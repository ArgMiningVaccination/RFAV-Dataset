A small clinical trial published in 2017 suggests this is possible. Based on a new unifying theory of pathogenesis for autism called the cell danger response (CDR)hypothesis, this study of 10 boys, ages 5 -14 years, showed that all 5 boys who received antipurinergic therapy (APT) with a single intravenous dose of suramin experienced improvements in all the core symptoms of autism that lasted for 5 -8 weeks. Language, social interaction, restricted interests, and repetitive movements all im- proved. Two children who were non-verbal spoke their rst sentences. None of these improvements were ob- served in the placebo group. Larger and longer studies are needed to con rm this promising discovery. This review introduces the concept of M2 (anti-in flammatory) and M1 (pro-in flammatory) mitochondria that are polarized along a functional continuum according to cell stress. The pathophysiology of the CDR, the com- plementary functions of M1 and M2 mitochondria, relevant gene-environment interactions, and the metabolic underpinnings of behavior are discussed as foundation stones for understanding the improvements in ASD be- haviors produced by antipurinergic therapy in this small clinical trial. 1. Background In over 20 years of modern clinical trial e orts ( McPheeters et al., 2011 ) and 75 years since the rst description of autism ( Kanner, 1943 ), no drug has been FDA approved to treat the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). I believe this is because the root cause of ASD is not yet understood. This has made it impossible to develop a unifying theory of pathogenesis that might help to guide new drug development. 2. The cell danger response hypothesis The Suramin Autism Treatment 1 (SAT1) study ( Naviaux et al., 2017 ) was the rst clinical trial to test a new unifying theory for the root cause and a new treatment of autism. The cell danger response hypothesis represents a paradigm shift in how scientists think about the cause of autism. Instead of focusing on a particular behavior, cell type, genes, the microbiome, synapses, or the connectivity of neural circuits in the brain, the cell danger hypothesis states that the root cause of autism is a universal cellular response to stress that shifts normal cell function to a new state. Severe and/or prolonged stress forces a re- allocation of cellular resources for survival. This universal response to stress traces to mitochondria and is called the cell danger response (CDR) ( Naviaux, 2014 ). Aspects of the CDR are also referred to as the integrated stress response ( Green et al., 2011; Nikkanen et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2009 ). The CDR gives the appearance of mitochondrialdysfunction, but is actually a normal, necessary, and highly regulated change in mitochondrial function from oxidative phosphorylation to cellular defense. This shift is needed to respond to a threat, and to heal after an injury. Mitochondria that defend the cell in danger can no longer function the same as they do under unstressed conditions (Naviaux et al., 2009). This programmed change in mitochondrial function is needed for innate immunity and in flammation ( West, 2017), which in turn are required for establishing the adaptive immune re- sponse and healing. 3. M1 and M2 mitochondria To emphasize the importance and dynamic nature of this pro- grammed change in mitochondrial function, I have designated these as M1 and M2 mitochondria ( Fig. 1). M1 and M2 mitochondria represent two poles on a functional continuum ( Sander and Garaude, 2017 ) regulated by the mitochondria are devoted to oxphos and are anti-in In contrast, M1 mitochondria are pro-in flammatory. Naviaux, 2012b). M1 mitochondria are and increase cellular redox (are pro-oxidants) and performdozens of other functions needed for anti-viral and anti-microbial de- fense. The shift from M2 to M1 mitochondrial functions is an intrinsic feature of an activated CDR. Within a given cell, this shift creates a spectrum from 100% M2 mitochondria when stress is minimum, to https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mito.2017.12.007 Received 15 September 2017; Received in revised form 11 December 2017; Accepted 14 December 2017E-mail address: Naviaux@ucsd.edu .Mitochondrion xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx 1567-7249/ \u00a9 2017 R.K., medium-stress conditions, up to 100% M1 when the survival of the cell is threatened. When the fu- sion-ssion cycle of mitochondria in a particular cell type is rapid (minutes to hours), as occurs in rapidly dividing cells in the bonemarrow and gut epithelium, this transition comes to a new steady-state within minutes to hours. When the fusion- ssion cycle of mitochondria is slow (for example, it is 2 weeks in the cardiac myocytes of adult mice(Song and Dorn II, 2015 )), the M2 to M1 transition occurs more slowly, and the M1 state lasts longer after the danger has passed. Otherdierentiation states of mitochondria exist. For example, the mi- tochondria in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige/bright cells in white adipose tissue (WAT) have distinct developmental origins (Kajimura and Saito, 2014 ). Pluripotential M0 mitochondria are present in stem ( et al., 2012) and primary oocytes ( Van Blerkom, 2011 ). The flammatory) to M1 (pro-in flammatory) mitochondria that occurs when a cell becomes threatened is not unlike the analogous shift in the functional state of macrophages from resting Fig. 1. Metabolic control of purinergic signaling. The availability of purinergic e ectors in the unstirred water layer where receptors and ligands meet is controlled by a suite of metabolic proteins and solute channels. A simpli ed summary of their actions, and the dynamic capacity for mitochondrial functional changes that are associated with the CDR are illustrated. Cellular zones: Bulk flow zone (BFZ), to helping to orchestrate the cell danger response (CDR). M2 mitochondria (oxphos). contain an acidic pool by NAADP acting on TCP. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains a neutral pool of calcium gated by cADPR acting on the ryanodine receptor (RyR). Exosomes are sphingolipid-enriched nanovesicles that are used for cell-cell signaling and the removal and exchange of intracellular materials. Proteins: Integral Membrane-associated enzymes (purple), Non-Integral membrane enzymes (green), Receptors and Ligand-gated channels (orange), and Non-ligand-gated Transport Channels (blue). \u2014The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), consisting of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, II, III, IV, and V. 10\u2014AMPD2: AMP deaminase blocked by suramin. 20 \u2014GLUT9a/SLC2A9: uric acid subfamily M, member 2. 29 \u2014TPC: two 30 (xxxx) xxx-xxx 2 M0 or polarized M2, to M1. The M1 phenotype of macrophages is pro- inflammatory and needed for cell defense, while M2 macrophages are anti-in flammatory and needed to facilitate the resolution of in- flammation and healing. This cellular polarization is strongly correlated with oxidative phenotype of the mitochondria within macrophages(Chen et al., 2017). When the choreographed sequence of metabolic steps in the healing cycle encounters a roadblock for any reason, apersistent form of the CDR results, and M1 pro-in flammatory mi- tochondria persist past the time they are needed. This changes thetrajectory of child development, and can lead to ASD and several other disorders. 4. ASD genetics, the CDR, and in flammation Each of the common genes known to strongly increase the risk of ASD can be shown to play a role in CDR signaling or maintenance. Fragile X is just one of several examples. The Fragile X gene FMR1 encodes a protein that normally inhibits the translation of proin- flammatory cytokines like TNF (Garnon et al., 2005). Decreased ex- pression of the Fragile X protein results in persistent activation of theCDR in the form of a low-grade in flammatory response in the brain ( Di Marco et al., 2016 ). Could therapy directed at the CDR be e ective in Fragile X, and other genetic causes of ASD? Antipurinergic therapy (APT) directed at the CDR has already proven e ective in correcting ASD-like behaviors in the Fragile X mouse model ( Naviaux et al., 2015 ). Rett syndrome is another example of a genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder that is tied to the cell danger response and in-flammation ( Cortelazzo et al., 2014). Most cases of Rett syndrome trace to new mutations in the MeCP2 gene, which codes for a methyl-CpGbinding protein. Mutations in MeCP2 alter chromatin structure and lead to retroelement mobilization ( Muotri et al., 2010), genetic instability, and profound changes in the innate immune response ( Derecki et al., 2012 ). The innate Naviaux, models of Rett syndrome are an im- portant reminder that even in some genetic causes of autism, the corebehavioral features of ASD are not permanent. Behaviors can be re- versed by treating the cell danger response that underlies oxidative changes and in flammation ( Derecki et al., ). Other examples include Angelman and Smith-Magenis syndrome. Angelman syndrome is usually caused by a de novo maternal deletion or mutation of a gene called ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) locatedon chromosome15q11-q13. UBE3A is involved in the unfolded protein response. Mutations in UBE3A result in the accumulation of unfolded proteins ( Mishra et al., 2009 ), which are in turn known to activate the CDR ( Smith, 2014 ). Smith-Magenis syndrome is usually caused by chromosomal copy number variation (CNV) resulting in a deletion of a patch of DNA on chromosome 17p11.2 containing the retinoic acid induced 1 (RAI1) gene ( Huang et al., 2016 ). This is not to be confused with the retinoic acid induced gene 1 (RIG1), a helicase on chromosome9. Defects in RAI1 result in increased childhood infections and im- munologic abnormalities ( Perkins et al., 2017) that result in repeated activation of the CDR. Future studies will be required to test therapiesdirected at the CDR in children with Fragile X, Rett, Angelman, and Smith-Magenis syndromes. 5. Cellular order, metabolism, defense, and immunity 5.1. Mitochondria and the CDR The daily operations of the cell require protein-protein and many other macromolecular interactions that rely critically on cellular spatial order \u2014packing \u2014for ecient function. When order is disrupted, func- tion su ers. Any kind of physical or biological injury to the cell de- creases electrons shuttled from nutrients to mitochondria. Mitochondrial electron flow acts as a barometer of cellular health. When mitochondrial electron transfer is disrupted a cellular metabolicsyndrome is produced. This new cellular metabolic state is needed for healing. This starts locally at the site of injury, but propagates to neighboring cells as they adopt a change in function to contain the injury. If the injury cannot be contained locally, systemic signals are sent by neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous systems that ultimately produce changes in systemic metabolism and behavior. Disruptions in molecular order or the organization of cytoskeleton and organelles within cells is perhaps one of the most fundamental signals of danger. Increasing cellular disorder is the biologic equivalent of increasing thermodynamic entropy. 5.2. The importance of water The decrease in the ordered state of macromolecules and solutes forces a change in the distribution, behavior, and thermodynamic properties of water molecules (H 2O) in and around cells ( Chaplin, 2006; Pollack, 2013; Prigogine and Nicolis, 1971 ). The partial positive and negative charge on a molecule of water, and other forces, constrain its movement by interacting with the surface charges around proteins, membranes, and cytoskeleton creating a fraction of bound or \"vicinal \" water that covers all biological surfaces. The more polymers or mem-branes in solution, the greater the fraction of bound to unbound water. The net e ect of increased acidity and increased dissolved oxygen in cells and tissues is to inhibit macromolecular (polymer) synthesis re-actions. Polymer synthesis reactions include the condensation of amino acids to make proteins and nucleotides to make RNA and DNA. This decreases the di erentiated functional capacity of the cell, but is re- quired to initiate healing after injury. Mitochondrial fusion- ssion dy- namics shift toward ssion to permit increased quality control under stress ( Youle and van der Bliek, 2012). Metabolic as membranes (MAMs) also change under stress, further al- tering the ordered intracellular structure of organellar networks. MAMs regulate calcium, phospholipid, sphingolipid exchange, and many other key physiologic processes ( Sano et al., 2009 ). Changes in mitochondrial dynamics during cell stress in tissues link increasing cytoplasmic dis-order with increasing disorder of water molecules, and an increase in CDR-associated functions. The monitoring of cellular disorder is fun- damental for normal immune system function ( Cunlie, 1997). 6. The CDR, redox, M1 mitochondria, and ASD Oxidative changes in autism have been well-studied ( James et al., 2006; Rose et al., 2017 ). Single cells make reactive oxygen species (ROS) to harden themselves when they come under attack by patho- genic organisms or environmental stress ( Naviaux, 2012b). Indeed, the mitochondria in cells make the very ROS that inhibit their own bioe-nergetic functions. This seems self-destructive, but it is not. The adap- tive function of the ROS-response cannot be understood within a single- cell frame of reference. The relevant frame of reference is the host considered as a collective system of many cells and tissues. Local ROS are responsible for activating a normal, but latent, alternative function of mitochondria in threatened cells. Under baseline conditions, tissue mitochondria exist mostly in an M2, or anti-in flammatory state dedi- cated to oxphos. When ROS are increased, mitochondria take on a newjob. They become polarized to M1 mitochondria, become an important source of ROS themselves, increase the rate of damaged organelle re- moval via intracellular quality control methods, and become the in- itiators and coordinators of the antiviral response ( Seth et al., 2005 ) and cellular defense ( West et al., 2011 ). To do this, mitochondria must temporarily drop their \"day job \"as the hub of oxidative phosphoryla- tion served by their M2 polarized state. The cell-autonomous inhibition of mitochondrial oxphos by ROS decreases both the production of cel- lular building blocks and the exchange of building blocks with other cells. The ROS-response and M1 polarization of mitochondria is adap- tive because it decreases the chances that a virus, or pathogenicR.K. Naviaux Mitochondrion xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx 3 organism, or damage from a traumatic or chemical injury or toxin can spread to kill the host. A line of cells in which mitochondrial oxphos is decreased, and lactic acid and ROS are increased, creates the cellular equivalent of sealing the bulkheads that separate the compartments on a damaged ship or submarine to prevent the spread of more water to undamaged sections. Furthermore, when the metabolic rate of a single cell is decreased relative to neighboring cells, the local clock of biolo- gical time within that cell slows, permitting it to resist maturation and outlast the cells unable to use fewer resources for survival. For this and other reasons, the author favors the term \"oxidative shielding \"instead of\"oxidative stress \"(Naviaux, 2012b ). The host bene ts strongly from the ability of single cells to shift nimbly from peacetime M2 metabolism to defensive M1 metabolism needed for damage containment in re- sponse to environmental stress. When viewed contextually, it can be understood that this is not \"mitochondrial dysfunction \". The M1 state is an adaptive, new function of mitochondria that is produced when cellscome under stress. Chronic disease results when this cell danger re- sponse cannot be turned o when its job is done. 7. The CDR, exosomes, and the immune response in ASD Stressed cells increase the number and diversity of lipid nanove- sicles called exosomes that they release into the extracellular space(Fig. 1)( Nemeth et al., 2017 ). Exosomes are in stress- and danger-signaling sphingolipids, self-antigens that include metabolicenzymes from internal compartments of the cell, micro-RNAs, mi- tochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and help remove non-infectious aggregates of proteins like - amyloid, -synuclein, and tau that might otherwise accumulate inside the cell and become toxic ( Rajendran et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017). Exosomes are also critical for many forms of cell-cell communication involved in fundamental biological processes like fer- tilization ( Machtinger et al., 2016) and al., 2011 ). Viruses and microbial pathogens are known to hijack exosomes for cell-to-cell transmission. To combat this, certain inter- feron-induced genes like ISG15 have evolved that decrease total cell protein synthesis and exosome release from infected cells. This creates a reduction in cell-to-cell communication through exosome release, but permits more e cient disposal of pathogens within the cell by fusion with lysosomes ( Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2017). Another function of exosomes is to permit the export and recycling of biochemical building blocks produced during normal cell function(Fig. 1). Exosome release and reuptake into neighboring or distant cells occurs naturally during the turnover of billions of cells that occurs dailyby apoptosis. Naturally occurring molecules like mtDNA, -galacto- sylceramide rafts, formyl-methionine containing mitochondrialpeptides, released ATP and UTP, and other molecules can stimulate toll- like receptors (TLRs) and related stress-sensing receptors on B1 cells and support the production of naturally occurring, low-a nity, IgM antibodies. These natural autoantibodies (NAAs) are present from birth,are produced by T-cell independent, TLR-stimulated B1 cells, and anti-in flammatory ects ( Lobo, 2017). Low-titer IgM antibodies to self-antigens are increased after surgery and other traumas ( Raad et al., 2014) because of increased release of material from stressed or damaged cells ( Oka et al., 2012 ). These natural autoantibodies play an important protective role, limiting in flammation ( Andaluz-Ojeda et al., 2013 ). Once the trauma or cellular damage is healed, exosome pro- duction, and other cellular sources of antigens are diminished, and autoantibody production is returned to background levels. If antigenpresentation continues because of ongoing stress or infection, then high-a nity IgG antibodies can be stimulated, selected, and ampli ed. Autoantibodies to the folate receptor ( Frye et al., 2016a and ma- et al., 2017 are like pediatricacute-onset syndrome (PANS), pediatric autoimmuneneuropsychiatric and autonomic disturbances like postural orthostatic ta- chycardia syndrome (POTS) are also risks in ASD. The chronically ac- tivated CDR can also lead to sleep disturbances, seizures, leaky gut, gut inflammation, and dysmotility. Thyroid abnormalities re flected by an increase in the rT3 also occur ( Frye et al., 2017 ). This may be a con- sequence of stress induction of the selenoproteins, deiodinases 2 and 3 (DIO2 and 3), that are responsible for inactivating T4 and producing reverse T3 (rT3) ( ). regulates Th17 cells through purinergic signaling ( Sullivan et al., 2014). Th17 cells and Th17 receptor expression on monocytes play several important roles in regulating breaches in immune tolerance ( Pfeifle et al., 2017 ), and Nadeem et 2017 ). 8. The CDR, natural infections, and vaccinations The CDR is a normal and universal feature of any stress. This means that it is normally activated by both natural infections and vaccination. The CDR is needed to establish cellular and humoral immunity. Since the large majority of children and adults who receive vaccinations, or are exposed to common natural viral infections like Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), are able to recover without incident, the biological question is, \"Why are some children and adults unable to moderate or turn o the CDR when its job is done and immunity is established? \"We do not have an answer to this question yet. However, relatively simple measures like distributing vaccinations over time, instead of giving a large number at once would decrease the chances of triggering an excessive CDR in individual children deemed to be at increased risk. In addition, future research into the metabolomic phenotypes of children before and after vaccinations may begin to shine some light on di erences in natural metabolic and physiologic states, that might permit us to predict the risk and develop treatments to prevent the rare complications like post- immunization, febrile seizures ( MacDonald et al., 2014 ). 9. Gene-environment interactions in ASD 9.1. Managing environmental risks The CDR is triggered by both genes and environmental factors. Genes, and the proteins they make, can be thought of as providing adaptive resilience, like stretch in a homeostatic safety net, to a large number of stressors. When new, more frequent, or more severe ex- posures are encountered, the adaptive and healing capacity of cells can be pushed to, and beyond its homeostatic limits. This creates road- blocks to healing that result in a persistent form of the CDR. Environmental factors that can test the resilience of any given genotype include physical, chemical, nutritional, microbial, and psychological traumas. Infections during pregnancy ( Zerbo et al., 2013), prenatal maternal psychological stress ( Kinney et al., 2008; Ronald et al., 2010), early life stress ( Cameron et al., 2017; Heun-Johnson and Levitt, 2016; Rutter et al., 2001 ), and exposure to a variety of toxins ( Braun et al., 2014 ), metals ( Kalkbrenner et al., 2014; Palmer et al., 2009 ), or tra c- related air pollution ( Volk et al., 2011; Volk et al., 2013) have each been shown to contribute to ASD risk. Combinations of all these factors in a particular home, neighborhood, city, or rural environment con- tribute to the concept of total toxic load ( Herbert et al., 2013). If the exposure happens during critical periods in early child development,ASD and several other childhood disorders can result ( Landrigan et al., 2012 ). When avoidable risks are managed, pregnancy outcomes and child health can be improved ( Adams et al., 2016; Schmidt et al., 2011). 9.2. Ecogenetics, ecoalleles, and ASD Recent twin studies show that environmental factors are responsible for about 60% (mean = 58%; 95% CI = 30- 80%) of ASD. The collec- tive contribution of all genes about 40% (mean = 37%; 95% Hallmayer et al., 2011 ), but no single gene accounts for more than 1- 2% of all of ASD ( Talkowski et al., 2014 ). The term ecogenetics describes the interaction between genes and environment. Many genes show strong di erences in function depending on exposure to di erent environmental factors. These \"ecoalleles \"are common gene about 2% -50% \u2014in enzymes, receptors, transporters, and transcription factors that havedierent activities depending on environmental factors. Some of these environmental factors include seasonal and diurnal temperature fluc- tuations, or the availability of calories, fats or carbohydrates, trace metals, redox, critical pyridoxine (B6), or exposureto drugs, pesticides, or toxins. The prevalence of ecoalleles in di erent populations around the world di ers signi cantly according to di erent climatic, dietary, in- fectious disease, and cultural conditions. For example, the ecoallelec.677T in methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is rare in populations from sub-Saharan Africa (5%), but more common in Mexican, Italian, and Ashkenazi Jewish populations where it has an allelic frequency of about 50% ( Karban et al., 2016 ). The risk of disease associated with the c.677T ecoallele is context dependent. Despitebeing more common in Ashkenazi Jewish populations, the c.677T allele in MTHFR was a risk factor for autism, in flammatory bowel disease, and certain other diseases in non-Ashkenazi populations but not inAshkenazi populations ( Frye and James, 2014; Karban et al., 2016 ). If ecoalleles were always harmful in all world contexts at all ages, theywould eventually be removed from the ancestral gene pool, or reduced to frequencies well below 1%. Alleles that cause disease in post-re- productive adults can be maintained by advantages to children or young adults. In the case of MTHFR, it has been hypothesized that the c.677T variant confers resistance to malaria ( Meadows et al., 2014). In sub-Saharan Africa, the sickle-cell hemoglobin trait became the most common genetic form of resistance to malaria. In other regions where dierent ecological and nutritional factors played a role in the selection of mechanisms of pathogen resistance that were not limited to malaria,MTHFR variants became more widespread, as in historical populations in southern Europe and Mexico. Other ecoalleles include variants selection maintains the prevalence of ecoalleles at frequencies of about 2%-50% because they have environment- and context-dependent tness advantages, some- times manifested only as the heterozygote carrier genotype. 9.3. The CDR activates the moonlighting functions of ecoalleles As discussed above, M1 mitochondria use ROS to activate their la- tent/moonlighting function as coordinators of the cell danger responseunder conditions of environmental stress. Many metabolic enzymes also have moonlighting functions that are induced by new environmental conditions ( Sriram et al., 2005 ). These moonlighting functions often seem self-destructive unless understood in terms of the cell danger re-sponse (CDR) ( Naviaux, 2014). dehydrogenase (DLD), alsoknown as the shared by 5 di erent mi- tochondrial enzyme systems that are critical for regulating cellularbioenergetics, redox, and amino acid metabolism. The enzyme and cleavage system. Each of these 5 key enzyme systems can be a ected when DLD changes from its canonical function to its moonlighting function under conditions of environmental stress.This leads to CDR-associated chromatin remodeling because alpha ke- toglutarate et al., 2016 ). The net result is to slow gene expres- sion and metabolism in stressed cells. Over 90 DNA currently classied as benign or likely benign. Some of these may in fact be ecoalleles of DLD that have not yet been fully characterized. SeveralDLD variants are strongly inhibited by valproate, creating an ecogenetic risk for drug-induced liver toxicity ( Kudin et al., 2017 ). Under conditions of low mitochondrial matrix pH produced by ischemia-reperfusion, high salt concentration, and other stresses, DLD changes from its normal dimeric conformation and adopts an oligo- meric or monomeric structure. The normal DLD activity is lost as the moonlighting functions of the E3 protein are activated by stress. The rst new activity to emerge is reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Ambrus and Adam-Vizi, 2017) using NADH and oxygen for oxidative shielding in response to microbial infection or other stress ( Naviaux, 2012b ). This accompanies the flammatory to M1 pro-in flammatory mitochondria. Progressive stress leads to the trans- formation to monomer con guration and unmasks a cryptic frataxin (Babady et al., 2007 ). This leads to a prolonged shift from M2 to M1 mitochondria after transient but severe stress ( Klyachko et al., 2005). Disruptions in iron-sulfur cluster assembly can have profound a ects on dozens of proteins in key pathways of the cell danger response. Amongthese are viperin and ABCE1 used in the antiviral response, aconitase in the Krebs cycle, subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain com- plexes I, II, and III needed for energy production, and DNA repair proteins like XPD and FANCJ ( metabolic treatments Mixtures of ecoalleles, with and without moonlighting functions, produce new phenotypes and patterns of disease risk and resilience thatrepresent latent traits that are revealed by exposure to speci c en- vironmental triggers. While single ecoalleles can like common variants ( Schuck and Grillo, 2016), mixtures of ecoalleles are conditional and have emergentphenotypes that cannot be predicted from genomic analysis alone. Ecoalleles create resilience in the homeostatic safety net that helps life manage environmental infections, toxins, famine, vascular and tissue injury, and other stressors. The combined e ect of unique mixtures of ecoalleles is to create metabolic phenotypes that are key targets fornatural selection and evolution. Emergent metabolic traits are the result of real-time interaction of genes and environment. Their tness depends on the environmental context. What permits survival under harsh conditions may slow reproduction or development under mild condi- tions. When environmental conditions change over the course of child development, and harsh conditions alternate with mild, or harsh con- ditions begin to be more common than mild, recovery from the survival or defensive cellular state can be delayed or persist. Some of theR.K. Naviaux Mitochondrion xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx 5 persistence of these traits can be driven by durable epigenetic changes that trace to mitochondrial function ( Minocherhomji et al., 2012; Naviaux, 2008; Wallace and Fan, 2010 ), but produce changes in gene expression that can persist beyond their utility because of time lags between frequent activation in a harsh environment, and recovery. Under these changing environmental conditions, mixtures of ecoalleles and epigenetic changes that were once advantageous may become a disadvantage. When this happens in ASD, cofactor and metabolic therapies directed at ecoallele-driven phenotypes in ASD can help strengthen resilience in the homeostatic safety net and improve beha- vioral symptoms ( Frye et al., 2013a, 2016b). 10. Metabolism and ASD behavior The idea that behaviors in autism are caused by a change inmetabolism is not new. The rst organic abnormalities reported in ASD were metabolic ( Rimland, 1964; Sutton and Read, 1958)( Table 1). Several genetic disorders of purine and pyrimidine ( Micheli et al., 2011; Nyhan et al., 1969; Page and Coleman, 2000 ) and energy metabolism (Stockler-Ipsiroglu and van Karnebeek, 2014) are associated with au- tistic behaviors. Bernie Rimland, the founder of the Autism ResearchInstitute (ARI), pioneered the metabolic approach to treatment in the rst clinical trial of pyridoxine in children with ASD ( Rimland et al., 1978 ). When cells detect genetic or environmental threats, mitochon- drial function changes in a predictable way. These changes produce the CDR and act as a two-edged sword. On the one hand, the change in cell metabolism allows threatened cells surrounding the injury to better survive dangerous conditions. On the other hand, when these changes become widespread and occur during pregnancy or the rst 3 years of life, and are severe or sustained, they can alter the trajectory of normalTable 1 Metabolic disturbances in autism spectrum disorder.

Naviaux Mitochondrion xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx 6 child development. The CDR produces e ects on purinergic signaling that change how neural circuits are selected and how synapses are formed and pruned in the brain ( Sipe et al., 2016). Many other organ systems are also a ected by the CDR. These include the immune system, the gut microbiome, and the autonomic nervous system. Each of these is documented to be dysfunctional in autism. Over 30 metabolic abnormalities have been described in ASD over the past 60 years ( Table 1). All are known markers of the cell danger response ( Naviaux, 2014; Naviaux et al., 2016). Interestingly, this set of about 30 di erent metabolic pathways is shared with the conserved cellular response to danger or threat regardless of whether the triggerwas a virus ( Wikoet al., 2009), a bacterium ( Degtyar et al., 2009 ), genetic forms of mitochondrial disease ( Nikkanen et al., ), or neurodevelopmental with complex gene-environment patho- genic mechanisms like autism ( James et al., 2004). The hopeful mes- sage behind the CDR hypothesis is that the root cause of the commu-nication di culties, social anxiety, sensory abnormalities, GI problems, seizures, allergies, and many other comorbidities in autism, is a trea-table metabolic syndrome. This means that contrary to classical teaching in medical schools around the world for the past 70 years, autism may not be permanent in some children. By treating the root cause, the CDR hypothesis gives hope that longstanding roadblocks to development can be removed and the children can make remarkable progress, despite a great heterogeneity in the causes of ASD. Future clinical trials will be needed to test this hypothesis rigorously. 11. Purinergic signaling and ASD11.1. Purinergic signaling maintains the CDR If the CDR is the problem, what is the cellular signal that keeps it turned on after it is no longer needed for healing? To answer this question, researchers had to weave together several apparently un- related threads. These threads included research on mitochondria and healing ( Naviaux et al., 2009 ), genetic forms of mitochondrial dys- function in autism ( Graf et al., 2000 ), genetic forms of autism asso- ciated with increased purine metabolism ( Nyhan et al., 1969), and the paradoxical improvement with fever that proved that the core beha-viors of autism could be dynamically regulated by metabolism ( Curran et al., 2007 ). The author hypothesized that the root cause of patholo- gical persistence of the CDR was continued excessive or unbalanced purinergic signaling, called hyperpurinergia ( Naviaux et al., 2013 ), and dyspurinergia, respectively. Hyperpurinergia is a universal and normal feature of the immediate and subacute cellular response to injury. Stressed cells release ATP andother small molecules less than about 800 Da in size through specia- lized membrane channels. The pannexin/P2X7 porin is an example of one of these ( Burnstock and Knight, 2017; Naviaux, 2012b ). available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= zIdUufy8Lks traceable to mitochondria) are released through the stress-gated channels in the cell membrane, they bind to receptors on the cell sur- face to signal danger. Nineteen (19) purinergic receptors have been cloned. There are 8 P2Y receptors, 7 P2X receptors, and 4 P1 (adeno- sine) receptors. Extracellular ATP, ADP, adenosine, and et al., 2015 ). Many di erent disease processes are regulated by purinergic signaling ( Burnstock, 2014 ). Once the danger has passed, the release of ATP decreases, the CDR turns o , cells can complete the healing cycle, and return to normal \"peacetime \"function. Mixtures of CDR triggers can be synergistic. This contributes to theconcept of total toxic load. Sequential exposures during critical devel- opmental windows can stack to create a \"perfect storm \"of events that can derail the healing process and lead to pathological persistence ofthe CDR. 11.2. Nucleotide metabolism regulates purinergic signaling In principle, hyperpurinergia can be produced by increased release of ATP and related receptor ligands, increased nucleotide dwell time caused by decreased metabolism or inactivation of purinergic e ectors, a failure of receptors to desensitize once their job is done, or a com-bination of each. The dwell time of extracellular nucleotides in the pericellular halo is tightly regulated by cell-speci c expression of (ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1) and CD73 (ecto-5 - nucleotidase) on the cell membrane. These proteins convert extra- cellular ATP and ADP to AMP (CD39), and AMP adenosine (CD73) in and magnesium-dependent ( Antonioli et al., 2013 ) (Fig. 1). Adenosine is then either taken up by the cell through the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 PNP does not accept adenosine as a substrate and is not a source of adenine. Adenine base can be produced by methyl- polyamine synthesis Mavrakis et al., 2016). Free adenine can be re- leased or taken up by cells via the equilibrative nucleobase transporter(ENBT1, SLC43A3). When taken up, adenine is used of AMP by adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT). Hy- poxanthine can be taken up by cells for salvage synthesis of purines via membrane transporters like the concentrative sodium-dependent nu- IMP. Hypoxanthine also be oxidized in the extracellular space to xanthine and uric acid, with the production converted and NAADP activate calcium infl ux via the TRPM2 membrane channels. Inside the cell, cADPR releases calcium from the ER through the ryanodine receptor (RyR), and NAADP releases acidic calcium stores from lysosomes through the two pore channel (TPC) proteins. In anti-in M2 polarized favors NADPH and NADPH and oxygen acid transported into the cell by the cytokine- regulated uric acid transporter SLC2A9 ( So and Thorens, 2010 ) and can stimulate in flammation directly by triggering the assembly of the NLRP3 in flammasome ( Ghaemi-Oskouie and Shi, 2011 )(Fig. 1). UTP, UDP, and UDP-glucose are also released from cells under stress and act as signaling molecules that bind to purinergic receptors. CD39and CD73 can also be metabolized uridine the free nucleobase uracil and ribose-1-phosphate. Uracil can be imported as a free nucleobase into the cell by SNBT1. Uridine is transported into the cell through ENT1. Inside the cell, ur- idine is salvaged by phosphorylation by uridine-cytidine kinase 1 and 2 (UCK1/2). By regulating content of the un- stirred water layer (UWL) produced by the release of extracellular ATP and UTP can be precisely calibrated in accordance with the functional states of each responding cell type ( Fig. 1).R.K. Naviaux Mitochondrion xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx 7 11.3. Purinergic signaling, the CDR, and the symptoms of ASD When healing is incomplete, cells can be left in a state of hyper- or hypo-responsiveness to new threats. Chronic changes in purinergic signaling alter pain perception ( Magni et al., 2017), and the processing of other sensory stimuli ( Breza and Travers, 2016; Dietz et al., 2012 ). This is not unlike a cellular form of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting in durable changes in behavior after exposure to a transient, but serious stress. Cells cannot heal if a signi cant fraction of ATP is exported for purposes of signaling danger instead of being keptin the cell for normal energy metabolism. The use of antipurinergic drugs like suramin to treat a mis ring CDR has been called \"molecular armistice therapy \"because it sends a signal that \"the war is over \". This decreases losses of ATP through stress-gated membrane channels, and decreases purinergic autocrine and paracrine signaling of danger (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIdUufy8Lks ) so cells and mi- tochondria can return to peacetime metabolism needed for healing anddevelopment. The concept that purinergic signaling abnormalities are involved in ASD and can alter behavior is not just theoretical. Evidence of purinergic signaling abnormalities was found in children with ASD in a recent gene expression study ( Ginsberg et al., 2012 ). Purinergic sig- naling has been shown to regulate a number of the cellular comorbid-ities and functional abnormalities associated with ASD ( Table 2). 12. Preclinical studies of antipurinergic therapy The idea that purinergic signaling might be involved in autism was born in 2008 (Naviaux research supported by Mr. Dan Wright). In 2010,the Naviaux Lab received a \"Trailblazer \"award from Autism Speaks (https://autismspeaksblog.wordpress.com/tag/mitochondria/ ) to test this idea. Suramin has many actions ( Liu and Zhuang, 2011; Voogd et al., 1993 ). One of its most studied actions is pur- et al., 2013 ) describing the results of the rst suramin treatment studies in ASD mouse models showed that abnormal persistence of extracellularATP signaling could cause ASD-like behaviors. It also produced ex- citoxicity that led to the death of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Re- balancing the CDR with suramin restored normal behavior and pre- vented the loss of these cells ( Naviaux et al., 2013). Two additional studies con rmed that antipurinergic therapy with the non-selective purinergic inhibitor suramin improved both the core behaviors and the metabolic syndrome underlying autism-like symptoms in both the Fragile X genetic model and the environmental maternal immune ac- tivation (MIA) models ( Naviaux et al., 2014; Naviaux et al., 2015 ). The mouse models also showed that high doses were not necessary. Low-dose suramin that produced blood levels of just 5 -15M was both safe and eective in treating the symptoms of autism in these models. 13. Results of the SAT1 clinical trial 13.1. Metabolic abnormalities in ASD were improved by low-dose suramin Using mass spectrometry, the metabolic pathways that were dis- turbed at baseline and changed by suramin were characterized in two mouse models of ASD-like behavior. Suramin treatment improved 17 of 18 (94%) biochemical pathways that were abnormal in the MIA mouse model ( Naviaux et al., 2014 ) and 20 of 20 (100%) pathways disturbed in the Fragile X mouse model ( Naviaux et al., 2015 ). Metabolomic analysis was also performed in the 10 children with ASD in the SAT1 study ( Naviaux et al., 2017 ). This study showed that 21 of 28 (75%) of the pathways disturbed in children with autism were also abnormal in the mouse models. These included improvements in purines, 1-carbon/ folate, metabolism, and others ( Naviaux et al., 2017 )(Fig. 2). These improvements in metabolism were asso- ciated with similar improvements in each of the core symptoms ofautism. There was a flowering of interest in social communication, new language, new social activities on the playground like playing tag, andat home like playing catch and other games with neurotypical siblings. The half-life of suramin after a single-dose was 14.7 \u00b1 0.7 days. Stu- dies in African sleeping sickness have shown that the plasma half-life of suramin can increase to 1 or 2 months after multiple doses ( Hawking, 1940 ). As the single dose of suramin in the SAT1 study gradually wore oover 5- 8 weeks, metabolism drifted back toward baseline, and most of the behavioral gains were lost. It is not yet known if regular suramingiven every month or so could support continued developmental gains.These studies strongly underscore the hopeful message that the symp- toms of autism might be caused by a treatable metabolic syndrome and that antipurinergic therapy with low-dose suramin is a powerful tool in treating these fundamental metabolic abnormalities. 13.2. Core symptoms of ASD were improved by low-dose suramin Low-dose of suramin used Naviaux et al., 2017 ) improved the core symptoms of ASD measured by ADOS2 (autism di- agnostic observation schedule, 2 ndedition) score by 1.6 \u00b1 0.55 points in 6 weeks (p < 0.0028; Fig. 3).

Sur- amin treatment was synergistic with regular school, educational en-richment programs, applied behavioral analysis (ABA), speech, and occupational therapy. None of these improvements were observed in the placebo group. The authors reported that the maximum bene t from a single dose of suramin occurred after 3 weeks then decreasedslowly. Even after 6 weeks, three children had improved by 2 pointsand two children improved by 1 point, compared to baseline. No chil- dren were unimproved in the treatment group. In comparison, three children who received placebo were unchanged, and two improved by 1 point each. This gave rise to an estimate of the placebo e ect of 0.4 \u00b1 0.55 points ( Fig. 3; p = 0.18; ns). ADOS comparison scores of 7-9 are used as a gold standard for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). An ADOS score of 10 meets criteria for classical autism.If a few doses of suramin given over 3 months produce improvements at the same rate of 1 point per month, then children with symptoms that were initially severe enough to be on the spectrum (ASD = ADOS comparison scores of 7- 9), might be able to come o the autism spec- trum (dotted red box), and those with more severe forms of autismmight improve signi cantly ( Fig. 3). Does this mean suramin might be therst eective drug treatment for autism in nearly 75 years of re- search e orts? It is too early to say. Some biomedical treatments of ASD show bene ts for a few weeks or months, then lose e ectiveness over time. There is no evidence this could happen with suramin, but more clinical trials are needed. We need to know if a few doses given over a few months are safe and are able to maintain the same rates of ADOS score improvement of about 1 point per month of treatment. If this is true, then we are one step closer to the goal. 13.3. Low-dose suramin safety Low-dose suramin that produced blood levels of just 5 -15M, was safe and produced signi cant improvement in ASD symptoms at 6 weeks in the SAT1 trial ( Naviaux et al., 2017)( Fig. 4). This low dose of suramin has never been studied before. The side e ect pro le of high- dose suramin (150 -270M) is known from cancer chemotherapy stu- dies ( Stein, 1993). One author has expressed concern about the safety of high-dose suramin ( Theoharides, 2013 ) citing a review of cancer stu- dies ( Kaur et al., 2002) that used prolonged exposure to high-doses of suramin that produced 25-times higher blood levels than those needed Fig. 2. Biochemical abnormalities of autism were improved by low-dose suramin. The gure lists the pathways that were improved by anti- purinergic therapy with suramin in children with ASD in the SAT1 study. Twenty-one of 28 (75%)of the metabolic pathway abnormalities werealso improved by suramin in the maternal im- mune activation (MIA) and Fragile X mouse models of autism. Each of these pathways isknown to play a role in the cell danger response (CDR). The observation that the core symptoms of ASD were improved with the metabolic path- ways known to be associated with the CDR, supports the hypothesis that the behavioral symptoms of autism may be caused by a treatable metabolic syndrome.Adapted from ( Naviaux et al., 2017 3. A single dose of suramin Improved ADOS scores by 1.6 points in 6 weeks. ADOS2 comparison scores of 7 -10 (gray box) are used as a gold standard for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and classical autism. A single dose of suramin resulted in a 1.6 \u00b1 0.55 point improvement in ADOS scores, from a mean of 8.6 \u00b1 0.9, to 7.0 \u00b1 0.7 (p < 0.0028) when measured after 6 weeks. If a few doses of suramin given over 3 months produce improvements at the same rate of 1 point/month, then some children would be able to come o the autism spectrum (dotted red box), and those with more severe forms of autism might improve signi cantly. [Data from the SAT1 study (Naviaux et ); N = 5 per group.]R.K. Naviaux Mitochondrion xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx 9 to treat autism ( Naviaux et al., 2017 ). Cancer studies typically used a dose and schedule of suramin designed produced blood levels of 250M compared to 10 M used in the SAT1 study. High doses of most drugs have toxicities that are not seen at lower doses. The safety andside e ect pro le from medium-dose suramin (50 -100M) is well known from nearly 100 years of study in African sleeping sickness(Hawking, 1940, 1978 ). This work showed that when a cumulative dose of 2.5 -3 g/m 2was divided into ve, weekly intravenous infusions over a month, the elimination half-life increased from 2 weeks to 1.5-2 months, and suramin concentrations 4M(5 mg/L; MW = 1297 were safely maintained for at least 6 months.About 10% of patients treated were rapid excretors and did not main- tain these concentrations for as long ( Hawking, 1978 ). These studies were done in Africa before the era of pharmacogenomics, so futurestudies in more ethnically diverse patient populations may reveal ge- netic di erences in the handling and response to suramin that cannot yet be predicted. The side e ect pro le of low-dose suramin, given for several months is unknown. Future studies are needed to answer four big questions: 1) Do all children with ASD bene t, or just a fraction? 2) Does suramin lose e ectiveness after a few months, or do children continue to bene t for as long as the drug levels in the blood are above 5M? 3) Does suramin need to be given for life, or are 4 -8 doses over 6-12 months su cient for normal child development to become self- sustaining? and 4) How long can low-dose suramn be used safely? 14. Sparking a Renaissance in drug development 14.1. Suramin as the rst antipurinergic drug Like the rst antibiotic, or rst beta-blocker for high blood pressure, suramin is the rst antipurinergic drug (APD). APDs represent a class of medicines that is completely new to the world 's pharmacopeia. Soon other drugs that work like suramin will be developed ( Jacobson and M\u00fcller, 2016). Eventually, the goal of this new Renaissance would be to create a shelf-full of APDs, each with slightly di erent pharmacologic properties that would allow doctors to pick and choose the best match for each patient. The recent discovery that suramin prevents Zika, Ebola, 2016; Ren et al., 2017) from in- fecting cells may prompt additional clinical trials and further interest inAPD development. Currently however, suramin is the only non-selec- tive APD available for human use. Research into the role of purinergicsignaling in autism is so new that we do not yet know which of the 19purinergic receptors are most relevant. Suramin is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of most purinergic signaling systems. Several P2Y12-selective antagonists like Plavix (clopidogrel) are used as antiplatelet agents to prevent blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks. However, their safety and activity in autism is unknown. Brilliant Blue G (BBG) is a P2X7 inhibitor and protein binding dye that has been used successfully in animal models to prevent excessive in- flammation after spinal cord injury ( Peng et al., 2009 ), Parkinson dis- ease ( et al., injury (Abdelaziz et al., 2017). BBG is also widely used by ophthalmologists during retinal surgery ( Azuma et al., 2016 ). Several experimental APDs are in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis and pain that target the P2X7 receptor, but none are yet available to prescribing physicians. It islikely that novel antipurinergic activities will be found in herbs, fungi, and other natural products distributed throughout the biosphere ( Faria et al., 2012; Soares-Bezerra et al., 2013 ). Some may already be in use but their essential pharmacologic action as purinergic inhibitors is notyet known. Alternatively, knowledge of the synthetic chemical ad- ditives in our food chain that activate or inhibit purine and pyrimidine signaling ( Ferreira et al., 2016), may shed new light on why some food colorings and additives are a problem in some children ( Weiss, 2012 ). 14.2. Current clinical trials of antipurinergic drugs In 2017, a search of the keyword \"purinergic \"among interventional trials in clinicaltrials.gov returned 418 studies in the US. Currently, over 90% of these studies are focused on platelets and heart disease.However, the broad involvement of purinergic signaling in nearly every chronic disease in which it has been studied ( Burnstock, 2017 ) suggests great potential for the development of this new class of medications. 15. Conclusions Over $1 billion has been spent on genetic research in autism over the past 10 years by the NIH, Autism Speaks, and the Simons Foundation. This work has shown that hundreds of genes play a role in dierent children, and that no single gene accounts for more than 1 -2% of autism ( Talkowski et al., 2014 ). While most genetic studies conclude that each genetic cause of ASD must be treated di erently, the CDR hypothesis suggests that one mechanism \u2014a uni ed cellular re- sponse \u2014might be at the root of all the di erent causes of autism. In addition, the CDR hypothesis comes with a detailed molecular me-chanism and a treatment. This new theory has already been rigorously tested in the lab since 2011 and found successful in classical animal models of autism. It also showed promise in 10 children with ASD as a unifying theory of pathogenesis in the SAT1 clinical trial ( Naviaux et al., 2017 ). 15.1. The economic impact of a treatment for ASD The average family caring for a child with ASD in the US spends over $17,000 annually in extra costs not covered by the health care and educational systems ( Lavelle et al., 2014 ). About 3.5 million Americans today live with ASD ( Buescher et al., 2014 ). Using the current estimates of 1 in 68 ( Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network Surveillance Year Principal et al., 2014) to 1 in 45 ( Zablotsky et al., 2015 ) children in the US with ASD and a birthrate of 4 million children per year, about 75,000 \u00b1 15,000 children will be diagnosed with ASD this year in the United States. The national economic cost of autism in the US is esti-mated to be $268 billion annually, or close to $75,000 per year per patient with ASD. This could rise to $461 billion by 2025 if the rising prevalence of ASD is not stopped ( Leigh and Du, 2015). If a new treatment could help just 10% of patients come o the autism spectrum, it would bring back over $26 billion into the US economy each year ($268 billion \u00d7 10% = $26.8 billion). The nancial return from this Fig. 4. Low-dose suramin was safe in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The safety and toxicity of suramin are dose-dependent.

Naviaux Mitochondrion xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx 10 discovery in a single year would be enough to support over 100 years of autism research funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The 2016 budget for autism research projects at NIH was $232 million (https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx ;$26.8 billion saved \u00f7 $0.232 billion/year NIH budget = 115 years). 15.2. Human impact If autism is proven to be a treatable metabolic syndrome in some children, it means that some children now living with disabling forms of ASD, whose parents fear might never be able to live independently, could have a chance for independence and live happy, self-reliant lives. In addition, ASD often a ects children who have shown early gifts and might otherwise grow up to become some of the best and brightest oftheir generation. If new science can lift their disabling symptoms without touching the unique gifts that make them special, the children with ASD today could grow up to become the young men and women of tomorrow who can think creatively to crack the problems that no one else can \u2014to solve our technological problems, to ease social unrest, protect the environment, and help create a healthier future for us all. 16. Special note from the author Until recently, the public has not heard the name of a new drug until it has been approved by the FDA to treat a particular disorder and it is ready to be marketed by its manufacturer. This has the bene cial eect of protecting patients from asking for, or trying a drug that has not yetbeen proven safe and e ective for their disease. A growing number of drugs are experiencing new interest as researchers discover new uses for old drugs. This is called \"drug repurposing \". Drug repurposing is not as simple as using an old drug \"o-label \"to treat a new disorder. Many drugs are not safe or e ective when used this way. Many times the dose and schedule, and even the fundamental pharmacology, like the half-life and volume of distribution, of a drug are di erent in di erent pa- tient populations. Careful clinical trials are needed to establish safetyand ecacy for each new indication. Suramin is approved to treat African sleeping sickness (trypanoso- miasis). It is not approved for the treatment of autism. There is cur- rently no approved use of suramin in the United States. It is illegal to import suramin into the US for human use without FDA approval. Like many intravenous drugs, when administered improperly by untrained personnel, at the wrong dose and schedule, without careful measure- ment of drug levels and monitoring for toxicity, suramin can cause harm. Careful clinical trials will be needed over several years at several sites to learn how to use low-dose suramin safely in autism, and to identify drug-drug interactions and rare side e ects that cannot cur- rently be predicted. The author strongly cautions against the un-authorized use of suramin. Ultimately, clinical trials may show that suramin is not the nal answer for autism. Its e ects may be limited to a small number of children, or they may not last, or side e ects may emerge. However, the discovery that the cell danger response and purinergic signaling are fundamental features of ASD is now stimu- lating new research around the world. New antipurinergic drugs, and the rediscovery of old ones, will not be far behind. Funding All funding for these studies was philanthropic. This work was supported in part by gifts from the UCSD Christini Fund, the William Wright Family Foundation, the Autism Research Institute (ARI), theLennox Foundation, the Gupta Family and Satya Fund, the Agrawal Family, Linda Clark, the N of One Autism Research Foundation, the Rodakis Family, the It Takes Guts Foundation, the UCSD Mitochondrial Disease Research Fund, Dr. Elizabeth Mumper Cooper, the Daniel and Kelly White Family, the Brent Kaufman Family, Fred and Sylvia Fogel, the David Cannistraro Family, Ian and Rochelle Yankwitt, George andCaryn Harb, the Francis Clougherty Charitable Trust, and the HeritageYouth Foundation. Funding for the mass spectrometers was provided by a gift from the Jane Botsford Johnson Foundation. Conflicts of interest RKN is a scienti c advisory board member for the Autism Research Institute (ARI) and the Open Medicine Foundation (OMF), a consultant for Stealth Biotherapeutics, and has submitted a technology disclosure to UCSD describing antipurinergic therapy for autism and related spectrum disorders. Acknowledgements RKN thanks Danielle Sternberg for creating the visualization of nucleotide metabolism and transport illustrated in Fig. 1. RKN thanks Mr. Dan Wright for his support of the MRL mouse studies on healing that created the foundation for the CDR hypothesis, and for the phone call one winter day in January 2008 that began a new trail of discovery in mitochondrial medicine and autism, and John Green, Steve Edelson, Nancy O 'Hara, Neil Nathan, and A. Taylor Bright for comments on the manuscript, and Richard Haas, Eric Gordon, Paul Hardy, Vicki Ko-bliner, Maya Shetreat-Klein, Mauro Lins, and RKN thanks the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation (UMDF) and NIH for a conference grant in 2010 that rst brought to- gether investigators to focus their interests on the crossroads of mi-tochondria and autism. RKN also thanks the Autism Research Institute (ARI) for their invitation to many high-level scienti c, medical, and family conferences, think tanks, and topical focus groups over the years.These events, the professional collaborations that they fostered, and many families and children a ected by autism around the world, have helped to re ne the concepts of the CDR, purinergic signaling, and new approaches to treatment discussed in this review.
