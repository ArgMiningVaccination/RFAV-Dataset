(2) In the light of the Commission's report on the experience gained,it has proved necessary to improve the operation of the author- isation procedures for the placing of medicinal products on the market in the Community and to amend certain administrativeaspects of the European Agency for the Evaluation ofMedicinal Products. In addition, the name of that Agencyshould be simplified and changed to the European MedicinesAgency, (hereinafter referred to as the 'Agency '). (3) It emerges from the conclusions of that report that the amendments to be made to the centralised procedure set up byRegulation (EEC) No 2309/93 consist of corrections to some ofthe operating procedures and adaptations to take account of theprobable development of science and technology and the futureenlargement of the European Union. It also emerges from the B2004R0726 \u2014EN\u201406.07.2009 \u2014004.001 \u20142 (1) OJ C 75 E, 26.3.2002, p. 189 and OJ C ...(not yet published in the Official Journal).

(4) Moreover, since the European Parliament and the Council haveadopted Directive 2001/83/EC of 6 November 2001 on theCommunity code relating to medicinal products for humanuse ( 1) and Directive 2001/82/EC of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products (2), all the references to the codified Directives in Regulation (EEC)No 2309/93 should be updated. (5) For the sake of clarity, it is necessary to replace the said Regu-lation with a new Regulation. (6) It is appropriate to preserve the Community mechanism set up by the repealed Community legislation for concertation prior to any national decision relating to a high-technology medicinal product. (7) Experience gained since the adoption of Council Directive87/22/EEC of 22 December 1986 on the approximation ofnational measures relating to the placing on the market of high-technology medicinal products, particularly those derived frombiotechnology ( 3) has shown that it is necessary to create a centralised authorisation procedure that is compulsory for high- technology medicinal products, particularly those resulting frombiotechnical processes, in order to maintain the high level ofscientific evaluation of these medicinal products in theEuropean Union and thus to preserve the confidence of patientsand the medical professions in the evaluation. This is particularlyimportant in the context of the emergence of new therapies, suchas gene therapy and associated cell therapies, and xenogenicsomatic therapy. This approach should be maintained, particularlywith a view to ensuring the effective operation of the internalmarket in the pharmaceutical sector. (8) With a view to harmonising the internal market for newmedicinal products, this procedure should also be madecompulsory for orphan medicinal products and any medicinalproduct for human use containing an entirely new activesubstance, i.e. one that has not yet been authorised in theCommunity, and for which the therapeutic indication is thetreatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, cancer,neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes. Four years after the dateof entry into force of this Regulation, the procedure should alsobecome compulsory for medicinal products for human usecontaining a new active substance, and for which the therapeuticindication is for the treatment of auto-immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. It should be possible to review the provisions in point 3 of the Annex via a simplifieddecision-making procedure not earlier than four years after theentry into force of this Regulation. (9) As regards medicinal products for human use, optional access tothe centralised procedure should also be provided for in caseswhere use of a single procedure produces added value for the patient. This procedure should remain optional for medicinal products which, although not belonging to the abovementionedcategories, are nevertheless therapeutically innovative. It is alsoappropriate to allow access to this procedure for medicinalproducts which, although not innovative, may be of benefit tosociety or to patients if they are authorised from the outset atCommunity level, such as certain medicinal products which can B2004R0726 \u2014EN\u201406.07.2009 \u2014004.001 \u20143 (1) OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 67.

Directive as amended by Council Directive 2004/28/EC (see p. 58 of this Official Journal). (3) OJ L 15, 17.1.1987, p. 38. Directive repealed by Directive 93/41/EEC (OJ L 214, 24.8.1993, p. 40).be supplied without a medical prescription. This option may be extended to generic medicinal products authorised by theCommunity, provided that this in no way undermines either theharmonisation achieved when the reference medicinal productwas evaluated or the results of that evaluation. (10) In the field of veterinary medicinal products, administrativemeasures should be laid down in order to take account of thespecific features of this field, particularly those due to theregional distribution of certain diseases. It should be possible touse the centralised procedure for the authorisation of veterinarymedicinal products used within the framework of Communityprovisions regarding prophylactic measures for epizooticdiseases. Optional access to the centralised procedure should bemaintained for veterinary medicinal products containing a newactive substance. (11) For medicinal products for human use, the period for protectionof data relating to pre-clinical tests and clinical trials should bethe same as that provided for in Directive 2001/83/EC. Formedicinal products for veterinary use, the period for protectionof data relating to pre-clinical tests and clinical trials as well assafety and residue tests should be the same as that provided for inDirective 2001/82/EC. (12) In order to reduce the cost for small and medium-sized enter-prises of marketing medicinal products authorised via thecentralised procedure, provisions should be adopted to allow fora reduction of fees, deferring the payment of fees, taking overresponsibility for translations and offering administrative assistance in respect of these enterprises. (13) In the interest of public health, authorisation decisions under the centralised procedure should be taken on the basis of theobjective scientific criteria of quality, safety and efficacy of themedicinal product concerned, to the exclusion of economic andother considerations. However, Member States should be ableexceptionally to prohibit the use in their territory of medicinalproducts for human use which infringe objectively definedconcepts of public policy and public morality. Moreover, aveterinary medicinal product is not to be authorised by theCommunity if its use would contravene the rules laid downwithin the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy or if presented for a use prohibited under other Community provisions, inter alia Directive 96/22/EC ( 1). (14) Provision should be made for the quality, safety and efficacycriteria in Directives 2001/83/EC and 2001/82/EC to apply tomedicinal products authorised by the Community and it shouldbe possible to assess the risk-benefit balance of all medicinalproducts when they are placed on the market, at the time ofthe renewal of the authorisation and at any other time thecompetent authority deems appropriate. (15) The Community is required, pursuant to Article 178 of theTreaty, to take account of the development policy aspects ofany measure and to promote the creation of conditions fit forhuman beings worldwide. Pharmaceutical law should continueto ensure that only efficacious, safe and top-quality medicinalproducts are exported, and the Commission should considercreating further incentives to carry out research into medicinalproducts against widespread tropical diseases. (16) There is also a need to provide for the ethical requirements ofDirective 2001/20/EC of 4 April 2001 of the European B2004R0726 \u2014EN\u201406.07.2009 \u2014004.001 \u20144 (1) Council Directive 96/22/EC of 29 April 1996 concerning the prohibition on the use in stockfarming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyrostaticaction and of -agonists (OJ L 125, 23.5.1996, p. 3).Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member Statesrelating to the implementation of good clinical practice in theconduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for humanuse ( 1) to apply to medicinal products authorised by the Community. In particular, with respect to clinical trialsconducted outside the Community on medicinal productsdestined to be authorised within the Community, at the time of the evaluation of the application for authorisation, it should be verified that these trials were conducted in accordance with theprinciples of good clinical practice and the ethical requirementsequivalent to the provisions of the said Directive. (17) The Community should have the means to carry out a scientificassessment of the medicinal products presented in accordancewith the decentralised Community authorisation procedures.Moreover, with a view to ensuring the effective harmonisationof administrative decisions taken by Member States with regardto medicinal products presented in accordance with decentralisedauthorisation procedures, it is necessary to endow the Communitywith the means to resolve disagreements between Member States concerning the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products. (18) The structure and operation of the various bodies making up the Agency should be designed in such a way as to take into accountthe need constantly to renew scientific expertise, the need forcooperation between Community and national bodies, the needfor adequate involvement of civil society, and the future enlar-gement of the European Union. The various bodies of the Agencyshould establish and develop appropriate contacts with the partiesconcerned, in particular representatives of patients and health-careprofessionals. (19) The chief task of the Agency should be to provide Communityinstitutions and Member States with the best possible scientificopinions so as to enable them to exercise the powers regardingthe authorisation and supervision of medicinal products conferredon them by Community legislation in the field of medicinalproducts. Only after a single scientific evaluation procedureaddressing the quality, safety and efficacy of high-technologymedicinal products has been conducted by the Agency,applying the highest possible standards, should marketing author-isation be granted by the Community, and this should be done bymeans of a rapid procedure ensuring close cooperation betweenthe Commission and Member States. (20) In order to ensure close cooperation between the Agency andscientists operating in Member States, the composition of theManagement Board should be such as to guarantee that thecompetent authorities of the Member States are closelyinvolved in the overall management of the Community systemfor authorising medicinal products. (21) The Agency's budget should be composed of fees paid by theprivate sector and contributions paid out of the Communitybudget to implement Community policies. (22) Paragraph 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999between the European Parliament, the Council and theCommission on budgetary discipline and improvement ofbudgetary procedure ( 2) provides for the Financial Perspective to be adjusted in order to cover the new needs resulting fromenlargement. (23) Exclusive responsibility for preparing the Agency's opinions onall questions concerning medicinal products for human use B2004R0726 \u2014EN\u201406.07.2009 \u2014004.001 \u20145 (1) OJ L 121, 1.5.2001, p. 34. (2) OJ C 172, 18.6.1999, p. 1.should be vested in a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. As far as veterinary medicinal products areconcerned, such responsibility should be vested in a Committeefor Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use. As regards orphanmedicinal products, the task should fall to the Committee onOrphan Medicinal Products set up under Regulation (EC)No 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products ( 1). Lastly, as regards herbal medicinal products, this responsibility should be vested in the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products set upunder Directive 2001/83/EC. (24) The creation of the Agency will make it possible to reinforce thescientific role and independence of the committees, particularlythrough the setting-up of a permanent technical and administra-tive secretariat. (25) The field of activity of the Scientific Committees should beenlarged and their operating methods and composition modernised. Scientific advice for future applicants seeking marketing authorisation should be provided more generally andin greater depth. Similarly, structures allowing the developmentof advice for companies, in particular small and medium-sizedenterprises, should be put in place. The committees should beable to delegate some of their evaluation duties to standingworking parties open to experts from the scientific worldappointed for this purpose, whilst retaining total responsibilityfor the scientific opinions issued. The re-examination proceduresshould be amended to provide a better guarantee for applicants'rights. (26) The number of members of the Scientific Committees partici-pating in the centralised procedure should be established with a view to ensuring that the committees remain of an efficient size after the enlargement of the European Union. (27) It is also necessary to reinforce the role of the ScientificCommittees in such a way as to enable the Agency to participateactively in international scientific dialogue and to develop certainactivities that will be necessary, in particular regarding interna-tional scientific harmonisation and technical cooperation with theWorld Health Organisation. (28) Furthermore, in order to create greater legal certainty it is necessary to define the responsibilities regarding the transparency rules for the Agency's work, to set certain conditions for themarketing of medicinal products authorised by the Community,to confer on the Agency powers to monitor the distribution ofmedicinal products authorised by the Community and to specifythe sanctions and the procedures for implementing them in theevent of failure to observe the provisions of this Regulation andthe conditions contained in the authorisations granted under theprocedures it establishes. (29) It is also necessary to take measures for the supervision ofmedicinal products authorised by the Community, and inparticular for the intensive supervision of undesirable effects ofthese medicinal products within the framework of Community pharmacovigilance activities, so as to ensure the rapid withdrawal from the market of any medicinal product presenting a negativerisk-benefit balance under normal conditions of use. (30) In order to enhance the efficiency of market surveillance, theAgency should be responsible for coordinating Member States'pharmacovigilance activities. A number of provisions need to beintroduced to put in place stringent and efficient pharmacov-igilance procedures, to allow the competent authority to take B2004R0726 \u2014EN\u201406.07.2009 \u2014004.001 \u20146 (1) OJ L 18, 22.1.2000, p. 1.provisional emergency measures, including the introduction of amendments to the marketing authorisation and, finally, topermit a reassessment to be made at any time of the risk-benefit balance of a medicinal product. (31) It is also appropriate to entrust the Commission, in close coop-eration with the Agency and after consultations with the MemberStates, with the task of coordinating the execution of the varioussupervisory responsibilities vested in the Member States, and inparticular with the tasks of providing information on medicinalproducts and of checking the observance of good manufacturing,laboratory and clinical practices. (32) It is necessary to provide for the coordinated implementation ofCommunity procedures for the authorisation of medicinalproducts, and of the national procedures of Member Stateswhich have already been harmonised to a considerable degreeby Directives 2001/83/EC and 2001/82/EC. It is appropriatethat the operation of the procedures laid down by this Regulationbe re-examined by the Commission every ten years on the basisof experience gained. (33) In order to meet, in particular, the legitimate expectations of patients and to take account of the increasingly rapid progress of science and therapies, accelerated assessment proceduresshould be set up, reserved for medicinal products of major ther-apeutic interest, and procedures for obtaining temporary author-isations subject to certain annually reviewable conditions. In thefield of medicinal products for human use, a common approachshould also be followed, whenever possible, regarding the criteriaand conditions for the compassionate use of new medicinalproducts under Member States' legislation. (34) Member States have developed an evaluation of the comparative efficacy of medicinal products aimed at positioning a new medicinal product with respect to those that already exist in thesame therapeutic class. Similarly, the Council, in its Conclusionson medicinal products and public health ( 1), adopted on 29 June 2000, emphasised the importance of identifying medicinalproducts that presented an added therapeutic value. Howeverthis evaluation should not be conducted in the context of themarketing authorisation, for which it is agreed that the funda-mental criteria should be retained. It is useful in this respect toallow for the possibility of gathering information on the methodsused by the Member States to determine the therapeutic benefitobtained by each new medicinal product. (35) In line with the current provisions of Directives 2001/83/EC and2001/82/EC, the term of validity of a Community marketingauthorisation should be limited initially to a period of fiveyears, upon the expiry of which it should be renewed. Thereafterthe marketing authorisation should normally be of unlimitedvalidity. Furthermore, any authorisation not used for three conse-cutive years, that is to say, one which has not led to the placingon the market of a medicinal product in the Community duringthat period, should be considered invalid, in order, in particular,to avoid the administrative burden of maintaining such authori-sations. However, this rule should be subject to exemptions whenthese are justified on public health grounds. (36) Environmental risks may arise from medicinal productscontaining or consisting of genetically modified organisms. It isthus necessary to subject such products to an environmental risk-assessment procedure similar to the procedure under Directive2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of B2004R0726 \u2014EN\u201406.07.2009 \u2014004.001 \u20147 (1) OJ C 218, 31.7.2000, p. 10.genetically modified organisms (1), to be conducted in parallel with the evaluation, under a single Community procedure, ofthe quality, safety and efficacy of the product concerned. (37) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulationshould be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on theCommission ( 2). (38) The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1647/2003 (3) amending Regulation (EC) No 2309/93 as regards the budgetary andfinancial rules applicable to the Agency and access to theAgency's documents should be fully incorporated into this Regu-lation, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: TITLE I DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE Article 1 The purpose of this Regulation is to lay down Community procedures for the authorisation, supervision and pharmacovigilance of medicinalproducts for human and veterinary use, and to establish a EuropeanMedicines Agency (hereinafter referred to as 'the Agency '). The provisions of this Regulation shall not affect the powers of Member States' authorities as regards setting the prices of medicinal products or their inclusion in the scope of the national health system or social security schemes on the basis of health, economic and social conditions.In particular, Member States shall be free to choose from the particularsshown in the marketing authorisation those therapeutic indications andpack sizes which will be covered by their social security bodies. Article 2 The definitions laid down in Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC and those laid down in Article 1 of Directive 2001/82/EC shall apply forthe purposes of this Regulation. The holder of a marketing authorisation for medicinal products covered by this Regulation must be established in the Community. The holdershall be responsible for the placing on the market of those medicinalproducts, whether he does it himself or via one or more personsdesignated to that effect. Article 3 1. No medicinal product appearing in the Annex may be placed on the market within the Community unless a marketing authorisation hasbeen granted by the Community in accordance with the provisions ofthis Regulation.

Any medicinal product not appearing in the Annex may be granted a marketing authorisation by the Community in accordance with theprovisions of this Regulation, if: (a) the medicinal product contains a new active substance which, on the date of entry into force of this Regulation, was not authorised in theCommunity; or (b) the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or thatthe granting of authorisation in accordance with this Regulation isin the interests of patients or animal health at Community level. Immunological veterinary medicinal products for the treatment of animal diseases that are subject to Community prophylactic measuresmay also be granted such authorisation. 3. A generic medicinal product of a reference medicinal product authorised by the Community may be authorised by the competentauthorities of the Member States in accordance with Directive2001/83/EC and Directive 2001/82/EC under the following conditions: (a) the application for authorisation is submitted in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC or Article 13 of Directive2001/82/EC; (b) the summary of the product characteristics is in all relevant respects consistent with that of the medicinal product authorised by theCommunity except for those parts of the summary of product char-acteristics referring to indications or dosage forms which were stillcovered by patent law at the time when the generic medicine wasmarketed; and (c) the generic medicinal product is authorised under the same name in all the Member States where the application has been made. For thepurposes of this provision, all the linguistic versions of the INN(international non-proprietary name) shall be considered to be thesame name. M3 4. After the competent committee of the Agency has been consulted, the Commission may adapt the Annex to technical and scientific progress and may adopt any necessary amendments without extendingthe scope of the centralised procedure. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 87(2a). B Article 4 1.

Without prejudice to Article 56 or to other tasks which Community law may confer on it, the Committee for MedicinalProducts for Human Use shall be responsible for drawing up theopinion of the Agency on any matter concerning the admissibility ofthe files submitted in accordance with the centralised procedure, the granting, variation, suspension or revocation of an authorisation to place a medicinal product for human use on the market in accordancewith the provisions of this Title, and pharmacovigilance. 3. At the request of the Executive Director of the Agency or the Commission representative, the Committee for Medicinal Products forHuman Use shall also draw up an opinion on any scientific matter concerning the evaluation of medicinal products for human use. The Committee shall take due account of any requests by Member States foran opinion. The Committee shall also formulate an opinion wheneverthere is disagreement in the evaluation of medicinal products throughthe mutual recognition procedure. The opinion of the Committee shallbe made publicly accessible. Article 6 1. Each application for the authorisation of a medicinal product for human use shall specifically and completely include the particulars anddocuments as referred to in Articles 8(3), 10, 10a, 10b or 11 of, andAnnex I to, Directive 2001/83/EC. The documents must include astatement to the effect that clinical trials carried out outside theEuropean Union meet the ethical requirements of Directive2001/20/EC. These particulars and documents shall take account ofthe unique, Community nature of the authorisation requested and,otherwise than in exceptional cases relating to the application of the law on trade marks, shall include the use of a single name for the medicinal product. The application shall be accompanied by the fee payable to the Agency for the examination of the application. 2. In the case of a medicinal product for human use containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms within the meaning ofArticle 2 of Directive 2001/18/EC, the application shall be accompaniedby: (a) a copy of the competent authorities' written consent to the deliberate release into the environment of the genetically modified organismsfor research and development purposes where provided for in Part Bof Directive 2001/18/EC or in Part B of Council Directive90/220/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the deliberate release into theenvironment of genetically modified organisms ( 1);B2004R0726 \u2014EN\u201406.07.2009 \u2014004.001 \u201410 (1) OJ L 117, 8.5.1990, p. 15.

The Agency shall ensure that the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use is given within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. The duration of the analysis of the scientific data in the file concerning the application for marketing authorisation must be at least 80 days,except in cases where the rapporteur and co-rapporteur declare that theyhave completed their assessment before that time. On the basis of a duly reasoned request, the said Committee may call for the duration of the analysis of the scientific data in the fileconcerning the application for marketing authorisation to be extended. In the case of a medicinal product for human use containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms, the opinion of the said Committee shall respect the environmental safety requirements laid down by Directive 2001/18/EC. During the process of evaluating appli-cations for marketing authorisations for medicinal products for humanuse containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms, therapporteur shall carry out necessary consultations of bodies that theCommunity or Member States have set up in accordance withDirective 2001/18/EC. 4. The Commission shall, in consultation with the Agency, Member States and interested parties, draw up a detailed guide regarding the form in which applications for authorisation are to be presented. Article 7 In order to prepare its opinion, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use: (a) shall verify that the particulars and documents submitted in accordance with Article 6 comply with the requirements ofDirective 2001/83/EC, and shall examine whether the conditionsspecified in this Regulation for granting a marketing authorisationare satisfied; (b) may request that an Official Medicines Control Laboratory or a laboratory that a Member State has designated for that purposetest the medicinal product for human use, its starting materialsand, if need be, its intermediate products or other constituentmaterials in order to ensure that the control methods employed bythe manufacturer and described in the application documents aresatisfactory; (c) may request that the applicant supplement the particulars accom- panying the application within a specific time period. Where thesaid Committee avails itself of this option, the time-limit laid downin Article 6(3), first subparagraph, shall be suspended until suchtime as the supplementary information requested has beenprovided. Likewise, this time-limit shall be suspended for the timeallowed for the applicant to prepare oral or written explanations. B2004R0726 \u2014EN\u201406.07.2009 \u2014004.001 \u201411Article 8 1.
