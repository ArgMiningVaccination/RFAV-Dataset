You don't have to be a science or math wiz to know that that's a lot of good for your health! Pharm-Aloe stands high above other aloe supplement brands because it's figured out the secret that gives this ancient succulent its well-deserved reputation as a miraculous medicinal plant. It all comes down to polysaccharides. Polysaccharides are a type of carbohydrate found in the solids of the aloe vera plant. Pharm-Aloe Aloe Vera Capsules offer this specific ingredient in concentrated forms so that you're getting more of it per dose, without having to drink gallons of liquid aloe vera juice! The aloe plant's less-beneficial components, such as the rind, aloe emodin, and anthraquinones (the stimulant-laxative components) get filtered out through a cold-processing technique otherwise known as a \"rising and falling\" film evaporator. This technique allows the solid concentrations to rise from 1.5% to 6% (a four-fold increase)! Aloe vera is oozing with a wide range of benefits suitable for people of all ages. Nutrient-dense and antioxidant-rich, it increases wellness in the following ways: - Boosts immune system strength and vitality* - Regulates stomach acidity* - Soothes digestion* - Supports absorption of other nutrients* - Improves joint function* - Promotes hydration* - Comforts exercise-related discomfort* - Aids in detoxification* - Encourages clear, healthy skin* Harvested in cultures worldwide for centuries, this fantastic \"medicine plant\" can be yours now in these convenient-to-take capsules! Pharm-Aloe Aloe Vera Capsules include a purity guarantee, and are packed with gut-and-health promoting vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and amino acids.
