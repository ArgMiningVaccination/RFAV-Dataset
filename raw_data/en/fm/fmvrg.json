The spiritual model of addiction states that a spiritual disconnection from a high power is what fuels addiction. Based on the spiritual model of addiction, individuals must establish and foster a deep relationship with a higher power, themselves, the people around them, and the world around them in order to combat their substance use. The spiritual model of addiction follows principles that are based on the belief that individuals are unable to overcome addiction on their own. Rather they need the support of a higher power of their choice, a community of others involved in recovery, and a spiritual awakening. What Is the Role of Spirituality in Addiction Treatment? Incorporating spirituality into substance use treatment helps increase the possibilities related to health and one's overall wellbeing. In substance use treatment spirituality differs from religious spirituality. Spirituality, in the context of addiction recovery, refers to an individual's personal connection with themselves and their surroundings. At Guardian Recovery Network, we offer [12-step mentorships](https://www.guardianrecoverynetwork.com/addiction-treatment/12-step-mentoring/) that focus on the 12-steps of recovery, which include spirituality.

Spirituality Offers Meaning & Purpose in Recovery If one does not feel as if they have meaning or purpose in their life, they may not feel the need to seek substance use treatment. Spirituality helps individuals develop a deeper meaning to their life. This can encourage an individual to find meaning, connection, and purpose in their life, which can help an individual stay motivated throughout the addiction recovery process. Spiritual Practices & Therapies in Spiritual Addiction Treatment There are different spiritual practices and therapies that are incorporated into substance use treatment. These spiritual practices are often combined with traditional substance use treatment practices. At Guardian Recovery Network, we utilize the following therapies to address the spiritual aspects of recovery: The Impact of Mindfulness & Meditation on Spiritual Growth [Mindfulness](https://www.guardianrecoverynetwork.com/addiction-treatment/addiction-therapy/mindfulness-and-meditation/) refers to the state of reaching mental awareness. Mindfulness helps individuals focus on the here and now, as opposed to overthinking about the past or worrying about the future. Mindfulness can help individuals slow down their negative thoughts, control impulsive reactions, and reconnect with their body. Mindfulness is used during the treatment of substance use disorders, and mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder. [Research](https://www.uclahealth.org/programs/marc/about-us/research) has found that mindfulness can help increase one's affect, concentration, and well-being. (4) Mindfulness and [meditation](https://www.guardianrecoverynetwork.com/addiction-treatment/addiction-therapy/mindfulness-and-meditation/) are two practices that are closely related. Meditation is a practice that helps focus and clear the mind through various techniques that have been utilized for centuries. There are different types of meditation techniques, such as mindfulness meditation, focused meditation, guided meditation, mantra meditation, and spiritual meditation. Our Drug's and Alcohol Treatment Services Include Incorporating Spiritual Principles in Twelve-Step Programs The 12-steps are guidelines utilized by various peer support groups including Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), and [Crystal Meth Anonymous](https://www.guardianrecoverynetwork.com/addiction-101/what-is-crystal-meth-anonymous/) (CMA). The 12-steps are spiritually based and are effective tools to help treat substance use disorder. [The 12-steps](https://www.guardianrecoverynetwork.com/addiction-treatment/12-step-recovery/step-12-carry-the-message-and-practice-the-principles/) incorporated into recovery include: - Honesty - This step focuses on accepting that substance use has become unmanageable and that a person is powerless over their addiction (as in, they have lost the ability to choose whether or not they continue drinking or using). - Hope - This step focuses on believing that a power greater than themselves can help them overcome their substance use (whatever that power may be). - Surrender - This step focuses on relinquishing control over to a higher power of one's understanding. - Courage - This step focuses on the individual coming to an understanding on how their substance use has impacted themselves and those around them. - Integrity - This step focuses on admitting to oneself, a higher power, and a trusted sponsor the exact nature of their decisions and indiscretions. - Willingness - This step focuses on accepting and allowing a higher power to remove character flaws and deficits that may contribute to the engagement of substance use. - Humility - This step focuses on humbly asking a higher power of one's choice to remove an individual's shortcomings. - Love - This step focuses on making a list of all the people who were harmed during an individual's substance use and seeing things from their perspective. - Responsibility - This step focuses on making amends with those who were affected by an individual's substance use, as long as it does not cause them any harm. - Discipline - This step focuses on admitting when one is wrong in order to maintain their treatment progress. - Awareness - This step focuses on discovering the plan that a higher power may have over one's life and moving forward. - Service - This step focuses on utilizing the principles discussed in the 12 steps throughout their lives and sharing the techniques with others experiencing substance use disorders. Connecting With a Higher Power or Higher Self in the Recovery Journey When incorporating spirituality into addiction recovery, one's connection to a higher power can help an individual connect and reach their high self. The connection to a higher power helps individuals learn to release their control on things and situations that they can not control. Connecting with a higher power can also provide those in recovery with peace and comfort. Utilizing techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, exercise, and journaling can help individuals make these important spiritual connections. Spirituality as a Source of Strength & Empowerment in Recovery Addiction recovery is not an easy process and it can take discipline, motivation, and resilience. Spirituality can be a source of strength for those working to overcome their substance use. As an individual begins to reach their treatment goals, they begin to develop confidence in their ability to maintain their sobriety long-term. Ready To Begin Your Drug's and Alcohol Treatment?
