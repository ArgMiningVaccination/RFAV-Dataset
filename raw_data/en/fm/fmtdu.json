Our comprehensive serum and saliva tests measure different types of hormones such as estrogen, growth hormone, testosterone and thyroid function and we perform detailed analysis of the major organs of the body including gastro-intestinal health and autoimmune diseases. Book An Appointment We Will Contact You with an Available Appointment. Gut Health & Inflammation Gut bacteria not only influences the digestion of food but also mood, sleep patterns, hormones and weight management. Gut disorders, such as constipation and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or gut dysbiosis, can greatly impact the GI tract and GI motility. Fortifying the walls of the intestinal tract are critical not only for proper digestion and absorption, but also for over-all health and staving off auto-immune gut diseases and hormone dysregulation. Gut bacteria homeostasis is also critical for digestion and absorption. At Rehab-X, we use both allopathic and functional medicine therapies to repair and restore balance and health in the gut. Hormone Balancing At Wellness MedX, we specialize in balancing hormones to improve physiological function which greatly promotes optimal health. Our comprehensive serum and saliva tests measure different types of hormones such as estrogen, growth hormone, vitamin D and thyroid function. After test results are provided, our medical team provides a thorough analysis to the patient including a path towards healing and cellular efficiency. Whether in menopause or experiencing other effects of hormone in-balance (such as low testosterone), our focus is always to provide our patients with the best allopathic and functional medicine therapies to promote hormone balance and optimal health. Nutrition & Weight Management Poor nutritional choices greatly impact cellular heath and bring about diseases. A comprehensive meal plan comprised of plant based, ketogenic, intermittent fasting and paleo choices, but dictated by daily activity, truly defines functional nutrition. At Wellness MedX we are committed to fighting the obesity epidemic by providing our patients with the best allopathic and functional medicine therapies to help manage weight. We conduct a complete hormone panel, including metabolic panel and thyroid function, in order to understand the physiological state of the patient. Our medical team then consults with the patient to design a customized treatment plan (fitness and functional nutrition) to help meet the patient's weight management goals. "}
