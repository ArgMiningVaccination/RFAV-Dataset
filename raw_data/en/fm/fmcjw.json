Addressing the underlying Mechanism of Cause and educating you on how you can eliminate your allergies, the shots and the medications, along with the life restriction is vital for your current and future health. When you are ready to address your allergies and their underlying cause, Dr. Huntoon has the understanding and experience to support you through that process. To Request an Action Plan to Address Your Allergies with Natural Allergy Solution [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) It is always important to understand the Mechanism of a problem, so you can address the real Cause, and then prevent the problem once and for all. And this is the real purpose for this article. This is one of the most common questions I hear in my office. And it has been for greater than the past 27 years. This is why I went to learn two different allergy techniques to help address them. The first is called Nambudripad Allergy Elimination Technique, (NAET) and the second is called Total Body Modification (TBM) NAET was the first technique I learned and was very effective, but involved a person staying away from their specific allergen for a period of 24 hours. Many times this was too inconvenient, so I continued to research for a better solution and was introduced to TBM. This method is quite effective and when the person's been properly prepared, I can use this technique to eliminate an allergen within about 30 seconds. Then the person can then go right back to their lifestyle without any avoidance period. This has made treatment much more user-friendly for the practice member. To understand why you get allergies, one must first understand the Mechanism for them. Allergies result from incomplete breakdown of whole proteins, followed by the absorption of those whole proteins into the bloodstream. Under normal digestion, these whole proteins should be broken down into their basic building blocks known as amino acids, before being absorbed into the bloodstream. The amino acids are then delivered to the Liver for the assignment of repairing and rebuilding within the body. So What Would Cause a Person to Begin Having Allergies? There exists a common condition among allergy sufferers were there is an imbalance within the digestive system as a result of, among other things, [antibiotic therapy](antibioticsandyou1.asp). I mention this specifically because it is so common in this country, and it is something everyone must understand, especially if you have progressed to the point of having allergies. What occurs within the body as a result of antibiotic therapy is a loss of healthy digestive bacteria, and the basis for an overgrowth of [digestive Yeast/Candida](yeast-candidia.asp), two normal fungi that also assist in the digestive process. This condition is known as [Leaky Gut Syndrome](leakygutsyndrome.asp) and is a bi-product of antibiotic treatment and the use of over-the-counter and prescription medications, chlorinated water, fluoride, bromine in all baked products, food additives, preservatives, [GMO foods](gmo-geneticallymodifiedorganisms.asp), alcohol, etc. This leads to problems in our [microbiome](themicrobiotaandyourmicrobiome.asp). How Does One Know If They Suffer From This Imbalance? One may notice an increase [craving for sugar](whyamiaddictedtosugar2.asp), along with the symptoms of intestinal gas and bloating. This is an indication that the overgrowth of [Yeast and Candida](yeast-candidia.asp) has taken place. As a consequence, complete digestion can not take place, and it results in incomplete protein breakdown. When the proteins fail to fully break down, they will then cross the digestive system wall, aka [Leaky Gut Syndrome](leakygutsyndrome.asp) and enter into the bloodstream. This should never take place. The Immune System, which is designed to attack foreign invaders that enter the bloodstream, including whole proteins, will now attack these undigested proteins.The Immune response then generates the release of histamine from the cells, which most have come to know as the [Allergy Reaction](allergies.asp). Once a person has this imbalance, and the Immune System continues to attack these undigested proteins, the Immune System will begin to have trouble rebuilding its immune cells. This is because the cells are formed from the amino acid building blocks that the digestive system is not delivering due to the incomplete protein digestion. As a consequence, the [Immune System](child-immune-system-health.asp) begins to fail, and the person finds themselves getting sick all the time. Another component to this complex imbalance within the body results from the ingestion of dairy and cheese. By eating these foods in conjunction to having the overgrowth of yeast and candida will result in the body producing excess amounts of mucus. If this mucus develops in the intestinal system, stagnant digestion known as [constipation](constipation.asp) results. If it affects the respiratory system, asthma, airborne allergies and sinus congestion results. If the mucus then traps infection, it can lead to sinus infections or lung infections. And the treatment for this would be the antibiotic therapy. Unfortunately, if you have understood what you have read here, you will realize that the antibiotic therapy created much of this imbalance to begin with. As a result, by continuing to repeat the process, without restoring normal balance, you will never get out of the cycle. The medical approach to allergies is two-fold. Avoidance and Allergy shots. Avoidance of an allergen, especially if it is so pervasive in your normal, daily environment is not a good solution. This will naturally lead to getting allergy shots. The theory of allergy shots is to give the body a shot of the reduced allergen, in an effort to stimulate the immune system to develop a proper response when exposed to an allergen. This is very time consuming and requires many visits over months and years. And some people need to get \"allergy shots\" for the rest of their life. This in itself does not seem like a real solution. [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You Consider clicking on the next section \"What Can I Do For My Allergies?\" The most important thing you can do is work to improve the functioning of your Digestive System. The Best way to address this is to work with a [Holistic Chiropractor](holistic-chiropractor.asp), like Dr. Huntoon , who has done this with his practice members for the past 30 years. There is a very specific [4 step process](leakygutsyndromerepair.asp) you will need to go through under the supervision of Dr. Huntoon or another holistic practitioner. Until this returns to normal, your Immune System will continue to attack the undigested proteins from your diet, and you will continue to have allergies. While this process of improving your digestion is occurring, it would benefit you to avoid certain foods within your diet. These include: The reason for these limits is because each of them goes to feeding the problem. Until the elimination occurs, you will continue to have allergies. In the meantime, there are several natural remedies designed to help assist in eliminating the symptoms of allergies. Each are designed to support the natural response to the allergic reaction within the body.
