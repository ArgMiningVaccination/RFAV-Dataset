Over the summer, hundreds of individuals raised nearly $1 million in one week to save the laboratory site of Nikola Tesla, the late physicist and engineer whose work in the late 1800s and early 1900s formed the foundation for wireless and X-ray technology. The funds are to be used to purchase the land where Tesla worked and to build a museum in his honor. The initiative taken by donors to keep a scientific legend's work alive is quite moving. New legendary scientists are being discovered every day. In mid-September, I was lucky to be able to attend the PhRMA Research & Hope Awards ceremony in Washington, DC, where nine individuals were honored for their work in the fight against Alzheimer's disease, a disease that is not only plaguing healthcare systems and distressing caregivers worldwide, but that also presents complex scientific challenges. Also in September, 10 major biopharmaceutical companies formed TransCelerate BioPharma, a nonprofit aimed at accelerating the development of new medicines, with an initial focus on clinical trial execution. This month, I will be meeting the recipients of the AAPS Graduate Student, Innovation, and Research Achievement awards in Chicago. The recipients of the awards are dedicating their studies to improving pharma analysis, formulation design, drug delivery, product perfor- mance, and more. All of the individuals working to identify new disease diagnostics and therapeutics, whether or not they are recognized on the global stage, serve as the backbone to this industry. For without new products to manufacture, where would we be? Just where R&D lies in America's future may very well depend on federal spending and support. With the US presidential election around the corner, I thought it impor- tant to examine where the country's candidates stand on this issue. Here are a few goals from Obama's court based on the FY2013 presidential budget proposal, which calls for $140.8 billion in overall federal R&D spending, an increase of $2 billion over Romney's official website includes his plan for American jobs and economic growth. The 160-page document includes language on R&D and basic research, but that language largely focuses on clean energy spending and technologies. The core policy sections of Romney's plan\u2014tax, regulation, trade, energy, labor, human capital, and fiscal management\u2014do not include medical research or science policy PUIFS \u0001UIBO\u0001GSPN \u0001BO\u0001FEVDBUJPOBM \u0001TUBOEQPJOU \u0001BOE\u0001NZ\u0001FNBJM \u0001SFRVFTU\u0001UP\u0001UIF\u00013PNOF Z\u0001 campaign team about his take on NIH and FDA spending was not answered. Media reports from earlier this year note that Romney would like to shrink the NIH bio- medical budget, but it's important to note that, as governor of Massachusetts, he did support the state's biotech industry. It will be interesting to see how the winning candidate's goals are carried out given that Congress largely controls the final federal budget.

It is important that scientists and researchers establish these relationships within big and small pharma, academia, government, and professional organizations, such as the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS), to help keep the industry moving forward. But, as with any relationship, there are bound to be challenges. Managing partnerships with CROs, for example, is a necessity for many in the pharmaceutical sector. Pharma companies have a broad strategic rationale for clini- cal outsourcing and are still experimenting with different CRO relationship models. According to an April 2012 report from Booz & Company, \"Nimble Partnerships in the Pharma Industry,\" there are four types of relationship models emerging: Qualified Talent Supplier, Preferred Capacity Partner, Preferred Capability Partner, and Strategic Partner. To develop sustainable value from these relationships, companies must align the design, structure, and performance measures of their relationships with their strategy. Companies that adopt a quick, capability-centered approach to partnerships are likely to be more focused, make better use of their distinct capabilities, and gener- ate more value. Much of consulting is about one's network. Partnerships with other consultants can broaden a consultant's network, provide more opportunities, and allow one to assemble a \"complete package\" for a given project. For example, if approached by a cli- ent to complete a clinical trial, I might design the trial, write the protocol, analyze the data, and write the report. But I need a partner to run and monitor the trial, complete the bioanalytical assays, possibly prepare regulatory documents, and provide a medi- cal opinion on the safety aspects of the trial. By partnering with the right group of consultants, I can put together a \"virtual project team\" to complete the study with expertise in every required area. In recent years, industry has also taken a more collaborative approach with aca- demic research institutions. Academia holds a strong role in the advancement of drug discovery and has created great partnering relationships with companies. Tightening federal budgets have put a strain on academic laboratories, and the industry is try- ing to cut costs and improve productivity by outsourcing. This environment allows for the increased opportunity for collaboration from both parties and an increased acceleration in drug discovery. AAPS recognizes the importance of partnerships in our field. During the past few years, the association has partnered and cosponsored events with numerous orga-nizations, including FIP, FDA, ACCP, ASCPT, and GBC. In addition, the association continues to partner with its members to bring them the information, both scientific and for professional development, they need. One area of focus during my presidency has been on the changing nature of our membership. Last year, AAPS created a Big Pharma /Small Pharma Task Force to identify the unique needs of the members from smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, CROs, and consultants, and to determine how AAPS could adapt to meet their changing needs. The task force pre-sented recommendations to ensure that members who are part of small pharma and biotech companies do not feel overshadowed by those employed in Big Pharma. These recommendations are particularly important to AAPS; nearly 50 % of our members now reside at a small pharma /biotech company, CRO, or as a consultant. One recom- mendation was to allocate programming at this year's annual meeting (taking place Oct. 14-18 in Chicago ) geared specifically towards members working at small com- panies, which has been completed. Additionally, we have learned that there is a need for more programming on discovery, a primary activity of small pharma, biotech, and academia. Lastly, we're organizing a summit of key pharmaceutical leaders to discuss the progression of the industry over the next 20 years. Our goal is to identify what industry, government, and academia need to be successful and how AAPS can help. zDavid Mitchell, PhD, is president of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS).Pierre Turtaut/Getty ImagesNanoparticles for Targeted Delivery Recently published research demonstrates how nanoparticles can be used to overcome hurdles in localized drug delivery. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University designed nanoparticles that could be used to deliver drugs locally in the brain, which may help overcome issues of access and toxicity when administering chemotherapeutics directly to the brain after surgical removal of tumors (1). Generally, particles larger than 64 nm do not freely diffuse through the extracellular space in the brain. To overcome the barrier to diffusion, researchers coated plastic nanoparticles with polyethelyne glycol (PEG) to reduce surface adhesiveness. When applied to slices of rat or human brain, the PEG-coated nanoparticles diffused farther than untreated particles, and diffusion of particles as large as 114 nm was observed. In mouse brain in vivo , the authors demonstrated diffusion of 85 nm, biodegradable, PEG-coated particles loaded with the anticancer agent paxlitaxol. Researchers from the University of Georgia used an FDA-approved biodegradable polymer to create nanoparticles targeted to the mitochondria (2). Dysfunctional mitochondria have been implicated in conditions including cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration, but targeting a therapeutic to a subcellular organelle is difficult. To achieve selective targeting, the authors screened a library of particles with different sizes and charges to select those with optimal uptake into mitochondria, then administered drug-loaded particles to cultured cells. For the anticancer drug lonidamine, they found that mitochondrial targeting increased cell-killing by more than 100 times compared with the drug alone and by five times compared with nanoparticles targeting the outside of the cell. Both studies show how modifying nanoparticle physicochemical properties can solve specific problems in targeted delivery. Sources: 1. Nance et al., Sci. Transl. Med . Acad. Sci. online, doi: \u2014 Amy RitterReport from India Swiss-based Novartis is taking India to court in a bid to seek patent protection of its leukaemia drug, Glivec (known as Gleevec in US). Novartis first applied for the patent in 2006 but was denied. In similar instances, Swiss-based Roche's anticancer drug Tarceva and US-based Gilead Sciences' HIV medicine Viread have failed to secure patent protection in India. Looking back, patent laws in India have come a long way. India's patent history began in 1856 with Act VI, which encouraged innovations and sharing of creations between inventors. Based on the British Patent Law of 1852, Act VI was in effect for 30 years. When the British government amended the laws in 1800s, India followed suit. In 1911, the Indian Patents and Design Acts came into effect whereby a Controller was installed to manage patent-related issues. When India gained independence from Great Britian, the Patent Act of 1970 was introduced to spur innovation and economic growth. It abolished the product patent system based on the \"Ayyangar Committee Report, 1959,\" which examined the factors influencing the high pric es of the drugs and pharmaceuticals in India. The Patent Act has been revised three times since then and made compliant with the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement in 2005. India has since enforced a set of strict patent laws, and foreign players are facing obstacles in the review process, patent tracking, and pregrant and postgrant opposition, says Ajaykumar Sharma, associate director, pharma and biotech, healthcare practice of Frost and Sullivan (South Asia and Middle East). The interpretation of different sections of the Patent Act of 2005 and review of application remain the biggest challenge. This challenge is increased by the lack of trained manpower that further delays the review process. The Indian Patent Office, additionally, does not have an efficient database system to facilitate searchable full text databases of all patents and applications. Foreign players continue to face an increase in pregrant and postgrant opposition by generic-drug companies. Litigation and infringement cases usually take longer to resolve. India has enforced stricter patent laws compared to other countries such as South Africa. For a drug to be patentable in India, the invention has to be novel (i.e., new to the industry), inventive, and industrially applicable. In contrast, weak patent standards and the absence of a patent agency in South Africa have resulted in the granting of a high number of patents yearly. In 2008 alone, South Africa issued a total of 2442 patents. The Indian patent agency has set a higher bar for patent approval that is frustrating pharmaceutical manufacturers who are deeply concerned over the agency's standpoint of intellectual property in the country. In Novartis' case, the company is challenging the efficacy clause stated in Section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Law. However, the Indian agency views its decision as a move to curb the \"evergreening\" practice, whereby a drug is tweaked slightly in a bid to extend patent protection. Specifically, the Novartis patent application was denied on the grounds that the drug lacks innovation because it is considered a salt formulation of the drug and not a new drug altogether. Discovery Pipeline October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 11Global News If Novartis gets its way with the patent, the decision could result in a flood of new patent applications and possibly threaten patients' access to essential drugs tagged at affordable prices. More significantly, it may upset India's position as a generic-drug manufacturer and role to provide affordable drugs to other developing countries. The Indian Patent Law has also made provisions for the Controller of Patents to issue compulsory licenses to deal with extreme or emergency situations. Recently, the Controller gave approval to Natco Pharma to produce the generic version of Nexavar. As a result, Natco is able to price the drug at $158 for a 120-tablet package. Despite the concerted efforts to provide low-cost drugs, the problem of poor medical access is still prevalent in the country. To date, a significant number of infants (aged 12 to 23 months) have yet to be fully vaccinated against six major childhood diseases (tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio and measles) even though the Indian government has made these primary vaccination programs free across the country. Tapan J. Ray, director-general of the Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, an association of R&D pharmaceutical companies in India, says: \"Only a short focus on the rejuvenation of the fragile healthcare delivery system, healthcare financing, and rapid development of healthcare infrastructure by the government or public private partnership will address the access issue.\" It is also impractical to envisage that the granting of compulsory license will resolve the issue of access to patented medicines on a long-term basis. Granting of these licenses should only be done after exhausting all access improvement measures, Ray says.Sharma adds, \"Compulsory license should not be a benchmark for possible future decisions taken by the government. But I foresee a need and evolution of a new business model that will reach out to the masses by foreign players. This can take place possibly in the forms of differential price launches, patient assistance programs, or state medical purchase policies.\" Asked whether it is possible to strike a balance between maximizing profits and providing patient access to drugs, Sharma comments that this can be achieved through differential pricing. For example, GlaxoSmithKline's Ventolin asthma inhaler is priced at the lowest level possible for the lowest-income patients, Flixotide at a lower discount for those with higher incomes, and Diskus priced highest for citizens with the highest incomes. Roche is working on details to offer discounted versions of two cancer drugs, Herceptin and MabThera, in India by early next year. Given the current restricted parameters, foreign companies should start looking for innovative engagement models to operate on Indian soil, Sharma says. In fact, mergers and acquisitions have taken place between foreign and Indian firms. In 2010, Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories' acquisition of Mumbai-based Piramal Healthcare for $3.7 billion has brought its market share in India to approximately 7%, and the company is expecting revenues to grow an estimated 20% a year to more than $2.5 billion by 2020, propelling the company to the leading position in the Indian market. In January 2011, Bayer Healthcare has inked a joint venture agreement with Mumbai-based Zydus Cadila in a bid to enhance its presence in India. \u2014 Jane Wan is a freelance writer based in Singapore The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has abolished its Cell-based Product Working Party (CPWP) and Gene Therapy Working Party (GTWP), with the aim of improving efficiencies and optimising the use of available expertise. Instead, EMA's Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) will be assuming the lead role in all aspects concerning the development of advanced-therapy medicines in Europe, including developing guidelines, organizing workshops and establishing ad-hoc draft groups as and when required to develop specific guidance documents. Guidance documents already being developed by CPWP or GTWP will be taken over by the new drafting groups. According to a statement from EMA, the move will strengthen the role of CAT as Europe's reference body for advanced-therapy medicines. The agency also thanked the members of CPWP and GTWP for their work over the past few years.When establishing draft groups, approximately five experts will be drawn from CAT's members and the European expert list. However, the current members of CPWP and GTWP will remain on the consultation list. CPWP and GTWP both existed prior to the establishment of CAT in 2009, and originally belonged to EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The parties were transferred once CAT initiated operational activities. \u2014 Stephanie Sutton Follow us on Twitter@BioPharmIntl Join us on LinkedIn/BioPharm InternationalEMA Streamlines Working Parties 12 International October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 13Regulatory Beat Digital Vision/Getty Images The promise of the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 (GDUFA ) is to end multiyear reviews of new generic drugs and the ever-growing queue of pending applica-tions. After years of resistance, generic-drug makers agreed last year to provide funds to FDA to support speedier approval of abbreviated new drug appli-cations (ANDAs ) and prior approval supplements (PASs), as well as timely inspection of domestic and foreign manufacturers and suppliers of APIs. To launch the new fee program on Oct. 1, 2012, FDA issued a wave of Federal Register notices and guidance documents in August 2012 that officially inform manufacturers of relevant pro-cedures and obligations. The various fees autho-rized by GDUFA will provide $299 million in funding for FDA in fiscal year 2013 and $1.5 billion over five years. Application fees of approx-imately $50,000 will add up to almost $100 mil-lion, primarily from payments on an expected 750 to 900 ANDAs each year, plus some 750 sup-plements. Approximately $15 million will be lev-ied on newly referenced (type II ) drug master files (DMFs) on a one-time basis according to a fairly complex process; an FDA Q&A guidance spells out specifics on this and other issues and how fees will be calculated (1). IDENTIFYING FACILITIES Approximately $175 million in fees will be levied annually on facilities operated by manufacturers of both finished dos-age forms (FDFs) and API producers, the majority (approximately $140 million ) collected for FDFs. The payments will be $15,000-$30,000 higher for foreign facilities to reflect added inspection costs, and plants that produce both fin-ished drugs and APIs will pay both fees. One tricky issue is how to account for facilities with several buildings at one site. Such complexes may owe only one fee if FDA determines that the site can be inspected at one time, based on activities and ownership structure. But one company with several distinct facilities most likely will pay fees for each location. This manufacturer \"self identification\" pro- gram expects to collect information from 3000 or so organizations, facilities, and sites utilizing existing electronic data submission processes and familiar file formats to reduce the data col-lection burden on the agency and industry (2). Manufacturers will provide Data Universal Numbering System numbers and Facility Establishment Identifiers plus physical addresses and contact details. Various producers have to re gis t er wi th FD A, bu t d o n o t ha v e t o pa y f ees , including repackagers, manufacturers of positron emission tomography drugs, and sites conduct-ing bioequivalence or bioavailability studies and other analytical testing. In addition to determining who has to ante up, FDA expects the facility identification pro-gram will provide important information to pro-mote global supply chain transparency. The data will go into new generic-drug facility databases, which will provide information to help FDA address global supply chain issues. Among other stated goals, FDA will conduct biennial GMP surveillance inspections of generic API produc-ers and product manufacturers, with the aim to achieve parity in inspection frequency between foreign and domestic firms in 2017. CUTTING THE BACKLOG FDA's Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) also will collect a one-time ANDA backlog fee this year on pending ANDAs, which will generate an expected $50 million to support the processing of almost 3000 ANDAs currently in the applica-tion queue. Many of these applications are cat-egorized as \"incomplete\" or were hit with \"not New Era for Generic Drugs User fees aim to speed approvals and support timely plant inspections. Jill Wechsler is BioPharm International's Washington editor, Chevy Chase, MD, Hot-Topic Roundup Tablet-splitting challenges FDA officials are struggling to set standards for drugs that are scored to faci l itate spl itti ng by consumers, a practice that has become increasingly common as a way to reduce prescription drug costs. Ideally, the two halves of a split tablet would be identical, but there are no standards for ensuring that result. FDA issued draft guidance in August 2011 proposing criteria for evalu- ating and labeling scored brand and generic products. The United States Pharmacopeia also is examining th e issue for a General Chapter on uniformity of dosage un its. At issue is whether scoring yields consistent split doses and how to evaluate the stability and friability of the splits. The agency sought advice on the recommendations in its draft guidance at the August 2012 meeting of the Advisory Committee for Pharmaceutical Science and Clinical Pharmacology. Key topics discussed were how to assess ease of splitting, loss of mass, and variations in weight as an indication of content uniformity. Also on the agenda was whether to apply standards just to new products and to permit existing scored drugs to remain as is. The advisors agreed that a test for content uniformity should not involve tablet splitting by patients, as that would inject too much variability into the evaluation process. But there were questions about the value of stability data on split products and the status of marketed scored drugs. FDA is, therefore, headed back to the drawing board to clarify scoring and splitting test proposals. Opportunities with orphan drugs Pharmaceutical manufacturers are eyeing the orphan-drug market as a source of growth, as revenues and profits for widely used medicines fail to keep pace with new cancer therapies and other critical treatments for small patient populations. Despite limited markets, orphans accounted for $50 billion in global sales for 2011, according to an August report by Thomson Reuters . These select therapies benefit from extended exclusivity that can delay generic competition, as well as speedy FDA approvals based on smaller clinical trials. The analysts expect growth to continue for new orphan drugs, as well as expanded indications for initial therapies. Fast track safety? Despite pressure on FDA from patient groups and industry to moderate testing requirements and accelerate reviews of new drugs, particularly therapies for se riously ill patients, critics con- tinue to \"priority review,\" and \"acceler- approval\" policies permit harmful products to reach the mar- ket. The latest entry to the debate comes from Thomas Moore of the Institute for Safe Medicine Practice and Curt Furburg, profes- sor at Wake Forest School of Medicine, who identify safety issues for three drugs recently approved under expeditious approaches. Their analysis in the Sept. 5 Journal of the American Medical Association cites one therapy for seriously ill cancer patients, which carries a limited distribution program. Another drug aims to prevent multiple sclerosis relapse and is subject to tight postmar- keting review. More problematic is the blood thinner Pradaxa for stroke prevention, which has experienced serious adverse events since it was approved in 2010. The remedy, according to Moore and Furburg, is longer clini- cal trials and extensive analysis to ensure that benefits outweigh risks of new therapies. Their conclusion contradicts efforts in Congress to expand expedited review for breakthrough drugs. And it runs counter to a main theme of the new FDA user-fee legislation (PDUFA IV), which calls on the agency to acknowledge patients' willingness to accept risk with new therapies. More data on drug samples FDA is implementing a new prog ram that requires pharmaceuti- cal manufacturers to submit data on drug sample distribution, a provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 that aims to increase transparency in industry interactions with doctors and prescribers. Data submission offi cial ly began on Apr . 1 , 201 2, but FDA did not issue guidance on how to submit data until Apr. 3, 2012 and, thus, said it would not enforce the requirements until Oct. 1, 2012. Under the new program, drugmakers have to file data that identify distributed samples and recipient phy- sicians every April 1 st for activities during the previous year, using the FDA Electronic Submissions Gateway and the XML data scheme. The ACA program overlaps to some extent with policies set by the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which requires manufacturers to maintain records of all samples distributed by sales representatives to licensed practitioners. For PDMA, how- ever, companies do not submit the data to FDA, but hold it for three years. The aim is to track theft or illegal diversion of drugs and to prevent adulterated medici nes from reaching consumers, explained John Oroho of Porzio LifeSciences at CBI's Forum on Aggregate Spend in August 2012. The ACA program aims to iden- tify which drug samples are going to specific healthcare profes- sionals, similar to \"Sunshine\" provisions elsewhere in the health reform legislation that focus on disclosing which doctors receive payments and gifts from the pharmaceutical industry. The PDMA and ACA programs are expected to \"mesh seam- lessly,\" according to FDA officials, but manufacturers are skepti- cal. Complicating the picture is a new drug sample disclosure program in Vermont that went into effect April 1. Definitions and data submission requirements di ffer for Vermont, the ACA trans- parency program, and PDMA. For example, Vermont specifies that manufacturers do not have to submit data on drugs provided for clinical trials or research, but there is no similar caveat under the ACA policy. Just what FDA or Vermont will do with this information remains to be seen. October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 15Regulatory Beat approvable\" or \"complete response\" letters years ago, but were not with-drawn by the manufacturer. The initiative aims to clear out 90 % of the ANDAs and amendments in the backlog by 2017. FDA would like to whittle down the backlog before launching the GDUFA backlog program and announced in June that it plans to cancel backlogged applications that have not involved any communica-tion with the sponsor since 1991. An August Federal Register notice further encourages manufacturers to withdraw backlogged applica-tions that they no longer wish to pursue (3). The agency calculated that if 2000 applications remain in the backlog (of the 3000 pending in August ), the backlog fee would be $25,000 per application. FDA also promises to meet a range of GDUFA performance goals out-lined in a commitment letter to manufacturers that is structured sim-ilar ly t o programs tha t ha v e been in place for brand drugs for 20 years (4). Under a phased-in approach, FDA will \"review and act on\" 60 % of ANDA submissions within 15 months by the third year of the pro-gram; the timeframe tightens in year five to review of 90 % of submissions within 10 months. ANDA evaluation will take longer if a manufacturer files major amendments during the review process, and OGD will not accept an ANDA until the applica- tion fee is paid, a situation that could be important in determining which generic firm is \"first to file.\" OGD will strive to clarify review decisions by issuing complete response letters and DMF \"complete- ness assessments,\" instituting roll-ing reviews, and holding first cycle deficiency meetings with sponsors. If minor problems crop up during a review, OGD staff will try to inform sponsors of \"easily correctable defi- ciencies\" that can be remedied quickly. OGD reviewers expect that issues raised in complete response letters will be addressed initially through teleconferences with the agency; eventually GDUFA will pro-vide time and resources for spon-sors to meet with OGD reviewers in person to discuss specific complete response letter issues. Sponsors still may file applica- tions on paper, but FDA does not have to meet user-fee performance goals unless the ANDA is filed electronically, a process that FDA expects will become universal in the near future. FDA would like to see continued improvement in the quality of applications to reduce the frequent back-and-forth question-ing that routinely delays approvals. OGD has been encouraging makers to adopt quality-by-design (QbD) a pp roa ch es by issuing sample pharmaceutical development reports with QbD principles for both immediate-release and modi-fied-release solid oral dosage forms. The agency recently updated its Question-Based Review system to incorporate QbD models and has tightened initial criteria for filing ANDAs to discourage incomplete submissions. OGD has established a central system to track the progress and status of each application as it moves through the review process, and a broader OGD quality manage-ment system aims to clearly docu-ment procedures to provide more consistency across review divisions. Some of the GDUFA revenues also will support development of fur-ther guidance and research to facili-tate development of more complex generic products, such as anti-epi-leptic drugs and inhaled products. FDA held a public meeting in September to review with manufac-turers these and other program imple-mentation issues. GDUFA policies also were a prime topic at the PDA / FDA Joint Regulatory Conference on September 11, 2012 in Baltimore and at the fall technical conference on Oct. 2 -3 sponsored by the Generic Pharmaceutical Association. Implementing GDUFA will involve a significant expansion in OGD staff on all levels, along with extensive training for new hires and expanded IT systems. To provide the broader management structure needed to oversee this more com-plex generic drug program, CD ER director Janet Woodcock recently announced plans to elevate OGD to a \"super office\" with other offices reporting to it. Instead of being part of CDER's Office of Pharmaceutical Science (OPS), OGD will be a par- allel umbrella organization, simi-lar to CD ER's Office of New Drugs and Office of Compliance. New OGD director Greg Geba will head the super OGD, reporting directly to Woodcock and better posi-tioned to work with CD ER's Office of Executive Programs on GDUFA implementation. The larger plan is to replace OPS with a new Office of Pharmaceutical Quality (OP Q), which will be responsible for overseeing drug quality throughout the product life-cycle. The new OP Q will absorb cer- tain OPS functions as well as some activities performed by the Office of Manufacturing and Product Quality in the Office of Compliance. And, w h en w e w en t t o p ress , th ere was considerable anxiety that Congress would fail to enact an FDA appro-priations bill by Oct. 1, which is needed for the agency to collect any 2013 user fees. Hopefully, that impass will be remedied by the time you read this report. REFERENCES 1.

Pharm-Source gets that question morethan any other. Published estimates of market size vary widely and often seem to be exaggerated or inflated. MEASURING THE MARKET Determining the size of the contract-manu-facturing market is a methodological chal-lenge. The biggest obstacle is the fact that most CMOs are either privately owned and do not report their financial results or are part o f larg er co rpo ra ti o ns tha t usuall y d o not break out their CMO revenues in their financial reports. Although good research can overcome some of these problems, deter-mining mar k et s ize en ds u p req uiring so m e amount of \"guesstimation.\" Another methodological problem is defin- ing what is included as \"contract manufac-turing.\" Many published reports are unclear about what they are measuring, which can lead to widely divergent market-size esti-mates. Understanding a given market size estimate requires that the reader and user fully appreciate what is being measured. Some of the dimensions that must be consid-ered are discussed below:t\u0001\u0001Which products are included in the market? The definition can include prescription products, over-the-counter (OTC), and nutritional products. Although prescription and OTC prod-ucts are both governed by drug GMPs, nutritional prod-ucts often are not, so the mar-ket dynamics and participants tend to be different, albeit with some overlap.t\u0001Is the product being manufactured propri- etary to the client or is it generic? Some estimates of the contract-manufacturing market appear to include generic APIs, which are really commodities that can be bought by any company looking to manu-facture a generic or OTC drug. There also are generic or OTC drug products that the manufacturer licenses to a customer to be packaged under the customer's name, the so-called \"private label\" business. By contrast, pure contract manufacturing involves a CMO manufacturing an API or drug product using the client's proprietary process or proprietary formulation. t\u0001What regulatory standards must be met? Many manufacturers in emerging markets offer contract manufacturing, but they do not operate under North American, Western European, or Japanese regulatory standards. These companies are compet- ing in a different market and under a different set of terms than manufacturers that meet higher regulatory requirements. Given the potentially broad dimensions of the CMO industry, users of market-size data must be clear about the applicability of the data they are using. PharmSource recently published its own estimate of the size of the dose CMO market, Dose CMOs by the Numbers\u20142012 Edition. We measured the market for contract manufacturing of a cli-The contract-dose manufacturing market in 2011 was $13.7 billion.Sizing the Market for Contract Manufacturing Measuring the size of the market for contract- manufacturing services requires a careful hand. Jim Miller is president of PharmSource Information Services, Inc., and publisher of Bio/Pharmaceutical Outsourcing Report, tel. 703.383.4903, Twitter@ 17Perspectives on Outsourcing ent's formulation under FDA, Western European, or Japanese GMP standards and built our estimate based on extensive research of company revenues and revenue modeling. We (PharmSource ) arrived at a contract-dose manufacturing mar-ket size of $13.7 billion in 2011. That was up 7 % from 2010, but that growth rate includes revenue from facilities that became con-tract-manufacturing sites during the year after they were acquired by CMOs from biopharmaceuti-cal/pharmaceutical companies. The organic growth rate (i.e., the gr o wth o f re v en u es a t f a cili ti es that were in CMO networks in 2010) was 6 %. We estimate that overall, dose CMOs accounted for 22% of the biopharmaceutical / pharmaceutical industry's dose-related cost-of-goods in 2011. Of course, size and growth are not the only dimensions that matter for the health of the industry. Contract-dose manu-facturing suffers from overca-pacity, especially for solid-dose forms, and the intense competi-ti o n t o sell ca pa ci ty m eans tha t only a minority of dose CMOs make reasonable profits. Further, global biopharmaceutical /phar- maceutical companies continue to show a strong preference for building captive manufacturing, shutting CMOs out from some of the most attractive segments of the market. We continue to believe that a consolidation of the industry will happen sooner rather than later, driven by developments in the broader economic and financial environment. When that hap-pens, the industry may not be so big or growing at the same rate, but it will be getting healthier.GETTING PAID A recent analysis of working capital management practices of biopharmaceutical /pharmaceuti- cal companies has some mixed implications for the contract-services industry. The report from financial services giant Citi claims that the global bio-pharmaceutical /pharmaceutical companies could release $33 bil-lion in cash by managing their working capital better. Working capital is the difference between current assets (which include accounts receivable and inven-tories ) and current liabilities (which include accounts payable and short-term debt ). Companies use cash when they build up inventories and receivables and pay their bills; they increase their cash when they run down their inventories, slow payments to suppliers, or collect receivables more aggressively. Companies could free up that cash by reducing inventories and taking longer to pay their bills, according to the Citi report. The additional cash resources could be used for licensing and acquisi-tion deals or could be returned to shareholders as dividends and stock buybacks. Having to wait longer for their money is not something that CMOs and CROs want to hear. Service providers are already g etting sq u eezed o n p ri ces an d profit margins, and a slowdown in payments will eat further into their profits by forcing them to borrow more against their lin es o f credi t o r t o f o re g o dis-counts they might get from pay-ing their own suppliers. In the worst cases, CROs and CMOs could be forced to delay hir-ing or purchasing materials and equipment, which would hurt the quality and reliability of the services they provide. On the other hand, helping their biopharmaceutical /pharma- ceutical clients to reduce their inventories could be a big oppor-tunity for CMOs. Managing inventories is about managing production schedules, cycle times, and supply chains. These are skill sets at which CMOs are supposed to excel because they are at the core of modern manu-facturing practice. CMOs that are able to reduce schedule lock-in times from the traditional three months for dose forms and six to twelve months for APIs could increase their share of business from key customers and probably earn somewhat higher margins. The working-capital challenge raised by the Citi report is further proof that success for CMOs will go beyond traditional measures of quality and cost of goods. Contract-dose manufacturing suffers from overcapacity, and the intense competition to sell capacity means that only a minority of dose CMOs make reasonable profits.18 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com October 2012Burrill on Biotech Digital Vision/Getty ImagesIt has n ' t been an easy tim e f o r lif e-sci en ces companies seeking to go public. Companies have had to wait patiently to find market opportunities and often have had to lower their expectations about how investors value their companies. Despite the challenges, drugmakers that have gone public in recent years are beat -ing both the general market and other initial public offerings (IPOs) overall. Therapeutics companies that have gone public since 2011 are up 27.1 % as of the end of August 2012, outperforming the average 8.6 % return for US IPOs during that time and beating both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (up 13.1 %) and the Nasdaq Composite Average (up 15.6 %) for the same period. The performance of these IPOs may come as a surprise given the difficult envi-ronment companies in the sector have faced for completing offerings. The performance of therapeutics IPOs has been bolstered by a handful of companies, led by the 159.4 % rise through the end of August 2012 in shares of Pacira Pharmaceuticals from its public market debut in February 2011, and the 145.6 % rise in shares of Supernus Pharmaceuticals from its April 2012 IPO during that same period. Pacira has been rising since its April 2012 launch of Expareo, a nonopiate, postsurgical pain killer. Supernus, a specialty pharma-ceutical company focused on central nervous system disorders, has risen on news of tentative FDA approval of Trokendi XR, its once-daily extended-release formulation of the anticonvulsant topiramate. In both cases, fundamental developments drove stock per-formance as these companies advanced towards new product revenue. The lesson here is that Wall Street will respond posi-tively to the sector when a company makes progress to justify it. But these IPOs share another notable feature. Pacira and Supernus both took significant cuts to the target price of their offerings and raised considerably less than they had set out to raise. Pacira sold its shares at 53.3 % below its initial target and Supernus sold its shares at 61.5 % below its tar- get. Overall, both companies downsized their offerings, each raising about 38 % less than they had initially set out to raise. The cut in target price that companies have been willing to take to get their deals done has been one indicator of performance. As a group, th e IPOs tha t cam e in a t 5 0 % o r m o re bel o w their target range were the best performing group, while those deals that sold above their target range were the worst performing group. Since 2010, the four life-sciences IPOs that priced above their expected range are down 50.3% w hil e 1 1 issu es tha t cam e wi thin th eir target range are down 46.5 %. By contrast, the 1 1 issu es tha t ini tiall y so l d a t 5 0 % or more below their target range are up 20.7 %. When all life-sciences IPOs since 2010 are con- sidered, the picture grows grimmer.

Tha t figure co m pares wi th an average increase for all US IPOs of 9.4% during the same period. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (up 25.5 %) and the Nasdaq Composite Index (up 35.1%) trounced the performance of the IPO group. Life-sciences companies that went public in 2010 have dragged on the overall performance of the life-sciences IPOs, with companies that went public that year down 47.6 %. Industrial and agricultural bio- t e c h I P O s h a v e b e e n t h e w o r s t performers, with a 55.6 % decline for all deals since 2010. Amyris, which is using synthetic biology to develop alternatives to petro-leum-based specialty chemicals and transportation fuels, was one of the worst performers among the industrial and agricultural biotech companies, falling 80.5 %. The company pulled back production plans and shifted its strategy in February 2012 after it acknowl-edged difficulty in scaling its tech-nology up to commercial scale. Tools and technology compa- ni es ha v e also been hard hi t. As a group, the four companies in this sector that completed IPOs since 2010 are down an average of 45.3 %. The next-generation sequencing companies Complete Genomics (down 66.2 %) and Pacific Biosciences (down 87.7 %) were among the worst performing life-sciences companies as both faced difficulties building demand for their products. IPOs continue to be scaled back and are coming to market at a modest pace. Overall, the amount of money raised in IPOs through the first eight months of 2012 is d o wn fr o m a y ear a g o . Thr o u gh August 2012, a total of 12 life-sciences companies completed IPOs on US exchanges to raise a total of $871 million. That is a 21.6% drop from the $1.1 billion raised in 13 IPOs during the same period a year ago. The drop is even sharper globally as life-sciences IPOs around the world raised just $1.8 billion through the first eight m o n ths o f 20 1 2 in 25 IPOs. Tha t number represents a 48 % drop from the $3.4 billion raised glob-ally in 35 offerings during this same period a year ago. Certainly, one thing that has helped improve the performance and outlook for IPOs has been improved stability in the market. Table I: Initial public offering (IPO) performance by sector.

Medical device maker Globus Medical was the sole life-sciences IPO to be completed in August 2012 on a US exchange. The com-pany raised $99.6 million by sell-ing 8.3 million shares at $12 each. The offering came in below the company's target range of $16 to $18, but it also represented scaled-back plans for the company, which originally expected to sell 11.8 mil-li o n s hares wi th an ey e t o rais ing twice the amount it actually did. The backlog of deals in the queue is growing. There are 20 life-sciences companies in regis-tration as of the end of the end of August 2012. That compares with just 13 at the same time a year ago. Nine companies have withdrawn their IPOs so far this year. The market is more receptive to therapeutics companies right now, as long as those companies are realistic about their values. However, the five industrial bio-tech companies in registration face a hard road to going public until the ability to commercial- ize these technologies is better established and investors warm to their prospects. At the end of August, Elevance Renewable Sciences withdrew its planned IPO and announced it had instead raised $104 million series E round with two private equity firms.

This month, Anne Marie Dixon of Cleanroom Management Associates, gives us an update on her 1988 article, \"Clean Room Management.\" Cleanrooms have evolved since 1988 because of the advances in science and technology. These innovations have ben- efitted consumers worldwide. New products, medical advancements, space exploration, travel, computers, and communications all have one major common denominator\u2014better living through cleanroom technology. STANDARDS In 1992, at the instigation of the Institute of Environmental Sciences and Technology, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI ) petitioned the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to cre- ate the Cleanrooms and Associated Controlled Environments technical committee, formally established in May 1993. The mission of this committee was to develop an interna-tional standard for cleanrooms and associ-ated controlled environments encompassing standardization of equipment, facilities, and operational methods. In accordance with ISO procedures, the work would be performed in \" w o r king gr o u ps. \" On No v em ber 29 , 200 1 , ISO 14644-1 and 14644-2, officially replaced US Federal Standard 209 Airborne Particulate Cleanliness Classes in Cleanrooms and Clean Zones. This change was necessary because until the formation of TC 209, each country had its own standard, which differed from Federal Standard 209. The difference was con-fusing for companies with multiple plants worldwide. Federal Standard 209 also had lim-itations on particle classifications and size ranges. ISO /TC 209 pull ed t o g eth er th e bes t of all of the existing standards into one set of standards that could be applied to all clean-rooms, irrespective of product or process. The ISO /TC 209 working groups addressed additional areas of interest beyond Federal S t a n d a r d 2 0 9 , s u c h a s T e s t m e t h o d s (ISO 14644-3 ), Design, Start-up and Construction (ISO 14644-4 Bio- contamination (ISO 14698-1,2 ), Classification of Air Cleanliness by Chemical Concentration (ISO 14644-8 ), and Classification of Surface Particle Cleanliness (ISO 14644-9 ). In 2009, ISO /TC 209 work began under a new scope that would specify the minimum requirements for classification, design, and operations of nanotechnology facilities as they differ from cleanrooms described in the exist-ing other ISO /TC 209 documents. A com- mittee draft was published in 2012 and the working group is anticipating the publication of the first document, Classification of Air Cleanliness by Nanoscale Particle Concentration as a DIS (Draft International Standard) in early 2013. OPERATIONS Cleanroom costs for design and construction have greatly increased o v er th e pas t 25 y ears. Materials of construc-tion have improved and designers are more aware of the need for surfaces that can be cleaned and withstand View the 1988 article, \"Clean Room Management,\" by Anne Marie Dixon, at BioPharmInternational. International 23Retrospective: Cleanrooms aggressive disinfectants. However, degradation and the aging pro-cess are major concerns of the cleanroom user community. The internal surfaces of the clean-rooms and the H VAC system have become a major issue in older facilities. Ductwork wear and damage, surface finishes, electri-cal systems, computer systems are some of the areas that are affected by sporicidal agents that are used routinely in the sanitization process. Environmental monitoring limits have changed\u2014many reg-ulators have lowered the limit standards. Some of today's clean-rooms were designed when the limits for air viable and surfaces were much higher. These changes to standards have resulted in additional cleaning (drowning ) of the facility with disinfectants and sporicidal agents. The cost of operations (i.e., utilities, supplies, salaries, sup-port staff, security ) has increased dramatically over the past 25 years. Today, companies must take into consideration the process, product, regulatory or customer requirements, risk, and quality requirements when designing a facility. The focus should be on \"clean air\" over the product and not create a \"clean the world\" facility. Designs are changing to include closed systems, separa- tive devices, robotics, continu- ous monitoring, controls, and an understanding of contamination control. The final cleanroom lay- out and design should support the product and process. PERSONNEL TRAINING Personnel working in a cleanroom environment require specific train- ing. As an example, if the subject was aseptic gowning, the under- standing of the risk during gown- ing and the cross-contamination to the product, process, and /or patient is important. Since 1988, limit for the allowable colony forming units (CFUs) per plate in qualifications has decreased dramatically. Common train-ing in 1988 included brief train-ing, practice, and qualification. Understanding the sequence of gowning and the techniques for performing gowning are crucial. Training for aseptic gowning must allow for the student to observe the complexities; therefore, the student must perform gowning to become proficient. The training must allow the students to prac-tice. Today, practice requires time. Electronic or e Learning was becoming popular in 1988, but some facilities lost interest because of an inability to main-tain a current program. Many companies did not invest in the time or personnel required to maintain these programs. Some firms have e Learning available but only on a limited basis. The technical support for e Learning is GMP and standard operating procedures (SOPs). Federal regula- tions do not necessarily change dramatically every year, but hun-dreds of SOPs do change annu-ally, making change control and management of any e Learning program difficult. SOP training is performed every day in every cleanroom and con-trolled environment in all indus-tries. The \"read and understand\" method of SOP training requires employees to read and sign a training form stating that they understand the information. For some SOPs, this may be sufficient. But for other SOPs, this may not be successful. Some SOPs must be taught and explained. Others will require a demonstration of the task to be performed. One exam-ple of this type of SOP would be for the admittance of items into an airlock or pass-thru. How do you sanitize? How do you remove a layer of wrap or bag? How do you unload a cart? How do you clean the cart? The admittance of items is the second largest source of contamination for any clean-room or controlled environment, yet little time is spent in training on the proper transfer techniques. Operator turnover is a way of life in many facilities. In 1988, there were many plants that had employees with tenure. Today, many companies are using tem-porary staffing because of the high benefit package for employ-ees. This environment creates a challenge for the training staff. New employees may arrive on site monthly or, in some plants, weekly. Trainers must be available to handle the basic GMP courses, cleanroom courses, gowning, and the extensive number of SOPs. THE FUTURE OF CLEANROOMS What is the cleanroom of the future? The world of nanotech-nology will lead us into the next evolution of cleanrooms and con-trolled environments. The design and operations of cleanrooms and the types of products to be manu-factured are far more extensive than anyone could have imagined in 1988. The biopharmaceutical industry is rapidly growing, devel-oping new products for future generations. The cost of operations (i.e., utilities, supplies, salaries, support staff, security) has increased dramatically over the past 25 years. 24 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com October 2012Outsourcing Achieving a good return on assets through manufacturing capacity utilization is an on- going challenge for biophar- maceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies need manufacturing capacity on hand to produce com-mercial products and also to launch new products as they come through their drug-development pipelines. The inherent uncertainty of drug devel-opment, however, makes it difficult to balance the need for timely access to manufacturing capacity with the interest of avoiding underutilizing capacity and a resulting reduction on a return on assets. This balancing act is particularly challenging with biologics manufacturing because the capital costs for manufacturing capac-ity are higher than traditional small- molecule drug-substance manufactur-ing. A long-term manufacturing capac-ity-sharing arrangement by Merck & Co. and MedImmune LLC, the bio- logics arm of Astra Zeneca, established in September 2011, demonstrates a potential solution for the capacity challenges increasingly being faced by biopharmaceutical companies. CHANGING FUNDAMENTALS FOR BIOLOGICS MANUFACTURING The impetus for the companies' manu- facturing capacity-sharing agreement reflected larger trends in biopharma-ceutical manufacturing. In the 1990s, many large pharmaceutical companies began building biologics manufactur-ing capacity in anticipation of advanc- ing biologic-based drug candidates. At the same time, certain CMOs began to emerge to fill capacity requirements. As these changes occurred, during the 2000s, technology gains also started to significantly improve upstream yields, explained Michael Kamarck, then president of Merck Bio Ventures, who spoke at the Drug, Chemical, and Associated Technologies Association (DCAT) Business Development Forum, Successfully Partnering Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Throughout Product Lifecycle , which was held in mid- March 2012 in New York Proprietary fermentation technology, for exam-p l e , i m p r o v e d y i e l d s a t t h e b e g i n -ning of the decade from 0.5 to 1 g /L to 1-3 g /L in 2002, to 3-5 g/L in 2004 to 10 g /L in 2007. The confluence of increased manufactur-ing capacity that resulted from both improved technology and recently constructed greenfield biologic-based manufacturing facilities resulted in overcapacity on an industry level. \"This evolution brought us to another chapter in biomanufactur-ing,\" said Kamarck, pointing to strate-gic collaborations as a way to manage the capacity overflow and biomanu-facturing needs.

All rights reserved. 10/12 PATH0242R1 Visit at AAPS October 2012Outsourcing ing capacity-sharing arrange- ment made by Merck and MedImmune in September 2011. In 2007, Astra Zeneca completed the acquisition of MedImmune, which became the biologics arm of Astra Zeneca, incorporating the MedImmune assets, legacy AstraZeneca biologics assets, and Cambridge Antibody Technology, which Astra Zeneca had acquired in 2006. A key manufacturing asset for MedImmune, which is headquartered in Gaithersburg, Maryland, is the company's large-scale monoclonal antibody (mAb) manufacturing facility in Frederick, Maryland. Prior to its acquisition by Astra Zeneca, in 2005, MedImmune committed to support 500 kg of production per year through the addition of two 15,000- L bioreactors, which would replace an original 2 x 2500 L plant. The additional capacity was intended to meet the mid-range product demand of MedImmune through 2013. In acquiring MedImmune in 2007, AstraZeneca further authorized an additional 500 kg of capac-ity to include a total of four 15,000- L bioreactor trains at the new Frederick facility. When the MedImmune prod- uct for which the initial capac- ity was intended did not proceed through clinical development, MedImmune realized that existing products would not fill the site. The combination of a pipeline- delivery gap and the subsequent improvement in titres or grams- per-liter yields required an alterna- tive solution to fill capacity. \"This became the genesis of the concept for sharing capacity or selling it directly,\" explained Andrew D. Skibo, executive vice-president of operations at MedImmune, who also spoke at the DCAT Business Development F o r u m . T h e b u s i n e s s c a s e f o r developing an alternative approach to utilizing capacity was clear, he said. Contrary to the original plan, the plant would not be fully utilized by MedImmune's own pipeline until at least 2022 based on a three- to five-year delay in product commercialization and dramatically improved titres. In addition to the underutiliza-tion of the facility, the associated staff at the facility would be in standby status. \"The skilled and trained staff was the highest value asset of concern,\" said Skibo. \"We wanted to retain key employees by get-ting them working in their area of expertise.\" With the motivation of cover- ing operating expenses of staff and depreciation for the manu-facturing assets, which was esti-mated at $100 million per year, the business case for developing a partnership for sharing capacity was made. In evaluating a poten-tial partner, Skibo outlined that certain criteria came into play. The ideal situation would involve one or two partners with large-volume needs specific to need-ing capacity for mammalian cell culture (i.e., Chinese hamster ovary). The arrangement would require joint capacity planning in a long-term deal (i.e., 10 to 15 years ). In an arrangement, MedImmune capacity needs would prevail, and reciprocity with capacity in other areas, such as microbial bulk capacity, high-capacity mAb filling, and live-virus filling would also be part of any agreement. \"This criteria would preclude a strictly CMO-type agreement from working,\" explained Skibo. \"This type of arrangement would require the right people and peo-ple ' chemistry . ' It is more than a financial agreement; both parties would have 'skin in the game,'\" he said. EVALUATING THE DEAL Using those criteria, MedImmune selected Merck & Co. as its partner. The companies formed a 15-year manufacturing capacity-sharing agreement in September 2011 with Merck utilizing MedImmune's Frederick, Maryland, facility for Merck bulk product manufac-turing. The companies also are exploring the suitability of Merck's facilities in the production of microbial-based compounds in MedImmune's pipeline, and other potential manufacturing oppor-tunities where business strategies intersect. Manufacturing began in the fourth quarter of 2011. The arrangement provides benefits to both parties. For MedImmune, the arrangement provides long-range utilization of excess capacity at the company's Frederick facility while maintaining sufficient capacity for MedImmune's own products. For Merck, the arrangement provides flexible and rapid access to capac-ity for the company's maturing biologics pipeline, which includes biosimilar candidates. Skibo points out that the deal represents a new model in phar-maceutical manufacturing, one based on \"co-opetition,\" a mind- set that contains both coopera- tion and competition (1). A key consideration of a \"co-opetition\" model is that the players in the g a m e o f b u s i n e s s i n c l u d e c u s -tomers, suppliers, competitors as well as those that provide com-plementary rather than compet-ing products and services. In the case of Merck and MedImmune, although both companies provide pharmaceutical products, there is n o direct co m peti ti o n in th e service being shared, namely bio-logics manufacturing capacity. The deal is structured to provide MedImmune and Merck a bal-ance of lot cost versus production risk allocation that in combina-tion is uniquely different than a October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 27Outsourcing typical CMO arrangement. Lot cost is based upon MedImmune' s own internal fully absorbed lot production costs. The risk associ-ated with lot production reflects a traditional CMO assignment of risk. Merck pays for any addi-tional specialized resources and / or capital expansion upgrades as needed. The initial focus is on cell-based compounds for which Merck develops the process and analytics through medium scale, so any future changes are limited to fit and manufacturing needs only. MedImmune can provide large-scale technology transfer out of the Frederick facility as needed and can decline to work on any specific project. LOOKING AHEAD Since Merck and MedImmune announced their manufacturing-capacity arrangement, several other companies have partnered in biosimilars in a co-opetition-like or strategic partnership model. In February 2012, Biogen Idec and Samsung formed a joint venture, Samsung Bioepis to develop, manufacture, and mar-ket biosimilars in keeping with their agreement announced in December 2011. Under the agree-ment, Samsung is contributing $255 million of the $300 mil-lion for an 85 % stake, and Biogen Idec is contributing $45 million for a 15 % stake in the joint ven- ture. The joint venture, which will be based in Korea, will contract with Biogen Idec and Samsung Biologics for technical development and manufactur-ing services. Samsung Biologics is a Samsung business formed in April 2011 to specialize in bio-pharmaceutical manufacturing. The joint venture will not pursue biosimilars of Biogen Idec's pro-prietary products. Amgen and Watson Pharma- ceuticals formed a collaboration i n D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 1 t o d e v e l o p and commercialize, on a world-wide basis, several oncology antibody biosimilars. Under the agreement, Amgen will assume primary responsibility for devel-oping, manufacturing, and initially commercializing the oncology antibody products. W a t s o n w i l l c o n t r i b u t e u p t o $400 million in codevelopment costs over the course of develop-ment, including the provision of development support, and will share product-development risks. In addition, Watson will contribute its expertise in the commercialization and market-ing of products in specialty and generic-drug markets. The col-laboration products are expected to be sold under a joint Amgen / Watson label. Watson will ini-tially receive royalties and sales milestones from product reve-nues. The collaboration will not pursue biosimilars of Amgen's proprietary products. Baxter and Momenta Pharma- ceuticals also formed a col-l a b o r a t i o n i n D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 1 , to develop and commercialize biosimilars. Baxter will provide its clinical-development and biologic manufacturing exper-tise while Momenta will provide its expertise in high-resolution analytics, characterization, and product and process develop-ment. Looking ahead, Skibo observed, \"Partnering to min-imize investment risk will become commonplace in the future. It easier to justify a $600 million to $800 million invest-ment when there is more than one pipeline to support, in addi-tion to in-licensing, biosimilars, and novel products.\" REFERENCE 1. A.

For these reasons, worldwide regula-tory agencies require that biotechnological products produced in cell substrates be tested to ensure the absence of mycoplasma contamination. The challenge with mycoplasma testing is that current procedures are time consuming, requiring a 28-day duration. However, this time requirement is not ame-nable for obtaining the rapid lot release testing results needed for biopharmaceutical products that have short half-lives or those that are in high market demand. The lengthy assay period is also not conducive to the rapid screening of raw materials intended for use in future production, nor to the rapid in-process screen-ing of intermediates for the purpose of detecting and containing contamination events. Eurofins Lancaster Laboratories now offers a rapid mycoplasma test comparable in sensitivity to the 28-day compendial method. Instrumentation To execute this rapid technology, Eurofins Lancaster Laboratories uses EMD Millipore's MilliPROBE \u00ae Real Time Detection System for Mycoplasma.

Stability Testing and Storage Method Development & ValidationFinal Product Release TestingRaw Materials Testing Residual & Impurities TestingFacility & Process ValidationMicrobiology BiochemistryViral Clearance & Viral For a CMO, vaccine manufacturing requires the capability to produce a diverse set of products at different scales for multiple clients. BioPharm International spoke with Marco Chacon, president and C EO of Paragon Bioservices, about the challenges associated with out-sourced vaccine manufacturing. Paragon Bioservices is a midsized CMO with exper-tise in vaccine manufacturing, including the production of of virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines. BioPharm: What are Paragon's capabilities with regards to vaccines? Chac\u00f3n: The types of vaccines we pro- duce can be viral or bacterial antigens of o n e so rt o r an o th er . As l o ng as th ey are recombinantly produced, the nature of the protein doesn't matter. We can do both nonclinical and GMP manufacturing in several systems, including bacterial, yeast, mammalian, and insect cells at volumes up to 500 L in mammalian or insect cells, and up to 300 L for microbial systems. Ov er th e pas t sev eral y ears , w e ha v e pu t together a number of capabilities. We have found that in addition to having the right manufacturing tools, one also has to have the right analytics, and at the tail end, the quality teams such that the material is pro-duced while observing all the regulations. BioPharm: Are there any challenges that differentiate vaccine manufacture from the manufacture of other classes of proteins? Chac\u00f3n: If the vaccine that you're pro- ducing falls into the category of recombi-nant protein expression, such as VLP-type vaccines, the only challenge is to assemble those particles correctly and purify them. On the whole, a company that is capable of doing recombinant protein expression and purification ought to be able to do the same with VLP-type vaccines. The difference is more significant when you're making whole-cell or whole-virus vaccines, when the safety classification of the organisms must be considered. A company may have [biosafety level] BS L 2 capabilities, but not BS L 3. BioPharm: T o w ha t ext en t d o y o u use quality-by-design (QbD) principles in your processes? Chac\u00f3n: QbD is something newer to us, but it's something that we have embraced, and we're building more systems so that we can execute our projects and deliver on that level. We have recently been awarded a large government contract, and the sponsoring agency requires that we adopt QbD principles in the execution of this contract. BioPharm: When comparing clients with whom you have previously done develop-ment work versus those that come to you just for manufacturing, is there a differ-ence in how you approach technology transfer /process development under the two circumstances? Chac\u00f3n: For those projects in which we ha v e been wi th th e cli en t fr o m making research-grade vaccine targets, by the time it goes to the GMP suite we know that pro-cess inside and out. But it doesn't mean we can't work well with a reasonably sophis-ticated client that reaches out to us at a later stage, let's just say, right before they wan t t o man ufa cture , o r mak e a t o xi co l -o gy l o t. W e ha v e req uirem en ts in p la ce that compel that client to provide us with all pertinent information, thus making the tech transfer process the best it can be. We will characterize any original reagents, cell banks, and the like according to the requirements put in place by our Quality unit, and there there should be no signifi-cant problems. Considerations in Outsourced Vaccine Manufacturing Moderated by Amy Ritter A Q&A with Marco Chac\u00f3n, PhD, president and CEO of Paragon Bioservices. Marco Chac\u00f3n, president and CEO of Paragon Bioservices October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 31Special Section: Vaccines Occasionally, we may get a project that is grossly undefined, or where the expectation of the client may be a bit too unrealistic. But as long as w e ha v e req uirem en ts tha t w e s ti ck by in terms of accepting a project, more often than not those problems can be avoided. BioPharm: Given the diversity of forms for vaccines (i.e., VLPs, viruses, protein antigens ), what strategies do you have for ensuring your facility can meet the demands of such var-ied production requirements? Chac\u00f3n: We can work with a vari- ety of systems with relative ease, and this has to do with how our GMP services were started. We were in the business of providing preclinical servi ces f o r aro un d 1 7 o r 1 8 y ears. We developed a number of skills and capabilities at smaller scale and with different reagent grades to produce recombinant proteins, VLPs, and dif- ferent viral vectors including adeno-virus, and lentivirus. We had to build those capabilities, and add the ana-lytics required to oversee a process and characterize the final product. When we added GMP manufactur-ing, it was a very logical extension of those preclinical services. We went ahead and built in the versatility to support a variety of services. Technology changes, and we need to embrace that. The challenge is o n us , t o l oo k t o th e fu ture an d anticipate those changes to remain at the cutting edge and be of great- est help and assistance to our cli-ents. We need to be mindful of how the marketplace changes, because to be successful at growing a company you need to be sure that your offer-ings are in tune with such demands. Today, the large pharmaceutical companies that used to do every- thing on their own send out many projects including vaccine produc-tion services. In fact, it goes across the whole panorama of needs, from preclinical targets, to vaccine can-didates, to GMP manufacturing for clinical trials. By keeping a keen eye as to where those demands are com-ing from, what type of technologies the marketplace is asking us to pro-vide, we need to be swift and nimble and move with the times. On the manufacturing side, I think the adoption of new technol-ogy is critical. The past 10 years or so, certainly in mammalian and insect cell expression, we've seen a shift to the use of single-use disposables. With single-use disposables you can do mammalian or insect runs u p t o 2000 L in a single run, although we only go up to 500 L. Disposables cut down on cost, because cleaning pro-tocols are extremely reduced or not necessary for many aspects of the manufacturing process. 4701 Southport Supply Rd., SE, Suite 7 Southport, 910-454-9442 \u0001\u0001%\u0001\u0001\u0012ax: 910-454-9443 Trust The Experts Cygnus Technologies has the solution for testing HCP in vaccine products . ,\u0001A54 ,\u0001 Custom development services for MDC K II cell line In addition to HCP ELISA kits, our new DNA extraction kits reduce labor, and increase throughput with more accurate results.

Glenn Thorpe, vice-president of strategic mar- ket development, syringe systems, at West Pharmaceutical Services., gave an update to BioPharm International on trends in these areas. BioPharm: What would you identify as key developments in vaccine delivery systems? Thorpe: The mix of primary con- tainers used for vaccines has changed over the past decade. The predominant use of multi-dose vials has been partly affected by the removal of Thimerosal as a preservative and affected also by moves to unit dose packaging in sin-gle-dose vials and prefillable syringes. Prefillable syringe use has expanded greatly as vaccine producers recognize the value of this packaging format in reducing overfill, which is critical in th e case o f high er p ri ce /cost vaccines that may be in short supply or have a win d o w o f tim e in w hi ch t o be p ro-duced. New routes of delivery are being explored and are reaching the mar-ket. In the area of flu vaccine, there has been growth in intranasal deliv-ery. Recently, an influenza vaccine was launched by Sanofi using an intra-dermal delivery system that has the potential to provide benefits of dose sparing, shorter needle /less pain and improved immune response. The intra-dermal (ID) route is under evaluation for many newer vaccines, with more than 70 clinical trials actively using ID delivery. The ability to create an ID injection in an effective and reli-able way continues to be a challenge, although West is developing technol-ogy that may help improve current practices. BioPharm: Are there differences in the way you would formulate or package vaccine products intended for different markets (i.e., developed versus devel- oping countries )? Is this something that a developer should consider when designing a product? Thorpe: There are certainly consider- ations for vaccine packaging that have to be taken into account depending on the region served. Considerations such as regional clinical preference (i.e., needle length and gauge ) and distribu- tion systems including cold chain stor-age capabilities may affect the number of doses per package. Also, the vaccine market segment served must be considered. Is the drug a campaigned product such as influ-enza vaccine? Is the segment pediatric, adult/travelers, or perhaps an immu- nization campaign in the developing world? In the latter case, auto-disable devices are important. Other regions may require needle-stick safety protec-tion systems when safety legislation similar to what has been in place in the US since 2000 is adopted around the world. Such legislation is expected to be implemented in the EU in 2013. BioPharm: Are there differences in how you would formulate or package different vaccines types, particularly emerging vaccines, such as nanoparti-cle-based vaccines and DNA vaccines?

The move toward intradermal delivery leads to a need for more effective sys-tems for packaging and delivery, and the need to consider all aspects of the system in an i n t e gr a t e d w a y . D e s i gn o f t h e s systems should include con-sideration of the drug itself, the container, and the deliv-ery system or device, as well as consideration of who would be administering the dose and in what environment. BioPharm: There are several alter- natives to the traditional syringe for vaccine delivery: microneedle and needle-free delivery devices, for instance. Where do you see these products fitting into the marketplace, and how widespread do you think their adoption will be? What are the relative advan- tages and disadvantages of these systems? Thorpe: These systems are potential niche products for vac-cine delivery, similar to what has been seen with nasal and intra-dermal delivery. All of these sys-tems attempt to address the issue of needle phobia, which can be addressed by means other than eliminating the needle. The key issue with these delivery tech-niques, specifically for technol-ogies such as needle-free or jet in j ecti o n , is assuran ce tha t th e vaccine is reaching the intended target area, the intramuscular space. There are also issues of cross-contamination, cost, and potential wet injections that can limit use of this technology. Traditional vaccine delivery enssures that the dose is deliv-e r e d t o th e p r o p e r s i t e , i s c o s t effective and, in the case of pre-filled syringes, that the correct dose is delivered while eliminat-ing most of the wasted overfill in vials. Prefillable syringe use has expanded greatly as vaccine producers recognize the value of this packaging format in reducing overfill, which is critical in the case of higher price/cost vaccines. your enthusiasm in helping BioPharm International continue to be a top source of information for professionals in the global biopharmaceutical industry.Congratulations to the lucky winner of Apple's new iPad: CHRISTOPHE SABATIER Scientific & Patent Competitive Intelligence Servicesto all who participated in BioPharm International's 2012 Annual Readership Study! Thank you www.biopharminternational.com work/Getty Images34 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com October 2012Special Section: Vaccines Vaccines are one of the greatest achievements in public health. A recent economic analysis indi-cated that vaccination of each US birth cohort with the current childhood immunization schedule prevents approxi-mately 42,000 deaths and 20 million cases of disease, with net savings of nearly $14 billion in direct costs and $69 billion in total societal costs (1). The success of vaccination, particularly in developed nations, has been based on public recognition of their benefits, access to vaccines, and continuing efforts to pro-mote their use as an integral component of health and preventative care. Despite these successes, opportunities remain to improve vaccination coverage in the US. In 2010, the National Vaccine Plan was revised and updated, setting vaccina-tion goals and strategies aimed to ensure a stable supply of, access to, and better use of recommended vaccines in the US (2). Thus, any way to enhance or improve the sys-tems to help ensure safe and more efficient vaccination should be pursued. THE EVOLVING VACCINATION SETTING The vaccination setting in the US is rap-idly evolving from its traditional medical home to nontraditional ones, such as retail outlets, schools, and pharmacies. As an example, during the 2010-2011 influenza vaccination campaign, 18.5 % of adults received their flu shot in a retail setting (3). Along with the change in the setting is a change in the profile of vaccinators in these new settings, with those individuals possessing different and varying clinical experience and education. Another reality is that the immunization enterprise is fac-ing increasing cost pressures throughout healthcare. Furthermore, all vaccination venues are seeking opportunities to lower the costs of delivering vaccination. To help ensure consistent, efficient, and cost-effective vaccinations, all means to simplify the vaccination process should be considered. In this light, the vaccine pack-age\u2014which plays an important role at the clinical interface between vaccine, patient, and caregiver\u2014is increasingly viewed as a crucial component of vaccination. Today there are three types of vaccine packages in has different implications for clinical prac-tice, efficiency and cost, and, potentially, patient outcomes. EFFICIENCY AND PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS\u2014A CLOSER LOOK A 2010 time-motion study performed by The Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health demonstrated the safety and workflow advantages of PFSs (4). Investigators observed more than 1500 vaccine injection preparations, and deter-mined time differences and subsequent cost differences associated with the use of PFSs vs. MD Vs. They also observed prepara- tion and handling practices. Investigators found that preparing a dose using MD Vs took 37 seconds longer than with PFSs because of the increased number of steps required to prepare a vac-cine packaged in a vial. Assuming standard costs for materials and labor, researchers concluded that administration of vaccines via PFSs could save a clinic approximately $1100 per 1000 doses assuming the same price per vaccine dose. More significantly, PFSs reduce the risks associated with deviation from best prac-Vaccine Packaging Brian Lynch and Philip Song Packaging vaccines using prefilled syringes can increase dosing efficiency, reduce costs, and improve patient safety.

By eliminating the preparation steps required with a vial, a prefilled syringe is simpler and easier to use. Vaccination workflow may be faster and smoother for clinicians and may improve speed of patient throughput. An additional and important advantage offered by PFSs is that they come from the manufacturer, labeled by the manufacturer. All too often, syringes predrawn from vaccine vials are left unlabeled, or are subject to variable labeling practices, clinic by clinic or perhaps even clinician by clinician. This variability increases the risk of a wrong or improperly stored injectable vaccine being given; dos- ing errors also increase when vac- cine is prepared and labeled by hand (7). Prefilled and prelabeled syringes avoid these errors and omissions, ensure accurate dosing, and offer clin- ics a ready-to-use, safe, and simple time-saving alternative to predrawing several vaccine syringes in advance. VARIABILITY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE Variations from clinical best practices can be influenced by many different factors, including experience, educa-UJPO \u0001BOE\u0001iSFBM\u000eMJGFw\u0001DMJOJDJBO \u0001TDFOBS - ios (e.g., multi-tasking, distractions, or work-flow pressure ). While the vac- cine enterprise in the US is considered safe, there have been case studies that show that errors in preparation and administration can occur. In 2010, Premier Safety Institute conducted a large study with more than 5000 clinicians to understand UIF\u0001iDVSSFOU \u0001JOKFDUJPO \u0001QSBDUJDF \u0001 reports of outbreaks in the US involv-ing transmission of Hepatitis B and C to patients associated with unsafe injection practices and breakdowns in CBTJD\u0001JOGFDUJPO \u0001DPOUSPMw \u0001 \u0019 \u000f\u0001'PS\u0001FYBN - ple, an outbreak occurred during the 2007-2008 influenza campaign when a New York physician's office engaged in a practice of drawing six 0.5-m L influenza vaccine doses into a 3-m L syringe and subsequently vaccinated six individuals with the same syringe while only changing the needle (9). The Premier study revealed that this practice may be more widespread than perhaps anticipated: 0.9 % of the clinicians in the survey reported that they change the needle but reuse the syringe on multiple patients. In this same study, 6 % of the clinicians also reported using single-dose or single-use vials for more than one patient, and 1.1 % reused a syringe to enter a multi-dose vial and then saved that vial for use on another patient (8). CDC guidelines recommend that healthcare workers use single-dose vials, syringes, and needles only once, which precludes their use in more than one patient.

The study identified all distinct opera-tions within each risk category for potential contribution to risk.

In the user interface study, the number of distinct steps involved in delivering vaccine from the three packaging platforms\u2014up to 50 for multi-dose vials, 45 for single-dose vials, and 28 for PFSs\u2014suggests an advantage to the simpler PFS proto-col. By reducing the number of steps, there is less opportunity for error. For example, PFSs have a demon- strated advantage in contamination control because needle changes and drawing drugs from vials ( and all the contamination potential those steps entail) do not occur with prefills. Similarly, replacing a highly variable step like syringe filling by a clinician with highly precise aseptic machine filling can help assure administration of the correct dose, as well as reduce the likelihood of contamination. Finally, opportunities for administer-ing the wrong dose or expired vac- cine are minimized by labels being applied on every PFS by the man-ufacturer. Preapplied labels thereby facilitate the task so it is easier, and provide a means of detection as the PFS reaches the end user and point PG\u0001VTF\u0001XJUI\u0001B\u0001MBCFM\u000f\u00013FBEJMZ\u0001BQQBSFOU \u0001 labels also enable corrective protocols to be followed immediately in the event an incorrect drug or incorrect dosage is injected, thus mitigating further effects of the error. Being prelabeled, unit-dose, and ready-to-administer, PFSs to use, elimi-nation of several error-prone steps in vaccine preparation and admin-istration, reduced opportunity for syringe reuse and cross-contamina-tion, and assurance of the correct dose. Printed peel-off labels on vac-cine prefills can facilitate record-ing of batch numbers and updating immunization records. A MARKET IN TRANSITION The clinical and workflow benefits of PFSs compared with vials rest on the inherent differences required to prepare a dose of a vaccine, or any injectable, packaged in a unit-dose, ready-to-administer format versus a non-ready-to-use format, whether single or multi-dose. With their inherently simple design, prefilled syringes do not rely on consistently flawless and tech-nique and aseptic practices to reduce injection-related risks\u2014instead, they completely eliminate the need for several of the preparation steps that open the door to avoidable risks and consume additional clinician time. In a sense, they embody safety-by-design principles that are important when considering human factors and the user interface. The growing recognition of the many advantages of PFSs have fueled a significant shift towards their use for all vaccine types, most signifi-cantly influenza, where the percent of flu vaccine packaged in PFSs has grown from approximately 21 % dur- ing the 2006-2007 campaign to 48 % in 2012-2013 (12). In Europe, nearly all of these same vaccines brought to market are packaged in PFSs (13). Further adoption of vaccines pack- aged in PFSs is expected to continue, for both new and currently marketed vaccines, particularly as clinicians and vaccine enterprise stakeholders look more closely at the implication of packaging at the user interface and understand the benefits PFSs offer in terms of greater efficiency and advancing best care.

A Datamonitor study estimates 2009 sales of biosimilar products in the United States and five leading European markets at $150 million. In 2015, when 32 biolog-ics enjoying annual sales of $51 billion will have lost patent protection, biosimilar sales are expected to reach $3.7 billion (1). Unlike with generic small-molecule drugs, however, creating an exact copy of a thera- peutic protein is impossible. Regulatory agencies, therefore, evaluate biosimilars based on their degree of chemical and ther-apeutic similarity to innovator biologics. The depth and breadth of testing required to demonstrate similarity that meet regulators' expectations, some of which are still evolving, depends on the degree to which sponsors collect and vali-date comparability data during develop-ment. Those who create a compelling case will likely experience a lower regula-tory burden. BACKGROUND The 2009 Biologics Price Competition and Innovation (BPCI) Act authorized the US FDA to devise an approval pathway for biosimilar products. FDA's February 2012 draft guidance document, Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product , defines biosimilars as molecules that are \"highly similar\" to a ref-erence product, with \"no clinically mean-ingful differences\" (2). The draft document warns of signifi- cant differences between approval mecha-nisms for small molecule and biologic follow-on products, specifically that a one-size-fits-all pathway would not be possible. FDA says it will instead \"consider the totality of the evidence\" when assess-ing follow-on products (2). Specifically, FDA will consider the prod- uct's complexity, formulation, stability, and analytics, and then apply a risk-based approach relying heavily on pharmacovigi-lance. The draft FDA guidance is modeled on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 2004 biosimilars guidance document, which is currently undergoing an update (3). In general, FDA and EMA biosimilars guidance documents are considered to be consistent with each other. The main dif-ference between the two agencies' perspec-tives on biosimilars is tied to the issue of \"interchangability.\" FDA has the authority to designate interchangability while EMA leaves this designation to national regula-tors. There are additional minor differences in the guidance documents. However, because the FDA guidance document is still in draft form and the EMA document is undergoing a revision, it is safe to say that both regions' regulations are evolving in this area. Economic and market differences between biosimilars and generic drugs will be striking in the years ahead, according to a Federal Trade Commission assessment, as follows: t\u0001\u0001$PN QFUJUJPO \u0001CFUXFFO \u0001JOOPWBUPS \u0001ESVHT\u0001 competition than brand-to-generic competition t\u0001\u0001%JTDPVOUT\u0001GPS\u0001CJPTJNJMBST \u0001XJMM\u0001CF\u0001NPE- est, in the 10 %-30% range, versus up for small-molecule generic drugs t\u0001\u0001'%\"\u0001BQQSPWBMT \u0001XJMM\u0001JOWPMWF \u0001TJHOJGJDBOU \u0001 investments: to years of devel-opment time and between $100 and $200 million, compared with three to five years and $1 million to $5 million for generic drugs t \u0001\u0001#JPTJNJMBST E\u0001CZ\u0001MBSHFS \u0001 companies and large-market (above $250 Key Considerations in Biosimilars Development Raymond Donninger, Joe Bower, Raymond Kaiser, Sian Estdale, and John Carlsen Understanding opportunities and challenges across all major phases of development.

STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT Nonclinical considerations Nonclinical data typically encom- pass comparative in vitro phar- macology and in vivo studies of efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pos-sibly toxicology, including toxicoki-netics, antidrug antibody, and local tolerance. Biological characteriza-tion, usually part of the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) or drug quality package, also needs to be included in the nonclinical safety data package. In vitro and cell-based characterization will be the most criti-cal assays from a nonclinical compa-rability perspective. Critical nonclinical consider- during development planning (e.g., EMA's molecular class-specific guidances ), nonclinical innovator data from conferences, the European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs) and published literature. One caveat to using existing data that has been generated in studies on older biological drugs is that the data may not be sufficiently detailed or comparable for validating study endpoints. Keep in mind that toxi-cokinetic and antidrug antibody data may be sparse or nonexistent and animal models used in older studies may no longer be available or rel-evant. Moreover, analytical methods have improved significantly, as has the ability to utilize biomarkers. CMC considerations Preclinical CMC studies are crucial for achieving an abbreviated approval pathway for a biosimilar. GMP batch release assays should be supple-mented by additional characteriza-tion studies to enhance the claim of similarity, for example with GMP / GLP cell-based and in vitro assays. Because innovator companies do not publish detailed CMC results, this information must be produced inde-pendently using results from clone selection, media and feed develop-ment, purification and formulation. Biosimilar developers may improve on the innovator molecule through modern manufacturing and analyt-ics, but this improvement may trigger designation by regulatory authorities as a \"biobetter,\" or even an innova- tor drug, resulting in a more exten-sive development pathway. Biobetters are considered new molecular entities and usually require a full develop-ment process. CHARACTERIZATION Analytical methods Analytical methods for develop-ing biosimilars are similar to those used for developing innovator drugs. However, because the goal with biosimilars is comparability, the approaches and issues associ-ated with the analytical methods are somewhat different, as explained below. For a biosimilar erythropoietin (EPO), for example, the sponsor must use the same EPO brand as the com- parator. The sponsor must purchase several lots and either aim for proper-ties somewhere in the middle of the range shown by the innovator drug or demonstrate the same level of vari-ability. The same approach applies to stability, accelerated stability, and shelf life. Animal testing Comparative in vivo animal efficacy studies are useful in demonstrating nonclinical similarity. Some models, however, are proprietary, and others may have become redundant since the innovator drug was introduced. By contrast, comparative in vivo ani- mal safety studies can be less valu-able. EMA product specific guidelines, for example, suggest that the rodent is the species of choice wherever pos-sible for biosimilar testing (3). This type of testing is possible with com-pounds such as EPO, but less so with monoclonal antibodies, where non-human primates are frequently the only relevant species. Animal safety studies may be complemented by an assessment of pharmacodynamic responses in some cases, but this is not always possible with highly human-specific biotherapeutics. Predicting human immunoge- nicity and pharmacokinetics from Figure 1: Analysis of characterization of biosimilars versus new biologic entities (NBEs). There is a need for more extensive characterization for biosimilars than for innovator drugs. The trend in the industry is that analytical technology advances will continue at the same pace and will allow for more accurate physico- chemical and biological characterization, which may provide more guidance to nonclinical, pharmacokinetic/pharma codynamic, and clinical studies. October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm 39Biosimilars primate studies can be similarly chal- lenging. Antidrug antibodies (ADAs), which occur regularly in test ani-mals, may often confound pharma-cokinetic studies. Primate toxicology studies lack sufficient statistical power, and immunogenicity is gen-erally poorly predictive of clinical immunogenicity. The majority of biologics do not show true toxicity, but rather exaggerated pharmacology. Hence, toxicology studies may add limited value for these molecules if not carefully designed. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS Early discussions with regulators regarding clinical studies of biosimi-lars are highly recommended to confirm that the preclinical pack-age will adequately support clinical development. These discussions also are essential if the sponsor plans to extrapolate efficacy and safety data across different indications. Certain clinical study design issues are specific to biosimilars. Comparability must be shown in a step-wise fashion in both the phar-macokinetic and pharmacodynamic settings. Immunogenicty assessment is also required to show correlation to clinical efficacy and safety. Sponsors need to evaluate immunogenic-ity in all individuals in the clinical trial, not only those who are symp-tomatic. Sponsors must demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety through clearly defined comparability mar-gins. Equivalence studies are required under the current European guid- ance, but noninferiority designs may be acceptable. To streamline patient recruitment, sponsors may petition to combine Phases I and III, a strategy that EMA is currently considering. Securing patients and investigator sites is yet another reason to perform prelimi-nary clinical feasibility studies well ahead of Phase III, preferably dur-ing preclinical work. An important consideration of clinical feasibility assessment /site identification is that some sites motivated by innovative or novel studies may not wish to par- ticipate in biosimilar studies. Drug supply can affect how the sponsor chooses to test a drug. Studies conducted in the European Union, for example, must employ reference material registered in Europe. In the US, FDA is likely to require US-registered material (2). Regulators in both regions are in discussion and considering ways to relax origination rules, perhaps by allowing for a future single source option for reference material. PHARMACOVIGILANCE Although biosimilars are not expected to pose any more risk to patients than innovator drugs, their devel-opers should be prepared for signifi-cant postmarketing commitments. A potential hurdle with biosimi-lar pharmacovigilance is specifi-cally tracking which drug patients receive. This problem already is apparent among the branded EPO class drugs. A patient, for example, may receive three different mole-cules that read \" EPO\" from three different manufacturers. Unless hos-pital staff are instructed to maintain strict records, determining which product was administered is dif-ficult, and tracing adverse events backwards can be impossible. MARKET ACCESS As with innovator drugs, the com-mercial success of biosimilars depends on the three main stake-holders of market access: payers, providers, and patients. Although the potential cost savings that biosimilars offer may be attractive to payers, some may be reluctant to steer utilization towards these agents without compelling safety, efficacy, and comparability data. Similarly, prescribers and patients may prefer proven treatments over somewhat less-expensive products that may not have a track record. To facilitate market access, biosimilar developers should there-fore consider providing customer support resources, such as reim-bursement hotlines, that are on par with those offered for innova-tor drugs. This offering could be especially relevant for indications such as oncology, where providers have high expectations regarding customer support. Market access will become even more competi-tive as biosimilars enter the mar-ket because innovator companies are expected to ramp up their own customer support resources to solidify brand loyalty. Biosimilars developers also should engage in the full spectrum of market access planning activities, such as con-ducting landscape assessments and performing market research with stakeholders, early on in clinical development. CONCLUSION Biosimilars development presents challenges at every level, from selec-tion of a manufacturing platform, to analytical assays demonstrating comparability, to in vivo testing and clinical testing, market access, and postmarketing surveillance. Sponsors can minimize roadblocks while streamlining biosimilar development by frontloading analytical methods that demonstrate comparability with the reference molecule, selecting animal studies judiciously, and pre-paring to maintain a Phase I V drug registry. Companies that navigate these activities successfully may be rewarded with an expedited regula-tory review. REFERENCES 1. Datamonitor, \"Pharma.

Freezing protein BDS provides flexibility by enabling longer shelf-life for the drug substance and decoupling BDS manufacture from that of drug product. Despite the advantages offered by freezing of protein BDS, there are several technical challenges associated with freezing and thawing of protein drug substance. These include phen omena such as cryoconcentration and protein denaturation on ice-water interfaces. Celsius bags are used in the biot echnology industry for freezing BDS using a cryoprocessing unit. This study evaluated the extent of cryoconcentration in Celsius bags by creating a comprehensive map of the solute distribution in terms of osmolality and protein concentration for a formulated monoclonal antibody (mAb) solution in 8.3-L bags. The authors assessed the effect of freezing rate, solute (i.e., trehalose) concentration, and fill volume. A considerable degree of cryoconcentration for the solute was seen as a function of fill depth as well as the distance from the active cooling surface, with highest levels near the bottom and middle of the bag. Freezing rate affected the extent of cryoconcentration when the fill vo lume was low. Higher solute concentration resulted in a larger concentration gradient in the frozen state compared with low solute concentration.Parag Kolhe, Anjali Mehta, Alanta SinghLarge-Scale Freezing of Biologics (Part III) Understanding Frozen-State Protein and Solute Concentration Changes in Celsius Bags Parag Kolhe* is a senior principal scientist, Anjali Mehta is a scientist, Alanta Lary is a senior scientist, Steven Chico is an assoicate scientist, and Satish K.

PEER-REVIEWED Article submitted: May 29, 2012. Article accepted: Jul. 10, 2012.The freeze-thaw operation is a crucial step in protein therapeutics production, and is typically applied to protein bulk drug substance (BDS) to enhance its shelf-life and manage the logistics of drug substance cam-paigns independent of drug product demand. Freezing reduces the deg-radation rate of the drug substance, protects against microbial contamina-tion or growth, and enables transport without risk of agitation and air-liq-uid interface-induced denaturation. However, despite these advantages and the seemingly simple techni-cal operation, freezing and thawing of protein BDS presents significant fundamental physico-chemical chal-l e n g e s a s w e l l a s p r o c e s s i n g c h a l -l eng es a t larg e scal e . So m e o f th ese challenges include cryoconcentration, pH and ionic strength changes, phase separation, phase changes, ice-water interface-induced denaturation, as well as reproducibility and unifor-mity of processing when performed at commercial scales. These aspects have been reviewed by the authors in earlier publications (1-3). The authors have also studied (in parts I and II of this series ) the behavior of solutes and proteins in scaled-down systems designed to mimic 300- L cryovessels October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 41Peer-Reviewed: Freezing of Biologics to gain an understanding of the envi- ronment to which the protein is exposed under different processing conditions and in different parts of the cryovessel (4, 5). In this report, part III of this series, the authors extend their study to disposable bag systems designed for cryoprocessing. The Celsius Pak system (Sartorius Stedim ) is designed to provide an active freeze / thaw processing and storage option for BDS at smaller scales than cryovessels. The use of multiple bags (up to 8.3 L / 16.6 L) all o ws a ba t ch t o be sp li t u p in t o s mall er aliquots to provide flexibility in drug product manufacturing. The Celsius Pak bags are processed (i.e., frozen or thawed ) by a dedicated cryoprocessing unit that allows predefined temperature profiles to be run in a reproducible manner, irrespec-tive of the batch size (6). Solute and protein distribution have been studied for plastic bottles frozen in freezers by a passive freezing process (7-9). Concentration and osmolality map- ping studies in plastic bottles showed that the (macro ) cryoconcentration in plastic bottles is dependent on freezing tempera-ture, protein concentration, and fill depth (7, 8). Lashmar et al. also evaluated freeze concentration for small-scale (30-mL) bags and found a twofold increase in protein concentration and osmolality (9). Large- scale bags have, to date, only been studied by Padala et al., who examined the Celsius Pak 8.3- L system using bovine serum albu- min (BSA) as model protein and found an approximately 1.4-fold cryoconcentration in the lower middle part of the Celsius bag (10). In the previous reports in this series, the authors have shown that (macro )-cryo- concentration in the cryowedge system (representing a cryovessel ) is significantly affected by density-driven convection gra- dients, as demonstrated by protein con- centration and osmolality changes during and after freezing (4, 5). A limitation of the cryowedge is that the depth of solu- t i o n i s l i m i t e d t o a r o u n d 1 0 c m . T h e aspect ratio (i.e., liquid depth to diameter ) is very small in the cryowedge compared wi th th e real tank i t is su pposed t o rep- resent. Thus, convective effects may not be o pera ti o nal t o th e sam e ext en t as in the full-scale tank. In this third report of the series, the authors examine the solute distribution in the frozen state in Celsius ba gs as a fun cti o n o f fill d epth , so l u t e concentration, and processing (i.e., freez- ing) rate. The data suggest that convec- tive effects become increasingly important in the distribution of solutes in practical systems, with fill depth being a key pro-cess parameter. Solute concentration deter-mines the density gradients generated and therefore the extent of solute polarization. In all of these studies, it must be remem- bered that using ice-core samples provides a measure of the macro-cryoconcentration only, that is, it provides a way to understand the solute movement in the system during freezing and the resultant solute polariza-tion across the geometry. The true or micro-concentration is given by the phase or state diagram of the solute system, disregarding the nonequilibrium effects in a real-time process. The results reported from ice-coring analyses are dependent on the size of the core and the distribution of the core sam-ples. Smaller cores and dense sampling will give a more realistic picture of the solute distribution (the macro-cryoconcentration ) than otherwise.

Processing was carried out by using a FT-100 system that uses silicone oil (Silthermxx, Dow ) body (mAb) at 5 mg /mL in a 20 mM histidine buffer, pH 5.5, with 0.2 mg /mL poly- sorbate 80 and either 84 mg /mL or 2 1 mg /mL trehalose dihydrate was used as a model protein for this study. A bench-top band saw (Delta SM400 Shopmaster 3 Amp 9-Inch band saw ) was used to cut the frozen Celsius bags into sections. As described previously, a Dewalt drill with a custom-made drill bit (diameter 1.5 cm ) was used t o tak e co res (approximately 2.5 cm long) from the frozen block (4, 5, 8). Protein concentration in the cores was measured after thawing by U V280. Solute concentration was assessed by measuring osmolality of the thawed core solution using a freezing point osmometer (Advanced Instruments, Model 3250 ). Celsius bag mapping in the frozen state In-house mAb solution was frozen using either a slow or standard freezing cycle as shown in Figure 1a . In the standard freez- ing cycle, HTF is rapidly cooled to 60 C and the freezing process is allowed to go to completion over 5 h. In the slow freez-ing cycle, the freezing was completed over 13 h. Figure 1b provides a road map of the study design. Celsius bags (8.3-L size) were filled with IgG2 mAb solution containing either 21 mg /mL trehalose or 84 mg /mL tre- halose to volumes of either 2 L or 8 L, and frozen using the standard freezing cycle. In other experiments, an 8.3- L Celcius bag was filled with the mAb solution contain-ing 84 mg /mL trehalose to a fill volume of 2 L or 8 L and frozen using the slow freez- ing cycle. Once the material in the bags was frozen, the bags were stored at 40 C until further processing. In the frozen state, the 2- L fill corre- sponds to an approximate depth of 20 cm and the 8- L fill to 80 cm. The frozen Celsius bags were cut and cores taken according to a predetermined template. This procedure ensured that the maximum amount of information would be obtained for concentration and osmo-lality distribution. RESULTS In previous studies, the authors demon-strated that the cryoconcentration and solute gradient in protein solutions pro-gressively develops during the freezing step. If thawed without agitation, this gra-dient is maintained irrespective of con-tainer configuration (i.e., plastic bottles or cryowedge ). The objective of this specific study was to map the solution proper-ties in 8.3- L Celsius bags in the frozen state and study the effect of fill volume, freezing rate, and trehalose concentration and determine if there is any interdepen-dence of these factors on observed cryo-concentration. Ice cores were taken from the frozen block and protein concentra-tion and osmolality were measured.

The implications of this important but commonly ignored aspect of the measure-ment technique were discussed in a previ-ous publication (5). Celsius bags frozen state mapping: effect of freezing rate and fill depth Standard and slow process cycles were employed for freezing the mAb solution containing 84 mg /mL of trehalose. The ba gs w ere fill ed wi th ei th er 2 L or 8 L of solution. Figure 2a shows the osmolality map obtained for the standard freezing ra t e in an 8.3- L bag. The data are shown for front, middle, and back sections in the vertical plane. For the front and back sections of the bag, the osmolality ranged from 128 to 920 mOsm /Kg. The high- est osmolality values were observed in slice 1 (the lowest horizontal slice ) of the bag, with the middle section showing the greatest increase. The osmolality in the front and back sections corresponds to a more than three times greater cryocon-centration when compared with the initial osmolality of the solution (initial osmolal- ity values was 280 mOsm /Kg). The extent of cryoconcentration increased for the middle section, where the highest osmo-lality of 1733 mOsm /Kg (approximately 6 times higher than the initial value ) was measured. The solution is cooled at the walls, becomes denser, and flows down along the walls carrying the solute. The denser, concentrated solute is deposited at the bottom and the solvent convects back up through the middle section, leading to the concentration distribution observed. The corresponding protein concentra- tion map for the standard freeze thaw is shown in Figure 2b . The concentration in the front, back, and middle section ranged from 0.6 to 19.4 mg /mL. The high- est concentration profile was observed for the bottom slices, 1 and 2. The observed cryoconcentration of protein at the bot-tom sections of the bag was approximately four times higher than the initial value. No significant differences in absolute maxi-mum concentration levels between the mid-dle and front /back sections was observed, although the distribution was not as com-pact as for the solutes in Figure 2a . This finding suggests that the solutes and protein are not migrating completely in tandem, with the protein lagging somewhat behind. Osmolality and protein concentration maps for the slow freezing cycle are shown in Figures 3a and 3b, respectively. The gen- eral trends are similar compared with the results for the standard freezing cycle. The osmolality ranged from 8 7 to 685 mOsm /kg for the front and back section of the Celsius bag. The osmolality for the middle section ranged from 87 to 13 7 4 mOsm /kg. Protein concentration ranged from 0.6 mg /mL to 13.4 mg /mL for the front, back, and mid- dle sections.

The slow cycle leads to a higher level of cryocon-centration in the middle section compared with the standard cycle (956 mOsm /Kg compared with 382 mOsm /Kg). Smaller protein concentration ranges are seen, with a maximum of 5.8 mg /mL in the middle for the standard cycle. The results show that solution depth as well as distance from the cooling surface determine the solute and protein distri-bution at the end of the freezing process. Solutes seem to cryoconcentrate in the middle section near the bottom while the protein is a slightly more widely distrib-uted in the front and back sections too, but again near the bottom. The rate of cooling has a less significant role, prob-ably because the immobilization of flow is completed in a similar time despite the different cycles. Celsius bags frozen state mapping: Effect of trehalose concentration and fill depth A second formulation containing treha-lose at a lower concentration, 21 mg /mL instead of 84 mg /mL, was tested to under- stand if the trehalose concentration can contribute to the distribution through the density gradient that is generated. Both 8-L fill and 2- L fills were employed using the standard cycle. Results are shown in Figures 6a and 6b (osmolality and concen- tration respectively ) for the 8- L fill and in Figure 7 for the 2- L fill. The overall distribution is similar to that of high tre-hlose solutions, with cryoconcentration effects seen near the bottom /middle sec- tions. However, the maximum osmolality measured for the 21 mg /mL solution (8-L fill) was 280 mOsm /Kg, representing a 4- fold increase (from 70 mOsm /Kg) whereas it was 1733 mOSm ). The high tre- halose concentration leads to a greater density gradient formation and thus a higher degree of solute polarization. The differences were not as significant for the corresponding protein concentra-tion. With the 8- L fill, the maximum protein concentration observed with 21 mg /mL treha-lose was 15.9 mg /mL (see Figure 6b ) com- pared with 19.4 mg mg /mL trehalose (see Figure 3b ). Similar results were observed for the 2- L fill. The highest protein concentration observed for both low and high trehalose concentrations was 5.8 mg /mL. Cryoconcentration and its effect For all the conditions studied, an assess- ment of fraction of total protein mass affected by the cryoconcentration effect was performed. These findings are impor-tant since the highly concentrated protein Figure 4: Osmolality and protein concentration map for standard freezing cycle (2-L fill).

Figure 8a shows the data as percentage of affected protein mass for the various conditions studied. Most of the protein concentration fraction observed was for one-fold cryoconcentration or below (5 mg/mL or below ). The slow freez- ing cycle with a 2- L fill containing high trehalose showed the highest fraction (92%) while the standard freezing cycle with an 8- L fill containing high trehalose showed the lowest fraction (60%) of pro- tein in this concentration range. The high-est fraction for two-fold and above was observed for the standard freezing cycle with an 8- L fill containing low trehalose followed by the standard freezing cycle with an 8- L fill containing high trehalose. Th e l o w e s t fr a cti o n in thi s r e gi o n w as for the slow freezing cycle with a 2- L fill containing high trehalose. Similarly, the maximum fraction of cryoconcentration of three-fold and higher was observed for the standard freezing cycle with an 8- L fill containing high trehalose. A similar analysis for osmolality frac- tion was performed. Figure 8b provides the analysis for various conditions stud-ied. The highest fraction (83%) for 1X and below (280 mOsm /kg for and 70 mOsm /kg for low trehalose ) was observed for standard freezing cycle with 2-L fill containing high trehalose and the lowest fraction (6%) was observed for standard freezing cycle with 8- L fill con- taining low trehalose. The highest frac-tion (88%) for one-fold cryoconcentration and above was observed for the standard freezing cycle with an 8- L fill contain- ing low trehalose and the lowest fraction (17%) was observed for the standard freez- ing cycle with a 2- L fill containing high trehalose. The highest fraction (4%) of three-fold and above cryoconcentration was observed for standard freezing cycle with 8- L fill containing high trehalose. Based on this analysis, it is clear that the actual fraction that is cryoconcentrated to greater than two-fold level is less than 20% of the complete system. DISCUSSION It is clear that macro-cryoconcentration is inevitable for all the practical-scale freez-ing systems. The actual distribution of ice and solute /protein may vary in the geo- metric space of the container depending on the process conditions and composi- tion. Physically, the extent of this solute polarization will be proportional to the solution depth because of density gradi- ent-driven convection during the process- ing . Furth erm o re , i t is cl ear tha t freezing rates can have an effect on cryoconcentra- tion, especially for low fill volumes in the Celsius bag system. This analysis shows that less than 20 % of the solutes are affected by the highest level of cryoconcentration (concentration Figure 6: (a) Osmolality and (b) protein concentration map for standard freezing cycle for 8-L fill with low trehalose. Front Section Middle Section Back Section0 2 46 8 10 12 14(a) (b) October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 47Peer-Reviewed: Freezing of Biologics more than 2 times initial levels ). The lev- els of cryoconcentration observed here compare well to those seen in previous studies, such as Webb et al. for plastic bot-tle, who reported that 91.6 % of the total protein was at less than a two-fold level of cryoconcentration (11). Previous results using the cryowedge system suggested that more than 90 % of the total protein was at less than two-fold level of cryoconcentra-tion (5). Taken together, these results from plastic bottles, cryowedge, and Celsius bag system suggest that in most practical systems, the percentage of protein that is subject to more than two-fold cryoconcen-tration is in the vicinity of 10 %. The highest osmolality and protein con- centration were observed near the bottom of the Celsius bag. The point of maximum osmolality observed is in the bottom /mid- dle section, which is the farthest from the active cooling surfaces. The authors have established that th e freezing p r o fil es ha v e an eff ect o n cryoconcentration, especially when the fill volume is low (8 L versus 2 L in this study). At the high fill volume, a max- imum of six-fold cryoconcentration for standard freezing versus five-fold for slow freezing was observed. This observation can be explained by the fact that when the processing volumes are large, the freezing profile effects are not that pro-nounced and are largely governed by the processing volume. On the other hand, when the processing volume is small, the freezing profile has a greater effect on the o u t co m e . In g en eral , s l o w freezing all o ws more time for the ice to freeze and push solutes forward, thus leading to a greater degree of polarization. The extent of cryoconcentration is higher when the trehalose concentration is higher. In our previous paper, we attrib- uted this to the property of disaccharide solutions, which have significant tempera-ture coefficients for density and viscosity compared with water or buffer solution alone (5). When a high-concentration disaccharide solution is subjected to cool-ing, smaller temperature differences will lead to larger density gradients (as com- pared with a low-concentration solution ), resulting in greater convection effects, downwards at the cooling surface and in towards the center. In their recent publication, Padala et al. Figure 7: Osmolality and protein concentration map for standard freezing cycle for 2L fill with low trehalose. Figure 8: (a) Analysis of cryoconcentration effect on osmolality and (b) protein concentration effects for various conditions studied. Front Section ConcentrationOsmolality Middle Section Back SectionStandard Freeze-8L ll-Low Trehalose 140 2 4 6 8 reported only a 1.4-fold cryoconcentration in the bottom center vertical of the Celsius bag, with no cryoconcentration effects for the front and back vertical sections of the bag (10). Although the general observa- tion of cryoconcentration is similar to our study, the low extent of cryoconcentration reported is a function of the study design. The data presented in that specific study were based on 27 total cores as opposed to 140 total cores taken in our study. If a limited number of cores are taken or large cores are taken and the data are aver-aged over a large portion of the container, the reported cryoconcentration effect will be smaller than actual, as seen in Padala et al (10). This result can be understood by the simple thought experiment that if the whole bag is frozen and subsequently thawed as one sample and analyzed, no cryoconcentration would be reported, and would clearly be in error. This illustrates the importance of examining the design of the study when assessing results reported in the literature. Smaller but more numer-ous core samples taken from the frozen block at various positions provide a better picture of the solute polarization. CONCLUSIONS Cryoconcentration is inevitable in any sys-tem used to freeze bulk protein drug solu-tions of any practical size. The extent of solute and protein polarization will depend on freezing rate profile, the depth of solu-tion, and the solute concentration, and is a consequence of density gradient-driven convective effects. The greatest changes will be observed near the center, farthest from the cooling surfaces and near the bot-tom in terms of geometry. Greater depth will allow for greater differences, as will high solute concentrations. As solution vol-ume to be processed increases, the effect of the freezing rate profile decreases. The so-called \"controlled rate\" freez- ing does not eliminate cryoconcentration. Controlled or more accurately, \"active\" freezing, however, enables a reproducible process that will in general be less subject to vagaries of freezer load, placement posi-tion, and other factors compared with a passive freezing process conducted in a freezer. For the same volume and geom-etry, an active freezing process will also generally be more rapid than passive freez-ing, reducing the time that the protein is exposed to the phase-transition envi-ronment where the greatest damage may occur (1, 12).

Domike, Jeffrey T. Macher, Paul W. Barone, Stacy L. Springs, Anthony J. Sinskey, and Scott SternAlthough there is awareness among the biopharmceuti-cal industry of the challenges and trade-offs associated with monitoring the safety of drug products, there does not seem to be a clear and con-sistent understanding of characteristics correlated with the presence of critical-to-quality deviations of a product at the com-mercial scale (1). The intent of this paper is to initiate an understanding of prod-uct and site characteristics that statisti-cally correlate with quality performance of biopharmaceutical commercial products. Towards this objective, a comprehensive survey on related topics is underway at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center for Biomedical Innovation (CBI). The interim results described in this research represent survey results from 34 commercial-scale biopharmaceutical prod-ucts at 11 international sites. This research builds on analysis done by the MIT CBI team earlier this year (2). Some regulatory agencies, including FDA, have actively pursued a risk-based approach to manufacturing site inspection because their inspections are site-specific and not restricted to an individual prod-uct (1). Explicit inputs that FDA uses for its risk-based selection of sites to inspect include the types of products manufac-tured (e.g., prescription versus over-the- counter, approved versus unapproved, therapeutic classes ); the control and /or contamination potential of the manufac-turing environment (e.g., facility size, facil- ity type, number of drug products, sterility requirements ); and cost of inspection (e.g., domestic versus international locations ). These inputs are logical for consideration of total risk to quality at the level of a site, but, in this research, the focus regarding quality is on the product. SURVEY METHODOLOGY A comprehensive survey on topics related to site characteristics, quality approaches, quality activities, perception of relative consistency of regulators, product-level process details, and product-level compli-ance performance has been developed by MIT's CBI. The survey includes ques-tions that result in a total of 57 variables across these topic areas. The developed survey was tested with industry represen-tatives and then deployed over the past 18 months as a secure web-based ques- tionnaire directly to biopharmaceutical manufacturing sites through several dif-ferent channels. The individuals targeted for inclusion as survey respondents have been manufacturing plant managers or their representatives. In total, 20 sites representing 52 manu- factured products have completed the sur-vey. These responses have been filtered to focus on commercial-scale manufacturing and products for which all relevant infor-mation was provided. This reduced the number of products included thus far to 34 across 11 sites. The research is supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation of New York City. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Characteristics of the products and sites The demographics of the 34 products included in the analysis are organized into the following groups:Correlating Product Lifecycle and Manufacturing Site Characteristics with Critical-to-Quality Product Deviations of Commercial BiopharmaceuticalsProduct Quality October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 51Market(s) served t\u0001 Twenty-nine of the products surveyed are marketed in the US; 24 in Canada; 33 in Europe; 26 in Japan; 17 in South America; and 20 in Asia (outside of Japan ).

There is a wide distribution of where technical personnel are assigned within the sites (particularly visible from the distribution of technical personnel in manufacturing ) suggesting one or more of the following scenarios across the sites that completed the survey:t\u0001 Different role definitions for pers- onnel within the technical areas t\u0001 Structural differences between sites necessitating different distributions of personnel t\u0001 Different priorities and /or focus of the site management t\u0001 Lack of understanding regarding optimal distribution of technical personnel. Site-level drivers of change Each site was asked to identify sig- nificant sources, or drivers, of changes in quality efforts and activities at their site. The respondents indicated whether specific drivers had been experienced by the site in the past and/or are anticipated drivers for the site in the future. The results from the survey of the sites are presented in Figure 3 , ordered from left to right in descending order of fraction of sites identifying the type of driver as one that has been experienced in the past.

Correlations with critical-to-quality product deviations Using critical-to-quality defects at the commercial scale as the dependent variable, 56 other variables were com-pared based on likelihood ratios for each of the 34 commercial products. Of these 56 variables, 11 were found to have statistically significant dif-ferent likelihoods depending upon whether a critical-to-quality defect was experienced for that product. These 11 variables of significance are shown in Figure 4 and grouped based on confidence level of statisti-cal significance (the top row contains variables for which the difference in likelihood ratio demonstrated greatest confidence ) and grouped based on whether the correlation was nega-tively or positively correlated with a critical-to-quality defect at the com-mercial scale. If the variable is in the negatively correlated section of Figure 4 , then presence of that vari- able is more likely to occur for a prod-uct without a reported critical defect. For example, a product manufac- tured at commercial scale in a site having an above-median fraction of technical personnel working in QA was statistically less likely to have experienced a critical-to-quality defect at the commercial scale. On the other hand, a positively correlated variable is more likely to be present for a prod-uct that has experienced a critical defect. For example, a product manu-factured in Asia is more likely to have experienced such a defect. Consistent with prior preliminary discussion regarding variables corre-lated with product defects, many of the statistically significant variables presented in Figure 4 fall into the cat- egories of history of quality issues in the product lifecycle, geographic region of manufacture, and manu-facture in a contract manufacturing site (2). Of note is the dependence upon fraction of technical personnel employed in QA and employed in manufacturing. More generally, this dependence is related to the discus- sion of the distribution of technical personnel across a site as described above, where the lack of consis- tency and, perhaps, understand- ing of an optimal distribution was Frequency Fraction of Technical Personnel in a Manufacturing Position6 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0.1 0.2 90% 80%70%60%50%40%30%20%10% 0% Experienced in the PastProduction Process Change from Regulator Raw Material Equipment Non-compliance Scale-up New Technology Cost Reduction Pursuit of New Markets Expected in the Future Figure 2: Fraction of technical personnel in a manufacturing position across sites surveyed.

The data presented in Figure 4 demonstrates that above median level of the fraction of tech-nical personnel in QA and below median level of the fraction of tech-nical personnel in manufacturing are both correlated with lower likeli-hood of a critical-to-quality defect at the commercial scale. It is possible that greater emphasis on quality is demonstrated by frac-tion of personnel in QA compared with an emphasis on execution dem-onstrated by fraction of personnel in manufacturing. Further investigation in this area and clarity regarding the expectations of technical personnel roles could provide greater insight into this observation. Although there were 11 variables significantly correlated with likeli-hood of a critical-to-quality defect at the commercial scale, there were also 45 variables found not to be so. Several of these variables are notable as not having been found to correlate with critical-to-quality defects at the commercial scale, including:t\u0001\u0001Type of product (e.g., protein, anti- body). t\u0001 Mode of production (e.g., mamma- lian, microbial ). t\u0001 Level of production complexity per- ceived by the site: The first three variables are related to perceived manufacturing complexity and logic could suggest that a depen-dence is expected, but has not been found in the current data. t\u0001\u0001 Use of QbD: QbD can take on many forms and has a complex impact on measured quality performance metrics. Generally, this lack of cor-relation is notable as quality by design is expected to increase the likelihood of product with consis-tent quality over time (3). t\u0001\u0001Number of product batches manu- factured in the past five years: More batches would be expected to increase probability of a single defect occurring but is logically counteracted by familiarity with the product and the possibility of increased learning from completed batches (4). CONCLUSION With the intent of increasing understanding of variables asso-ciated with commercial quality performance of individual biophar-maceutical products, a survey was conducted with questions related to the product lifecycle and site characteristics. The interim analy-sis presented here was based on 34 products across 11 sites with diverse characteristics. The analysis focused on determin- ing which product or site variables were statistically more likely to be present for products that have expe-rienced a critical-to-quality defect at the commercial scale. The themes of variables found to be statistically significant based on the likelihood analysis the site (particularly employed in QA and employed in manufacturing ) A number of themes not found to be statistically significant for asso-ciation with commercial critical-to-quality defects, based on the data available, five years at the com-mercial scale.

In March 2012, B VGH, in conjunction with the Biotechnology Industry Organizaton (BIO) released a report, Developing New Drugs and Vaccines for Neglected Diseases of the Poor: The Product Developer Landscape , which included information about of the industry's participation in R&D for neglected diseases at the global level (1). The report showed that small- to medium-sized biotechnology companies are par-ticipating in a high percentage (41%) of projects targeting neglected diseases of the developing world. The findings of this report were surprising, given the financial risks these companies take on and the little to no promise of a return on their R&D investment. Intrigued by the level of participation already among industry and stakehold-ers, BVGH joined forces with BIO to learn more about the biotech sector and its contributions to neglected-disease prod-uct development across drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. Using updated prod-uct development data from the B VGH Global Health Primer, B VGH and BIO have authored a new report, Biotechnology: Bringing Innovation to Neglected Disease Research and Development , which not only reinforces the findings of the March Product Developer Landscape, but also sheds light on the mechanisms driving biotech participation in global health and makes recommendations for fully leverag-ing the innovation emerging from the biotech sector (2). Bringing Innovation to Neglected Disease Research and DevelopmentR&D BIOVENTURES FOR GLO BAL HEALTH October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 57The following sections highlight the report's key findings and are based on the full B VGH and BIO report snapshot. CURRENT INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT The following points summarize the work the biotech industry is cur-rently doing in neglected disease R&D: Partnering is an important driver. Sixty-four percent of all products in development by bio-technology companies across the pipeline of drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics for neglected diseases involve partnering. Product development partnerships (PDPs) and government agencies are driving biotechnology company part-nering for neglected diseases. PDPs are a unique public-private partnering mechanism to increase biopharma-ceutical participation in neglected disease R&D. Biotechnology compa-nies partner with academia, PDPs, government agencies, and other industry, to advance neglected dis-ease R&D projects. PDPs are the second most frequent partner, after academia\u2014PDPs are involved in 52% of partnered projects. When a PDP is not involved in a project, biotechnology-government partner-ships increase, especially for vaccines and diagnostics. For tuberculosis and dengue fever, biotechnology companies are often working independently. Across all neglected diseases, biotechnology companies work alone 36 % of the time. For tuberculosis, 49 % of proj- ects are conducted alone and for dengue, 53 % o f p r o j ects are co m- pleted alone. Companies more fre-quently overcome barriers and leverage some market potential to work alone. For the other neglected diseases tha t ha v e li ttl e o r n o mar -ket, such as leishmaniasis, African sleeping sickness, and Chagas dis-ease, biotechnology companies can take advantage of strategic partner-ships to increase their participation. Working alone is not encouraged per se , but this observation is aligned with the idea that the market bar-rier is significant for many of the neglected diseases that suffer from an insufficient market. As noted in the report, products for tuberculosis and dengue fever may have some return on invest-ment, especially in the private sector of emerging market countries based on demand and market analyses, which may allow the company to pursue the opportunity without partners. PROPOSED FUTURE COMMITMENT AND INVESTMENT The following points summarize the proposals of B VGH and BIO going forward in terms of continued work among the industry and stakehold- ers in neglected disease R&D: For companies t\u0001 Increase R&D participation in partnering mechanisms and seek collaboration opportunities. t\u0001 Pursue partnerships as a way to access non-dilutive financing to engage in global health R&D. t\u0001 Seek out existing incentives and innovative financing mechanisms that are available to companies working in neglected diseases. t\u0001Expand R&D efforts beyond HI V, malaria, tuberculosis, dengue fever, and leishmaniasis to other neglected diseases. t\u0001 Invite key global health stakeholders to industry events and meetings to increase the neglected disease dialogue in traditional biotechnology circles. For stakeholders (academia , gov- ernments , nonprofits , foundations) t\u0001 Actively target small to medium- sized biotechnology companies through existing industry engagement initiatives to increase engagement with the sector. t\u0001 Continue to fund existing part- nering mechanisms, such as PDPs, and increase specific targeting of biotech for participation. t\u0001#SJOH\u0001GPSUI \u0001OFX\u0001GJOBODJBM \u0001JODFO - tive proposals that specifi-cally meet the needs of small to medium-sized biotechnology companies and that have the endorsement and buy-in of the biotechnology sector. t\u0001 Continue support of existing incentives and collaboration mechanisms, such as the FDA Priority Review Voucher, Orphan Dru g A ct , an d WIPO R e :Search programs, that are compatible with biotechnology company participation. t\u0001Engage the biotechnology sector leadership at the highest level by involving C EOs and top executives. CONCLUSION Data sets and figures aside, the most important finding of this report is not necessarily what has been accomplishd to date, but ra th er w ha t is poss i b l e m o ving forward. To begin to solve the unmet needs of the developing world, both biotechnology com-panies and global health groups must ramp up commitment and involvement and seek to engage each other through partnerships.The biotech sector's capacity for innovation, not to mention will- ingness to take financial risks, is incredibly encouraging. But with only 5 % of all biotechnology companies involved in neglected disease R&D, imagine what engaging the other 95 % could accomplish. REFERENCES 1.

ImagesInside USP Adverse health events associated with the use of adulterated or counterfeit heparin prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and FDA to begin a nationwide investigation in January 2008 of the commonly used blood-thinning drug. FDA confirmed that serious injuries and deaths had been associated with the use of heparin manu-factured with an API sourced from China (1). During this investigation, FDA scientists also identified a previously unknown contami-nant, oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS), in the heparin (2). Working with FDA, manufacturers, and other stakeholders, the US Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) responded to this public health crisis by embarking on a revision of its public quality standards for heparin to enable the identification of OSCS and related contaminants. USP, a scientific nonprofit organization, develops standards that test for the identity, strength, quality, and purity of medicines, including biologic drugs like heparin. Published in its compendia, US Pharmacopeia dards (i.e., monographs ) are developed for individual drugs and their ingredients. MONOGRAPH REVISONS\u2014BACKGROUND Since 2008, revisions of the heparin stan-dards have taken place in three stages in order to better protect the US supply in a timely manner and help prevent future adulteration (see Table I ). To address the imme- diate public health risk posed in 2008, Stage 1 monograph revisions consisted of validating and imple-menting proton at FDA to detect OSCS. Stage 2 monograph revisions included new identification, potency, and impurity tests to better control the quality of heparin API (3). The Stage 2 revised heparin monographs became official on October 1, 2009 (4). Stage 3 revisions focus on further optimi- zation of identification tests and a protein impurities procedure as well as the intro-duction of brand new molecular weight determination and nucleotidic impurities procedures. To decide on specifications for the new molecular weight determination and impurities tests, USP engaged stakehold-ers in two round-robin studies. The stud-i es w ere des ign ed t o g a th er f eedba ck o n th e proposed procedures prior to their publica-tion in Pharmacopeial Forum \u2014USP's free- access, online publication for posting and receiving public comments on standards in development. Round-robin participants were requested to test their in-house heparin API batches using the proposed procedures. Final acceptance criteria for the tests were based on the batch data received during the studies. HEPARIN SODIUM MONOGRAPH STAGE \u2014 SPECIFICS Immediately after the implementation of the Stage 2-revised Heparin Sodium monograph, USP collaborated with stakeholders and FDA Anita Y.

USP collaborated with stake- holders and FDA to further standard.October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm further strengthen the stan- dard and help ensure continued access to heparin of good and acceptable quality. USP's third stage of revisions aimed to opti-mize and reinforce the Heparin Sodium monograph against OSCS and process impurities. The USP Unfractionated Heparin Expert Panel played a crucial role in modernizing the Heparin Sodium monograph and updating the associated specifications. The panel con-sists of industry, academic, and regulatory experts from around the world and is advisory to USP's Monographs\u2014Biologics & Biotechnology 1 Expert Committee (Monographs-BB1 EC), which is responsible for establishing and updating hepa-rin standards and is part of USP's Council of Experts. With FDA input, panel members reviewed submissions regarding new and improved analytical procedures for the characterization of hepa-rin. These procedures first were evaluated for suitability as com-pendial methods; when needed, further validation work was car-ried out. Identification. Public feedback on the Stage 2 1H NMR procedure generally was positive, but com-menters did recommend minor modifications to the experimen-tal procedure. These include the option of adding ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), reduced trimethylsilylpropionic acid sodium salt (TSP) concen- tration in a sample solution, as well as adjustments to the temperature range, acquisition time, and longer delay time. The major change was the reduced percentage\u20140.3 % (w/w) instead of 1% (w/w)\u2014of OSCS in system suitability solution to ensure a higher sensitivity of the method for OSCS. Also based on public com- ments, the expert panel opti-mized and validated an improved anion-exchange high-perfor- mance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure that provides a shorter run time, higher res-olution between heparin and dermatan sulfate, and improved sensitivity for impurities. The third identification test that has been introduced is molecular weight determina-tions. The molecular weight profile of heparin is an intrin-sic property that depends on the starting material and the manu-facturing process. The resulting molecular weight distribution of finished heparin API in turn influences its potency, its ease of neutralization by protamine sulfate, and its propensity to i n t e r a c t w i t h p l a s m a p r o t e i n s (e.g., platelet factor 4, leading to heparin-induced thrombocytope-nia [HIT] ). Therefore, the mole- cular weight distribution of hep-arin API could be used to ensure Continued on p. 63Table I: Changes to heparin sodium monograph during Stage 1 through Stage 3 revisions.

Meeting Challenges for Analysis of Antibody-Drug Conjugates The complex structure of ADCs necessitates different analytical strategies than those for either small molecules or unconjugated monoclonal antibodies. Chemotherapy is a mainstay of a standardized treatment regimen for cancer. However, the nonspecific tar- geting of healthy cells as well as tumor cells by cytotoxic small-molecule drugs often results in intolerable side effects. These side effects compromise the effi-cacy of the treatment regimen and dramatically decrease the quality of life for cancer patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a new class of che- motherapeutics which comprise monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that selectively tumor-associated antigens associated with a cytotoxic small-molecule pay-load (1). The payload is attached to the antibody using enzyme-cleavable linkers. Much effort has been made to identify the highly tumor-specific mAbs, anticancer drugs with the maximum efficacy, and linkers that are stable in cir- culation but allow for rapid cleav-age to release the cell-killing drugs following intracellular uptake of the ADCs. More than 30 targets have been investigated and more than 20 ADCs are now in various phases of clinical development, including Trastuzumab-DM1 (Roche), SGN-35 ). Given th e high co m p l exi ty o f ADCs resul ting fro m the addition of the drug payload to already complex antibodies, the development and validation of analytical methods for ADC characterization, formulation analysis, and bioanalysis present significant challenges. A comprehensive review of bioanalytical assays for ADCs was published by Stephan et al. (2). In the current discussion, attention is focused on the development of bioan-alytical assays for ADCs from a preclinical perspective. ASSAY FORMATS FOR PHARMACOKINETIC METHODS The ADC is a heterogeneous mixture con- taining a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies with different drug payloads. Because of this heterogeneous nature, ligand binding assays (LBAs) are generally used for ADC bioanaly- sis. A variety of platforms are used, including immunosorbent assay, compact-disk, Total antibody assays can be used to quantify total antibody with or without the cytotoxic drug conjugated with streptavidin-HRP, are then used for detection (see Figure 1 ). To eliminate nonspecific binding, mon- key adsorbed anti-human IgG antibodies are commonly used for nonhuman primate studies. Depending on the type of linkers, Yi Qun Xiao, PhD , is director of immunology, Andreea Halford is senior manager of ligand binding assay development, and Roger N. Hayes, PhD, is vice-president and general manager of laboratory sciences, all at MPI Research, 54943 North Main Street, Mattawan, MI, 49071.October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 61Bioanalytical Best PracticesALL FIGUR ES ARE COURTESY OF THE AUTHORSthe position of drug conjugation may be located on (Fab')2, or the hinge region of the carrier anti-bodies. Increasing stoichiometry of drug conjugation may affect the binding of the ADCs to cap-ture or detection reagents, and significantly affect the assay per-formance. Moreover, some assay formats are sensitive to the drug l oa d ev en th o u gh th e b in din g sites are not directly blocked. It has been reported that differ-ent assay formats yield different pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and markedly affect the calcu-lation of critical PK parameters such as clearance and drug expo-sure (3). It appears that most of the assay formats are drug-load sensitive, but the generic human IgG assay using anti-human IgG (Fc) for capture and detection is an exception to this observation. For conjugated antibody LBAs, the anticytotoxic drug antibod-ies are used as capture or detec-tion reagents paired with the capture and detection reagents outlined above to measure the antibody which conjugates at least one drug (see Figure 2 ). The merit of conjugated anti- body assays is their ability to quantify the possible progressive l oss o f dru g fro m th e ADCs in circulation. However, extra cau-tion should be taken with the format using antidrug antibodies for detection because the drug l oa d o f ADCs migh t chang e in vivo, compared with the ADC standard material used for the assays. A successful design of an ADC is a combination of high drug-linker stability in circulation with efficient intratumoral cyto-toxic drug release. Significant achievements have been made in the past years to develop more stable linkers (4). However, the nonspecific release of drug from the carrier antibody in circulation is still a crucial fac- tor in determining the half-life of ADCs. To measure the drug moieties that have been released from the carrier antibody (i.e., free drug ), a competitive LBA for- mat could be used with antidrug antibodies coated for capture and a constant concentration of HRP-drug as the reporter (see Figure 3 ). Because the clearance of free drug released from the ADC is much faster than the clear-ance of the ADC itself, the free drug might not be detectable. To solve this problem, one could measure the remaining drug - Anti-human lgG (Fc) antibody lgG (Fab') 2 antibody - Tumor-associated antigen Antibody drug - conjugate - LBA plate- Anti-Idiotype antibodyFigure 1: Example of total antibody assays. - Anti-cytotoxic drug antibody - Tumor-associated antigen Antibody lgG (Fc) Anti-human lgG 2: conjugated antibody assays.62 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com October 2012Bioanalytical Best Practices that is bound to the ADC. This measurement can be achieved through the use of cathepsin B digestion to release the drug pre-viously bound to the carrier anti-body, followed by quantification of the free drug either via a com-petitive LBA assay or LC-MS. Ideally, the assay methods for nonclinical PK bioanalysis should be developed during the early stages of ADC development and characterization. Evaluating the assays could be done with the recovery of enriched or puri-fied drug antibody ratio (DAR) fractions compared with the average DAR standard to ensure that the different assay formats recover drug equally. If this analysis is not possible, detailed information of the ADC's mecha-nism of action, targeted tumor antigen, type of linker, drug antibody ratio, cytotoxic drug, and so forth, are necessary for the bioanalytical method design. In addition to LBA methods, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), HPLC, and LC-MS are being used to quantify ADCs. These methods, however, are beyond the scope of the current discussion and are reported elsewhere (1, 3, 4 ).IMMUNOGENICITY OF ADCS Although the same methods used for determining the immuno-genicity of general therapeutic antibodies can be used to deter-mine the immunogenicity of ADCs, further characterization of anti-ADC antibodies for the targeting antibody, the linker, and the drug components are required to address the speci-fi ci ty o f pos i ti v e sam p l es. Th e complexity of the ADC structure raises additional questions not previously encountered in the analysis of monoclonal antibody therapeutics or small molecule drugs. For instance, does an anti-body response against the linker or the cytotoxic drug affect ADC internalization? Alternatively, do only neutralizing antibod-ies against the complementarity determining region (CDR) of the targeting antibody reduce the efficacy of the ADC? MATRIX SELECTION Antibodies are commonly recog-nized as stable; therefore, most bioanalytical assays for thera-peutical monoclonal antibodies are established in serum. This blanket approach, however, is not appropriate for the bioanaly-sis of ADCs where the conjuga- tion of small molecule drug to the antibody via a linker creates a molecule whose overall stabil-ity depends upon the least stable of the three components. To this end, plasma is suggested as being the preferred matrix used for PK and immunogenicity sample analysis because the inhibition of the clotting cascade in plasma results in much less proteolysis than in serum. Moreover, prote-ase inhibitors could be added dur-ing sample collection to further stabilize the ADCs in plasma. CRITICAL REAGENTS The LBA has been the primary analysis platform used for ADC bioanalysis because of its many advantages, including the abil-ity to measure the test article in matrix without further sample extraction, its high-through-put nature, the broad dynamic range and high sensitivity that can be achieved, and the requirement of minimal sample volume. However, the availabil-ity of critical reagents is a key component to the development of highly specific and sensi-tive LBA methods. Much time and effort is usually taken to create anti-idiotype antibodies against the carrier antibody or the cytotoxic drug. Because of the low immunogenic nature of cytotoxic drugs, conjugation with keyhole limpet hemocya-nin (KLH) o r an a d j u van t ma y be required for antibody cre-ation. The tight timelines for most IND-enabling studies necessitate early planning dur-ing the design of bioanalytical assays that factors in the time-lines for generation of critical reagents. These critical reagents are either prepared in-house or subcontracted to third parties, and at least six months lead time is typically required. Antibody - LBA plate Cytotoxic drug - - Cytotoxic drug-HRP - Anti-cytotoxic drug antibody - LBA plateFigure 3: Competitive LBA for free drug.October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 63Bioanalytical Best Practices screening, assay format testing, and reagent purification are all steps that are part of the reagent-generation process that will add even more time, cost, and risk to projects. In some instances, the anticarrier anti-bodies and targeted antigens may be commercially available. In th e s e cas e s , i t i s cru ci al t o secure sufficient quantities of the lot so that the reagent inventory can cover the entire study. Communication and establishing a good relation-ship with the reagent vendors are important and should be a key consideration. Should differ-ent reagent lots be used through- out the study, an appropriate way of assessing and bridging the different reagent lots must be established and implemented. CONCLUSION As ADC technology has become increasingly prevalent, it is imperative that new and reliable methods are developed to bet-ter characterize different ADCs both in vitro and in vivo . Because of the complexity of ADCs, many LBA formats are available for the same bioanalytical purpose. Therefore, caution has to be taken during assay development and validation to ensure that the selected method is the best fit for a given compound. The criti-cal reagents are crucial factors for LBAs; therefore, sufficient lead time and effort must be fac-tored into meeting project mile-stones. REFERENCES 1. A. Wakankar, Y. Gokarn, and F.

Moisture Matters in Lyophilized Drug Product Using an alternate moisture-generation method may provide more accurate data for regulatory submissions. Lyophilization, or freeze-drying, is a pro- cess by which a drug formulation is first frozen and then the ice is removed by sublimation under a vacuum. For a lyophilized drug product, the residual moisture specifica-tion is a crucial component of the data pack-age for regulatory filing. A defined acceptable range of water content also provides flexibility in the manufacturing process. Such data are usually generated by assessing product stabil-ity at various moisture levels. The moisture content of the product vial in stability studies is usually inferred from that determined for sister vials. Such an approach raises two concerns. First, the moisture content of the vial in the stability study potentially may not be identical to the reference sister vials due to vial-to-vial variability, and there-fore, may be imprecise for resolving stability issues. Second, moisture levels in the product being ana- lyzed are usually generated by sorption of water (via exposure or equilibration ) onto a previously highly dried sample, whereas the moisture in an actual product results from incomplete desorption (during freeze-drying ). Further data m us t be o btain ed t o j us tify tha t each individual product stability is the same no matter which method is used to introduce moisture, due to the unique properties of each product being evaluated. PROPOSED APPROACH FOR MOISTURE GENERATION WHEN FREEZE-DRYING The approach proposed here addresses both concerns by gener-ating moisture in situ from freeze-drying and by ascertaining the actual moisture content of the vials being analyzed for stability. Conventional method (ex-situ) In a conventional method of generating residual moisture (i.e., ex-situ ), samples are placed in a humidity chamber at a set tem-perature and a set relative humidity (RH) (e.g., 40 \u00b0C /60% RH) to allow subject materi- als to adsorb various amounts of moisture (1). An alternative is to pre-equilibrate samples at discrete RH values (2). Weighed samples in open vials are placed in desiccators with CaSO4 (Drierite ) or saturated salt solutions to situ) Two runs of lyocycle (of identical set-up ) are proposed. Twelve 20-m L vials are filled with a fixed volume of a protein drug formulation so that the final lyophilized product (the cake ) weighs approximately 0.4-0.6 g. Four vials are placed on each of the three shelves in the lyophilizer. Lyophilization is performed by freezing the sample and subsequently sublim-ing ice from the frozen content at a tempera-ture suitable for primary (1 0) drying. Primary drying is continued until the Pirani pressure readout deceases to the pressure level (e.g., 100 mTorr ) of the capacitance manometer (CM) when the secondary (2 0) drying begins. Vials on each shelf are stoppered sequentially at approximately 1-3 h intervals between the end of 1 0 drying and the beginning of 20 drying. Each cake is split into 6 pre-weighed 5-m L vials in a glove bag where a low RH (< 2%) is maintained by flushing with dry nitro-Leu-Fen Lin, PhD, is a senior manager, Formulation Development, and Richard Bunnell, PhD, is general manager, both at SGS Life Science Services, 616 Heathrow Drive, Lincolnshire, IL 60069, tel. 847.821.8900, leufen.lin@sgs.com and CASTTM 73 ,089 eNewsletter Universe .......................................... 92,679 Total Print Magazine an d eNewsletter Universe ......114,333* Pharma ceutical Science Conference Attendees......

On e vial fro m ea ch cak e is ana-lyzed for moisture content by Karl Fisher (KF) titrator con- n e c t e d t o a K F T h e r m o p r e p (oven, Metrohm ) equipped with an adaptor for the 5-m L vials. An example of the analysis for a protein drug product is shown in Table I . Aside from the expected shelf- to-shelf differences in moisture content (since each shelf was stoppered at different times ), there was also substantial vial-to-vial variability among vials o n t h e s a m e s h e l f , m a i n l y because those vials were stop-pered when sublimation was still in dynamic process and the system was not in equilibrium. These data guide the second lyo-cycle run (with additional 12 drug formulation-filled vials ) in which one can better gauge when to stopper the vials to obtain cakes complementary to those from the first run so that the full range of 0.1-7.0 % mois- ture levels can be obtained (see Table I ). From the two lyocycle runs, eight groups of the 5-m L vials, each contains ~1 /6 of the cake with known moisture contents (italicized in Tables I and II ), are selected for stability studies. One vial from each group is the t=0 sample, while the remaining 4 vials from each are incubated at accelerated temperatures for pre-determined time periods (e.g., 50 \u00b0C for 2 weeks and 4 weeks; 40 \u00b0C for 3 months; and 25 \u00b0C for 24 months ) and analyzed by the stability-indicating assay upon reconstitution. Stability data using the above approach with two different pro-tein drug products are shown in Figure 1 . The major degra- dation route for both proteins upon lyophilization was aggrega-tion; therefore, protein stability was assessed by size exclusion high-performance liquid chro-matography (SE-HPLC) to mea- sure the recovery of intact native protein (% native ).

However, the 50 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C storage stability decreased when the residual moisture was 3.6%. Results in Figure 1a suggest that the moisture specification can be set at 3 % for this protein drug product. Stability data using the same approach with a second pro-tein drug product is shown in Figure 1b . The results suggested a moisture specification of 2.7% is appropriate for this drug product. DISCUSSION A few technical points are worth mentioning. First, for easier transfer of the divided cake /pow- der in the glove bag, vials with an opening of 20 mm (for a 5-m L vial or a 6-m L o v en vial fr o m Metrohm ) i n s t e a d o f 1 3 m m (for 2- or 3-m L vials) are recom- mended. Second, before performing the actual experiment, one should test the system suitability by selecting at least two cakes with high and low moisture levels (at > 3% and < 1 %, respectively ) and perform moisture analysis on all six vials from each cake. The per-centage of moisture should be identical (o r wi th v ery l o w rela- tive standard deviation ) for all the replicates. Third, during a real experi- ment, one can also include vials / samples with very close moisture content for an accelerated stabil-ity study. An observation that the accelerated stabilities are extremely close for samples with similar moisture levels will rein-force the confidence that one is on the right track. Finally, it is possible that, with extensive product knowledge and process understanding, one can, in a single lyocycle run, achieve cakes with all the desir-able spread of moisture contents (between 0.1-7.0 %). Therefore, it is not always necessary to per-f o r m t w o l y o c y c l e r u n s w h e n using the proposed approach. There is no need for large amounts of product or sophis-ticated equipment. In addition, generating residual moisture in situ offers a more realistic simulation of an actual freeze-drying run in drug produc-tion. Furthermore, the residual moisture of each product vial incubated at accelerated temper-atures for predetermined time periods (i.e., in storage stability study) can be measured directly and therefore can be considered more accurate than that inferred from sister vials. Thus, ambigu-ity in stability studies can be reduced. CONCLUSION When manufacturing lyophi-lized drug product, the conven-ti o nal wisd o m is t o aim f o r n o more than 1 % residual moisture. Based on the approach outlined here, the moisture specification for two different protein drug products was 3.0 % and 2.7 %, respectively, thereby providing for a higher margin than the conventional 1 % residual mois- ture for lyophilized drug prod-ucts. Information generated using this approach can help to strengthen one's data package to support specifications for regula-tory filings and manufacturing ranges. REFERENCES 1. E.D. Breen et al., Pharm.

PREPARATION AND PURIFICATION BioPharm: Downstream processing is largely co ns i d ered th e seco n d half o f a typ i cal b i o-pharmaceutical manufacturing process. What are the typical steps involved in the downstream process? Nelligan: The steps that biopharma manu- facturers rely on for downstream processing are quite well established. A typical biophar- maceutial process uses three chromatographic column steps, each preceded by ultra filtration / diafiltration (UF/DF) of product. Each UF /DF pretreatment step is necessary to prepare the product for the following chromatogra-phy stage because all columns operate under differing pH or molarity conditions. Basically, the product needs to be primed for chromatography use before-hand. UF /DF concentrates and resuspends the product in the co rrect buff er bef o re i t is p la ced into the columns, making for a faster and more efficient process In a typical three-stage downstream purifi- cation process, the strategy is as follows: \u0001B\u0001DBQUVSF\u0001QIBTF \u0001JT\u0001VTFE\u0001UP\u0001JTPMBUF \u0001 concentrate, and stabilize the target prod-uct. This capture phase must be achieved q ui ckl y .

Ian Nelligan is the Technical and Training Director at the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training (NIBRT) in Dublin. October 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 69Boot Camp: Tech Guide CHROMATOGRAPHY BioPharm: What are the major challenges associated with the chromatography? Nelligan: Yes, there are com- mon challenges. For instance, the gel or resin used to recover and purify product can deteri-orate with time; its activity is lost as the gel is recycled mul-tiple times to maximize use. The gel is often made of tiny beads (a few microns in diam- eter) that tend to compress when packed. If too much pressure is applied, the beads in the gel can collapse, thereby producing small fragments or fines. Liquid flow through the columns is restricted by these fragments. As a result, capacity and activity can be lost. A typical chroma-tography column can comprise man y h un dreds o f li t ers o f g el but the bed height is rather flat (approximately 20 cm ). Therefore, columns are shallow but wide (e.g., 2 m ) to avoid over pressurization and compression of the resin beads. The proteins we make are very delicate. The conditions on the columns can lead to protein deg-radation if they are not managed properly. Consider, for example, an everyday egg, which happens to be a protein covered in a hard shell for protection. If we shake the egg too much, it deforms. The process is irreversible. Biopharmaceutical products are just as friable as the egg example. If we agitate a protein too much, expose it to air for too long, or fail to store it at the correct temperature, the protein can degrade and product loss can occur. At the end of a typical downstream process, the protein yield is often down to 60 % of the starting concentration (i.e. for every kilogram processed, 40% is lost ). Even though the industry spends a lot of time try-ing to optimize their processes to be efficient, these losses are dif- ficult to recover. BEST PRACTICES BioPharm: Can you offer any best practices for embarking on a downstream manufacturing pro-cess overall? Nelligan: Be o pen t o chan g e . The industry today is like the computer industry of the 1970s\u2014we have seen a boom in technol-ogy that is not slowing down. Our knowledge about how to best complete bioprocessing steps increases day to day, and that knowledge is constantly being transferred into operations. Every day, we see new equipment arrive, better equipment, cheaper equipment\u2014there are all sorts of innovations happening. In the industry today, there is a huge worldwide demand for therapeutic protein drugs that is showing double digit growth. A lot of money is being invested in the industry in new products and processes, and at the same time, there is a drive to reduce cost, to improve productivity, and to become more efficient. We have passed the stage where, perhaps five or six years ago, it was important to make drugs at any price because they were so important. Now the goal is to make them as inexpensively and efficiently as possible. The cost of goods is becom- ing more and more important, especially when trying to break into new markets. Customers are demanding that the price of biopharmaceutical products is reduced and better technology and more automated processes are developed to enable this. These are the pressures we face in the biopharmaceutical indus-try. The objective is to make more powerful, more affordable drug products going forward.

The sci- entists claimed that FDA senior managers in CDRH and the FDA Commissioner were corrupt and incompetent (1, 2). The scientists reportedly publicly disclosed com-pany confidential, commercial, trade secret information to the media in airing their concerns regarding the decisions made to approve or clear certain medical devices for marketing (1, 2). It is sur- prising and disturbing that the FDA scientific reviewers leaked confiden-tial commercial information to the press. FDA regulations are clear: if the existence of a premarket submis-sion has not been publicly disclosed and the submitter requests that the intent to market a device remain confidential, provides a certifica-tion to the Commissioner request-ing confidentiality, and complies with various provisions regarding the maintenance of such confiden-tiality, then FDA will not disclose the existence of a premarket noti-fication. This relates to existence and the intent to market a medi-cal device, which is evident by the submission of a 510 (k) application. There are similar confidentiality provisions relating to investiga-tional products, full and abbreviated new drug applications, biologic license applications, and premar-ket approval applications. The news media has reported not only the existence of the companies intent to market certain medical devices but appears to have received inter- nal agency files, documents, and confidential commercial informa- tion from FDA reviewers (1, 2). It is disturbing that an FDA contractor also apparently inadvertently made accessible over its website a signifi- cant amount of sensitive FDA docu-ments (1, 2). Companies spend huge amounts of money generating data to sup- port the approval of pharmaceu-ticals, biologics, and medical devices. Companies expect that FDA will keep this information confidential and will not disclose it to competitors or to the public while the review process is ongoing. Disclosure of confidential informa-tion prior to a company receiving marketing approval or clearance can cause significant economic harm. Competitors can get advance notice of the products under review and adjust their marketing plans for competing products. Competitors may also use this information to further develop their own products. FDA staff, outside contractors, special government employees, advisory committee members, and others who have access to com-pany confidential, commercial, and trade-secret information must take their obligation to keep such information confidential seri-ously. FDA staff and others should not make the decision to disclose confidential information to the media just because they may dis-agree with or are challenging the scientific judgment of their supe-riors. FDA staff must follow the procedures established to present differing views of scientific data and the conclusions drawn with respect to safety and efficacy. If certain members of the FDA review staff disagree with the decision to approve or clear a product, they can document such objections in writing. If the review staff question the approval decision because they believe it was not supported by the clinical data, the public safety is at risk, the review process was com-promised, or that there was corrup-tion or incompetence uncovered during the review process, there are procedures that can be utilized to report such allegations. Staff can always raise concerns with internal management structure at FDA, Health and Human Services, the Office of Special Counsel, the President's staff, or through Congress. When raising the con- cerns up the chain of command, staff are well advised to present their allegations and documenta-tion to support their assertions in an organized, responsible manner. MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY As part of routine procedure, com-panies identify the parts of their submission (e.g., 510 (k), PMA, NDA, and ANDA ) that are considered con- fidential, commercial, trade secret information. Prior to approval or clearance, FDA is obligated to main-tain that confidentiality. How should the agency ensure this con-fidentiality? It has been suggested by the attorney representing the whistle blowers that FDA have dif-ferent computers and systems for maintaining confidential informa-tion that do not have, for example, Internet access. This is an expensive option; therefore, FDA staff should be trained and reminded on a peri-odic basis of their responsibility and obligation to maintain the confi-dentiality of submissions. If FDA staff members feel compelled to dis-cuss concerns with the media, they can have these discussions without disclosing confidential information. In closing, members of the FDA staff must understand and appreci-ate their obligation to maintain the confidentiality of submissions and not disclose confidential, commer- cial, trade secret information to the media. There must also be checks and balances on the review process. FDA staff should be aware of and follow procedures for raising scien- tific concerns that can impact the public health and safety. Ultimately, the public must continue to have confidence that FDA is making sound decisions on the approval and clearance of products. REFERENCES 1. S. Usdin, BioCentury, 20 (30), July 23, 2012. 2. E.

Continued from p. 7474 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com October 2012Final Word FDA and the Importance of Confidentiality Do you have to worry about FDA releasing confidential data? Apparently so. Recent news stories have reported that FDA scientists have been suspected of leaking confidential, commercial, and trade secret information to the media (1, 2). These scientists claim tha t fa ul ty revi ew p roced ures l ed t o th e clearance of medical devices that exposed patients to dangerous levels of radiation (1, 2). The sci- entists raised questions regarding the judgment and integrity of senior management officials in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH ). In investigating the suspected leaks, FDA monitored the emails of these scientists through the use of sophisticated software that captured the keystrokes, keywords, and phrases of numer-ous individuals (1, 2). During the course of this monitoring, it appears that FDA may have gone beyond the scope of the initial suspected leak of confidential information by looking at pro-tected information such as individuals' password- protected private emails, communications to Congressional staff and the US Office of Special Counsel, attorney and client communications, workplace grievances, and items protected by whistleblower statutes. A NEED FOR CHECKS AND BALANCES The Office of Special Counsel has found that the scientists' claims regarding the medical device review process were sufficiently valid to warrant a further investigation (1, 2). In taking a step back from the news stories, it can be agreed upon by those involved in the FDA review and approval processes that it is sound scientific and public po li cy t o ha v e ch ecks an d balan ces o n th e FD A review and approval process. FDA has internal procedures that permit and encourage the pre-sentation and discussion of the interpretation of scientific data. Expressing the differing views of the product review team leads to a thorough evaluation and discussion of the data and, ulti-mately, to better decision-making on the review and approval process for FDA-regulated products. Various positions regarding the interpretation of the data are discussed in a forum at FDA where the exchange of differing views on safety and efficacy data are presented to an experienced team of senior FDA staff. There is an opportunity for all team members involved to present their analysis and views on the risks verses benefits of products. Invariably, disagreements as whether the benefit of the product is acceptable in light of the risks may occur. In the end, FDA must make a decision as to the acceptability of the data and whether the appli-cation can be cleared or approved for marketing. Ultimately, FDA senior management must weigh the scientific evidence and exercise their judgment and experience in making decisions on whether the data support the clearance or approval application. The American public puts its faith in processes and relies on the belief that FDA scientists and senior management review products and make decisions on the acceptability of the data. In my 30-plus years of experience in dealing with FDA-regulated products (including more than 14 years at FDA ), I can personally attest to the fact that FDA staff take their responsibility for the review and approval of products seriously and work diligently to make decisions that are in the best interest of public health and safety.
