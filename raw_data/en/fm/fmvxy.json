It also refers to a form of health care, based on a theory of energetic physiology that describes and explains the interrelationship of the body organs or functions with an associated acupuncture point or combination of points located on \"channels\" or \"meridians\". Acupuncture points shall include the classical points defined in authoritative acupuncture texts and special groupings of acupuncture points elicited using generally accepted diagnostic techniques of eastern medicine and selected for stimulation in accord with its principles and practices. Acupuncture points are stimulated in order to restore the normal function of the aforementioned organs or sets of functions. Acupuncture shall also include the ancillary techniques of eastern medicine including moxibustion, acupressure or other forms of manual meridian therapy and recommendations that include eastern dietary therapy, supplements and lifestyle modifications. (2) \"Board\" means the Board of Medical Licensure and Discipline. (3) \"Council\" means the Acupuncture Advisory Council. (4) \"Eastern medicine\" means the practice of acupuncture, Chinese herbology and Asian bodywork therapy as part of a comprehensive health-care system encompassing a variety of traditional health-care therapies that have been used for more than 3,000 years to diagnose and treat illness, prevent disease and improve well-being. (5) \"License\" means, unless the context requires otherwise, a license issued by the Board to practice acupuncture. (6) a. \"Practice of acupuncture\" means the use of needles with or without electrical stimulation for the purpose of normalizing energetic physiological functions including pain control, and for the promotion, maintenance, and restoration of health. b.

These needles shall only be used on an individual patient in a single treatment session and disposed of according to federal standards for biohazard waste. (7) \"Practice of eastern medicine\" includes the practice of acupuncture and further means making recommendations or prescriptions based in eastern dietary therapy, supplements and lifestyle modifications according to the principles of eastern medicine. Eastern dietary therapy shall be defined as recommending, advising or furnishing nonfraudulent information about herbs, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, carbohydrates, sugars, enzymes, food concentrates, foods, other food supplements, or dietary supplements. For purposes of this paragraph, \"fraud\" shall be defined as an intentional misrepresentation for financial gain. Legitimate disagreement about the role of the above-listed nutrients and foods as they apply to human nutrition shall not, in and of itself, constitute fraud. These supplemental techniques may be used within the public domain or by another licensed or registered healthcare or bodywork professional, according to state law or regulation. (b) Nothing in this subchapter shall limit, preclude, or otherwise interfere with the professional activities of other individuals and healthcare providers who are allowed to perform acupuncture.

(5) [Repealed.] (d) License denial. \u2014 If it appears to the Board that an applicant has been intentionally fraudulent or that an applicant has intentionally submitted, or intentionally caused to be submitted, false information as part of the application process, the Board may not issue a license to the applicant and must report the incident of fraud or submitting false information to the Office of the Attorney General for further action. (e) Temporary license. \u2014 The Executive Director of the Board, with the approval of a Council member, may issue a temporary permit to an applicant for licensure who has presented a completed application to the Board.

Unprofessional conduct includes, but is not limited to, fraud, deceit, incompetence, gross negligence, dishonesty, or other behavior in the licensee's professional activity which is likely to endanger the public health, safety, or welfare. The Council may recommend and Board may take necessary action against a licensee who is unable to render acupuncture or eastern medicine services with reasonable skill or safety to patients because of mental illness or mental incompetence, physical illness, or the excessive use of drugs including alcohol.

The Chair of the hearing panel shall be 1 of the Council panel members. (2) a. If the Board or the Acupuncture Advisory Council receives a formal or informal complaint concerning the activity of a licensee and the Board or Council members reasonably believe that the activity presents a clear and immediate danger to the public health, the Council may issue an order temporarily suspending the licensee's license to practice pending a hearing upon the written order of the Secretary of State or the Secretary's designee, with the concurrence of the Council Chair or the Chair's designee. An order temporarily suspending a license to practice may not be issued by the Board, unless the licensee or the licensee's attorney received at least 24 hours' written or oral notice prior to the temporary suspension so that the licensee or the licensee's attorney can be heard in opposition to the proposed suspension. An order of temporary suspension pending a hearing may remain in effect for no longer than 60 days from the date of the issuance of the order unless the temporarily suspended licensee requests a continuance of the hearing date. If the licensee requests a continuance, the order of temporary suspension remains in effect until the hearing panel convenes and a decision is rendered. b. A licensee whose license to practice has been temporarily suspended pursuant to this section must be notified of the temporary suspension immediately and in writing. Notification consists of a copy of the complaint and the order of temporary suspension pending a hearing personally served upon the licensee or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the licensee's last known address. c. A licensee whose license to practice has been temporarily suspended pursuant to this section may request an expedited hearing. The Council shall schedule the hearing on an expedited basis, provided that the Council receives the request within 5 calendar days from the date on which the licensee received notification of the decision of the Board, to temporarily suspend the licensee's license to practice. d. As soon as possible after the issuance of an order temporarily suspending a licensee's license to practice pending a hearing, the Council Chair shall appoint a 3-member hearing panel consisting of 3 members; 1 of the 3 shall be a physician member of the Board; 2 of the 3 shall be unbiased members of the Acupuncture Advisory Council; and if no conflict exists, 1 of the 2 Acupuncture Advisory Council members shall be the Chair of the Acupuncture Advisory Council. The Chair of the hearing panel shall be 1 of the Council panel members. After notice to the licensee pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)b. of this section, the hearing panel shall convene within 60 days of the date of the issuance of the order of temporary suspension to consider the evidence regarding the matters alleged in the complaint. If a licensee requests in a timely manner an expedited hearing, the hearing panel shall convene within 15 days of the receipt of the request by the Council. The 3-member panel shall proceed to a hearing and shall render a decision within 30 days of the hearing. e. In addition to making findings of fact, the hearing panel shall also determine whether the facts found by it constitute a clear and immediate danger to public health. If the hearing panel determines that the facts found constitute a clear and immediate danger to public health, the order of temporary suspension must remain in effect until the Board, deliberates and reaches conclusions of law based upon the findings of fact made by the hearing panel. An order of temporary suspension may not remain in effect for longer than 60 days from the date of the decision rendered by the hearing panel unless the suspended licensee requests an extension of the order pending a final decision of the Board. Upon the final decision of the Board, an order of temporary suspension is vacated as a matter of law and is replaced by the disciplinary action, if any, ordered by the Board. [76 Del.
