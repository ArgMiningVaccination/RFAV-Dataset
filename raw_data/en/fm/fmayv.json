The present review focuses on Alzheimer's disease (AD), since it is the most important cause of cognitive impairment. It is characterized by progressive memory loss, language deficits, depression, agitation, mood disturbances and psychosis. Although the hallmarks of AD are cholinergic dysfunction, -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle formation, it is also associated with derangement of other neurotransmitters, elevated levels of advanced glycation end products, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, genetic and environmental factors. On one hand, this complex etiopathology makes a response to commonly used drugs such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine less predictable and often unsatisfactory. On the other hand, it supports the use of herbal medicines due to their nonspecific antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and specific cholinesterase inhibitory activity. The popularity of herbal medicines is also increasing due to their perceived effectiveness, safety and affordability. In the present article, the experimental and clinical evidence have been reviewed for various Indian herbal medicines such as Centella asiatica, Bacopa monnieri, Curcuma longa, Clitoria ternatea, Withania somnifera, Celastrus paniculatus, Evolvulus alsinoides, Desmodium gangeticum, Eclipta alba, Moringa oleifera and Convolvulus pluricaulis, which have shown potential in cognitive impairment. Some commonly available herbal formulations for memory impairment in India have also been reviewed.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-12-10", "cleaned_text": "Indian Medicinal Herbs and Formulations for Alzheimer's Disease, from Traditional Knowledge to Scientific Assessment [https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci10120964](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci10120964) [Advances in Alzheimer's Disease: Where Do /journal/brainsci/special_issues/Alzheimer_Disease_2020 )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-brainsci-10-00964)]. A dysfunction in the process of acquisition/learning, retention or recall is known as dementia. Worldwide, about 40 million elderly are living with dementia [ [2](#B2-brainsci-10-00964), [3](#B3-brainsci-10-00964)]. In India, an estimated 3.7 million elderly people have dementia, and the prevalence is expected to increase two-fold by 2030 and three-fold by 2050 [ [4](#B4-brainsci-10-00964)]. Dementia is associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. This review is focused on the potential of herbal medicine in AD since it is responsible for more than two-thirds of all dementia cases [ [5](#B5-brainsci-10-00964), [6](#B6-brainsci-10-00964)]. [7](#B7-brainsci-10-00964)]. Currently available therapies for AD management are based on this hypothesis [ [8](#B8-brainsci-10-00964)]. The -amyloid hypothesis, most cogent hypothesis [ [9](#B9-brainsci-10-00964), [10](#B10-brainsci-10-00964), [11](#B11-brainsci-10-00964), [12](#B12-brainsci-10-00964)] provides the basis for development of new therapeutic strategies for AD treatment [ [13](#B13-brainsci-10-00964)]. The histopathological hallmarks of AD are neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation in the brain [ [14](#B14-brainsci-10-00964)]. Other associated factors that may also contribute to neurodegeneration in AD are elevated levels of advanced glycation end products, oxidative damage and neuroinflammation ( [Figure 1](#brainsci-10-00964-f001)). The involvement of free radicals and inflammation in pathogenesis of AD hint towards the possible role of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents as therapeutic tools [ [15](#B15-brainsci-10-00964)]. Studies have also reported that antioxidants protect against A induced neuronal toxicity [ [16](#B16-brainsci-10-00964), [17](#B17-brainsci-10-00964)]. Fuzhisan (FZS), a herbal drug, demonstrated a neuroprotective effect by inhibiting A (25-35)-induced activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5, calcium influx, calpain activation and tau hyperphosphorylation [ [18](#B18-brainsci-10-00964)]. Inhibitory effect of an aqueous extract of Ceylon cinnamon (C. zeylanicum) on tau aggregation and filament formation has also been reported [ [19](#B19-brainsci-10-00964)]. 2. Limitations of Currently Approved Cognition Enhancers [20](#B20-brainsci-10-00964)]. However, memantine is mainly recommended for moderate to severe AD cases [ [20](#B20-brainsci-10-00964)]. Cholinesterase inhibitors significantly improve the cognition in patients with mild to moderate AD but their efficacy for neuropsychiatric symptoms is still questionable. AD patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors experience adverse effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, etc. [ [21](#B21-brainsci-10-00964)]. The common adverse effects associated with AChE inhibitors are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and weight, though these can be minimized by slow dose escalation and administration with food. Other adverse effects of AChE inhibitors such as extrapyramidal symptoms, sleep disorder and cardiorespiratory adverse effects, are associated with central cholinergic over-activity whereas muscle cramps, weakness and urinary incontinence, are associated with peripheral cholinergic over-activity [ [22](#B22-brainsci-10-00964)]. These adverse effects are often dose limiting and disabling in nature. Further, AChE inhibitors do not address neuronal degeneration and associated changes in the brain. [23](#B23-brainsci-10-00964), [24](#B24-brainsci-10-00964)]. Studies indicate that antioxidants (vitamins E and C) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs slow the progression of AD [ [25](#B25-brainsci-10-00964), [26](#B26-brainsci-10-00964), [27](#B27-brainsci-10-00964), [28](#B28-brainsci-10-00964), [29](#B29-brainsci-10-00964), [30](#B30-brainsci-10-00964)]. Hormone replacement therapy has also been tried as a therapeutic strategy. Though it performed better than tacrine [ [31](#B31-brainsci-10-00964)], it is no longer recommended, as it may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and breast cancer [ [32](#B32-brainsci-10-00964)]. [33](#B33-brainsci-10-00964)]. It is currently being used in the treatment of moderate to severe AD. The rate of decline in behavioral and functional impairment in patients with moderate to severe AD is reduced by memantine [ [34](#B34-brainsci-10-00964)]. Patients taking memantine experience adverse effects like fatigue, pain, confusion, urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection, peripheral edema, etc. [ [35](#B35-brainsci-10-00964)]. Thus, the search continues for effective and affordable medicines, which when prescribed for long duration, have acceptable adverse effects or interaction with food and drugs and delay the progression or reverse the disease process. [Figure 2](#brainsci-10-00964-f002)) [ [19](#B19-brainsci-10-00964), [36](#B36-brainsci-10-00964)]. 3. Herbal Medicines for Alzheimer's Disease, Experimental and Clinical Evidence [37](#B37-brainsci-10-00964)]; and are also supported by clinical trials [ [38](#B38-brainsci-10-00964), [39](#B39-brainsci-10-00964)]. Bacopa monniera (water hyssop) has been used in the Indian Ayurvedic system to improve memory and intellectual functions as an immemorial custom. Centella asiatica (Asiatic pennywort), another Ayurvedic remedy, is given in combination with milk to improve memory [ [40](#B40-brainsci-10-00964)]. Withania somnifera root, a rejuvenative tonic, is also used in Ayurveda to enhance memory [ [41](#B41-brainsci-10-00964), [42](#B42-brainsci-10-00964)]. Herbal medicines are becoming popular due to their perceived effectiveness, safety and affordability. Indeed, only recently, scientific studies have started providing evidence and support for the use of herbal medicines in memory related disorders. [43](#B43-brainsci-10-00964), [44](#B44-brainsci-10-00964), [45](#B45-brainsci-10-00964), [46](#B46-brainsci-10-00964), [47](#B47-brainsci-10-00964), [48](#B48-brainsci-10-00964)]. A efficacy of a Gingko biloba extract and donepezil in AD patients with associated neuropsychiatric problems. The combination was reported to be superior to donepezil monotherapy in terms of both safety and efficacy [ [49](#B49-brainsci-10-00964)]. 3.1. Centella asiatica [50](#B50-brainsci-10-00964)]. The leaves of mandukparni have been used as a memory enhancer in the Ayurvedic system of medicine [ [51](#B51-brainsci-10-00964)]. Its use has also been described in the African system of medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine. It is used to delay ageing, prevent memory related disorders and is given with milk to enhance memory [ [40](#B40-brainsci-10-00964)]. [50](#B50-brainsci-10-00964)]. Other chemical compounds isolated from C. asiatica the extract for 21 days significantly reversed streptozotocin induced cognitive impairment [ [51](#B51-brainsci-10-00964)]. The authors attributed the beneficial effect of C. asiatica to antioxidant activity as evidenced by a decrease in malondialdehyde, increase in glutathione, catalase and superoxide dismutase levels. A study by Rao et al. [ [53](#B53-brainsci-10-00964)] demonstrated that 15 days treatment with C. asiatica at a dose of 200 mg/kg from day 15 to 30 postpartum stimulated learning and memory in rats, which lasted for at least 6 months postpartum. They also observed an increase in dendritic arborization of hippocampal CA3 neurons, which may be one reason for improvement in brain function. Another study showed improved cognitive outcome in elderly subjects following prescribed dose of 500 mg/b.i.d dried C. asiatica for a 6-month period [ [54](#B54-brainsci-10-00964)]. Dhanasekaran et al. [ [55](#B55-brainsci-10-00964)] found that an 8 month treatment with 2.5 mg/kg of aqueous extract of C. asiatica significantly decreased amyloid beta 1-40 and 1-42 levels in the hippocampus of PSAPP transgenic mice expressing \"Swedish\" amyloid precursor protein and M146L presenilin 1 mutations, which result in spontaneous amyloid beta plaque formation. A reduction in Congo red stained fibrillar amyloid plaques was detected on the long-term treatment with 5.0 mg/kg dose. [56](#B56-brainsci-10-00964)]. The leaf extract also had sedative, antidepressant and cholinomimetic activities [ [57](#B57-brainsci-10-00964)] suggesting its suitability for treatment of AD associated cognitive dysfunction and depression and anxiety. The leaf extract stimulated dendrites of neuronal cells in the rat brain [ [51](#B51-brainsci-10-00964)] and induced neurite elongation in human SH-SY-5Y cells and accelerated axonal regenerate in rats [ [58](#B58-brainsci-10-00964)]. Cyclic AMP response element binding property (CREB) and its phosphorylated form are involved in memory formation [ [59](#B59-brainsci-10-00964)]. Reduced level of phosphorylated CREB has been reported in AD patients and experimental models of AD [ [60](#B60-brainsci-10-00964)]. The aqueous extract of C. asiatica leaves enhanced phosphorylation of CREB in both neuroblastoma cells, which express inducible A\u00df and in cortical primary cells, which were chronically exposed to external A\u00df in-vitro. The extract increased neuronal Asiatic acid and its derivatives have shown a promising memory improving effect [ [65](#B65-brainsci-10-00964)] by improving ACh synthesis [ [66](#B66-brainsci-10-00964), [67](#B67-brainsci-10-00964)]. It has been patented (Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft) for the treatment of dementia and as a cognition enhancer. The exact constituent responsible for cognition enhancing effects of the herb remains to be established. However, studies suggest that perhaps triterpene saponins present in the leaf improve cognitive function by influencing central neurotransmitters. [68](#B68-brainsci-10-00964)]. [69](#B69-brainsci-10-00964)]. In acute toxicity study, C. asiatica extract up to 10 g/kg did not shown any sign of toxicity whereas in the subacute toxicity study, no toxicity was observed when the extract was administered at the doses of 10-1000 mg/kg. In the chronic toxicity study, doses up to 1200 mg/kg/day for six months did not result in significant toxicity in Wistar rats [ [70](#B70-brainsci-10-00964)]. However, in one study, oral administration of 1000 mg/kg/day dried C. asiatica for 30 days caused hepatotoxicity (a mixture of 2 saponins) may be responsible for its facilitatory effect on learning and memory. Besides, bacosides has been proven for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects [ [75](#B75-brainsci-10-00964)] bacosides also stress, electroconvulsive shock and scopolamine [ [76](#B76-brainsci-10-00964)]. They enhanced protein kinase activity and increased the protein content in the hippocampus, which may also contribute to their memory enhancing effect [ [74](#B74-brainsci-10-00964), [77](#B77-brainsci-10-00964), [78](#B78-brainsci-10-00964)]. Administration of bacosides (200 mg/kg) for 3 months in middle-aged and aged rats exerted a protective effect against age associated alterations in the neurotransmission system, behavioral paradigms, hippocampal neuronal loss and oxidative stress markers [ [79](#B79-brainsci-10-00964)]. The involvement of the microRNA 124-CREB pathway and serotonergic receptor in the memory enhancing mechanism of standardized extract of B. monniera (BESEB CDRI-08) has also been reported [ [80](#B80-brainsci-10-00964), [81](#B81-brainsci-10-00964)]. [47](#B47-brainsci-10-00964), [82](#B82-brainsci-10-00964)]. Besides, oral administration of 40 mg/kg/day of the Bacopa extract for 5 weeks prevented neurotoxicity in rats exposed to aluminum chloride [ [83](#B83-brainsci-10-00964)]. Cognitive deficit induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of cholchicine and ibotenic acid into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis was attenuated by standardized Bacopa extract by reversing the depletion of ACh level, reduction in choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) activity and decrease in muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding in frontal cortex and hippocampus [ [84](#B84-brainsci-10-00964)]. Holcomb et al. [ [43](#B43-brainsci-10-00964)] reported that administration of ethanolic extract of Bacopa leaves at doses of 40 and 160 mg/kg for 2 and 8 months reduced A 1-40 and 1-42 levels in the cortex of PSAPP mice. Bacopa, at the dose of 50 mg/kg, demonstrated the neuroprotective effect in the colchicine model of dementia through its antioxidant effect and restored the activity of Na+K+ATPase and AChE [ [85](#B85-brainsci-10-00964)]. The neuronal dendritic growth stimulating property of Bacopa has also been reported which may be responsible for its memory enhancing property [ [86](#B86-brainsci-10-00964)]. [87](#B87-brainsci-10-00964)]. However, six week Bacopa administration (300 mg for subjects under 90 kg, and 450 mg for subjects over 90 kg, equivalent to 6 g and 9 g dried rhizome, respectively) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled fashion was associated with significant improvement in retention of new information in 40-65 year old healthy adults. Though there was no difference in the rate of acquisition of information [ [88](#B88-brainsci-10-00964)]. [89](#B89-brainsci-10-00964)] reported significant improvement in verbal learning, memory consolidation and speed of early information processing following Bacopa administration (containing 55% combined bacosides) for 12 weeks at a dose of 300 mg daily in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers (age 18-60 years, n = 46). Since the effects were not observed until five weeks of treatment, the slow onset of action may be attributed to Bacopa's antioxidant properties and/or its effect on the cholinergic system. In another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 54 elderly participants without clinical signs of dementia (mean age 73.5 years), similar Bacopa treatment enhanced an auditory verbal learning test, delayed word recall memory scores and a stroop test relative to the placebo [ [14](#B14-brainsci-10-00964)]. In subjects above 55 years of age with memory impairment, standardized Bacopa extract 125 mg was given twice daily for 12 weeks in a double blind, placebo-controlled manner. There was a significant improvement in mental control, logical memory and paired associated learning [ [90](#B90-brainsci-10-00964)]. Furthermore, Bacopa extract at the dose of 300 mg/kg, daily for 12 weeks improved memory acquisition and retention in healthy older Australians population [ [91](#B91-brainsci-10-00964)]. [92](#B92-brainsci-10-00964)]. However, this study was not blinded. Negi et al. [ [93](#B93-brainsci-10-00964)] carried out a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 36 children diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (mean age 8.3-9.3 years). Nineteen children received Bacopa extract (standardized to contain 20% bacosides) at a dosage of 50 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. As compared to placebo, a significant improvement in cognitive function was observed in Bacopa-treated children at 12 weeks as evidenced by improvement in sentence repetition, logical memory and paired associate learning tasks, which was maintained at 16 weeks (after four weeks of placebo administration). [77](#B77-brainsci-10-00964)]. The intraperitoneal LD50 was 1000 mg/kg for aqueous extract and 15 g/kg for alcoholic extract [ [94](#B94-brainsci-10-00964)]. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy male volunteers reported safety and tolerability of bacosides in single (20-30 mg) and multiple (100-200 mg) daily doses over a four-week period [ [77](#B77-brainsci-10-00964)]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial reported that Bacopa treatment (300 mg/kg, daily) for 12 weeks caused increased stool frequency, abdominal cramps and nausea, which may be due to either an upregulation of ACh level or saponin-mediated gastrointestinal tract irritation, [95](#B95-brainsci-10-00964)]. [96](#B96-brainsci-10-00964)]. [97](#B97-brainsci-10-00964)]. [98](#B98-brainsci-10-00964)]. It has been reported in various experimental studies to possess wide variety of biological and pharmacological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering properties, all three of which are key processes involved in the pathogenesis of AD. [99](#B99-brainsci-10-00964), [100](#B100-brainsci-10-00964)]. Nanoliposomes of curcumin have high affinity for A1-42 fibrils and were found to inhibit the formation of and oligomeric enhanced the cellular uptake of curcumin and increased its efficacy against A induced cytotoxicity [ [103](#B103-brainsci-10-00964)]. Curcumin also demonstrated a protective effect against A neurotoxicity by decreasing A production through downregulation of presenilin 1 (PS1) and GSK-3- expression [ [104](#B104-brainsci-10-00964), [105](#B105-brainsci-10-00964)]. [106](#B106-brainsci-10-00964), [107](#B107-brainsci-10-00964)]. Curcumin treatment for six months significantly decreased the elevated levels of oxidized protein and proinflammatory interleukin-1 in the transgenic APPSw mouse brain (Tg2576) [ [106](#B106-brainsci-10-00964)]. Plaque formation and the concentration of insoluble and soluble A were also lowered by curcumin in the same study. Pretreatment with curcumin (10, 20 and 50 mg/kg, p.o for 21 days) ameliorated memory impairment in the sporadic AD model in mice [ [108](#B108-brainsci-10-00964)]. Furthermore, curcumin in diet form improved the spatial memory, oxidative stress and synaptophysin loss via reducing A deposits [ [109](#B109-brainsci-10-00964)]. Significant cognitive improvement was documented at low (160 ppm) and high (1000 ppm) doses of curcumin after administration for the 6-month period in the double transgenic AD model (APP/PS1) [ [110](#B110-brainsci-10-00964)]. In-vivo, curcumin may protect cells from beta amyloid attack and subsequent oxidative stress-induced damage [ [111](#B111-brainsci-10-00964)]. Curcumin can inhibit A aggregation or promote its disaggregation at low concentrations (IC50 = 0.81-1 M). Monomeric A formed fewer aggregates in the presence of curcumin, whereas increasing doses of curcumin promoted disassembly of preformed A aggregates. Structurally, curcumin is similar to Congo red and can prevent oligomer formation after binding to plaques and recognize secondary structure in fibrillar and oligomeric A. Low dose curcumin significantly lowered the soluble A levels, insoluble amyloid and plaque burden by nearly 40% [ [106](#B106-brainsci-10-00964)]. Additionally, curcumin treatment for 7 days caused reduction in plaques burden and reversed structural changes in dystrophic dendrites in APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD [ [112](#B112-brainsci-10-00964)]. [113](#B113-brainsci-10-00964), [114](#B114-brainsci-10-00964), [115](#B115-brainsci-10-00964)]. Curcumin significantly improved cognitive function the IGF-1 level in the intracerebroventricular (ICV)-streptozotocin (STZ) model of sporadic AD [ [116](#B116-brainsci-10-00964)]. It suppressed IL-1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein, reduced oxidative damage and plaque burden and decreased the amount of insoluble amyloid [ [26](#B26-brainsci-10-00964)]. Another experimental study showed that curcumin treatment restored learning and memory functions in the STZ model of AD by reducing the oxidative stress, enhancing ChAT activity and restoring insulin receptor protein [ [117](#B117-brainsci-10-00964), shown to be proamyloidogenic in APP transgenic mice. Curcumin can also reduce two other proamyloidogenic factors, oxidative damage [ [125](#B125-brainsci-10-00964), [126](#B126-brainsci-10-00964)] and raised cholesterol levels [ [127](#B127-brainsci-10-00964)]. The neuroprotective effect of curcuminoid mixture and its individual components on inflammatory and apoptotic gene expression in AD using an A plus ibotenic acid-infused rat model has also been reported [ [128](#B128-brainsci-10-00964)]. Additionally, Ahmed and colleagues also reported that a curcuminoids mixture (bisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin and curcumin) treatment improved memory function in amyloid fragment induced AD-like conditions in rats [ [129](#B129-brainsci-10-00964)]. Nonetheless, chronic treatment with curcumin also prevented the colchicine induced cognitive impairment in rats by reducing the oxidative stress [ [130](#B130-brainsci-10-00964)]. [131](#B131-brainsci-10-00964)]. The protective effect of curcumin on a A1-40 AD model was documented by Wang et al. [ [132](#B132-brainsci-10-00964)] and Yin et al. [ [133](#B133-brainsci-10-00964)], where treatment with 300 mg/kg curcumin reversed spatial learning and memory impairment accompanied by hippocampal regeneration. Evidence also suggests that metals are concentrated in the AD brain and curcumin chelates iron and copper (but not zinc) bound to beta amyloid potentially contributing to amyloid reduction [ [134](#B134-brainsci-10-00964)]. A different approach was followed by McClure et al. [ [135](#B135-brainsci-10-00964)], where aerosol-mediated treatment of young 5XFAD mice with curcumin averted A buildup and memory deficits in adulthood as compared to the untreated mice. [136](#B136-brainsci-10-00964)]. In an acute toxicity study, ethanolic extract of rhizome of C. longa at the doses of 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg did not cause any sign of toxicity in mice. Moreover, no toxicity was found at 100 mg/kg/day in the 90-day toxicity study in mice [ [137](#B137-brainsci-10-00964)]. 3.4. Clitoria ternatea [138](#B138-brainsci-10-00964)]. The extracts of C. ternatea have been used in Ayurveda, as an ingredient in \"Medhya rasayana\". [138](#B138-brainsci-10-00964)]. [138](#B138-brainsci-10-00964)]. [139](#B139-brainsci-10-00964)]. Taranalli and Cheeramkuzhy evaluated the extracts of roots and aerial parts of C. ternatea at the dose of 300 and 500 mg/kg, p.o in amnesia induced by submaximal electroshock [ [140](#B140-brainsci-10-00964)]. They also estimated the ACh level in the whole brain and different parts of it. The aerial parts extract resulted in improved memory retention and increased brain ACh content, which was more at 300 mg/kg as compared to the 500 mg/kg dose. The root extract exhibited similar but more marked effects, which were almost equal at both doses. [141](#B141-brainsci-10-00964)] described the learning and memory enhancing effect of the C. ternatea root extract during the growth spurt period in rats. They intubated 7-day old neonatal rats and administered 50 and 100 mg/kg of the aqueous root extract of C. ternatea for 30 days. The extract improved retention in the passive avoidance task and spatial performance in the T-maze test. The behavioral changes were reported to be long lasting as indicated by a 30 days post-treatment evaluation. A previous study also showed that the aqueous root extract (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o for 30 days) enhanced dendritic arborization of amygdala neurons in rats [ [142](#B142-brainsci-10-00964)]. This cognition enhancing effect was hypothesized to be due to the presence of growth factors similar to the brain derived neurotrophic factor or nerve growth factor. Increase in hippocampus acetylcholine content [ [139](#B139-brainsci-10-00964)] may be one of the reasons for nootropic activity of C. ternatea root. In addition, Rai [ [143](#B143-brainsci-10-00964)] reported that the C. ternatea root extract exhibited the neurogenesis-promoting sequel on the anterior subventricular zone of neural stem cells. More recently, Damodaran et al. [ [144](#B144-brainsci-10-00964)] documented the neuroprotective effect of the C. ternatea root extract in reversing chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced neural damage and memory impairment at doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg. In another study, Mehla and colleagues showed anti-AD effects of C. ternatea in ICV-STZ induced AD-like conditions in rats [ [145](#B145-brainsci-10-00964)]. These observations suggest that C. ternatea extract exerts its beneficial effect by preventing the progression of cognitive deterioration in AD. However, the potential of C. ternatea extract still needs to be systematically evaluated for human use. [140](#B140-brainsci-10-00964)]. Taur and Patil [ [146](#B146-brainsci-10-00964)] reported LD50 of ethanolic C. [148](#B148-brainsci-10-00964)]. Ashwagandha is Sanskrit writings from India as a \"Medhya rasayan\". It is also known as Indian ginseng and is widely used in Ayurveda. It is an ingredient in many formulations prescribed as a general tonic to increase energy, improve overall health and longevity [ STZ through the antioxidant mechanism [ [154](#B154-brainsci-10-00964)]. The root preparation has been shown to have protective effects in neurodegenerative disorders by reducing stress induced degeneration in the brain hippocampus of rats [ [155](#B155-brainsci-10-00964)]. The extract containing sitoindosides VII-X and withaferin A (50 mg/kg, p.o for two weeks) reversed ibotenic acid-induced cognitive deficit and reduction in cholinergic markers (e.g., ACh and ChAT) in rats [ [156](#B156-brainsci-10-00964)]. Sitoindosides VII-X and withaferin differentially (40 mg/kg for 7 days) but favorably altered the AChE activity and enhanced M1- and M2-muscarinic receptor-binding in various brain regions [ [157](#B157-brainsci-10-00964)]. Withaferin A and Withanolide A suggested to have a potent immunomodulatory effect in BV-2 microglial cells by triggering the Nrf2 pathway, leading to production of the neuroprotective protein, such as heme oxygenase-1 and dendritic regeneration and synaptic reconstruction in cultures of rat cortical neurons damaged by the amyloid peptide, A(25-35) [ [44](#B44-brainsci-10-00964)]. Therefore, withanoside IV may act as a prodrug, with sominone as the active component. The enhancement of spatial memory by sominone may be attributed to neuritic outgrowth, which is mediated by the neurotrophic factor receptor, RET [ [159](#B159-brainsci-10-00964)]. Methanolic root extract dose dependently enhanced in-vitro dendrite formation in human neuroblastoma cells [ [159](#B159-brainsci-10-00964)]. A study carried out by Jayaprakasam et al. [ [160](#B160-brainsci-10-00964)] stated that withanamides (A/C) present in W. somnifera fruits protect pheochromocytoma-(PC-12) from -amyloid induced toxicity. In the same study, -amyloid fibril formation was prevented, possibly due to the presence of a serotonin moiety in both withanamide compounds. [161](#B161-brainsci-10-00964)]. Alcoholic extract of the Withania leaf and its component withanone was neuroprotective against scopalmine induced changes in the brain [ [162](#B162-brainsci-10-00964)]. An in-vitro, inhibitory effect on the fibril formation by A peptide has also been reported [ [163](#B163-brainsci-10-00964)]. The increase in cortical muscarinic ACh receptor capacity might partly explain the cognition-enhancing and memory-improving effects of Withania. The root extract and their chemical constituents such as glycowithanolides also possess anxiolytic, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, which may be relevant in AD treatment [ [164](#B164-brainsci-10-00964), [165](#B165-brainsci-10-00964)]. Furthermore, withanone, a chemical constituent from root extract of W. somnifera showed improvement in cognitive functions by inhibiting amyloid processing and reducing the elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [ [166](#B166-brainsci-10-00964)]. W. somnifera (20 mg/mL) treatment mitigated the A toxicity and mediated longevity in the AD model of Drosophila melanogaster [ [167](#B167-brainsci-10-00964)]. [168](#B168-brainsci-10-00964)]. In a systematic review, Ng and colleagues mentioned that W. somnifera extract ameliorated cognitive impairment and improved executive functions in adults with mild cognitive impairment [ [169](#B169-brainsci-10-00964)]. There is limited data available on the clinical use of Withania for cognitive impairment. [170](#B170-brainsci-10-00964)]. Ashwagandholine 2% suspension in propylene glycol had a LD50 of 465 mg/kg in rats and 432 mg/kg in mice [ [171](#B171-brainsci-10-00964)]. Whereas intraperitoneal administration of aqueous-methanol root extract caused 50% lethality in mice at a dose of 1076 \u00b1 78 mg/kg [ [172](#B172-brainsci-10-00964)]. [173](#B173-brainsci-10-00964)]. In Ayurveda, C. paniculatus has been used to treat many diseases like depression, leprosy, paralysis, fever and arthritis. The seed oil and fruit are commonly used for their tranquilizer, sedative and wound healing properties [ [174](#B174-brainsci-10-00964)]. [175](#B175-brainsci-10-00964)]. [176](#B176-brainsci-10-00964)]. [177](#B177-brainsci-10-00964)]. The antioxidant activity of C. paniculatus may be involved in improving the cognitive function [ [45](#B45-brainsci-10-00964)]. The oil of C. paniculatus seeds when given for 14 days to Wistar rats at a dose of 400 mg/kg resulted in enhanced learning and memory in radial arm maze and decreased the AChE enzyme activity in hypothalamus, frontal cortex and hippocampus [ [178](#B178-brainsci-10-00964)]. Karanth et al. [ [179](#B179-brainsci-10-00964)] also demonstrated a similar effect of C. paniculatus at the dose of 400 mg/kg for 3 days. In another study, rats treated with 850 mg/kg of C. paniculatus oil for 15 days had significantly improved retention in two passive avoidance tasks [ [56](#B56-brainsci-10-00964)]. The seed oil treatment for 14 days at the doses of 50, 200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o reversed scopolamine induced spatial memory impairment in the Morris water maze and increased locomotor activity without affecting AChE activity in rats [ [180](#B180-brainsci-10-00964)]. The aqueous seed extract improved memory performance in elevated plus maze and in sodium nitrite induced amnesia by reducing the AChE activity [ [181](#B181-brainsci-10-00964)]. Furthermore, C. paniculatus seed oil treatment showed memory improvement in scopolamine induced amnesia in mice [ [182](#B182-brainsci-10-00964)]. C. paniculatus has not undergone clinical trials for safety and efficacy. Animal toxicology data is also lacking to date. 3.7. Evolvulus alsinoides [183](#B183-brainsci-10-00964)]. It is locally known as Shankhpushpi and is very commonly used in Ayurveda. It is a key ingredient in majority of Medhya Rasayana formulations available in the Indian market. It is traditionally used as a memory enhancer in children and elderly and for neurological disorders like epilepsy [ [184](#B184-brainsci-10-00964)]. [185](#B185-brainsci-10-00964)]. [189](#B189-brainsci-10-00964)] activities. [190](#B190-brainsci-10-00964)] reported learning and memory enhancing property of its ethanolic extract and ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions in rats. The ethanolic extract (100 mg/kg, p.o) also protected against scopolamine induced dementia in rats [ [188](#B188-brainsci-10-00964)]. Three days oral treatment with E. alsionoides (100 mg/kg) was effective in decreasing scopolamine induced deficit in adult male Swiss mice [ [188](#B188-brainsci-10-00964)]. Pretreatment with hydro-alcoholic extract at the doses of 100, 300 and 500 mg/kg, p.o ameliorated the ICV-STZ induced cognitive impairment by decreasing the oxidative stress and rho kinase (ROCK II) expression in the rat brain [ [15](#B15-brainsci-10-00964), [145](#B145-brainsci-10-00964)]. In-vitro, aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of all of which are involved in the pathophysiology of AD [ [15](#B15-brainsci-10-00964)]. Previous studies also indicated the memory enhancing effect of E. alsionoides in the experimental model of amnesia [ [191](#B191-brainsci-10-00964), [192](#B192-brainsci-10-00964)]. The methanol and water extract of E. alsinoides documented to exhibit acetylcholinesterase activity, supporting its potential in reverting neuronal dysfunctions and thus in management of AD [ [193](#B193-brainsci-10-00964)]. E. alsionoides has not been studied systematically for clinical efficacy and toxicological effects. 3.8. Desmodium gangeticum [194](#B194-brainsci-10-00964)]. It has been used in the traditional system of medicine as a bitter tonic, febrifuge, antiemetic, digestive and in various inflammatory conditions due to vata disorder [ [195](#B195-brainsci-10-00964)]. In Satpuda hills of India, powdered root of D. gangeticum is applied along with honey to treat a mouth ulcer. In Uttat Pradesh state of India, the leaf paste of D. gangeticum and aloe vera are applied to prevent hair [198](#B198-brainsci-10-00964), [199](#B199-brainsci-10-00964)]. Scopolamine and prevented in rats by pretreatment with the aqueous extract of D. gangeticum [ [198](#B198-brainsci-10-00964)]. Moreover, treatment of mice with the chloroform extract (400 mg/kg) and alkaloidal fraction (50 mg/kg) of D. gangeticum for days alleviated the scopolamine-induced amnesia [ [200](#B200-brainsci-10-00964)]. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and AChE inhibitory activity gangeticum also been reported [ [199](#B199-brainsci-10-00964), [201](#B201-brainsci-10-00964), [202](#B202-brainsci-10-00964)]. These pharmacological properties indicate the potential of D. gangeticum in the management of AD related cognitive impairment. Yet, not much clinical evidence is available to this effect. Toxicity studies are also required to establish the safety of this potentially useful herb. 3.9. Eclipta Species [203](#B203-brainsci-10-00964)]. Its stem is reddish-purple in color with up-turned hairs and roots are greyish with cylindrical shape [ [204](#B204-brainsci-10-00964)]. Eclipta alba (E. alba), commonly known as Bringharaj, is well known in the traditional system of medicine for its beneficial effects on learning and memory [ [205](#B205-brainsci-10-00964)]. Another species of Eclipta, commonly known as false daisy, is E. prostrate. It has also been traditionally used for treatment of memory related disorders, hepatic disorders and atherosclerosis [ [206](#B206-brainsci-10-00964)]. [207](#B207-brainsci-10-00964)]. [207](#B207-brainsci-10-00964)]. Saponins, the main chemical constituent of butanol fraction of E. prostrate, prevented ethanol induced memory impairment in rats [ [208](#B208-brainsci-10-00964)]. Kim et al. [ [209](#B209-brainsci-10-00964)] also reported that butanol fraction increased ACh content, decreased MAO-B activity and reduced oxidative stress in the rat brain. Lipid lowering and antioxidant activities of Eclipta plants have also been reported [ [210](#B210-brainsci-10-00964)]. E. alba also possesses antiviral, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, [211](#B211-brainsci-10-00964), [212](#B212-brainsci-10-00964)]. Previous study also reported the improvement in learning and memory functions of rats [ [213](#B213-brainsci-10-00964)]. Based on the animal data available, the herb needs to be evaluated clinically. [137](#B137-brainsci-10-00964)]. The alcoholic extract did not show any toxicity in rats and mice and the minimum lethal dose was found to be greater than 2.0 g/kg when given orally and intraperitonially in mice [ [214](#B214-brainsci-10-00964)]. 3.10. Moringa oleifera [215](#B215-brainsci-10-00964)]. It is commonly known as a drumstick. M. oleifera has shown antimicrobial activity and traditionally been used to clarify water due to its coagulant property. Oil of M. oleifera has high stability and contains a large amount oleic acid, hence used as an edible oil, biodiesel and immunomodulatory and anticancer effects. M. oleifera is a good source of vitamin, hence prevents night-blindness and delays cataract development [ [217](#B217-brainsci-10-00964)]. [223](#B223-brainsci-10-00964)]. The ethanolic leaf extract at a dose of 250 mg/kg, p.o for 14 days provided protection against cognitive impairment induced by ICV-colchicine. It restored colchicine induced changes in the brain norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine levels [ [224](#B224-brainsci-10-00964)]. Improvement in learning and memory has been suggested to be due to its antioxidant effect. Other studies also demonstrated the protective effect of M. oleifera against memory impairment in experimental models of dementia [ [225](#B225-brainsci-10-00964), [226](#B226-brainsci-10-00964)]. Intriguingly, M. oleifera was shown to mitigate hyperphosphorylation and A pathology also in hyperhomocysteinemia-induced AD in rats [ [227](#B227-brainsci-10-00964)]. The mechanism of action, composition of the herb and difference between different extracts need to be established before it can be taken to clinical trials. 3.11. Convolvulus pluricaulis [230](#B230-brainsci-10-00964)]. It is commonly known as shankhpushpi and is used as a nervine tonic in the Ayurvedic system of medicine, to improve memory and intellect [ [230](#B230-brainsci-10-00964)]. It is classified as Medhya rasayana (promotes intellectual capacity) and Majjadhatu rasayana (rejuvenates the nervous tissue). The leaves of C. pluricaulis have been used for depression and other mental disturbances [ [231](#B231-brainsci-10-00964)]. [232](#B232-brainsci-10-00964)]. [233](#B233-brainsci-10-00964), cardiovascular activity a chemical constituent of C. pluricaulis potentiated the effect of arecoline (memory enhancer) and improved cognitive dysfunction in AD [ [238](#B238-brainsci-10-00964), [239](#B239-brainsci-10-00964)]. Sharma et al. [ [240](#B240-brainsci-10-00964)] also reported that the ethanolic extract at 100 and 200 mg/kg oral dose significantly improved memory in young and aged mice but the retention was better in young mice. C. pluricaulis also possesses antioxidant and hypolipidemic effects, which may be partially responsible for improvement in cognitive function [ [190](#B190-brainsci-10-00964), [241](#B241-brainsci-10-00964)]. C. pluricaulis administration for 3 months at the dose of 150 mg/kg prevented aluminum chloride induced neurotoxicity by decreasing AChE activity, reducing oxidative stress and preserving the activity of ChAT and Nerve Growth Factor-Tyrosine kinase A receptor (NGF-TrkA) [ [242](#B242-brainsci-10-00964)]. Alcoholic extract of C. pluricaulis Choisy (leaves) showed A production inhibition in-vitro scopolamine induced amnesia in mice [ [244](#B244-brainsci-10-00964)]. Despite detailed experimental studies, the herb has not been evaluated clinically. [245](#B245-brainsci-10-00964)]. 4. Other Plants with Potential Memory Enhancing Activity 5. Methodology 6. Indian Herbal Formulations Studied in Alzheimer's Disease 6.1. Mentat [156](#B156-brainsci-10-00964)]. 20 days at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day significantly prolonged the shortened step-through latency induced by aluminum administration and also significantly improved retention of learning in aged rats [ [248](#B248-brainsci-10-00964)]. Ramteke et al. [ [249](#B249-brainsci-10-00964)] reported that administration of BR-16A facilitated learning and memory in rats on the Hebb Williams complex maze as compared to control. BR-16A also showed dose dependent improvement in learning and memory in scopolamine induced amnesia in rats [ [250](#B250-brainsci-10-00964)]. Mentat when administered for 2 weeks reversed the cognitive deficit and cholinergic dysfunction induced by colchicine and ibotenic acid model of AD [ [251](#B251-brainsci-10-00964)]. [252](#B252-brainsci-10-00964)], increased memory span and attenuated fluctuations of attention in normal adults and improved learning ability in children with behavioral problems or minimal brain damage [ [253](#B253-brainsci-10-00964)]. 6.2. Trasina [255](#B255-brainsci-10-00964)]. 6.3. Memorin attenuate retrograde and anterograde amnesia in rats when tested using passive avoidance learning paradigms in the shuttle box and T-maze test [ [257](#B257-brainsci-10-00964)]. 6.4. Bramhi Ghrita [258](#B258-brainsci-10-00964)]. Achliya et al. [ [259](#B259-brainsci-10-00964)] evaluated the learning and memory enhancing effect of this formulation at 30, 50 and 100 mg/kg oral doses. The results of this study showed that Bramhi Ghrita at the doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o decreased the transfer latency in elevated plus maze and escape latency in Morris water maze test. Additionally, it enhanced the learning and memory of rats indicating the nootropic activity [ [260](#B260-brainsci-10-00964)]. 6.5. Abana [261](#B261-brainsci-10-00964)]. 7. Herbal Drugs: Regulatory Status [262](#B262-brainsci-10-00964)]. In European Union, Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) issues scientific opinions on herbal substances and preparations [ [263](#B263-brainsci-10-00964)]. The regulatory pathways depend on prior human exposure and range from traditional use registration; well established use marketing authorization and to stand alone or mixed application. [264](#B264-brainsci-10-00964)]. Licensing, composition, formulation and manufacturing of products, labeling, packing and quality is done as per Schedule T [ [265](#B265-brainsci-10-00964)]. Safety and efficacy studies are undertaken in accordance with AYUSH GCP guidelines [ [266](#B266-brainsci-10-00964)]. 8. Issues and Challenges with Herbal Drugs [267](#B267-brainsci-10-00964)]. Some reports also showed that adverse events are caused due to the herb-drug interaction [ [267](#B267-brainsci-10-00964), [268](#B268-brainsci-10-00964), [269](#B269-brainsci-10-00964)]. Heterogeneity in doses and frequency of use also obstruct precise assessment of drug interactions. CYP450 is involved in the metabolism of drugs used for management of AD [ [270](#B270-brainsci-10-00964), [271](#B271-brainsci-10-00964)]. Hence CYP450 inhibition by herbal drugs should be assessed for predicting potential herb-drug interactions. Ginkgo biloba when given with donepezil cause an increased effect in AD due to additive cholinergic activity. However, when it was given with phenytoin, it causes breakthrough seizures due to the induction of CYP2C19. Curcumin increase the oral bioavailability of celiprolol due to inhibition of intestinal CYP450 enzymes p-glycoprotein effect [ [273](#B273-brainsci-10-00964)] and good BBB permeability [ [274](#B274-brainsci-10-00964)]. More experimental and clinical studies need to be performed to evaluate the herb-drug interaction. Such interactions may be prevented with disclosure of concomitant use by the patients and awareness of physicians. In the elderly population, the absorption, metabolism and elimination of drugs are already impaired. Concomitantly use of herbal medicines may worsen the impairment. Therefore, herbal drugs should be used cautiously in elderly patients. 9.
