You may have noticed the red and purple circles on Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps' back and biceps as he dipped in and out of the water during the Summer Games in Rio. At least eight rings dotted Phelps' body as if a school of large catfish had latched on to his skin underwater and left him with hickeys. The marks were from an ancient healing practice called cupping that claims to rid the body of toxins, recirculate stagnant blood and ease sore muscles. Fans of cupping say it boosts their energy and some even claim it reduces the appearance of cellulite. Phelps isn't the only celebrity fan of cupping. [Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston](http://www.eonline.com/news/409206/5-celebrity-cupping-fans-jennifer-aniston-gwyneth-paltrow-and-more) have appeared on red carpets in backless dresses with red rings dotting their shoulder blades and spines. [Samuel L. Jackson](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3535967/Samuel-L-Jackson-latest-star-try-celebrity-cupping-craze-shares-snap-alternate-therapy-method.html) said he's a cupping fan, too. Cupping involves lying face down on a massage table while a therapist attaches suction cups to your back, shoulders and limbs. Either heat or a pump is used to suck the air out of the cups so that skin is pulled into them. Anywhere from one to eight cups are typically used and they are left in place for 5-15 minutes. Cups are made of glass, bamboo and clay. Silicone cups can be placed on top of oiled skin and moved around so that a bigger area is sucked into the cup and then released. It's sort of a like a massage in that pressure is applied to the tissue. And like a deep massage, cupping can leave marks on the skin. The purplish circles on Phelps' back are rings of blood vessels that have burst under the pressure of the suction cups. Phelps said he has cupping nearly every time he competes to help ease sore muscles. But there isn't solid scientific proof that cupping works. In a [study published earlier this year,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4814666/) researchers in Taiwan investigated the effects of cupping on chronic neck and shoulder pain. They found it increased skin temperature for about 10 minutes and increased blood flow. The authors said their results show cupping \"provides significant and effective relief of [neck and shoulder pain]\" which is a far-fetched conclusion given only 60 people were included in the study. Bolder claims are made by researchers in the Ukraine who say cupping lowers the amount of a type of cell found in the immune system called natural killer cells. In their [study](http://www.jcimjournal.com/jim/FullText2.aspx?articleID=S2095-4964(16)60250-9) published in the Journal of Integrative Medicine, 23 participants underwent cupping three times in five days. The researchers said cupping reduced the number of those immune system cells and made the cells less active and toxic. Most studies about cupping are small, badly designed and biased. One larger study from 2012 combined 135 reports and found cupping might be useful for treating acne and back pain when combined with medication. Cupping can be dangerous, particularly if combined with bloodletting, a practice where small cuts are made in the skin before suction cups are attached. Usually only small amounts of bleeding occur and practitioners say it helps rid the body of toxins. If blades are reused or not sterilized properly, patients are at risk of blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. In a study published this month, doctors in South Korea described a [patient who suffered a burst artery](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27481914) after cupping. More common side effects include bruising, skin irritation, burns and infections. A lack of evidence about its effectiveness hasn't stopped athletes and celebrities from turning to cupping. And they're hardly the first. Cupping dates back 3,000 years when Chinese practitioners used the therapy to treat patients with blocked or misaligned energy or what's known as Qi in traditional Chinese medicine. Cupping is mentioned in one of the oldest medical books in the world, the Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian manuscript that dates to 1550 B.C. Hippocrates was a fan and the ancient Greeks passed the practice on to the Romans. There's evidence that cupping has been used in the West since at least the 1800s. Now it's experiencing an Olympic moment, but there's no scientific proof that it works. Debunked is your go-to site for demystifying science and medicine.
