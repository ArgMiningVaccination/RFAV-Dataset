J Leukoc Biol ; 2023 Mar 11. Artigo initial [reports]of [patients]hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which revealed prompt [NK cell]activation during the [acute disease] [state]. Another hallmark of COVID-19, early on observed, was a decrease in numbers of [NK cells]in the circulation. Data from [patients]with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as from [in vitro]models demonstrated strong anti- [SARS-CoV-2]activity by [NK cells], likely direct cytotoxicity as well as indirectly by secreting [cytokines]. Additionally, we describe the molecular mechanisms underlying [NK cell]recognition of [SARS-CoV-2]infected [cells], which involve triggering of multiple activating receptors including NKG2D as well as loss-of-inhibition through NKG2A. Discussed is also the [ability]of [NK cells]to respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection via antibody cytotoxicity. With the [respect]to [NK cells]in the could contribute to [disease] [course]. Finally, while [knowledge]is still rather limited, we discuss current insights suggesting a contribution of an early [NK cell]activation-response in "}
