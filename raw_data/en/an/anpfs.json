Most of our events are recorded and posted on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoSmyf0bwbZEx08G1bafnZw). Strength Training for Aging Bodies Held May 25th, 2021 Strength training is an important part of ensuring your quality of life as you age. When you lose muscle mass, you lose the ability to do the things you enjoy in life. Even simple things, like scrubbing the floor! Evan will guide you through the things you can do to increase your strength in a manageable way. It's not all about boot camp and CrossFit. Have you ever heard someone say \"I'm too old to exercise?\" I think we all have at some point in our lives but the ironic thing is, exercising should never stop no matter what age you are. It actually becomes more important to exercise as you get older and statistics to support this. Strength training has been shown to lower mortality rates, lower the risk of cancer-related deaths, lower the risk of falling, and give an overall increase in the quality of life? There are so many more benefits to strength training than I explained but you get the picture. In this webinar, I'll be explaining why strength training is essential as you get older. A strong body is a healthy body!
