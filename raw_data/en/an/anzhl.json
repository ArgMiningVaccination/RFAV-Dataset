Now, a new term has evolved \"integrative\" medicine, and over the past several years, major cancer facilities across the country have begun incorporating this approach into their patient care. Integrative medicine combines the very best of mainstream conventional therapies such as cutting-edge surgery, chemotherapy and radiation with appropriate complementary therapies proven to have sound scientific evidence as to their safety and effectiveness. It is care that extends not only to the patient's body, but to their mind and spirit as well. Complementary medicine may help ease stress and may help patients cope with [side effects such as nausea](side2.htm), pain and fatigue common to many standard treatments. Complementary medicine falls into five general categories as classified by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (a component of the National Institutes of Health): - Alternative Medical Systems are those which have evolved over many years in different cultures and parts of the world. Some examples include homeopathic and naturopathic medicines in Western culture and Ayurveda and Chinese traditional medicine in non-Western cultures. - Biologically Based Therapies focus on things found in nature such as food, herbs and vitamins, as well as dietary supplements, herbal products and \"natural\" but scientifically unproven products. - Energy Therapies subscribe to the belief that the body has energy fields that can be used to attain wellness. Examples are Tai Chi, Reiki and therapeutic touch. - Manipulative and Body-Based Therapies are based on the manipulation and/or movement of one or more parts of the body, such as in chiropractic manipulation or massage therapy. - Mind-Body Therapies use the premise that the mind can affect the body's functions and improve symptoms. Some examples are biofeedback, hypnosis, imagery, meditation and yoga. Also included in this category are expressive therapies such as art, dance and music. While many cancer centers now offer classes in the some of the techniques listed above, not every choice is right for every patient. If you are considering some type of complementary treatment, discuss these options completely and openly with your doctor. While some choices may be beneficial, care needs to be taken that nothing interferes with your standard treatment or is unsafe in your particular case. If your doctor approves, ask for a referral to a qualified practitioner who has the proper credentials and training. Ask what benefits you might expect from the therapy, and what, if any, the potential risks and side effects might be. Following are some common types of complementary treatment.
