Bachelor of Science in Psychology Professional Associations Florida Chiropractic Association As a Chiropractic Physician, I believe that personalized care is of the utmost importance in helping people achieve their health goals. My 9 1/2 years of education and over 10 years experience in the healthcare field has enabled me to incorporate a patient-centered approach to health that is tailored to the unique needs of those who seek my counsel. Because beliefs, attitudes, and motivations can all play a major role in overall wellness, I examine and include the physical, mental, and emotional aspects of all of my clients in order to make a more holistic and accurate diagnosis. My devotion to good health is the basis and primary focus of my practice. I value the trust and confidence of my patients with whom I work in partnership for better health. Let me tell you a bit about myself to help you better understand why I am as passionate as I am about serving others. First and foremost, my personal relationship with God has helped me through many challenges that otherwise would have left me incapacitated or possibly non-existent. I will explain further as you read. As a result of this relationship, I believe my calling is to serve others through the extensive knowledge I have been blessed with. Prior to my birth, my mother was given medications to help her while she was pregnant, unfortunately as with all medications, they were toxic to her and I. Right away after birth, I started having many health challenges. I don't exactly remember the order, but they included a severely depressed immune system, chronic lung problems that kept me in the hospital often, heart issues that gave rise to the recommendation of a heart transplant, severe allergies, sinusitis, intestinal malfunctions and more. As I grew older, many of my ailments increased in severity. Along the way, I suffered from a great deal of doctor visits, what seemed to be truck loads of medications, frequent hospital stays, tubes in my ears a couple times, tonsils removed and a partridge in a pear tree. I was reported to have Rheumatic Fever at one point, I had Tetanus (even though I had the vaccination), I even got Salmonella. Throw in a half a dozen significant concussions, likely that I wasn't thinking clearly and did stupid things and surprise, my body eventually revolted at greater levels. Anyway, through all of this, I was able to see I wasn't improving, but worsening. I had a wonderful pediatrician and cardiologist, but all the medications were just making me more toxic. So I decided to make a change. Around the 7th grade or so, I started looking for alternatives to the Western philosophies of medicine. My aunt introduced me to Chiropractic (who knew that I would later be a Doctor of Chiropractic). I started researching, learning and reading everything I could. Looking back, I realize it was a great start, but most of the mainstream media advertisements and 'healthy living' advice were flawed. Either way I started trying to eat smarter and exercise better. As time went on I started improving, the biggest thing was that I got off all my meds. Fast forward several years and what I thought was the right direction of health landed me with 2 bouts of 'Fibromyalgia', chronic fatigue, the mis-diagnosis of brain cancer, throat cancer, and lung cancer, ulcers, severe anxiety, some depression and several other lesser malidies. Luckily, I ended up in Chiropractic school. I went to Life University in Atlanta, Georgia. There I met several doctors who guided me to better health, as well as learning completely different means of caring for the human body. It all made much more sense than drugs and surgery for everything. Today I'm living a healthier, happier, more peaceful life with my incredible wife, 4 wonderful children, 3 great dogs, a thriving wellness practice with the main focus being health from within, and many more things that truly bless me daily. There is definitely a time and a place for medication and surgery, however I believe this should only be in times of crisis. I believe we should first approach our inner God given potential to heal as our body was designed. Our bodies don't need help from man to heal, they simply don't need interference. Interference comes in all shapes and sizes. Chemicals like medications and processed foods, environmental toxins, stress, lack of sleep, poor nutrition or poor assimilation and absorption, lack of sunlight, lack of proper exercise and most important of all, improperly functioning nervous system. My job is to remove the interferences that create a loss of homeostasis in your body. I do this through Chiropractic, Nutritional Counseling, Supplementation, Decompression Therapy, Massage Therapy, Physical Therapeutics, Exercise Training and Lifestyle Coaching. In addition to all my health ailments similar to what I treat in our office, that allowed me to live what many doctors/physicians never experience, I have an Associates of Science Degree, a Bachelor of Science Degree (from UCF) in Psychology and a Doctorate of Chiropractic. I have hundreds and probably thousands of hours in additional studies from nutrition, stress management, time management, exercise, rehab, myofascial release, decompression, and so much more than I can remember. I interned at the second largest chiropractic clinic in the world and have been mentored by several of the top doctors in the world. I have been putting all this to work for over 9 years in private practice and a few more otherwise. This I believe is what qualifies me to serve our community, our country and our planet.
