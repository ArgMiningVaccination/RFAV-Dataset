Naturopathic Medicine, which combines modern scientific knowledge with traditional and natural therapies, is performed by Naturopathic doctors (NDs) who are trained in and use a wide variety of different therapies. Naturopathic Medicine Treatments may include special diets and nutritional counselling, fasting, enemas and herbal, vitamin or mineral remedies. Naturopathic Medicine uses natural, non-toxic therapies to treat the whole person and encourage the self-healing process. Naturopathic clinicians treat a variety of conditions, including digestive issues, respiratory conditions, chronic fatigue syndrome and cancer. Various organisations with Integrative Oncology Services offer Naturopathic Medicine where the focus is on reducing the risk of harmful effects from cancer treatments; to support normal metabolism and digestion during cancer treatment; to manage any side effects, such as nausea or fatigue; and to boost immune function. Naturopathic Medicine as a Complementary Therapy Naturopathic medicine is by definition holistic. This means that Naturopathic Practitioners evaluate all aspects of your well-being, including your physical, emotional, and spiritual health. At the core of the naturopathic tradition is the belief that a healthy lifestyle is the cornerstone of physical well-being. While naturopathic medicine is a distinct system of healthcare, that doesn't mean it's opposed to conventional medicine. Cooperation between disciplines is at the heart of the naturopathic philosophy. Naturopaths often collaborate with and refer people to conventional medical doctors for diagnosis or treatment. Naturopathic doctors (NDs) believe that cancer arises from an imbalance that causes a systemic breakdown within the body. They help people with cancer restore internal balance and build their resistance to disease by empowering them to make lifestyle and dietary changes. Although naturopathic medicine draws from diverse and seemingly quite different healing traditions, they all share certain principles: - First do no harm: Naturopathic medicine emphasizes healing therapies that are natural and non-invasive. - The healing power of nature: Naturopathic therapies support and restore the body's inherent ability to heal itself. - Treat the cause: In addition to treating the symptoms of disease, naturopathic medicine seeks to identify and treat the underlying causes of illness. - Heal the whole person: Naturopathic therapies address all aspects of your health, including physical, emotional, spiritual, genetic, and environmental factors. - The naturopath as teacher: Naturopathic practitioners work with the people in their care to educate and empower them to take control of their health. - Preventive medicine: Naturopathic Medicine promotes lifestyle habits that strengthen the immune system and prevent illness. Reputable Naturopathic Practitioners receive rigorous training in conventional medical disciplines, such as anatomy, biochemistry, pathology, and clinical medicine, as well as natural medicine.
