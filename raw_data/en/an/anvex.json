Each patient record has a unique identification number internally generated by the computer which links all information stored about that patient. Patient identification information occurs only once in the patient record. Attached to the patient record is a file containing ten optional, user-defined fields for patient level data. Each patient may have more than one primary malignancy, or case. These are identified by the primary sequence number and site group code. Those cases which are reportable by your hospital will also have segments of the record containing diagnosis and staging information, as well as follow up data. These data items will occur only once in a case record. Attached to the case record are segments containing therapy and open text data. The therapy segments may be repeated as often as necessaryto record all the appropriate information about a case. Additionally, there are record segments which contain hospital-specific identifiers for each case. Twenty optional, user-defined fields are available for each case record. For further information regarding CPDMS.net, please refer to the Operator's Manual. Case Reporting Requirements CASES TO BE REPORTED: All cases of primary malignant disease diagnosed or treated at a Kentucky health care facility on or after January 1, 1991, should be reported to the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR). These are usually described by the terms: carcinoma, sarcoma, melanoma, leukemia, or lymphoma. Reportable cases may be identified by specified ICD-9-CM codes. Refer to for a list of these codes. They may also be classified by Casefinding ICD-O topography, morphology, and behavior codes. Effective with diagnoses in 2010, all hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms classified with a behavior code 3 in the \"WHO Classification of Tumors of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues\" are reportable. These fall into the histology code range of 9590/3 - 9992/3. Only in-situ and malignant neoplasms are reportable (behavior codes 2 and 3); benign, borderline, and metastatic tumors are not reportable to the KCR, except as noted below. However, if a term is used which usually has a behavior code of '0' or '1', but is verified by a pathologist as in-situ or malignant (behavior code 2 or 3), these cases are reportable. THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS to this are: Neoplasms of the skin (ICD-O Topography codes C44.0 to with the are reportable: Epithelial neoplasms of the M Basal neoplasms of the skin NOTE: Localized basal and squamous cell skin cancers greater than 5 cm at diagnosis, as well as those diagnosed at a regional or distant stage, were previously required by ACoS for approved hospitals prior to 2003. They are not required to be reported to KCR or to ACoS after January 1, 2003. Cases of intraepithelial neoplasia, Grade III, of the cervix or prostate (M-8077/2). These are often designated by terms such as CIN III or PIN III. These cases are not required to be abstracted or reported. However, the following cases of Laryngeal intraepithelial neoplasia III (SIN III (VAIN III) of the anal canal (C210-C211) are reportable. Any carcinoma in-situ of the cervix is not to be reported to KCR, as of January 1, 1998. This includes any type of malignancy with a topography code of C53 and a behavior code of 2. Pilocytic astrocytoma (C71.__, M-9421/1) is required to be reported as a malignant brain tumor with 9421/3. As of January 1, 2004, the following non-malignant primary intracranial and central nervous system tumors with a behavior code of /0 or /1 (benign and borderline, or \"non-malignant\") are required to be reported, regardless of histologic type, for these ICD-O-3 topography codes. Table 1. Topography Codes for Benign Brain Tumors Code Description Meninges C70.0 of brain C71.9 Brain, NOS Spinal Cord, Cranial Nerves, and Other Parts of the Central Nervous System C72.0 Spinal cord C72.1 Cauda equina C72.2 Cranial nerve, NOS C72.8 Overlapping lesion of brain and central nervous system C72.9 Nervous system, NOS Other endocrine glands are not reportable. NOTE: For non-malignant primary and nervous system (C70.0 - C72.9, C75.1 - C75.3), the terms \"tumor\" and \"neoplasm\" are considered diagnostic for the purpose of case reporting, in addition to the terms generally applicable to malignant tumors. PATIENTS TO BE REPORTED: All patients first seen and/or treated at each Kentucky hospital after January 1, 1991 for a diagnosis of cancer should be reported to the Kentucky Cancer Registry. This includes inpatient admissions and patients seen in ambulatory care settings that are hospital affiliated. It includes all clinical diagnoses of cancer, whether histologically confirmed or not. It also includes patients diagnosed as autopsy. As of January 1, 1995, all patients seen or treated in any licensed health facility in the state, which provides diagnostic or treatment services to cancer patients, shall report cases to the Kentucky Cancer Registry. Physicians in private practice should report any cases of cancer diagnosed or treated in their offices which are not otherwise reported to KCR by another health care facility. PATIENTS NOT REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED BY HOSPITALS: 1. Patients who are seen only in consultation to confirm a cancer diagnosis or treatment plan, and no treatment was provided by your facility. EXAMPLE: Patient comes to your institution for a second opinion. Staff physicians order diagnostic tests. The physicians support the original treatment plan. Patient returns to the other institution for treatment. 2. Patients who receive transient care to avoid interrupting a course of therapy initiated elsewhere, for example, while vacationing, or because of equipment failure at the original hospital. 3. Patients whose medical chart indicates a history of cancer only, and who were diagnosed prior to 1991. 4. Patients with in-situ or localized neoplasms of the skin (as listed above). 5. Patients with preinvasive neoplasia of the cervix (as listed above). TIME FRAME FOR REPORTING: Cases must be reported to the KCR within 6 months from the date of initial diagnosis or date first seen at the reporting facility if not diagnosed there. For those patients seen on an outpatient basis only, the outpatient visit date is considered the date of discharge. CLASSES OF CASE: The class of case codes as defined by the American College of Surgeons in their Facility Oncology Registry Data Standards (FORDS)manual, describe categories (or classes) of cases based on the facility's role in managing the cancer, whether the cancer is required to be reported, and whether the case was diagnosed after the program's reference date. The reporting requirements of the Kentucky Cancer Registry may differ from those of the American College of Surgeons. For a discussion of ACoS requirements, refer to the FORDS manual. Class of Case divides cases into two groups. Analytic cases (codes 00-22) are those that are required by CoC to be abstracted because of the program's primary responsibility in managing the cancer. Nonanalytic cases (codes 30-49 and 99) may be abstracted by the facility to meet central registry requirements or in response to a request by the facility's cancer program. KCR requires all analytic cases (class 00-22) as well as autopsy only cases (class 38) to be fully abstracted and reported to KCR. In addition, cases of VIN III, VAIN III, AIN III (8077/2), PeIN III, LIN III, LN III, and SIN III, though not required by COC, are required to be reported to SEER and KCR. Therefore, these cases should be coded in the analytic classes (00-22) rather than 34 or 36. They will automatically be excluded from transmission to NCDB by . KCR also requires information about non-analytic cases (class 32 CPDMS.net and 40-43) to be reported to KCR. See Section below: INFORMATION TO BE REPORTED TO KCR. In the 2010 class of case conversion, skin cancers which were reportable prior to 2003 and CIN/CIS of the cervix diagnosed prior to 1998 are converted to class 34 or 36, as applicable. See for a comprehensive list of all classes of cases. Class of Case INFORMATION TO BE REPORTED TO KCR: Cases in classes 00-22 and 38 must be fully abstracted in . All mandatory data elements must be filled in. Detailed CPDMS.net instructions for completing the Abstract Form can be found in this manual. These cases must also be followed annually throughout the life of the patient. A comprehensive method to identify and track patients must be implemented by the reporting hospital. The follow up information that is required to be reported is detailed in items . Follow Up The only exceptions to the follow up requirements are patients residing in foreign countries and patients with carcinoma in situ of the cervix. These two categories of patients are not required to be followed, regardless of class of case. The ACoS does not require CoC approved hospitals to follow patients over 100 years of age. However, KCR requires Kentucky hospitals to follow patients in classesall 00-22, regardless of age. Cases diagnosed prior to January 1, 2000, which are class 32 (formerly class 3 before 2010) must be reported to KCR. Effective with year 2000 diagnoses, registries have a choice in reporting class 32 cases to KCR. Facilities may choose to continue abstracting these cases, or instead they may send the case information to KCR to be abstracted. If your registry chooses to forward the case to KCR, you are still required to send all applicable case information to KCR in a timely manner! Cases in class 37 (formerly class 4 prior to 2010) are not required to be reported to the Kentucky Cancer Registry. Abstracting the case and lifetime follow up are entirely optional. Cases in class 49 (formerly class 8 prior to 2010) are those discovered through death certificate files only. KCR staff will abstract these cases. Class 49 is only for use by the central registry. Cases in class 99 (formerly class 9 prior to 2010) are nonhospital facility cases. Class 99 is only for use by the central registry. NOTE: If your hospital has read an outside pathology report diagnosing cancer, this is not reportable by your facility. However, information regarding the diagnosis MUST be sent to KCR so that the case may be abstracted by nonhospital facility staff. THERAPY - FIRST AND SUBSEQUENT COURSE First course of therapy includes any and all procedures or treatments planned by the managing physician(s), and administered during or after the first clinical diagnosis of cancer. Treatment usually modifies, controls, removes, or destroys proliferating cancer tissue, whether primary or metastatic, regardless of the patient's response. First course may include multiple modes of therapy, and may encompass intervals of a year or more. No therapy is a treatment option that occurs if the patient or family refuses treatment, or the patient dies before treatment starts, or the physician recommends \"watchful waiting\" or no treatment be given. When a treatment plan is not available, evaluate the therapy and the time it started. If the therapy is a part of an established protocol or within accepted management guidelines for the disease, it is first course of therapy. Consult the attending physician or registry's physician advisor if protocols or management guidelines are not available. If there is no treatment plan, established protocol, or management guidelines, and you cannot consult with a physician, use the principle: \"initial treatment must begin within four months of the date of initial diagnosis.\" All other cancer-directed therapy that within fourbegins months of the would be first course of therapy. date of the initial treatment TIME FRAME FOR REPORTING FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION: Current follow-up information must be reported to KCR for every case diagnosed since 1995 that is class 00-22. Follow-up information is considered current if the date of last contact with the patient is within 15 months of the current date. can generate reports CPDMS.net which identify patients who require updated follow-up information. Ambiguous Terminology at Diagnosis According to the Reporting Requirements, all cases of primary malignant disease diagnosed or treated at a Kentucky hospital on or after January1. 1, 1991 are required to be included. These are usually described by the terms: carcinomas, sarcomas, melanomas, leukemias, and lymphomas. The primary reference book which lists all malignant diseases is the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O), third edition. In addition to providing a list of all morphologies considered to be malignant (or cancerous), the ICD-O book also contains cell behavior codes: 3=malignant if primary or metastatic. All malignancies with a behavior code of 2 or 3 in ICD-O, 3rd edition, should be included in the registry, except specified neoplasms of the skin and preinvasive cervical neoplasia, as described in . Benign and borderline CNS tumors diagnosed on or after Case Reporting Requirements January 1, 2004 are required to be reported. Other benign tumors and borderline malignancies (behavior codes 0 and 1) may be listed in the registry in a separate accession register. They should not be entered into CPDMS.net. These diagnoses are referred to as \"reportable-by-agreement\" cases. Metastatic tumors and tumors that are unknown if primary or metastatic (behavior codes 6 and 9) are indicative of a primary malignancy of an unknown site. These cases should be reported with the primary site coded as \"unknown primary\" (topography code of C80.9) and the appropriate morphology code with a behavior code of /3. Inconclusive diagnostic terms Occasionally the diagnosis contains vague or inconclusive terms, such as probable carcinoma of the lung. The following terms are considered to be diagnostic of cancer if they modify a term such as malignancy or carcinoma: apparent(ly) appears compatible with comparable with consistent with favor(s) most likely malignant appearing most likely presumed probable suspect(ed) suspicious (for) typical of EXCEPTION: If a cytology report says \"suspicious,\" do not interpret it as a diagnosis of cancer. Abstract the case only if a positive biopsy or a physician's clinical impression of cancer supports the cytology. The diagnosis date is date of supporting documentation - either physician statement or positive biopsy. If a term does not appear on the above list, or is not a form of a word on this list, the term is not diagnostic of cancer. Do not accession the case. Examples of forms of a word are \"favored\" rather than \"favor(s)\" and \"appeared to be\" rather \"appears.\" substitute as \"supposed\" for \"presumed\" or \"equal\" for \"comparable.\" Any other ambiguous terminology regarding the diagnosis of a malignancy is not to be interpreted as diagnostic of cancer. Some examples are: cannot be ruled out equivocal likely lump lytic lesion (on x-ray) mass neoplasm* nodule possiblepotentially malignant questionable rule out suggests tumor* worrisome For example, a diagnosis of carcinoma of the left lung would be abstracted as a lung primary. A carcinoma is not probable possible reportable. *EXCEPTION: For benign and borderline brain and CNS tumors, the terms \"tumor\" and \"neoplasm\" will be considered diagnostic of a reportable disease. 2.Changing the diagnosis Over time, information may be added to the patient's medical chart that was missing or ambiguous in the original record. It is the practice to accept the thinking and information about the case based on the latest or most complete information. Thus, it is acceptable to change the primary site and histology as information becomes more complete. However, information about the Collaborative Stage and extent of disease at diagnosis may only be changed as long as the new information reflects the time period within four months of the date of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression or through first course surgeries, whichever is longer. There may be cases reported originally as cancer with the ambiguous terms listed previously, which later information indicates never were malignancies. These cases must be deleted from the file, and the sequence number of any remaining cases for the same person adjusted accordingly. Casefinding All participating institutions should establish procedures for complete casefinding within their institution. In many hospitals, records are housed in one location (i.e., the medical records department). In others, procedures for identifying patients from multiple independent ancillary service areas may be necessary (i.e., outpatient clinics, radiation therapy, etc). It is important that the following multiple sources in the hospital be searched to keep missed reportable cases to a minimum. The procedures outlined below should be adapted to each individual hospital. 1. Medical record disease discharge diagnostic index: Any patient record coded with the diagnoses listed below should be reviewed to determine if the case is one which meets KCR reportability criteria. Note that a diagnosis is not necessarily reportable simply because it falls within the codes below; refer to the Case Reportability to make sure the case is truly reportable to KCR. Requirements ICD-10-CM Codes (Effective 10-01-2016 through or (of (excluding category C44), stated presumed to be primary specified site) and certain specified histologies. NEW for canal C44.30-, C44.39- Unspecified/other malignant neoplasm face C44.40, C44.49 C44.99 Unspecified/other malignant neoplasm meninges, brain,CNS D44.3 - D44.5Neoplasm of unspecified (9960/3, anus evidence of on of malignancy smear spid mlit history of benign neoplasm of the brain This procedure is imperative to assure that no cases have been missed, including those originally diagnosed by clinical methods only. A list of detailed and supplemental ICD-10-CM codes effective 10/01/2016 thru 09/30/2017 which may also be used for casefinding is available in APPEN .DIX M Follow this link for a casefinding list of reportable ICD-10 codes effective 10/01/2015, which includes a comprehensive list plus a supplemental list. http://seer.cancer.gov/tools/casefinding/case2016-icd10cm.html 2. Pathology reports: All pathology reports on both inpatients and outpatients should be reviewed for case reportability. Since most cancer patients have a biopsy or operative resection performed, nearly all of the reportable cases can be identified through pathology reports alone. Histologic diagnoses are based upon microscopic examination of tissue taken from such procedures as biopsy, frozen section, surgery, or D & C. Expand path report screening to include benign CNS tumors, beginning with 1-1-04 diagnoses. Check for cases of anal intraepithelial neoplasia, grade III (AIN III), ductal intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (DIN 3), vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, grade III (VAIN III), vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, grade III (VIN III), La ryngeal (PeIN III), neoplasia III (SIN III) excluding cervix NOTE: Path reports may be the best source for finding cases of VIN, VAIN, and AIN (8077/2) and DIN (8500/2). 3. Cytology reports: All cytology reports for both inpatients and outpatients should be reviewed for case reportability. Cytologic diagnoses are based upon microscopic examination of cells as contrasted with tissues. Included are fluid, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, and urinary sediment. Cervical and vaginal smears are common examples. 4. Autopsy reports. 5. Radiation Therapy Department logs. 6. Medical Oncology Department logs. 7. Outpatient Department: New patient registration rosters, clinic appointment books, surgery schedules, diagnostic imaging, and billing departments are additional casefinding sources.8. Alpha listing of previously included cases: Casefinding cannot be considered complete until the CPDMS.net accession list and any previous registry accession lists have been checked to be sure that this is a new patient or a new primary. Creating and Maintaining a Nonreportable List In the course of routine casefinding activities, cases which are found to be nonreportable by your hospital should be added to a nonreportable list. The list should consist of each patient's name, DOB, SSN, medical record number, the type/site of cancer, and a brief explanation of why the case is not reportable to the hospital registry (i.e., \"patient was seen for consult only, no dx or tx,\" or \"patient originally diagnosed prior to reference date\"). A well-maintained nonreportable list will save registrars time by preventing them from reviewing a chart multiple times to check on a particular primary that does not need to be abstracted. The list can be invaluable during casefinding audits by allowing quick resolution of possible missed cases. It is also helpful during the death clearance process. Bear in mind that cases which are not reportable by your hospital, but which reportable to KCR (see ) should ARE Case Reporting Requirements be sent to the central registry to be abstracted there. These may include: A specimen from an outside doctor's office which was sent to your hospital's path lab Any case that was diagnosed and/or treated only in a nonhospital facility A Kentucky resident who was initially diagnosed or treated out of state Staging Systems AJCC Staging The American College of Surgeons (ACoS) Commission on Cancer has required that all approved programs must TNM stage all sites contained in the AJCC since January 1, 1991. Effective with 1995 cases, all cancers must be coded for the Manual for Staging of Cancer AJCC staging elements both clinically and pathologically. Clinical extent of disease is based on information and evidence accumulated before cancer-directed treatment. It is based on the physical examination, imaging, endoscopy, biopsy, surgical exploration, and other relevant findings. Clinical classification is appropriate for sites accessible for clinical examination. Use clinical classification when an organ does not have a pathologic evaluation. Pathologic extent of disease is based on information gathered before cancer-directed treatment, as well as evidence gathered from surgery and pathological examination of the resected specimen. Pathologic extent of disease is a combination of all findings through first course of surgery, or 4 months, whichever is longer, in the absence of disease progression. In 2016, other national standard setters began to require AJCC staging as well. These include the CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries and the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. SEER Summary Stage 2000 The Commission on Cancer also requires Summary Staging for any and all sites not included or not appropriate for AJCC TNM staging. The Kentucky Cancer Registry required On January 1, 2001, Summary Staging 1977 on all cases diagnosed prior to January 1, 2001. the SEER Summary Stage 2000 coding scheme was implemented. This field will be calculated from the data values entered in the SEER Extent of Disease and Collaborative Stage fields, so it does not have to be manually coded. Extent of disease is limited to all information available through completion of first course surgery(ies) or within four months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer. Summary Stage for all sites is based on pathological, operative, and clinical assessments. The priority for using these reports is: -Pathologic -Operative (Particularly important when the surgical procedure does not remove all malignant tissue) -Clinical Directly Coded Summary Stage 2000 This field is required in 2015, in addition to the derived Summary Stage 2000 field mentioned above. SEER Extent of Disease (EOD) For cases diagnosed from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2003, the Kentucky Cancer Registry requires SEER Extent of Disease coding. Extent of Disease should include all information available through completion of surgery(ies) in first course treatment or within four months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer.For all sites, extent of disease is based on a combined clinical and operative/pathological assessment. Use the SEER Extent of Disease Coding Manual, Third Edition (1998) to determine the code values for these fields. Collaborative Staging Collaborative Staging (CS) is to be used for cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 2004. It is not to be used for cases diagnosed prior to that date. Its introduction does not affect CoC requirements for physicians to assign AJCC staging or the requirement that the physician-assigned staging values be recorded in the registry. With Collaborative Staging, registrars code discrete pieces of information once and the CS computer algorithm derives the values for AJCC T, N, M and Stage Group, Summary Stage 1977, and Summary Stage 2000. The derived stage codes are ideally suited for data analysis because of the consistency that can be obtained with objectively-recorded, identically-processed data items. The timing rule for CS coding was designed to make use of the most complete information possible to yield the \"best stage\" information for the tumor at the time of diagnosis- \"use all information gathered through completion of surgery(ies) in first course of treatment or all information available within four months of the date of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is .\" Diseaselonger progression is defined as further direct extension or distant metastasis known to have developed after the diagnosis was established. Information about tumor extension, lymph node involvement, or distant metastasis obtained after disease progression is documented, should be excluded from the CS coding. CS data items are coded by the registrar. The CS algorithm produces the output items listed as derived fields. The derived AJCC items are separate from the physician-coded items; and the derived Summary Stage items are separate from the manually-coded items collected by the CoC in the past. The derived items cannot be manually altered. Like the AJCC and Summary Stage codes that are derived from it, CS is a site-specific staging system. The CS algorithm uses tumor site and histology to determine which CS schema to apply. Depending on the schema, the coding instructions and code definitions will vary. Collaborative Staging codes are defined for every site and histology combination. The AJCC does not cover all sites, and Cancer Staging Manual some histologies are excluded from sites with an AJCC coding scheme. When the CS algorithm processes a site-histology combination that does not have an applicable AJCC code, it assigns the display string \"NA\" for \"Not applicable.\" A blank display string for a derived item means the CS algorithm was not run for the case. The complete instructions and site-histology defined codes are available in the Part I Collaborative Staging Manual and Coding Instructions. provides general instructions and the instructions and codes for generic (non site-specific) items. Part II contains the site-specific instructions and codes. The and related information is available electronically on the AJCC Web site at CS Manual https://cancerstaging.or . g/cstage/Pages/default.aspx In 2016, The Commission on Cancer (CoC) and the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) both discontinued the collection of collaborative stage and implemented AJCC staging. However, at the request of The SEER Program, KCR will continue to collect CS data elements as well as AJCC Staging. First Course Therapy Treatment Plan A treatment plan describes the type(s) of treatment(s) intended to modify or control the malignancy. The documentation confirming a treatment plan may be fragmented. It is frequently found in several different sources, i.e., medical record, clinic record, consultation reports, and outpatient records. All cancer-directed treatments specified in the physician(s) treatment plan are a part of the first course of therapy. A treatment plan may specify only one method of treatment (i.e., surgery) or any combination of therapies (i.e., surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, or other therapy). A single regimen includes the combination of concurrent or adjuvant treatments. All treatments specified in the treatment plan and delivered to the patient are first course of therapy. Time Period All Malignancies Except Leukemia First course of therapy includes all cancer-directed treatment planned by the physician(s) during or after the first diagnosis of cancer. Planned treatment may include multiple modes of therapy, and may encompass intervals of a year or more. No treatment may be a planned treatment option; therefore, first course of therapy may be No treatment. When a treatment plan is not available, evaluate the therapy and the time it started. If the therapy is a part of an established protocol or within accepted management guidelines for the disease, it is first course of therapy. Consult the attending physician or registry's physician advisor if protocols or management guidelines are not available. If there is no treatment plan, established protocol, or management guidelines, and you cannot consult with a physician, use the principle: \"first course treatment must begin within four months of the date of initial diagnosis.\" Any treatment given after four months is subsequent treatment. Treatment failure or disease progression may prompt the physician to stop therapy before the full course has been completed. Record any treatments administered after the discontinuation of first course as secondary or subsequent therapy . If there is no documentation of aonly treatment plan, a progression, recurrence, or treatment failure, first course ends four months after diagnosis date. Any treatment given after fourmonths is second course treatment in the absence of a documented treatment plan or therapy standard. Leukemia Treatment for leukemia is divided into three phases: remission induction, consolidation, and maintenance. Remission induction is initial intensive chemotherapy and/or biological response modifiers. Consolidation is repetitive cycles of chemotherapy and/or irradiation to the brain, given immediately after remission. Maintenance is chemotherapy given for a period of months or even years to maintain remission. Code all therapy that is remission induction, consolidation or maintenance as first course. Do not record treatment that is given after a patient relapses. Some patients do not have a remission. If a patient does not have a remission, record the treatment given in the first attempt to induce a remission. Do not record treatment administered as a change in the original treatment plan. Definitive Treatment Definitive treatment usually modifies, controls, removes, or destroys proliferating cancer tissue. Treatment may be directed toward either the primary or metastatic sites. Physicians administer the treatment(s) to minimize the size of tumor, or to delay the spread of disease. NOTE: Only definitive therapy should be included in statistical analyses of treatment. Surgical codes 00-07, and Other treatment code 0 must be excluded. These codes are not considered definitive therapy. Palliative treatment is treatment that improves the patient's quality of life by preventing or relieving suffering. Palliative therapy may include definitive treatment procedures as well as non-definitive patient care procedures. The patient was diagnosed with stage IV cancer For example: of the prostate with painful bony metastases. The patient starts radiation treatment intended to shrink the tumor in the bone and relieve the intense pain. The radiation treatments are palliative because they relieve the bone pain; the radiation is also first course of therapy because it destroys proliferating cancer tissue. Record any palliative treatment that modifies or destroys cancer tissue as first course therapy. Non-Definitive Treatment (Non-treatment patient care procedures) Non-definitive treatments prolong the patient's life, make the patient comfortable, or prepare the patient for definitive therapy. These treatments are tumor directed. They are not meant to reduce the size of the tumor or delay the spread of disease. Non-definitive procedures includenot diagnostic procedures and supportive care (treatments designed to relieve symptoms and minimize the effects of the cancer). Non-definitive therapies are generally not used in statistical analysis of treatment. EXAMPLES: Surgical procedures: Incisional biopsies Exploratory procedures with or without biopsies Supportive care/relieving symptoms: Palliative care, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy for symptom relief only Pain medication Oxygen Antibiotics administered for an associated infection Transfusions* Intravenous therapy to maintain fluid or nutritional balance Laser therapy directed at relieving symptoms *: Coding Treatment for Hematopoietic Diseases: For many of the newly reportable hematopoietic diseases, the principal treatment isNOTE either supportive care, observation, or another type of treatment that does not meet the usual definition that treatment \"modifies, controls, removes or destroys proliferating cancer tissue.\" Such treatments include phlebotomy, transfusions, aspirin, supportive care and observation. In order to document that patients with hematopoietic diseases did have some medical treatment, SEER and the Commission on Cancer have agreed to record these treatments as First Course \"Other Treatment\" (code 1) for the hematopoietic diseases ONLY. A complete description of the treatment plan should be recorded in the text field for \"Other Treatment\" on the abstract. For more details, consult the Hematopoietic Database. Follow Up Policies And Procedures I. Definition A. Follow-up of cancer patients is the systematic process of obtaining accurate information at least annually, on the patient's health, vital status, and progression of disease. Follow-up information is extremely important for the following reasons:1. 2. 3. 4. 1. 2. 1. 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. To assist in the early identification of the recurrence of a cancer. To assist the physician in getting former cancer patients to return for scheduled treatments and/or checkups. To insure periodic examinations of former cancer patients since they are prone to develop other cancers. To gather information so physicians can review various types of treatment in terms of survival. B. Follow-up information must be sought on analytic cases only (classes 0, 1, and 2), with the following exceptions: Patients who are currently residing in foreign countries (New in NAACCR) Patients whose only malignancy is carcinoma in situ of the cervix These are not required to be followed, regardless of the class of the case. C. Follow-up is considered delinquent by the American College of Surgeons (ACoS) if the information is not successfully obtained and documented within 15 months of the patient's previous date of last contact. A successful follow-up rate of 90% of a hospital's analytic cases is considered in compliance with ACoS standards for an approved Cancer Program. It is best to maintain the highest follow-up rate possible; survival rates and other valuable statistical analyses are heavily dependent on accurate and timely follow-up information. II. Follow-up information to be collected includes: A. The date of last contact. This is either the date of death or the most current date the patient was known to be alive. B. Survival status. This indicates whether the patient is alive (with or without disease) or dead (from causes related or unrelated to cancer). C. Present address of patient, if different from that originally recorded. D. Disease Status. This is information about whether the patient was ever disease free, and if so, the start date of the disease free interval. E. Recurrence information. This includes the date of first recurrence, the type of first recurrence, and the site(s) of first recurrence. F. Additional treatment received. This includes the type(s) and date(s) of therapy given after the last date of last contact. G. If dead, cause of death. This includes any autopsy information available on this patient. H. Method of obtaining follow-up information. This includes any change in the name or address of the primary or alternate contact persons or in the method for pursuing follow-up on the next attempt. III. Procedures A. A list of all patients in the tumor registry for whom no contact has been recorded in the last 12 months can be generated using CPDMS.net. B. All cancer registries, even the smallest, need form letters, particularly to make physician contact. All form letters should be printed on hospital letterhead and should have the correct phone number, including extension, for the staff contact person. Be sure there is ample space to insert names, addresses, and any additional information about the patient on the form. The information request form for physicians requires a great deal of care in design. You must provide adequate information: the full name of the patient, the diagnosis clearly stated, and the date of your latest information. The data items you request must be arranged in a logical sequence and must be easily recorded. If you must secure physician permission to contact a patient, include that request on the form. C. It is customary in most registries to obtain physician permission to contact patients directly when contact through that physician is not possible. This permission may be obtained in several ways: Blanket permission may be granted by action of the medical staff. In some hospitals, blanket permission to contact patients is not granted for any number of reasons. It then becomes necessary to obtain permission on a case by case basis. D. Follow-up information on all patients named on the follow-up control list should be pursued in an orderly and stepwise fashion: Pull and review charts or any internal lists which would indicate these patients' vital status and/or disease status. Identify any patients who have returned to this hospital and record the most current date of last contact. Review these charts for any other follow-up information related to the patient's cancer progression or treatment and update the patient's record in CPDMS.net. Send letters to the primary following physician designated for the patients remaining on the list. Labels can be generated by CPDMS.net to the appropriate contact person for each patient needing follow- up. When letters are returned with current information about your cancer patients, update the patient's record in CPDMS.net.5. 6. 7. 8. If no new information is available, or no response at all is returned, pursue alternate contacts for information about these patients. These may be other physicians, relatives or friends of the patients, or the patients themselves. If there are any patients remaining on the control list for whom no current information has been located, you may be able to confirm the patient's vital status through various public agencies: The Department of Motor Vehicles, The Department of Vital Statistics, Voters' Registration, Social Security Administration, U.S. Office of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Postal Service, newspapers, etc. If all leads fail to return any current information, re-contact the patient's original or last known physician before you consider them \"lost\" to follow-up. Record all follow-up efforts and the resulting information in the text of the patient's record. Changes To The Manual A. CHANGES RESULTING FROM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COC's FORDS MANUAL IN 2003: Several data items previously required by CoC were deleted in their FORDS Manual, and many new data items were added. CPDMS.net has not deleted any data items with its 2003 release. However, the required new elements have been added. One of these is an ACoS approval flag, which a hospital user may set in order to invoke data entry processes that provide access to and edit checking on all CoC required fields. Otherwise, only KCR data collection requirements will be enforced by the software routines. The greatest impact of the FORDS Manual is in the collection of therapy information. The site specific surgery codes have been revised significantly since the CoC's 1998 surgery code revisions. Due to ACoS and SEER reporting requirements, KCR will maintain the old data values in the ROADS surgery fields. These will be identified by the acronym 'ROADS' beside the field name and they be coded for diagnoses priormust to 1/1/2003. Three of the new CoC data items - Surgery at Primary Site, Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery, and Surgery at Distant Sites - will have the acronym 'FORDS' beside the new field name and they must be coded for diagnoses on or after 1/1/2003. The other ROADS surgery data items will either be discontinued (Surgical Approach, Number of Regional Lymph Nodes Removed, Reconstruction) or converted to generic codes in FORDS, applicable to all sites (Surgical Margins). There are eight new Radiation Therapy data items required in FORDS. These will be available only to hospitals that set their ACoS flag to 'approved.' These are required by KCR. Finally, there will be new and separate therapy records specifically for non-definitive surgeries,NOT Hormone Therapy, Immunotherapy, and Transplants/Endocrine procedures. The 'Other' therapy codes and definitions will be converted and revised accordingly. B. CHANGES FOR 2004: The two most significant changes for 2004 are the implementation of the collaborative staging system and the inclusion of benign and bordering intracranial and CNS tumors in the list of reportable conditions. C. CHANGES FOR 2005: The SEER Rx program is now used to categorize systemic treatments as chemotherapy, hormone therapy or immunotherapy. The most significant change is the classification of drugs according to their mechanism of action. These drugs are now coded as chemotherapy: - cytostatic agents, including monoclonal antibodies (such as Rituxan and Herceptin), growth factor inhibitors (such as Iressa), anti-angiogenesis agents (such as thalidomide, Avastin, and as Vidaza and Alimta) The SEER Rx program used to classify drugs may be found at . www.seer.cancer.gov/tools/seerrx D. CHANGES FOR 2006 The CoC no longer requires class of case 0 cases to be followed by the registry or AJCC staged by the physician. However, KCR continues to require registries to follow these cases. Four additional comorbidity fields were added and the data item \"Systemic Therapy/Surgery Sequence\" was added. E. CHANGES FOR 2007 The SEER were implemented effective with cases diagnosed in 2007. These site-specific rules 2007 Multiple Primary and Histology Coding rules for determining the number of primary malignancies in solid tumors supersede all previous multiple primary rules. (Existing rules for determining the number of primary malignancies for lymphatic and hematopoietic diseases, and for benign and borderline intracranial and CNS tumors, remain in effect.) Along with the new Multiple Primary rules, six additional data items were introduced in 2007: Ambiguous Terminology, Date of Conclusive Diagnosis, Multiplicity Counter, Date of Multiple Tumors, Type of Multiple Tumors, and Managing Physician. Per ACoS requirements, the National Provider Identification (NPI) numbers were initiated in 2007. These are unique 10-digit identifiers for health care providers who bill Medicare (CMS) for services. The NPI data values are stored in the two support files: physician list and institution list. A lookup for NPI numbers is available at . https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/ F. CHANGES FOR 2008 For cases diagnosed in 2008, the CoC considers pathologic staging information to be adequately collected by the CS items, and thus physician-assigned pathologic AJCC staging is no longer required to be collected. Clinical AJCC staging continues to be required for ACoS approved facilities. Collaborative Stage version 01.04.00 was released and is available at . http://cancerstaging.org/cstage/Pages/default.aspxClarifications regarding the coding of embolization were issued by the CoC, NPCR, and SEER. Chemoembolization, in which tumor blood-flow is blocked by other means and a chemotherapy drug is injected into the tumor, is coded as chemotherapy. Radioembolization, in which tumor blood-flow is blocked and tiny radioactive beads or coils are injected into the tumor, is coded as radiation therapy. When blood flow to the tumor is blocked using other chemicals or materials (such as alcohol or acrylic), without the use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, code this treatment in the 'Other' therapy field. Pre-surgical embolization of hypervascular tumors using particles, coils, or alcohol is NOT coded as therapy. This type of embolization is performed to make subsequent surgical resection easier, not as cancer-directed therapy. G. CHANGES FOR 2009 Beginning with 2009 diagnoses, maiden name should be collected, when known. HER2 test results will be recorded for breast cases. Cases which are diagnosed will use the actual date of diagnosis, rather than the date of birth (note: this situation requires an IF15 override).in utero Two additional optional following physician fields were added. The codes 209.0-209.3 and 511.81 were added to the ICD-9-CM casefinding list, and a supplemental list of codes to aid in casefinding was made available as . Appendix M - Supplemental ICD-10-CM Codes H. CHANGES FOR 2010 Collaborative Stage version 2.0 was implemented, which entailed a great number of changes and the conversion of CS data elements for all diagnoses from 2004-2009. SSF 7-25 were added at this time. The 7th Edition was adopted for coding the T, N, AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, M, and Stage Group fields. The Hematopoietic Database (which includes the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Case Reportability and Coding Manual) was released and replaced all previous coding rules for these malignancies. New histology codes which are not in ICD-O-3 were added to the Histology Support File and the following diseases were changed from borderline to malignant: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (9751/3), T and myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (9975/3). Several new fields were added, including Radiation/Systemic Tx Sequence, Grade Path System, Grade Path Value, Lymph-Vascular Invasion, Treatment Status, Date Case Completed-COC, Surgical Approach 2010, Place of Diagnosis, and Reason No Non-definitive Surgery. Modifications were made to the existing items Race 1-5, Class of Case, Laterality, Diagnostic Confirmation, AJCC Staging, and Radiation Number of Treatments to This Volume. I. CHANGES FOR 2011 Collaborative Stage version 02.03 was implemented. Cases diagnosed from January 1, 2011 forward were coded using the new version. Version 02.03 introduced one new schema (for myeloma/plasma cell malignancies), added and revised codes, incorporated new algorithms, and revised some coding instructions. It also added the following new SSF's to existing schema: SSF15 for for testis. FORDS 2011 requires that comorbidities be coded using ICD-10, upon a facility's transition from ICD-9. Minor revisions were made to the surgery codes for liver, breast, and prostate. A \"Do Not Contact\" flag was added as a patient level field so that registries may mark patients who should never be directly contacted. J. CHANGES FOR 2013 Country codes were added to address current, address at diagnosis, place of birth and place of death. (See new ). Secondary APPENDIX B diagnosis 1-10 were added to capture co-morbidities when they are recorded in the medical record using ICD-10 codes. These data items are no longer required: Ambiguous Terminology, Date of Conclusive Diagnosis, Multiplicity Counter, Date of Multiple Tumors, and Type of Multiple Tumors Reported as One Primary. Four Clinical Trial data items were added (type, date, site, and text) and these items are repeated to capture up to four different clinical trials per patient. Also in 2013, these drugs, which were coded as chemotherapy, are now considered immunotherapy: - Alemtuzumab/Campath - Bevacizumab/Avastin - Rituximab - Trastuzumab/Herceptin Perjeta Cetuximab/Erbitux K. CHANGES FOR 2014 Collaborative Stage Version 02.05 was implemented. Cases diagnosed from January 1, 2014 forward must be entered using CS V02.05. This version contained a few corrections to the mapping algorithm, and several clarifications to the coding instructions with this version, Grade Path System and Grade Path Value were discontinued, as well as all Site Specific Factors that had been defined by never required by any standard setter. The Tumor Grade field was changed slightly in 2014, with all standard setters (COC, SEER, and NPCR) in agreement with the new coding instructions. New preferred terms and synonyms were added to the ICD-0-3 histology table.A revised version of the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Database was released in 2014. L. CHANGES FOR 2015 Two new code values were added to the SEX field: 5 - Transsexual, natal male and 6 - Transsexual, natal female. Pathological stage data elements T, N, M, and stage group are now required to be coded. Carcinoids of the appendix are now considered reportable (8240/3). Nature teratomas of the testes in adults is malignant and reportable (9080/3). It is not reportable for pre-pubescent males. New terms for pancreatic cancers are now reportable: Non-invasive mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) of the pancreas with grade unless specified as NET grade 1 (8240/3) or NET grade 2 (8249/3). Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas is reprotable as 8452/3. Directly coded Summary Stage 2000, Treatment Follow-back Text, and Treatment Plan were added as new data items. M. CHANGES FOR 2016 Code 3 for the data field SEX is now defined as 'Other, (intersex, disorders of sexual development/DSD).' New data items in 2016 include Mets at diagnosis - Distant Lymph Node Mets at diagnosis - Other (Other than Bone, Brain, Liver, Lung, Distant Lymph Nodes) Tumor size - Clinical Tumor size - Pathological Tumor size - Summary Staged by - Clinical and Staged-by Pathological have been expanded to 2-digit codes to include more physician specialties. Data entered before 2016 was converted to the new 2-digit codes. The valid codes for the AJCC T, N, and M categories now contain the prefix 'c' for clinical or 'p' for pathologic. Data entered before 2016 was converted to include these prefixes. Although CoC and NPCR have discontinued the collection of collaborative stage data, KCR will continue to abstract these fields in 2016. However, CS derived values will no longer be displayed for cases diagnosed on or after 01-01-2016. General Rules Multiple Primaries Use the following references to determine the number of cases to be abstracted: Solid Tumors -- Use the SEER for solid tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2007 Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules 2007. Use the in effect prior to 2007 for solid tumors diagnosed before 2007. SEER Multiple Primary rules Hematopoietic Malignancies -- Use the Hem Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Case Reportability and Coding Manual and the for cases of this type diagnosed on or after January 1, 2010. Use , 'Rules for Determining Multiple atopoietic Database Appendix A Primaries for Lymphatic and Hematopoietic Diseases,' for cases diagnosed prior to that date. Hematopoietic And Lymphoid Malignancy Coding Rules New reportability instructions and data collection rules for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms go into effect for cases diagnosed beginning January 1, 2010. The Hematopoietic Database is an electronic tool developed to assist in screening for reportable cases and determining reportability requirements, as well as determination of multiple primaries. The database contains abstracting and coding information for all hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms (9590/3-9992/3). Two tools have been developed for use beginning in 2010: The Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Case Reportability and Coding Manual The Hematopoietic Database The is embedded in the Hematopoietic Database (Hematopoietic Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Case Reportability and Coding Manual DB). This manual contains reportability instructions and rules for determining the number of primaries, the primary site and histology, and the cell lineage or phenotype. The manual also includes several appendices. Use the instructions and rules within the manual first. The Hematopoietic DB is used when the rules specifically instruct the abstractor to refer to the DB or when the registrar has used all of the rules in the manual. The Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Database was updated in 2014, but all coding changes are effective with 2010 cases forward.The manual and database are available online and for download from the SEER web site: . http://seer.cancer.gov/tools/heme/index.html Lymphatic And Hematopoietic Multiple Primary Rules If the physician clearly states that a hematopoietic diagnosis is a new primary, use that information. Otherwise, the determination of multiple primaries should be done using the guidelines in . Appendix A Rules: 1. Topography is NOT considered in determining multiple primaries of lymphatic and hematopoietic diseases. 2. The time interval between diagnoses does NOT enter into the decision. Appendix A was completely revised with the implementation of ICD-O-3 and the newer table for determining multiple hematopoietic malignancies is effective with cancers diagnosed between 2001-2010. Appendix A contains links to both the revised table and the previous table, which is to be used for pre-2001 diagnoses. One of the major changes that took place with the implementation of ICD-O-3 was the inclusion of newly reportable hematopoietic diseases (myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes). These cases are accessioned or sequenced not unless they were diagnosed on or after , even if the patient received treatment for this disease after that date. January 1, 2001 NOTE: If a reportable hematopoietic malignancy is diagnosed after January 1, 2001 in the same person who has another hematopoietic disease diagnosed prior to 2001, use Appendix A to determine if the second condition must be abstracted. If the cross check is D, it should be abstracted. If the cross check is S, it should not be abstracted if the first condition was abstracted; it should be abstracted if the first condition was not. Mph Coding Rules For Solid Tumors The SEER 2007 Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules are effective with cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 2007. They contain site-specific rules for lung, breast, colon, melanoma of the skin, head and neck, kidney, renal pelvis/ureter/bladder, and malignant and benign brain tumors. An additional set of rules addresses the specific and general rules for all other sites. The multiple primary rules guide and standardize the process of determining the number of primaries to be abstracted. The histology rules contain detailed histology coding instruction. The complete Multiple Primary and Histology Coding rules may be downloaded from the SEER web site at: http://seer.cancer.gov/tool . s/mphrules/download.html The SEER 2007 Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules do not apply to hematopoietic primaries (lymphoma and leukemia M9590-9989). Use the Site-specific rules for the following primary site groups: Brain, malignant Brian, benign Breast Colon Head and Neck Kidney Lung Malignant Melanoma of the skin Renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, and other urinary Use the Other Sites Rules for solid malignant tumors that occur in primary sites not covered by site-specific rules. Pre 2007 Multiple Primary Rules For Solid Tumors For solid malignant tumors and benign/borderline brain tumors diagnosed before 2007, use the SEER Multiple Primary Rules below, which are based on the (ICD-O-3), to determine if a diagnosis is a single or multiple primary. International Classification of Diseases for Oncology 1. Use the definitions below under the heading \"Primary Site\" to decide whether the tumor(s) involve one site or multiple sites. 2. Follow the instructions under the heading \"Rules for Coding Histology of Solid Tumors Diagnosed Prior to 2007\" in item #30090 ( ) to decide whether the tumor(s) are a single histology or mixed/multiple histologies.Histology 3. Use the\"Rules for Determining Multiple Primary Cancers\" to decide whether the case should be abstracted as one primary or multiple primaries. 1. Definitions for determining a single site and a single histology.Primary Site A single site is defined as the same first three characters in the topography code for the sites listed below: Code Description C03 Gum C04 Floor of primary EXAMPLE: The trigone of bladder (C67.0) and lateral wall of bladder (C67.2) are considered subsites of the bladder, and would be treated as one site. A tumor or lesion involving both subsites would be coded either to overlapping sites of bladder (C67.8), or bladder, NOS (C67.9). A single site is defined as the same fourth character in the topography code for the anatomic sites skin C47Peripheral and autonomic nervous system C49Connective tissue EXAMPLE: The transverse colon (C18.4), and the descending colon (C18.6), are considered separate sites. The only EXCEPTION to this is familial polyposis or polyposis coli involving more than one segment of the colon. This is abstracted as only one primary, coded to colon, NOS (C18.9). If the familial polyposis involves both the colon and the rectum, abstract as one primary with site code C19.9. A single site involves more than one three character category in the topography coding scheme for the anatomic sites listed below: Code Description Code To:C01 and C02 Tongue C02.9 C05 and C06 Palate unspecified parts of mouthC06.9 C07 and C08 Parotid and other C24.9 C30 C31 Nasal and and C57.7-C57.9 Vulva, vagina, other female genital organsC57.9 C56 and C57.0-C57.4 Ovary, fallopian tube, broad and adnexaC56.9 if ovary; C57.9 if other C60 and C63 Penis other unspecified male genital C64, C65, C66, and C68 glands and related structuresC75.9 EXAMPLE: Base of tongue (C01.9), and border of tongue (C02.1), are considered subsites of the tongue, and would be treated as one site - either overlapping lesion of tongue (C02.8) or tongue, NOS (C02.9). Each side of a paired organ is considered a separate site. Tumors arising on different sides of a paired organ are considered separate primaries, unless the tumor on one side is stated to be metastatic. Exceptions are bilateral involvement of the ovaries in which a single histology is reported, bilateral retinoblastomas, and bilateral Wilms' tumors, which are all considered single primaries. Histologic Type When the of the ICD-O-3 morphology codes are , the lesions are the except for FIRST THREE DIGITS IDENTICAL SAME HISTOLOGY, lymphatic and hematopoietic diseases and benign and borderline CNS tumors. Exception: Code the following as single primaries with a single histology, even though the first three digits of the ICD-O-3 morphology codes differ: Bladder lesions (8120-8130) Breast lesions (ductal carcinoma - 8500/3) (lobular carcinoma 8520/3) Code to 8522/3 Exception: Non-small cell carcinoma (8046/3) is considered the same as 8041/3-8045/3, even though the first three digits are thenot same. Exception: Lymphatic and hematopoietic diseases (see and use \"Pre-2010 Lymphatic and Hematopoietic Multiple Primary Rules\" App to determine multiple primaries).endix AException: Benign and borderline CNS tumors (see the section \"Rules for Determining Multiple Primaries for Benign and Borderline Intracranial and CNS Tumors\" below for multiple primary rules). Simultaneous/synchronous diagnosis Diagnoses that occur within two months of each other are considered simultaneous. 2. Rules for Determining Multiple Primary Cancers ( except for lymphatic and hematopoietic diseases and benign and borderline CNS ).tumors Single Primary 1. A single lesion of one histologic type is considered a single primary even if the lesion crosses site boundaries. 2. A single lesion with multiple histologic types is to be considered as a single primary. The most frequent combinations are listed in ICD-O-3. For example, combination terms such as \"adenosquamous carcinoma (8560/3)\" or \"combined small cell-large cell carcinoma (8045/3)\" are included. Any of these mixed histologies are to be considered one primary. 3. A single lesion with an in-situ component and an invasive component is considered a single primary. 4. a) If a new cancer of the same histology as an earlier one is diagnosed in the same site within two months, consider this to be the same primary cancer. b) If a new cancer of the same histology is diagnosed in the same site after two months, consider this new cancer a separate primary unless stated to be recurrent or metastatic. Exception to 4b: If there is an in-situ cancer followed by an invasive cancer in the same site with the same histology more than two months apart, report as two primaries even if stated to be a recurrence. NOTE: Bladder cancers, site codes C67.0 - C67.9, with histology codes 8120-8130 may be abstracted at most twice; one abstract for the first in-situ lesion if it precedes the first invasive lesion, and one for the first invasive lesion (if diagnosed at least 2 months later than the in-situ lesion). This also applies to adenocarcinoma of the prostate. These are reported at most only twice; once for the first in-situ lesion if it precedes the first invasive lesion (these are very rare) and once for the first invasive lesion. NOTE: Kaposi's sarcoma (9140/3) is reported only once. Kaposi's sarcoma is coded to the site in which it arises. If Kaposi's sarcoma arises in skin and another site simultaneously, code to skin (C44._). If no primary site is stated, code to skin (C44._). 5. Multiple lesions of the same histologic type: a. Simultaneous multiple lesions of the same histologic type within the same site will be considered a single primary. Further, if one lesion has a behavior code of in-situ and another has a behavior code of malignant (invasive), still consider this to be a single primary whose behavior is malignant. b. Multiple lesions of the same histologic type occurring in different sites are considered to be separate primaries unless stated to be metastatic. Exception: Adenocarcinoma in multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon. NOTE: For paired organs, each side is considered a separate site. c. If only one histologic type is reported and if both sides of a paired site are involved within two months of diagnosis, a determination must be made as to whether the patient has one or two independent primaries. If it is determined that there are two independent primaries, two records are to be submitted, each with the appropriate laterality and extent of disease information. There are THREE EXCEPTIONS to this rule. Simultaneous bilateral involvement of the ovaries in which there is only a single histology is to be considered one primary and laterality is to be coded '4'. Bilateral retinoblastomas and bilateral Wilms' tumor are always considered single primaries (whether simultaneous or not), and laterality is coded as '4'. d. If one histologic type is reported in one side of a paired organ and a different histologic type is reported in the other paired organ, consider these two primaries unless there is a statement to the contrary. EXAMPLE: If a ductal lesion occurs in one breast and a lobular lesion occurs in the opposite breast, these are considered to be two primaries. 6. Multiple lesions of different histologic types: a. Multiple lesions of mixed histologies in the same site are a single primary. EXAMPLE: Tumors with predominant features or combination codes such as combined small cell-large cell carcinoma 8045/3.b. Multiple lesions of different histologic types within a single site are to be considered separate primaries whether occurring simultaneously or at different times. Exception: For multiple lesions within a single site occurring within two months, if one lesion is stated to be carcinoma, NOS, adenocarcinoma, NOS, Melanoma, NOS, or sarcoma, NOS and the second lesion is a more specific term, such as large cell carcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, or spindle cell sarcoma, consider this to be a single primary and code to the more specific term. Exception: Within each breast, combinations of ductal and lobular carcinoma occurring within two months of each other are to be considered a single primary and the histology coded according to ICD-O-3. (8522/3) Exception: Thyroid carcinomas, reported with two separate carcinomas - one papillary and the other follicular - should be reported as one primary with the mixed histology code 8340/3. c. Multiple lesions of different histologic types occurring in different sites are considered separate primaries whether occurring simultaneously or at different times.

Multiple Multiple Simultaneous or different Multiple *See the preceding site and histology rules for definition of \"multiple\". Rules for determining multiple primaries for benign and borderline intracranial and CNS tumors (C70.0 histology, and laterality must be considered. A.. - Primary Site A single site is defined as the same character (subsite) in the topography code for the anatomic sites listed C70 Pineal, Craniopharyngeal If different tumors arise in different subsites, then they are separate primaries. Example: A benign tumor in the parietal lobe (C71.3) and a separate benign tumor in the frontal lobe (C71.1). Count and abstract as separate primaries. Example: Meningioma lobe and separate primaries. Exception: If one subsite is non-specific (such as brain, NOS C71.9), and other is specific in same 3 character category (such as C71.__), count as one primary only. For example, biopsy of temporal lobe (C71.2) shows benign tumor and diagnosis from CT scan states \"neoplasm of brain\" (C71.9). Report one primary only (C71.2). B. -Histology If separate tumors have different histologies, then they are separate primaries. To determine whether tumors have different histologies, code the histology of each tumor and look them up in the table below. Histologic Groupings To Determine Same Histology histology code is in the table above and , abstract as one primary. codes are the same at the three-digit level Example: Patient has clear cell meningioma (9538/1) of the cerebral meninges and a separate transitional cell meningioma (9537/0) in another part of the same hemisphere. Count and abstract as one primary. 2. If the two histology codes are in the same category of the table, count as one primary. Example: Patient has a ganglioglioma (9505/1) of the cerebellum a neurocytoma (9506/1) of the cerebellopontine angle (C71.6). Count and abstract as one primary. 3. If the histology codes are in different categories of the table, count and abstract as separate primaries. Example: Patient has a choroid plexus papilloma (9444/1) of the third ventricle (C71.5). Count and abstract as separate primaries. 4. If one histology is in the benign brain histology table and the other is not, compare codes at the three-digit level. If they are the same, count as one primary. If they are different, count as two primaries. Example: Patient has a subependymal glioma (9383/1) diagnosed on needle biopsy in August, and at resection in September the diagnosis is subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (9384/1). Count and abstract as one primary. Example: Patient has a Pacinian tumor (9507/0) diagnosed in March and a dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (9413/1) of the occipital lobe diagnosed in July. Count and abstract as separate primaries. C. -Laterality For each non-malignant (and malignant) primary brain and CNS tumor for the sites shown below and with a diagnostic date on or after January 1, 2004, code laterality using codes 1-4 or 9. Midline tumors are coded 9. Prior to 1-1-04 diagnoses, primary brain and CNS tumors were coded '0' for laterality. CNS Sites for C72.5 Cranial nerve, NOS 1. If laterality is same side, one side unknown or not applicable, and same subsite and same histology, then abstract as one primary. 2. If laterality is both sides, abstract separate primaries. Example: Benign tumors (same histology) in left and right temporal lobes. Count and abstract as separate primaries. D. -Timing If a new non-malignant tumor is diagnosed in the same subsite with the same histology as a previous one, then one primary is abstracted, regardless of time elapsed. (For tumors with an diagnosis prior to 1-1-04, do not abstract non-malignant CNS initial recurrent tumors.) E. - Multiple lesions with different behavior codes 1. Non-malignant tumor followed by malignant tumor: abstract separate primaries regardless of timing. 2. Malignant tumor followed by non-malignant tumor: abstract separate primaries regardless of timing. 3 . Benign tumor transforms to malignancy (rare occurrence): create second abstract for malignancy. Example: Patient is diagnosed and treated for choroid plexus papilloma (9390/0) of right lateral ventricle in June 2004. Eighteen months later, patient is symptomatic again and re-biopsy of same area is reported as choroid plexus carcinoma (9390/3). Count and abstract as two primaries.

If the patient does not have a social security number, use the formula below to assign a unique temporary number. NOTE: The social security number is the main element used in identifying patients, matching information, etc., and must be recorded accurately for every patient entered in the system. FORMULA: Temporary \"social security\" numbers are assigned only to patients not possessing a verifiable social security number. Use the initials of the patient's first, middle and last names, followed by digits representing the birth date. (Use zero when the patient's middle initial is unknown.) Thus, John Brown, born January 21, 1946, would be issued the following number: J0B - 01 - 2146 Where month, day or year of birth is not known, enter \"99\". Temporary numbers should be checked for duplication within your hospital's cancer registry before the patient is accessioned. If the temporary number works out to be exactly the same as that of a different patient, the registrar should change the middle initial to the number \"1\". If there are more than two patients with the same temporary number, continue to substitute numbers in the middle initial in sequential order. [FYI: If the Medicare billing number is a Social Security Number followed by a B or D, this indicates that the SSN belongs to the spouse of the patient.] Last Name Organization Field Name IDRequired 20 Enter the patient's last name in the spaces provided. If the name exceeds the number of spaces provided, enter as much as possible. If during the course of follow-up, the patient's name changes, update the record with the current name.

These data are , and need not be recorded at all.optional 3. Blanks are allowed in the last name field, but they must be used consistently in order to match patients at the central data base. Therefore, the following rules are established: a. When a patient has two last names, or a hyphenated last name, you may type both in the last name field separated by a blank space. b. Patients with two-part last names, such as VAN HORN or ST JOHN, may have a space between the two parts, but no special punctuation marks. c. Names like 'MCCOY' or 'O'BRYAN' should be typed 'MCCOY' or 'OBRYAN' with no spaces and no punctuation.

These data are , and need not be recorded at all.optional 3. Blanks are allowed in the first name field, but they must be used consistently in order to match patients at the central data base. Therefore, the following rules are established: a. Patients with two-part first names, or two first names, may have them both recorded in the first name field, separated by a blank space. For example: MARY JO MARY ANN JOHN ED etc. b. Patients who go by their initials should have their first initial recorded in the first name field, and the second in the middle name field. For example: J.B. JONES would have 'J' in first name and 'B' in middle name. c. Patients with a name and an initial should have them recorded in separate fields. For example: H. EDWARD SMITH should have 'H' in first name and 'EDWARD' in middle name. Middle Name Organization Field Name IDRequired Middle Name (MidName) 10 Enter the patient's middle name in the spaces provided.

Do not code this field from the medical record. A list of all ICD-10 codes is available online at http:// . www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ Underlying cause of death codes usually have four digits. Some codes may have an optional fifth digit. The decimal point will already appear on the form and on the data entry screen. If a fourth digit for the underlying cause of death is \"X\", \"blank\", or \"-\" use '9' for the fourth digit. In Kentucky, the state central registry will match all death certificates with the central database. A file of matched patient records will be generated for each Kentucky hospital. This file will automatically be loaded into CPDMS.net and will be used by each hospital to update that hospital's patients with date of death and cause of death from the death certificate. It is not necessary to have a copy of the death certificate as long as the official code for the underlying cause of death is available. You may use the Cause of Death code obtained from a linkage with the National Death Index, or from an out-of-state data exchange cancer report.

This is a five character field. After the \"C\", enter the three digit code; the decimal point is already in the correct position. The International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) , represents an extension of Chapter II of the ICD-10 coding 3rd edition reference. ICD-O permits the coding of all neoplasms by topography, morphology, and cell behavior -- providing greater detail than that permitted with ICD-9 or ICD-10 coding schemes. The structure of the ICD-O reference book contains three major sections: Topography - A numerical list of anatomic sites adapted from the malignant neoplasms section of Chapter II of ICD-10. The topographic terms have 3-digit code numbers preceded by a \"C\" which run from C00.0 to C80.9. Morphology - A numerical list of histologic terms that is a revised and expanded version of the morphology section of The Manual of Tumor Nomenclature and Coding. The ICD-O, 3rd edition includes new histologic types that have come into the literature since 1990. It has revised the Leukemia and Lymphoma sections and now includes several hematopoietic diseases that were previously considered borderline. Alphabetic Index - A list of anatomic sites, histologic terms and selected tumor-like lesions and conditions. Refer to the introductory pages of the , for a more detailed discussion of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition differences between ICD-O and ICD-10, as well as for rules governing the appropriate assignment of ICD-O codes. See also for APPENDIX J errata and clarifications to ICD-O-3rd edition. Coding Instructions for Solid Tumors Site-Specific Topography Terms See the Coding Guidelines for Topography and Morphology in the introduction of the ICD-O-3 for additional details. 1. Unless otherwise instructed, use all available information to code the site. 2. Code the site in which the primary tumor originated, even if it extends onto/into an adjacent subsite. Example 1: Final diagnosis is adenocarcinoma of the upper lobe of the right lung. Code the topography to lung, upper lobe (C341). Example 2: The patient has a 4 cm tumor in the right breast. The tumor originated in the upper inner quadrant and extends into the lower inner quadrant. Code the primary site to upper inner quadrant of breast (C502). Example 3: Patient has a right branchial cleft cyst; the pathology report identifies an adenocarcinoma arising in an ectopic focus of thyroid tissue within the branchial cleft cyst. Thyroidectomy pathology is negative. Code the primary site to branchial cleft (C104). Example 4: The patient had a total hysterectomy with a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ten years ago for non-cancer reasons. She now has widespread cystadenocarcinoma in the peritoneum. Code the primary site to peritoneum, NOS (C482). (The chart may or may not state that the patient has extra-ovarian carcinoma.) Example 5: Pathology report shows adenocarcinoma arising in a patch of endometriosis on the sigmoid colon. Code the primary site to sigmoid colon (C187), the site in which the cancer originated. 3. Code the last digit of the primary site code to '8' when a single tumor overlaps an adjacent subsite(s) of an organ and the point of origin cannot be determined. Example: The patient has a 5cm tumor that involves the dorsal surface and anterior 2/3 of tongue. Code the primary site to C028 (overlapping lesion of tongue). 4. Code the site of the invasive tumor when there is an invasive tumor and in situ tumor in different subsites of the same anatomic site. Example 1: Patient has an invasive breast tumor in the upper-outer quadrant of the left breast and in situ tumor in multiple quadrants of the left breast. Code the primary site to C504 (upper outer quadrant of breast). Example 2: Patient has in situ Paget disease of the right nipple and invasive duct carcinoma of the lower inner quadrant of the right breast. Code the primary site to C503 (lower inner quadrant). 5. Code the last digit of the primary site code to '9' for single primaries, when multiple tumors arise in different subsites of the same anatomic site and the point of origin cannot be determined. Example 1: During a TURB, the physician describes multiple papillary tumors in the bladder neck (C675) and the lateral wall of the bladder (C672). Code the primary site as bladder, NOS (C679). Example 2: Patient has an infiltrating duct tumor in the upper outer quadrant (C504) of the right breast and another infiltrating duct carcinoma inthe lower inner (C503) quadrant of the right breast. Code the primary site as breast, NOS (C509). 6. Some histology/behavior terms in ICD-O-3 have a related site code in parentheses; for example: Hepatoma (C220). a. Code the site as documented in the medical record and ignore the suggested ICD-O-3 code when a primary site is specified in the medical record. Example: The pathology report says \"infiltrating duct carcinoma of the head of the pancreas.\" The listing in ICD-O-3 is infiltrating duct carcinoma 8500/3 (C50_). Code the primary site to head of pancreas (C250), NOT to breast (C50_) as suggested by the ICD-O-3. b. Use the site code suggested by ICD-O-3 when the primary site is the same as the site code suggested or the primary site is unknown Example 1: The biopsy is positive for hepatoma, and no information is available about the primary site. Code the primary site to liver (C220) as suggested by ICD-O-3. Example 2: An excision of the right axillary nodes reveals metastatic infiltrating duct carcinoma. The right breast is negative. The ICD-O-3 shows infiltrating duct carcinoma (8500) with a suggested site of breast (C50_). Code the primary site as breast, NOS (C509). 7. Code the primary site, not the metastatic site. If a tumor is metastatic and the primary site is unknown, code the primary site as unknown (C809). 8. See the site-specific Coding Guidelines in for primary site coding guidelines for the following sites: Appendix C Bladder Kaposi sarcoma Breast Lung Colon Rectosigmoid, rectum Esophagus 9. See below for primary site coding guidelines for Sarcoma. 10. Code C422 (Spleen) as the primary site for angiosarcoma of spleen with mets to bone marrow. 11. Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST): Code the primary site to the location where the malignant GIST originated. 12. In the , assign the codes listed for these primary sites absence of any additional information Code Primary site C445 Anal margin C162 Angle of the stomach C068 Book-leaf lesion (mouth) C000 Colored / lipstick portion of C720 Distal conus C021 Edge of bile duct 13. When the medical record does not contain enough information to assign a primary site:a. Consult a physician advisor to assign the site code. b. Use the NOS category for the organ system or the Ill-Defined Sites (C760-C768) if the physician advisor cannot identify a primary site. c. Code Unknown Primary Site (C809) if there is not enough information to assign an NOS or Ill-Defined Site category. Sarcoma The majority of sarcomas arise in mesenchymal or connective tissues that are located in the musculoskeletal system, which includes the fat, muscles, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, nerves, bones, and cartilage. The default code for sarcomas of unknown primary site is C499 rather than C809. Sarcomas may also arise in the walls of hollow organs and in the viscera covering an organ. Code the primary site to the organ of origin. Example: The pathology identifies a carcinosarcoma of the uterine corpus. Code the primary site to corpus uteri (C549). Coding Instructions for Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms (9590/3-9992/3) See the for instructions on coding the primary site for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms. Hematopoietic Manual for Coding Record histology using the ICD-O-3 codes in the Numeric Lists/Morphology section in the Alphabetic Index (ICD-O-3, pp. 105-218). Follow the coding rules outlined on pages 20 through 40 of ICD-O-3. Use the when coding the histology for reportable solid malignant SEER 2007 Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules tumors. These rules are effective for cases diagnosed January 1, 2007, or later. Do not use these rules to abstract cases diagnosed prior to this date; for these cases, see the section below entitled \"Rules for Coding Histology Prior to 2007.\" Use the when coding Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Case Reportability and Coding Manual histology for reportable hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies diagnosed January 1, 2010 onward. NOTE: The Hematopoietic Database contains additional histologies which are not found in ICD-O-3, but are valid for use from 2010 forward. Review all pathology reports. Code the final pathologic diagnosis. EXCEPTION: If the final diagnosis tumor, NOS), then code the histology from the microscopic description or comment if it identifies a more specific histologic type (higher ICD-O-3 code) such as adenocarcinoma, amelanotic melanoma, or spindle cell sarcoma. The codes for cancer, NOS (8000) and carcinoma, NOS (8010) are not interchangeable. If the physician says that the patient has carcinoma, then code carcinoma, NOS (8010). Note that the determination of multiple primaries for benign and borderline intracranial and CNS tumors is based on histologic groupings. See the table and rules below for histologic groupings for non-malignant brain and CNS tumors. See Table of Specific Histologies that should not be coded to ill-defined sites (C76._). Rules for Coding the Histology of Solid Tumors Diagnosed Prior to 2007 Coding Instructions Use all of the information for a single primary to code the histology. 1. If there is no tumor specimen, code the histology described by the medical practitioner. 2. Use the histology stated in the final diagnosis from the pathology report. Use the pathology from the procedure that resected the majority of theprimary tumor. If a more specific histologic type is definitively described in the microscopic portion of the pathology report or the comment, code the more specific diagnosis. 3. Cases reported to KCR cannot have a metastatic (/6) behavior code. If the only pathology specimen is from a metastatic site, code the appropriate histology code and the malignant behavior code /3. The primary site and its metastatic site(s) have the same basic histology. Histology Coding Rules for Single Tumor \u00b7 The rules are in hierarchical order. Rule 1 has the highest priority. \u00b7 Use the rules in priority order. \u00b7 Use the first rule that applies to the case. (Do not apply any additional rules.) 1. Code the histology if only one type is mentioned in the pathology report. 2. Code the invasive histology when both invasive and in situ tumor are present. Example: Pathology report reads infiltrating ductal carcinoma and cribriform ductal carcinoma insitu. Code the invasive histology 8500/3. Exception: If the histology of the invasive component is an 'NOS' term (e.g., carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, melanoma, sarcoma), then code the histology of the specific term associated with the insitu component and an invasive behavior code. 3. Use a mixed histology code if one exists Examples of mixed codes: (This is not a complete list, these are examples only) 8490 Mixed tumor, NOS 9085 Mixed germ cell tumor Teratocarcinoma, embryonal carcinoma and teratoma 4. Use a combination histology code if one exists Examples of combination codes: (This is not a complete list; these are examples only) 8255 Renal cell carcinoma, mixed clear cell and chromophobe types 8523 Infiltrating duct carcinoma mixed with other types of carcinoma 8524 Infiltrating lobular carcinoma mixed with other types of carcinoma 8560 Adenosquamous carcinoma 8045 Combined small cell carcinoma, combined small cell-large cell 5. Code the more specific term when one of the terms is 'NOS' and the other is a more specific description of the same histology. Example 1: Pathology report reads poorly differentiated carcinoma, probably squamous in origin. Code the histology as squamous cell carcinoma rather than the non-specific term \"carcinoma.\" Example 2: The pathology report from a nephrectomy reads renal cell carcinoma (8312) (renal cell identifies the affected organ system rather than the histologic cell type) in one portion of the report and clear cell carcinoma (8310) (a histologic cell type) in another section of the report. Code clear cell carcinoma (8310); renal cell carcinoma (8312) refers to the renal system rather than the cell type, so renal cell is the less specific code. 6. Code the majority of tumor. a. Based on the pathology report description of the tumor. b. Based on the use of majority terms. See definition for majority terms.Terms that mean the majority of tumor Terms that DO NOT mean the majority of tumor Predominantly With foci of With features of Focus of/focal Major Areas of Type1 Elements of With.....Differentiation1 Component1 Pattern (Only if written in College of American Pathologists [CAP] Protocol)2 Architecture (Only if written in College of American Pathologists [CAP] Protocol)2 Note: Examples of CAP protocols for specific primary sites may be found on the website: http://www.cap.org/ 7. Code the numerically higher ICD-O-3 code. This is the rule with the lowest priority and should be used infrequently. Histology Coding Rules for Multiple Tumors with Different Behaviors in Same Organ Reported as a Single Primary 1. Code the histology of the invasive tumor when one lesion is in situ (/2) and the other is invasive (/3). Example: At mastectomy for removal of a 2 cm invasive ductal carcinoma, an additional 5 cm area of intraductal carcinoma was noted. Code histology and behavior as invasive ductal carcinoma (8500/3). Histology Coding Rules for Multiple Tumors in Same Organ Reported as a Single Primary 1. Code the histology when multiple tumors have the same histology. 2. Code the histology to adenocarcinoma (8140/_; in situ or invasive) when there is an adenocarcinoma and an adenocarcinoma in a polyp (8210/_, 8261/_, 8263/) in the same segment of the colon or rectum. 3. Code the histology to carcinoma (8010/_; in situ or invasive) when there is a carcinoma and a carcinoma in a polyp (8210/_) in the same segment of the colon or rectum. 4. Use a combination code for the following: a. Bladder: Papillary and urothelial (transitional cell) Follicular and papillary carcinoma (8340) 5. Code the more specific term when one of the terms is 'NOS' and the other is a more specific description of the same histology. 6. Code all other multiple tumors with different histologies as multiple primaries. Histologic groupings to determine same histology for non-malignant brain tumors When there are multiple tumors, use the following table to determine if the tumors are the same histology or Histologic Group Table for Non-Malignant Brain Tumors 1. If both histologies are listed in the table, then a. Histologies that are in the same grouping or row in the table are the same histology. Note: Histologies that are in the same grouping are a progression, differentiation or subtype of a single histologic category. b. Histologies listed in different groupings (or rows) in the table are different histologies 2. If one or both of the histologies is not listed in the table, then a. If the ICD-O-3 codes for both histologies have the identical first three digits, the histologies are the same. b. If the first three digits of the ICD-O-3 histology code are different, the histology types are different. Specific Histologies with Ill-Defined Sites If any of the following histologies appears only with an ill-defined site description (e.g., \"abdominal\" or \"arm\"), code it to the tissue in which such tumors arise rather than the ill-defined region (C76._) of the body, which contains multiple tissues.

Grade codes for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms Terminology Grade Null cell; Non T-non B 7 NK cell (natural killer cell) 8 Grade unknown, not stated, or not applicable 9Solid Tumors Grade, Differentiation (Codes 1, 2, 3, 4, 9) Pathologic examination determines the grade, or degree of differentiation, of the tumor. For these cancers, the grade is a measurement of how closely the tumor cells resemble the parent tissue (organ of origin). Well-differentiated tumor cells closely resemble the tissue from the organ of origin. Poorly differentiated and undifferentiated tumor cells are disorganized and abnormal looking; they bear little (poorly differentiated) or no (undifferentiated) resemblance to the tissue from the organ of origin. These similarities/differences may be based on pattern (architecture), cytology, nuclear (or nucleolar) features, or a combination of these elements, depending upon the grading system that is used. Some grading systems use only pattern, for example Gleason grading in prostate. Others use only a nuclear grade (usually size, amount of chromatin, degree of irregularity, and mitotic activity). Fuhrman's grade for kidney is based only on nuclear features. Most systems use a combination of pattern and cytologic and nuclear features; for example Nottingham's for breast combines numbers for pattern, nuclear size and shape, and mitotic activity. The information from this data item is useful for determining prognosis and treatment. Pathologists describe the tumor grade using three systems or formats: 1. Two levels of similarity; also called a two-grade system 2. Three levels of similarity; also called a three-grade system (code according to \"Coding for solid tumors.\" a. Grade I, well b. Grade II, moderately c. Grade III, poorly (undifferentiated carcinoma is usually separated from this system, since \"poorly\" bears some, albeit little, similarity to the host tissue, while \"undifferentiated\" has none, e.g. Undifferentiated carcinoma). 3. Four levels of similarity; also called a four-grade system. The four-grade system describes the tumor as a. Grade I; also called well-differentiated b. Grade II; also called moderately differentiated c. Grade III; also called poorly differentiated d. Grade IV; also called undifferentiated or anaplastic Breast and prostate grades may convert differently than other sites. These exceptions are noted in \"Coding for Solid Tumors\", #7-8 below. Coding for Solid Tumors 1. Systemic treatment and radiation can alter a tumor's grade. Therefore, it is important to code grade based on information prior to neoadjuvant therapy even if grade is unknown. 2. Code the grade from the primary tumor only. a. Do NOT code grade based on metastatic tumor or recurrence. In the rare instance that tumor tissue extends contiguously to an adjacent site and tissue from the primary site is not available, code grade from the contiguous site. b. If primary site is unknown, code grade to 9. 3. Code the grade shown below (6th digit) for specific histologic terms that imply a grade. Carcinoma, undifferentiated (8021/34) Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, poorly differentiated (8631/33) Sertoli-Leydig cell with In situ and/or combined in situ/invasive components: a. If a grade is given for an in situ tumor, code it. Do NOT code grade for dysplasia such as high grade dysplasia. b. If there are both in situ and invasive components, code only the grade for the invasive portion even if its grade is unknown. 5. If there is more than one grade, code the highest grade within the applicable system. Code the highest grade even if it is only a focus. Code grade in the following priority order using the first applicable system: a. special grade systems for the sites listed in Coding for Solid Tumors #6 b. differentiation: use Coding for Solid Tumors #7: 2-, 3-, or 4- grade system c. nuclear grade: use Coding for Solid Tumors #7: 2-, 3-, or 4- grade system d. If it isn't clear whether it is a differentiation or nuclear grade and a 2-, 3-, or 4- grade system was used, code it. e. Terminology (use Coding for Solid Tumors #8) 6. Use the information from the special grade systems first. If no special grade can be coded, continue with Coding for Solid Tumors #7-9. Special grade systems for solid tumors Grade information based on CS Site-specific factors for breast, prostate, heart, mediastinum, peritoneum, retroperitoneum, soft tissue, and kidney parenchyma is used to code grade. See Special Grade System Rules section below for details on how to use this information to code grade.

If no description fits or grade is unknown prior to neoadjuvant therapy, code as a 9 (unknown). SPECIAL GRADE SYSTEMS RULES Breast (site: breast excluding lymphomas; CS schema: breast) Use Bloom Richardson (BR) or Nottingham score/grade to code grade based on CSv2 site-specific factor 7 (SSF) as stated below. If your registry does not collect this SSF, use the description in the table below to determine grade. If you collect this SSF, codes 030-130 could be automatically converted into the grade field. BR could also be referred to as: Bloom-Richardson, modified Bloom-Richardson, of Bloom-Richardson score, of Bloom-Richardson score, Nottingham modification of Scarff-Bloom-Richardson, Nottingham-Tenovus grade, or Nottingham grade. Code the tumor grade using the following priority order a. BR scores 3-9 b. BR grade (low, intermediate, high) BR score may be expressed as a range, 3-9. The score is based on three morphologic features: degree of tubule formation/histologic grade, mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism/nuclear grade of tumor cells. If a report uses words such as low, intermediate, or high rather than numbers, use the table below to code grade. If only a grade of 1 through 4 is given with no information on the score and it is unclear if it is a Nottingham or BR Grade, do not use the table below. Continue with the next priority according to \"Coding for Solid Tumors\" #7 above. Code the highest score if multiple scores are reported (exclude scores from tests after neoadjuvant therapy began). Examples: different scoresmay be reported on multiple pathology reports for the same primary cancer; different scores may be reported for multiple tumors assigned to the same primary cancer.

Do not use for kidney renal pelvis. If your registry does not collect this SSF, use the description in the table to determine grade. If you collect this SSF, the information could be automatically converted into the grade field if it is coded 010-040. Fuhrman nuclear grade is a four-grade system based on nuclear diameter and shape, the prominence of nucleoli, and the presence of chromatin clumping in the highest grade. Description CS Code Grade Code Grade 1 010 1 Grade 2 020 2 Grade 3 030 3 Grade 4 040 4 SoftTissue (sites excluding lymphomas: soft tissue, heart, Sarcomas The Grade for Sarcomas should be used to code grade based on CSv2 SSF 1 as stated below. If your registry does not collect this SSF, use the description in the table to determine grade. If you collect this SSF, the information could be automatically converted into the grade field if it is coded 010-200. The grading system of the French Federation of Cancer Centers Sarcoma Group (FNCLCC) is the preferred system. Record the grade from any three-grade sarcoma grading system the pathologist uses. For terms such as \"well differentiated\" or \"poorly differentiated,\" go to Coding for Solid Tumors #8. In some cases, especially for needle biopsies, grade may be specified only as \"low grade\" or \"high grade.\" The numeric grade takes precedence over \"low grade\" or \"high grade.\"Description CS Code Grade Code Specified as Grade 1 [of 3] 010 2 Specified as Grade 2 [of 3] 020 3 Specified as Grade 3 [of 3] 030 4 Grade stated as low grade, NOS 100 2 Grade stated as high grade, NOS 200 4 Prostate (site: prostate excluding lymphomas; CS schema: prostate) Use the highest Gleason score from the biopsy/TURP or prostatectomy/autopsy. Use a known value over an unknown value. Exclude results from tests performed after neoadjuvant therapy began. This information is collected in CSv2 SSF 8 (Gleason score from biopsy/TURP) and SSF 10 (Gleason score from prostatectomy/autopsy) as stated below. Use the table below to determine grade even if your registry does not collect these SSFs. If you collect these SSFs, the information could be converted into the grade field automatically. Usually prostate cancers are graded using Gleason score or pattern. Gleason grading for prostate primaries is based on a 5-component system (5 histologic patterns). Prostatic cancer generally shows two main histologic patterns. The primary pattern, the pattern occupying greater than 50% of the cancer, is usually indicated by the first number of the Gleason grade, and the secondary pattern is usually indicated by the second number. These two numbers are added together to create a pattern score, ranging from 2 to 10. If there are two numbers, assume that they refer to two patterns (the first number being the primary pattern and the second number the secondary pattern), and sum them to obtain the score. If only one number is given on a particular test and it is less than or equal to 5 and not specified as a score, do not use the information because it could refer to either a score or a grade. If only one number is given and it is greater than 5, assume that it is a score and use it. If the pathology report specifies a specific number out of a total of 10, the first number given is the score. Example: The pathology report says Gleason 3/10. The Gleason score would be 3. Historic Perspective Gleason Score CS Code Grade Code AJCC 7th SEER 2003- 2013 AJCC 6th SEER prior 2003 2 002 1 G1 3 G3 G3 G3 Historical perspective on long term trends in prostate grade: The relationship of Gleason score to grade changed for 1/1/2014+ diagnoses in order to have the grade field in sync with AJCC 7th ed. Analysis of prostate grade before 2014 based solely on the grade field is not recommended. In Collaborative Stage (CS), Gleason score was originally coded in CSv1 in one field (SSF 6) and then it was split into two fields in CSv2 based on the tissue used for the test: needle biopsy/TURP (SSF 8) and prostatectomy/autopsy (SSF 10). For trends using data back to 2004, if one collected the various CS Gleason scores, one could design a recode to have the same criteria as the data collected 2014+. The original grade field would NOT be changed, but for analyses this recode could be based on the CS SSFs and the original grade code.1. 1. For tumor grade for cases before 2014 go to . Appendix N - Pre-2014 Grade Coding Instructions Lymph-vascular Length: 1 This field indicates the presence or absence of tumor cells in lymphatic channels (NOT lymph nodes) or blood vessels within the primary tumor as noted microscopically by the pathologist. It is a mandatory field for cases diagnosed January 1, 2010 onward. Note: This data item is separate from the CS data items but is included in this manual because of its relationship to the Collaborative Stage Data Collection System. Lymph-vascular invasion is an item of interest to both pathologists and clinicians and is mentioned in many chapters of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, seventh edition. Note: This field is required for mapping of T in some sites, such as testis and penis. Instructions for Coding This item may be left blank for cases diagnosed before 2010. The primary source of this information is the College of American Pathologists (CAP) synoptic report or checklist. If it is unavailable, code from the pathology report or a physician's statement, in that order of priority. Use code 1 if lymph-vascular invasion is identified anywhere in a primary tumor specimen. Use code 8 for histologies 9590-9992. Use code 9 if no pathologic examination of primary site tissue was performed. Use code 9 if primary site tissue was examined pathologically, but the report is not available. Use code 9 if the pathology report indicates that the presence of lymph-vascular invasion could not be determined. CodeDescription 0Lymph-vascular invasion is not present (absent) or is not identified 1Lymph-vascular invasion is present or identified 8Not applicable 9Unknown or indeterminate Definition Lymph-vascular invasion is defined as the presence of tumor cells found inside small blood vessels or lymphatic channels within the tumor and surrounding tissues in the primary site. The tumor cells have broken free of the primary tumor and now have the capability to float throughout the body. Other names for lymph-vascular invasion are LVI, lymphovascular invasion, vascular invasion, blood vessel invasion, and lymphatic invasion. Vascular invasion is not the same as direct tumor extension from the primary tumor into adjacent blood vessels; LVI cells are not attached to or growing into the wall of the blood vessel. Lymphatic invasion is not the same as involvement of regional lymph nodes. Lymph-vascular invasion does not include perineural invasion. Instructions for Coding Code from pathology report(s). Code the absence or presence of lymph-vascular invasion as described in the medical record. The primary sources of information about lymph-vascular invasion are the pathology check lists (synoptic reports) developed by1. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 1. 1. 2. 3. 1. 1. 2. 3. the College of American Pathologists. If the case does not have a checklist or synoptic report, code from the pathology report or a physician's statement, in that order. Do not code perineural invasion in this field. Information to code this field can be taken from any specimen from the primary tumor (biopsy or resection.) If lymph-vascular invasion is identified in any specimen, it should be coded as present/identified. For cases with benign or borderline behavior, code the lymph-vascular invasion documented (negative or positive) and, if not documented, code unknown. For cases treated with neoadjuvant therapy, refer to table below in order to code this field. However, if documentation in the medical record indicates information that conflicts with this table, code lymph-vascular invasion with the documentation in the medical record. LVI on pathology report PRIOR to neoadjuvant therapyLVI on pathology report AFTER neoadjuvant therapyCode LVI to: 0 - Not present/Not identified 0 - Not present/Not identified 0 - Not present/Not identified 0 - Not present/Not identified 1 - Present/Identified 1 - Present/Identified 0 - Not present/Not identified 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 1 - Present/Identified 0 - Not present/Not identified 1 - Present/Identified 1 - Present/Identified 1 - Present/Identified 1 - Present/Identified 1 - Present/Identified 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 1 - Present/Identified 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 0 - Not present/Not identified 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 1 - Present/Identified 1 - Present/Identified 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate Use of codes. Use code 0 when the pathology report indicates that there is no lymph-vascular invasion. This includes cases of purely in situ carcinoma, which biologically have no access to lymphatic or vascular channels below the basement9 - Unknown/Indeterminate membrane. Use code 1 when the pathology report or a physician's statement indicates that lymph-vascular invasion (or one of its synonyms) is present in the specimen. Use code 8 for the following primary sites. Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma Leukemias Hematopoietic refractory cytopenias Myeloproliferative disorders Use code 9 when there is no microscopic examination of a primary tissue specimen the primary site specimen is cytology only or a fine needle aspiration the biopsy is only a very small tissue sample1. 4. 5. 6. 7. 2. 1. 2. it is not possible to determine whether lymph-vascular invasion is present the pathologist indicates the specimen is insufficient to determine lymph-vascular invasion lymph-vascular invasion is not mentioned in the pathology report primary site is unknown Clarification between codes 8 and 9: Code 8 should only be used in the following situations: 1. Standard-setter does not require this item and you are not collecting it. 2. Those histologies noted above described in code 8 for which LVI is always not applicable. For those cases where there is no information/documentation from the pathology report or other sources, use code 9 Class of Case Organization Field Name IDRequired KCR Class of Case (CaseClass) 30140yes NAACCR Class of Case 610yes Field Length: 2 Class of case reflects the facility's role in managing this cancer, whether the cancer is required to be reported to ACoS by approved facilities, and whether the case was diagnosed after the program's reference date.

If that information is not available, code class of case '10.' It is possible that information for coding class of case will change during the patient's first course of care. If that occurs, edit the code accordingly. ACoS approved facilities should document for patients coded 00 to establish that the patient went Institution Referred To (item #31660) elsewhere for treatment.

In most instances, it is the patient's physical presence at the facility that denotes \"contact.\" When a pathology specimen is collected off-site and submitted to the facility to be read (and the specimen is positive for cancer), but the patient is never seen at the facility, the case is not required to be abstracted (although a copy of the pathology report must be sent to KCR to be abstracted). Instructions for Coding Record the date the patient first had contact with the facility as either an inpatient or outpatient for the diagnosis and/or treatment of a reportable tumor. The date may be the date of an outpatient visit for a biopsy, X-ray, or laboratory test, or the date a pathology specimen was collected at the hospital.If this is an autopsy or death certificate only case, then use the date of death. When a patient is diagnosed in a staff physician's office, the date of first contact is the date the patient was physically first seen at the reporting facility.

This field refers to the date of first diagnosis of this cancer by a recognized medical practitioner. This is the date of the first clinical diagnosis, and in some cases, the diagnosis may never be histologically confirmed. Do not change the date of diagnosis when a later biopsy or cytology provides confirmation of a clinical diagnosis. From 2009 forward, for cases which are diagnosed in utero, record the actual date of diagnosis. For pre-2009 cases, the date of diagnosis for in utero cases should be the date of birth. Code the date using a zero to precede single digit days, or months, i.e., June is entered as 06. If the exact date is not known, record the best approximation on the basis of available information. As possible guidelines, consider the following: a. For patients diagnosed without positive tissue while in a hospital, the date of admission may be used as the best estimate of the date of diagnosis. b. For patients diagnosed before entering the hospital (i.e., clinic or physician's office), the date of first admission may be used if it seems that the patient was hospitalized within three months or less from the true date of diagnosis by the referring physician. c. If the only information is \"Spring of\", \"Middle of the year\", or \"Fall\", approximate these as April 1st, July 1st, or October 1st, respectively. The date of death is the date of diagnosis for a class of case 38.

Use code 0 (not a paired organ) for an unknown primary site (C80.9). 2. Code laterality using codes 1-9 for all of the sites listed below. Note: Laterality may be coded for sites other than those listed below. 3. Code the side where the primary tumor originated. a. Assign code 3 if the laterality is not known but the tumor is confined to a single side of the paired organ. Example: Pathology report: Patient has a 2cm carcinoma in the upper pole of the kidney. Code laterality as 3 because there is documentation that the disease exists in only one kidney, but it is unknown if the disease originated in the right or left kidney. 4. Code 4 is seldom used EXCEPT for the following diseases: i. Both ovaries involved simultaneously, single histology ii. Bilateral retinoblastomas iii. Bilateral Wilms' tumor iv. If both lungs have nodules or tumors and the lung of origin is not known 5. Assign code 5 when the tumor originates in the midline of a site listed in has an excision of a melanoma located just above the umbilicus. Example 2:Patient has a midline meningioma of the cerebral meninges. 6. Assign code 9 when: a. The neoplasm originated in a paired site and 1. Laterality is unknown AND 2. There is no statement that only one side of the paired organ is involved. Example 1: Admitting history says patient was diagnosed with lung cancer based on positive sputum cytology.

It counts the occurrence of independent, malignant primaries that are required to be reported to the ACoS for approved cancer programs. The sequence number 00 indicates that this patient has one primary cancer. The sequence 01 indicates that the case is the first of multiple primaries. Sequence numbers in the range of 60-88 have a special meaning to ACoS. They are reserved for conditions that are collected by the registry but are not required by ACoS. These include diagnoses required by KCR but not ACoS (such as VIN III, VAIN III, and AIN III, as well as invasive recurrences abstracted after an in-situ cancer.) Pre-invasive carcinomas of the cervix that were diagnosed in 1996 and 1997 will be sequenced in this range also, because they were required by KCR at the time, but not ACoS. As of January 1, 2004, benign and borderline intracranial tumors became reportable to ACoS as well as KCR. These are sequenced in the 60-88 series.

Always code the procedure with the lower numeric value when presence of cancer is confirmed with multiple diagnostic methods. This item is an indicator of the precision of diagnosis. The percentage of solid tumors that are clinically diagnosed is only an indication of whether casefinding includes sources beyond pathology reports. Complete casefinding must include both clinically and pathologically confirmed cases. Record the best mode of diagnostic confirmation recorded at any time in the patient's history of this cancer. CodeLabel Definition 1Positive histology Histologic confirmation (tissue microscopically examined). Microscopic diagnosis based on tissue specimens from biopsy, frozen section, surgery, autopsy, D&C, or from aspiration or biopsy of bone marrow specimens. 2Positive cytology Cytologic confirmation (fluid cells microscopically examined). Microscopic diagnosis based on examination of cells such as sputum smears, bronchial brushings or washings, prostatic spinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, urinary sediment, cervical or vaginal smears, or from paraffin block specimens from concentrated spinal, pleural, or peritoneal fluid. 4Positive microscopic confirmation, method not specifiedMicroscopic confirmation is all that is known. It is unknown if tissue or cells were examined. 5Positive laboratory test/marker studyA clinical diagnosis of cancer based on laboratory tests/marker studies which are clinically diagnostic for cancer. Examples include AFP for liver cancer and abnormal electrophoretic spike for mulitple myeloma. Note: elevated PSA is only diagnostic of cancer if the physician uses the PSA as a basis for diagnosing prostate cancer with no further workup. 6Direct visualization without microscopic confirmationThe tumor was visualized during a surgical or endoscopic procedure with no tissue resected for microscopic examination. Use this code when the diagnosis is based only on the surgeon's operative report from a surgical exploration or endoscopy, or from gross autopsy findings in the absence of tissue or cytological findings. 7Radiography and other imaging techniques without microscopic confirmationThe malignancy was reported by the physician from an imaging technique report only. 8Clinical diagnosis onlyThe malignancy was reported by the physician in the medical record. If a physician treats a patient for cancer, in spite of a negative biopsy, this is a reportable clinical diagnosis. Also, if a physician continues to describe a patient as having a reportable tumor, even after reviewing negative pathology results, this too is a reportable clinical diagnosis. 9Unknown whether or not microscopically confirmedA statement of malignancy was reported in the medical record, but there is no statement of how the cancer was diagnosed. Instructions for coding hematopoietic or lymphoid tumors (9590-9992) There is no priority hierarchy for coding diagnostic confirmation for hematopoietic and lymphoid tumors. Code this field according the definitive diagnostic method used to confirm this malignancy. Definitive diagnostic methods are displayed in the hematopoietic database for each reportable hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasm. Use code 3 whenever it applies-- i.e., whenever a positive histologic diagnosis is supported by a further positive test, such as IHC or genetic testing CodeLabel Definition 1Positive histology Histologic confirmation (tissue microscopically examined). Microscopic diagnosis based on tissue specimens from biopsy, frozen section, surgery, autopsy, or bone marrow aspiration or biopsy. For leukemia only, code 1 when the diagnosis is based only on the complete blood count (CBC), white blood count (WBC), or peripheral blood (PB) smear. 2Positive cytology Cytologic confirmation (fluid cells microscopically examined). Microscopic diagnosis based on examination of cells such as spinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, urinary sediment, cervical or vaginal smears, or from paraffin block specimens from concentrated spinal, pleural, or peritoneal fluid. These methods are rarely used for hematopoietic or lymphoid tumors. 3Positive histology PLUS positive immunophenotyping and/or positive genetic studiesHistology is positive for cancer, and there are also positive immunophenotyping and/or genetic test results. For example, bone marrow examination is positive for AML (9861/3). Genetic testing shows AML with inv(16)p13.1q22) (9871/3). Do not use this code for neoplasms diagnosed prior to January 1, 2010. 4Positive microscopic confirmation, method not specifiedMicroscopic confirmation is all that is known. It is unknown if tissue or cells were examined. 5Positive laboratory test/marker studyA clinical diagnosis of cancer is based on laboratory tests/marker studies which are clinically diagnostic for cancer. 6Direct visualization without microscopic confirmationThe tumor was visualized during a surgical or endoscopic procedure only with no tissue resected for microscopic examination. Use this code when the diagnosis is based only on the surgeon's operative report from a surgical exploration or endoscopy, or from gross autopsy findings in the absence of tissue or cytological findings. 7Radiography and other imaging techniques without microscopic examinationThe malignancy was reported by the physician from an imaging technique report only.8Clinical diagnosis only The malignancy was reported by the physician in the medical record. A number of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms are diagnosed by tests of exclusion where the tests for the disease are equivocal and the physician makes a clinical diagnosis based on the information from the equivocal tests and the patient's clinical presentation. 9Unknown whether or not microscopically confirmedA statement of malignancy was reported in the medical record, but there is no statement of how the cancer was diagnosed.

It is not to be used for cases diagnosed prior to that date. Its introduction does not affect CoC requirements for physicians to assign AJCC staging or the requirement that the physician-assigned staging values be recorded in the registry. CS Version 2 was implemented in 2010, and all cases previously entered under CS Version 1 were converted to CSv2. Collaborative Staging was designed for registrar use. For Collaborative Staging, registrars code discrete pieces of information once and the CS computer algorithm derives the values for AJCC T, N, M and Stage Group, Summary Stage 1977, and Summary Stage 2000. The derived stage codes are ideally suited for data analysis because of the consistency that can be obtained with objectively-recorded, identically-processed data items. The timing rule for CS coding was designed to make use of the most complete information possible to yield the \"best stage\" information for the tumor at the time of diagnosis-- \"use all information gathered through completion of surgery(ies) in first course of treatment or all information available within four months of the date of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer.\" Disease progression is defined as further direct extension or distant metastasis known to have developed after the diagnosis was established. Information about tumor extension, lymph node involvement, or distant metastasis obtained after disease progression is documented should be excluded from the CS coding. The following CS data items are coded by the registrar. 30540. CS Tumor Size 30550. CS Extension30560. CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval 30570. CS Lymph Nodes 30580. CS Reg Lymph Nodes Eval 30590.

Derived SS1977 30710. Derived SS2000 Unlike the AJCC and Summary Stage codes that are derived from it, CS is more of a site-specific data collection system. The CS algorithm uses tumor site and histology to determine which CS schema to apply. Depending on the schema, the coding instructions and code definitions will vary. Collaborative Staging codes are defined for every site and histology combination. The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual does not cover all sites, and some histologies are excluded from sites with an AJCC coding scheme. When the CS algorithm processes a site-histology combination that does not have an applicable AJCC code, it assigns the display string \"NA\" for \"Not applicable.\" A blank display string for a derived item means the CS algorithm was not run for the case.Coding CS Items The complete instructions and site-histology defined codes are available in the Collaborative Stage Data Collection System Coding Instructions (CS Manual). Effective 01/01/2014, CS version 02.05 was implemented. Part I, Section 1 provides general instructions and the instructions and codes for generic (non site-specific) items. Part I, Section 2 contains lab tests, tumor markers, and site specific factor notes. Part II contains the site-specific schemas and codes. The CS Manual and related information is available electronically on the AJCC Web site: http://cancerstaging.o . For an easily navigable web-based schema and coding instructions, go to rg/cstage/Pages/default.aspx http://cancerstaging.o Use the downloadable manual as well as the website to view the notes and appropriate codes for rg/cstage/schema/Pages/version0205.aspx each schema. Begin assigning codes for the Collaborative Staging data items. Be sure to read the notes and follow the site/histology-specific instructions at the beginning of each item. Some schemas require additional staging or prognostic information for that particular site. CS Site-Specific Factors 1-25 are designed to collect that information. Code the tumor size in the CS Tumor Size item. Code how far the tumor has spread directly in the CS Extension item. Code how the farthest tumor spread was determined in the CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval item. Code whether regional lymph nodes are involved in the CS Lymph Nodes item. Code how the farthest lymph node spread was determined in the CS Reg Node Eval item. Code the number of positive regional lymph nodes from the pathology report in the Regional Nodes Positive item. Code the number of regional lymph nodes examined by the pathologist in the Regional Nodes Examined item. Code the farthest distant metastasis (including distant lymph nodes) in the CS Mets at Dx item. Code how the distant metastasis was determined in the CS Mets Eval item. Code the presence or absence of bone, brain, liver, or lung metastases. Code all required CS Site-Specific Factors. The derived stage information for AJCC 6th edition staging will be calculated when the case is saved, or prior to exiting the case. The derived stage information for AJCC 7th edition will only be calculated for cases diagnosed January 1, 2010, forward. When the computer derives the final stage information, the program will check the histology code and other coded information to determine whether T, N, M and Stage Group will be generated for the case.

In addition, accurate staging is necessary to evaluate the results of treatments and clinical trials, to facilitate the exchange and comparison of information among treatment centers, and to serve as a basis for clinical and translational cancer research. At a national and international level, the agreement on classifications of cancer cases provides a method of clearly conveying clinical experience to others without ambiguity. The most clinically useful staging system is the tumor-node-metastatis (TNM) system maintained collaboratively by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union for Cancer Control (UICC). The TNM system classifies cancers by the size and extent of the primary tumor (T), involvement of regional lymph nodes (N), and the presence or absence of distant metastases (M), supplemented in recent years by carefully selected nonanatomic prognostic factors. NOTE: The AJCC Manual for Staging Cancer, Third Edition is used with cases diagnosed from 1989-1992. The AJCC Manual for Staging Cancer, Fourth Edition, is used with cases diagnosed from 1993 to 1997. The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, Fifth Edition, is used with cases diagnosed from 1998 to 2002. The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, Sixth Edition, is used with cases diagnosed from 2003 to 2009.1. 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 1. 9. 10. 11. 12. The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, Seventh Edition, is used with cases diagnosed 2010 forward. NOTE: For 2008 diagnoses forward, ACoS requires clinical TNM staging assigned by a physician if available. If not available, these fields must be completed by the registrar. Pathologic TNM is not required. For pre-2008 diagnoses, physician-assigned TNM stage is required for both clinical and pathologic staging in approved programs. Physicians may choose to record both the clinical and the pathologic stage if applicable. Registrars are required to report both if information is available from the physician. KCR requires only one TNM stage-- pathologic if the information is available, otherwise clinical. The TNM general rules applicable to all sites contained in the Seventh Edition are as follows: All cases should be confirmed microscopically for classification by TNM. Cases that do not have any biopsy or cytology of the tumor can be staged, but survival should be analyzed separately. These cases should not be included in overall disease survival analyses. Eligible time period for determination of staging: Clinical staging, designated cTNM, includes any information obtained about the extent of cancer before initiation of definitive treatment (surgery, systemic or radiation therapy, active surveillance, or palliative care) or within four months after the date of diagnosis, whichever is shorter, as long as the cancer has not clearly progressed during that time frame. Pathologic staging, designated pTNM, includes any information obtained about the extent of cancer up through completion of definitive surgery as part of first course treatment or identified within four months after the date of diagnosis, whichever is longer, as long as there is no systemic or radiation therapy initiated or the cancer has not clearly progressed during that time frame. Cases with neoadjuvant, or primary systemic or radiation therapy may have a second stage defined from information obtained after therapy that is recorded using a yc or yp prefix (ycTNM or ypTNM; y must always be modified as yc or yp). However, these patients should also have clinical stage recorded as this is the stage used for comparative purposes. Clinical stage includes only information collected prior to the start of treatment. In cases where there is documented progression of cancer prior to the initiation of therapy or surgery, only information obtained prior to documented progression is used for staging. If there is uncertainty in assigning a T, N, or M classification, a stage modifying factor (i.e., in clinical situations where it is unclear if the lymph nodes are N2 or N1), or anatomic stage/prognostic group, default to the lower (lesser) of the two categories in the uncertain range. If a nonanatomic factor required for grouping is not available, the case is assigned to the group assuming that factor was the lowest or least advanced (e.g., lower Gleason's score in prostate cancer). In the case of multiple, simultaneous tumors in one organ, the tumor with the highest T category should be identified and the multiplicity will be recorded in the TNM descriptor field. In simultaneous bilateral cancers of paired organs, each tumor should be classified independently if each is determined to be a separate primary. In tumors of the thyroid, liver, and ovary, as well as in nephroblastomas and neuroblastomas, multiplicity is a criterion of T classification. In the case of a primary of unknown origin, staging will be based on reasonable clinical certainty of the primary organ. If reasonable clinical certainty is not obvious, the case cannot be staged. For example, if a patient has brain metastases diagnosed by a computed tomographic (CT) imaging scan, and the physician records that the primary is probably lung, code the primary site to lung and use the lung classification system for staging. However, if a patient is noted to have metastatic disease to the liver, and the pathology report cites that the primary may be lung or colon, this case cannot be staged, unless the origin of the primary is documented elsewhere. For in-situ classification, if there is an acceptable histologic classification of in-situ carcinoma as determined by your pathologist, but it has not been specified in the AJCC chapter, it can be used to classify pTis. The correct classification for in-situ lesions is pTis cN0 cM0, and should be reported as both clinical stage group 0 and pathologic stage group 0. If pathologic assessment of lymph nodes reveals negative nodes but the number of examined lymph nodes is less than the suggested number for lymph node dissection, classify the N category as pN0. Only one lymph node is required to be removed for pathologic staging. Isolated tumor cells (ITC's) are single tumor cells or small clusters of cells not more than 0.2 mm in greatest dimension that are usually detected by immunohistochemistry or molecular methods. Cases with ITC's in lymph nodes or at distant sites should be classified as N0 or M0, respectively. The same applies to cases with findings suggestive of tumor cells or their components by non morphologic techniques such as flow cytometry or DNA analysis. These cases should be analyzed separately and have special recording rules in the specific organ site. Except where pM is positive, cM should be used along with pT and pN for calculating pathologic stage; \"pM0\" is not a valid concept. \"MX\" is not a valid category from 2010 forward. Infer status as cM0 unless known M1. When physician and registrar disagree on correct TNM stage: In situations in which the registrar disagrees with the TNM stage assigned by the physician, the registrar should attempt to resolve the discrepancy with the appropriate physician. It is also recommended that hospitals with ACoS approved cancer programs have these discrepancies reviewed by the Cancer Committee liaison to the registry if further resolution is needed. The physician's TNM classification and stage group should be recorded in the cancer registry database and the \"staged by\" field should indicate physician. Any discussion or disagreement by the registrar and/or registry physician advisors should be recorded in text.

Example: Chest x-ray shows 3.5 cm mass; the pathology report from the surgery states that the same mass is malignant and measures 2.8 cm. Record tumor size as 028 (28 mm).1. 2. 3. 4. Example: Pathology report states lung carcinoma is 2.1 cm x 3.2 cm x 1.4 cm. Record tumor size as 032 (32 mm). If neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery, do not record the size of the pathologic specimen. Code the largest size of tumor prior to neoadjuvant treatment; if unknown code size as 999. Example: Patient has a 2.2 cm mass in the oropharynx; find needle aspiration of mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma. Patient receives a course of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy. Pathologic size after total resection is 2.8 cm. Record tumor size as 022 (22mm). If no surgical resection, then largest measurement of the tumor from physical exam, imaging, or other diagnostic procedures prior to any other form of treatment. If 1, 2, and 3 do not apply, the largest size from all information available within four months of the date of diagnosis, in the absence of disease progression.

These are considered the same as secondary diagnoses. Instructions for Coding Depending on whether the hospital has implemented use of ICD-10-CM, this information may be identified either in ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM form. Do not record ICD-10-CM codes in the comorbidity fields ; use the secondary diagnoses fields to record ICD-10-CM codes. Some ICD-10-CM codes are more than 5 characters long. Only enter the first five characters. Omit the decimal point between the third and fourth characters. If there are fewer than five characters, use zeros after the code to fill the spaces. Secondary diagnoses and complications must be reported for patients that have inpatient hospitalizations at your facility. Secondary diagnoses and complications should be reported for patients receiving outpatient care or treated in oncology clinics at your facility when available. Consult the patient record for the discharge abstract. Secondary diagnoses are found under secondary diagnoses on the discharge abstract. Information from the billing department at your facility may be consulted when a discharge abstract is not available. Code the secondary diagnoses in the sequence in which they appear on the discharge abstract or billing list.. Report the secondary diagnoses for this cancer using the following priority rules: - Surgically treated patients: a) following the most definitive surgery of the primary site b) following other non-primary site surgeries - Non-surgically treated patients: following the first treatment encounter/episode - In cases of non-treatment: following the last diagnostic/evaluative encounter If the data item is coded 1, 2, or 3, then use available Readmission To The Same Hospital Within 30 Days of Surgical Discharge Comorbidities and Complications data items to record codes appearing on the \"readmission\" discharge abstracts that are coded using ICD-9-CM.

Enter a '1' in the field that describes the edit check that is to be overridden. Override flags a-d (fields 32270-32300) are not used by KCR. Override flags e-v are described in greater detail on the following pages. Acsn/Class/Seq Override Organization Field Seq Number (CoC), checks the following: If the case is the only case or the first of multiple cases diagnosed at the facility (ACoS Sequence Number = 00, 01, 60 or 61, and Class of Case = 0, 1, or 6), then the first 4 characters of the Accession Number must equal the year of the Date of First Contact. If the case is first diagnosed at autopsy (Class of Case = 5), and the case is the only case or the first of multiple cases for a patient (ACoS Sequence Number = 00, 01, 60, or 61), then the first 4 characters of the Accession Number must equal the year of the Date of Last Contact or Death AND must equal the year of the Date of First Contact. If the case is first diagnosed at autopsy (Class of Case = 5), and the case is the second or more case for a patient (ACoS Sequence Number greater than 01 or greater than 61), then the year of the Date of First Contact must equal the year of Date of Last Contact or Death. There are some exceptions to the above rules. Override Acsn/Class/Seq may be used to override the edit when the circumstances fit the following situation or one similar to it: The case may be the only or the first of multiple malignant cases for a patient (ACoS Sequence Number = 00 or 01), but there is an earlier benign case (with an earlier year of the Date of First Contact) for which the Accession Number applies.

This edit forces review of multiple primary cancers when one of the primaries is coded to a site other than ill-defined or unknown and is not microscopically confirmed or confirmed by a positive lab test/marker study. If this edit is failed and the suspect case is confirmed accurate as coded, and the number of primaries is correct, set the Override HospSeq/DxConf to 1. Do not set the override flag on the patient's other primary cancers. However, if it turns out that the non-microscopically-confirmed cancer is considered a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers, delete the non-microscopically-confirmed case. Check the sequence numbers of remaining cases, correcting them if necessary. Also check for other data items on the remaining cases that may need to be changed as a result of the corrections, such as stage and treatment. Instructions for Coding Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for the edit Diagnostic Confirm, Seq Num-Hosp (CoC). Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1 if a review of all items in the error or warning message confirms that all are correct COC-Site/Type Override Organization Field are multiple versions of edits of the type, Primary Site, Morphology-Type, which check for \"usual\" combinations of site and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 histology. The SEER version of the edit is more restrictive than the CoC edit, and thus uses a different override flag. The CoC version of the edit will accept Override CoC-Site/Type or Override Site/Type as equivalent. The Site/Histology Validation List (available on the SEER Web site) contains those histologies commonly found in the specified primary site. Histologies that occur only rarely or never are not be included. These edits require review of all combinations not listed. Since basal and squamous cell carcinomas of non-genital skin sites are not reportable to SEER, these site/histology combinations do not appear on the SEER validation list. For the CoC version of the edit, if Primary Site is in the range C44.0-C44.9 (skin), and the ICD-O-3 histology is in the (basal cell carcinomas), no further editing is done. No override is necessary for these cases in the CoC version of the edit. Review of these cases requires investigating whether the combination is biologically implausible or there are cancer registry coding conventions that would dictate different codes for the diagnosis. Review of these rare combinations often results in changes to the primary site and/or morphology, rather than a decision that the combination is correct. Instructions for Coding Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for edits of the type Primary Site, Morphology-Type Check. Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1 if a review of all items in the error or warning message confirms they are correct and coded in conformance with coding rules. HospSeq/Site type, Num--Hosp, Primary Site, Morph, differ in use of ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 morphology. They force review of multiple primary cancers when one of the primaries is coded to a site-morphology combination that could indicate a metastatic site rather than a primary site. If ACoS Sequence Number indicates the person has had more than one primary, then any case with one of the following site-histology combinations requires review: C76.0-C76.8 (Ill-defined sites) or and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 histology < 9590. (Look for evidence that the unknown or ill-defined primary is a secondary site from one of the patient's other cancers. For example, a clinical discharge diagnosis of \"abdominal carcinomatosis\" may be attributable to the patient's primary ovarian cystadenocarcinoma already in the registry, and should not be entered as a second primary.) C77.0-C77.9 (lymph nodes) and ICD-O-2 histology not in range 9590-9717 or ICD-O-3 histology the range 9590-9729; or histology not in range 9590-9941 or ICD-O-3 histology not in the range 9590-9989. (That combination is most likely a metastatic lesion. Check whether the lesion could be a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers.) Any site and ICD-O-2 histology in the range 9720-9723, 9740-9741 or ICD-O-3 histology in the range 9740-9758. (Verify that these diagnoses are coded correctly and are indeed separate primaries from the others.) If it turns out that the suspect tumor is a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers, delete the metastatic or secondary case, re-sequence remaining cases, and correct the coding on the original case as necessary. Instructions for Coding Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for an edit of the type Seq Num--Hosp, Primary Site, Morph Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1 if review of all items in the error or warning message confirms that all are correct. Site/TNM-StgGrp Override Organization Field Site, AJCC Stage Group - Edition 6 (COC), checks that the pathologic and clinical AJCC stage group codes are valid for the site and histology group according to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, Sixth Edition, using the codes described for the items Clinical Stage Group and Pathologic Stage Group. Combinations of site and histology not represented in any AJCC schema must be coded 88. Unknown codes must be coded 99. Blanks are not permitted. Since pediatric cancers whose sites and histologies have an AJCC scheme may be coded according to a pediatric scheme instead, Override Site/TNM-Stage Group is used to indicate pediatric cases not coded according to the AJCC manual. Pediatric stage groups should not be recorded in the Clinical Stage Group or Pathologic Stage Group items. When neither clinical nor pathologic AJCC staging is used for pediatric cases, code all AJCC items 88. When any components of either is used to stage a pediatric case, follow the instructions for coding AJCC items and leave Override Site/TNM-Stage Group blank. Instructions for Coding Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for the edit, Primary Site, AJCC Stage Group - Edition 6 (COC). Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1 if the case is confirmed to be a pediatric case that was coded using a pediatric coding system.

Instructions for Coding Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message (and if the case was not diagnosed in utero) for the edit Age, Primary Site, Morphology (CoC) and/or the edit Age, Primary Site, Morphology ICD-O-3 (CoC). Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1, 2, or 3 as indicated if review of all items in the error or warning message confirms that all are correct.

It is important to verify that the non-microscopically-confirmed case is indeed a separate primary from any others that may have been reported. If the suspect case is accurate as coded, and the number of primaries is correct, set the Override SeqNo/DxConf flag to 1 so that the case will not appear in future edits as an error. It is not necessary to set the override flag on the patient's other primary cancers. If it turns out that the non-microscopically-confirmed cancer is considered a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers, delete the non-microscopically-confirmed case.

Surg/DxConf Override (IF46) Organization Prim Site, Diag Conf, check that cases with a primary site surgical procedure coded 20-90 are histologically confirmed. If the patient had a surgical procedure, most likely there was a microscopic examination of the cancer. Verify the surgery and diagnostic confirmation codes, and correct any errors. Sometimes there are valid reasons why no microscopic confirmation is achieved with the surgery, for example, the tissue removed may be inadequate for evaluation. Instructions for Coding Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for edits of the type, RX Summ-Surg Prim Site, Diag Conf. Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1 if review of all items in the error or warning message confirms that all are correct. Site/Type Override (IF25) Organization are multiple versions of edits of the type, Primary Site, Morphology-Type, which check for \"usual\" combinations of site and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 histology. The SEER version of the edit is more restrictive than the CoC edit, and thus uses a different override flag. The CoC version of the edit will accept Override CoC-Site/Type or Override Site/Type as equivalent. The Site/Histology Validation List (available on the SEER website) contains those histologies commonly found in the specified primary site. Histologies that occur only rarely or never are not be included. These edits require review of all combinations not listed. Since basal and squamous cell carcinomas of non-genital skin sites are not reportable to SEER, these site/histology combinations do not appear on the SEER validation list. For the CoC version of the edit, if Primary Site is in the range C440-C449 (skin), and the ICD-O-3 histology is in the (basal cell carcinomas), no further editing is done. No override is necessary for these cases in the CoC version of the edit. Review of these cases requires investigating whether the combination is biologically implausible or there are cancer registry coding conventions that would dictate different codes for the diagnosis. Review of these rare combinations often results in changes to the primary site and/or morphology, rather than a decision that the combination is correct. Instructions for Coding Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for the edit Primary Site, Morphology-Type Check (SEER IF25) and/or the edit Primary Site, Morphology-Type ICDO3 (SEER IF25). Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1 if review of all items in the error or warning message confirms that all are correct. Histology Override (MORPH) Organization Field Name I. Edits of the type, Diagnostic Confirmation, Behavior Code, differ in the use of ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 and check that, for in situ cases (Behavior = 2), Diagnostic Confirmation specifies microscopic confirmation (1, 2 or 4). The distinction between in situ and invasive is very important to a registry, since prognosis is so different. Since the determination that a neoplasm has not invaded surrounding tissue, i.e. is in situ, is made microscopically, cases coded in situ in behavior should have a microscopic confirmation code. Note: Very rarely, a physician will designate a case noninvasive or in situ without microscopic evidence. If an edit of the type, Diagnostic Confirmation, Behavior Code, gives an error message or warning, check that Behavior Code and Diagnostic Confirmation have been coded correctly. Check carefully for any cytologic or histologic evidence that may have been missed in coding. II. Edits of the type, Morphology-Type/Behavior, perform the following overrideable check: Codes listed in ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 with behavior codes of only 0 or 1 are considered valid, since use of the behavior matrix of ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3 allows for the elevation of the behavior of such histologies when the tumor is in situ or malignant. This edit forces review of these rare cases to verify that they are indeed in situ or malignant. If a Morphology-Type/Behavior edit produces an error or warning message and the case is one in which the 4-digit morphology code is one that appears in ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 only with behavior codes of 0 or 1, verify the coding of morphology and that the behavior should be coded malignant or in situ. The registrar may need to consult a pathologist or medical advisor in problem cases. Exceptions to the above: If year of Date of Diagnosis > 2000, then a behavior code of 1 is valid for the following ICDO-2 histologies and no a behavior code of 8451, 8462, 8472, and 8473. Note: The Morphology-Type/Behavior edits are complex and perform several additional types of checks. No other aspects of their checks are subject to override.

Ill-Define Site Override (IF22) Organization Field 2060no This edit forces review of multiple primary cancers when one of the primaries is coded to a site-morphology combination that could indicate a metastatic site rather than a primary site. GENERAL It is important to verify that the suspect case is indeed a separate primary from any others that may have been reported for the patient. Correction of errors may require inspection of the abstracted text, either online or as recorded on a paper abstract. Review of the original medical record may be necessary. If the suspect case is accurate as coded, and the number of primaries is correct, set the Over-ride Ill-define site flag to 1 so that the case will not be considered in error when the edit is run again. It is not necessary to set the over-ride flag on the patient's other primary cancers. If it turns out that the suspect cancer is considered a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers, delete the former case, resequence remaining cases, and correct the coding on the latter case as necessary. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES1. Ill-defined sites (C76.0 - C76.8) or unknown primary (C80.9) and histology code less than 9590: Look for evidence that the unknown or ill-defined primary is a secondary site (extension or metastasis) from one of the patient's other cancers. For example, a clinical discharge diagnosis of \"r;abdominal carcinomatosis\" may be attributable to the patient's primary ovarian cystadenocarcinoma known to the registry, and should not be entered as a second primary. 2. Lymph nodes (C77.0 - C77.9) and histology code not in the range 9590-9714: Primary malignancies of lymph nodes are almost exclusively the lymphomas coded in the range 9590-9714. A carcinoma, sarcoma, leukemia, or other diagnosis outside that range in a lymph node is most likely a metastatic (secondary) lesion. Check whether the lymph node lesion could be a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers. If the lesion in the lymph node is considered a separate primary, try to ascertain a more appropriate primary site than lymph nodes. 3. Hematopoietic and reticuloendothelial systems (C42.0 - C42.4) and histology not in the range 9590-9941: Primary cancers of the blood, bone marrow, spleen, etc. are almost exclusively lymphomas, leukemias, and related conditions coded in the range 9590-9941. A carcinoma, sarcoma, or other diagnosis outside that range in one of these sites is most likely a metastatic (secondary) lesion. Check whether the lesions could be a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers. If the lesion is considered a separate primary, try to ascertain a more appropriate primary site other than those in the C42 group. 4. Other lymphoreticular neoplasms and mast cell tumors of any site (histologies 9720-9723 and 9740-9741): Verify that these diagnoses are coded correctly and are indeed separate primaries from the other reported ones. Instructions for Coding Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for this edit. Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1 if review of all items in the error or warning message confirms that all are correct. Leuk, Lymphoma Override (IF48) Diagnostic Confirmation, Histol Type, differ in use of ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 and check the following: Since lymphoma and leukemia are almost exclusively microscopic diagnoses, this edit forces review of any cases of lymphoma that have diagnostic confirmation of direct visualization or clinical, and any leukemia with a diagnostic confirmation of direct visualization. If histology is 9590-9717 for ICD-O-2 or 9590-9729 for ICD-O-3 (lymphoma), then Diagnostic Confirmation cannot be 6 (direct visualization) or 8 (clinical). If histology is 9720-9941 for ICD-O-2 or 9731-9948 for ICD-O-3 (leukemia and other), then Diagnostic Confirmation cannot be 6 (direct visualization). In an edit of the type, Diagnostic Confirmation, Histol Type, produces an error or warning message, check that the Histology and Diagnostic Confirmation are correctly coded. Remember that positive hematologic findings and bone marrow specimens are included as histologic confirmation (code 1 in Diagnostic Confirmation) for leukemia. Instructions for Coding Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for the edits of the type Diagnostic Confirmation, Histol Type. Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1 if review of all items in the error or warning message confirms that all are correct. Site/Behavior Override (IF39) Organization of the type, Primary Site, Behavior Code, require review of the following primary sites with a behavior of in situ (ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 behavior = 2): Code Description C26.9 Gastrointestinal tract, NOS C39.9 Ill-defined sites within respiratory system C55.9 Uterus, NOS C57.9 Female genital tract, NOS C63.9 Male genital organs, NOS C68.9 Urinary system, NOS NOS C76.0-C76.8 Ill-defined sites C80.9 Unknown primary site Since the designation of in situ is very specific and almost always requires microscopic confirmation, ordinarily specific information should also be available regarding the primary site. Conversely, if inadequate information is available to determine a specific primary site, it is unlikely that information about a cancer being in situ is reliable. If a specific in situ diagnosis is provided, try to obtain a more specific primary site. A primary site within an organ system can sometimes be identified based on the diagnostic procedure or treatment given or on the histologic type. If a more specific site cannot be determined, it is usually preferable to code a behavior code of 3. In the exceedingly rare situation in which it is certain that the behavior is in situ and no more specific-site code is applicable, set Override Site/Behavior to 1. Instructions for Coding Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for the edit Primary Site, Behavior Code (CoC) and/or the edit Primary Site, Behavior Code ICD-O-3 (CoC). Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1 if review of all items in the error or warning message confirms that all are correct.

Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1 if review of all items in the error or warning message confirms that all are correct. Site/Lat/Morph Override (IF42) Organization the type, Laterality, Primary Site, Morph, differ in whether they produce a warning or an error message and in use of ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 morphology. This edit checks the following: If the Primary Site is a paired organ and Behavior Code is in situ (2), then Laterality must be 1, 2, or 3. If diagnosis year is less than 1988 and Histology is greater than or equal to 9590, then no further editing is performed. If diagnosis year is greater than 1987 and Histology equals 9140, 9700, 9701, 9590-9980, then no further editing is performed. The intent of this edit is to force a review of in situ cases for which Laterality is coded 4 (bilateral) or 9 (unknown laterality) as to origin. In rare instances when the tumor is truly midline (9) or the rare combination is otherwise confirmed correct, enter code 1 for Override Site/Lat/Morph.

Use code 0 when a case is accessioned based on conclusive terminology. The diagnosis includes clear and definite terminology describing the malignancy within 60 days of the original diagnosis. Note: Usually the patient undergoes a diagnostic work-up because there is a suspicion of cancer (ambiguous terminology). For example, a mammogram may show calcifications suspicious for intraductal carcinoma; the date of the mammogram is the date of initial diagnosis. When there is a clear and definite diagnosis within 60 days of that mammogram (date of initial diagnosis), such as the pathology from an excisional biopsy showing intraductal carcinoma, assign code 0. 2. Use code 1 when a case is accessioned based on ambiguous terminology and there is no clear and definite terminology used to describe the malignancy within 60 days of the date of initial diagnosis. The diagnosis may be from a pathology report, a radiology report, an imaging report, or in the medical record. 3. Use code 2 when a case is accessioned based on ambiguous terminology followed by clear and definite more than 60 days after the initial diagnosis. 4. Follow back to a physician or subsequent readmission (following the initial 60 day period) may eventually confirm cancer (conclusive cancer term more than 60 days after ambiguous term).

Collaborative Stage item #30540 Code the farthest documented extension of tumor away from the primary site, either by contiguous extension or distant metastasis. The description of the primary tumor growth within the organ of origin or its extension to neighboring organs, or its metastasis to distant sites is summarized in a two-digit code. It is a hierarchical code in which the most extensive disease is all that is coded. Thus, information about the extent of the tumor within the primary site is lost if the tumor extends to neighboring organs, and extension to neighboring organs is lost if there is distant metastasis. Code '99' is reserved for unknown extension, except for prostate.

If the diagnosis date is before 1-1-2004, record the size of the tumor here in millimeters as stated in the pathology report. If more than one dimension is recorded, code the greatest one. For example, 6.1 x 9.4 cm should be recorded as 094. To convert centimeters to millimeters, multiply centimeters by 10. If the tumor size is stated in millimeters, such as \"breast tumor is 13 mm,\" code as 013.Use the instructions in the SEER Extent of Disease 1998 Codes and Coding Instructions manual, pages 3-5 and the tables that follow, to code this field. If the pathology report does not specify tumor size, a reasonable estimate should be entered from the surgical notes, from scans or radiologic reports, or other clinical findings in that order. If unknown, code '999'. Use the charts and tables on the following pages for additional guidelines in coding this field. EXCEPTIONS: For melanomas of the skin, vulva, penis, scrotum, and conjunctiva, use this field to record the DEPTH OF INVASION (thickness of tumor) - and not largest tumor dimension - in HUNDREDTHS OF MILLIMETERS. For example, a melanoma with 1.55 mm depth of invasion should be coded 155. A melanoma of 9.9 mm or greater should be coded 990. For melanomas of the uvea and other parts of the eye (C69.1-C69.4, C69.8-C69.9), as well as any other anatomic sites, record the tumor size at largest dimension and not depth of invasion. For mycosis fungoides and Sezary's disease, use this field to record PERIPHERAL BLOOD INVOLVEMENT instead of tumor size. For Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma, use this field to record HIV STATUS instead of tumor size. You may round off if the size is more precise than the coding spaces available. For example: -ovarian tumor is 16.75 cm - code 168 -skin melanoma is 4.668 mm thick - code 467 Find the type of cancer you are abstracting in the left column.

A case in a multi-facility database may be associated with more than one facility, and thus may have text for each affiliated facility. Physical Exams Organization Field Name IDRequired accordance with new CDC/NPCR requirements, KCR began requiring text documentation on all new cases diagnosed January 1, 2001 and after. The documentation must include explanations regarding the history and physical, diagnostic procedures, surgeries performed surgical findings and place of diagnosis. Text is needed to justify codes selected for specific data elements and to allow for the recording of information that is not coded at all. It is used by the central registry for quality control of the data and to assure that the data meets the standards of ACoS, NAACCR, NCDB, SEER, and NPCR. It also is utilized to answer questions which arise during the editing and consolidation process performed at the central registry, thus improving the accuracy and timeliness of that process as well. The best code(s) from all sources can generally be selected when the supporting text is sufficient to help verify the decision. Through more complete documentation in the text fields, it is expected that fewer cases will need to be returned to the hospital for further review and/or clarification and that error rates in data abstraction will be reduced.

Specific Data Item Instructions Document the following information as indicated in an appropriate text field category. Sequence Number - Note any history of a previous cancer with emphasis on the most specific site identified and the laterality when multiple primaries involve paired organs. Record date previous cancer diagnosed. Indicate if estimated. Topography Document the exact anatomic location of the primary tumor including lobe, quadrant, etc. as well as laterality if a paired organ. Include any ambiguous terminology used to describe the primary site. Record statements that rule out specific sites when patient has multiple cases of cancer, one of which is an unknown primary. Note unusual topography/histology combinations (i.e., pathologist's diagnosis is endometrioid cancer of uterus - ICD-O-3 shows C56.9 ovary). Histology and Grade Record the exact wording used in the Final Pathologic Diagnosis on the pathology report to support the histology code. If the final histologic diagnosis is an NOS term and a more definitive histology is found in the body of the report or in a special NOTE or COMMENT section, indicate from which section the histologic diagnosis was coded. When a more definitive diagnosis is obtained from a supplementary document such as an immunohistochemistry report or pathologic consultation, note the source document name which provides the final diagnosis. Specify the tumor grade exactly as recorded on the pathology report, i.e., II/III (new in NAACCR).

Codes are those used by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Year 2010 Census. Census tract codes have a 4-digit basic number and also may have a 2-digit suffix. Census tract numbers range from 0001.00 to 9999.98. The Census Bureau provides population data for census tracts. Those rates can be used for general surveillance or special geographical and socioeconomic analysis. Because census tracts for particular cases can change between censuses, the central registry may wish to assign an alternate census tract code to its cases. For example, a registry may code its 2005 cases using both the 2000 and 2010 census tract boundaries. The central registry can use this information for different comparisons.

Rationale A block group is a subdivision of a census tract designed to have an average of 1500 people, versus a census tract's average of 4500 people. All land area in the United States is described by a census block group in the 2010 Census. The Census Bureau publishes detailed population and socioeconomic data at this level. Block groups thus offer a high level of specificity for geographical and socioeconomic analyses. A block group has no meaning in the absence of a census tract. Refer to Census Tract Certainty 2010 to ascertain basis of assignment of Census Block Group 2010. Comment Numerous registries find the distinction between \"attempted, could not be determined\" (zero) and \"not coded\" (blank) to be useful for geocoding planning purposes. Note: The values 1 through 9 are nominal, with no hierarchy of values. This number determines the first digit of all the blocks which comprise the block group; for instance, census block group 3 would contain blocks numbered 3000 to 3999.

This code is used in determining eligibility for several Federal programs, and allows researchers to break county-level data into finer residential groups than the standard metro/non-metro. These codes are based on the June 1993 definition of metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties as determined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Note: Adjacent counties must not only be physically adjacent to a metropolitan area, but have at least 2 percent of the employed labor force in the non-metro county commuting to central metro counties.

The accession number identifies the patient even if multiple primaries exist. The first four digits of the accession number specify the year in which the patient was first seen at the reporting institution for the diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer. The last six numbers are the numerical order the reporting institution entered their first reportable case of this patient into the registry's database. The computer calculates these fields by copying in the accession number of the first abstracted case entered by each reporting institution for this patient. In a single facility database there is only one reporting institution and therefore only one patient accession number for each patient. In a multi-facility database, the patient accession number displayed in the case will be the one associated with the facility in the Class Hospital Id field. ArchiveFIN Organization Field Name IDRequired This field identifies the CoC Facility Identification Number (FIN) of the facility at the time it originally accessioned the case. When a CoC approved facility merges with another facility or joins a network, its unique FIN may change. Archive FIN preserves the identity of the facility at the time the case was initially accessioned so that records resubmitted subsequent to such a reorganization can be recognized as belonging to the same facility. Archive FIN is automatically coded by CPDMS.net. This item never changes and must be included as part of the patient record when data are submitted to the NCDB. For facilities that have not merged, Archive FIN and FIN are the same.

These will be user defined fields based on the individual institution's need or desire to track patterns of diagnostic and other procedures with particular types of cancer patients. For example: The following codes for colon cancers could be established for the first three fields: A. Patient Height B. Patient Weight C. Diagnosed Via Screening Colonoscopy? (Y/N) Census Tract Field Length: 6 For cases diagnosed prior to 1998, the census tract 1970/80/90 code identifies the patient's usual residence when the tumor was diagnosed. The central registry calculates this code from the patient's address at diagnosis. This field is available only in the KCR central registry database and is considered a confidential field. A census tract is a small statistical subdivision of a county. Census tract codes originate from the U.S. Census Bureau, and are constructed using the patient's address. Codes are available from state health departments or the U.S. Census Bureau. Census tracts change as the population changes. To interpret census tract, assume that the decimal point is between the fourth and fifth positions of the field. Add zeros to fill all six positions. EXAMPLE: Census tract 409.6 would be coded 040960, and census tract 516.21 would be coded 051621. Special codes:Code Description 000000 Area is not census tracted 999999 Area is census tracted, but census tract is not available Census Tract Coding System Field Length: 1 A census tract is a small statistical subdivision of a county with (generally) between 2,500 and 8,000 residents. The boundaries of census tracts are established cooperatively by local committees and the Census Bureau. An attempt is made to keep the same boundaries from census to census so that historical comparability will be maintained. This goal is not always achieved; old tracts may be subdivided due to population growth, disappear entirely, or have their boundaries changed. The census tract definition used to code the case's census tract field must be recorded so that data are correctly grouped and analyzed.

Instructions for Coding Code the type of first recurrence. First recurrence may occur well after completion of the first course of treatment or after subsequent treatment. If the patient has never been disease-free (code 70), continue to track for disease-free status. This may occur after subsequent treatment has been completed. If the patient is disease-free (code 00), continue to track until a recurrence occurs. First recurrence may occur well after completion of the first course of treatment. Once a recurrence has been recorded (code 04-62 or 88), subsequent recurrences are NOT to be recorded. Codes 00 through 70 are hierarchical. Record the highest numbered applicable response. If the tumor was originally diagnosed as in situ, code recurrence to 06, 16, 17, 26, 27, 36, or 46 only. Do not use those codes for any other tumors. Codes 00, 88, or 99 may apply to any tumor. Codes 51-59 (organ or organ system of distant recurrence) apply only if all first occurrences were in a single category. There may be multiple metastases (or \"seeding\") within the distant location. Code lymphomas or leukemias that are in remission 00. If the patient relapses, then code recurrence status as 59. If one of these is controlled by drugs (for example Gleevec for CML), the patient is in remission. If there is more than one primary tumor and the physician is unable to decide which has recurred, code the recurrent disease for each tumor. If, at a later date, the recurrent primary is identified, revise the codes as appropriate.

Use all information available in the chart when making an evaluation. If it appears that the patient is disease-free, but no exact date is known, make an estimate. The definition of disease-free status is related to the site of the cancer being studied. With solid tumors, the patient is considered disease-free when there is no reported clinical evidence of any residual tumor (i.e., the pathology report states that the margins are clear) and there is no evidence of cancer in any lymph nodes or metastatic sites. With leukemias, lymphomas, hematopoietic diseases, etc., complete remission is considered a disease-free status.

Therapy Information Data items 50040-50400 Each type of definitive therapy (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, etc.) that the patient received should be recorded in detail in data items 50040-50400. These items may be repeated as often as necessary in order to record every type of treatment administered to the patient. If the same type of treatment is given more than once during a course, it only needs to be recorded one time -- UNLESS the procedure code or treatment agents change. Then, items 50040-50400 would have to be repeated in order to record the differences in those item(s). For example, if a patient has both a lumpectomy and a mastectomy, you would have to complete items 50040-50400 for each instance of surgery because the procedure code is different. See special note for radiation treatment below. Coding Surgery: The CPDMS software uses the same data fields (items 50040-50400) to record both definitive and non-definitive therapies. Non-definitive surgical procedures include incisional biopsies, bypass surgeries, etc., and the codes for these procedures are the same for all types of cancer. Coding non-definitive surgical procedures became required by the ACoS for approved facilities in 1996. Beginning with 2010 diagnoses, KCR requires the first non-definitive surgical procedure which is positive for malignancy to be recorded. The definitive surgical procedure codes are site specific and they are contained in . These surgery codes changed significantly in Appendix G 1998 with the ACoS ROADS Manual, and again in 2003 with the FORDS Manual. Surgery codes collected prior to 1998 were converted to the 1998 ROADS definitions and are stored in data items 50240-50290. Surgeries coded for cancers diagnosed from 1998 to 2002 are also collected in items 50240-50290 and are defined by the ACoS ROADS Manual. Starting with cancers diagnosed in 2003, the site specific surgery codes are stored in data items 50100-50120 and are defined by the ACoS FORDS Manual. Both sets of codes are included in Appendix G. Be sure to use the correct table based on the diagnosis year of the cancer being abstracted. Note on Coding Radiation Treatment: (This is for ACoS approved hospitals and pertains to treatment given to patients diagnosed after January 1, 2003.) You should summarize the entire first course of radiation treatment on one radiation therapy segment. Code all eight new radiation fields implemented with FORDS. If you learn of more radiation given after you have abstracted and entered this patient record, then EDIT the EXISTING radiation treatment segment instead of creating a new radiation therapy record segment. This is important for NCDB submissions. They require one summary record of first course radiation treatment. If there are more in your database, only the one with the earliest start date will be sent to NCDB. If palliative radiation is also given, it must also be recorded in the radiation therapy fields. Each data element and the appropriate codes are further explained on the following pages. Follow-up information about subsequent therapies may be recorded in the same manner as the first course of therapy.

Last-listed responses take precedence over responses written above. Code 98 takes precedence over code 00. Use codes 80 and 90 only if more precise information about the surgery is unavailable. Biopsies that remove all of the tumor and/or leave only microscopic margins are to be coded in this item, even if documented as \"incisional biopsy.\" If a needle biopsy precedes an excisional biopsy or more extensive surgery, and upon the excisional biopsy or more extensive surgery no tumor remains, DO NOT consider the needle biopsy to be an excisional biopsy. Surgery to remove regional tissue or organs is coded in this item only if the tissue/organs are removed in continuity with the primary site, except where noted in - Surgery Codes-FORDS. Appendix G If a previous surgical procedure to remove a portion of the primary site is followed by surgery to remove the remainder of the primary site, then code the total or final results. Example: Enter 2 surgeries, but on the second surgery therapy, use the surgical procedure code that means the complete removal of the organ (or the more extensive surgery). For example, if you have a right thyroid lobectomy code 21) and then later a subtotal thyroidectomy (code 40) which removes all of the remaining thyroid, then use code 50 for Total thyroidectomy in the second surgical treatment code. For all hematopoietic, reticuloendothelial, immunoproliferative, and myeloproliferative diseases, this code is 98.

Collection of this data item was discontinued as of 1/1/2003 with FORDS implementation. \"Surgical Approach\" describes the method used to approach the organ of origin and/or primary tumor. Code the approach for surgical treatments of the primary site only. If no definitive surgical procedure at the primary site was done (\" is coded 00), \"Surgical Surgery of Primary Site\" Approach\" must be coded 0. \"Endoscopy, image guided\" is a generic term for guidance provided by any imaging technique include, but not limited to, CT scans, MRI scans, ultrasound, or radiographic imaging. \"Open\" is a generic term describing all non-scope approaches. Procedures for which \"Surgical Approach\" would be coded open include, but are not limited to, mastectomy; excision of a melanoma of the skin; glossectomy. \"Open, assisted by endoscopy\" means that the scope is being used (present in the body) at the same time the primary tumor is resected. DO NOT CODE a procedure as assisted by endoscopy when the scope is used and removed prior to the resection or when it is inserted and used after the resection of the primary tumor. Example: Patient with lung cancer is taken to the surgical suite. A bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy are done to evaluate whether the lesion is resectable. The scopes are removed before the surgeon performs a wedge resection. Code \"Surgical Approach\" open, NOT assisted by endoscopy. The codes for surgical approach when Therapy type = S are site specific and they are contained in Surgical Codes-ROADS. Appendix G Surg Prim Site (ROADS) Organization Field 1646yes Field Length: 2 When therapy type = S, the Surgery at Primary Site code indicates a definitive surgical treatment for this cancer. Enter the two digit code to indicate the specific surgical procedure performed at the primary cancer site. These codes are listed in - Surgery Codes - ROADS. Appendix G They are site specific codes, as taken from the ACoS Registry Operations and Data Standards Manual, revised for 1998. This data item applies only to cancers diagnosed before 2003. (Surgeries performed on patients diagnosed after 1/1/2003 are recorded in data .) item 50100 Use the following guidelines to complete this field: Only record surgeries of the primary site. Surgery to remove regional tissue or organs is coded in this field only if the tissue/organs are removed with the primary site as part of a specified code definition or in an en bloc resection. An en bloc resection is the removal of organs in one piece at one time. Example: When a patient has a modified radical mastectomy, since the breast and axillary contents are removed in one piece (en bloc), surgery of primary site is coded as a modified radical mastectomy (50) even if the pathology finds no nodes in the specimen. The range of codes from 10-79 are hierarchical and supersede codes '80', '90', and '99'. If more than one code describes the procedure, use the numerically higher code. If surgery was previously done, code the total result of that surgery with the current surgery. Biopsies that remove all gross tumor or leave only microscopic margins should be coded as surgery to the primary site.If there was no surgical procedure at the primary site, code 00. Scope Reg LN (ROADS) Organization Field Name IDRequired Length: 1 This data field applies only to cancers diagnosed before 2003. Collection of this data item was discontinued as of 1/1/2003 with FORDS implementation. For the majority of sites, \"Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery\" defines the removal of regional lymph node(s). This refers to the farthest regional node removed regardless of involvement with disease. There is no minimum number of nodes that must be removed. If at least one regional lymph node was removed, the code for this field must be in the range of 1-5. If a regional lymph node was aspirated or biopsied, enter code '1'. For head and neck sites, this field describes neck dissections. Codes 2-5 indicate only that a neck dissection procedure was done; they do not imply that nodes were found during the pathologic examination of the surgical specimen. Code the neck dissection even if no nodes were found in the specimen. These codes are site specific and they are contained in - Surgery Codes - ROADS. The codes are hierarchical; if more than one Appendix G applies, record the highest code (except 9). A list identifies the regional lymph nodes for each site. Any other nodes are distant; code their removal in the data field \" \". For unknown primaries, leukemias, Surgery of Other Regional Site(s), Distant Site(s) or Distant Lymph Node(s) lymphomas (except lymphomas of the spleen), hematopoietic diseases, and brain primaries code '9' in this field. If no regional lymph nodes were removed, code 0. Nodes which are considered regional are those defined in the AJCC Manual for Staging of Cancer in each site specific chapter. Num LN Removed (ROADS) Organization Field Field Length: 2 This data field applies only to cancers diagnosed before 2003. Collection of this data item was discontinued as of 1/1/2003 with FORDS implementation. Record the number of regional lymph nodes microscopically examined in the pathology report DURING THIS SURGICAL PROCEDURE ONLY. DO NOT add numbers of nodes removed at different surgical events. If no regional lymph nodes are identified in the pathology report, code 00 even if the surgical procedure includes a lymph node dissection (i.e., modified radical mastectomy) or even if the operative report documents removal of nodes. Because this field is not cumulative and not affected by timing, it does not necessarily replace or duplicate the field \"Regional Lymph Node Examined.\" Use the Surgical Codes in to identify the regional lymph nodes for each site.

Code the resection of the lung nodule as 6 (distant site). Code the removal of non-primary tissue which was removed because the surgeon suspected it was involved with malignancy even if the pathology is negative. DO NOT CODE the incidental removal of tissue. Incidental is defined as tissue removed for reasons other than the malignancy. For example: During a colon resection, the surgeon noted that the patient had cholelithiasis and removed the gall bladder. Do not code removal of the gall bladder.

It must be a restoration of primary site or organ. \"Reconstruction/Restoration - First Course\" is limited to procedures started during the first course of therapy. Some reconstructive/restorative procedures involve several surgical events. Code as \"Reconstructive/Restoration - First Course\" if the first event occurred during the first course of treatment. Each site-specific surgery code scheme in - Surgery Codes-ROADS has either a list of reconstructive/restorative procedures or Appendix G codes that define specific procedures.

Only the agent is coded, not the method of drug administration (i.e., chemoembolization). One planned course of chemotherapy may be given in multiple segments or cycles (i.e., CHOP x 6). Record as a single course of therapy. If the patient has an adverse reaction to a particular chemotherapeutic drug, the physician may substitute another If the replacement drug belongs to the same group as the original drug, it is considered to be the same regimen for coding purposes. If the replacement drug is in a different group than the original drug, code as a new subsequent course of therapy. Two or more single agents given at separate times during the first course of cancer-directed therapy are considered a combination regimen andcoded 3 (chemotherapy, multiple agents). If an agent in a combination regimen is a hormone (such as Prednisone in CHOP), code '3' here and record the hormonal agent again, under . Hormone therapy When chemotherapeutic agents are used as radiosensitizers or radioprotectants, they are given at a much lower dosage and do not affect the cancer. Radiosensitizers and radioprotectants are classified as ancillary drugs. Do not code as chemotherapy.

There may be secondary regional lymph node irradiation as well. 10Chest/lung (NOS) Radiation therapy is directed to some combination of hilar, mediastinal, and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes, and/or peripheral lung structures. 11Lung (limited) Radiation therapy is directed at one region of the lung without nodal irradiation. 12Esophagus The primary target is some portion of the esophagus. Regional lymph nodes may or may not be included in the treatment. Include tumors of the gastroesophageal junction. 13Stomach The primary malignancy is in the stomach. Radiation is directed to the stomach and possibly adjacent lymph nodes. 14Liver The primary target is all or a portion of the liver, for either primary or metastatic disease. 15Pancreas The primary tumor is in the pancreas. The treatment field encompasses the pancreas and possibly adjacent lymph node regions. 16Kidney The target is primary or metastatic disease in the kidney or the kidney bed after resection of a primary kidney tumor. Adjacent lymph node regions may be included in the field. 17Abdomen (NOS) Include all treatment of abdominal contents that do not fit codes 12-16. 18Breast The primary target is the intact breast and no attempt has been made to irradiate the regional lymph nodes. 19Breast/lymph nodes A deliberate attempt has been made to include regional lymph nodes in the treatment of an intact breast. 20Chest wall Treatment encompasses the chest wall (following mastectomy). 21Chest wall/lymph nodes Treatment encompasses the chest wall (following mastectomy) plus fields directed at regional lymph nodes.22Mantle, mini-mantle Treatment consists of a large radiation field designed to encompass all of the regional lymph nodes above the diaphragm, including cervical, supraclavicular axillary, mediastinal, and hilar nodes (mantel), or most of them (mini-mantle). This code is used exclusively for patients with Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 23Lower extended field The target zone includes lymph nodes below the diaphragm along th paraaortic chain. It may include extension to one side of the pelvis. This code includes the 'hockey stick' field utilized to treat seminomas. 24Spine The primary target relates to the bones of the spine, including the sacrum. Spinal cord malignancies should be coded 40 (Spinal cord). 25Skull Treatment is directed at the bones of the skull. Any brain irradiation is a secondary consequence. 26Ribs Treatment is directed toward metastatic disease in one or more ribs. Fields may be tangential or direct. 27Hip The target includes the proximal femur for metastatic disease. In many cases there may be acetabular disease as well. 28Pelvic Bones The target includes structures of the bones of the pelvis other than the hip or sacrum. 29Pelvis (NOS) Irradiation is directed at soft tissues within the pelvic region and codes 34-36 do not apply. 30Skin The primary malignancy originates in the skin and the skin is the primary target. So-called skin metastasis are usually subcutaneous and should be coded 31 (soft tissue). 31Soft tissue All treatment of primary or metastatic soft tissue malignancies not fitting other categories. 32Hemibody A single treatment volume encompassing either all structures above the diaphragm, or all structures below the diaphragm. This is almost always administered for palliation of widespread bone metastasis in patients with prostate or breast cancer. 33Whole body Entire body included in a single treatment. 34Bladder and pelvis The primary malignancy originated in the bladder, all or most of the pelvis is treated as prat of the plan, typically with a boost to the bladder. 35Prostate and pelvis The primary malignancy originated in the prostate, all or most of the pelvis is treated as part of the plan, typically with a boost to the prostate. 36Uterus and cervix Treatment is confined to the uterus and cervix or vaginal cuff, usually by intracavitary or interstitial technique. If entire pelvis is included in a portion of the treatment, then code 29 (Pelvis, NOS). 37Shoulder Treatment is directed to the proximal humerus, scapula, clavicle, or other components of the shoulder complex. This is usually administered for control of symptoms for metastasis. 38Extremity bone, NOS Bones of the arms or legs. This excludes the proximal femur, code 27 (Hip). This excludes the proximal humerus, code 37 (Shoulder). 39Inverted Y Treatment has been given to a field that encompasses the paraaortic and bilateral inguinal or inguinofemoral lymph nodes in a single port. 40Spinal Cord Treatment is directed at the spinal cord or its meninges.41Prostate Treatment is directed at the prostate with or without the seminal vesicles, without regional lymph node treatment. 50Thyroid Treatment is directed at the thyroid gland. 60Lymph node region, NOS The target is a group of lymph nodes not listed above. Examples include isolated treatment of a cervical, supraclavicular, or inguinofemoral region. 98Other Radiation therapy administered, treatment volume other than those previously categorized. 99Unknown Radiation therapy administered, treatment volume unknown or not stated in patient record; it is unknown if radiation therapy was administered. Regional Tx Modality Organization Records the dominant modality of radiation therapy used to deliver the most clinically significant regional dose to the primary volume of interest during the first course of treatment. It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale Radiation treatment is frequently delivered in two or more phases which can be summarized as \"regional\" and \"boost\" treatments. To evaluate patterns of radiation oncology care, it is necessary to know which radiation resources were employed in the delivery of therapy. For outcomes analysis, the modalities used for each of these phases can be very important. Instructions for Coding Radiation treatment modality will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Segregation of treatment components into regional and boost and determination of the respective treatment modality may require assistance from the radiation oncologist to ensure consistent coding. In the event multiple radiation therapy modalities were employed in the treatment of the patient, record only the dominant modality. Note that in some circumstances the boost treatment may precede the regional treatment. For purposes of this data item, photons and x-rays are equivalent. CodeLabel Description 20External beam, NOS The treatment is known to be by external beam, but there is insufficient information to determine the specific modality. 21Orthovoltage External beam therapy administered using equipment with a maximum energy of less than one (1) million volts (MV). Orthovoltage energies are typically expressed in units of kilovolts (kV). 22Cobalt-60, Cesium-137 External beam therapy using a machine containing either a Cobalt-60 or Cesium-137 source. Intracavitary use of these sources is coded either 50 or 51.23Photons (2-5 MV) External beam therapy using a photon producing machine with a beam energy in the range of 2-5 MV. 24Photons (6-10 MV) External beam therapy using a photon producing machine with a beam energy in the range of 6-10 MV. 25Photons (11-19 MV) External beam therapy using a photon producing machine with a beam energy in the range of 11-19 MV. 26Photons (>19 MV) External beam therapy using a photon producing machine with a beam energy of more than 19 MV. 27Photons (mixed energies) External beam therapy using more than one energy over the course of treatment. 28Electrons Treatment delivered by electron beam. 29Photons and electrons mixed Treatment delivered using a combination of photon and electron beams. 30Neutrons, with or without photons/electronsTreatment delivered using neutron beam. 31IMRT Intensity modulated radiation therapy, an external beam technique that should be clearly stated in patient record. 32Conformal or 3-D therapy An external beam technique using multiple, fixed portals shaped to conform to a defined target volume.

Regional Dose Organization Field Name IDRequired Length: 5 Description Records the dominant or most clinically significant total dose of regional radiation therapy delivered to the patient during the first course of treatment. The unit of measure is centigray (cGy). It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale To evaluate patterns of radiation oncology care, it is necessary to capture information describing the prescribed regional radiation dose. Outcomes are strongly related to the dose delivered. Instructions for Coding The International Council for Radiation Protection (ICRP) recommends recording doses at the axis point where applicable (opposed fields, four field box, wedged pair, and so on). For maximum consistency in this data item, the ICRP recommendations should be followed whenever possible. Where there is no clear axis point, record the dose as indicated in the summary chart. Determining the exact dose may be highly subjective and require assistance from the radiation oncologist for consistent coding. Regional dose will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Determination of the total dose of regional therapy may require assistance from the radiation oncologist for consistent coding. For photon treatment, dosage is reported in cGe units (Cobalt Grey Equivalent) rather than cGy. You must multiply cGe by 100 to get cGy. Do not include the boost dose, if one was administered. Code 88888 when brachytherapy or radioisotopes - codes 50-62 for Regional Treatment Modality - were administered to the patient. Note that dose is still occasionally specified in \"rads.\" One rad is equivalent to one centigray (cGy). Code Description (fill spaces) Record the actual regional dose delivered. 88888 Not applicable, brachytherapy or radioisotopes administered to the patient. 99999 Regional radiation therapy was administered, but the dose is unknown; it is unknown whether radiation therapy was administered. Boost Tx ModalityOrganization Records the dominant modality of radiation therapy used to deliver he most clinically significant boost dose to the primary volume of interest during the first course of treatment. This is accomplished with external beam fields of reduced size (relative to the regional treatment fields), implants, stereotactic radiosurgery, conformal therapy, or IMRT. External beam boosts may consist of two or more successive phases with progressively smaller fields generally coded as a single entity. It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale Radiation treatment is frequently delivered in two or more phases which can be summarized as \"regional\" and \"boost\" treatments. To evaluate patterns of radiation oncology care, it is necessary to know which radiation resources were employed in the delivery of therapy. For outcomes analysis, the modalities used for each of these phases can be very important. Instructions for Coding Radiation boost treatment modalities will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Segregation of treatment components into regional and boost and determination of the respective treatment modality may require assistance from the radiation oncologist to ensure consistent coding. In the event that multiple radiation therapy boost modalities were employed during the treatment of the patient, record only the dominant modality.

Boost DoseOrganization Field Name IDRequired Field Length: 5 Description Records the additional dose delivered to that part of the treatment volume encompassed by the boost fields or devices. The unit of measure is centiGray (cGy). It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale To evaluate patterns of radiation oncology care, it is necessary to capture information describing the prescribed boost radiation dose. Outcomes are strongly related to the dose delivered. Instructions for Coding The International Council for Radiation (ICRP) recommends recording doses at the axis point where applicable (opposed fields, four field box, wedged pair, and so on). For maximum consistency in this data item, the ICRP recommendations should be followed whenever possible. Where there is no clear axis point, record the dose as indicated in the summary chart. Consult the radiation oncologist for the exact dose, if necessary. Radiation boost treatment will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Determination of the additional boost dose of radiation therapy may require assistance from the radiation oncologist for consistent coding. Do not include the regional dose. In general, the boost dose will be calculated as the difference between the maximum prescribed dose and the regional dose. Many patients will not have a boost. Code 88888 when brachytherapy or radioisotopes - codes 50-62 for Boost Treatment Modality - were administered to the patient. Note that dose is still occasionally specified in \"rads\" One rad is equivalent to one centiGray (cGy). Code Description (fill spaces) Record the actual regional dose delivered. 88888 Not applicable, brachytherapy or radioisotopes administered to the patient. 99999 Regional radiation therapy was administered, but the dose is unknown; it is unknown whether radiation therapy was administered. Num Treatments This Volume Organization Field Name IDRequired KCR Num Treatments This Volume Treatment Vol 1520no Field Length: 3 Description Records the total number of treatment sessions (fractions) administered during the first course of treatment. It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale This data item is used to evaluate patterns of radiation therapy and the treatment schedules.Instructions for Coding The number of treatments or fractions will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Determination of the exact number of treatments or fractions delivered to the patient may require assistance from the radiation oncologist for consistent coding. Although a treatment session may include several treatment portals delivered within relatively confined period of time - usually a few minutes - it is still considered one session. The total number of treatment sessions (fractions) is the sum of the number of fractions of regional treatment and the number of fractions of boost treatment. Code Label Description 000 None Radiation therapy was not administered to the patient. Diagnosed at autopsy. 001-998 Number of TreatmentsTotal number of treatment sessions administered to the patient. 999 Unknown Radiation therapy was administered, but the number of treatments is unknown. Or, it is unknown whether radiation therapy was administered. Death certificate only. Examples: 025 - A patient with breast carcinoma had treatment sessions in which treatment was delivered to the chest wall and separately to the ipsilateral supraclavicular region for a total of three treatment portals. Twenty-five treatment sessions were given. Record 25 treatments. 035 - A patient with Stage IIIB bronchogenic carcinoma received 25 treatments to the left hilum and mediastinum, given in 25 daily treatments over five weeks. A left hilar boost was then given in 10 additional treatments. Record 35 treatments. 050 - A patient with advanced head and neck cancer was treated using \"hyperfractionation.\" Three fields were delivered in each session, two sessions were given each day, six hours apart, with each session delivering a total dose of 150 cGy. Treatment was given for a total of 25 days. Record 50 treatments. Date Radiation Ended Organization Field Name IDRequired KCR Date Radiation Ended (RadLastDate) 50370no NAACCR RX Date Rad Ended 3220no Field Length: 8 Description The date on which the patient completes or received the last radiation treatment at any facility. It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale The length of time over which radiation therapy is administered to a patient is a factor in tumor control and treatment morbidity. It is useful to evaluate the quality of care and the success of patient support programs designed to maintain continuity of treatment. Instructions for Coding The date when treatment ended will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment.

For example, a patient has advanced lung cancer with multiple metastases to the brain. The physician orders Decadron to reduce the edema in the brain and relieve the neurological symptons. Decadron is not coded as hormone therapy. Or, a patient with advanced disease is given Prednisone to stimulate the appetite and improve nutritional status. Do not code the Prednisone as hormone therapy. Some types of cancers are slowed or suppressed by hormones. These cancers are treated by administering hormones. Example 1: Endometrial cancer may be treated with progesterone. Code all administration of progesterone to patients with endometrial cancer in this field. Even if the progesterone is given for menopausal symptoms, it has an effect on the growth or recurrence of endometrial cancer. Example 2: Follicular and papillary cell cancers of the thyroid are often treated with thyroid hormone to suppress serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). If a patient with 8340, or 8346) is given a thyroid hormone, code the treatment in this field. Tumor involvement or treatment may destroy hormone-producing tissue. Hormone replacement therapy will be given if the hormone is necessary to maintain normal metabolism and body function. Do not code hormone replacement therapy as part of first course therapy, except for thyroid replacement therapy, as described above. Use the SEER Rx program (available from web site: ) to identify hormonal agents. For pre-2005 http://seer.cancer.gov/tools/seerrx/ diagnoses, refer to and to the Self-Instructional Manual for Tumor Registrars: Book 8 - Antineoplastic Drugs, Third Edition. Appendix H Code surgery or radiation given for hormonal effect under Transplant/Endocrine Procedures ( ). Item # 50220 if immunotherapy was administered as first course treatment at this or any other facilities. Immunotherapy consists of biological or chemical agents that alter the immune system or change the host's response to tumor cells. Types of immunotherapy Cancer Vaccines: Cancer vaccines are still in the experimental phase and are not coded in this data item. They may be coded in the field Other Therapy. Currently clinical trials use cancer vaccines for brain, breast, colon, kidney, lung, melanoma and ovary. Interferons: Interferons belong to a group of proteins called cytokines. They are produced naturally by the white blood cells in the body. Interferon-alpha is able to slow tumor growth directly as well as activate the immune system. It is used for a number of cancers including multiple myeloma, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hairy cell leukemia, and malignant melanoma. Interleukins (IL-2) are often used to treat kidney cancer and melanoma. Monoclonal Antibodies: Prior to 2005, monoclonal antibodies were coded as immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies are produced in a laboratory. The artificial antibodies are injected into the patient to seek out and disrupt cancer cell activities and to enhance the immune response against the cancer. For example, Rituximab (Rituxan) may be used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and trastuzumab (Herceptin) may be used for certain breast cancers. With the introduction of SEER Rx in 2005 for coding systemic therapy, monoclonal antibodies are coded as chemotherapy if they act as cytostatic agents (such as Rituxan and Herceptin) or as radioisotopes if they deliver cytotoxic radioisotopes to the cells (such as Bexxar and Zevalin). Effective with diagnoses in 2005 and later, use the SEER Rx program (available from web site: ) to identify http://seer.cancer.gov/tools/seerrx/ immunotherapeutic agents. For pre-2005 cases, refer to and to the Self-Instructional Manual for Tumor Registrars: Book 8 - Appendix H Antineoplastic Drugs, Third Edition. Trans EndoTransplant/Endocrine Code Transplant/Endocrine 2 Record any systemic therapeutic procedures administered as part of the first course of treatment at this and all other facilities. These include bone marrow transplants, stem cell harvests, surgical and/or radiation endocrine therapy. Instructions for Coding Bone marrow transplants should be coded as either autologous (bone marrow originally taken from the patient) or allogeneic (bone marrow donated by a person other than the patient). For cases in which the bone marrow transplant was syngeneic (transplanted marrow from an identical twin), the item is coded as allogeneic. Stem cell harvests involve the collection of immature blood cells from the patient and the reintroduction by transfusion of the harvested cells following chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Endocrine irradiation and/or endocrine surgery are procedures which suppress the naturally occurring hormonal activity of the patient and thus alter or effect the long-term control of the cancer's growth. These procedures must be bilateral to qualify as endocrine surgery or endocrine radiation. If only one gland is intact at the start of treatment, surgery and/or radiation to that remaining gland qualifies as endocrine surgery or endocrine radiation. CodeDescription 10A bone marrow transplant procedure was administered, but the type was not specified. 11Bone marrow transplant - autologous. 12Bone marrow transplant - allogeneic. 20Stem cell harvest (and infusion). 30Endocrine surgery and/or endocrine radiation therapy. 40Combination of endocrine surgery and/or radiation with a transplant procedure.

Other Other Therapy Code Other Therapy Code Organization Field Name IDRequired KCR 1 These codes available for any 'other' treatment received by the patient-- other than surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, transplants or endocrine procedures. Code 0 indicates nonsurgical types of non-definitive treatment. These are optional and do not have to be recorded. Ancillary drugs such as allopurinol, growth stimulating factors (i.e., Neupogen and Epogen) and antibiotics for MALT lymphoma are examples of non-definitive therapy. CodeLabel Description 0Non- cancer directed treatmentOPTIONAL CODE - may be used to record ancillary drugs, supportive care, stent placement, etc. 1Other treatmentCancer treatment that cannot be appropriately assigned to specified treatment data items (surgery, radiation, systemic). Examples include treatment unique to hematopoietic diseases (see Notes below), tumor embolization which does not involve a chemotherapy or radiotherapy agent (i.e., when alcohol is used as the embolizing agent in head and neck cancers), photophoresis for thin or for mycosis fungoides, and PUVA (psoralen and long-wave ultraviolet radiation). 2Other - Experimental This code is not defined. It may be used to record participation in institution-based clinical trials. Gene therapy is coded 2. 3Other - Double Blind A patient is involved in a double-blind clinical trial. Code the treatment actually administered when the double-blind trial code is broken. 6Other - UnprovenUnconventional therapies; alternative and complementary therapies (see below). Treatment for certain reportable hematopoietic diseases can be supportive care that does not meet the usual definition of treatment which \"modifies, controls, removes, or destroys proliferating cancer tissue.\" Such treatments include phlebotomy, transfusions, and aspirin (see Notes below), and should be coded 1. Notes for Hematopoietic diseases: The hematopoietic diseases for which transfusions may be coded as other therapy are comprised of the following histologies ONLY: 9945, 9980, 9982-9986, and 9989. Do not therapy for leukemias, lymphomas, or other hematopoietic histologies not on the previous list. Transfusions may include whole blood, RBCs, platelets, plateletpheresis, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), plasmapheresis, and cryoprecipitate. Phlebotomy may be coded as other therapy only for 9950/3, polycythemia vera. Phlebotomy may be called blood removal, blood letting, or venisection. Aspirin (also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), or by a brand name) is coded as other therapy for 9962/3, essential thrombocythemia. Record aspirin therapy ONLY if given to thin the blood for symptomatic control of thrombocythemia. To determine whether aspirin is administered for pain, cardiovascular protection, or thinning of platelets in the blood, use the following general guideline: -Pain control is approximately 325-1000 mg every 3-4 hours. -Cardiovascular protection starts at about 160 mg/day. -Aspirin treatment for essential thrombocythemia is low dose, approximately 70-100 mg/day. Use code 3 - Double blind for clinical trial before the code is broken. After the code is broken, review and re-code therapy as needed, according to the treatment actually administered. Use code 6 - Unproven therapy - for unconventional methods whether they are given alone or in combination with other cancer directed treatments. Unconventional treatment agents are: code 6 - Unproven therapy - for alternative and complementary therapies ONLY if they are NOT given in combination with other cancer directed treatments.

The surgery codes are identical to FORDS but the SEER appendix also contains supplementary annotations, including the 2007 MP/H rules and Collaborative Staging coding instructions. It can be found at:https://seer.cancer.gov/manuals/2016/appendixc.html To download the 2016 FORDS Manual, go to: https://www.facs.org/~/media/files/quality%20programs/cancer/ncdb/fords%202016.ashx For diagnoses prior to January 1, 2003, use the ROADS surgery codes, which can be found at: http://seer.cancer.gov/manuals/AppendC.pdf Appendix H - Therapy Agents For cases diagnosed from 2005 onward, the SEER Rx software should be used to identify and categorize treatment agents as chemotherapy, hormone agents, immunotherapy or ancillary agents. (Ancillary agents are not considered treatment.) The software is available from the SEER web page: https://seer.cancer.gov/seertools/seerrx/ It looks like this: The rest of Appendix H is to be used for diagnoses made prior to 2005. THERAPY AGENTS (PRE-2005) (Alphabetical Listing) Helpful Information *Different names for the same agent are separated by commas (,) within a line. *Individual agents in combo regimens are separated by forward slashes (/).*Some combo regimens consist of chemotherapy and hormone therapy agents (C, H); both categories should be entered as therapies. *When looking up a combo regimen by the individual agents, begin searching for the agent that comes alphabetically first. If it is not listed under that agent begin searching for the agent that comes alphabetically next, etc. Remember that agents listed as a part of a combo regimen may be known by different names (synonyms).

Appendix J - ICD-O-3 Errata and Clarifications These can be found at: . http://www.seer.cancer.gov/icd-o-3/ Appendix K - Race Coding Rules and Tables (Effective with 2004 diagnoses) Race (and ethnicity) is defined by specific physical, hereditary and cultural traditions or origins, not necessarily by birthplace, place of residence, or citizenship. 'Origin' is defined by the US Census Bureau as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or in some cases, the country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. All resources in the facility, including the medical record, face sheet, physician and nursing notes, photographs, and any other sources, must be used to determine race. If a facility does not print race in the medical record but does maintain it in electronic form, the electronic data must also be reviewed. Recommendation: document how the race code was determined in a text field. Coding Instructions 1. Code the primary race(s) of the patient in fields Race 1, Race 2, Race 3, Race 4, and Race 5. The five race fields allow for the coding of multiple races consistent with the Census 2000. Rules 2 - 8 further specify how to code Race 1, Race 2, Race 3, Race 4 and Race 5. 2. If a person's race is a combination of white and any other race(s), code the appropriate other race(s) first and code white in the next race field. 3. If a person's race is a combination of Hawaiian and any other race(s), code Race 1 as 07 Hawaiian and code the other races in Race 2, Race 3, Race 4, and Race 5 as appropriate. Example: Patient is described as Japanese and Hawaiian. Code Race 1 as 07 Hawaiian, Race 2 as 05 Japanese, and Race 3 through Race 5 as 88. 4. If the person is not Hawaiian, code Race 1 to the first stated non-white race (02-98). Example: Patient is stated to be Vietnamese and Black. Code Race 1 as 10 Vietnamese, Race 2 as 02 Black, and Race 3 through Race 5 as 88. Note: in the following scenarios, only the race code referred to in the example is coded. For cases diagnosed after January 1, 2000, all race fields must be coded. 5. The fields Place of Birth, Race, Marital Status, Name, Maiden Name, and Hispanic Origin are inter-related. Use the following guidelines in priority order: a. Code the patient's stated race, if possible. Refer to Appendix \"Race and Nationality Descriptions from the 2000 Census and Bureau of Vital Statistics\" for guidance.Example 1: Patient is stated to be Japanese. Code as 05 Japanese. Example 2: Patient is stated to be German-Irish. Code as 01 White. Example 3: Patient is described as Arabian. Code as 01 White. Exception: When the race is recorded as Oriental, Mongolian, or Asian (coded to 96 Other Asian) and the place of birth is recorded as China, Japan, the Philippines, or another Asian nation, code the race based on birthplace information. Example 4: The person's race is recorded as Asian and the place of birth is recorded as Japan. Code race as 05 Japanese because it is more specific than 96 Asian, NOS. Example 5: The person describes himself as an Asian-American born in Laos. Code race as 11 Laotian because it is more specific than 96 Asian, NOS. 6. If the patient's race is determined on the basis of the races of relatives, there is no priority to coding race, other than to list the non-white race(s) first. Example: The patient is described as Asian-American with Korean parents. Code race as 08 Korean because it is more specific than 96 Asian [-American]. 7. If no race is stated in the medical record, or if the stated race cannot be coded, review the documentation for a statement of a race category. Example 1: Patient described as a black female. Code as 02 Black. Example 2: Patient describes herself as multi-racial (nothing more specific) and nursing notes say \"African-American.\" Code as 02 Black. Example 3: Patient states she has a Polynesian mother and Tahitian father. Code Race 1 as 25 Polynesian, Race 2 as 26 Tahitian and Race 3 through Race 5 as 88. 8. If race is unknown or not stated in the medical record and birth place is recorded, in some cases race may be inferred from the nationality. Refer to the Appendix entitled \"Race and Nationality Descriptions from the 2000 Census and Bureau of Vital Statistics\" to identify nationalities from which race codes may be inferred. Example 1: Record states: \"this native of Portugal...\" Code race as 01 White per the Appendix. Example 2: Record states: \"this patient was Nigerian...\" Code race as 02 Black per the Appendix. Exception: If the patient's name is incongruous with the race inferred on the basis of nationality, code Race 1 through Race 5 as 99, Unknown. Example 1: Patient's name is Siddhartha Rao and birthplace is listed as England. Code Race 1 through Race 5 as 99 Unknown. Example 2: Patient's name is Ping Chen and birthplace is Ethiopia. Code Race 1 through Race 5 as 99 Unknown. 9. Use of patient name in determining race: a. Do not code race from name alone, especially for females with no maiden name given. b. In general, a name may be an indicator of a racial group, but should not be taken as the only indicator of race. c. A patient name may be used to identify a more specific race code. Example 1: Race reported as Asian, name is Hatsu Mashimoto. Code race as 05 Japanese.Example 2: Birthplace is reported as Guatemala and name is Jose Chuicol [name is identified as Mayan]. Code race as 03 Native American d. A patient name may be used to infer Spanish ethnicity or place of birth, but a Spanish name alone (without a statement about race or place of birth) cannot be used to determine the race code. Refer to ethnicity guidelines for further information. Example: Alice Gomez is a native of Indiana (implied birthplace: United States). Code Race 1 through Race 5 as 99 Unknown, because nothing is known about her race. 10. Persons of Spanish or Hispanic origin may be of any race, although persons of Mexican, Central American, South American, Puerto Rican, or Cuban origin are usually white. Do NOT code a patient stated to be Hispanic or Latino as 98 Other Race in Race 1 and 88 in Race 2 through Race 5. Example: Sabrina Fitzsimmons is a native of Brazil. Code race as 01 White per Appendix. 11. When the race is recorded as Negro or African-American, code race as 02 Black. 12. Code 03 should be used for any person stated to be Native American or [western hemisphere] Indian, whether from North, Central, South, or Latin America. For Central, South, or Latin American Indians, see additional ethnicity coding guidelines under Spanish Surname or Origin. 13. Death certificate information may be used to supplement antemortem race information only when race is coded unknown in the patient record or when the death certificate information is more specific. Example 1: In the cancer record Race 1 through Race 5 are coded as 99 Unknown. The death certificate states race as black. Change cancer record for Race 1 to 02 Black and Race 2 through Race 5 to 88. Example 2: Race 1 is coded in the cancer record as 96 Asian. Death certificate gives birthplace as China. Change Race 1 in the cancer record to 04 Chinese and code Race 2 through Race 5 as 88. Race and nationality descriptions from the 2000 Census and Bureau of Vital Statistics can be found at: https://seer.cancer.gov/manuals/2016/SPCSM_2016_AppendixD.pdf Appendix L - Frequent Surnames A list of frequently occurring heavily Hispanic surnames compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau may be found at: http://www.census.gov/population/documentation/twpno13.pdf on page 20. Appendix M - Supplemental ICD-10-CM Codes These ICD-10-CM and ICD-9-CM codes may also be used for casefinding. The detailed casefinding list contains each individual reportable code. ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM Supplemental casefinding lists follow. Many of these codes are for diseases associated with cancer or represent neoplasm-related secondary conditions. Experience among the SEER registries has proven that using the supplementary list significantly improves casefinding outcomes for benign brain and CNS tumors, hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms, and other reportable diseases. It is recommended that each registry screen cases using the supplementary list as time permits.

For cancers, the grade is a measurement of how closely the tumor cells resemble the parent tissue (organ of origin). Well differentiated tumor cells closely resemble the tissue from the organ of origin. Poorly differentiated and undifferentiated tumor cells are disorganized and abnormal looking; they bear little or no resemblance to the tissue from the organ of origin. Pathologists describe the tumor grade by levels of similarity. Pathologists may define the tumor by describing two levels of similarity (two-grade system which may be used for colon); by describing three levels of similarity (three-grade system); or by describing four levels of similarity (four-grade system). The four-grade system describes the tumor as grade I, grade II, grade III, and grade IV (also called well differentiated, moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated, and undifferentiated/anaplastic). These similarities/differences may be based on pattern (architecture), cytology, or nuclear features or a combination of these elements depending upon the grading system that is used. The information from this data item is useful for determining prognosis.Cell Indicator (Codes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) - for hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies Cell indicator codes describe the lineage or phenotype of the cell that became malignant. If marker studies are not documented in the record, then code information on cell type from any source (i.e., history & physical). These codes apply to lymphomas and leukemias. Cell indicator codes take precedence over grade/differentiation codes for lymphoma and leukemia cases. Do not use grade,\" \"low grade,\" or \"intermediate grade\" descriptions of lymphomas as a basis for differentiation. These terms are categories in the Working Formulation of Lymphoma Diagnoses and do not relate to grade/differentiation. For all hematopoietic and lymphoma cases diagnosed January 1, 2010 forward, use the guidelines in Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Case Reportability and Coding Manual to code grade. For cases diagnosed prior to that date, see the ICD-O-3 chapter Morphology for further instructions on coding grade. Codes CodeGrade/Cell Label 1Grade I, 1, i Well differentiated; differentiated, NOS 2Grade II, 2, ii I/III or 1/3Moderately differentiated; moderately well differentiated; intermediate or cell; pre-B; B-percursor 7 Null cell; non T- non B 8 NK (natural killer) cell (effective with diagnosis 1/1/95 and after) For Use in All Histologies 9 Cell type not determined, not stated or not applicable; unknown primary; high grade dysplasia General Coding Instructions The site specific coding guidelines in Appendix C of the SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual include instructions for coding grade for the following primary sites/histologies: colon, breast, prostate, kidney, renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, urethra, astrocytoma, and sarcoma. Site-specific instructions take priority over general instructions. Code the grade or differentiation as stated in the final pathologic diagnosis. If grade is not stated in the final pathologic diagnosis, use the information from the microscopic description or comments. Record the tumor grade from the pathology report prior to neoadjuvant treatment. If there is no pathology report prior to neoadjuvant treatment, assign code 9. Code the grade from the primary tumor only, never from a metastatic site or a recurrence. Code to 9 when the primary site is unknown. If more than one grade is recorded for a single tumor, code the highest grade, even if it is a focus. Differentiation has priority over nuclear grade when both are specified. (Example: Liver biopsy histology described as \"well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, nuclear grade 2/4.\" Code the tumor grade as grade 1.) Code the grade for in situ lesions if it is available. Code the grade of the invasive component when the tumor has both in situ and invasive portions. If the grade of the invasive component is unknown, code tumor grade as 9. Do not code the grade assigned to dysplasia (Example: High grade dysplasia (adenocarcinoma in situ). Code to 9 (unknown).) Code the grade of tumor given on a CT scan, MRI, or PET report only if there is no tissue diagnosis Do not use WHO grade to code this data item Some terms in ICD-O-3 carry an implied statement of grade. These histologies must be reported with the correct grade as stated below even if another grade is given or the primary site is unknown (C80.9): 8020/34 Carcinoma, undifferentiated Terminology Conversion Table Description Grade SEER Code Differentiated, NOS I 1 Well differentiated I 1 Fairly well differentiated II 2 Intermediate differentiation II 2 Low grade I-II 2 Mid differentiated II 2 Moderately differentiated II 2 Moderately well differentiated II 2 Partially differentiated II 2 Partially well differentiated I-II 2 Relatively or generally well differentiated II 2 Medium grade, intermediate grade II-III 3Moderately poorly differentiated III 3 Moderately undifferentiated III 3 Poorly differentiated III 3 Relatively poorly differentiated III 3 Relatively undifferentiated III 3 Slightly differentiated III 3 Dedifferentiated III 3 High grade III-IV 4 Undifferentiated, anaplastic, not differentiated IV 4 Non-high grade 9 - Two-Grade System Two grade systems apply to colon, rectosigmoid junction, rectum (C18.0-C20.9), and heart (C38.0). Code these sites using a two-grade system- Low Grade (2) or High Grade (4). If the grade is listed as 1/2 or as Low Grade, use code 2. If the grade is listed as 2/2 or as High Grade, use code 4. CodeTerminology Histologic Grade 2Low grade 1/2 4High grade 2/2 -Three-Grade System There are several sites for which a three-grade system is used: peritoneum, endometrium, fallopian tubes, bladder, brain and spinal cord, and soft tissue sarcoma. For these sites, code the tumor grade using the following priority order: (1) terminology, (2) histologic grade, and (3) nuclear grade as show in the table below. The patterns of cell growth are measured on a scale of 1, 2, and 3 (also referred to as low, medium, and high grade). This system measures the proportion of cancer cells that are growing and making new cells and how closely they resemble the cells of the host tissue. Thus, it is similar to a four-grade system, but simply divides the spectrum into three rather than four categories (see comparison table below). The expected outcome is more favorable for lower grades. If the grade is written as 2/3, that means this is a grade 2 of a 3 grade system; do not simply code the numerator. Use the following table to convert the grade to the correct code. CodeTerminology 2Low grade, well to moderately differentiated; I/III or 1/3 3Medium grade, intermediate grade, moderately undifferentiated, relatively undifferentiated; II/III or 4High grade; poorly differentiated to undifferentiated; III/III or 3/3 Refer to the following instructions for breast, kidney, prostate, and CNS tumors.-Breast (C50.0-C50.9) For breast cancers, code the tumor grade using the following priority order: 1) Bloom-Richardson (Nottingham) Scores 3-9; 2) Bloom-Richardson Grade (low, intermediate, high); 3) Nuclear Grade only; 4) Terminology; and 5) Differentiation (well differentiated, moderately differentiated, etc.); 6) Histologic Grade. BLOOM-RICHARDSON GRADING FOR BREAST CANCER Bloom-Richardson, Scarff-Bloom-Richardson, grading. The Bloom-Richardson grading scheme is based on numeric scores assigned to three different morphologic features of invasive, no-special-type breast cancers (degree of tubule formation/histologic grade, mitotic activity, and nuclear pleomorphism of tumor cells). Use the table below to convert BR score, grade, or terminology: BR Scores BR Grade Nuclear Grade Terminology Histologic Grade Code 3-5 Low 1/3; 1/2 Well differentiated I, I/III, 1/3 1 6, 7 Intermediate 2/3 Moderately differentiated II, II/III, 2/3 2 8, 9 High 2/2; 3/3 Poorly differentiated III, III/III, 3/3 3 --- --- 4/4 Undifferentiated/anaplastic IV, IV/IV, 4/4 4 Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is not always graded. When DCIS is graded, it is genearlly divided into three grades: low grade, intermediate grade, and high grade. Use the following table to convert DCIS grade in the SEER code. DCIS Grade Terminology SEER Code Grade I Low 1 Grade II Intermediate 2 Grade III High 3 -Kidney (C64.9) For kidney cancers, code the tumor grade using the following priority rules: 1) Fuhrman Grade; 2) Nuclear Grade; 3) Terminology (well diff, mod. diff); 4) Histologic Grade. These prioritization rules do not apply to Wilms tumor (M-8960). -Prostate (C61.9) For prostate cancers, code the tumor grade using the following priority order: 1) Gleason Score (this is the sum of the patterns, e.g., if the pattern is 2-4, the score is 6); 2) Terminology; 3) Histologic Grade; and 4) Nuclear Grade. Gleason's Pattern Prostate cancers are commonly graded using Gleason's score or pattern. Gleason's grading is based on a 5-component system, meaning it is based on 5 histologic patterns. The pathologist will evaluate the primary (majority) and secondary patterns for the tumor. The pattern is written as a range, with the majority pattern appearing first and the secondary pattern as the last number. Gleason's Score The patterns are added together to create a score. If the pathology report contains only one number, and that number is less than or equal to 5, it is a pattern. If the pathology report contains only one number, and that number is greater than 5, it is a score. If the pathology report specifies a specific number out of a total of 10, the first number given is the score. If there are two numbers other than 10, assume they refer to two patterns. The first number is the primary pattern and the second is the secondary pattern. Use the following table to convert Gleason's pattern or score into SEER codes: Gleason Conversion Table Code Gleason's Score (sum of primary and secondary patterns)Terminology Histologic Grade 1 2, 3, 4 Well differentiated I2 5, 6 Moderately differentiated II 3 7, 8, 9, 10 Poorly differentiated III -CNS Tumors \u00b7 Grade differentiated), Code 1; II (intermediate differentiation), Code 2; III (poorly differentiated), Code 3; IV (anaplastic), Code 4. \u00b7 Do not automatically code glioblastoma multiforme as Grade IV. If no grade is given, code 9 (unknown). \u00b7 For primary tumors of the brain and spinal cord (C71.0-C72.9) do not record the WHO grade in the field Grade/Differentiation; record the WHO grade in the data item CS Site-Specific Factor 1. \u00b7 All benign and borderline intracranial tumors should be coded grade 9.
