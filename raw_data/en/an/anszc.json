The genome sequence of a virus can reveal mutations that make it unique. Mutations are changes in a genome sequence (usually one-letter changes) and occur naturally over time. Collecting the genome sequences of virus specimens can reveal information about the relatedness of viruses and the similarities shared among groups of viruses. Groups of same-species viruses that share a set of genome mutations are referred to as a lineage. Scientists compare viral genomes to better understand virus transmission, how viruses can spread from person to person. Sequencing allows Public Health Ocials to monitor viruses involved in outbreaks, characterize outbreaks, detect clusters of cases and monitor new lineages. Novel mutations can emerge with new lineages and scientists refer to these new lineages as emerging variants. Some of these variants are classied by CDC as variants of concern and others as variants being monitored, because of their attributes, which can be for example: increased transmissibility, decreased neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, or increased severity of disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has extensive information about the variant classication (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-surveillance/variant-info.html), which is updated as new evidence becomes available. Sequencing can only be performed on samples that contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which means only samples used for molecular tests (such as PCR) can be included. For this reason, this report is limited to conrmed PCR-positives only. The genomes that are sequenced and compared are those of the virus, not humans. Sequencing can be performed on stored specimens at any time. For this reason, the dataset used for this report is dynamic and batches of stored specimens that are newly sequenced will be added to the dataset as sequencing occurs. Because of this, trends based on historical data can change over time. The State of Hawaii has conducted sequencing on approximately 8% of positive specimens that were detected sincethebeginningofthetesting, whichranksamongthebestinthenationaccordingtotheCentersforDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#published-covid-sequences). In February 2021, State Laboratories Division, Hawaii Department of Health increased sequencing eorts done on positive samples to improve the State's ability to detect new variants of concern and variants being monitored early. Since then, approximately 5-30% of samples PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 were sequenced (see below for details). 3Acknowledgements report genomes sequenced since Jan 1, 2021 by: Institution Program/partner Count Percent Laboratory Preparedness and Response Branch, State Laboratories Division4635 78.813% Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance (NS3)230 3.911% Quest Diagnostics Incorporated324 5.509% Laboratory of 290 4.931% Total 5881100.000% Table Notes: the samples sequenced by CDC in the NS3 program are collected, quality controlled and shipped to CDC by Laboratory Preparedness and Response Branch, State Laboratory Division, Hawaii Department of Health County distribution of genomes sequenced by State Laboratories Division since Jan 1st, 2021 Honolulu County Maui County Hawaii County Kauai County unknown Total 2701 636 812 209 277 4635 Table Notes: County information is currently unavailable for a number of samples that are sequenced by CDC and its commercial partners, as well as TAMC. 4Short summary LaboratoryPreparednessandResponseBranch(LPRB),StateLaboratoriesDivision, HawaiiDepartment of Health has sequenced an additional 560 viral genomes since the last variant report was generated (10/27/2021). CDC and its commercial partners have sequenced an additional 94 viral genomes from Hawaii since the last variant report was generated (10/27/2021). Tripler Army Medical center has sequenced an additional 80 viral genomes from Hawaii since the last variant report was generated (10/27/2021). The vast majority of the genomes sequenced (>99%) belong to the Delta variant. As a result of a decrease in the number of cases, a higher percentage of the positive samples have been sequenced (e.g. 20% for month of October) As the Delta variant remains the dominant variant circulating the globe, new sub-lineages of Delta, designated as AY.*, continue to emerge and be identied, including those previously designated as B.1.617.2. For this reason, the distribution of cases previously identied as B.1.617.2 may have changed to an AY.* designation since the last report. Furthermore, for simplicity, only AY.* sub-lineages with 10 or more genomes sequenced in the State of Hawaii will be outlined in the Tables below. Otherwise they will be included as Other AY.* under lineage. 5Signicance of variants of concern and variants being monitored It is important to note that evidence to date shows that vaccination leads to milder cases, not requiring hospitalization, for all the variants of concern and variants being monitored that are described here, even if the ecacy of antibodies is diminished against some of these variants compared to the original version of the virus. Also,noneof these variants are classied as a \"variant of high consequence\" , according to CDC variant categories (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html#Consequence), which is a category that would imply a variant has the ability to evade diagnosis, signicantly reduce the vaccines eectiveness and protection against severe disease, signicantly reduce susceptibility to treatments or lead to more severe disease and increased hospitalizations. Variants of concern (VOC) Delta variant (B.1.617.2 and AY.* sub-lineages) B.1.617.2 was rst identied in India and it is also known as variant 21A. WHO labeled it Delta on May 31, 2021. This variant contains the L452R mutation in the spike protein that is present in Epsilon variants, plus a few additional spike mutations predicted to have functional consequences (e.g. T478K). The Delta variant is highly contagious, more than 2x as contagious as previous variants. For more information about Delta, go to (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html). Variants being monitored (VBM) Alpha variant (B.1.1.7 and Q.* sub-lineages) B.1.1.7 was rst identied in the United Kingdom and it is also known as VOC202012/01 and 20I/501Y.V1. WHO labeled it \"Alpha\" on May 31, 2021. This variant contains the N501Y mutation and a short deletion in the Spike (S) protein. This variant is concerning because it has been shown to be signicantly more transmissible (~50%) than the original SARS-CoV-2 lineages and recent analyses from the United Kingdom suggest that B.1.1.7 cases are more likely to require hospitalization. B.1.1.7 does not appear to evade vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses. Gamma variant (P.1 and P.1.* sub-lineages) P.1 was rst identied in Brazil and it also known as variant 20J/501Y.V3. WHO labeled it \"Gamma\" on May 31, 2021. This variant also contains the N501Y mutation, like B.1.1.7 but not the deletion in the spike protein. Preliminary studies suggest that antibodies from previous infection or from vaccination may be less eective at preventing infection against this variant. Beta variant (B.1.351 and B.1.351.* sub-lineages) B.1.351 was rst identied in South Africa and it is also known as 20H/501Y.V2. WHO labeled it \"Beta\" on May 31, 2021. This variant is highly infectious and can quickly spread from person to person. Preliminary studies suggest that antibodies from previous infection or from vaccination may be less eective at preventing infection against this variant. 6Mu variant (B.1.621) Lineage B.1.621 was rst identied in Columbia in January 2021 and it has a couple of mutations that are common with the Beta (B.1.351) and Gamma( P.1) variants, which have been associated with high transmissibility (N501Y) and a level of vaccine eciency decrease (E484K). Iota variant (B.1.526) B.1.526 was rst identied in New York and is classied by CDC as a variant being monitored, because there are signs that it has increased transmissibility. WHO has labeled it \"Iota\" on May 31, 2021. Some of the samples (but not all) of this variant contain a mutation (E484K) that is also present in B.1.351 which can potentially make it less responsive to antibodies. Epsilon variant (B.1.429 and B.1.427) These closely related variants, B.1.429 and B.1.427, were rst identied in California and designated initially as CA VUI1. WHO labeled them \"Epsilon\" on May 31, 2021. They can quickly spread from person-to-person, with an estimated ~20% higher eciency than the original virus. CDC has deescalated \"Epsilon\" from a \"variant of concern\" to \"variant of interest\" on June 29, 2021, due to the signicant decrease in the proportion of B.1.429/B.1.427 lineage viruses circulating nationally and available data indicating that vaccines and treatments are eective against this variant. CDC has removed B.1.429 and B.1.427 from the \"variants if interest\" list in July 2021 due to declining prevalence and very few detections in recent months. Zeta variant (P.2) P.2 was rst identied in Brazil and is classied by CDC as a variant being monitored. It contains a mutation (E484K) that is also present in B.1.351 which can potentially make it less responsive to antibodies. This variant has been removed from the \"variant of interest\" list in July 2021 due to few detections in recent months. the total number of variants by lineage detected in the State of Hawaii in each 2-week interval ending on the date shown (date represents when the specimen was collected from a patient) Variants of concern are shown as orange/brown = Delta (lineages B.1.617.2 + AY.*) , Variants being monitored are shown as follows: dark blue = Alpha (lineages B.1.1.7 + Q.*), purple = Beta (lineage B.1.351), green = Gamma (lineages P.1 + P.1.*), pink = Epsilon (lineages B.1.429 and B.1.427) and Iota (lineage B.1.526) The gray bar graph (top) shows the percentage of PCR-test positive samples from each 2-week time interval that were sequenced. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing may not be a random sample of all cases. This graph does not estimate prevalence in the population. Sequencing can be performed on stored patient specimens at any time, so these numbers may change as additional specimens are sequenced. 8Estimate of proportion of variants circulating in viruses sequencedVariant Other Alpha Delta Gamma Beta Iota Epsilon Mu Figure Notes: The graph shows the estimate of biweekly percentages of the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the State of Hawaii, grouped in two-week intervals (based on the date of collection of samples). Not all positive SARS-CoV-2 specimens are sequenced and sequenced specimens are not a random selection of all COVID-19 cases in Hawaii. This graph has been generated only counting samples that were selected randomly for the purpose of surveillance, to avoid over-representing the samples that were selected for investigations of clusters. The last 2-week interval numbers will most likely change, as a number of samples that are currently being processed will be added. Sequencing of certain specimens can be delayed for technical reasons. For this reason, the dataset used for this report is dynamic and specimens that are newly sequenced will be added to the dataset as sequencing occurs. Because of this, trends based on historical data can change over time. 9Variants of concern in the State of Hawaii Variant Lineage Area of emergence Cumulative cases detectedEarliest specimen collection dateMost recent specimen collection date Delta 3573 AY.103 United States 749 21 May 2021 2021 States 487 Jun 08 Nov 2021 AY.3 United States 30728 Jun 2021 Nov 2021 States 01 India 26604 Jun 2021 08 2021 Oct States 8315 Jul 2021 29 Oct 2021 AY.118 United States 49 08 Jul 2021 13 Oct 2021 AY.119 United States 4906 Jul 2021 01 Nov 2021 AY.13 United States 36 09 Jun 2021 14 Sep 2021 AY.14 United States 3224 Jun 2021 23 Oct 2021 AY.47 United States 32 21 Jul 2021 01 Nov 2021 AY.2 United States 3101 Jun 2021 19 Aug 2021 AY.46.4 United States 31 21 Jun 2021 19 Oct United States/Europe2409 Jul 2021 18 Oct 2021 10Variants being monitored in the State of Hawaii Variant Lineage Area of emergence Cumulative cases detectedEarliest specimen collection dateMost recent specimen collection date Alpha 753 B.1.1.7 United Kingdom 703 21 Jan 2021 14 Aug 2021 Q.3 United States 4821 Mar 2021 Sep NA 2 Apr Apr 2021 Beta B.1.351 South Africa 1916 Feb 2021 22 Sep 2021 Gamma 185 P.1.10 United States 8124 Apr 2021 14 Jul 2021 P.1 Brazil 52 24 2021 21 Jul 2021 Mar Jul 59 07 Dec 2020 05 Jun 2021 Iota B.1.526 New York 12806 Feb 2021 Jul 2021 Mu B.1.621 Columbia 4303 Jun 2021 17 Sep 2021 B.1.621.1 United States 10 27 May 2021 11 Aug 2021 11Honolulu County the total number of variants detected in Honolulu County in each 2-week interval ending on the date shown - (date represents when the specimen was collected from a patient) Variants of concern are orange/brown = Delta (lineages B.1.617.2 + AY.*) , Variants being monitored are shown as follows: dark blue = Alpha (lineages B.1.1.7 + Q.*), purple = Beta (lineage B.1.351), green = Gamma (lineages P.1 + P.1.*), pink = Epsilon (lineages Iota (lineage B.1.526) SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing may not be a random sample of all cases.
