The brand was created by Dwayne Johnson (\"The Rock\"), along with his business partners, John Shulman, Dany Garcia and Dave Rienzi. The goal of ZOA Energy was to create a healthy, all-natural energy drink that would give consumers the boost they need without the negative side effects associated with many other energy drinks on the market. What differentiates ZOA Energy from other energy drinks is its unique blend of natural ingredients, including guarana, green tea and yerba mate, along with vitamins and electrolytes. This blend not only provides a quick boost of energy, but also supports overall health and wellness. Unlike many other energy drinks, ZOA Energy contains no artificial flavors, sugar, colors or preservatives, making it a healthier alternative for those looking to avoid these ingredients. Another unique aspect of ZOA Energy is its focus on supporting mental clarity and focus, in addition to physical energy. This is achieved through the inclusion of ingredients such as [Alpha-GPC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4595381/), a compound that supports cognitive function, and [L-theanine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18296328/), which promotes relaxation and mental alertness. This combination of physical and mental benefits sets ZOA Energy apart from many other energy drinks, which primarily focus on providing a quick energy boost.

The athlete-turned-actor said in a company [press release](https://zoaenergy.com/blogs/zoa-energy-news-blog/zoa-energy-expands-into-brick-and-mortar-stores-across-canada), \"Since launching this past fall in Canada, our ZOA brand has seen tremendous growth and most importantly, lots of satisfied consumers. We're excited to bring new flavors and our new design to our Canadian ZOA Warriors.\" The broader energy drink market is dominated by well-known brands such as Red Bull, Monster and Rockstar, which have all been around for decades; however, there has been a shift towards healthier options in recent years, as consumers become more conscious of the negative health effects associated with sugary, caffeinated beverages. Despite being a new brand, ZOA Energy has already made waves in the energy drink market and became the [official and exclusive energy drink](https://xflnewsroom.com/news/zoa-energy-named-official-and-exclusive-energy-drink-of-the-xfl/) of the XFL, a professional American football minor league, in 2022. ZOA Energy has also been recognized for its commitment to sustainability, with all of its packaging being recyclable and the company using sustainable sourcing practices for its ingredients. But ZOA Energy, despite having signed an [executive distribution deal](https://www.molsoncoorsblog.com/molson-coors-partners-team-including-dwayne-johnson-new-energy-drink-zoa) with Molson Coors in 2021, is still a small fish in a large pond. According to [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/energy-drinks-market), the global energy drink market was valued at $86.35 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.3 percent from 2022 to 2030. The market is dominated by Red Bull, Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., PepsiCo, Monster Energy, Lucozade, The Coca-Cola Company and AriZona Beverages, among others. While ZOA Energy is a new player in the energy drink market, it's focused on providing a healthier, all-natural alternative to traditional energy drinks. Its unique blend of natural ingredients, vitamins and electrolytes, along with its commitment to sustainability and mental clarity, sets it apart from many competitors on the market. And with the backing of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and his dedication to fitness and healthy living, ZOA Energy is likely to find success in the years to come. "}
