Though founded in the Presbyterian and Christian tradition, the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life welcomes all faith traditions and those who are seeking. The Office of Religious & Spiritual Life at Agnes Scott supports a community where anyone can expand their understanding through interfaith dialogue. We organize community worship, facilitate religious programs, and provide opportunities for study, learning, prayer, pastoral care and outreach. The Office of Religious & Spiritual Life supports students by: - Nurturing the spiritual growth of a diverse student body by providing opportunities for worship, service and dialogue. - Cultivating a welcoming community that promotes ecumenism, interfaith dialogue and respect for religious diversity. - Celebrating the relationship of faith and learning through an annual Faith and Learning event and other programs that bring eminent scholars and practitioners of religion to campus. - Valuing individual inquiry, commitment to the common good, the importance of character formation and engagement with the world. - Encouraging students' exploration of faith, spirituality, and vocation. Faith and Learning Lectures Open Religious Dialogue Each year, the College Committee on Faith and Learning sponsors a number of religious dialogue events that support the college's belief in academic freedom, pluralism, and diversity. The James Ross McCain Faith and Learning Lecture The committee's signature event is the annual James Ross McCain Faith and Learning Lecture. Named for James Ross McCain, Agnes Scott's second president (1923-1951), this event brings a nationally recognized scholar to campus for a keynote address. Focusing on current conversations about questions of faith and values in American culture, this lecture provides timely and relevant points of reference for on-campus religious dialogue. We welcome the local community and members of the general public to join us for these lectures. "}
