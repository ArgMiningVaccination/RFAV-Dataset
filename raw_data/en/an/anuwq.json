Applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review. Purpose The goal of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to stimulate research focused on understanding and addressing health disparities in surgical care and outcomes for patients who are from minority and other health disparity populations. The NIH-designated health disparity populations include minority racial and ethnic groups (Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders) as defined by the U.S. Census, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, population groups residing in rural medically underserved geographic areas, and sexual gender minorities. For the purpose of this initiative, investigations into minority health and health disparities in surgical care and outcomes include outcomes research, health services research, comparative effectiveness and clinical trial interventions in general surgical care and post-operative care, trauma and critical care, pre-operative care, emergency medicine care (e.g., access to emergency general surgery), obstetric and gynecologic care (like access to emergency cesarean section), orthopedic, cardiac and vascular (such as coronary artery bypass), gastrointestinal tract (such as colorectal, abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs), bariatric, pulmonary, organ transplantation, urologic and surgical oncology. Background Although breakthrough surgical research, technologies and instrumentation have advanced the field, the delivery of safe, and high-quality surgical care and outcomes have not benefited all patient groups. A substantial portion of surgical patients from health disparities populations still experience significant morbidity, prolonged hospitalization and chronic disability or premature death. Access to clinically indicated surgical care and optimal outcomes is affected by socioeconomic status, age, gender, level of education, race, ethnicity, health care resources and availability, and hospital region. Individual patient co-morbidity might be thought of as the most reliable surrogate for prediction of surgical outcome differences, however type of health insurance, access to best quality surgeons and hospitals, patient delay in agreeing to recommended surgery, referral patterns, facility or clinician volume and resources, access to technological advances in surgical approaches, suboptimal clinician-patient communication and unconscious biases are but a few additional mechanisms that can lead to disparities in access to safe and quality surgical care and optimal outcomes. Research suggests that as much as 11-30% of the global burden of disease requires surgical care - a figure that underscores the fundamental role of surgery as part of the essential health care. A recent report released by The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery reveals substantial growing trend in the global burden of disease that is amenable to surgical intervention. [http://www.thelancet.com/commissions/global-surgery](http://www.thelancet.com/commissions/global-surgery) According to the CDC, approximately 51 million inpatient surgical cases are performed in the U.S. each year (2010). Outpatient surgical cases outnumber inpatient cases at 53 million, and procedures in both settings, account for an appreciable share of the healthcare costs and resources. Health services research often fails to reflect the integral role of optimal access to safe surgical care and medical management as part of its goals. The structure and processes of care delivery dictate similar to non-surgical care, surgical outcomes. When suboptimal structure and processes are associated with patient characteristics, disparities in outcomes follow. Some mechanisms or factors contributing to surgical disparities include patient characteristics, clinical care and quality, variations in surgical practice and referral patterns, clinician factors, healthcare system-level factors and post-operative care and medical rehabilitation. Numerous patient characteristics have been identified as contributors to surgical disparities, including demographic (e.g. race), physiologic (e.g. immune status), limited English proficiency, health literacy and culture including beliefs, values and preferences. Compared to Whites, Blacks receive fewer reconstructions after mastectomy, arthritis-related knee and hip surgery and pulmonary resection for early stage lung cancers. Other factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) also impact these issues. Patients with low SES are less likely to receive specialized surgical services, including bariatric surgery, hepatocellular carcinoma resection and solid organ transplants regardless of age. Low SES patients who receive needed surgical care often have worse outcomes and higher morbidity and mortality than otherwise similar higher-income patients. Conversely, patients with higher income and more years of education are more likely to receive specialized surgical services and have better outcomes. In meta-analysis of studies analyzing odds of death after trauma, African American patients had higher odds of death compared to White patients. In other studies, analyzing surgical outcomes, certain racial and ethnic population groups were at significantly higher odds of experiencing surgical complications than others. African Americans had higher operative surgical morbidity and post-surgical mortality than Whites. Disparities in postoperative mortality based on SES have been consistently demonstrated after major surgery. The elderly (and especially those from socially disadvantaged groups - racial and ethnic, low SES) are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for surgically and potentially curable diseases such as abdominal aortic aneurysm repair or early-stage curable cancers. Likewise, female gender and especially those from racial and ethnic minority groups, is associated with decreased probability of undergoing certain potentially life-saving surgical procedures, including revascularization for severe coronary artery disease after acute myocardial infarction and curative intent surgery for cervical cancer. Racial and ethnic minorities with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, are less likely to receive counseling about renal transplantation, be waitlisted for transplant, and receive transplant. Even though some of the research shows that racial and ethnic minority patients are more likely than White patients to decline surgical procedures, overall differences in these rates tend to be generally low and patient refusals do not fully explain the persistent disparities in access to selected procedures and differential outcomes. Disparities in clinical care and quality are often dictated by procedural mechanisms such as adoption of evidence-based clinical guidelines, quality improvement strategies that also focus on addressing disparities such as patient-centeredness, shared decision-making, satisfaction and perceived quality of care. Clinical decision-making due to bias and stereotyping can also lead to disparate outcomes among patients. Simulated studies demonstrated the impact of implicit bias on the clinician's decision-making and require real-world clinical assessment. Surgical care and training have evolved as a result of carefully structured scientific investigations of evidence-based studies that have shown that many of the traditional approaches to surgical care, such as preoperative bowel clearance, the use of nasogastric tubes and drains placed in cavities, or use of slowly advanced diets are unnecessary or even harmful. Newer evidence-based practices have demonstrated that surgical recovery can be accelerated, recuperation decreased and co-morbidities minimized for all patient groups. An integrated approach focuses on enhancing recovery and reducing morbidity by implementing evidence in the fields of anesthesia, analgesia, reduction of surgical stress, fluid management, minimal invasive surgery, nutrition, and ambulation. The potential mechanisms by which system-level factors influence outcomes in surgical disparities have been documented in the literature. Structural variation (in resources and practice pattern) is thought to be responsible for a large proportion of between-hospital quality differences in surgical outcomes, such that racial/ethnic minority patients living in low SES zip codes may be more likely to present to hospitals with low structural quality and suffer worse outcomes. Process entails the acts of care delivery; these may vary significantly both between and within hospitals. Process variations, including choice of procedure, adherence to guidelines, and specialty referral, have all been linked to racial/ethnic minority patient status. While differences in the surgical outcomes associated with race and ethnicity have been well documented, less is known about other demographic associations, including immigration status, English language proficiency, health literacy, numeracy, rurality, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Research is needed to understand these demographic associations with clinical outcomes, to address and promote use of clinician and/or health professional- and patient-centered technologies, redesigned surgical care pathways and systems demonstrations, including enhanced tracking and incentive strategies to yield high-value, equitable surgical care. In addition, there are research gaps in implementation of multi-level intervention strategies (patient and clinician or patient and clinician and healthcare system). Research Objectives The goal of this FOA is to invite robust investigative and collaborative research focused on understanding and addressing disparities in surgical care and outcomes, including the factors that influence those disparities. Overarching priority research questions for the initiative include the testing of various hypotheses that originate from published or evidence-based surgical methods that identify new indications or approaches to improving access, care coordination, outcomes, safety and quality of surgical care for health disparity populations. While the goal is to better understand and explore effectiveness of potential intervention approaches for addressing surgical disparities, this initiative will also seek to identify strategies at the institutional and systems level. Projects should include a focus on one or more NIH-designated U.S. health disparity populations, which include Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities. Research Methodology Examples of research methods could include, but are not limited to: Multi-level interventions are of interest and encouraged. Potential Research Topics Projects are expected to use an approach that encompasses one or multiple themes (e.g., patient factors; systemic factors and access issues; clinical care and quality; provider/clinician factors; and post-operative care and rehabilitation factors) underlying determinants of disparities in surgical outcomes. Applications should be relevant to both the objectives of the funding opportunity announcement and to at least one of the participating Institute's research interests. Researchers are strongly encouraged to review the general research interests of the participating ICs.

For projects involving key biological and/or chemical resources, reviewers will comment on the brief plans proposed for identifying and ensuring the validity of those resources. Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s) convened by the Center for Scientific Review, in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11154), using the stated [review criteria](file:///C:/Users/mckenziene/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/13V4QPZR/Research%20Draft.doc#_1._Criteria). Assignment to a Scientific Review Group will be shown in the eRA Commons. Applications will be assigned on the basis of established PHS referral guidelines to the appropriate NIH Institute or Center. Applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications. Following initial peer review, recommended applications will receive a second level of review by the appropriate national Advisory Council or Board. The following will be considered in making funding decisions: Information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11156). A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the grantee's business official. Awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in [Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions](#_5._Funding_Restrictions). Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs. Any application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158) website. This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website. Additionally, ICs may specify any special reporting requirements for the proposed clinical trial to be included under IC-specific terms and conditions in the NoA. For example: If the proposed clinical trial has elevated risks, ICs may require closer programmatic monitoring and it may be necessary to require the awardee to provide more frequent information and data as a term of the award (e.g., to clarify issues, address and evaluate concerns, provide documentation). All additional communications and information related to programmatic monitoring must be documented and incorporated into the official project file. Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA. ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials by law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the \"responsible party\" must register and submit results information for certain \"applicable clinical trials\" on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website ( [https://register.clinicaltrials.gov](https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/)). NIH expects registration of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see [http://grants.nig.gov/ClinicalTrials_fdaaa/](https://grants.nih.gov/ClinicalTrials_fdaaa/). Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Grantee institutions must ensure that protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the awardee must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols. Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at [http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm) and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398). Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE). Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights law. This means that recipients of HHS funds must ensure equal access to their programs without regard to a person's race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, sex and religion. This includes ensuring your programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 \"Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.\" This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. HHS provides general guidance to recipients of FFA on meeting their legal obligation to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their programs by persons with limited English proficiency. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/special-topics/limited-english-proficiency/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/special-topics/limited-english-proficiency/index.html). The HHS Office for Civil Rights also provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/index.html) [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/laws-regulations-guidance/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/laws-regulations-guidance/index.html). Recipients of FFA also have specific legal obligations for serving qualified individuals with disabilities. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/disability/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/disability/index.html). Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html)or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697. Also note it is an HHS Departmental goal to ensure access to quality, culturally competent care, including long-term services and supports, for vulnerable populations. For further guidance on providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services, recipients should review the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care at [http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlid=53](http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlid=53). The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for awardees of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All awardees of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreementsare required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at [www.fsrs.gov](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170) on all subawards over $25,000. See the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11171) for additional information on this reporting requirement. In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 CFR 75.113 and Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM)about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings.Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 - Award Term and Conditions for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.
