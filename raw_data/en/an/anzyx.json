Our results reflect further good momentum across specialty medicines and vaccines, including the return to strong sales growth for Shingrix and continuin g pipeline progress.

Press release Q1 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 April 2022 , 9,780 32 32 Total operating profit 2,801 65 65 Total earnings per share 35.9p 67 66 Adjusted operating profit 2,613 39 39 Adjusted earnings per share 32.8p 43 43 Cash generated from operations 2,755 >100 Free cash flow 1,650 >100 2022 guidance We reconfirm our guidance for new GSK in 2022, as set out below. This guidance is provided at CER and excludes the commercial benefit of COVID -19 solutions. In 2022 , we expect to continue to deliver on our strategic priorities. We plan to increase targeted investment in R&D, to build on and invest behind our top -line momentum for key growth drivers and to deliver the demerger of our Consumer Healthcare business in July 2022 . Assuming global economies and healthcare systems approach normality as the year progresses, we expect sales of Specialty Medicines to grow approximately 10% CER and sales of General Me dicines to show a slight decrease, primarily reflecting increased genericisation of established Respiratory medicines. Vaccines sales are expected to grow at a low -teens percentage at CER for the year. However, as noted at the time of announcing full -year 2021 results, we anticipated governments' prioritisation of COVID -19 vaccination programmes and ongoing measures to contain the pandemic would result in some continued disruption to adult immunisations. In the first -quarter 2022 Shingrix demonstrated stron g demand recovery, particularly in the US, as well as channel inventory build and the benefit of a favourable comparator to Q1 2021. Despite the potential for short -term pandemic disruption, we continue to expect strong double -digit growth and record annua l sales for Shingrix in 2022 based on strong demand in existing markets and continued geographical expansion. Reflecting these factors and our first -quarter 2022 results, we reconfirm our full -year 2022 guidance for new GSK of sales growth between 5% to 7 % CER and Adjusted operating profit growth between 12% to 14% CER compared to 2021. The guidance includes the future benefit in royalty income from the settlement and license agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) announced on 1 February 2022. Medi um term outlooks were provided for Consumer Healthcare at a Capital Markets Day on 28 February 2022. Until such time as the formal criteria for treating Consumer Healthcare as a 'Discontinued operation' have been satisfied (currently expected in Q2 2022), GSK will continue to present the Consumer Healthcare business within 'Continuing operations' and will consolidate the business for reporting purposes until the demerger has completed. Dividend policies and expected pay -out ratios are unchanged for new GSK and new Consumer Healthcare (subject to new Consumer Healthcare board approval). The future dividend policies and guidance in relation to the expected dividend pay-out in 2022 across both new GSK and new Consumer Healthcare are provided on page 19. 2022 COVID -19 solutions expectations In 2022, based on known binding agreements with governments, we expect that COVID -19 solutions will contribute a similar sales level to 2021, but at a s ubstantially reduced profit contribution due to the increased proportion of lower margin Xevudy sales. We expect this to reduce the new GSK Adjusted Operating profit growth (including COVID -19 solutions in both years) by between 5% to 7%. The overwhelming majority of expected COVID -19 solutions sales were achieved in the first quarter this year. In April 2022, the US FDA updated Xevudy 's authorisation to reflect the increase in COVID -19 cases caused by the Omicron BA.2 sub -variant and as a result, Xevudy is no longer authorised to treat COVID -19 in any US region. However, we will continue to discuss future opportunities to support governments, healthcare systems, and patients whereby our COVID -19 solutions can address the emergence of any new COVID -19 variant of concern. All expectations, guidance and targets regarding future performance and dividend payments should be read together with 'Guidance , assumptions and cautionary statements' on pag e 43.

Sales grew 15% AER, 16% CER, excluding the impact of brands divested, which were entirely in the Digestive health and other category. Overall, the business delivered strong growth across all categories. Sales benefited from favourable prior year comparators especially in Re spiratory health which saw a strong rebound following the historically low cold and flu season in Q1 2021, with cold and flu sales contributing approximately five percentage points to total growth. In addition, advance retailer and wholesaler stock -in, and initial distributor sell -in due to the systems cutover and distribution business model change ahead of the demerger contributed approximately two percentage points to total growth. Strong sales growth in Pain relief benefited from increased demand durin g the Omicron wave and an improved capacity in Vitamins, minerals and supplements. Oral health Oral health sales grew 6% AER, 9% CER to \u00a3740 million. Sensodyne delivered high -single digit growth reflecting underlying brand strength, continued innovation and strong growth across key markets including the US, India, Japan, Middle East and Africa. Paradontax delivered low double -digit growth. Denture care grew low -teens percent following the decrease of sales during the pandemic. Pain relief Pain relief sales increased 17% AER, 17% CER to \u00a3639 million. Panadol grew mid thirties percent due to a successful campaign aimed at post vaccination use and increased demand during the Omicr on wave. Advil grew low thirties percent benefitting from retail stocking patterns in the US versus a decrease in Q1 2021. Excedrin grew high-single digits and Voltaren was stable with growth in China offset by a decrease in Germany. Vitamins, minerals a nd supplements Vitamins, minerals and supplements sales increased 17% AER, 15% CER to \u00a3407 million. Centrum grew high -teens percent, with particularly strong growth in China due to consumer focus on immunity as a result of the pandemic. Emergen -C grew high thirties percent versus a high twenties percent decrease in Q1 2021. Caltrate decreased low single digits , high single digit growth in China was insufficient to offset a decline in the US and South East Asia . Respiratory health Respiratory heal th sales increased 51% AER, 53% CER to \u00a3370 million. The category rebounded strongly from the historically low demand for cold and flu products in Q1 2021. Cold and flu product sales growth doubled in the US and was strong in Europe, Middle East and Afric a and Latin America, with sales ahead of pre -pandemic levels in 2019. Digestive health and other Digestive health and other brands were flat AER, down 1% CER to \u00a3477 million. Sales grew 5% AER, 4% CER excluding the impact of brands divested. Digestive health increased high -single digits with strong growth in Tums and Eno partially offset by a low -single digit decrease in Nexium. Smokers health also grew hi gh-single digits and Skin health grew low single -digits. By Region International and US sales grew high -teens percent on a CER basis with broad growth across categories. European growth was driven by a particularly strong rebound of cold and flu product sales ahead of pre -pandemic sales in 2019. Press release Q1 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 April 2022 , London, U.K . 12 Operating performance Cost of sales Total cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 37.7%, 4.3 percentage points higher at AER and 4.2 percentage points higher in CER terms than Q1 2021. This included lower write -downs on sites from major restructuring programmes compared to 2021. Excluding these and other Adjusting items, Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 35.5%, 5.3 percentage points higher at AER and at CER compared with Q1 2021. This primarily reflected higher pandemic sales ( Xevudy ) increasing cost of sales margin by seven percentage points as well as the impact of increased commodity prices and freight costs particularly in Consumer Healthcare . This wa s partially offset by a favourable mix primarily from increase d sales of Shingrix in the US and Europe as well as a one-time benefit from inventory adjustments in the quarter. Selling, general and administration Total SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 29.1%, 3.6 percentage points lower at AER and 3.5 percentage points lower at CER than in Q1 2021 as the growth in sales outweighed SG&A expenditure growth. Adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 27.4%, 3.8 percentage points lower at AER than in Q1 2021 and 3.6 percentage points lower at CER. Adjusted SG&A costs increased 16% AER, 17% CER which primarily reflected an increased level of launch investment in Specialty Medicines particularly HIV, Vaccines and increased Consumer Healthcare brand investment to a more normal level compared to challenging conditions in Q1 2021. The growth in Adjusted SG&A also reflected an unfavourable comparison to a beneficial legal settlement in 2021 , exchange losses on collaboration profit share and impairment provisions relating to Russia and Ukraine. This growth, however was partly offset by the continuing benefit of restructuring and tight control of ongoing costs . Research and development Group R&D expenditure was \u00a31,167 million (11.9% of turnover), up 4% at both AER and CER. Adjusted R&D expenditure was \u00a31,154 million (11.8% of turnover ), 7% higher than Q1 2021 at both AER and CER . Adjusted R&D expenditure excluding Consumer Healthcare was \u00a3 1,088 million ( 15.2% of turnover ), 6% higher at AER, 6% higher at CER, primarily driven by increases in the Vaccines portfolio . Specialty Medicines investment decreased with reductions in the late -stage Specialty Medicines portfolio partly offset by increase d research i nvestment . In the Vaccines portfolio there has been increased investment in RSV for older adults and meningitis due to the ongoing phase III trials which commenced in 2021 and in Shingrix due to the combination trial exploring the co-administration of Shingrix /Flu/COVID -19 as well as further market expansion. There has also been a significant increase in the level of mRNA investment . In Specialty Medicines investment continues in Blenrep, Zejula and otilimab but decreased primarily following termination of the Oncology assets bintrafusp alpha and fel adilimab in 2021 and following the regulatory submission of daprodustat during Q1 2022. GSK continue s to see increased investment in Specialty Medicines due to several early -stage assets progressing to phase I. Consumer Healthcare adjusted R&D spen d was \u00a366 million in the quarter . Royalty income Royalty income was \u00a3139 million (Q1 2021: \u00a391 million), up 53% AER, 53% CER, primarily reflecting higher sales of Gardasil and royalty income from Gilead under the settlement and licensing agreement with Gilead announced on 1 February 2022 (see page 21). Other operating income/(expense) Net other operating income was \u00a3583 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3 209 million) including \u00a3924 million upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead . This was partly offset by accounting charges of \u00a3 335 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3 107 million) arising from the re -measurement of contingent consideration liabilities and the liabilities for the Pfizer put option and Pfizer and Shionogi preferential dividends in ViiV Healthcare . This included a re -measurement charge of \u00a3 256 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3 134 million) for the contingent consideration liability due to Shionogi & Co. Limited (Shi onogi), including the unwinding of the discount for \u00a3 101 million and a charge for \u00a3 155 million primarily from changes to exchange rates as well as adjus tments to sales forecasts. Press release Q1 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 April 2022 , London, U.K . 13 Operating profit Total operating profit was \u00a3 2,801 million compared with \u00a3 1,693 million in Q1 2021. This included the \u00a3924 million upfront settlement income from Gilead as well as increased profits on turnover growth of 32% at CER, partly offset by higher remeasurement charges for contingent consideration liabilities and lower profits on disposals. Adjusted operating profit was \u00a32,613 million, 39% higher than Q1 2021 at AER and at CER on a turnover increase of 32% CER. The Adjusted operating margin of 26.7% was 1.4 percentage points higher at AER and 1.3 percentage points higher at CER than in Q1 2021. This primarily reflected sales growth of 32% CER which was significantly higher than growth in SG&A and R&D with continued tight cost control and restructuring benefits . The benefit from COVID -19 solutions sales ( Xevudy ) contributed approximately 11% AER, 11% CER to Adjusted Operating profit growth. Excluding Consumer Healthcare, Adjusted operating profit was \u00a31,963 million, 46% higher than Q1 2021 at AER and 44% at CER and the Adjusted operating margin was 27.5% which was 1.1 percentage points higher at AER and 0.8 percentage points higher at CER than in Q1 2021. This primarily reflected the benefit from COVID -19 solutions sales ( Xevudy ), which contributed approximately 16% AER, 15% CER to Adjusted operating profit growth and reduced the Adjusted operating margin by approximately 2.6 percentage points at AER and 2.5 percentage points at CE R. Adjusted operating profit growth also includes leverage from strong sales growth with margin improvement from sales mix, primarily Shingrix . Contingent consideration cash payments made to Shionogi and other companies reduce the balance sheet liability and hence are not recorded in the income statement. Total contingent consideration cash payments in Q1 2022 amounted to \u00a3 211 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3 221 million ). These included cash to Shionogi of \u00a3208 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3 216 million). Adjusted operating profit by business Commercial Operations operating profit was \u00a3 3,121 million, up 27% AER and CER on a turnover increase of 40% CER. The operating margin of 43.7% was 4.3 percentage points lower at both AER and CER than in Q1 2021. This primarily reflected strong sales of lower margin Xevudy in the quarter, i ncreased investment behind launches in Specialty Medicines including HIV and Vaccines plus higher commodity, freight and distribution costs as well as an adverse comparison to a favourable legal settlement in Q1 2021 . This was partly offset by c ontinued tight control of ongoing costs , benefits from continued restructuring and i ncreased royalty income from Gardasil sales and , following the settlement with Gilead in February 2022 , Biktarvy sales . R&D segment operating expenses were \u00a3 1,095 million, up 6% AER, 6% CER, primarily driven by increased investment in Vaccines including priority investments for RSV Older Adult, MenABCWY and mRNA . Consumer Healthcare operating profit was \u00a3 650 million, up 21% AER, 26% CER on a turnover increase of 14% CER. The operating margin of 24.7% was 1.5 percentage points higher at AER and 2.3 percentage points higher on a CER basis than in Q1 2021. This reflected strong leverage from volume growth and price increases , supply chain efficiencies and incremental sy nergy benefits from the Pfizer Joint Venture partially offset by increased brand investment, increased commodity and freight costs as well as new costs in 2022 associated with starting to run Consumer Health care as a standalone company. Net finance costs Total net finance costs were \u00a3 202 million compared with \u00a3 191 million in Q1 2021. Adjusted n et finance costs were \u00a3 202 million compared with \u00a3 190 million in Q1 2021. The increase primarily reflect ed higher interest expense on debt due to adverse movements i n exchange rates and the newly issued Consumer Healthcare bond debt . Share of after tax profits of associates and joint ventures The share of after tax loss of associates and joint ventures was \u00a3 1 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3 16 million profit ). Press release Q1 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 April 2022 , London, U.K . 14 Taxation The charge of \u00a3 431 million represented an effective tax rate on Total results of 16.6% (Q1 202 1: 17.0%) and reflected the different tax effects of the various Adjusting items. Tax on Adjusted profit amounted to \u00a3 431 million and represented an effe ctive Adjusted tax rate of 17.9% (Q1 2021: 18.6%). Issues related to taxation are described in Note 14, 'Taxation' in the Annual Report 2021. The Group continues to believe it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods that are open and not yet agreed by relevant tax authorities. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities . Non-controlling interests The allocation of Total earnings to non -controlling interests amounted to \u00a3 365 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3 187 million). The increase was primarily due to an increased allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3 227 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3 76 million), including the Gilead upfront set tlement income partly offset by increased credits for re-measurement of contingent consideration liabilities. The allocation of Adjusted earnings to non -controlling interests amounted to \u00a3 333 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3246 million). The increase in allocation primarily reflected a n increase in allocation of Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture profits of \u00a3154 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3 114 million) and an increase allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3 113 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3 108 million), as well as higher net profits in some of the Group's other entities with non -controlling interests. Earnings per share Total EPS was 35.9p compared with 21.5p in Q1 2021. This primarily reflected leverage from significant sales growth during the quarter and income of \u00a3924 million from the settlement with Gilead partly offset by an increase in finance costs . Adjusted EPS was 32.8p compared with 22.9p in Q1 2021, up 43 % AER 43% CER, on a 39% CER increase in Adjusted operating profit primarily reflect ing increased sales of Specialty Medicines and Vaccines including COVID -19 solutions sales, tight cost control and a lower effective tax rate . These were partly offset by higher supply chain costs, increased R&D investment , favourable legal settlements in Q1 2021 and higher interest costs . The contribution to growth from COVID -19 solutions was approximately 15% AER, 15% CER . Currency impact on Q1 2022 results The results for Q1 2022 are based on ave rage exchange rates, principally \u00a31/$ 1.34, \u00a31/\u20ac1.19 and \u00a31/Yen 156. Comparative exchange rates are given on page 31. The period -end exchange rates were \u00a31/$ 1.31, \u00a31/\u20ac1.18 and \u00a31/Yen 160. In Q1 2022, turnover was up 32% AER and CER. Total EPS was 35.9p compared with 21.5p in Q1 2021. Adjusted EPS was 32.8p compared with 22.9p in Q1 2021, up 43 % at both AER and CER . The currency impact was largely neutral reflect ing the strengthening in Sterling against the Euro and Japanese Yen o ffset by the weakening of Sterling against the US Dollar. Exchange gains or losses on the settlement of intercompany transactions had a one percent favourable impact on the neutral currency impact on Adjusted EPS.

The Group initiated in Q1 2020 a two -year Separation Preparation programme to prepare for the separation of GSK into two companies: new GSK, a biopharma company with an R&D approach focused on science related to the immune system, the use of human genetics and new technologies, and a new leader in Consumer Healthcare. The programme aims to: Drive a common approach to R&D with improved capital allocation Align and improve the capabilities and efficiency of global support functions to support new GSK Further optimise the supply chain and product portfolio, including the divestment of non -core assets Prepare Consumer Healthcare to operate as a standalone company The programme continues to target delivery of \u00a3 0.8 billion of annual savings by 2022 and \u00a3 1.0 billion by 2023, with total costs estimated at \u00a3 2.4 billion, of which \u00a3 1.6 billion is expected to be cash costs. The proceeds of divestments have largely covered the cash costs of the programme. Press release Q1 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 April 2022 , London, U.K . 17 The completi on of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture with Pfizer has realised substantial cost synergies and largely delivered the expected total annual cost savings of \u00a30.5 billion by 2021. In February 2022, a t the Haleon C apital Markets Day , the projected savings from this program me were announced as increased by \u00a30.1 billion to \u00a30.6 billion by 2022 . The cash costs are expected to be \u00a30.7 billion and non -cash charges are expected to be \u00a30.1 billion, plus an additional capital expenditure of \u00a30.2 billion. Up to 25 % of the cost savings are intended to be reinvested in the business to support innovation and other growth opportunities. Transaction -related adjustments Transaction -related adjustments resulted in a net charge of \u00a3 347 million ( Q1 2021: \u00a3116 million). This included a net \u00a3 332 million accounting charge for the re -measurement of contingent consideration liabilities and the liabilities for the P fizer put option and Pfizer and Shionogi preferential -ViiV Healthcare joint Venture (including Shionogi preferential dividends) 256 134 ViiV Healthcare put options and Pfizer preferential dividends 32 (53) Contingent consideration on former Novartis Vaccines business 44 26 Other adjustments 15 9 Total transaction -related charges 347 116 The \u00a3 256 million charge relating to the contingent consideration for the former Shionogi -ViiV Healthcare joint venture represented an increase in the valuation of the contingent consideration due to Shionogi, as a result of the unwind of the discount for \u00a3 101 million and a charge of \u00a3 155 million primarily from exchange rates as well as adjustments to sales forecasts. The \u00a3 32 million charge relating to the ViiV Healthcare put option and Pfizer preferential dividends represented an increase in the valuation of the p ut option primarily as a result of updated exchange rates and adjustments to sales forecasts . The ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability is fair valued under IFRS. An explanation of the accounting for the non -controlling interests in ViiV Heal thcare is set out on page 21. Divestments, significant legal charges , and other items Divestments , significant legal charges and other items primarily included the \u00a3924 million upfront settlement income received from Gilead, as well as gains from a number of asset disposals, fair value gains on investments and certain other Adjusting items . Separation costs From Q2 2020, the Group started to report additional costs to prepare for establishment of the Consumer Healthcare business as an independent entity (\"Separation costs\"). Total separation costs incurred in Q1 2022 were \u00a3 139 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3 35 million). This includes \u00a322 million relating to transaction costs incurred in connection with the demerger and preparatory admission costs related to the listing of Consumer Healthcare .

Q1 2022 Cash generated from operating activities for the quarter was \u00a32,755 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3486 million). The increase primarily reflected a significant increase in operating profit including the upfront income from the settlement with Gilead, favourable timing of collections and profit share payments for Xevudy sales and a lower seasonal increase in inventory. Total cash payments to Shionogi in relation to the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability in the quarter were \u00a3208 million (Q1 2021: \u00a3216 mi llion), of which \u00a3183 million was recognised in cash flows from operating activities and \u00a325 million was recognised in contingent consideration paid within investing cash flows. These payments are deductible for tax purposes. Free cash inflow was \u00a31,650 million for the quarter (Q1 2021: \u00a33 million outflow). The increase primarily reflected the significant increase in operating profit including the upfront income from the settlement with Gilead, favourable timing of collections and profit share payments fo r Xevudy sales and lower seasonal increase in inventory. This was partially offset by lower proceeds from disposals and higher purchases of intangible asset, as well as higher tax payments and capital expenditure. Net debt At 31 March 2022, net debt wa s \u00a319.4 billion, compared with \u00a319.8 billion at 31 December 2021, comprising gross debt of \u00a333.3 billion which increased primarily due to the debt issuance for Consumer Healthcare, cash and liquid investments of \u00a311.0 billion and cash advances and a short -term loan to a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. of \u00a32.9 billion, reflecting an on -lend of a portion of the cash received from the proceeds of the Consumer Healthcare bond issuance in line with Pfizer's shareholding of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture. Net debt reduced due to \u00a31.7 billion free cash flow partly offset by the dividends paid to shareholders of \u00a31.0 billion, \u00a30.2 billion of net adverse exchange impacts from the translation of non -Sterling denominated debt and exchange on other financing items a nd additional investments of \u00a30.1 billion. At 31 March 2022, GSK had short -term borrowings (including overdrafts and lease liabilities) repayable within 12 months of \u00a3 4.1 billion with loans of \u00a3 3.9 billion repayable in the subsequent year.

As set out at the new GSK Investor Update in June 2021 , from 2022 GSK will adopt a progressive divi dend policy targeting a dividend pay -out ratio equivalent to 40 to 60% over the investment cycle. The dividend policy, the total expected cash distribution, and the respective dividend pay -out ratios for new GSK and new Consumer Healthcare remain unchanged . GSK expects to declare a 27p per share dividend payable by the current group for the first half. This comprises 22p per share for new GSK and 5p per share representing Consumer Healthcare during the first half whilst part of the group. For the second half of 2022, new GSK continues to expect to declare a 22p per share dividend. As previously communicated, new GSK would expect to declare a dividend of 45p per share for 2023. Following separation, the dividend policy for the new Consumer Healthcare company will be the responsibility of its Board of Directors and is expected to be guided by a 30 to 50 per cent pay -out ratio. We expect a second -half dividend from the new Consumer Healthcare company equivalent to a pay -out of around 3p per share, subject to its Board's decisions on the intra -year phasing of dividend payments. In aggregate, this would represent on the full year 2022 basis the equivalent of a Group dividend of aro und 52p per share. Dividends payable by Consumer Healthcare will only be receivable by shareholders who remain invested in Consumer Healthcare post -separation and at the appropriate record dates. Payment of dividends The equivalent interim dividend receivable by ADR holders will be calculated based on the exchange rate on 29 June 2022. An annual fee of $0.03 per ADS (or $0.0075 per ADS per quarter) is charged by the Depositary. The ex -dividend date will be 19 May 202 2, with a record date of 20 May 2022 and a payment date of 1 July 2022.

Press release Q1 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 April 2022 , London, U.K . 20 Total and Adjusted results Total reported results represent the Group's overall performance. GSK also uses a number of adjusted, non -IFRS, measures to report the performance of its business. Adjusted results and other non -IFRS measures may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted results are defined below and other non -IFRS measures are defined on page 42. GSK believes that Adjusted results, when considered together with Total results, provide investors, analysts and other stakeholders with helpful complementa ry information to understand better the financial performance and position of the Group from period to period, and allow the Group's performance to be more easily compared against the majority of its peer companies. These measures are also used by manageme nt for planning and reporting purposes. They may not be directly comparable with similarly described measures used by other companies. GSK encourages investors and analysts not to rely on any single financial measure but to review GSK's quarterly results announcements, including the financial statements and notes, in their entirety. GSK is committed to continuously improving its financial reporting, in line with evolving regulatory requirements and best practice. In line with this practice, GSK expects to continue to review and refine its reporting framework. Adjusted results exclude the following items from Total results, together with the tax effects of all of these items: amortisation of intangible assets (excluding computer software and capitalised development costs) impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) and goodwill Major restructuring costs, which include impairments of tangible assets and computer software, (under specific Board approved programmes th at are structural, of a significant scale and where the costs of individual or related projects exceed \u00a325 million), including integration costs following material acquisitions transaction -related accounting or other adjustments related to significant a cquisitions proceeds and costs of disposal of associates, products and businesses; significant settlement income; significant legal charges (net of insurance recoveries) and expenses on the settlement of litigation and government investigations; other operating income other than royalty income, and other items separation costs include costs to establish Consumer Healthcare as an independent business, as well as admission listing and demerger costs Costs for all other ordinary course smaller scale restructuring and legal charges and expenses are retained within both Total and Adjusted results. As Adjusted results include the benefits of Major restructuring programmes but exclude significant costs (such as significant legal, major restructuring and transaction items) they should not be regarded as a complete p icture of the Group's financial performance, which is presented in Total results. The exclusion of other Adjusting items may result in Adjusted earnings being materially higher or lower than Total earnings. In particular, when significant impairments, res tructuring charges and legal costs are excluded, Adjusted earnings will be higher than Total earnings. GSK has undertaken a number of Major restructuring programmes in response to significant changes in the Group's trading environment or overall strategy, or following material acquisitions. Within the Pharmaceuticals sector, the highly regulated manufacturing operations and supply chains and long lifecycle of the business mean that restructuring programmes, particularly those that involve the rationalisati on or closure of manufacturing or R&D sites are likely to take several years to complete . Costs, both cash and non -cash, of these programmes are provided for as individual elements are approved and meet the accounting recognition criteria. As a result, cha rges may be incurred over a number of years following the initiation of a Major restructuring programme. Significant legal charges and expenses are those arising from the settlement of litigation or government investigations that are not in the normal cou rse and materially larger than more regularly occurring individual matters. They also include certain major legacy matters. Press release Q1 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 April 2022 , London, U.K . 21 Reconciliations between Total and Adjusted results, providing further information on the key Adjusting items, are set out on page 15. GSK provides earnings guidance to the investor community on the basis of Adjusted results. This is in line with peer companies and expectations of the investor community, supporting easier comparison of the Group's performance with its peers. GSK is no t able to give guidance for Total results as it cannot reliably forecast certain material elements of the Total results, particularly the future fair value movements on contingent consideration and put options that can and have given rise to significant ad justments driven by external factors such as currency and other movements in capital markets. ViiV Healthcare ViiV Healthcare is a subsidiary of the Group and 100% of its operating results (turnover, operating profit, profit after tax) are included within the Group income statement. Earnings are allocated to the three shareholders of ViiV Healthcare on the basi s of their respective equity shareholdings (GSK 78.3%, Pfizer 11.7% and Shionogi 10%) and their entitlement to preferential dividends, which are determined by the performance of certain products that each shareholder contributed. As the relative performanc e of these products changes over time, the proportion of the overall earnings allocated to each shareholder also changes. In particular, the increasing proportion of sales of dolutegravir and cabotegravir - containing products has a favourable impact on the proportion of the preferential dividends that is allocated to GSK. Adjusting items are allocated to shareholders based on their equity interests. GSK was entitled to approximately 86% of the Total earnings and 83% of the Adjusted earnings of ViiV Healt hcare for 202 1. As consideration for the acquisition of Shionogi's interest in the former Shionogi -ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012, Shionogi received the 10% equity stake in ViiV Healthcare and ViiV Healthcare also agreed to pay additional future ca sh consideration to Shionogi, contingent on the future sales performance of the products being developed by that joint venture, dolutegravir and cabotegravir . Under IFRS 3 'Business combinations', GSK was required to provide for the estimated fair value of this contingent consideration at the time of acquisition and is required to update the liability to the latest estimate of fair value at each subsequent period end. The liability for the contingent consideration recognised in the balance sheet at the date of acquisition was \u00a3659 million. Subsequent re -measurements are reflected within other operating income/(expense) and within Adjusting items in the income statement in each period. On 1 February 2022, ViiV Healthcare reached agreement with Gilead to set tle the global patent infringement litigation relating to the commercialisation of Gilead's Biktarvy. Under the terms of the global settlement and licensing agreement, Gilead made an upfront payment of $1.25 billion to ViiV Healthcare in February 2022. In addition, Gilead will also pay a 3% royalty on all future US sales of Biktarvy and in respect of the bictegravir component of any other future bictegravir -containing products sold in the US. These royalties will be payable by Gilead to ViiV Healthcare fro m 1 February 2022 until the expiry of ViiV Healthcare's US Patent No. 8,129,385 on 5 October 2027. Gilead's obligation to pay royalties does not extend into any period of regulatory paediatric exclusivity, if awarded . Cash payments to settle the continge nt consideration are made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare each quarter, based on the actual sales performance and other income of the relevant products in the previous quarter. These payments reduce the balance sheet liability and hence are not recorded in the income statement. The cash payments made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare in Q1 2022 were \u00a3208 million. As the liability is required to be recorded at the fair value of estimated future payments, there is a significant timing difference between the charges that are recorded in the Total income statement to reflect movements in the fair value of the liability and the actual cash payments made to settle the liability. Further explanation of the acquisition -related arrangements with ViiV Healthcare are set out on pages 57 and 58 of the Annual Report 2021 .

GSK has revised its operating segments from Q1 2022. Previously, GSK reported results und er four segments: Pharmaceuticals; Pharmaceuticals R&D; Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare. From the first quarter 2022, GSK reports results under three segments: Commercial Operations ; Total R&D and Consumer Healthcare, and members of the GLT are responsible for each segment. Comparative information in this announcement has been retrospectively restated on a consistent basis . R&D investment is essential for the sustainability of the business. How ever for segment reporting the Commercial operating profits exclude allocations of globally funded R&D . The Total R&D segment is the responsibility of the Chief Scientific Officer and President, R&D and is reported as a separate segment. The operating pr ofit of this segment includes R&D activities across Specialty Medicines , including HIV and Vaccines . It includes R&D and some SG&A costs relating to regulatory and other functio ns. The Group's management reporting process allocates intra -Group profit on a product sale to the market in which that sale is recorded, and the profit analyses below have been presented on that basis.

At 31 March 2022, the Group's aggregate provision for legal and other disputes (not including tax matters described on page 14) was \u00a30.2 billion (31 December 2021: \u00a30.2 billion). The Group may become involved in significant l egal proceedings in respect of which it is not possible to meaningfully assess whether the outcome will result in a probable outflow, or to quantify or reliably estimate the liability, if any, that could result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. In these cases, the Group would provide appropriate disclosures about such cases, but no provision would be made. The ultimate liability for legal claims may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, inves tigations and possible settlement negotiations. The Group's position could change over time, and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed by a material amount the amount of the provisions reported in the Group's financial accounts. Significant developments since the date of the Annual Report 2021 are as follows: Dovato In September 2019, ViiV Healthcare received a paragraph IV letter from Cipla Ltd. (Cipla) relating to Dovato and challenging only the crystal form patent. On 4 November 2019, ViiV Healthcare filed suit against Cipla in the US District Court for the District of Delaware. In March 2022, the parties reached a settlement, thereby concluding the matter. Juluca In January 2020, ViiV Healthcare received a paragraph IV letter from Lupin Ltd. (Lupin) relating to Juluca and challenging the crystal form patent as well as a patent relating to the combination of dolutegravir and rilpivirine that expires on 24 January 20 31. On 28 February 2020, ViiV Healthcare filed suit against Lupin on both patents. In March 2022, the parties reached a settlement, thereby concluding the matter.

COVID -19 pandemic The potential impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on GSK's trading performance and all its principal risks ha ve been assessed , with appropriate mitigation plans put in place. GSK is encouraged by the uptake in demand in the first quarter for its medicines and vaccines, particularly Shingrix . Overall, the Company remains confident in the underlying demand for its medicines and v accines . GSK is encouraged by the rate at which CO VID-19 vaccinations and boosters have been administered worldwide , providing support for healthcare systems ahead of the anticipated return to normal. This continues , however, to be a dynamic situation with the risk of future variants of concern unknown; t hese variants of concern could potentially impact GSK's trading results, clinical trials, supply continuity, and its employees materially . Exchange rates GSK operate s in many countries, and earns revenues and incurs costs in many currencies. The results of the Group, as reported in Sterling, are affected by movements in exchange rates between Sterling and other currencies. Average exchange rates, as modified by specific transaction rates for large transactions, prev ailing during the period , are used to translate the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures into Sterling. Period -end rates are used to translate the net assets of those entities. The currencies which most influenced these translations and the relevant exchange rates were : Q1 2022 Q1 2021 2021 Average 1.16 Yen/\u00a3 156 146 151 Period -end rates: US$/\u00a3 1.31 1.38 1.35 Euro/\u00a3 1.18 1.17 1.19 Yen/\u00a3 160 152 155 During Q 1 2022 average Sterling exchange rates were stronger against the Yen and the Euro but weaker against the US Dollar compared with the same period in 202 1. Period -end Sterling exchange rates were stronger against the Euro and the Yen and weaker against the US Dollar compared with the 202 1 period -end rates . Name change GSK announces that it will change its company name to GSK plc from GlaxoSmithKline plc from a date in mid-May. A subsequent announcement will be made when the name change becomes effective. The company's stock ticker on the LSE and NYSE (\"GSK\") will not c hange. No action is required on the part of any equity holders with respect to their rights as an equity holder.

This primarily reflected the Total profit for the period, the re -measurement gains on the defined benefit plans plus an increase in intangible assets, other non -current assets and trade receivables . These increases were partially offset by the decrease in fair value of equity investments and the dividends paid during the period. Cash and cash equivalents and long term borrowings increased due to the Consumer Healthcare bond debt issuance. The carrying value of investments in asso ciates and joint ventures at 31 March 2022 was \u00a3 83 million (31 December 202 1: \u00a388 million), with a market value of \u00a3 83 million (31 December 202 1: \u00a388 million). At 31 March 2022, the net deficit on the Group's pension plans was \u00a3 914 million compared with \u00a3 1,129 million at 31 December 202 1. The decrease in the net deficit primarily relate to increase in the rates used to discount UK pension liabilities from 2.0% to 2. 8%, and US pension liabilities from 2. 7% to 3.7%, partly offset by an increas e in the UK inflation rate from 3.2% to 3. 5%, increase in the US cash balance credit rate from 2.0% to 2.4% and lower UK asset values . The estimated present value of the potential redemption amount of the Pfizer put option related to ViiV Healthcare, re corded in Other payables in Current liabilities, was \u00a3 1,040 million (31 December 202 1: \u00a31,008 million). Contingent consideration amounted to \u00a3 6,169 million at 3 1 March 2022 (31 December 202 1: \u00a36,076 million), of which \u00a3 5,607 million (31 December 202 1: \u00a35,559 million) represented the estimated present value of amounts payable to Shionogi relating to ViiV Healthcare and \u00a3 529 million (31 December 202 1: \u00a347 9 million) represented the estimated present value of contingent consideration payable to Novartis rel ated to the Vaccines acquisition. Of the contingent consideration payable (on a post -tax basis) to Shionogi at 3 1 March 2022, \u00a3947 million (31 December 202 1: \u00a3937 million) is expected to be paid within one year .

OVARIO featured an updated analysis from this phase II study evaluating Zejula in combination with bevacizumab, an anti - vascular endothelial growth factor antibody (VEGFA) targeted cancer medicine, as first -line maintenance therapy in patients with ovarian cancer following platinum -based chemotherapy and bevacizumab. ROYAL was a real -world evidence study examining the evolution of the ovarian cancer treatment paradigm in the US and Europe f rom 2017 to 2020. The findings from this study showed that the use of 1L maintenance PARP inhibitor monotherapy increased over time and the use of VEGF inhibitor monotherapy decreased over time. These findings also showed that many patients with advanced ovarian cancer did not receive 1L maintenance therapy and treatment patterns vary by country. In addition, GSK's alliance partner Zai Lab Limited presented a late -breaking oral presentation of the PRIME phase III trial, which evaluated Zejula (independently manufactured by Zai Lab) in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer using an individualised starting dose. Zejula demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression -free survival (PFS) with a tolerable safety profile in the overall study population, regardless of biomarker status, when compared to placebo.

GSK also uses a number of adjusted, non -IFRS, measures to report the performance of its business. Adjusted results and other non -IFRS measures may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted resu lts are defined on page 20 and other non -IFRS measures are defined below. Free cash flow Free cash flow is defined as the net cash inflow/outflow from operating activities less capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, co ntingent consideration payments, net finance costs, and dividends paid to non -controlling interests plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and dividends received from joint ventures and associates. It is used by management for planning and reporting purposes and in discussions with and presentations to investment analysts and rating agencies. Free cash flow growth is calculated on a reported basis. A reconciliation of net cash inflow from operations to free cash flow is set out on page 33. Free cash flow conversion Free cash flow conversion is free cash flow as a percentage of earnings. Working capital Working capital represents inventory and trade receivables less trade payables. CER and AER growth In order to illustrate underlying performance, it is the Group's practice to discuss its results in terms of constant exchange rate (CER) growth. This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results of overseas companies in Sterling had remained unchanged from those used in the comparative period. CER% represents growth at constant exchange rates. \u00a3% or AER% represents growth at actual exchange rates. Net debt Net debt is defined as total borrowings less cash, cash equivalents, liquid investments, and short -term loans to third parties that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. COVID -19 solutions COVID -19 solutions include the sales of pandemic adjuvant and other COVID -19 solutions including vaccine manufacturing and Xevudy and the associated costs but does not include reinvestment in R&D. This categorisation is used by management and we believe is helpful to investors through providing clarity on the results of the Group by showing the contribution to growth from COVID -19 solutions . New GSK New GSK refers to the current GSK group excluding the Consumer Healthcare business that is intended to be (or will have been) demerged. General Medicines General Medicines are usually prescribed in the primary care or community settings by general healthcare practitioners. For GSK, this includes medicines in inhaled respiratory, dermatology, antibiotics and other diseases. Specialty Medicines Specialty Medicines are typically prescription medicines used to treat complex or rare chronic conditions. For GSK, this comprises medicines in infectious diseases, HIV, oncology, immunology and respiratory. Organic revenue growth Organic growth represents revenue growth as determined under IFRS excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestments and closures of brands or businesses, revenue attributable to manufacturing service agreements relating to divestments and the closure of sites or brands, at CER . Biopharma Biopharma refers to sales in Commercial Operations. Brand names and partner acknowledgements Brand names appearing in italics throughout this document are trademarks of GSK or associated companies or used under licence by the Group. Press release Q1 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 April 2022 , London, U.K . 43 Guidance , assumptions and cautionary statements 2022 guidance For new GSK we expect sales to grow between 5% to 7% CER and Adjusted operating profit to grow between 12% to 14% CER as compared with 2021. This guidance is provided at CER and excludes the commercial benefit of COVID -19 solutions . Assumptions related to 2022 guidance In outlining the guidance for 2022, the Group has made certain assumptions about the healthcare sector, the different markets in which the Group operates and the delivery of revenues and financial benefits from its current portfolio, pipeline and restructuring programmes. The Group also assumes that the demerger of our Consumer Healthcare business w ill be delivered in July 2022 and this guidance relates only to new GSK. The Group has made planning assumptions for 2022 that healthcare systems will approach normality as the year progresses, and we expect sales of Specialty Medicines to grow approximat ely 10% CER and sales of General Medicines to show a slight decrease, primarily reflecting increased genericisation of established Respiratory medicines. Vaccines sales are expected to grow at a low teens percentage at CER for the year. However, as noted a t the time of announcing full-year 2021 results, we anticipated governments' prioritisation of COVID -19 vaccination programmes and ongoing measures to contain the pandemic would result in some continued disruption to adult immunisations. In the first -quart er 2022 Shingrix demonstrated strong demand recovery, particularly in the US, as well as channel inventory build and the benefit of a favourable comparator to Q1 2021. Despite the potential for short -term pandemic disruption, we continue to expect strong double -digit grow th and record annual sales for Shingrix in 2022 based on strong demand in existing markets and continued geographical expansion. Guidance also includes the future benefit in royalty income from the settlement and license agreement with Gilead announced on 1 February 2022. These planning assumptions as well as operating profit guidance and dividend expectations assume no material interruptions to supply of the Group's products, no material mergers, acquisitions or disposals, no material litigation or investigation costs for the company (s ave for those that are already recognised or for which provisions have been made) and no change in the Group's shareholdings in ViiV Healthcare. The assumptions also assume no material changes in the healthcare environment or unexpected significant changes in pricing as a result of government or competitor action. The 2022 guidance factors in all divestments and product exits announced to date. The Group's guidance assumes successful delivery of the Group's integration and restructuring plans. It also assumes that the separation programme to deliver the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business is delivered successfully. Material costs for investment in new product launches and R&D have been factored into the expectations given. Given the potential development options in the Group's pipeline, the outlook may be affected by additional data -driven R&D investment decisions. The guidance is given on a constant currency basis. Assumptions and cautionary statement regarding forward -looking statements The Group's management believes that the assumptions outlined above are reasonable, and that the guidance, outlooks, ambitions and expectations described in this report are achievable based on those assumptions. However, given the forward -looking nature of th ese guidance, outlooks, ambitions and expectations, they are subject to greater uncertainty, including potential material impacts if the above assumptions are not realised, and other material impacts related to foreign exchange fluctuations, macro -economic activity, the impact of outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID -19 pandemic and ongoing challenges and uncertainties posed by the COVID -19 pandemic for businesses and governments around the world, changes in legislation, regulation, governmen t actions or intellectual property protection, product development and approvals, actions by our competitors, and other risks inherent to the industries in which we operate. This document contains statements that are, or may be deemed to be, \"forward -looking statements\". Forward -looking statements give the Group's current expectations or forecasts of future events. An investor can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, dividend payments and financial resu lts. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations (including under the Market Abuse Regulation, the UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority), the Group undertakes no obligation to u pdate any forward -looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The reader should, however, consult any additional disclosures that the Group may make in any documents which it publishes and/or files with the SEC. All readers, wherever located, should take note of these disclosures. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any particular expectation will be met and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward -looking statements. All outlook s, ambitions considerations should be read together with; for Haleon the section \"Assumptions and cautionary statement and regarding forward -looking statements\" on page 163 of the Haleon Capital Markets Day all presentation slides dated 28 February 2022, a nd for GSK pages 5 -7 of the Stock Exchange announcement relating to an update to investors dated 23 June 2021 and the Guidance, assumptions and cautionary statements of our Q 2 2021 earnings release . Forward -looking statements are subject to assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which relate to factors that are beyond the Group's control or precise estimate. The Group cautions investors that a number of important factors, including tho se in this document, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward -looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 3.D 'Risk Factors' in the Group's Annual Report on Form 20 -F for 202 1 and any impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. Any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Group speak only as of the date they are made and are based upon the knowledge and information available to the Directors on the dat e of this report. Press release Q1 Results summary Research and development Quarterly performance Total and Adjusted results Financial information Issued: Wednesday, 27 April 2022 , London, U.K . 44 Independent review report to GlaxoSmithKline plc We have been engaged by GlaxoSmithKline plc (\"the Company\") to review the condensed financial information in the Results Announcement of the Company for the three months ended 31 March 2022. What we have reviewed The condensed financial information comprise s: the income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the three month period ended 31 March 2022 on pages 22 to 23; the balance sheet as at 3 1 March 2022 on page 26; the statement of changes in equity for the three month period then ended on page 27; the cash flow statement for the three month period then ended on page 28 and; the accounting policies and basis of preparation and the explanatory notes to the condensed financial information on pages 24 to 25 and 29 to 3 3 that have been prepared applying consistent accounting policies to those applied by the Group in the Annual Report 2021, which was prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as adopted by the United Kingdom . We ha ve read the other information contained in the Results Announcement, including the non -IFRS measures contained on pages 24 to 25 and 29 to 3 3, and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of financial statements. This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 \"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\" issued by the Auditing Practices B oard. Our work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to it in an independent review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibilit y to anyone other than the Company, for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed. Directors' responsibilities The Results Announcement of GlaxoSmithKline plc, including the condensed financial information , is the responsibil ity of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the Results Announcement by applying consistent accounting policies to those applied by the Group in the Annual Report 2021, which are prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the United Kingdom. Our responsibility Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the interim financial information in the Results Announcement based on our review. Scope of review We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 \"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\" issued by the Auditing Practices Board f or use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit condu cted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opi nion. Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed financial information in the Results Announcement for the three months ended 31 March 2022 are not prepared, in all material respects in a ccounting policies set out in the accounting policies and basis of preparation section on page 31.
