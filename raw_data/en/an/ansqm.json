The Defense Health Program (DHP) Operation and Maintenance (O&M) appropriation funding provides for worldwide medical and dental services to active forces and other eligible beneficiaries, veterinary services, occupational and industrial health care, specialized services for the training of medical personnel, and medical command headquarters. Included are costs associated with the delivery of the TRICARE benefit which provides for the health care of eligible active duty family members, retired members and their family members, and the eligible surviving family members of deceased active duty and retired members. The FY 2016 budget request of $30,889.9 million includes realistic cost growth for health care services either provided in the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) or purchased from the private sector through the managed care support contracts, and for pharmaceuticals. This budget includes funding for continued support of Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health (TBI/PH) and Wounded, Ill and Injured (WII) requirements. It complies with the Congressional mandate related to support of Centers of Excellence (COE) and Department of Defense's initiative for operations efficiencies, including savings from the consolidation of like services to shared services and for proposed military healthcare reform initiatives. Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding is divided into seven major areas: In\u00adHouse Care, Private Sector Care, Information Management, Education and Training, Management Activities, Consolidated Health Support, and Base Operations. The DoD Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund (MERHCF) is an accrual fund to pay for DoD's share of applicable Direct Care and Private Sector Care operation and maintenance health care costs for Medicare\u00adeligible retirees, retiree family members and survivors. The DHP appropriation also funds the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) program for medical Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT), research to reduce medical capability gaps, and support to both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) medical laboratory facilities. The DHP appropriation Procurement program funds acquisition of capital equipment in MTFs and other selected health care activities which include equipment for initial outfitting of newly constructed, expanded, or modernized health care facilities; equipment for modernization and replacement of uneconomically reparable items; equipment supporting programs such as pollution control, clinical investigation, and Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA\u00ad19, Appropriation Highlights DHP\u00ad3occupational/environmental health; and Military Health System (MHS) information technology (IT) requirements. Narrative Explanation of FY 2015 and FY 2016 Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Changes: The DHP O&M funding reflects an overall increase of $877.9 million between FY 2015 and FY 2016, consisting of $863.6 million in price growth and a net program increase of $14.3 million.

Pending Congressional action to extend the DoD\u00adVA Health Care Joint Incentive Fund (JIF) the Department will transfer $15 million to the JIF in FY 2016. Authority for the JIF, established by Section 8111, Title 38, of the United States Code (USC) and Section 721 of Public Law 107\u00ad314(National Defense Authorization Act for 2003) expires on September 30, 2015. This fund combines the resources of the DoD and VA to implement, fund, and evaluate creative coordination and sharing initiatives at the facility, intraregional, and nationwide levels. Narrative Explanation of FY 2015 and FY 2016 Research Development Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) Changes: The DHP RDT&E Program reflects a net decrease of $750.5 million between FY 2015 and FY 2016. This includes price growth of $29.4 million and a net program decrease of $779.9 million. Program increases include:Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA\u00ad19, Appropriation Highlights DHP\u00ad5$347.0 million in additional funding for the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) in order to support requirements review/finalization, configuration, integration and testing efforts. $11.0 million realignment from the integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) Program Element (PE) to support the newly established DoD Medical Information Exchange & Interoperability (DMIX) PE initiative. $12.0 million for phased requirements based on the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) phase I safety certifications for Beneficial Occupancy Date (BOD). Program decreases include: $1,076.1 million due to the reversal of FY 2015 one\u00adtime Congressional adds to the Defense Health Program RDT&E appropriation. $60.8 million reduction to Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) due to approved funding profile adjustments provided in departmental fiscal guidance for the integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR)/Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX). $5.2 million is realigned to O&M for proper execution of operations support activities at the Pacific Based Joint Information Technology Center - Maui (PJITC\u00adMaui). $4.9 million in IO&T requirements associated with the military construction of the new US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD) which is nearing completion. $2.9 million in various smaller enhancements/realignments(these are net of increases and decreases). Narrative Explanation of FY 2015 and FY 2016 Procurement Changes: The DHP Procurement Program has a net increase of $64.9 million between FY 2015 and FY 2016. This consists of $8.2 million in price growth and increased program growth of $56.7 million. Program increases include: $29.4 million to support the Composite Health Care System (CHCS) and Armed Forced Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) sustainment activities required until the modernized electronic health record reaches full operational capability. $22.8 million restoral of Budget Control Act (BCA) reductions for replacement and modernization of critical healthcare equipment.Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA\u00ad19, Appropriation Highlights DHP\u00ad6$10.0 million increase for AHLTA End User Devices (EUDs). $7.5 million associated with the start of planned Health Artifact and Image Management Solution (HAIMS) refresh activities. $5.4 million for infrastructure technology refresh supporting the Medical Community of Interest (MEDCOI). $2.8 million associated with implementation of Enterprise Blood Management System \u00ad Donor module. Program decreases include: $16.0 million transfer to the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to support the build\u00adout of four (4) additional Non\u00adClassified Internet Protocol Routers (NIPR) Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS), upgrade to the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), and the build\u00adout of the Joint Management Suite (JMS). $2.1 million for a one\u00adtime Procurement increase for Health Information Technology Portfolio Rationalization in FY 2015. $1.7 million for Theater Medical Information Program \u00ad Joint (TMIP\u00adJ) Increment 2 obtaining a full deployment decision. Remaining Procurement will transition to the Operational Medicine project for train the trainer activities. $1.4 million reduction associated with revised cost and schedule for iEHR/Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX). President's Management Plan - Performance Metrics Requirements: The DHP continues to refine existing performance measures and develop specific criterion to determine and measure outputs/outcomes as compared with initial goals. Over the past year the DHP continues the transition to the Quadruple Aim that is focused on a balanced approach to overall performance to include not only production but outcome measures related to medical readiness, a healthy population, positive patient experiences and responsible management of health care costs. Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA\u00ad19, Appropriation Highlights DHP\u00ad7Individual Medical Readiness \u00ad This measure provides operational commanders, Military Department leaders and primary care managers the ability to monitor the medical readiness status of their personnel, ensuring a healthy and fit fighting force medically ready to deploy. This represents the best\u00adavailable indicator of the medical readiness of the Total Force, Active Components and Reserve Components prior to deployment. Beneficiary Satisfaction with Health Plan - An increase in the satisfaction with the Health Plan indicates that actions being taken are improving the overall functioning of the plan from the beneficiary perspective. Improvements represent positive patient experiences with the health care benefit and services they receive through the system. The goal is to improve overall satisfaction level to that of civilian plans using a standard survey instrument. Medical Cost Per Member Per Year - Annual Cost Growth - The medical cost per member per year looks at the overall cost of the Prime enrollees for the DHP. This tracks all costs related to care delivered to enrollees. The objective is to keep the rate of cost growth for the treatment of TRICARE enrollees to a level at or below the Civilian health care plans rate increases at the national level. Currently the measure provides insight to issues regarding unit cost, utilization management, and Purchased care management. The metric has been enhanced to properly account for differences in population demographics and health care requirements of the enrolled population. Since enrollment demographics can vary significantly by Service, and across time, it is important to adjust the measure. For example, as increasing numbers of older individuals enroll, the overall average medical expense per enrollee would likely increase. Conversely, as younger, healthy active duty enroll, the overall average would likely decrease. Through the use of adjustment factors, a comparison across Services and across time is made more meaningful.Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA\u00ad19, Appropriation Highlights DHP\u00ad8Output related measures that influence Medical Cost Per Member Per Year: Inpatient Production Target (Medicare Severity Adjusted Relative Weighted Products, referred to as MS\u00adRWPs) - Achieving the production targets ensures that the initial plan for allocation of personnel and resources are used appropriately in the production of inpatient workload. Outpatient Production Target (Relative Value Units, referred to as RVUs) - Achieving the production targets ensures that the initial plans for allocation of personnel and resources are used appropriately in the production of outpatient workload. Below is reporting for FY 2014 related to the prior performance measure goals. The next reporting period will focus on the measures related to the Quadruple Aim, and two output measures related to production plan targets. The overall success of each area measured is discussed below along with information related to continuation of reporting in future documents: Individual Medical Readiness - The Military Health System achieved the goal for the Total Force Medical Readiness for FY 2014 with a score of 86% compared to the goal of 85%. This is the first time the MHS has reported this high of an overall performance level for the measure, and will have to take significant steps to ensure that performance can be sustained. This measure will continue to be reported in support of the Quadruple Aim. Beneficiary Satisfaction with Health Plan - Satisfaction with Health Care Plan performance for FY 2014 exceeded the goal of 57 percent for the fiscal year. Continuous increases in enrollment and improvement in the score demonstrates real progress for the program with respect to satisfying our beneficiaries. While progress on this metric demonstrates program success, changes to the number of individuals covered by the TRICARE Prime benefit over the next couple of years may result in a decreased overall satisfaction with the Health Plan. This measure will continue to be reported in support of the Quadruple Aim. Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA\u00ad19, Appropriation Highlights DHP\u00ad9Inpatient Production Target (MS\u00adRWPs) - For the most recent reported monthly data for FY 2014, the MHS produced 215 thousand MS\u00adRWPs against a target of 214 thousand MS\u00adRWPs slightly above the target. These numbers are based on the records reported to date, and will increase slightly as all records are completed. This measure will continue to be reported as an output measure for the DHP. Outpatient Production Target (RVUs) - With an increased emphasis on paying for performance, the system has seen a renewed focus on production of outpatient care. For FY 2014, the system produced 78 million relative value units versus a goal of 81 million relative value units. The MHS failed to achieve the goal for the year, but expects continued improvements in the coming years. Approximately 25 percent of the shortage is related to procedure weight changes affecting inappropriate weighting of workload for some non\u00adcredential providers that was corrected in FY2014, but included in the baseline and target when developed last year. Additionally, the MHS was unable to continue some contracts and may be experiencing some of the declined utilization from the implementation of Patient Medical Homes earlier than expected. This measure will continue to be reported as an output measure for the DHP. Medical Cost Per Member Per Year - Annual Cost Growth - The Year to Date performance estimate for FY 2014 is 2.6% vs goal of 2.8%. While final claims data are still lagging, the system was able to achieve the goal during the fiscal year. A significant reason for keeping the low growth rates is related to the lack of salary inflation increases for Department civilian employees, as well very limited inflationary growth for Military. Additionally, while utilization increased slightly, it remains below the utilization growth rates experienced in the past. The MHS continues to see improvements related to changes made with respect to the outpatient prospective payments in Purchased Care and Patient Centered Medical Home within Direct Care. The expectation is that the improvements should continue into FY 2015 where the measure will continue to be reported.(This page intentionally left blank)Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Operation and Maintenance Funding Exhibit O\u00ad1, Funding by BA/AG/SAG (Budget Years) DHP\u00ad11Total Obligational Authority (Dollars in Thousands) 0130D Defense Health Program FY 20141/FY 2015 Enacted2/FY 2016 Requested3/ Base + OCO Base OCO Total Base OCO Total BUDGET ACTIVITY 01: OPERATION & MAINTENANCE Operations (OCO) funding of 715.484M for O&M, Congressional Special Interests (CSI) of \u00ad948.739M for 822.786M for RDT&E, and \u00ad229.417M for RDT&E 3/ FY 2016 reflects Requested amounts(This page intentionally left blank)Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Summary of Price and Program Growth Exhibit OP\u00ad32, Summary of Price and Program Growth DHP\u00ad13FY 2014 ProgramForeign Currency Rate DiffPrice Growth 00.00% 25 \u00ad958 1,134 40,952 00.00% 14,353Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Summary of Price and Program Growth Exhibit OP\u00ad32, Summary of Price and Program Growth DHP\u00ad14FY 2014 ProgramForeign Currency Rate DiffPrice Growth Program Surface Warfare 0 812 812 01.48% 12 4 2,867 00.00% 0 0 0Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Summary of Price and Program Growth Exhibit OP\u00ad32, Summary of Price and Program Growth DHP\u00ad15FY 2014 ProgramForeign Currency Rate DiffPrice Growth 40 02.50% 1 0 41 930Other Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Summary of Price and Program Growth Exhibit OP\u00ad32, Summary of Price and Program Growth DHP\u00ad16FY 2014 ProgramForeign Currency Rate DiffPrice Growth 0 0 \u00ad103 1,352 01.70% 0 00.00% 0 0 Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Personnel Summary Exhibit PB\u00ad31R, Personnel Summary DHP\u00ad17FY 2014 FY 2015 FY Foreign National Direct Hire 1,007 0 Total Direct Hire 59,989 65,882 64,593 0 Memo: Reimbursable Civilians Included 213 218 218 0 Active Military Average Strength (A/S) 62,438 \u00ad2,209 Foreign National Direct Hire 935 945 945 0 Total Direct Hire 59,259 65,592 63,383 \u00ad2,209 0 Memo: Reimbursable Civilians Included Contractor FTEs (Total) 22,347 22,494 23,503 1,009 Personnel Summary Explanations Note: Some numbers do not add due to rounding.(This page intentionally left blank)Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Physicians' Comparability Allowance Worksheet DoD Physicians Comparability Allowance PY 2 (Actual)CY 2 015 (Estimates)BY 2 016* (Estimates) 1) Number of Physicians Receiving PCAs 10 10 10 2) Number of Physicians with One-Year PCA Agreements 0 0 0 3) Number of Physicians with Multi-Year PCA Agreements 10 10 10 4) Average Annual PCA P hysician Pay (without PCA p ayment) 160052 160052 Annual PCA P ayment 34540 34540 34540 Category I Clinical Position 0 0 0 Category II Research Position 9 9 9 Category III Occupational Health 0 0 0 Category IV-A Di sability Evaluation 0 0 06) Number of Physicians Receiving PCAs by Category (non-add) Category IV-B He alth and Medical Admin. 1 1 1 *FY 2016 data will be approved during the FY 2017 Budget cycle. 7) If applicable, list and explain the necessity of any additional physician categories designated by your agency (for categories other than I through IV-B).

(Please include any staffing data to support your explanation, such as number and duration of unfilled positions and number of accessions and separations per fiscal year.) PCA has negated all our retention problems. All our employees receiving PCA are multi-year agreements. PCA allows the Command to craft compensation packages that are competitive with the local market points in the area.Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Physicians' Comparability Allowance Worksheet DoD Physicians Comparability Allowance (PCA) Worksheet DHP\u00ad2010) Explain the degree to which recruitment and retention problems were alleviated in your agency through the use of PCAs in the prior fiscal year. (Please include any staffing data to support your explanation, such as number and duration of unfilled positions and number of accessions and separations per fiscal year.) Because of the use of PCA we were able to retain our current workforce. Without PCA our losses, other than normal attrition would have increased and impacted our ability to accomplish our mission. PCA allows for competitive compensation packages. Furlough and the hiring freeze had more impact on gains and losses. 11) Provide any additional information that may be useful in planning PCA staffing levels and am ounts in your agenc y.

Information Management INFOM\u00ad88(DHMSM) and the Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX), that are managed by the Health Information Technology (HIT) Directorate of the Defense Health Agency. Resourced HIT activities include: Innovation and Advanced Technology; Infrastructure and Operations; Solution Delivery; Information Delivery; Cyber Security; and Portfolio Management and Customer Relations. These resources are used for program management of DHA programs, system and infrastructure sustainment, annual software licensing fees, and software and hardware maintenance fees, including resources incrementally transferring from DHP Components to the HIT Shared Service. Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) \u00ad Resources iEHR information technology acquisition program to provide seamless integrated sharing of electronic health data between the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs. In March 2008, the DHP embarked upon Electronic Health Record (EHR) modernization planning, establishing the initial Electronic Health Records Way Ahead (EHRWA). In March 2011, the Program was expanded to include the VA in a joint initiative to implement a new, integrated electronic health record for both Departments, called the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program. Secretary of Defense Memorandum titled \"Integrated Electronic Health Records,\" dated May 2013, provided additional direction to the program: DoD shall continue near\u00adterm coordinated efforts with VA to develop data federation, presentation, and interoperability. This near\u00adterm goal shall be pursued as a first priority separately from the longer\u00adterm goal of health record information technology (IT) modernization. DoD shall pursue a full and open competition for a core set of capabilities for EHR modernization.Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Information Management I.Description of Operations Financed (cont.) Information Management INFOM\u00ad89To fulfill Secretary of Defense directive, parallel programs have been defined, splitting the original iEHR program into two distinct areas. In the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) Acquisition Decision Memoranda (ADM), dated June 21, 2013 and January 2, 2014, the former joint DoD and VA Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program was restructured to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program and a newly defined iEHR focused on providing seamless integrated sharing of electronic health data between the DoD and VA to be called Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX). The remaining iEHR Increment 1 (iEHR Inc 1) was significantly de\u00adscoped to only the Medical Single Sign\u00adon/Context Management (MSSO/CM) implemented at James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (JAL FHCC). Department of Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization Program (DHMSM) \u00ad Resources modernization of the legacy DoD health care electronic health record (EHR) information technology systems. DHMSM will acquire and support deployment, implementation, and sustainment of an electronic health record (EHR) system that replaces the DoD legacy DHP inpatient and outpatient EHR systems. Overarching goal of the program is to enable healthcare teams to deliver high\u00adquality, safe care and preventive services to patients through the use of easily accessible standards\u00adbased computerized patient records resulting in: improved accuracy of diagnoses and impact on health outcomes; increased patient participation in the healthcare process; improved patient\u00adcentered care coordination; and increased practice efficiencies in all settings, including operational environments. DoD Medical Information Exchange and Interoperability (DMIX) - Resources the acquisition of the capabilities necessary to securely and reliably exchange standardized, normalized, Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Information Management I.Description of Operations Financed (cont.) Information Management INFOM\u00ad90and correlated health data with all partners through standard data / information exchange mechanisms. DMIX program will acquire the capabilities necessary to securely and reliably exchange standardized, normalized, and correlated health data with all partners through standard data/information exchange mechanisms. This allows users in different places and different organizations to access, use, and supplement health data (technical interoperability) that has a shared meaning so users (assisted by computers) are able to make care decisions (Semantic Interoperability - Level 4). DMIX manages the data exchange capability from legacy data stores in order to prepare for the transition to the modernized Electronic Health Record platform being acquired by DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM). DMIX consists of a family of capability initiatives supporting the seamless exchange of standardized health data among DoD, VA, other Federal agencies, and private providers as well as benefits administrators. The DMIX program provides the capability for health care providers to access and view complete and accurate patient health records from a variety of data sources thereby allowing healthcare providers to make faster and higher quality care decisions. DMIX was established in accordance with the joint memo from USD(C) and USD(AT&L) titled \"Joint Memorandum on Major Defense Acquisition Program and Major Automated Information System Program Resource Transparency in Department of Defense Budget Systems\" dated June 27, 2013.

Funds identified in this submission support the acquisition of equipment for facilities in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and National Capital Region Medical Directorate (NCRMD). Those facilities range from sophisticated tertiary care medical centers to outpatient medical and dental clinics and physiological training units. This equipment is essential to provide high quality health care services that meet accepted standards of practice. The required safety standards, related laws and regulatory requirements from credentialing and health care standard setting organizations influence and affect the requirement for, cost of, and replacement and modernization of medical equipment. Without the identified resources, the DHP's capability to meet the Department's medical equipment requirements will be severely degraded. The Department, through the DHP, procures a wide variety of medical items ranging from surgical, radiographic, and pathologic apparatus to medical administrative support equipment. The items to be procured by the resources identified in this schedule are selected by way of a thorough investment equipment justification process. The identification and justification process begins at the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) level. From there, the requirements are reviewed by functional specialty advisor groups (Surgeon General level), medical logistics experts (Service component), Health Care Support Offices (geographically oriented), and ultimately the Defense Health Agency (Tri\u00adService level). At each level, the requirements are reviewed for the necessity, value, and utility of investment. Development of an effective equipment replacement and modernization program is a complicated process. In comparison to equipment in other functional areas, the useful life of medical equipment is short. As the current inventory reaches obsolescence, replacements are generally more sophisticated, technologically advanced, and expensive. To ensure that the Department is procuring the appropriate technology for deployment in the most useful locations, the DHP incorporates functional expertise from each echelon of the Department's medical structure into the budget development process. This submission represents a balanced, comprehensive approach to the Military Health Systems' investment equipment requirements. The requirements funded by the DHP Procurement Budget are diverse. The budget funds replacement of aging real property support system in existing facilities and medical information system implementation, initial training, software purchases and hardware replacements, such as servers and End User Devises (EUDs). The Theater Medical Information Program \u00ad Joint (TMIP\u00adJ) integrates components of the Military Health System sustaining base systems and the Services\u00b4 medical information systems to ensure timely interoperable medical support for mobilization, deployment and sustainment of all Theater and deployed forces in support of any mission. Funding will be used for implementation and training through FY15. Starting in FY16, Procurement funding transitions to support Operational Medicine Support implementation and training activities (FY16 = $1.494M, FY17 = $2.907M).Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Defense Health Program Procurement Program Exhibit P\u00ad1, Procurement Program DHP\u00ad207The former joint DoD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Electronic Health Record (EHR) program has been restructured within the DoD to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) Program and the DoD EHR/Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX) Program. In the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) Acquisition Decision Memoranda (ADM), dated June 21, 2013 and January 2, 2014, the former joint DoD and VA Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) Program was restructured to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program and a newly defined iEHR, Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX). focused on providing seamless integrated sharing of electronic health data between the DoD and VA. The remaining iEHR Increment 1 (iEHR Inc 1) was significantly de\u00adscoped to only the Medical Single Sign\u00adon/Context Management (MSSO/CM) implemented at James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (JAL FHCC). Information Technology Deployment and Sustainment \u00ad DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) will acquire and support deployment, implementation, and sustainment of an electronic health record (EHR) system that replaces the DoD legacy MHS inpatient and outpatient EHR systems. Overarching goal of the program is to enable healthcare teams to deliver high\u00ad quality, safe care and preventive services to patients through the use of easily accessible standards\u00adbased computerized patient records resulting in: improved accuracy of diagnoses and impact on health outcomes; increased patient participation in the healthcare process; improved patient\u00adcentered care coordination; and increased practice efficiencies in all settings, including operational environments. DoD Medical Information Exchange (DMIX) Program will acquire the capabilities necessary to securely and reliably exchange standardized, normalized, and correlated health data with all partners through standard data/information exchange mechanisms. This allows users in different places and different organizations to access, use, and supplement health data (technical interoperability) that has a shared meaning so users (assisted by computers) are able to make care decisions (Semantic Interoperability - Level 4). DMIX manages the data exchange capability from legacy data stores in order to prepare for the transition to the modernized Electronic Health Record platform being acquired by DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM). DMIX consists of a family of capability initiatives supporting the seamless exchange of standardized health data among DoD, VA, other Federal agencies, and private providers as well as benefits administrators. The DMIX program provides the capability for health care providers to access and view complete and accurate patient health records from a variety of data sources thereby allowing healthcare providers to make faster and higher quality care decisions. DMIX was established in accordance with the joint memo from Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and USD(AT&L) titled \"Joint Memorandum on Major Defense Acquisition Program and Major Automated Information System Program Resource Transparency in Department of Defense Budget Systems\" dated June 27, 2013.(This page intentionally left blank)Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Defense Health Program Procurement Budget Item Justification Exhibit P\u00ad40, Budget Item Justification, Procurement Program DHP\u00ad209BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET DATE: February 2015 APPROPRIATION / BUDGET ACTIVITY : 97*0130P\u00ad1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE: Replacement/Modernization Enacted Base OCOTotal Request Estimate Estimate Estimate Estimate Quantity Total Cost 2016 Budget Estimates Defense Health Program Procurement Budget Item Justification Exhibit P\u00ad40, Budget Item Justification, Procurement Program DHP\u00ad210 REMARKS The most significant medical equipment investments will be in the radiographic, surgical, and information systems functional areas. The driving factors are rapid technological advancements in these areas and the need for DoD's health care delivery system to maintain the standards of care set by the civilian health care sector. Procurement investments for information systems will cover software license acquisitions, infrastructure, hardware replacement such as End User Devices, Local Area Network (LAN) upgrades and servers supporting Military Health System (MHS) Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) which is composed of the MHS Health Information Technology Program (Tri\u00adService component, previously known as centrally\u00admanaged IM/IT), three Military Departments (MilDep) medical IM/IT components, Defense Health Agency (DHA) IM/IT, and the National Capital Region Medical Directorate (NCRMD) IM/IT. Funding will also support deployment of the Wounded, Ill, Injured (WII) Health Artifact and Image Management Solution (HAIMS). Financing an adequate equipment acquisition budget is critical in retaining the Department's medical workload in\u00adhouse and controlling purchased healthcare costs in the private sector. The items supported by this budget are the result of an extensive investment equipment justification process and are necessary to provide properly trained medical department personnel and high quality, cost effective health care services for the eligible beneficiary population.Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Defense Health Program Procurement Budget Item Justification Exhibit P\u00ad40, Budget Item Justification, Procurement Program DHP\u00ad211BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET DATE: February 2015 APPROPRIATION / BUDGET ACTIVITY : 97*0130 P\u00ad1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE: New FY 2020 Actuals Enacted Base OCOTotal Request Estimate Estimate Estimate Estimate Quantity Total Cost 2016 Budget Estimates Defense Health Program Procurement Budget Item Justification Exhibit P\u00ad40, Budget Item Justification, Procurement Program DHP\u00ad212 REMARKS The new facility outfitting program element of the DHP Procurement Budget funds the acquisition and installation of commercially available equipment to furnish new and expanded facilities being completed under military construction projects in support of dental services, health care delivery, health care training, and other health care activities.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Guidance for Development of the Force - Applied Biomedical Technology: This applied research funding is to refine concepts and ideas into potential solutions to military health and performance problems, with a view towards evaluating technical feasibility. Included are studies and investigations leading to candidate solutions that may involve use of animal models for testing in preparation for initial human testing. Research in this Program Element (PE) is designed to address the following: Areas of interest to the Secretary of Defense regarding Wounded Warriors, capabilities identified through the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, and sustainment of priority investments in science, technology, research, and development as stated the strategy and initiatives described in the Quadrennial Defense Review. Program development is peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Military Services, appropriate Defense Agencies or Activities, and other federal agencies, to include the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Homeland Security. This coordination occurs through the planning and execution activities of the Joint Program Committees (JPCs), established for the Defense Health Program (DHP) Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding. Research supported by this PE includes hemorrhage (bleeding) and resuscitation, diagnosis and treatment of brain injury, Volume 1 - 17UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602115HP: Applied Biomedical Technology UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 2 of 22 R-1 Line #3Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2016 Defense Health Program Date: February 2015 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0602115HP / Applied Biomedical Technology treatments for extremity trauma (injury to tissue, head, face, jaw, and mouth, lungs, and burns), forward surgical intensive critical care, and en route care. Operational medicine efforts focus on injury prevention and reduction, psychological health and resilience, physiological health, and environmental health. Rehabilitation applied research focuses on neuromusculoskeletal injuries, pain management, regenerative medicine and sensory systems. Applied research efforts are also developing radiation medical countermeasures. And, within the area of military infectious diseases, applied researchers focus on wound infection prevention and antimicrobial countermeasures. As research efforts mature, the most promising efforts will transition to technology development (PE 0603115HP) or advanced concept development (PE 0604110HP) funding. For the Army Medical Command, beginning in FY14, the military HIV research program funding is transferred from the Army to the Defense Health Program. Work in this area includes refining improved identification methods to determine genetic diversity of the virus, preclinical work in laboratory animals including non-human primates to identify candidates for global HIV-1 vaccine, and evaluating and preparing overseas sites for clinical trials with these vaccine candidates. For the Army Medical Command, beginning in FY15, funding is provided to develop strategies to prevent, mitigate, and treat antibiotic resistant bacteria in wounds through the Combating Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria - WRAIR Discovery and Wound Program. The Army Medical Command also received DHP Congressional Special Interest (CSI) research funding focused on Peer-Reviewed Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health Research. Because of the CSI annual structure, out-year funding is not programmed. For the Air Force, this PE funds applied research which seeks to promote 'omic'-informed personalized medicine, advanced diagnostic technologies and occupational toxicology with an emphasis on targeted prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The delivery of pro-active, evidence-based, personalized medicine will improve health in Warfighters and beneficiaries by providing care that is specific to the situation and patient, to include preventing disease or injury, early and accurate diagnosis, and selection of appropriate and effective treatment. Personalized medicine will reduce morbidity, mortality, mission impact of illness/injury, and healthcare costs while increasing health and wellness of the AF population and efficiency of the healthcare system. This applied research supports multiple focus areas, each of which represents an identified barrier/gap which must be addressed for successful implementation of 'omic-informed personalized medicine. Focus areas for applied research include knowledge generation research; ethical legal and social issues/policy research; bioinformatics research; educational research; research for development of advanced genomic diagnostic system. For efforts supported by this program element, research will be pursued with the intent to support solutions that answer Air Force specific needs. During this process, the efforts of other government agencies in those areas will be assessed to avoid redundancy.

A key priority of the TBI/PH applied research program was to complement ongoing DoD efforts to ensure the health and readiness of our military forces by promoting a better standard of care for psychological health disorders and TBI in the areas of prevention, detection, diagnosis (identification of the nature and cause of an illness), treatment, and rehabilitation. Program announcements, programmatic reviews, Service-requested nominations, and ongoing studies that would benefit from program acceleration have been incorporated to address these priorities and gather proposals. In the area of TBI, researchers performed investigations to find a universally-agreed upon concussion grading system, and continued experiments into the effects of penetrating injuries on the brain and experiments on the effects of blasts on the brain. Proposals were solicited in the areas of blast-induced hyper-acceleration upon the generation of TBI and the role of inflammation in spreading TBI damage. Multiple awards relevant to combat casualty care were made including development of a large animal model of penetrating ballistic brain injury and development of metrics to define concussion and grade TBI. In the area of psychological health, researchers performed investigations to diagnose, prevent, and reduce symptoms of PTSD, and understand predictors of violence among workers in military settings.15.000 - Congressional Add: 469A - CSI - Restore Core Applied Biomedical Technology (PE 0602115) (Army) - 4.941 Volume 1 - 21UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602115HP: Applied Biomedical Technology UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 6 of 22 R-1 Line #3Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2016 Defense Date: February 2015 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130 / 2R-1 Applied TechnologyProject (Number/Name) 200A / Congressional Special Interests B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification At the President's direction in late 2013, a National Strategy was created to address the critical issue of antimicrobial resistance. This strategy was devised using an interagency approach and ultimately approved at the executive level (2014). Inherent in this work are DoD sponsored efforts to support the DOD's beneficiaries, but that simultaneously complement national efforts to prevent, detect, and control illness and death related to infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One critical need identified is for new therapeutics, to include antibiotics. This effort's focus is on the development of new/novel antibiotics, especially one targeting the most resistant and worrisome Gram negative bacterial pathogens, using existing expertise at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and leveraging other WRAIR capabilities to identify viable candidate targets for advanced discovery. This project supports (both directly and indirectly) Global Health Security Agenda priorities to respond rapidly and effectively to biological threats of international concern. B.

Injury prevention and reduction conducted applied research studies on blast injury models and performance standards for protections systems, blast exposure during breaching (process used to force open closed and/or locked doors), and diagnostics and metrics for hearing loss and protection. Psychological health and resilience focused on providing solutions that build service members, family and community resilience to sustain and restore psychological health and readiness, diagnosis of deployment-related psychological health problems, diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), military family and warfighter resilience, and suicide prevention. Physiological health conducted research on nutrition and dietary supplements, and the environmental health portfolio focused on pulmonary (pertaining to the lungs) health in the deployed environment, the incidence of pulmonary disease in returned warfighters, and warfighter performance and sustainment in extreme environments (such as extreme heat, cold, or altitude). Combat casualty care research supported multi-year studies, initiated in FY12 and FY13 with applied research being divided into portfolios for hemorrhage and resuscitation, neurotrauma, traumatic tissue injury, forward surgical intensive critical care, and joint enroute care. Within the hemorrhage and resuscitation portfolio, a consortium of universities took a systems biology approach to studying the coagulopathy of trauma. Others efforts studied techniques for modulating inflammation. The neurotrauma research efforts studied mechanisms and treatments for TBI, distinguished between primary and tertiary blast injury, evaluated neurophysiologic and systematic changes during aero-medical evacuation and enroute care, investigated TBI in animals using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathology (microscopic examination of tissue) techniques, conducted a military relevant model of closed concussive head injury in longitudinal studies characterizing and validating single and repetitive mild TBI, and developed biomarkers in animals for progressive tau (human brain protein) pathology after TBI. The traumatic tissue injury research portfolio is starting pre-clinical trials in face restoration. Forward surgical/intensive critical care research started research to address pre-hospital care, emergency care, surgical care, intensive care, nursing care, advanced monitoring and battlefield medical equipment. Joint enroute care conducted studies to automate comprehensive clinical practice guidelines to improve enroute care of combat casualties, to access blood vessels in hemorrhagic (profuse bleeding) cases, and characterize human blood vessels in normal and low blood pressure trauma patients. Promising candidate products were evaluated for transition from applied research into technology development. Radiation health effects research pursued strategies for protection, mitigation, and treatment of radiation-induced tissue injury due to high doses of radiation exposure. Conducted animal studies in mice and non-human primates to characterize several compounds with the potential to mitigate or prevent Acute Radiation Syndrome resulting from lethal doses of radiation. Additional efforts identified targets for safe, effective, and FDA-approved prevention, mitigation or treatment of radiation injury, and increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which radiation injuries are initiated and cell cycling pathways triggered leading to multi-organ system dysfunction and death.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Guidance for Development of the Force - Medical Technology Development provides funds for promising candidate solutions that are selected for initial safety and effectiveness testing in animal studies and/or small scale human clinical trials regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration prior to licensing for human use. Research in this program element (PE) is designed to address areas of interest to the Secretary of Defense related to Wounded Warriors, capabilities identified through the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, and sustainment of priority investments in science, technology, research, and development as stated in the Quadrennial Defense Review. Program development and execution is peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all of the Military Services, appropriate Defense agencies or activities and other federal agencies, to include the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Homeland Security. This coordination occurs through the planning and execution activities of the Joint Program Committees (JPCs), established for the Defense Health Program (DHP) Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding. Research supported by this PE includes JPC-1: medical simulation, health informatics, JPC-2: wound infection prevention and management, antimicrobial countermeasures, diagnostic systems for infectious diseases, JPC-5: injury prevention and reduction, psychological health and resilience, physiological health, environmental health and protection, JPC-6: hemorrhage (bleeding) and resuscitation, neurotrauma (diagnosis Volume 1 - 65UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603115HP: Medical Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 4 of 105 R-1 Line #6Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2016 Defense Health Program Date: February 2015 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0603115HP / Medical Technology Development and treatment of brain injury), traumatic tissue injury, forward surgical intensive critical care, joint en route care, military medical photonics, and JPC-8: rehabilitation of neuro-musculoskeletal injuries, pain management, regenerative medicine, and sensory system traumatic injury, restoration and rehabilitation. As research efforts mature, the most promising will transition to advanced concept development funding, PE 0604110. For knowledge products, successful findings will transition into clinical practice guidelines. For the Army Medical Command, the Underbody Blast (UBB) Testing medical research project provides funds to establish a scientific and statistical basis for evaluating skeletal injuries to vehicle occupants during ground vehicle UBB events. Areas of interest to the Secretary of Defense are medical research that provides an understanding of the human response and tolerance limits and injury mechanisms needed to accurately predict skeletal injuries to ground combat vehicle occupants caused by UBB events. This enhanced understanding will support the establishment of an improved capability to conduct Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation and to make acquisition decisions. For the Army Medical Command, beginning in FY14, Military Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Research Program funding was transferred from the Army to the DHP. This project funds research to develop candidate HIV vaccines, to assess their safety and effectiveness in human subjects, and to protect military personnel from risks associated with HIV infection. For the Army Medical Command, the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB) Deployed Warfighter Protection project provides for the development of new or improved protection of ground forces from disease-carrying insects. For the Army Medical Command, four Centers of Excellence (CoE) receive medical technology development funds. The Breast Cancer CoE (Army) provides a multidisciplinary approach as the standard of care for treating breast diseases and breast cancer. The Gynecologic CoE (Army) focuses on characterizing the molecular alterations associated with benign and malignant gynecologic disease and facilitates the development of novel early detection, prevention and biologic therapeutics (a medicinal preparation created by a biological process used to treat diseases) for the management of gynecologic disease. The Cardiac Health CoE (Army) provides evidence-based personalized patient engagement approaches for comprehensive cardiac (pertaining to the heart) event prevention through education, outcomes research and technology tools, as well as molecular research to detect cardiovascular (CV) (pertaining to the heart and blood vessels) disease at an early stage to ultimately discover a signature for CV health, to find new genes that significantly increase risk for heart attack in Service members and other beneficiaries, and identify molecular markers of obesity and weight loss. The Pain CoE (Army) examines the relationship between acute (rapid onset and/or short course) and chronic (persistent or long-lasting, usually longer than 3 months) pain and focuses on finding, implementing, and evaluating the most effective methods of relieving the acute pain caused by combat trauma and the effect this has throughout the continuum to rehabilitation and reintegration. In FY15, the Pain CoE funding line is transferred from Army to the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). In FY14, DHP funded the following Congressional Special Interest (CSI) peer-reviewed directed research programs: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (degenerative neuronal disorder that causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body), Autism, Bone Marrow Failure Disease, Ovarian Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) (disease that affects the brain and the spinal cord and causes severe physical and mental complications), Cancer, Lung Cancer, Orthopedics Research, Spinal Cord Research, Vision, Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health (TBI/PH), Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Gulf War Illness, Alcohol and Substance Use Disorders, Medical Research, Alzheimer's Research, Reconstructive Transplant, Global HIV/AIDS Prevention, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (rare multi-system genetic disease that causes growth of non-malignant tumors in the brain and other vital organs), Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (gene mutation in boys that causes muscle degeneration Volume 1 - 66UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603115HP: Medical Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 5 of 105 R-1 Line #6Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2016 Defense Health Program Date: February 2015 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0603115HP / Medical Technology Development and eventual death). CSIs also included the following programs: Joint Warfighter Medical Research, Trauma Clinical Research Repository, Orthotics and Prosthetics Outcomes, and HIV/AIDS Program Increase. Because of the CSI annual structure, out-year funding is not programmed. For the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, this program element includes funds for research management support costs. The Outside Continental US (OCONUS) laboratories conduct focused medical research on vaccine development for Malaria, Diarrhea Diseases, and Dengue Fever. In addition to entomology, HIV studies, surveillance and outbreak response under the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) program and risk assessment studies on a number of other infectious diseases that are present in the geographical regions where the laboratories are located. The CONUS laboratories conduct research on Military Operational Medicine, Combat Casualty Care, Diving and Submarine Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Environmental and Occupational Health, Directed Energy, and Aviation Medicine and Human Performance. For the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS), medical research and development programs are divided into five primary thrust areas: Enroute care, Expeditionary Medicine, Operational Medicine (in-garrison care), Force Health Protection (FHP) (detect, prevent, threats), and Human Performance. Expeditionary Medicine is focused on care on the battlefield and in field hospitals prior to transporting patients out of theater to CONUS, and studies trauma resuscitation, hemorrhage control, and other life-saving interventions to keep critically wounded patients alive in the golden hour and to the next level of care. The AFMS is the only service transporting patients on long aeromedical evacuation missions from theater to Landstuhl and from Landstuhl to CONUS. Therefore, the Enroute Care thrust area studies include optimal time for patient transport, cabin altitude, noise, vibration, and environmental issues affecting patient physiology on the aircraft, and the Human Performance thrust area compliments Enroute Care through its studies on medic and aircrew performance on long missions, as well as special operations forces performance. Medical development and biomedical technology investments in FHP seek to deliver an improved FHP capability across the full spectrum of operations with research that prevents injury/illness through improved identification and control of health risks. Under FHP, sub-project areas include: Directed Energy, Occupational and Environmental Health, and Advanced Diagnostics/Therapeutics. Operational medicine is focused on in garrison care - our next most critical issue post OIF/OEF - and how to care for the whole patient and consideration of comorbidities in treatment of wounded warriors and dependents. For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), medical development programs include the Prostate Cancer Center of Excellence (CoE), the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine, and the Pain CoE. The Prostate CoE, formerly a CSI, was chartered in 1992 to conduct basic, clinical, and translational research programs to combat diseases of the prostate. The Center's mission is fulfilled primarily through its three principal programs -- the Clinical Translational Research Center, the Basic Science Research Program, and the Tri-Service Multicenter Prostate Cancer Database, which encompasses its clinical research work with other participating military medical centers. These affiliated sites contribute data and biospecimens obtained from prostate cancer patients who participate in clinical trials. The Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM) brings together the expertise of clinicians and scientists across disciplines to catalyze innovative approaches to traumatic brain injury (TBI) research. CNRM research programs emphasize aspects of high relevance to military populations, with a primary focus on patients at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Beginning in FY15, the Pain CoE funding line is transferred from Army to USUHS.

It will build upon existing funded projects, leveraging investments from the US Government, international partners and non-Government Agencies. In FY15, surveillance efforts started in 2014 will expand to include military personnel, a mobile group working in malaria endemic areas of Vietnam. This population has traditionally been excluded from global malaria control programs and comprehensive malaria burden data is not available. The Vietnamese People's Army Military Medicine Department (MMD) has requested a cross- sectional study be conducted to determine the parasite carriage rate and proportion of drug-resistant parasites within the military. This study is critical to understanding the malaria burden in this segment of the Vietnamese population and is a pre-requisite for additional malaria elimination efforts planned for FY16 and leverage FY14 investments. In FY16, after establishing a baseline parasite carriage rate and drug resistant burden in FY15 for the military, research efforts will focus on improving the quality of detecting individuals carrying the malaria parasite, treatment (the drugs themselves and the adherence to them) and the implementation of rigorous investigation of each case to determine the origin of infection to prevent further infections. The impact of the malaria interventions under study will be evaluated (and re-evaluated) to determine which quality improvement practices should be scaled up or if additional interventions are needed. The most effective combinations of interventions for different epidemiological strata in Vietnam will be determined to select and then directly evaluate the impact of the selected interventions on malaria parasite carriage and disease rates in an on-going iterative fashion (operations research). Collected malaria surveillance and intervention data will be modelled to measure impact of previous interventions in Vietnam. The most promising intervention or combination of interventions will be recommended for deployment for eliminate malaria in the defined geographic region of study in Vietnam.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project seeks to demonstrate that the impact of sepsis (severe infections) in Egypt can be mitigated through the Austere Environment Consortium for Enhanced Sepsis Outcomes (ACESO) approach of discovering common, host-based pathogenic pathways for improved recognition and management of sepsis and point of care (POC) diagnostic and prognostic biomarker panels. Sepsis is the common path to end-organ damage and death for a large proportion of globally-important infectious diseases. This project will improve the understanding of disease pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms through network and biomarker analysis thus offering unique opportunities for improving sepsis diagnosis and management. Insight into the disease pathogenesis of sepsis, and host factors which predict susceptibility, and sepsis severity provides opportunity for targeted interventions to forestall morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, enhanced knowledge of emerging antimicrobial resistance in strategic regions informs ongoing surveillance and mitigation efforts of critical importance to deployed forces. Successful completion of this project will provide reliable antimicrobial resistance data for forces deploying to Egypt and the region and also document improved methods for the treatment and management of sepsis. ACESO is an international consortium of sepsis researchers led by NMRC that has established a network of sepsis research sites in SE Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa to improve clinical outcomes and advance our understanding of pathogenesis, biomarkers of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance trends. The proximity of NAMRU-3 to the largest infectious disease hospital in Egypt (Abbassia Fever Hospital) affords an unparalleled opportunity for ACESO expansion and will provide critical severe infection and antimicrobial resistance data from the important North African Theater. This project supports (both directly and indirectly) Global Health Security Agenda priorities: Prevent Avoidable Epidemics; Detect Threats Early; and Respond Rapidly and Effectively to biological threats of international concern.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project area seeks to deliver improved capabilities across the full spectrum of operations in the areas of Directed Energy and Occupational and Environmental Health. Research in the Directed Energy sub-project area seeks to develop technologies to \"detect to warn\" and \"detect to protect\" AF operators such that they can take appropriate actions to prevent or minimize exposure leading to adverse health effects. Research in the Occupational and Environmental Health sub-project area involves the assessment and implementation of innovative new technologies that enable effective surveillance, detection, identification, and mitigation of hazardous chemical, biological, and physical hazards that present a health risk to our forces and threaten to degrade and disrupt the missions they execute. Air Force FHP efforts focus on health protection across the spectrum of AF air and ground operations. These include hazards presented to high performance and high flyer aircraft crews facing extreme environments within their flight envelopes that are potentially more sensitive to physiologic and cognitive stressors and rely on aircraft systems to provide life support for protection. Because Air Force installations are typically very strategically important in combat execution, they are more often tied to performing ops at fixed locations; therefore, they drive the need to detect and identify the USAF- and environment-specific risks posed by chemical, biological, directed energy, and other radiological and physical hazards immediately and on-site so that operations can be resumed as quickly as possible. This requires enhanced monitoring capability, such as man-portable gold-standard hazard detection. Research is needed to improve these capabilities and to account for emerging threats. The mission needs driving the ability to detect also drives the need to rapidly reduce or mitigate threats once discovered. State of the art detection and monitoring equipment, therefore, is also an important FHP research need. B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project seeks to deliver improved capabilities across the full spectrum of operations in the areas of Directed Energy and Occupational and Environmental Health. Research in the Directed Energy sub-project area seeks to develop technologies to \"detect to warn\" and \"detect to protect\" AF operators such that they can take appropriate actions to prevent or minimize exposure leading to adverse health effects. Research in the Occupational and Environmental Health sub-project area involves the assessment and implementation of innovative new technologies that enable effective surveillance, detection, identification, and mitigation of hazardous chemical, biological, and physical hazards that present a health risk to our forces and threaten to degrade and disrupt the missions they execute. Air Force FHP efforts focus on health protection across the spectrum of AF air and ground operations. These include hazards presented to high performance and high flyer aircraft crews facing extreme environments within their flight envelopes that are potentially more sensitive to physiologic and cognitive stressors and rely on aircraft systems to provide life support for protection. Because Air Force installations are typically very strategically important in combat execution, they are more often tied to performing ops at fixed locations; therefore, they drive the need to detect and identify the USAF- and environment-specific risks posed by chemical, biological, directed energy, and other radiological and physical hazards immediately and on-site so that operations can be resumed as quickly as possible. This requires enhanced monitoring capability, such as man-portable gold-standard hazard detection. Research is needed to improve these capabilities and to account for emerging threats. The mission needs driving the ability to detect also drives the need to rapidly reduce or mitigate threats once discovered. State of the art detection and monitoring equipment, therefore, is also an important FHP research need. B.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2014 FY 2015 FY 2016 with appropriate medical information to inform better decisions. Progress was also made in developing a test environment for electronic health records, allowing developers a robust environment to optimize products before launch to live systems. The military infectious diseases research program funded a multi-year, clinical study for development of an antibacterial drug against multiple drug resistant bacteria to mitigate hard to treat wound infections. A study in humans evaluated safety and effectiveness of a bacteriophage (viruses in bacteria) cocktail against Staphylococcus aureus (a drug-resistant bacteria) with the aim to develop novel skin and soft tissue infection treatment options. An additional study was initiated to reduce surgical site infection rates during complex combat-related wounds, which will help reduce the need for an extended course of systemic antibiotics, irrigation, and surgical debridement. Evaluated effectiveness to detect bacterial infections in wounds aimed to reduce excess empiric antibiotic use while awaiting conventional culture and susceptibility results. Research was initiated on the Next Generation Diagnostic Systems to detect malaria, dengue, and chikungunya. Military operational medicine research is grouped into four portfolios of injury prevention and reduction, psychological health and resilience, physiological health, and environmental health and protection. Injury prevention and reduction developed standards for low level, repetitive blast exposures during breaching (process used to force open closed and/or locked doors), developed performance and musculoskeletal health metrics (pertaining to muscle and bone health)for Warfighters in military training environments, and developed blast and auditory injury models to provide medical injury criteria. Psychological health and resilience evaluated behavioral interventions to treat alcohol and substance abuse, determined the feasibility of cognitive behavioral interventions (a type of therapy that focuses on examining the relationships among thoughts, feelings and behaviors) for the treatment of PTSD, evaluated interventions to build resiliency in military families and Warfighters, and initiated efforts to improve accurate suicide prevention screening and delivery of innovative peer leader-led suicide prevention interventions. Physiological health developed guidelines for nutritional supplementation to minimize injuries during initial military training and developed interventions for dietary and weight loss in Warfighters. Environmental health and performance measured health effects of chemical exposures (e.g., permethrin, an insecticide used to treat uniforms), measured biomarkers of pulmonary health (pertaining to the lungs) from exposures to toxic substances in the deployed environment to assess health and disease outcomes, and developed decision aids for managing thermal physiological strain. Combat casualty care is grouped into portfolios for hemorrhage and resuscitation, neurotrauma, traumatic tissue injury, forward surgical intensive critical care, joint enroute care, and military medical photonics. Hemorrhage and resuscitation developed platelet-derived agents to stop bleeding and modulate immune inflammatory responses, foams to stop internal bleeding, enhanced storage of red blood cells, and low blood volume resuscitation techniques, conducted a clinical trial on using plasma first during resuscitation of traumatic hemorrhages, developed techniques to reduce pathogens in whole blood. Neurotrauma developed biomarkers (substance, such as a protein, indicating the presence of a condition) for TBI, developed a prehospital drug for TBI, conducted a clinical trial on Eye-Trac technology to diagnose and assess TBI, conducted a pivotal clinical trial Volume 1 - 134UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603115HP: Medical Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 73 of 105 R-1 Line #6Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2016 Defense Date: February 2015 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130 / 2R-1 DevelopmentProject 373A / GDF - Medical Technology Development B.

Traumatic tissue injury conducted research on face restoration, orthopedic advances, and compartment syndrome (a life-threatening condition resulting from injury wherein increased pressure occurs within legs or arms). The traumatic tissue injury program also conducted outcomes-related research on genitourinary injury (a follow-up to the basic epidemiology study done earlier, looking at long-term outcomes). Forward surgical intensive critical care conducted a clinical study on a technique using an endovascular (minimally invasive surgery to access regions of the body via major blood vessels) balloon to open occlusions of the aorta in severe pelvic fracture and hemorrhagic shock cases, started research on intensive care interventions with the Joint Trauma System in the US Army Institute of Surgical Research. Joint enroute care conducted research on real-time, physiologic monitoring across the battle space, supported a patient immobilization effort, developed improved field management and safe air transport of patients with head and spine injuries, developed a joint-force aeromedical transport litter immobilization and stabilization platform, and developed an enroute care registry to better track best practices. Military medical photonics developed optical technology for military medical applications with a focus on the use of lasers, spectroscopy, and imaging. Clinical and rehabilitative medicine advanced studies in neuromusculoskeletal injury rehabilitation, pain management, regenerative medicine, and sensory system restoration and rehabilitation after traumatic injury. Extended studies started in FY13 to support development and preclinical evaluations of candidate technologies for restoration and rehabilitation strategies and medical products. In pain management, a pain outcome registry tracked treatment results and created evidence-based clinical guidelines for care, studied the effects of a treatment drug on burn pain, and evaluated methadone and opioid related adverse events. Regenerative medicine initiated clinical studies for craniomaxillofacial intraoral defects (defects within the mouth), immunomodulation strategies for composite tissue allotransplantation (hand and face transplantation), and skin coverage following burn injury. Sensory systems research started studies to verify the prevalence of central auditory processing disorders in blast- exposed Warfighters, evaluated computerized oculomotor (eye motion) vision screening to expedite the diagnosis of TBI-related oculomotor dysfunctions in a military population, studied the effects of blast exposure on the hearing of deployed Navy and Marine Corps personnel, and evaluated cochlear implants to improve hearing for active duty Service members. FY 2015 Plans: Medical simulation and information sciences research program is focusing in two primary research portfolios: Medical simulation and training and health informatics and information technology. Medical simulation and training research is continuing development of an open source virtual tissue advancement model that will be open to developers and end-users, allowing them to focus on content creation into a variety of simulation system tools and for end-users to better validate simulation systems.

The wound infection prevention and management host/pathogen biomarker project, for detection of bacterial infection in wounds, is completing laboratory and initial animal studies to confirm its effectiveness and accuracy. Under antimicrobial countermeasures, clinical studies continue for the development of an antibacterial drug against multiple drug resistant bacteria and to reduce surgical site infection rates that often occur with complex combat-related wounds. Several studies are also being initiated for the development of antibacterial or other wound infection prevention strategies. Military operational medicine research is grouped into four portfolios of injury prevention and reduction, psychological health and resilience, physiological health, and environmental health and protection. Injury prevention and reduction is validating blast and auditory injury models to deliver guidelines for medical injury criteria, validating medical criteria standards for low level, repetitive blast exposures during breaching (process used to force open closed or locked doors), and verifying performance and musculoskeletal health metrics of Service members in military training environments. Psychological health is determining the effectiveness of behavioral interventions to treat alcohol and substance abuse, evaluating cognitive behavioral interventions (a type of therapy that focuses on examining the relationships among thoughts, feelings and behaviors) for the treatment of PTSD, improving interventions to build resiliency in military families and Warfighters, and improving accuracy of suicide prevention screening. Physiological health is evaluating interventions to promote and sustain weight loss in Warfighters and military families, and validating a policy for vitamin supplementation to reduce injuries during operational and training scenarios. Environmental health and performance is validating decision aids for managing thermal physiological work strain (ability to perform work tasks safely in hot environments), determining health outcomes of chemical exposures (e.g., permethrin, an insecticide used to treat uniforms), determining specific biomarkers of pulmonary health (pertaining to the lungs) from exposures to toxic substances in the deployed environment and specific stress response biomarkers of mild and moderate dehydration for assessing hydration status of Warfighters. Combat casualty care is grouped into portfolios for hemorrhage and resuscitation, neurotrauma, traumatic tissue injury, forward surgical intensive critical care, joint enroute care, and military medical photonics. Hemorrhage and resuscitation is conducting clinical assessments of new agents that control severe internal bleeding and can be administered by first responders at or near the point of injury, developing multiple new TBI diagnostic approaches that when used together provide a more comprehensive diagnosis than what is currently available, evaluate ability to control the immune inflammatory response in hemorrhage.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification To better protect mounted warriors from the effects of underbody blast (UBB) caused by landmines or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), the Underbody Blast (UBB) Testing medical research project will provide new data on the biomechanics of human skeletal response that occurs in an attack on a ground combat vehicle. The data will provide a biomedical basis for the development of a Warrior-representative blast test manikin (the Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin or WIAMan project) and the required biomedically-valid injury criteria that can be used in Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation to characterize dynamic events, the risk of injury to mounted warriors, and to support acquisition decisions. This new data will also benefit the overall DoD effort in vehicle and protection technology for the UBB threat. This work is needed to overcome the limitations of the current test manikin and injury criteria which were designed for the civilian automotive industry for frontal crash testing and as such are not adequate in the combat environment. The current manikins do not represent the modern Soldier and were not designed for the vertical acceleration environment associated with UBB events. Consequently, current LFT&E crew survivability assessment methodologies are limited in their ability to predict the types and severity of injuries seen in these events. Due to this technology gap, military ground vehicles are being fielded without fully defined levels of injury risk and crew survivability for UBB events. The data produced by this project will be used to satisfy a critical need for a scientifically valid capability for analyzing the risk of injury caused by UBB. B.

FY 2014 Accomplishments: The Underbody Blast Testing project focused on generating and providing medical research data needed to support the development of the WIAMan anthropomorphic (resembling a human) test device concept and the first generation prototype. The emphasis was on non-injurious testing conditions and biofidelity data but also included injurious testing. All body regions were addressed including whole-body testing and also prioritized testing of the following body regions, foot and ankle, leg, pelvis, lumbar spine, thoracic spine, cervical spine, torso, head and neck. Validation studies were conducted to contrast injuries observed in theater with those created in the testing program to prioritize research.

All data are transitioning into the WIAMan project to enable the fabrication of the first and second generation prototype anthropometric test devices (ATDs; manikins or crash test dummies). Validation studies are contrasting injuries observed in theater with those created in the testing program to prioritize further research. Emerging medical research data are supporting the protection technology development and the modeling and simulation initiatives. FY 2016 Plans: The Underbody Blast Testing project will continue medical research in the areas initiated in FY15 but with the emphasis shifting to perform matched pair testing of the first generation WIAMan prototype. This will enable a pairwise comparison between the human injury probability curves and the responsiveness of the WIAMan first generation prototype in the military and underbody blast environments.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project funds research to develop candidate HIV vaccines, to assess their safety and effectiveness in human subjects, and to protect the military personnel from risks associated with HIV infection. All HIV technology development is conducted in compliance with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Evaluations in human subjects are conducted to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of candidate vaccines, as required by FDA regulation. Studies are conducted stepwise: first, to prove safety; second, to demonstrate the desired effectiveness of the drug, vaccine, or device for the targeted disease or condition in a small study; and third, to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human population trials. All results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This project supports studies for effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of effectiveness testing in larger populations. This program is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement between USAMRMC and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments or other government organizations.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB), the Deployed Warfighter Protection project plans to develop new or improved protection for ground forces from disease-carrying insects. The focus of this program is to develop new or improved systems for controlling insects that carry disease under austere, remote, and combat conditions; understand the physiology of insecticidal activity to develop new compounds with greater specific activity and/or higher user acceptability; examine existing area repellents for efficacy and develop new spatially effective repellent systems useful in military situations; develop new methods or formulations for treating cloth to prevent vector biting; and expand the number of active ingredients and formulations of public health pest pesticides, products and application technologies available for safe, and effective applications. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2014 FY 2015 FY 2016 Title: Deployed Warfighter Protection Description: The Deployed Warfighter Protection project will develop new or improved protection for ground forces from disease- carrying insects. FY 2014 Accomplishments: The Deployed Warfighter Protection (DWFP) research project focused on three major areas to develop products to control biting insects, primarily mosquitoes and sand flies, that transmit force degrading diseases: personal protection systems, new insecticides, and vector control/insecticide application technologies. The personal protection system for today's warfighter relies upon permethrin treated uniforms, applying topical repellents to all exposed skin daily, and sleeping under an insecticide treated net. These countermeasures are often ineffective for several reasons including low user acceptance and the logistical burden of supplying and carrying these products. New personal protection system tools - such as lower concentration repellent chemicals and spatial repellents - were in development by DWFP scientists and their partners. In the area of new insecticides, expanded regulatory requirements and development of insecticide resistance have resulted in a reduction in the number of public health pesticides available for controlling mosquitoes and sand flies. DWFP transitioned a patented Attractive Targeted Sugar Bait (ATSB) delivery technology to a commercial partner as a novel reduced risk pesticide. This new mosquito control product promises to revolutionize mosquito control. To improve the effectiveness and the sustainability of insect control operations in deployed settings, the DWFP focused on developing updated insect control methods, lighter weight insecticide sprayers, and new application technologies that take advantage of engineering advances such as smartphones and robotics.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2014 FY 2015 FY 2016 The Deployed Warfighter Protection (DWFP) research project is developing products that will enable deployed forces to better protect themselves and control biting insects, primarily mosquitoes and sand flies, which transmit force degrading diseases. The DWFP is focusing research efforts on critical gaps identified by the Services and Combatant Commands to control insect disease vectors to provide solutions in three thrust areas: personal protection systems, new insecticides, and vector control/insecticide application technologies. Within the enhanced personal protection systems, DWFP is evaluating the feasibility of bite-proof fabrics, studying the durability of factory permethrin-treated uniforms, and searching for a replacement insecticide that safely outperforms the current treated uniforms. Regarding spatial repellents, the DWFP down-selected and is extensively evaluating a chemical to augment the use of personal topical repellents, such as DEET, which require frequent application, suffer from low levels of user acceptability, and are short lived (lasting only hours). Such a spatial repellent promises to protect personnel when not in uniform and when DEET or other skin repellents are not used. The DWFP is conducting early field tests of prototype micro-dispensers and textile-based area/spatial-repellent dispensers; and conducting a preregistration meeting with the parent commercial company and the EPA to determine steps required for regulatory approval of the repellent in the US. To counter the rising problem of mosquito resistance to existing insecticides and the issue of currently approved insecticides being removed due to more stringent regulatory requirements, the DWFP is focused on developing the next generation of insecticides which will be more effective at protecting deployed personnel while also being safer for humans and the environment. The DWFP is collaborating with multiple industry partners to develop such new insecticides for EPA registration. For vector control technologies, the DWFP is targeting pesticide delivery methods that are more effective, efficient, and sustainable in austere and tropical environments. In addition to materiel solutions/products, DWFP priorities include knowledge products that support vector control and disease risk reduction to include improving current practices used in the field. FY 2016 Plans: In FY16 the Deployed Warfighter Protection (DWFP) research project will develop and field tools that enable deployed forces to better protect themselves and control biting insects, primarily mosquitoes and sand flies, which transmit force degrading diseases. This will be accomplished through research, testing and evaluation of products, patent submissions, licensing, and EPA registrations for new insecticides. The DWFP will maintain its focus within personal protection systems, new insecticides, and vector control/insecticide application technologies. For enhanced personal protection systems, protective clothing efforts will review pending positive results of the FY15 evaluations of prototype bite proof fabric for commercialization; the alternative to permethrin for treating combat uniforms will complete efficacy evaluations and, if effective, will be submitted to the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB) and the EPA for approval and registration. Within this same focus area, under area/spatial repellents the DWFP will expand field tests focused on the best performing area/spatial-repellent dispensers evaluated in FY15 and will work with the EPA and associated industry partner to pursue EPA registration for military use. For new insecticides, the DWFP will down select top performing novel molecular pesticides-tested in FY15 for expanded field testing; will conduct faster, more efficient, lab based screening of potential plant-derived and synthetic insecticides to identify promising candidate compounds; and will execute field evaluations of insecticides identified in FY15.

This portfolio is designed to address areas of interest to the Secretary of Defense related to Wounded Warriors, capabilities identified through the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, and the sustainment of priority investments in science, technology, research, and development, as stated in the Quadrennial Defense Review. Program development and execution is peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all of the Military Services, appropriate Defense agencies or activities, and other federal agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Homeland Security. Coordination occurs through the planning and execution activities of the Defense Health Agency's Joint Program Committees (JPC), which were established to manage research, development, test and evaluation for Defense Health Program (DHP) sponsored research. Research within this program element encompasses Medical Simulation and Information Sciences (through JPC-1), Military Infectious Disease (through JPC-2), Military Operational Medicine (through JPC-5), Combat Casualty Care (through JPC-6), and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine (through JPC-8). As the research efforts mature, the most promising efforts will transition to medical products and support systems development funding, Program Element 0605145. For the Air Force Medical Service, funding in this program element supports technology development for the rapid transition of medical products and capabilities from Air Force laboratories, and the ability to perform modifications /enhancements required to integrate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and near-COTS products into the military operating environment. Ability to enhance or modify existing COTS is a cost effective technique we should maximize where possible, ensuring warfighters have appropriate technology at hand to care for wounded at the point of injury through definitive care and on to rehabilitation and reintegration at the most efficient cost and schedule possible. Significant benefits can be obtained from rapid insertion of high value / impact technologies into healthcare operations to address capabilities that enter the acquisition life-cycle at high TRL levels that can readily be implemented with significant upside potential.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Army Medical Command received PE 0605013 funding to identify, explore, and demonstrate key technologies to overcome medical and military unique technology barriers. Programs include Army service level support for the Army Warrior Care and Transition System (AWCTS), the Medical Operational Data System (MODS), the Workload Management System for Nursing - Internet (WMSNi), the Psychological and Behavioral Health - Tools for Evaluation, Risk, and Management (PBH- TERM), the Multidrug-Resistant Organism Repository and Surveillance Network (MRSN), the Business Intelligence Competency Center (BICC), the Mobile HealthCare Environment (MHCE), the Corporate Dental System (CDS), and the Defense Center of Excellence (DCoE). The Navy Medical Command RDT&E funding supports the development required for those systems which are integral to Navy Medicine (i.e., Navy Medicine Online (NMO)). Navy Medicine also funds, when appropriate, a number of small-scale, opportunistic business improvements when the technology makes a sudden advance. These projects are generally not in the scope of the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) Central Programs such as the development/integration of Defense Optical Fabrication Enterprise Management System (DOFEMS) into a fully automated system to support workload distribution, performance metrics, staffing requirements, supply management, calculation of operating costs from the current independently or manually DOFEMS system. This effort will be a web based centralized management tool and provide a standalone standard set of Lab Management software for all 26 Navy labs. Additionally, the re-design of HIV Management System (HMS) will be more user friendly, less time to perform everyday tasks and prevents the need to maintain separate databases. The re-design will also automate and minimize functions that require manual assistance and assist in fulfilling new requirements.

Data warehousing, reporting services, systems integration, and custom application development are featured in almost all IM/IT systems and application requests. The information needs of the AFMS are growing in volume, complexity, and delivery formats. In order to meet future requirements, aggregation of more and varied data sources require increasingly complex data warehousing capabilities. Demand for dynamic analytic capability will require investments in business intelligence, predictive analytic tools, open source research data models, and emerging personalized medicine analysis. Information is still largely produced in an ad hoc manner without standard methodologies, mapping of business requirements, transparent analytic models, and distributed by office productivity software. Centralized production of standard reports, balance sheets, and dynamic query tools would relieve many managers and action officer of routine work and increase leadership decision support. AFMS medical readiness reporting and tracking has set the standard in the DoD for over a decade but multiple applications now encompass what has merged into a common process of tracking unit capability and personal health assessments. Consolidation of medical readiness applications would streamline disability, medical readiness, deployment surveillance, and flying status tracking and reporting who currently must move between multiple applications. For the Air Force, the funding in this program element provides for sustainment of the IM/IT Test Bed (IMIT-TB) capability, which is a dedicated OT location and staff encompassing the entire spectrum of healthcare services and products available in MTFs, to provide risk controlled testing of designated core and interim medical applications in a live environment. Military Health System (MHS) Health Information Technology (HIT) [previously known as Tri-Service IM/IT] - HIT activities include: Innovation and Advanced Technology; Infrastructure & Operations; Solution Delivery; Information Delivery; Cyber Security; and Portfolio Management and Customer Relations. RDT&E program includes funding for development/integration, modernization, test and evaluation for the Defense Health Agency initiatives, and any special interest that are shared within all components of the Defense Health Program (DHP), excluding the Integrated Electronic Health Record, Defense Medical Information Exchange and the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization Program (DHMSM). The DHP RDT&E appropriation includes the following TMA initiatives: Electronic Commerce System (E-Commerce): This system was developed for centralized collection, integration, and reporting of accurate purchased care contracting and financial data. It provides an integrated set of data reports from multiple data sources to management, as well as tools to control the end-to-end program change management process. E-Commerce is composed of several major applications including: Contract Management (CM), utilizing Prism software to support contract action development and documentation; Resource Management (RM), employing Oracle Federal Financials and TED interface software to support the budgeting, accounting, case recoupment, and disbursement processes; Document Management, utilizing Document software to provide electronic storage, management, and retrieval of contract files; Management Tracking and Reporting, utilizing custom software to provide reports to assist in the management and tracking of changes to the managed care contracts as well as current and out year liabilities; the Purchased Care and Contractor's Resource Center web sites that provide up-to-date financial information for both TMA and the Services concerning the military treatment facilities (MTFs), and expenditures for MTF enrollee purchased care and supplemental care. E-Commerce includes an infrastructure of over 60 servers supporting development, test, and production. E-Commerce is employed by several hundred users in more than 7 different organizations. Project oversight and coordination must be provided to ensure that the needs of the disparate organizations are met without influencing system performance or support to any individual user. Server configurations must remain current with respect to security policies, user authorizations, and interactions with other systems and functions. All of these activities must be managed and coordinated on a daily basis.

The VTA is scheduled to sun-set, by VA (Veterans Affairs), and the data is being moved to another application. Migration of VTA to another application creates the requirement to allow data exchange between Service non-medical case management and new VA DES (Disability Evaluation System) IT application. The BEC (Benefits Executive Council) is looking to create a DMS (Disability Mediation Service), which is an integrator between the Services and VA. The DMS will facilitate the improvement of non-medical case management tracking and IDES data/information management. It will eliminate redundant data entry within DoD (Department of Defense), improving data quality by capturing more data for operational reporting from the Services and WCP, decrease backlog by eliminating data entry duplication, and minimize impact to DoD Services by allowing the Services to continue using their existing/planned systems without requiring retraining on a new applications. The DMS will be created from existing technology. It will provide a mediation service to help isolate each system from changes and uniqueness in the other systems and allow the Services and WCP to report and drill down on data that we capture during the exchange. This IT solution will not replace current DoD systems, but will require some modifications and enhancements to those systems to support the date exchange. WCP will support development costs for these efforts. Services will assume responsibility and POM costs for modifications, enhancements, and maintenance in the out years.\" B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification DMLSS provides the Military Medical Departments one standard Department of Defense (DoD) medical logistics system. The DMLSS suite of applications provides the healthcare driven capability to support the medical logistics needs of the DoD community for critical medical commodities - pharmaceuticals and medical/surgical supplies across the continuum of care from the battlefield to tertiary care at a major DoD military treatment facility (MTF). This capability is enabled by the partnership of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Defense Supply Center Philadelphia and the Military Health System (MHS) providing an industry to practitioner supply chain for the medical commodity. The DMLSS Defense Logistics Agency Wholesale (DMLSS-W) applications are funded by Defense Logistics Agency while the garrison medical treatment facilities and theater applications are funded by the Defense Health Program. The current DMLSS system provides full spectrum capability for medical logistics management. Basic functionality includes stock control, Prime Vendor operations, preparation of procurement documents, research and price comparison for products, property accounting, biomedical maintenance operations, capital equipment, property management, inventory, and a facility management application that supports the operations of a fixed medical treatment facility physical plant and supports Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) accreditation requirements. DMLSS, in coordination with the Theater Medical Information Program - Joint (TMIP-J), is providing to the Services and the Combatant Commanders the functional logistics capabilities necessary to rapidly project and sustain joint medical capabilities for medical logistics management of theater medical materiel operations. Current products deployed to the theater include the DMLSS Customer Assistance Module (DCAM), a medical logistics ordering tool that allows users to view their supplier's catalog and generate electronic orders. Primarily focused on the theater environment, DCAM automates the Class VIII supply process at the lower levels of care, and allows non-logisticians, who maintain their medical supplies as an additional duty, to electronically exchange catalog, order, and status information with their supply activity.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification In March 2008, the MHS embarked upon Electronic Health Record (EHR) modernization planning, establishing the initial Electronic Health Records Way Ahead (EHRWA). In March 2011, the Program was expanded to include the VA in a joint initiative to implement a new, integrated electronic health record for both Departments, called the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program. Secretary Hagel's Memorandum titled \"Integrated Electronic Health Records,\" dated May 2013, provided additional direction to the program: DoD shall continue near-term coordinated efforts with VA to develop data federation, presentation, and interoperability. This near-term goal shall be pursued as a first priority separately from the longer-term goal of health record information technology (IT) modernization. DoD shall pursue a full and open competition for a core set of capabilities for EHR modernization. To fulfill Secretary Hagel's directive, parallel programs have been defined, splitting the original iEHR program into two distinct areas.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification In March 2008, the MHS embarked upon Electronic Health Record (EHR) modernization planning, establishing the initial Electronic Health Records Way Ahead (EHRWA). In March 2011, the Program was expanded to include the VA in a joint initiative to implement a new, integrated electronic health record for both Departments, called the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program. Secretary Hagel's Memorandum titled \"Integrated Electronic Health Records,\" dated May 2013, provided additional direction to the program: DoD shall continue near-term coordinated efforts with VA to develop data federation, presentation, and interoperability. This near-term goal shall be pursued as a first priority separately from the longer-term goal of health record information technology (IT) modernization. DoD shall pursue a full and open competition for a core set of capabilities for EHR modernization. To fulfill Secretary Hagel's directive, parallel programs have been defined, splitting the original iEHR program into two distinct areas. In the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) Acquisition Decision Memoranda (ADM), dated June 21, 2013 and January 2, 2014, the former joint DoD and VA Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program was restructured to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program and a newly defined iEHR focused on providing seamless integrated sharing of electronic health data between the DoD and VA to be called Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX).

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification DHMSM will acquire and support deployment, and implementation of an electronic health record (EHR) system that replaces the DoD legacy MHS inpatient and outpatient EHR systems. Overarching goal of the program is to enable healthcare teams to deliver high-quality, safe care and preventive services to patients through the use of easily accessible standards-based computerized patient records resulting in: improved accuracy of diagnoses and medication; improved impact on health outcomes; increased patient participation in the healthcare process; improved patient-centered care coordination; and increased practice efficiencies in all settings, including operational environments. DHMSM replaces DoD legacy healthcare systems with a commercial solution in use in other medical systems that is open, rendered as a modular architecture, using standards-based/non-proprietary interfaces. DHMSM will support the Department's goals of net centricity by providing a framework for full human and technical connectivity and interoperability that allows DoD users and mission partners to share the information they need, when they need it, in a form they can understand and act on with confidence, and protects information from those who should not have it. Once fielded, the EHR will support the following healthcare activities for DoD's 44,000 practitioners and 9.5 million beneficiaries. 1. Clinical workflow and provider clinical decision support; 2. Capture, maintain, use, protect, preserve and share health data and information; 3. Retrieval and presentation of health data and information that is meaningful for EHR users regardless of where the patient's records are physically maintained; and 4. Analysis and management of health information from multiple perspectives to include population health, military medical readiness, clinical quality, disease management, and medical research. B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The primary goal of the VLER Health initiative is to enable the secure sharing of health information (i.e., demographic and clinical data) between DoD and external Federal and private sector partners which meets Meaningful Use (MU) requirements to improve healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency. By electronically sharing health information using national standards, that information can support tracking key clinical conditions, communicating that information to better coordinate care, and engaging patients in their own care. The VLER Health initiative provides clinicians with the most up-to-date information, potentially reducing redundant diagnostic tests, medical errors, paperwork and handling, and overall healthcare costs. These benefits, in turn, align with the MHS quadruple aim by ensuring that the military force is medically ready to deploy; the military beneficiary population remains healthy through focused prevention; patient care is convenient, equitable, safe, and of the highest quality; and the total cost of healthcare is reduced through the reduction of waste and focus on quality B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Theater Medical Information Program - Joint (TMIP-J) integrates components of the Military Health System sustaining base systems and the Services medical information systems to ensure timely interoperable medical support for mobilization, deployment and sustainment of all Theater and deployed forces in support of any mission. TMIP-J enhances the clinical care and information capture at all levels of care in Theater, transmits critical information to the Theater Commander, the evacuation chain for combat and non-combat casualties, and forges the theater links of the longitudinal health record to the sustaining base and the Department of Veterans Affairs. TMIP-J is the medical component of the Global Combat Support System. TMIP-J provides information at the point of care and to the Theater tactical and strategic decision makers through efficient, reliable data capture, and data transmission to a centralized Theater database. This delivers TMIP-J\u00b4s four pillars of information support through the electronic health record, integrated medical logistics, patient movement and tracking, and medical command and control through data aggregation, reporting and analysis tools for trend analysis and situational awareness. TMIP-J fulfills the premise of \"Train as you fight\" through the integration of components which are identical or analogous to systems from the sustaining base. TMIP-J adapts and integrates these systems to specific Theater requirements and assures their availability in the no- and low- communications settings of the deployed environment through store and forward capture and transmission technology. Operational Medicine Support (OpMedSpt):Due to the unique nature of the operational environment, the Military Health System must modernize the following capabilities: medical command and control (MC2); medical situational awareness (MSA) (aggregation of operational medical data at a classified level, denying the enemy access to data which could reveal operational plans); Defense blood management; assemblage management; and data interoperability with the pending EHR solution and operational allies. The clinical needs of the operational community are to be met by the pending EHR solution, but there are functional needs, outside the capture of clinical data, to inform decision making regarding the ability of the MHS to meet the needs of the medically ready force, to support the joint warfighter and share data with line systems. It will support mission delivery and execution through the maximization of information technologies, driving standards compliance to ensure non-EHR capabilities will effectively consume the data created through the use of the pending EHR solution in the operational environment, and to allow the solution to share data with these other capabilities, eliminating the need for one to one interfaces, their limitations and cost. Along with the need to modernize those non-clinical capabilities, this enterprise's risk mitigation strategy also supports ongoing missions and clinical needs in the operational environment until sufficient testing of pending solutions can be accomplished in environments indicative of the operational environments, tactical, mobile and dismounted.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification In March 2008, the MHS embarked upon Electronic Health Record (EHR) modernization planning, establishing the initial Electronic Health Records Way Ahead (EHRWA). In March 2011, the Program was expanded to include the VA in a joint initiative to implement a new, integrated electronic health record for both Departments, called the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program. Secretary Hagel's Memorandum titled \"Integrated Electronic Health Records,\" dated May 2013, provided additional direction to the program: DoD shall continue near-term coordinated efforts with VA to develop data federation, presentation, and interoperability. This near-term goal shall be pursued as a first priority separately from the longer-term goal of health record information technology (IT) modernization. DoD shall pursue a full and open competition for a core set of capabilities for EHR modernization. To fulfill Secretary Hagel's directive, parallel programs have been defined, splitting the original iEHR program into two distinct areas. In the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) Acquisition Decision Memoranda (ADM), dated June 21, 2013 and January 2, 2014, the former joint DoD and VA Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program was restructured to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program and a newly defined iEHR focused on providing seamless integrated sharing of electronic health data between the DoD and VA to be called Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX). The remaining iEHR Increment 1 (iEHR Inc 1) was significantly de-scoped to only the Medical Single Sign-on/Context management (MSSO/CM) implemented at James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (JAL FHCC). iEHR RDT&E is reported under the program element (PE) 0605013 through FY 2013 inclusive, but iEHR, VLER Health and DHMSM will be reported under new program element 0605023 for FY 2014. In FY 2015, PE 0605023 will report only iEHR and VLER Health since DHMSM will have its own PE starting in FY 2015. Volume 1 - 287UNCLASSIFIED PE 0605039HP: PE 0605039HP / DoD Medical Information E...

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification DMIX program will acquire the capabilities necessary to securely and reliably exchange standardized, normalized, and correlated health data with all partners through standard data/information exchange mechanisms. This allows users in different places and different organizations to access, use, and supplement health data (technical interoperability) that has a shared meaning so users (assisted by computers) are able to make care decisions (Semantic Interoperability - Level 4). DMIX manages the data exchange capability from legacy data stores in order to prepare for the transition to the modernized Electronic Health Record platform being acquired by DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM). DMIX consists of a family of capability initiatives supporting the seamless exchange of standardized health data among DoD, VA, other Federal agencies, and private providers as well as benefits administrators. The DMIX program provides the capability for health care providers to access and view complete and accurate patient health records from a variety of data sources thereby allowing healthcare providers to make faster and higher quality care decisions. DMIX was established in accordance with the joint memo from USD(C) and USD(AT&L) titled \"Joint Memorandum on Major Defense Acquisition Program and Major Automated Information System Program Resource Transparency in Department of Defense Budget Systems\" dated June 27, 2013. In addition, Joint Electronic Health Record Interoperability (JEHRI) and Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Health (to include Exchange (Query and retrieve \"Pull\" methodology), and Direct (Point to Point \"Push\") transport mechanisms), are part of the DMIX program as a direct result of the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed January 2, 2014 by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistic (USD AT&L). Use of the health data may be done via legacy systems, clinical mobile applications and system agnostic viewers such as the Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV). Customers include the MHS, VA, other federal agencies and over 200,000 medical care practitioners. B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Outside of the Continental United States (OCONUS) Laboratory Infrastructure Support provides management support for research infrastructure at selected overseas laboratories and research sites that conduct biosurveillance and basic to late-stage clinical research and evaluation of investigational products, such as biologics, drugs, protectants, technologies, and knowledge products to treat/prevent infectious diseases for the purpose of protecting the Warfighter; this is accomplished through collaborative efforts with the respective host nation governments. These sites are the US Army Medical Research Unit-Kenya (USAMRU-K) in Nairobi, Kenya, the US Army Medical Research Unit-Georgia (USAMRU-G) in Tbilisi, Georgia, and the US Army Medical Component-Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (USAMC-AFRIMS) in Bangkok, Thailand. USAMRU-G is the newest laboratory, and is being established to provide support in the Caucasus region, similar to that provided by the laboratories in Kenya and Thailand to East Africa and Southeast Asia regions. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2014 FY 2015 FY 2016 Title: OCONUS Laboratory Infrastructure Support (Army) Description: Management support for research infrastructure at selected overseas laboratories and research sites is integral to support the development and testing of improved means of predicting, detecting, preventing, and treating infectious disease threats to the US military, as well as support for surveillance, training, research, and response activities for emerging infectious disease threats that could affect Service Members in those regions. FY 2014 Accomplishments: Funding was applied to existing OCONUS infrastructure requirements at the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) in Thailand, the US Army Research Unit-Kenya (USAMRU-K), and the US Army Medical Research Unit- Georgia (USAMRU-G) laboratories. Infrastructure sustainment costs consisted of the administrative functions and infrastructure support at the three laboratory sites, which support medical research and development of products such as biologics, drugs, protectants, technologies, and knowledge products to treat/prevent military-relevant endemic diseases. At USAMRU-G, funding was used to establish a new laboratory platform at the direction of the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF). FY 2015 Plans: Infrastructure funding costs for AFRIMS and USAMRU-K laboratory support consists of administration and infrastructure support, which supports medical research and development of products such as biologics, drugs, and protectants, technologies, and knowledge products to treat/prevent military-relevant endemic diseases. Infrastructure funding for the Republic of Georgia laboratory further facilitates the establishment of this unit, as directed by the DEPSECDEF.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, this program element (PE) includes funds for the Medical Biological Defense research sub-function of the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) Biological Defense Research Directorate (BDRD) that relocated to Fort Detrick, Maryland under the Base Re-Alignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission 2005. Consequently, there are significant increases in the operational costs by virtue of being at Fort Detrick, a highly secure National Interagency Biodefense Campus (NIBC). Uninterrupted utilities to all buildings on NIBC are provided by a Central Utility Plant (CUP) whose capacity all partners on the NIBC are required to buy into. The annual projected costs are distributed amongst the partners based on square feet and number of occupants of the building. The NIBC campus is a fenced physical location with Entry Control Points (ECP). The partners on the campus are required to pay for the guard force manning their ECP. BDRD's ECP is ECP5 and the projected costs for the guard force. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2014 FY 2015 FY 2016 Title: NMRC Biological Defense Research Directorate (BDRD) (Navy) Description: Biological Defense Research is a completely reimbursable program. The program is sustained by competitive acquisition of research funding. The research dollars cannot pay for the increased operational costs of the program. The complete reimbursable nature of the program requires additional sustained core funding for its operational costs. FY 2014 Accomplishments: A significant amount of funding was used for increased costs related to the Central Utility Plant, Entry Control Point Security Force, and other operational costs for maintenance, refuse, and custodial requirements. These support functions enabled BDRD to meet its mission to protect the Warfighter from biological threat agents through the development and distribution of BW (Biological Warfare) agent detection assays, therapeutics, forensic analysis, and operation of deployable BW agent detection labs.

Description of Operations Supported: Provides resources needed to fund the incremental (above baseline) costs in support of Operation FREEDOM'S SENTINEL (OFS), Operation INHERENT RESOLVE (OIR), European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) and Post\u00adOperation NEW DAWN Activities in FY 2016. The resource amounts provided are consistent with the President's direction to narrow the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and complete a responsible drawdown to 5,500 by the end of calendar year (CY) 2015 and further drawdown to an embassy security presence by the end of CY 2016. The resource amounts provided also support the operation to eliminate the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), responding to terrorist threats and reassuring NATO partners. These incremental funds provide medical and dental services to active forces, mobilized Reserve Components (RC), and their family members in support of these operations. The Defense Health Program (DHP) baseline budget request does not fund the medical and dental support requirements within the Area of Responsibility (AOR). Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds incremental costs associated with the treatment of combat casualties at Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Combat casualties require higher resource intensive care (e.g., amputees, burn and rehabilitative care) than routine peacetime patients require. Other DHP operational requirements in support of these operations includes: Pre/Post deployment processing for personnel, aeromedical transportation of casualties from Germany to the U.S., and contracted/civilian medical personnel to backfill deployed permanent MTF staff. Additionally, support requirements include command, control, and communication (C3) costs, telemedicine for theater care, public health support, material management control, and bioenvironmental health support that are above the baseline budget. The DHP also performs post deployment health assessments (between 3\u00ad6 months after deployment), evaluations, and treatment for all mobilized RC and their family members.

Financial Summary Total DHP OCO ($ in Thousands) FY 2014 ActualsFY 2015 Request A.Subactivity 352,166 65,902 65,149 Narrative Justification : FY 2016 request is less as it assumes an In\u00adCountry troop presence in Afghanistan needed to support OFS, OIR, ERI and Post\u00adOperation NEW DAWN Activities. In addition, smaller projections for deployed active and reserve component forces in FY 2016 contribute to a reduction in the overall requirement. There is a decrease in the FY 2016 requirement for Medical Backfill due to a reduction in force deployment and support activities. As long as there are deployed personnel supporting these continuing operations, the DHP will continue to incur costs associated with supplying pharmaceuticals, pre\u00addeployment individual equipment items (e.g., eyewear and protective mask eyewear inserts) and prophylactic vaccinations. Additionally, the DHP funds incremental funding requirements for casualty care activities at amputee centers at San Antonio Military Medical Center, San Antonio, TX; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD; and Naval Medical Center, San Diego, CA. Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance OCO Operation and Maintenance Detail Exhibit OP\u00ad5, OCO Operation and Maintenance Detail DHP\u00ad224Impact if not funded: Providing health care for military members (active as well as mobilized RC members) is the mission of the Military Health System. This request is for the funding necessary to continue to provide the additional incremental medical and dental care for the mobilized forces not funded in the baseline budget. Without these additional funds, MTFs would have to reduce care to non\u00adactive duty beneficiaries (retirees and family members) resulting in a disengagement of these beneficiaries to the private sector. If funding is not provided to backfill the MTF positions vacated by active duty medical personnel deployed in support of these operations, fewer beneficiaries can be seen in these MTFs thereby shifting health care to the private sector. Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance OCO Operation and Maintenance Detail Exhibit OP\u00ad5, OCO Operation and Maintenance Detail DHP\u00ad225 ($ in Thousands) FY 2014 ActualsFY 2015 EnactedFY 214,259 192,210 Narrative Justification: FY 2016 request is less as it assumes a smaller number of mobilizations in support of OFS, OIR, ERI and Post\u00adOperation NEW DAWN Activities. OCO PSC funding provides mobilized RC personnel and their family members with healthcare, pharmacy, and dental benefits while they are mobilized in support of OCO. Mobilized RC personnel and their family members are eligible for medical and dental care similar to active duty personnel, including access to private sector providers through the TRICARE Managed Care Support Networks. The TRICARE network also provides access to civilian providers for those beneficiaries living in remote locations outside the established network areas. The TRICARE Reserve Select program, offered to RC members who enroll and share premiums with the government, is not included in this requirement. Health care coverage includes costs for medical care and pharmaceuticals for RC personnel and their family members, managed care contract administration fees, and RC dental care (funded here and in In\u00adHouse Care). Impact if not funded: Providing health care to mobilized RC personnel and their families is congressionally mandated. This is a must pay bill and the cost will incur even without funding. If this occurs, other healthcare requirements will be compromised as funding is shifted from other priorities. This may include curtailing the amount of medical treatment obtained in MTFs for non\u00adactive duty personnel, thereby shifting those costs to the private sector care contracts.Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance OCO Operation and Maintenance Detail Exhibit OP\u00ad5, OCO Operation and Maintenance Detail DHP\u00ad226($ in Thousands) FY 2014 ActualsFY 2015 EnactedFY 2016 Request C.Subactivity Group Health Support 56,949 15,311 9,460 Narrative Justification: FY 2016 request is less as it assumes an In\u00adCountry troop presence in Afghanistan needed to support OFS, OIR, ERI and Post\u00adOperation NEW DAWN Activities. In addition, smaller projections for deployed active and reserve component forces in FY 2016 contribute to a reduction in the overall requirement. As long as there are deployed personnel supporting these continuing operations, the DHP will continue to incur costs associated with aeromedical transportation of casualties from Germany to the U.S.; military public health manpower, supplies, and support equipment for disease prevention and control; and incremental support for these operations in epidemiology, medical entomology, drinking water safety, monitoring hazardous waste disposal, food and facility sanitation, deployment health promotion and education, health surveillance, medical intelligence, disease and climate illness training to deploying troops, disease surveillance and control, and injury/high risk mitigation surveillance. Impact if not funded: Lack of funding for collection, documentation, analysis, feedback, and storage of critical patient medical surveillance data sets would cause medical data integrity issues similar to the Vietnam Conflict Agent Orange exposure tracking and follow\u00adup medical care issues. In addition, the optical fabrication and aeromedical transport missions would require further internal offsets. This would lead to reduced efficiencies in infrastructure improvements, hiring of civilian personnel, and the delay or cancellation of non\u00ademergency logistic procurements.Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance OCO Operation and Maintenance Detail Exhibit OP\u00ad5, OCO Operation and Maintenance Detail DHP\u00ad227($ in Thousands) FY 2014 ActualsFY 2015 EnactedFY 2016 Request D.Subactivity Group and Training 10,501 5,059 5,885 Narrative Justification: FY 2016 request assumes an In\u00adCountry troop presence in Afghanistan needed to support OFS, OIR, ERI and Post\u00adOperation NEW DAWN Activities. Requested funding is in support of continued Pre\u00adPost Deployment requirements to support these continuing operations based on estimated fill rates for classes military personnel are required to take prior to deployment. In addition, the DHP will continue to provide the additional trauma training to ensure medical providers receive and retain the necessary skill sets to treat combat trauma injuries as well as training to properly diagnose pre/post deployment mental health conditions. Impact if not funded: Without funding, the proficiency of medical personnel in treating the types of combat injuries that regular day\u00adto\u00adday peacetime healthcare typically does not afford would be greatly diminished. Without pre\u00addeployment training, valuable time in the field would be devoted to elevating medical skills to proper readiness levels. In addition, specialized training to identify and treat pre/post deployment mental illnesses would not be available, therefore causing the possible deployment of non\u00adready forces.
