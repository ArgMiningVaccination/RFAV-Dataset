As a grandfathered plan, PEBA will be able to minimize the increase in State Health Plan premiums while it assesses the future financial impact of the act. As permitted by the Affordable Care Act, a grandfathered health plan can preserve certain basic health coverage that was already in effect when the law was enacted. Being a grandfathered health plan means that the plan may not include certain consumer protections of the ACA that apply to other plans, for example, the requirement for the provision of preventive health services without any cost sharing. However, grandfathered health plans must comply with certain other consumer protections in the ACA, such as the elimination of lifetime limits on benefits. Questions regarding which protections apply and which protections do not apply to a grandfathered health plan and what might cause a plan to change from grandfathered health plan status can be directed to PEBA at 803.737.6800 , 888.260.9430 or online at www.eip.sc.gov. You may also contact the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services at www.healthcare.gov.5 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016General informationGENERAL INFORMATION6 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016We know that your benefits are important to you and to your family. We also know that you lead busy lives, and it can be hard to find time to read complicated insurance materials. For that reason, we continually try to make the Insurance Benefits Guide easier to understand and use. The \"What's new for 2016?\" section on Page 7 highlights major changes in insurance benefits offered for 2016 through the South Carolina Public Employee Benefit Authority (PEBA). Every year there are changes in your insurance benefits. To avoid mistakes, please recycle your 2015 Insurance Benefits Guide and use this 2016 edition. Below are changes to this guide: The Medicare chapter has been removed. In its place, you will find a section in the Retirement and Disability chapter about the circumstances under which you could become eligible for Medicare. For more detailed information about how PEBA's plans work with Medicare, see the When You Become Eligible for Medicare handbook, which is available online and from PEBA. The State Health Plan Medicare Prescription Drug Program has been replaced by Express Scripts Medicare \u00ae. The term life insurance offered through PEBA is underwritten by Minnesota Life, a Securian Financial Group Affiliate. The company is now referred to as \"Securian\" in the Insurance Benefits Guide and other PEBA material. \"No-Pay Copay,\" formerly known as the Generic Copay Waiver program, is now the name of PEBA's program that waives generic copayments for drugs that treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol, congestive heart failure and diabetes. Diabetes supplies also are covered. As always, this guide includes explanations of benefits, premiums and contact information, and provides you with an overview of the insurance programs offered through PEBA. Please remember only information concerning those benefits for which you are eligible and programs under which you are covered applies to you. We encourage you to read each chapter that applies to you and to discuss your benefits with your family. Pay close attention to copayments, deductibles, preauthorization requirements and services that may be limited or not covered. For a detailed explanation of your benefits, check the appropriate chapter in this guide. If you still have questions, contact your benefits administrator. For information about processing and payment of claims, contact the claims processor, such as BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina. Contact information is available on Page 213 of this guide. PEBA is your insurance provider The State Health Plan, which includes the Savings Plan, the Standard Plan and the Medicare Supplemental Plan, is self-insured. As the provider of a self-insured plan, PEBA does not pay premiums to an insurance company. Subscribers' premiums and employers' contributions are placed in a trust fund set up by the state to pay claims and administrative costs. Only about 4 percent of the funds collected as premiums go toward INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 20167 GENERAL INFORMATIONadministrative costs. PEBA contracts with BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, Express Scripts and Companion Benefit Alternatives to process State Health Plan claims and administer some parts of the plan. PEBA determines the benefits you receive and is financially responsible for their cost. When you use your health insurance wisely, you help keep costs low for yourself and for other people insured by the plan. What's new for 2016? Changes listed below are effective January 1, 2016 General All employees who are eligible for health coverage are offered all insurance benefits that were previously only offered to full-time permanent employees. For eligibility details, see Pages 8-9. State Health Plan Express Scripts is the new pharmacy benefits manager for the State Health Plan. Learn more about prescription drug coverage on Pages 67-72. The $12 office visit copay is waived for Standard Plan subscribers who receive care at a provider in BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina's Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) network. Additionally, coinsurance is 10 percent, rather than 20 percent, for care received at a PCMH for Standard and Savings Plan subscribers. For details on PCMHs, see Page 40. PEBA Perks are value-based benefits that are offered at no cost to members at network providers whose primary coverage is the SHP. The benefits available through PEBA Perks include diabetes education, colonoscopies, adult vaccinations and tobacco cessation. We will also continue to offer the benefits included in the Free in '15 initiative as part of PEBA Perks in 2016. Those benefits include preventive screenings, No-Pay Copay (formerly known as Generic Copay Waiver program), shingles vaccines and flu vaccines. Learn more about PEBA Perks on Page 2. Contraceptives covered by the SHP are provided at no cost to subscribers and covered spouses. Details are available on Page 56. MoneyPlus An employee is no longer required to complete one year of PEBA insurance-covered service by January 1 after October enrollment to establish a Medical Spending Account. All Medical Spending Account and Limited-use Medical Spending Account enrollees receive a myFBMC Card\u00ae at no charge. Your insurance benefits: Help when you need it most Your insurance, offered through the South Carolina Public Employee Benefit Authority (PEBA), provides a financial safety net when you are ill or injured. This chapter describes how to enroll in insurance coverage when you begin work for a state-covered employer. It also provides information that may be useful to anyone covered by any insurance plan PEBA GENERAL INFORMATION8 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016offers. Eligibility An employee Works for the state, a higher education institution, a public school district or a participating local subdivision and Receives compensation from the state, a higher education institution, a public school district or a participating local subdivision. Eligible employees also include clerical and administrative employees of the S.C. General Assembly; judges in the state courts; and General Assembly members. Permanent part-time teachers, working between 30 hours a week and 15 hours a week, qualify for state health, vision and dental insurance. However, teachers working between 15 and 30 hours each week are not eligible for other PEBA benefits, such as life and disability insurance. Elected members of participating county and city councils whose members are eligible to participate in one of the retirement systems administered by PEBA are considered full-time employees. Generally, members of other governing boards are not eligible for coverage. If you work for more than one participating group, contact your benefits administrator for further information. Types of employeesEmployees fall into these categories: New full-time employees, who are expected by the employer to work at least 30 hours a week. Therefore, they are eligible for coverage within 31 days of their hire date. New variable-hour, part-time or seasonal employees, who are not expected by their employer to average 30 hours a week during the first 12 months they are employed. Because their employer cannot determine their eligibility, they may not enroll in benefits immediately. Their employer must measure their hours to determine whether these employees work an average of 30 hours a week during the 12 months beginning the first of the month after the employee is hired. If the employee works an average of 30 hours a week during this period, the employee is eligible for coverage during the 12-month period that follows. Ongoing employees, who have worked for their employer from October 4, 2014 - October 3, 2015, a period in which their employer measured their work hours. If the ongoing employee worked an average of 30 hours a week during this 12-month period, the employee is eligible for coverage during 2016, even if the employee's hours decrease during 2016. If the ongoing employee worked an average of less than 30 hours a week during this period, the employee is not eligible for coverage during 2016, unless the employee gains coverage through some other provision of the plan. Benefits-eligible employees may enroll in Health insurance - the State Health Plan Savings Plan and Standard Plan and, for eligible members of the military community, the TRICARE Supplement Plan. Members enrolled in the Savings Plan are eligible for a Health Savings Account. State Dental Plan and Dental Plus State Vision PlanINSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 20169 GENERAL INFORMATION Basic, Optional and Dependent Life insurance Basic and Supplemental Long Term Disability insurance Dependent Care Spending Account Medical Spending Account or a Limited-use Medical Spending Account Premiums may be paid through the Pretax Group Insurance Premium Feature. If an employee's dependents meet other eligibility requirements, they also may be covered. If you have questions about how your eligibility for benefits is affected by the Affordable Care Act, contact your benefits administrator. For information about options for permanent, nonpermanent, seasonal and variable-hour employees who lose coverage, see Pages 25-28. An eligible retiree An individual may be eligible for health, dental and vision coverage in retirement if: 1. He retires from an employer that participates in the state insurance program. 2. He is eligible to retire when he leaves employment. 3. His last five years of employment were served consecutively in a full-time, permanent position with an employer that participates in the state insurance program. For insurance purposes, a member of a retirement system administered by PEBA must meet the minimum retirement eligibility requirements established by the system in which he participated when he left covered employment. Retirement systems administered by PEBA include South Carolina Retirement System (SCRS), Police Officers Retirement System (PORS), General Assembly Retirement System (GARS), Judges and Solicitors Retirement System (JSRS) and the State Optional Retirement Program (State ORP). Please note: This is a brief summary of retiree insurance eligibility requirements. For detailed information, see Pages 161-165. An eligible spouse Is a spouse, as defined by South Carolina law A former spouse who is required to be covered by a divorce decree. You may cover your current spouse or your former spouse, but you cannot cover both spouses under any PEBA insurance program. A spouse eligible for coverage as an employee of any participating group, including a local subdivision, or as a state-funded retiree, may not be covered as a spouse under any plan. A spouse who is a permanent, part-time teacher may be covered as an employee or as a spouse, but not as both. A spouse who is a non-funded retiree may be covered as a retiree or as a spouse, but not as both. An eligible child Must be younger than age 26 Must be the subscriber's natural child, adopted child (including child placed for legal adoption), stepchild, foster child, a child for whom the subscriber has legal custody or a child the subscriber is required to cover due to a court order.GENERAL INFORMATION10 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016A foster child is a child placed by an authorized placement agency with the subscriber, who is a licensed foster parent. A child for whom the subscriber has legal custody is a child for whom the subscriber has guardianship responsibility, not merely financial responsibility, according to a court order or other document filed with the courts. If you and your spouse are both eligible for coverage, only one of you can cover your children under any one plan. However, one parent can cover the children under health, and the other can cover the children under dental. A child age 19 to age 25According to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, a child age 19-25 does not need to be certified as a full-time student or an incapacitated child to be covered under his parent's health, dental or vision insurance. A parent may cover a child who is eligible for state benefits because he works for an employer that participates in PEBA insurance benefits. The child may be covered under his parent's health, dental and vision coverage. The child is not eligible for Basic Life, Optional Life, Dependent Life-Child or Long Term Disability insurance. A child who is eligible for benefits because he works for a participating employer must make a choice. He may be covered by his parents as a child or he may be covered on his own as an employee. He cannot be covered as a child on one insurance program, such as health, and then enroll for coverage as an employee on another, such as vision. For life insurance, if a child is eligible as an employee under the plan, he is not eligible as a dependent. Coverage under Dependent Life-Child Insurance According to state law, a dependent child, age 19-24, must be a full-time student to be covered under Dependent Life-Child insurance. A child of any age who has been certified by PEBA as an incapacitated child may continue to be covered under Dependent Life-Child. For more information about eligibility for Dependent Life-Child coverage, see Pages 105-106. To file a claim under Dependent Life-Child for a child age 19-24, a subscriber must obtain a statement on letterhead from the educational institution the child was attending that verifies he was a full-time student and gives his dates of enrollment. The statement should be given to the subscriber's benefits administrator, who will send it to Securian with the Notice of Death. To file a claim for an incapacitated child, the subscriber must give certification of incapacitation to his BA, who will send it to Securian with the claim form. Please note: If a child is found to be ineligible for Dependent Life-Child coverage, benefits will not be paid. An incapacitated childYou can continue to cover your child who is age 26 or older if he is incapacitated and you are financially responsible for him. To cover your dependent child who is incapacitated, he must meet these requirements: The child must have been continuously covered by health insurance from the time of incapacitationINSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201611 GENERAL INFORMATION The child must be unmarried and must remain unmarried to continue eligibility The child must be incapable of self-sustaining employment because of mental illness or intellectual or physical disability and must remain principally dependent (more than 50 percent) on the covered employee, retiree, survivor or COBRA subscriber for support and maintenance. Incapacitation must be established no later than 31 days after the child's 26th birthday, when he is no longer eligible for coverage as a child. For Dependent Life-Child coverage, it must be established no later than 31 days after his 19th birthday, if he is not a full-time student. An Incapacitated Child Certification Form must be completed by the subscriber and the child's physician and then sent to PEBA for review. PEBA will send the form to Standard Insurance Company for review of the medical information. Additional medical documentation from the child's physician may be required by The Standard. The Standard will forward its recommendation to PEBA, which makes the final decision. Please send a copy of your most recent federal tax return, which shows the child is principally dependent on you, the subscriber, for support and maintenance. Also attach a completed Authorized Representative Form signed by the incapacitated child, a copy of guardianship papers or a power of attorney that verifies your authority to act for your incapacitated child. Any of these documents give PEBA permission to discuss or disclose the child's protected health information with the child's Authorized Representative. A survivor Spouses and children covered under the State Health Plan, the State Dental Plan, or the State Vision Plan are classified as \"survivors\" when a covered employee or retiree dies. For more information about survivor coverage, see Pages 28-29. Initial enrollment If you are an employee or retiree of a participating group in South Carolina, you can enroll in insurance coverage within 31 days of the date you become eligible or the date you retire. You can also enroll your eligible spouse and/or children. A participating group is a state agency, higher education institution, public school district, county, municipality or other group that is authorized by statute to participate and is participating in the state insurance program. To enroll, you must complete a Notice of Election (NOE) form or your benefits administrator may enroll you online. Coverage is not automatic.

If you become eligible on a day other than the first calendar day or first working day of the month, your coverage starts on the first day of the next month. GENERAL INFORMATION12 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016 Coverage of your spouse and/or children, who have been enrolled in the plan, begins on the same day your coverage begins.

For more information about initial enrollment in Optional Life Insurance, see Page 107. Active employment means performing all the regular duties of an occupation on an employer's scheduled workday. You may be working at your usual workplace or elsewhere, if you are required to travel. You are also considered engaged in active employment while on jury duty, on a paid vacation day or on one of your employer's normal holidays if you were engaged in active employment on the previous regular workday. Coverage will not be delayed if you are absent from work due to a health-related reason when your coverage would otherwise start.

If you have specific questions, contact the vendor, which is listed on Pages 213-214. A list of coverage available to newly eligible employees is on Page 58-59, and information about coverage for retirees is on Page 173. After your initial enrollment Insurance cards If you enroll in the State Health Plan Standard Plan, Savings Plan or Medicare Supplemental Plan, BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina (BCBSSC) will send health insurance cards for you and your covered family members. You also will receive two pharmacy benefits cards from Express Scripts. Benefits administrators provide State Dental Plan subscribers with a card upon which they can write their name and Benefits ID Number. Dental Plus subscribers receive an insurance card from the dental plan contractor. State Vision Plan subscribers receive two paper cards from EyeMed Vision Care. Please check to make sure that you have coverage before you go to a doctor or fill a prescription. If you have not received your cards, you can get your Benefits Identification Number through MyBenefits. Benefits Identification Number (BIN)PEBA assigns each subscriber an eight-number Benefits Identification Number (BIN). This unique number is used instead of a Social Security number (SSN) in emails and written communication between you and your spouse and/or children and PEBA. It is designed to make your personal information more secure. The State Health Plan adds a three-letter prefix to your BIN and puts this number on your identification card. The BIN, with the three-letter prefix, is also used on Dental Plus cards. If you are not covered by a plan that uses the BIN, PEBA will send you your number. Keep your BIN in a safe place. Subscribers need their BIN, without the prefix, to use MyBenefits, PEBA's online insurance benefits enrollment system. If you forget your BIN, you can get it through MyBenefits. Just click on \"Get my BIN.\" In a medical emergency If, in an emergency, you need medical care before you receive your insurance cards, go to the PEBA website, www.eip.sc.gov, and select MyBenefits. Then select \"Get my BIN?\" Give your Benefits Identification Number to network providers. They will recognize it, and you will be able to use your coverage. If you have problems or questions, contact your benefits administrator. Dependent eligibility audits Your employer-sponsored health insurance is a valuable benefit, but it is also an expensive one. It becomes more costly to you and your employer when ineligible individuals are covered. PEBA Insurance Benefits requires documentation of eligibility when family members enroll in coverage. It also checks the eligibility of covered family members through the Dependent Eligibility Audit. This process is designed to ensure only eligible individuals are covered under state benefits. If you receive a letter asking you to provide specific documents showing that family members you cover are eligible, please respond as soon as possible. If you do not do INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201615 GENERAL INFORMATIONso within 60 days of the date of the letter from PEBA Insurance Benefits, family members whose eligibility has not been documented will be dropped from coverage. Enrolling as a transferring employee As an ongoing employee, PEBA considers you a transfer if you change employment from one participating group to another with no break in insurance coverage or with a break of employment of no more than 15 calendar days. To avoid a lapse in coverage or delays in processing claims, be sure to tell your benefits administrator if you transfer to another participating group. Check with the benefits administrator at your new employer to be sure that your benefits have been transferred. As an academic employee, you are considered a transfer if you complete a school term and move to another participating academic employer with less than a 26-week break in employment. Your insurance coverage with the employer you are leaving will remain in effect until you begin work with your new employer, typically September 1. On that date, your new employer will pick up your coverage. If you do not transfer to another participating academic employer, your coverage ends the last day of the month in which you were engaged in active employment. Ongoing academic employees would be considered continuing employees and would be eligible to change their coverage if their break in employment was more than 15 calendar days and less than 26 weeks. These ongoing academic employees would be treated as new employees if their break in employment was more than 26 weeks. They would be eligible to change their coverage. All other ongoing employees would be considered continuing employees eligible to change their coverage if their break in employment was more than 15 calendar days and less than 13 weeks. These ongoing employees would be treated as new employees if their break in coverage was more than 13 weeks. They would be eligible to change their coverage. If you are a new variable-hour, part-time or seasonal employee, check with your benefits administrator. Open enrollment is offered every October During the annual October open enrollment eligible employees, retirees, survivors and COBRA subscribers may change their coverage without regard to special eligibility situations.

Please note: Rather than using a paper Notice of Election form, a benefits administrator may make changes electronically and send them to the subscriber through MyBenefits. He must approve and electronically sign the Summary of Change. His benefits administrator also may print a paper Summary of Change for the subscriber to sign. The subscriber should give copies of any required documents to his benefits administrator, who will send them to PEBA. Marriage If you, as a covered subscriber, wish to add a spouse because you marry, you can do so by completing a Notice of Election form and submitting proof of the marriage (a copy of your marriage license or an executed Common Law Marriage Affidavit) within 31 days of the date of your marriage. The forms are on PEBA's website. You also may contact PEBA or your benefits administrator for a copy of the affidavit. If you are not covered, you may add health, Dental/Dental Plus and/or State Vision Plan coverage for yourself and your new spouse and/or new stepchildren within 31 days of the date of your marriage. If you add your new spouse or your new stepchildren to your health coverage, you may also change health plans. You may add your new spouse and/or new stepchildren to Dental/Dental Plus and State Vision Plan coverage. A copy of the marriage license is required to cover the new spouse. Long-form birth certificates are required for each stepchild you want to cover. Coverage becomes effective on the date of marriage, and you are responsible for any premiums owed. Marriage also allows a covered subscriber to enroll in or increase Optional Life coverage up to $50,000 without evidence of insurability. For information about eligibility for Dependent Life - Spouse coverage, including amounts in which a newly eligible spouse may enroll without evidence of insurability, see the Dependent Life Insurance section, which begins on Page 121 in the Life Insurance chapter. Coverage becomes effective the first of the month after the date requested if the employee is actively at work. Otherwise, it becomes effective the first of the month after his return to work. You cannot cover your spouse if he is eligible, or becomes eligible, for coverage as an employee or as a funded retiree of a participating group. If you do not add your new spouse and/or your new stepchildren within 31 days of the date of marriage, you cannot add them until the next open enrollment period, which occurs yearly in October, or within 31 days of a special eligibility situation. Legal separation If you and your covered spouse separate, your spouse may remain on your health, Dental/Dental Plus, State Vision Plan and Dependent Life-Spouse coverage until the divorce is final. If you do not participate in the MoneyPlus pretax premium feature, you can remove your spouse from your coverage when you separate. If you remove your spouse from health, dental or vision coverage, you must also remove him from the other two programs. For example, if you remove your spouse from dental, you must also remove him from health and vision. To do so, give your benefits administrator a copy of a court order signed by a Family Court judge. A letter from GENERAL INFORMATION18 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016an attorney is not sufficient documentation. The court order must be attached to a Notice of Election form and must be given to your benefits administrator within 31 days of the date the court document was stamped. Your spouse's coverage will end the last day of the month after the date of separation. If you do not request your spouse be removed from coverage within 31 days of the date stamp on the order, you must wait until the divorce is final or another special eligibility situation occurs. Also, if you do not participate in the MoneyPlus pretax premium feature and if your divorce is in process, you may enroll in or increase Optional Life coverage for up to $50,000 without evidence of insurability. To do so, you must submit a Notice of Election form to his benefits administrator within 31 days of the date of a court order signed by a Family Court judge. You can also decrease or cancel your Optional Life coverage. Changes are effective the first of the month after the date of the request if you are actively at work on that date. Otherwise, they are effective the first of the month after you return to work. If you reconcile with your spouse after you drop his health insurance, it cannot be reinstated until the next open enrollment period, which occurs yearly in October, or within 31 days of a special eligibility situation. Dental/Dental Plus coverage can be reinstated during the next open enrollment period in an odd-numbered year or within 31 days of a special eligibility situation. Vision coverage can be reinstated during the next open enrollment period or within 31 days of a special eligibility situation. You cannot drop your spouse from your MoneyPlus coverage because you are in the process of a divorce. When a divorce is final, it is a change-in-status event that permits you to change your MoneyPlus account. Divorce If you divorce, you must remove your former spouse and former stepchildren from your coverage by completing a Notice of Election form and submitting a complete copy of the divorce decree within 31 days of the date stamped on the divorce decree. Coverage for your former spouse and former stepchildren will end the last day of the month after the date the divorce decree is stamped. If you fail to drop your former spouse or former stepchildren within 31 days of the date the court order or divorce decree is stamped by the court, the change in coverage is effective the first of the month after your signature on the Notice of Election form dropping your former dependents. You may continue to provide health, vision and dental coverage for your former spouse and/or stepchildren only if the Family Court requires that you do so. You must provide a copy of the divorce decree ordering you to cover your former spouse and/or former stepchildren, as well as a Notice of Election form, to your benefits administrator, who will send both to PEBA. The document must list the plans under which your former spouse and/or former stepchildren must be covered. Retirees of state agencies, higher education institutions and school districts, survivors and COBRA subscribers should notify PEBA. Retirees of local subdivisions should notify their benefits administrator. The effective date is the first of the month after the divorce becomes final. You cannot continue to cover your former spouse or former stepchildren under INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201619 GENERAL INFORMATIONDependent Life insurance under any circumstances. When your divorce is final, you can enroll in or increase your Optional Life coverage by $50,000 without evidence of insurability. You may also cancel or decrease your Optional Life coverage. You also may be able to make changes in a Medical Spending Account or a Dependent Care Spending Account. If you remarry, you can cover your former spouse or your current spouse, but you cannot cover both under any PEBA insurance benefits plan. You can, however, cover one spouse under one plan (health, for example) and the other spouse under another plan (dental, for example). Former spouses and former stepchildren who lose coverage due to a qualifying event, such as divorce, may be eligible to continue coverage under COBRA. For more information, contact the subscriber's benefits administrator or PEBA within 60 days after the event or from when coverage would have been lost due to the event, whichever is later. Please note: An employee who covers an ex- spouse on any benefit is not eligible for the Pretax Group Insurance Premium Feature. This does not affect the employee's eligibility to participate in a Medical Spending Account or a Dependent Care Spending Account. Adding children Eligible children may be added by submitting a Notice of Election form and completing other requirements within 31 days of: Date of birth (effective on the date of birth) Marriage of the subscriber to the child's parent (effective on the date of the marriage) Gaining custody or guardianship with a court order (effective on the date the court stamped on the order) Adoption or placement for adoption (effective on the date of birth if adopted within 31 days of birth. Otherwise, effective on the date of adoption or placement for adoption.) Placement of a foster child (effective on the date of placement) Loss of other coverage (effective on the date of loss of coverage). The newly eligible child must be offered health, Dental/Dental Plus and State Vision Plan coverage. The subscriber and all other previously covered family members may change health plans. A child who is eligible, but not newly eligible, cannot be added at this time. However, a spouse may be added. If, within 31 days, an employee adds coverage of a newborn or a child who is adopted or placed with the employee for adoption, he can enroll in Optional Life or increase his coverage up to $50,000 without evidence of insurability. An employee also may enroll in Dependent Life-Child. Children must be listed on your Notice of Election form to be covered, even if you already have full family or employee/ children coverage. You must also submit a copy of the child's long-form birth certificate. Notification to Medi-Call of the delivery of your baby does not add the baby to your health insurance. To add a stepchild , submit a copy of his long- form birth certificate, showing the name of GENERAL INFORMATION20 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016the child's natural parent plus proof that the natural parent and the subscriber are married. To add a child under 18 who is adopted or placed for adoption, you must submit a Notice of Election form with one of the following: 1) a copy of the long-form birth certificate showing the subscriber as the parent; 2) a copy of the legal adoption documentation from the court verifying the completed adoption or 3) a letter of placement from an adoption agency, attorney or the S.C. Department of Social Services verifying the adoption is in progress. The effective date of health, dental and vision coverage is the child's date of birth, if the child is placed within 31 days of birth. Otherwise, it is the date of adoption or placement. For information about international adoptions, see your benefits administrator. To add a foster child to your policy , submit a copy of a court order or another legal document placing the child with you, the subscriber, and showing that you are a licensed foster parent. A foster child is not eligible for Dependent Life coverage. To add other children for whom you have legal custody, you must submit a copy of a court order or other legal document from the S.C. Department of Social Services or a placement agency granting you custody or guardianship. The documents must verify that you, the subscriber, have guardianship responsibility for the child and not just financial responsibility. If a court order is issued requiring you to cover your child, you must notify your employer and PEBA and elect coverage within 31 days of the date the court order was stamped by the court. Please note: if the court order was for health or dental coverage or for both, you must enroll yourself if you are not already covered. A copy of the entire court order or divorce decree stamped by the court must be attached to the Notice of Election form. It must list the names of the children to be covered and the type of coverage that must be provided. If you and your spouse are both eligible for coverage, only one of you can cover your children under any one plan. For example, one parent can cover the children under health, and the other can cover the children under dental. Only one parent can carry Dependent Life coverage for eligible dependent children. You also may be eligible to make changes in your Medical Spending Account or Dependent Care Spending Account. Dropping a spouse and/or children If a covered spouse or child becomes ineligible, you must drop him from your health, dental, vision and Dependent Life coverage. This may occur because of divorce or separation. To drop a spouse or child from your coverage, you must complete a Notice of Election form within 31 days of the date he becomes ineligible and provide documentation to your benefits administrator. When a child loses eligibility for health, dental or vision coverage because he turned 26, he will be dropped automatically the first of the month after he turns 26. If he is your last covered child, your level of coverage will be changed. Eligibility for Dependent Life-Child coverage ends at age 19 unless the child is a full-time student or an incapacitated child. If your child becomes eligible for group health, dental, vision or life insurance sponsored by an employer, either as an employee or as a INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201621 GENERAL INFORMATIONspouse, you have the option to drop him from your health, dental, or vision coverage. You are required to drop him from Dependent Life-Child coverage. Within 31 days of eligibility, you should provide your benefits administrator with a letter from the employer showing the date the child became eligible for coverage. Your child will be dropped from coverage the first of the month after the notice. Gaining other coverage If your spouse gains eligibility for coverage as an employee of a group that also offers insurance benefits through PEBA, you must drop him within 31 days by completing a Notice of Election form. No other documentation is needed. If you or your spouse gain coverage through a group that does not offer insurance benefits through PEBA and you wish to drop your PEBA insurance coverage, you have 31 days to cancel the type of coverage gained. You must complete a Notice of Election form and return it to your benefits office with proof of the other coverage. To document gain of coverage, you must present a letter on company letterhead that includes the effective date of coverage, names of all individuals covered and the types of coverage gained. Only those who gained coverage may be dropped. If you fail to cancel coverage within 31 days, you must wait until the next open enrollment period. For more information, contact your benefits administrator or PEBA. Gain of Medicare coverage If you, your spouse or your child gains Medicare coverage, the family member who gained coverage may drop health coverage through PEBA within 31 days of the date Part A is effective. Attach a copy of the Medicare card to a Notice of Election form and give it to your benefits administrator within 31 days of the date on the confirmation letter from the Social Security Administration. Coverage will be canceled on the effective date of the Medicare Part A coverage or, in some circumstances, the first of the month after gain of Medicare. A gain of Medicare coverage does not permit a subscriber to change dental and/or vision coverage. For more information, see the When You Become Eligible for Medicare handbook, which is available at www.eip.sc.gov, or from PEBA. Loss of other coverage If you refuse enrollment for yourself or your eligible family members because of other coverage, you may later be able to enroll yourself and/or your eligible family members in coverage if you and your spouse and/or children lose eligibility for that other coverage (or if the employer stops contributing to the coverage). If you are the employee or retiree, you lose other group health coverage and you are not already covered by health insurance through PEBA, you may enroll yourself and your eligible spouse and/or children in health, Dental/Dental Plus, and/or State Vision Plan coverage. If you are already covered by health, you cannot make changes. If your hours were reduced and you lost coverage and you are otherwise eligible as a spouse or a child, you may enroll in health, dental and vision coverage. If you are the employee or retiree and have a spouse or child who loses other group health coverage, you may enroll GENERAL INFORMATION22 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016the eligible spouse and/or children in health, Dental/Dental Plus, and/or State Vision Plan coverage. If you are not already covered, you may enroll yourself with the individual who lost coverage. You may enroll only the spouse and/or children who lost health insurance coverage. If you are already covered as an employee or retiree, you may change health plans (for example, Savings Plan to Standard Plan) when you add the spouse and/or children who lost health insurance coverage. Contributions toward your deductible will start over. If you, your spouse and/or children lose dental or vision coverage or both but do not lose health coverage, then you, your spouse and/or children who lost the dental or vision coverage or both may enroll in the type of coverage that was lost. If you are not already covered, you must enroll yourself with the individual who lost coverage. An employee who lost other life insurance coverage can enroll in Optional Life coverage for $10,000 or $20,000 with evidence of insurability. If you refused coverage because you were covered under your parent's plan and you lose that coverage, you may enroll yourself and/or your eligible family members in health, dental and vision coverage. For information about Optional Life, Dependent Life-Spouse, Dependent Life-Child or Supplemental Long Term Disability insurance, contact your benefits administrator. Loss of TRICARE coverage is a special eligibility situation that permits an eligible employee or retiree and his dependents, if the dependents are otherwise eligible for coverage through PEBA, to enroll in health, dental and vision coverage. You must complete a Notice of Election form within 31 days of the date the other coverage ends. To enroll because of a loss of coverage, you must give your benefits office a letter on company letterhead listing the names of those covered and the date coverage was lost, a completed Notice of Election form and copies of appropriate documents showing how any added family member is related to you. If a subscriber, spouse or child loses health coverage, he also may enroll in vision or dental coverage, even if he did not lose that coverage. Coverage under Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Gain of Medicaid or CHIP coverage If you or your covered family members become eligible for Medicaid or CHIP coverage, you have 60 days to drop coverage through PEBA. An employee may cancel health, dental and/or vision coverage if he gains Medicaid coverage. If a spouse or a child gains Medicaid, only the family member who gained coverage may be dropped. A copy of the Medicaid approval letter must be attached to the NOE. Eligibility for premium assistance through Medicaid or CHIP If you or your spouse and/or children become eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or through CHIP, you may be able to enroll yourself and your spouse and/or children in PEBA-sponsored health insurance. However, you must request enrollment within 60 days of the date you are determined to be eligible for premium assistance.INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201623 GENERAL INFORMATIONLoss of Medicaid or CHIP coverage If you refused coverage in PEBA-sponsored health, dental and vision insurance for yourself or for your eligible spouse and/or children because of coverage under Medicaid or CHIP and then lost eligibility for that coverage, you may be able to enroll in a PEBA plan. However, you must request enrollment within 60 days of the date the other coverage ends. Leaves of absence PEBA does not dictate your employment status, only the coverage that is available to you through PEBA's insurance programs. Premiums while on unpaid leaveIf you are enrolled in benefits and remain eligible for coverage, your coverage will continue. You should contact your benefits administrator to discuss payment arrangements. If you are on unpaid leave and you can no longer afford premiums for the health plan in which you are enrolled through PEBA, you may drop all of your coverage with PEBA only if you intend to enroll in another health plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Because you are voluntarily dropping coverage, neither you nor any of your dependents will be eligible for continued coverage under COBRA. If you drop coverage, you will only be permitted to re-enroll during open enrollment or within 31 days of gaining eligibility under a provision of the plan, such as a special eligibility situation. If your coverage is canceled due to failure to pay premiums, you will not be eligible for COBRA continuation coverage, and you will not be eligible to re-enroll in benefits with your employer until the next open enrollment period, if you are eligible, or within 31 days of gaining eligibility under a provision of the plan. For more information on continuation of coverage under COBRA, see Pages 31-33. Life insurance while on unpaid leave You may continue your Optional Life, Dependent Life-Spouse and Dependent Life-Child insurance for up to 12 months from your last day worked. If you elect not to continue your life insurance while you are on unpaid leave you may convert your coverage to an individual whole life policy by completing the appropriate form within 31 days of your last day worked. Supplemental Long Term Disability Insurance while on paid or unpaid leave Your Supplemental Long Term Disability (SLTD) insurance will end 30 days from your last day worked. There is no option to continue SLTD. For more information, contact your benefits administrator. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave Under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) employers are required to provide job-protected leave, continuation of certain benefits and restoration of certain benefits upon return from leave for certain specified family and medical reasons. If you are going on FMLA leave or returning from FMLA leave, contact your benefits administrator for information. Military leave Under the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act (USERRA) GENERAL INFORMATION24 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016employers are required to provide certain re- employment and benefits rights to employees who serve or have served in the uniformed services. If you are going on military leave or returning from military leave, please contact your benefits administrator for information. Workers' Compensation If you are on approved leave and receiving workers' compensation benefits under state law, you may continue your coverage as long as you pay the required premium. Insurance offered through PEBA is not meant to replace workers' compensation and does not affect any requirement for coverage for workers' compensation insurance. It is not intended to provide or duplicate benefits for work-related injuries that are within the Workers' Compensation Act. If you need more information, contact your benefits office. Health and wellness PEBA's Health and Wellness Programs are designed to help subscribers and their families lead healthier lives. They promote good health through disease prevention, early detection of disease and chronic disease education. In 2016, as part of PEBA Perks, these value- based preventive services are offered at no cost to Savings Plan and Standard Plan members: Colonoscopies, both routine and diagnostic, for members within the age ranges recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This includes the consultation, the prep kit, the procedure and associated anesthesia. Adult vaccinations at the intervals recommended by the Centers for Disease Control. Prescription drugs for smoking cessation, including Chantix and bupropion (generic Zyban). Diabetes education services offered by network providers. For more information, see the State Health Plan section of the Health Insurance chapter, which begins on Page 31 or visit www.eip.sc.gov/wellness. A major wellness benefit is the preventive screening. This comprehensive, biometric screening includes fasting blood work, a personal health risk appraisal, height and weight measurements, blood pressure and lipid panels. The confidential report highlights measurements outside the normal range, which may show the individual is at risk for developing diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and anemia. Participants are encouraged to give the screening results to their doctor. This screening is available yearly to employees, retirees, subscribers with continued coverage under COBRA and their covered spouses whose primary insurance coverage is the Standard Plan or the Savings Plan. Subscribers whose primary coverage is Medicare are not eligible. Individuals are screened at their current or former workplace. To find out when a screening is scheduled, employees should contact their benefits administrator. Retirees should contact the staff at their former workplace. Regional screenings are offered, as are screenings at some participating providers. Flu vaccinations are among the shots offered at no charge to all members covered under the Savings Plan or the Standard Plan. If a member receives the shot in a network doctor's office, the flu vaccine and the administration fee will be paid in full. INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201625 GENERAL INFORMATIONAny associated office visit charges will be processed according to regular plan coverage rules. The Health and wellness section of PEBA's website also provides information about ways to improve your health. For more information about Health and Wellness Programs, contact your benefits office, or go to www.eip.sc.gov. When coverage ends Your coverage will end: The last day of the month in which you were engaged in active employment, unless you are transferring to another participating group The last day of the month in which you become ineligible for coverage (for example, your working hours are reduced from full-time to part-time) The day after your death The date the coverage ends for all subscribers or The last day of the month in which your premiums were paid in full. (You must pay the entire premium, including the tobacco-use surcharge, if it applies.) Coverage for your spouse and/or children will end: The date your coverage ends The date coverage for spouses and children is no longer offered or The last day of the month in which your spouse or child's eligibility for coverage ends. If your coverage or your spouse or child's coverage ends, you may be eligible for continuation of coverage as a retiree, as a survivor or under COBRA. To drop a spouse or child from coverage, complete a Notice of Election form within 31 days of the date the spouse or child is no longer eligible for coverage. COBRA Eligibility COBRA is short for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. It requires that continuation of group health, vision, dental and/or Medical Spending Account coverage* be offered to you and/or your covered spouse and/or children if you are no longer eligible for coverage due to a qualifying event. Qualifying events include: The covered employee's working hours are reduced from full-time to part-time The covered employee voluntarily quits work, retires, is laid off or is fired (unless the firing is due to gross misconduct) A covered spouse loses eligibility due to a legal separation or divorce A child no longer qualifies for coverage. If you are a variable-hour or seasonal employee, you are not eligible for a Medical Spending Account and may not enroll in one under COBRA. The other rules discussed in this section apply to you and/or to your covered dependents. For more information, contact your employer. *Please note: Individuals eligible for continued coverage under COBRA may continue to participate in a Health Savings Account, as long as they remain covered by the Savings Plan and meet other eligibility requirements. When continued coverage will not be offered Continued coverage under COBRA will not be offered to an individual who loses coverage: As a result of a Dependent Eligibility GENERAL INFORMATION26 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016Audit For failure to pay premiums When coverage was canceled at the subscriber's request. How to continue coverage under COBRA For a covered spouse or children or both to continue coverage under COBRA, the subscriber or covered family member must notify his benefits office within 60 days after the qualifying event or the date coverage would have been lost due to the qualifying event, whichever is later. Otherwise, the individual will lose his rights to continue his coverage. To continue coverage under COBRA, a COBRA Notice of Election form and premiums must be submitted. The premiums must be paid within 45 days of the date coverage was elected. The first premium payment must include premiums back to the date of the loss of coverage. For example: You lost coverage on June 30, elected coverage on August 15 and paid the initial premium on September 17. You would be required to pay three premiums: one for the month following the date you lost coverage (July); one for the month in which you elected coverage (August); and one for the month in which you made your first payment (September). Continued coverage starts when the first premium is paid. It is effective the day after your previous coverage ended. Coverage remains in effect only as long as the premiums are up to date. A premium is considered paid on the date of the postmark or the date it is hand-delivered, not the date on the check.PEBA is the benefits administrator for COBRA subscribers of state agencies, higher education institutions and public school districts. COBRA subscribers from local subdivisions keep the same benefits administrator. How continued coverage under COBRA may end Continued coverage will end before the maximum benefit period is over if: 1. A subscriber fails to pay the full premium on time 2. A qualified beneficiary gains coverage under another group health plan 3. A qualified beneficiary becomes entitled to Medicare 4. PEBA no longer provides group health coverage 5. During a disability extension, the Social Security Administration determines the qualified beneficiary is no longer disabled 6. An event occurs that would cause PEBA to end the coverage of any subscriber, such as the subscriber commits fraud. The qualified beneficiary, his personal representative or his guardian is responsible for notifying PEBA when he is no longer eligible for continued coverage. Continued coverage will be canceled automatically by PEBA in situations numbered 1, 3 and 6. The qualified beneficiary is responsible for submitting a Notice to Terminate COBRA Continuation Coverage, along with supporting documents, in situations numbered 2 and 5. If you decide to terminate your COBRA coverage early, you generally won't be able to get a Marketplace plan outside of the open enrollment period. Furthermore, if following the expiration of the election period you INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201627 GENERAL INFORMATIONdecide to terminate your COBRA coverage early, you cannot again change your mind and get COBRA coverage at a later date. A qualified beneficiary cancels COBRA coverage by submitting a completed COBRA Notice to Terminate form. How Medicare affects continued coverage under COBRA If you or your eligible spouse or child continued coverage and becomes eligible for Medicare Part A, Part B or both, please notify PEBA. A subscriber or eligible spouse or child who is covered by Medicare and then becomes eligible for continued coverage can enroll in continued coverage under COBRA for secondary coverage. Medicare will be his primary coverage. If a subscriber or a spouse or child gains Medicare coverage while enrolled in continued coverage under COBRA, he must drop his health insurance. However, he may keep his dental and vision insurance. For more information about COBRA, contact your benefits office or PEBA. When benefits provided under COBRA run out The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) guarantees that persons who have exhausted continued coverage under COBRA and are not eligible for coverage under another group health plan have access to health insurance without being subject to a pre-existing condition exclusion period. However, certain conditions must be met. In South Carolina, the South Carolina Health Insurance Pool provides this guarantee of health insurance coverage. For information, call 803.788.0500, ext. 46401 or 800.868.2500, ext. 46401. Extending continued coverage If you enroll in continued coverage under COBRA, an extension of the maximum period of coverage may be available if you, as a qualified beneficiary, are disabled or a second qualifying event occurs. You must notify your COBRA administrator, within certain time frames, of a disability or a second qualifying event to extend the period of continued coverage. Failure to provide timely notice of a disability or a second qualifying event may affect the right to extend the period of continued coverage under COBRA. For detailed information see the COBRA notice beginning on Page 201. Other coverage options Under the federal Affordable Care Act, you can buy coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. In the Marketplace, you could be eligible for a tax credit that lowers your monthly premium. Information about premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs is available before enrollment. Eligibility for COBRA does not limit your eligibility for a tax credit through the Marketplace. If your working hours are reduced and you can no longer afford premiums for the health plan in which you are enrolled through PEBA, you may drop that coverage only if you intend to enroll in another health plan through the Marketplace. Contact your benefits administrator to complete the appropriate form. You also may qualify for special enrollment in another group health plan for which you are GENERAL INFORMATION28 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016eligible, such as a spouse's plan, even if the plan generally does not accept late enrollees. However, you must request enrollment within 31 days. Remember, if you voluntarily drop coverage through PEBA because of a reduction in hours but later your hours are increased, you will only be permitted to re-enroll during open enrollment or within 31 days of gaining eligibility under a provision of the plan, such as a special eligibility situation. Death of a subscriber or covered spouse or child If an active employee or a retiree of a local subdivision dies, a family member should contact the deceased's employer to report the death, to discontinue the employee's coverage and start survivor coverage for his covered spouse and/or children. If a retiree of a state agency, higher education institution or public school district dies, a family member should contact PEBA. To continue coverage, a Survivor Notice of Election form must be completed within 31 days of the subscriber's date of death. A new Benefits ID Number will be created, and identification cards will be issued by the vendors of the programs under which the survivors are covered. If your covered spouse or child dies, please contact your benefits administrator. PEBA is the benefits administrator for retirees of state agencies, higher education institutions and public school districts. Retiree subscribers of local subdivisions keep the same benefits administrator. Survivors Spouses and children who are covered under the State Health Plan are eligible as survivors for a one-year waiver of health insurance premiums, including the tobacco-use surcharge, if it applies, when a covered employee dies. Premiums are also waived for qualified survivors of funded retirees of state agencies, higher education institutions and public school districts. Participating local subdivisions may elect to, but are not required to, waive the premiums of survivors of retirees. A survivor of a retiree of a participating local subdivision should check with the retiree's benefits administrator to see whether the waiver applies. After the premium has been waived for a year, a survivor must pay the subscriber and employer share of the premium to continue coverage. If the deceased and his spouse are either covered employees or retirees at the time of death, the surviving spouse is not eligible for the premium waiver. Dental and vision premiums are not waived. However, survivors, including survivors of a subscriber covered under the TRICARE Supplement Plan, may continue dental and vision coverage by paying the full premium. The health and dental premiums of a covered spouse or child of a covered employee who was killed in the line of duty while working for a participating group will be waived for the first year after the employee's death. Dental premiums also will be waived for a covered spouse or child of an employee who was covered by the TRICARE Supplement Plan and who was killed in the line of duty while working for a participating group. The survivor must submit verification of death in the line of duty. INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201629 GENERAL INFORMATIONAfter the one-year waiver, a covered surviving spouse of a covered employee of a state agency, higher education institution or a public school district employee who was killed in the line of duty may continue coverage, at the employer-funded rate, until he remarries or otherwise becomes ineligible. A covered surviving child may continue coverage at the employer-funded rate until he is no longer eligible. Participating local subdivisions may elect to, but are not required to, contribute to a survivor's insurance premium, but the survivor may continue coverage, at the full rate, for as long as he is eligible. A surviving spouse may continue coverage until he remarries. A child can continue coverage until he is no longer eligible. Please notify PEBA within 31 days of loss of eligibility for coverage. A person who is no longer eligible for coverage as a survivor may be eligible to continue coverage under COBRA. Contact PEBA for details. As long as a survivor remains covered by health, vision or dental insurance, he can add health and vision during the annual October open enrollment, or within 31 days of a special eligibility situation. Dental coverage can be added or dropped but only during open enrollment in an odd-numbered year or within 31 days of a special eligibility situation. If a survivor drops health, vision and dental insurance, he is no longer eligible as a survivor and cannot re-enroll in coverage, even during open enrollment. If a surviving spouse becomes an active employee of a participating employer, he can switch to active coverage. When he leaves active employment, he can go back to survivor coverage within 31 days, if he has not remarried.Appeals What if I disagree with a decision about eligibility? This chapter includes a summary of the eligibility rules for benefits offered through PEBA. Eligibility determinations are subject to the provisions of the Plan of Benefits and to state law. If you are dissatisfied after an eligibility determination has been made, you may ask PEBA to review the decision: If you are an employee, a Request for Review should be submitted through your benefits office. Your benefits administrator may write a letter or use the Request for Review form, which is on PEBA's website, www.eip.sc.gov. If you are a retiree, survivor or COBRA subscriber of a state agency, a public school district or a higher education institution, submit your request directly to PEBA, which is your benefits administrator. If you are a retiree, survivor or COBRA subscriber of a local subdivision, submit your request through the benefits office of your former employer, which is your benefits administrator. If the request for review is denied, you may appeal by writing to the PEBA Appeals Committee within 90 days of notice of the decision. Please include a copy of the denial with your appeal. If the PEBA Appeals Committee denies your appeal, you have 30 days to seek judicial review as provided by Sections 1-11-710 and 1-23-380 of the S.C. Code of Laws, as amended.30 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016 Health insuranceINSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201631 HEALTH INSURANCEWhat are my health plan choices? Your health plan choices are the Standard Plan, the Savings Plan and, if you are retired and enrolled in Medicare, the Medicare Supplemental Plan. Eligible members of the military community may enroll in the GEA TRICARE Supplement Plan. Eligibility, enrollment and other features that are common to the insurance programs offered through the South Carolina Public Employee Benefit Authority (PEBA), are available in this chapter of the guide. Please note: The health insurance plans available through PEBA do not have a lifetime maximum benefit limitation with the exception of a lifetime maximum benefit payment of $15,000 for infertility treatment as describe on Pages 57-58. Notice to subscribers: tobacco-use surcharge If you are a State Health Plan subscriber with single coverage and you use tobacco, you will pay a $40 monthly surcharge. If you have subscriber/spouse, subscriber/children or full-family coverage and you or anyone you cover uses tobacco, the surcharge will be $60 monthly. The surcharge is automatic for State Health Plan subscribers unless the subscriber certifies no one he covers uses tobacco or covered individuals who use tobacco have completed the Quit for Life \u00ae smoking cessation program. For information about Quit for Life, see Page 74. To certify no one covered by his health insurance uses tobacco and no one has used it during the past six months, or all covered individuals who use tobacco have completed the Quit for Life \u00ae smoking cessation program, the subscriber must complete a Certification Regarding Tobacco Use form. If you have not certified or need to change your certification, go to PEBA's insurance benefits website, www.eip.sc.gov, and click on \"Tobacco Information.\" Give your completed certification form to your benefits administrator, who will send it to PEBA. The certification will be effective the first of the month after PEBA receives the form. A subscriber must pay all of his premiums, including the tobacco-use surcharge, if it applies, when they are due. If he does not, coverage for all of his plans will be canceled effective the last day of the month in which the premiums were paid in full. The State Health Plan The State Health Plan (SHP) offers the Standard Plan, the Savings Plan and, for retirees enrolled in Medicare, the Medicare Supplemental Plan. It is important that you understand how your plan works. The Standard Plan has higher premiums but lower annual deductibles than the Savings Plan. When one family member meets his deductible, the Standard Plan will begin to pay benefits for him, even if the family deductible has not been met. With the Standard Plan, when you buy a prescription drug, you make a copayment rather than paying the allowed amount. (The allowed amount is the most a health plan allows for a covered service or product, whether it is provided in network or out of network.) Network providers have agreed to accept the allowed amount as their total fee. You do not have to meet your deductible to buy prescription drugs for the HEALTH INSURANCE32 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016copayment. As a Savings Plan subscriber, you take greater responsibility for your health care costs and accept a higher annual deductible. You pay the full allowed amount for covered medical benefits (including mental health/substance abuse benefits and prescription drugs) until you reach the deductible. As a result, you save money on premiums. Another advantage is that because the Savings Plan is a tax-qualified, high-deductible health plan, you may establish a Health Savings Account (HSA) if you have no other health coverage, including Medicare, unless it is another high-deductible health plan, and you cannot be claimed as a dependent on another person's tax return. Funds in an HSA may be used to pay qualified medical expenses now and in the future. For information about how the Standard Plan and the Medicare Supplemental Plan work with Medicare, see the When You Become Eligible for Medicare handbook, which is available online and from PEBA. The Plan of Benefits, which contains a complete description of the plan, governs the Standard, Savings and Medicare Supplemental plans offered by the state. It is available on PEBA's insurance benefits website, www.eip.sc.gov, or from your benefits administrator.

How the SHP pays for covered benefits PEBA contracts with several companies to process your claims in a cost-effective, timely manner: BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina (BCBSSC) is the medical claims processor. Medi-Call, a division of BCBSSC, provides medical preauthorization and case management services. For more information about Medi-Call, see Pages 46-48. Companion Benefit Alternatives (CBA), a wholly owned subsidiary of BCBSSC, is the behavioral health manager, handling mental health and substance abuse treatment preauthorization, case management and provider networks.

Allowed amount The allowed amount is the most a plan allows for a covered service. Network providers have agreed to accept the allowed amount as their total fee, leaving you responsible only for copayments and 20 percent coinsurance after your annual deductible is met. (Savings Plan subscribers do not pay copayments.) For out-of-network services, you will pay more in coinsurance and the provider may charge more than the allowed amount. See Balance Billing on Page 45. How the Standard Plan works Annual deductible The annual deductible is the amount you must pay each year for covered medical benefits (including mental health and substance abuse benefits) before the plan begins to pay a percentage of the cost of your covered medical benefits. The annual deductibles are: $445 for individual coverage $890 for family coverage With the Standard Plan, the family deductible is the same regardless of how many family members are covered. The family deductible may be met by any combination of two or more family members' covered medical expenses as long as they total $890. For example, if four people each have $222.50 in covered expenses, the family deductible has been met, even if no one person has met the $445 individual deductible. If only one person has met the $445 individual deductible, the plan will begin paying a percentage of the cost of his benefits but not a percentage of the cost of the rest of the family's benefits until the family deductible has been met. No family member may pay more than $445 toward the family deductible. If the subscriber and his spouse, who is also covered as an employee or retiree, select the same health plan, they share the family deductible. Both spouses must be listed on the same Notice of Election form. Payments for non-covered services, copayments and penalties for not calling Medi-Call, National Imaging Associates or Companion Benefit Alternatives do not count toward the annual deductible. Copayments Standard Plan subscribers pay these Annual deductible has not been met Allowed amount $56 Copayment - $12 Remaining allowed amount, which goes toward the annual deductible$44 Copayment $12 Applied to deductible + $44 Your total payment $56 Annual deductible has been met Allowed amount $56 Copayment - $12 Remaining allowed amount *In this example, the Standard Plan paid 80 percent of the $44 allowed amount remaining after the copayment, totaling $35.20.HEALTH INSURANCE36 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016copayments: Copayments for prescription drugs. Copayments for services in a professional provider's office; for outpatient facility services, which may be provided in an outpatient department of a hospital or in a freestanding facility; and for care in an emergency room. The $12 Standard Plan copayment for services received in a professional provider's office is not charged for services at a BCBSSC-affiliated Patient-Centered Medical Home. See Page 40. A prescription drug copayment is a fixed total amount a Standard Plan subscriber pays for each prescription. The copayment maximum for each family member covered is $2,500. The difference between the cost of a brand name drug and generic drug does not count toward the annual prescription drug copayment. Drug costs do not apply to the annual deductible or the coinsurance maximum. For more information, see Pages 67-72. A copayment for services in a provider's office, for outpatient facility services or for care in an emergency room is the amount a Standard Plan subscriber pays before the cost of care begins to apply to his deductible or to his coinsurance maximum. You continue to pay these copayments even after you meet your annual deductible and reach your coinsurance maximum. These copayments do not apply to your annual deductible or your coinsurance maximum. The copayment for each visit to a professional provider's office is $12. This copayment is waived for routine Pap tests, routine mammograms and well child care visits. The following example uses a physician's office visit that has a $56 allowed amount in the Standard Plan. The copayment for outpatient facility services, which includes outpatient hospital services other than emergency room visits and ambulatory surgical center services, is $95. This copayment is waived for dialysis, routine mammograms, routine Pap tests, physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, clinic visits, oncology services, electro-convulsive therapy, psychiatric medication management and partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient behavioral health services. The copayment for each emergency room visit is $159. This copayment is waived if you are admitted to the hospital. Coinsurance After you meet your annual deductible, the Standard Plan pays 80 percent of the allowed amount for your covered medical and mental health/substance abuse benefits if you use network providers. You pay 20 percent as coinsurance, which applies to your coinsurance maximum. If you use out-of-network providers, the plan pays 60 percent of the plan's allowed amount for your covered medical and mental health/substance abuse benefits, and you pay 40 percent as coinsurance, which applies to your out-of-network coinsurance maximum. Any charge above the plan's allowed amount for a covered medical or mental health/substance abuse benefit is your responsibility. See Pages 45-46 to learn more about balance billing and the out-of-network differential. Standard Plan members pay 10 percent coinsurance, rather than 20 percent coinsurance, for services received at a BCBSSC-affiliated Patient-Centered Medical Home.INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201637 HEALTH INSURANCEA different coinsurance rate applies for infertility treatments and prescription drugs associated with infertility. See Pages 57-58. Coinsurance maximum The coinsurance maximum is the amount in coinsurance a subscriber must pay for covered benefits each year before he is no longer required to pay coinsurance. Under the Standard Plan, it is $2,540 for individual coverage and $5,080 for family coverage for network services and $5,080 for individual coverage and $10,160 for family coverage for out-of-network services. Please note: The coinsurance for network services does not apply to the out-of-network coinsurance maximum. The coinsurance for out-of-network services does not apply to the network coinsurance maximum. For example: If you have individual coverage, the network coinsurance maximum is $2,540 and you have paid $2,000 in network coinsurance and $600 in out-of-network coinsurance, you have not met your in-network coinsurance maximum. Standard Plan subscribers continue to pay copayments even after they meet their annual deductible and coinsurance maximum. Copayments for services in a provider's office, for outpatient facility services and in an emergency room do not apply to the annual deductible or to the coinsurance maximum. Prescription drug copayments apply to the $2,500 prescription drug copayment maximum but do not apply to the annual deductible or the coinsurance maximum. Payments for non-covered services, deductibles and penalties for not calling Medi-Call, National Imaging Associates or Companion Benefit Alternatives (CBA) do not count toward the coinsurance maximum.How the Savings Plan works Annual deductible The annual deductible is the amount you must pay each year for covered medical and mental health/substance abuse benefits and prescription drugs before the Savings Plan begins to pay a percentage of the cost of your covered benefits. The annual deductibles are: $3,600 for individual coverage $7,200 for family coverage. There is no individual deductible if more than one family member is covered. If the subscriber and spouse, who is also covered as an employee or retiree, select the same health plan, they will share the family deductible. The deductible is not met for any covered individual until the total allowed amount paid for covered benefits exceeds $7,200. For example, even if one family member has paid $3,601 for covered medical benefits, the plan will not begin paying a percentage of the cost of his covered benefits until his family has paid $7,200 for covered benefits. However, if the subscriber has paid $2,199 for covered benefits, the spouse has paid $3,001 for covered benefits and a child has paid $2,000 for covered benefits, the plan will begin paying a percentage of the cost of the covered benefits for all family members. If you are covered under the Savings Plan, you pay the full allowed amount for covered prescription drugs, and the amount is applied to your deductible. There are no copayments under the Savings Plan. You pay the full allowed amount for services, which is applied to your annual HEALTH INSURANCE38 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016deductible. Coinsurance After you meet your annual deductible, the Savings Plan pays 80 percent of the allowed amount for your covered medical, prescription drug and mental health/substance abuse benefits if you use network providers. You pay 20 percent as coinsurance. After you meet your coinsurance maximum, you are reimbursed for 100 percent of the allowed amount. Savings Plan members pay 10 percent coinsurance, rather than 20 percent coinsurance, for services received at a BCBSSC-affiliated Patient-Centered Medical Home. If you use out-of-network providers, the plan pays 60 percent of the plan's allowed amount for your covered medical and mental health/substance abuse benefits, and you pay 40 percent as coinsurance. Any charge above the plan's allowed amount for a covered medical or mental health/substance abuse benefit is your responsibility. See Pages 45-46 to learn more about balance billing and the out-of-network differential. Prescription drug benefits are paid only if you use a network provider. A different coinsurance rate applies for infertility treatments and prescription drugs associated with infertility. See Pages 57-58. Coinsurance maximum The coinsurance maximum is the amount in coinsurance a subscriber must pay for covered benefits each year before he is no longer required to pay coinsurance. Under the Savings Plan it is $2,400 for individual coverage or $4,800 for family coverage for network services and $4,800 for individual coverage or $9,600 for family coverage for out-of-network services. Please note: The coinsurance for network services does not apply to the out-of-network coinsurance maximum. The coinsurance for out-of-network services does not apply to the network coinsurance maximum. For example: If you have individual coverage and have paid $2,000 in network coinsurance and $400 in out-of-network coinsurance, you have not met your network coinsurance maximum. Payments for non-covered services, deductibles and penalties for not calling Medi-Call, National Imaging Associates or Companion Benefit Alternatives (CBA) do not count toward the coinsurance maximum. Coordination of benefits Some families, in which one spouse works for a participating employer and the other works for an employer that is not covered through PEBA Insurance Benefits, may be eligible to covered by two health plans. While the additional coverage may mean that more of their medical expenses are paid by insurance, they will probably pay premiums for both plans. Weigh the advantages and disadvantages before purchasing extra coverage. All State Health Plan benefits are subject to coordination of benefits (COB). COB is used to make sure a person covered by more than one insurance plan is not reimbursed more than once for the same expenses. With COB, the plan that pays first is the primary plan. The secondary plan pays after the primary plan. Here are some examples of how this works: The plan that covers a person as an INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201639 HEALTH INSURANCEemployee typically pays before the plan that covers the person as a dependent. When both parents cover a child, the plan of the parent whose birthday comes earlier in the year pays first. Keep in mind that other rules may apply in special situations, such as when a child's parents are divorced. If you are eligible for Medicare and are covered as an active employee, your State Health Plan coverage pays before Medicare. Exceptions may apply in the case of Medicare coverage due to kidney disease. Contact your local Social Security Administration office for details. If a person is covered by one plan because the subscriber is an active employee and by another plan because the subscriber is retired, the plan that covers him as active employee typically pays first. There may be exceptions to this rule. The State Health Plan is not responsible for filing or processing claims for a subscriber through another health insurance plan. That is the subscriber's responsibility. As part of coordination of benefits with the Standard Plan and the Savings Plan: On your Notice of Election form, you are asked if you are covered by more than one group insurance plan. Your response is recorded and placed in your file; however, BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina (BCBSSC) may send you a coordination of benefits questionnaire every year. Complete this form and return it to BCBSSC promptly since claims will not be processed or paid until BCBSSC receives your information. You can also update this information by calling BCBSSC or by visiting www.StateSC.SouthCarolinaBlues.com. Go to \"Member and Documents\" and then \"Other Health/Dental Insurance.\" This is how the State Health Plan works as secondary insurance: For a medical or a mental health/substance abuse claim, you or your provider must file the Explanation of Benefits from your primary plan with BCBSSC. For prescription drug benefits, you must present your card for your primary coverage first. Otherwise, the claim will be rejected because the pharmacist's electronic system will show that the SHP is secondary coverage. After the pharmacy processes the claim with your primary coverage, you must file a paper claim through Express Scripts for payment of any secondary benefits. Prescription drug claim forms are on Express Scripts', website, www.Express-Scripts.com. You may also ask your benefits administrator for the form. The State Health Plan will pay the lesser of: 1) what it would pay if it were the primary payer; or 2) the balance after the primary plan's network discounts and/or payments are deducted from the total charge. The State Health Plan's limit on balance billing does not apply; therefore, it is important that you use a provider in your primary plan's network. You also will be responsible for the State Health Plan copayments and deductible and the State Health Plan coinsurance if the coinsurance maximum has not been met. Please note: If your coverage with any other HEALTH INSURANCE40 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016health insurance program is canceled, request a letter of termination. The letter of termination must be submitted to BCBSSC promptly because claims will not be processed or paid until BCBSSC receives your information. Learn more about the claims process in the Appendix of this guide. Patient-Centered Medical Home A Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) is a primary care physician practice. As part of a PCMH, a patient has a health care team that is typically led by a doctor. It may include nurses, a nutritionist, health educators, pharmacists and behavioral health specialists. The team makes referrals to other providers as needed. Communication among the team members and with the patient is an important part of the medical practice. The focus in a PCMH is on coordinating care and preventing illnesses rather than waiting until an illness occurs and then treating it. The team helps the patient improve his health by working with him to set goals and to make a plan to meet these goals. This approach may be particularly beneficial to members with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. To encourage members to receive care at a PCMH, the State Health Plan, beginning January 1, 2016, will not charge Standard Plan members the $12 copayment for a physician office visit. After Savings Plan and Standard Plan subscribers meet their deductible, they will pay 10 percent coinsurance, rather than 20 percent, for services at a BCBSSC-affiliated PCMH. PCMHs are available in many South Carolina counties. To find a list and to learn more about PCMHs, go to StateSC.SouthCarolinaBlues.com. On the home page, select the box labeled \"PCMH.\" Using State Health Plan provider networks When you are ill or injured, you decide where to go for your care. The State Health Plan operates as a preferred provider organization, or PPO. As such, it has networks of physicians and hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers and mammography testing centers. There also are networks available to subscribers for ambulatory surgery centers, durable medical equipment, labs, radiology and X-ray, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, skilled nursing facilities, long term acute care facilities, hospices and dialysis centers. These providers have agreed, as part of the network, to accept the plan's allowed amount for covered benefits as payment in full. Network providers will charge you for your deductible, copayments and coinsurance when the services are provided. They also will file your claims. If you use an out-of-network medical or mental health/substance abuse provider or your physician sends your laboratory tests to an out-of-network provider, you will pay more for your care. Please note: Even if you are at a network hospital or at a network provider's office, the provider may employ out-of-network contract providers or technicians. If an out-of-network provider renders services, even in a network facility, he can still balance bill you, and you will still pay the out-of-network differential. For more information, see Pages 45-46.INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201641 HEALTH INSURANCEIn the United States, prescription drug benefits are paid only if you use a network provider. How to find a medical or mental health/substance abuse network provider To view the online provider directory, go to the BCBSSC state-specific website, StateSC.SouthCarolinaBlues.com, and select \"Find a Doctor.\" Now you can search for a provider by name, location and specialty. You can also search for \"ER Alternatives,\" which list places you can go for care other than an emergency room (i.e., urgent care centers and walk-in clinics). To see only State Health Plan network providers, key in \"ZCS,\" the three letters at the beginning of your benefits identification number. If you do not have Internet access, call BCBSSC at 803.736.1576 (Greater Columbia area) or 800.868.2520 (toll-free) to request a list of State Health Plan providers in your area. BlueCard\u00ae and BlueCard Worldwide\u00ae State Health Plan members have access to doctors and hospitals throughout the United States and around the world through the BlueCard Program and Blue Cross and Blue Shield provider networks. If you are covered by the State Health Plan and need mental health or substance abuse care outside South Carolina, call 800.810.2583. Inside the United StatesWith the BlueCard program, you can choose network doctors and hospitals that suit you best. Follow these steps to use your health coverage when you are away from home but within the United States: 1. Always carry your health plan and your prescription drug identification cards. 2. To find the names and addresses of nearby doctors and hospitals, choose \"Links\" on PEBA's insurance benefits website. Follow the steps above and enter the location where you need a provider. You also may call BlueCard Access at 800.810.2583. 3. State Health Plan subscribers must call Medi-Call within 48 hours of receiving emergency care. The toll-free number is on your State Health Plan identification card. 4. When you arrive at a participating doctor's office or hospital, show your identification card. The provider will recognize the Blue Cross Blue Shield logo, which will ensure that you get the highest level of benefits with no balance billing. 5. The provider should file claims with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliate in the state where the services were provided. You should not have to complete any claim forms, nor should you have to pay up front for medical services other than the usual out-of-pocket expenses (deductibles, copayments, coinsurance and non-covered services). BCBSSC will mail an Explanation of Benefits to you. For information about out-of-network benefits, see Pages 44-46. Outside the United StatesThrough the BlueCard Worldwide\u00ae program, your State Health Plan identification card gives you access to doctors and hospitals in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide and to a broad range of medical services.HEALTH INSURANCE42 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016Please note: Medicare does not offer benefits outside the United States. Since the State Health Plan's Medicare Supplemental Plan does not allow benefits for services not covered by Medicare, Medicare Supplemental Plan subscribers do not have coverage outside the United States. See PEBA's When You Become Eligible for Medicare handbook for more information. To take advantage of the BlueCard Worldwide program, follow these steps: 1. Always carry your State Health Plan identification card. 2. Before your trip: If you have questions, call the phone number on the back of your identification card to check your benefits and for preauthorization, if necessary. (Your health care benefits may be different outside of the United States.) The BlueCard Worldwide Service Center can help you find providers in the area where you are traveling. It can also provide other helpful information about health care overseas. To reach the center, go to PEBA's insurance benefits website at www.eip.sc.gov and go to \"Links\" and select \"Medical/My Health Toolkit BlueShield of a and select \"Worldwide Directory.\" You also may call toll-free at 800.810.2583 or collect at 804.673.1177. 3. During your trip: If you need to find a doctor or hospital or need medical assistance, go to the state BCBSSC website through \"Links\" on the PEBA insurance benefits website at www.eip.sc.gov. Go to \"Find a Doctor\" and select \"Worldwide Directory.\" You must accept the terms and conditions and login with the first three letters of your identification number. Then you may \"Select a Provider Type.\" You also can choose a specialty, city, nation and distance from the city. You may also call the BlueCard Worldwide Service Center toll-free at 800.810.2583 or collect at 804.673.1177 (24 hours a day, seven days a week). If you are admitted to the hospital, call the BlueCard Worldwide Service Center toll-free at 800.810.2583 or collect at 804.673.1177 as soon as possible. The BlueCard Worldwide Service Center will work with your plan to arrange direct billing with the hospital for your inpatient stay. When direct billing is arranged, you are responsible for the out-of-pocket expenses (non-covered services, deductibles, copayments and coinsurance) you normally pay. The hospital will submit your claim on your behalf. Please note: If direct billing is not arranged between the hospital and your plan, you must pay the bill up front and file a claim. For outpatient care and doctor visits, pay the provider when you receive care and file a claim. 4.

Mental health/substance abuse provider network The State Health Plan offers coverage for mental health and substance abuse services on the same terms as medical coverage. Preauthorization is required from Companion Benefit Alternatives (CBA), the mental health and substance abuse benefits manager, for most hospital services and some outpatient services (see Mental Health and Substance Abuse Benefits on Pages 72-74). A greater percentage of the cost of your covered benefits will be paid if you use a network provider. Go to \"Find a Doctor\" on the state BCBSSC website, StateSC.SouthCarolinaBlues.com, to get an up-to-date list of network providers. When you get to the site, enter your \"Location\" and the \"Specialty.\" Be sure to \"view\" the provider's networks. Get a printable version of the directory from the Companion Benefit Alternatives website, CompanionBenefitAlternatives.com, by going to \"Looking for a Mental Health Provider?\" and selecting \"Get Started\" and following the prompts. The directory can be searched using the \"binoculars\" search feature. For help selecting a provider, call Companion Benefit Alternatives at 800.868.1032. To find a provider outside of the United States, select \"Worldwide Directory\" within \"Find a Doctor or Hospital\" link on the state BCBSSC website or call collect 804.673.1177. If you do not have Internet access, contact your benefits office or, if you are a retiree, survivor or COBRA participant, contact BCBSSC, for a printed list of providers. For more information about your mental health and substance abuse benefits, see Pages 72-74. Prescription drug provider network Because the State Health Plan offers no out-of-network coverage for prescription drugs in the United States, it is important that you use a network provider. You can search for a HEALTH INSURANCE44 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016network provider on the pharmacy benefits manager's website, www.Express-Scripts.com. You also can use the mobile application. On the Express Script's website, sign in and go to \"Locate a Pharmacy.\" You can search by ZIP code or city and state. With a mobile device, you can get turn-by-turn directions to the nearest participating retail pharmacy. If you do not have Internet access, ask your benefits administrator to print a list of network pharmacies near you. If you are a retiree, COBRA or survivor subscriber, call Express Scripts for to get a list of network pharmacies near you. Please note: Not all network pharmacies belong to the Retail Maintenance Network, which offers 90-day supplies of drugs at mail-order prices. You can get a list of the Retail Maintenance Network pharmacies from PEBA's insurance benefits website, www.eip.sc.gov, at \"Online Directories\" or from your benefits administrator. For more information, see Pages 70-71. For more information about your prescription drug benefits, see Pages 67-72. Out-of-network benefits You can use providers for medical and mental health/substance abuse care that are not part of the network and still receive some coverage. Before the State Health Plan will pay 100 percent of the plan's allowed amount: For out-of-network benefits, Standard Plan subscribers pay a $5,080 individual coinsurance maximum or a $10,160 family coinsurance maximum after they meet their annual deductible. Savings Plan subscribers pay a $4,800 individual coinsurance maximum or a $9,600 family coinsurance maximum after they meet Standard Plan Network provider Billed charge $5,000 Allowed amount1$4,000 Annual deductible - $445 Allowed amount after annual deductible $3,555 Allowed amount after annual deductible $3,555 x 20%2 Coinsurance, which goes toward your coinsurance maximum$711 deductible + $445 Your total payment $1,156 1Network providers are not allowed to charge more than the allowed amount. 2In this example, the Standard Plan paid 80 percent of the $3,555 allowed amount after the deductible, totaling $2,844. Out-of-network provider Billed charge $5,000 Allowed amount - $4,000 Balance bill1$1,000 Allowed amount $4,000 Annual deductible - $445 Allowed amount after annual deductible $3,555 Allowed amount after annual deductible $3,555 x 40%2 Coinsurance, which goes toward your coinsurance $1,422 Annual deductible $445 Balance bill + $1,000 Your total payment $2,867 1Out-of-network providers can charge you any amount they choose above the allowed amount and bill you the balance above the allowed amount. 2In this example, the Standard Plan paid 60 percent of the $3,555 allowed amount after the deductible, totaling $2,133.INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201645 HEALTH INSURANCEtheir annual deductible. Subscribers to both plans also may have to fill out claim forms. Please note: No benefits will be paid for advanced radiology services (CT, MRI, MRA or PET scans) that are not preauthorized by National Imaging Associates. There is no out-of-network coverage for prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy in the United States. Limited drug coverage is offered to members enrolled in the State Health Plan Prescription Drug Program who become ill while traveling overseas. For more information, see Pages 193-194. Balance billing If you use a provider that is not part of the network, you may be subject to balance billing. When the State Health Plan is your primary coverage, network providers are prohibited from billing you for covered benefits except for copayments, coinsurance and the deductible. However, an out-of-network provider may bill you for more than the plan's allowed amount for the covered benefit, which will increase your out-of-pocket cost. The difference between what the out-of-network provider charges and the allowed amount is called the \"balance bill.\" The balance bill does not contribute toward meeting your annual deductible or coinsurance maximum. Out-of-network differential In addition to balance billing, if you receive services from a provider that does not participate in the State Health Plan, Companion Benefit Alternatives or BlueCard networks, you will pay 40 percent of the allowed amount instead of 20 percent in coinsurance. These examples show how it will cost you more to use an out-of-network Savings Plan Network provider Billed charge $5,000 Allowed amount1$4,000 Annual deductible - $3,600 Allowed amount after annual deductible $400 Allowed amount after annual deductible $400 x 20%2 Coinsurance, which goes toward your coinsurance maximum$80 deductible + $3,600 Your total payment $3,680 1Network providers are not allowed to charge more than the allowed amount. 2In this example, the Savings Plan paid 80 percent of the $400 allowed amount after the deductible, totaling $320. Out-of-network provider Billed charge $5,000 Allowed amount - $4,000 Balance bill1$1,000 Allowed amount $4,000 Annual deductible - $3,600 Allowed amount after annual deductible $400 Allowed amount after annual deductible $400 x 40%2 Coinsurance, which goes toward your coinsurance $160 Annual deductible $3,600 Balance bill + $1,000 Your total payment $4,760 1Out-of-network providers can charge you any amount they choose above the allowed amount and bill you the balance above the allowed amount. 2In this example, the Savings Plan paid 60 percent of the $400 allowed amount after the deductible, totaling $240.HEALTH INSURANCE46 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016provider: In both the following examples, you have subscriber-only coverage under the State Health Plan and you have not met your deductible. The allowed amount is $4,000. The provider charged $5,000 for the service. Managing your medical care Medi-Call With the State Health Plan, some covered services require preauthorization before you receive them. A phone call can get things started. Your health care provider may make the call for you, but it is your responsibility to make sure the call is made. Medi-Call numbers are: 800.925.9724 (South Carolina, nationwide, Canada) 803.699.3337 (Greater Columbia area) 803.264.0183 (fax) Please note: Some medical, mental health/substance abuse and prescription drug benefits require preauthorization. See Page 73 for mental health and Page 70 for prescription drugs. What are the penalties for not calling?If you do not preauthorize treatment when required, you will pay a $200 penalty for each hospital, rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility or mental health/substance abuse admission. In addition, the coinsurance maximum will not apply. You will continue to pay your coinsurance, no matter how much you pay out-of-pocket. How to preauthorize your treatmentYou can reach Medi-Call by phone from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. You may fax information to Medi-Call 24 hours a day; however, Medi-Call will not respond until the next business day. If you send a fax to Medi-Call, provide, at a minimum, this information so the review can begin: Subscriber's name Patient's name Subscriber's benefits identification number or Social Security number Information about the service requested A telephone number at which you can be reached during business hours. Medi-Call promotes high-quality, cost-effective care for you and your covered family members through reviews that assess, plan, implement, coordinate, monitor and evaluate health care options and services required to meet an individual's needs. You must contact Medi-Call at least 48 hours or two working days, whichever is longer, before receiving any of these medical services at any hospital in the United States or Canada: You need any type of inpatient care in a hospital, including admission to a hospital to have a baby 1 Your preauthorized outpatient services result in a hospital admission - you must call again for the hospital admission You need outpatient surgery for a septoplasty (surgery on the septum of the nose) You need outpatient or inpatient surgery for a hysterectomy You need sclerotherapy (vein surgery) performed in an inpatient, outpatient or office settingINSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201647 HEALTH INSURANCE You will receive a new course of chemotherapy or radiation therapy (one-time notification per course) You are admitted to a hospital in an emergency - your admission must be reported within 48 hours or the next working day after a weekend or holiday admission 1 You are pregnant - you are encouraged to notify Medi-Call within the first three months of your pregnancy. (See Pages 48-49 for more information.) You have an emergency admission during pregnancy 2 Your baby is born (if you plan to file a claim for any birth-related expenses) 2 Your baby has complications at birth Before your baby is given Synagis (a drug to protect high-risk babies from respiratory syncytial virus disease) outside of the hospital nursery You are to be, or have been, admitted to a long-term acute care facility, skilled nursing facility, or need home health care, hospice care or would like an alternative treatment plan You need durable medical equipment You or your covered spouse decides to undergo in vitro fertilization, GIFT, ZIFT or any other infertility procedure You or your covered family member needs to be evaluated for a transplant You need inpatient rehabilitative services and related outpatient physical, speech or occupational therapy. 1For mental health or substance abuse services, you must call Companion Benefit Alternatives at 800.868.1032 for preauthorization before a non-emergency admission or, in the case of an emergency admission, within 48 hours or the next working day, whichever is longer. 2Contacting Medi-Call for the delivery of your baby does not add the baby to your health insurance. You must add your child by submitting a completed Notice of Election form and the required documentation, a long-form birth certificate, within 31 days of birth for benefits to be payable. A preauthorization request for any procedure that may be considered cosmetic must be received in writing by Medi-Call seven days before surgery. (Procedures in this category include: blepharoplasty, reduction mammoplasty, panniculectomy, abdominoplasty, rhinoplasty or other nose surgery, etc.) Your physician should include photographs if appropriate. A determination by Medi-Call that a proposed treatment is within generally recognized medical standards and procedures does not guarantee claim payment. Other conditions, including eligibility requirements, other limitations or exclusions, payment of deductibles and other provisions of the plan must be satisfied before BCBSSC makes payment on behalf of the State Health Plan. Remember, if you use an out-of-network provider, you will pay more. Advanced radiology preauthorization: National Imaging Associates The State Health Plan has a process for obtaining preauthorization for CT, MRI, MRA and PET scans. Network South Carolina physicians, radiology (imaging) centers and outpatient hospital radiology centers are responsible for requesting advanced radiology preauthorization from National Imaging Associates. Doctors can get more information on the BCBSSC website, StateSC.SouthCarolinaBlues.com, or by calling 800.444.4311. To request preauthorization over the Internet, providers HEALTH INSURANCE48 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016can go to National Imaging Associate's website, www.RadMD.com. They may also call National Imaging Associates at 866.500.7664, Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., ET. If a subscriber or a covered family member is scheduled to receive a CT, MRI, MRA or PET scan from an out-of-network provider in South Carolina or any provider outside of South Carolina, it is the subscriber's responsibility to make sure his provider calls for preauthorization. A subscriber may begin the process by calling National Imaging Associates at 866.500.7664. The subscriber should be able to give National Imaging Associates the name and phone number of the ordering physician and the name and phone number of the imaging center or the physician who will provide the radiology service. National Imaging Associates will make a decision about non-emergency preauthorization requests within two business days of receiving the request from the provider. If the situation is urgent, a decision will be made within one business day of receiving the request from the provider. The process may take longer, however, if additional clinical information is needed to make a decision. A subscriber can check the status of a preauthorization request online through \"My Health Toolkit\" at StateSC.SouthCarolinaBlues.com. What are the penalties for not calling?If an in-network South Carolina physician or radiology center does not request preauthorization, the provider will not be paid for the service, and he cannot bill the subscriber for the service. If a subscriber or a covered family member receives advanced radiology services from an out-of-network provider in South Carolina or from any provider outside of South Carolina without preauthorization, the provider will not be paid by BCBSSC, and the subscriber will be responsible for the entire bill . Maternity Management If you are a mother-to-be, you are encouraged to enroll and participate in the free maternity management program. Medi-Call administers PEBA's comprehensive maternity management program, \"Coming Attractions.\" This program manages mothers throughout their pregnancy and post-partum care. It also manages Neonatal Intensive Care Unit infants or other babies with special needs until they are 1 year old.

Also, the coinsurance you pay will not count toward your coinsurance maximum. For more information, see Page 46 or call your maternity nurse. For more information about maternity benefits, see Pregnancy and Pediatric Care on Pages 58-59. Wellness Management No-Pay Copay The No-Pay Copay, formerly the Wellness Incentive Program, enables eligible State Health Plan members with cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure or diabetes to qualify for a generic drug copayment waiver, which means 12 months of free generic drugs that treat these conditions. Diabetes testing supplies (glucometer, test strips, control solution, lancet, syringes, pen needles, etc.) purchased at a network pharmacy are also covered at no charge. The waiver can be renewed yearly. This program is designed to encourage participants to take more responsibility for their health and save themselves and the plan money. Employees, retirees, COBRA subscribers and survivors and their covered family members are eligible to qualify if the State Health Plan is their primary insurance. Children are eligible. If a subscriber is enrolled in the Medicare Supplemental Plan but covers family members who are not eligible for Medicare, these dependents are eligible for the program. If Medicare or other coverage becomes primary while a member is receiving the waiver and the member remains enrolled in the State Health Plan Prescription Drug Program, the waiver will continue for the 12-month period, but it will not be extended. If a member enrolls in Express Scripts Medicare\u00ae, the State Health Plan's Medicare Part D program, the waiver ends immediately. Members are identified for one of the qualifying conditions through claims analysis or a preauthorization for services. Members who are eligible will receive a letter or a phone call from BCBSSC explaining the details of the No-Pay Copay program, including how to qualify for the program. When a member meets the requirements to qualify for the waiver, he is sent a letter telling him when he will begin to receive free generic medication. About three months before the waiver ends, he will receive a letter telling him HEALTH INSURANCE50 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016what he needs to do to requalify. If a member loses eligibility, he also receives a letter. For detailed information about the No-Pay Copay program, call BCBSSC Customer Service at 800.868.2520 or go to StateSC.SouthCarolinaBlues.com. If you think you qualify for the program but have not been notified of your eligibility, call 855.838.5897.

Weight Management for AdultsThe BlueCross Weight Management program is designed to help you achieve weight-loss goals through small changes you can make while still getting on with your life. You will receive information about weight management and a confidential survey will help a registered nurse tailor the program to meet your needs. Program candidates are identified through claims analysis, a preauthorization for services, doctor referral or self-referral. BCBSSC Wellness Management, 855.838.5897, is available 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday-Thursday and until 5 p.m. on Friday. If you think you qualify but have not received a letter or would like more information, call 855.838.5897 and select option 2. Healthy Weight for Kids and TeensThis confidential program is for overweight and obese children between the ages of 2 and 17.

Members are enrolled based on medical claims, or they may be referred by a doctor. Also, a parent can enroll his covered child by calling 855.838.5897, option 2. Health Management Program Managing a chronic condition can be difficult; however, studies show you can help control your symptoms by making lifestyle changes and by following your doctor's advice. You can also delay, or even prevent, many of the complications of the disease. The Health Management Program is designed for Standard Plan and Savings Plan subscribers and their covered family members who have diabetes, heart disease or chronic respiratory conditions. BCBSSC selects participants by reviewing medical, pharmacy and laboratory claims. If you are identified as someone who could benefit from the Health Management Program, you are automatically enrolled. You may, however, opt out of the program. As a participant, you will receive a welcome letter that includes the name of and contact information for your BlueCross health coach. Your health coach will be a registered nurse who will help you learn more about your condition and how to manage it. Your health coach will also help you work with your physician to develop a plan to take charge of your illness, contacting you by phone or through the online Personal Health Record. You can contact your health coach as often as you like with questions or to ask for advice. For more information, call 855.838.5897, option 2. If you have diabetes, congestive heart failure or cardiovascular disease, BCBSSC may send you a letter saying you also are eligible for the No-Pay Copay program. About your privacyIn compliance with federal law, your health information will always be kept confidential. INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201651 HEALTH INSURANCEYour employer does not receive the results of any surveys you complete. Enrolling will not affect your health benefits now or in the future. Health Management for Migraine ProgramThis program encourages a member to work with his doctor to create a plan to ease the pain of migraine headaches. A health coach helps the member learn to identify migraine triggers, develop healthy habits to prevent migraines and comply with his treatment plan. Members, who must be at least age 18, are invited to participate based on medical and pharmacy claims. You can also enroll by calling 855.838.5897, option 2. Medical Case Management Facing a serious illness or injury can be confusing and frustrating. You may not know where to find support or information to help you cope with your illness, and you may not know what treatment options are available. Case management can help. The case management programs available to State Health Plan members are explained below. Each program includes teams of specially trained nurses and doctors. Their goal is to assist participants in coordinating, assessing and planning health care. They do so by giving a patient control over his care and respecting his right to knowledge, choice, a direct relationship with his physician, privacy and dignity. None of the programs provide medical treatment. All the programs recognize that, ultimately, decisions about your care are between you and your physician. Each program may involve a home or facility visit to a participant but only with permission. By working closely with your doctor, using your benefits effectively and using the resources in your community, the case management programs may help you through a difficult time. For more information on any of these programs, call 800.925.9724 and ask to be transferred to the case management supervisor. BlueCross Medi-Call Case Management Program This program is designed for State Health Plan members who have specific catastrophic or chronic disorders, acute illnesses or serious injuries. The program facilitates continuity of care and support of these patients while managing health plan benefits in a way that promotes high-quality, cost-effective outcomes. Case managers talk with patients, family members and providers to coordinate services among providers and support the patient through a crisis or chronic disease. Case management intervention may be short- or long-term. Case managers combine standard preauthorization services with innovative approaches for patients who require high levels of medical care and benefits. Case managers can often arrange services or identify community resources available to meet the patient's needs. The case manager works with the patient and the providers to assess, plan, implement, coordinate, monitor and evaluate ways of meeting a patient's needs, reducing readmissions and enhancing quality of life. Your Medi-Call nurse case manager may visit you at home, with your permission, or in a treatment facility or your physician's office when the treatment team determines it is appropriate. A Medi-Call nurse stays in touch with the HEALTH INSURANCE52 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016patient, caregivers and providers to assess and re-evaluate the treatment plan and the patient's progress. All communication between BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina and the patient, family members or providers complies with HIPAA privacy requirements. If a patient refuses medical case management, Medi-Call will continue to preauthorize appropriate treatment. Complex Care Management ProgramSome members are referred to complex care management, a program designed to assist the most seriously ill patients. They may include members with complex medical conditions and frequent hospitalizations or critical barriers to their care. The complex care management program provides you with information and support through a case manager, who is a registered nurse. This nurse coordinator can help you identify treatment options; locate supplies and equipment recommended by your doctor; coordinate care; and research the availability of transportation and lodging for out-of-town treatment. The nurse stays in touch weekly with patients and caregivers to assess and re-evaluate the treatment plan and the patient's progress. This program helps you make informed decisions about your health when you are seriously ill or injured. Participation is voluntary. You can leave the program at any time, for any reason. Your benefits will not be affected by your participation. Here is how the program works: BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina will refer you to the program if it may benefit you. You will receive a letter explaining the program, and a representative will contact you. A team of specially trained nurses and doctors will review your medical information and treatment plan. (Your medical history and information will always be kept confidential among your caregivers and the complex care management team.) Your nurse case manager will be your main contact. You and your doctor, however, will always make the final decision about your treatment. Complex care management does not replace your doctor's care. Always check with your doctor before following any medical advice. Renal Disease Case Management ProgramRenal Disease Case Management provides renal disease management care for select State Health Plan members receiving renal dialysis. This program's nurses provide education and care coordination that may help prevent acute illnesses and hospitalizations. Here is how the program works: Members receiving renal dialysis are referred to the program. A nurse then contacts the individual to confirm that he is a good candidate for renal case management. The nurse, who has many years of renal dialysis experience, provides education and helps coordinate care. As the link between the patient, providers and dialysis team, the nurse identifies the patient's needs through medical record review and consultations with the patient, family and health care team. Needs may be medical, social, behavioral, emotional and financial. The nurse coordinates services based on the long-term needs of the patient and incorporates these needs into a plan agreed upon by the patient, physician(s), dialysis team and other providers. Your nurse will call you frequently and receive updates from your providers. Online health tools My Health ToolkitINSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201653 HEALTH INSURANCEPersonal Health Record Your Personal Health Record, which is on the state BCBSSC website, is safe and secure.

State Health Plan benefits The Standard Plan and the Savings Plan pay benefits for treatment of illnesses and injuries if the Plan of Benefits defines the treatment as medically necessary. This section is a general description of the plan. The Plan of Benefits contains a complete description of the benefits. Its terms and conditions govern all health benefits offered by the state. Contact your benefits administrator or PEBA for more HEALTH INSURANCE54 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016information. Some services and treatment require preauthorization by Medi-Call, National Imaging Associates, Express Scripts or Companion Benefit Alternatives. For details read the Medi-Call section beginning on Page 46, the National Imaging Associates section on Pages 47-48 and the mental health and substance abuse section on Page 73. Within the terms of the State Health Plan, a medically necessary service or supply is: Required to identify or treat an existing condition, illness or injury and Prescribed or ordered by a physician and Consistent with the covered person's illness, injury or condition and in accordance with proper medical and surgical practices in the medical specialty or field of medicine at the time provided and Required for reasons other than the convenience of the patient and Results in measurable, identifiable progress in treating the covered person's condition, illness or injury. The fact that a procedure, service or supply is prescribed by a physician does not automatically mean it is medically necessary under the terms of the State Health Plan. Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Expenses for services received from a licensed, independent Advanced Practice Registered Nurse are covered even if these services are not performed under the immediate direction of a doctor. An Advanced Practice Registered Nurse is a nurse practitioner, certified nurse midwife, certified registered nurse anesthetist or a clinical nurse specialist. All services received must be within the scope of the nurse's license and needed because of a service allowed by the plan. The State Health Plan only recognizes certified nurse midwives as providers of midwife covered services. A certified nurse midwife is an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse licensed as a midwife by the State Board of Nursing or by a sister state having substantially-equivalent licensing standards. The services of lay midwives and midwives licensed by the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control are not reimbursed. Alternative treatment plan An alternative treatment plan is an individual program to permit treatment in a more cost-effective and less intensive manner. An alternative treatment plan requires the approval of the treating physician, Medi-Call and the patient. Services and supplies authorized by Medi-Call as medically necessary because of the approved alternative treatment plan will be covered. Ambulance service Ambulance service, including air ambulance service, is covered to the nearest hospital to obtain medically necessary emergency care. Ambulance service is also covered to transport a member to the nearest hospital that can provide medically necessary inpatient services when those services are not available at the current facility. No benefits are payable for ambulance service used for routine, non-emergency transportation, including, but not limited to, travel to a facility for scheduled medical or surgical treatments, such as dialysis or cancer treatment. All claims for ambulance service are subject to medical review.

Bone, stem cell and solid organ transplants State Health Plan transplant contracting arrangements include the BlueCross BlueShield Association national transplant network, Blue Distinction Centers for Transplants. All Blue Distinction Centers for Transplants facilities meet specific criteria that consider provider qualifications, programs and patient outcomes. All transplant services must be approved by Medi-Call (see Page 46). You must call Medi-Call, even before you or a covered family member is evaluated for a transplant. Through the Blue Distinction Centers for Transplants network, State Health Plan members have access to the leading organ transplant facilities in the nation. Contracts are also in effect with local providers for transplant services so members may receive transplants at those facilities. You will save a significant amount of money if you receive your transplant services at a Blue Distinction Centers for Transplants network facility or a South Carolina network transplant facility. If you receive transplant services at one of these network facilities, you will not be balance billed. You will be responsible only for your deductible, coinsurance and any charges not covered by the plan. In addition, these network facilities will file all claims for you. Transplant services at nonparticipating facilities are covered by the plan; however, the State Health Plan pays only the State Health Plan-allowed amount for transplants performed out-of-network. If you do not receive your transplant services at a network facility, you may pay substantially more. In addition to the deductible and coinsurance, members using out-of-network facilities are responsible for any amount in excess of the allowed amount, or balance bill, and pay 40 percent coinsurance. Costs for transplant care can vary by hundreds of thousands of dollars. If you receive services outside the network, you cannot be assured that your costs will not exceed those allowed by the plan. For information on balance billing, see Page 45. You may also call Medi-Call for more information.

The plan may pay for a shorter stay, however, if the attending physician, after consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also by federal law, group health plans may not set the level of benefits or out-of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the 48-hour (or 96-hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a plan may not require that a physician or other health care provider obtain authorization for prescribing a length of stay of up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). A member may be required to obtain precertification to use certain providers or facilities, or to reduce out-of-pocket costs.

This means that after you spend $2,500 in prescription drug copayments, the plan will pay 100 percent of the allowed amount for your covered prescription drugs for the rest of the year. Drug expenses do not count toward your medical annual deductible or coinsurance maximum. Savings PlanUnder the Savings Plan, you show your pharmacy benefits card the first time you purchase a prescription from a participating retail pharmacy. There are no copayments under the Savings Plan. You pay the full allowed amount for your prescription drugs, HEALTH INSURANCE68 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016and a record of your payment is transmitted electronically to BCBSSC. If you have not met your annual deductible, the full allowed amount for the drug will be credited to it. If you have met your annual deductible, you will pay 20 percent of the allowed amount for the drug. This amount will be credited to your coinsurance maximum. Non-sedating antihistamines and drugs for erectile dysfunction are not covered under the Savings Plan. Express Scripts Medicare\u00ae If you are enrolled in the State Health Plan as an active employee, there are no changes in your prescription drug coverage when you or your covered dependents become eligible for Medicare. PEBA automatically enrolls Medicare-eligible retirees and their Medicare-eligible dependents in Express Scripts Medicare\u00ae, the State Health Plan's Medicare Part D program. However, you have the option to return to the SHP Prescription Drug Program, which covers members who are not eligible for Medicare. For information about Express Scripts Medicare \u00ae, see the 2016 When You Become Eligible for Medicare handbook, which is available online or from PEBA. Features of the Prescription Drug Program Step Therapy Programs This program is designed to encourage use of generics and over-the-counter drugs that are alternatives to some high-volume, high-priced brand-name drugs. For example, omeprazole is a less expensive alternative to Aciphex. If you or your doctor thinks you should not use the lower-cost drug, your prescription may require preauthorization or it may be covered at the Tier 3 (highest cost) rate. You or your doctor may request a coverage review by calling Express Scripts. As part of the process, you may be required to have tried and failed to successfully use the lower-cost drug. If as a result of the review, the drug is approved, The examples below show how pay-the-difference works in the Standard Plan and, if you are covered by the State Health Plan Prescription Drug Program, the Medicare Supplemental Plan: This is what you pay for a Tier 2 (brand) drug when a Tier 1 (generic) drug is not available. Tier 1 (generic) Tier 2 (brand) Allowed amount for the drug N/A $125 Generic copayment N/A N/A Amount you pay N/A $38 (brand copayment only) This is what you pay when a Tier 1 (generic) drug is available and you choose the Tier 2 (brand) drug. Tier 1 (generic) Tier 2 (brand) Allowed amount for the drug $65 $125 Generic copayment $9 N/A Amount you would have paid had you chosen the generic drug$9 (generic copayment only) Amount you pay because you chose the brand drug$69 (generic copayment [$9] plus difference between allowed amount for generic drug and brand drug [$60])INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201669 HEALTH INSURANCEit will be covered at the appropriate tier. If approval is denied, your health plan will not cover the drug. For more information, call Express Scripts at 855.612.3128. Tiers determine prescription drug costMembers covered by the Standard Plan and Express Scripts Medicare\u00ae pay copayments for drugs. Tier 1 (Generic \u2014 $9 copayment)Generic drugs may differ in color, size or shape, but the FDA requires that the active ingredients be the chemical equivalent of the brand-name alternative and have the same strength, purity and quality. Because generic drugs have a lower copayment, you typically get the same health benefits for less. You may wish to ask your doctor to mark \"substitution permitted\" on your prescription. If he does not, your pharmacist will have no choice but to give you the brand-name drug if that is the drug your doctor wrote on the prescription. Tier 2 (Brand \u2014 $38 copayment)These are drugs Express Scripts' Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee has determined to be safe, effective and available at a lower cost than Tier 3 drugs. The list may be updated during the year. It is available online at www.Express-Scripts.com. You may also reach the Express Scripts website through the PEBA insurance benefits website by clicking on \"Links\" and then \"Prescription Drugs (Express Scripts).\" Tier 3 (Brand \u2014 $63 copayment)These medications carry a higher copayment or higher price. Tier 3 contains drugs that may be considered preferred or non-preferred on the formulary, the list of prescription drugs approved by your plan.Pay-the-difference policy The State Health Plan has a \"pay-the- difference\" policy. If you purchase a brand-name drug when an FDA-approved generic equivalent is available, the payment will be limited to what the plan would have paid for the generic equivalent. This policy will apply even if the doctor prescribes the drug as \"Dispense as Written\" or \"Do Not Substitute.\" With the Standard Plan and the Medicare Supplemental Plan,* if you purchase a Tier 2 or Tier 3 (brand) drug over a Tier 1 (generic) drug, you will be charged the generic copayment plus the difference between the allowed amounts for the brand drug and the generic drug. If the total amount is less than the Tier 2 or Tier 3 (brand) copayment, you will pay the brand copayment. Only the copayment for the Tier 1 (generic) drug will apply toward a member's annual prescription drug copayment maximum. *The pay-the-difference policy does not apply to members covered by Express Scripts Medicare\u00ae the State Health Plan's Medicare Part D program. Savings Plan members do not pay copayments; however, they usually save money by buying generic drugs because these drugs typically cost less. With the Savings Plan, if you purchase a Tier 2 or Tier 3 (brand) drug over a Tier 1 (generic) drug, only the allowed amount for the generic drug will apply toward your deductible. After you have met your deductible, only the patient's 20 percent share of the allowed amount for the generic drug will apply toward your coinsurance maximum. If you are taking a Tier 2 or Tier 3 drug, you may wish to ask your doctor about using a generic drug, if one is available. If appropriate, the doctor may note on the prescription that substitution is permitted. Compound prescriptions HEALTH INSURANCE70 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016A compound prescription is a medication that requires a pharmacist to mix two or more drugs, based on a doctor's prescription, when such a medication is not available from a manufacturer. The prescription must be medically necessary and studied for use in this type of preparation. It must also be purchased from a participating pharmacy. In order to be sure that your compound is covered under your plan, the pharmacist should submit this to ESI electronically. If one ingredient in the compound is not covered, the preparation is not covered by the plan and will have no reimbursement. The pharmacist will receive information on coverage of ingredients and in some situations can substitute other covered items to create your preparation. If your compound is not covered, you should discuss commercially available products with your physician. If a network pharmacy does not file your claim, you must pay the entire cost of the prescription and then submit a claim to Express Scripts. Information on how to file a claim to Express Scripts is on Pages 193-194. Claims must be accompanied by an itemized list of the ingredients. This information allows Express Scripts to process your claim based on the actual ingredients in the medication. Ask your pharmacist to provide you with this list when you fill your prescription. Please be sure it includes: The name of each ingredient The valid National Drug Code for each ingredient The quantity of each ingredient When you file your own claim, your reimbursement may be less than what you paid for the drug because it will be limited to the plan's allowed amount minus the copayment for the actual ingredients in the compound prescription. Prescriptions filled at out-of-network pharmacies will not be reimbursed. If the prescription is not covered by the plan, there will be no reimbursement. The way to avoid this is for the pharmacist to submit the compound electronically and collect the appropriate copayment at the time of dispensing. Prior authorizationSome medications will be covered by the plan only if they are prescribed for certain uses. These drugs must be authorized in advance, or they will not be covered under the plan. If the prescribed medication requires prior authorization, you, your doctor or your pharmacist may begin the review process by contacting Express Scripts at 855.612.3128. Retail pharmacies You must use a participating pharmacy and you must show your health plan identification card when purchasing medications. Most major pharmacy chains and independent pharmacies participate in the network. If you are enrolled in the State Health Plan, you may get a list of network pharmacies from the PEBA insurance benefits website, www.eip.sc.gov, by selecting \"Online Directories\" and then \"State Health Plan Pharmacy Locator.\" You will need to register and sign in. You may also get a list of network pharmacies from your benefits administrator. Retail Maintenance Network - save money locally If you are enrolled in the SHP Prescription Drug Program or Express Scripts Medicare\u00ae, you may buy up to 90-day supplies of prescription drugs at mail-order prices at local pharmacies belonging to the Retail INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201671 HEALTH INSURANCEMaintenance Network. You pay the same copayment as you would pay through mail order. The discount applies only to prescriptions filled for a 63-90 day supply. Copayments for prescriptions filled for a 0-62 day supply at these retail pharmacies remain the same. The copayments also remain the same at all other network pharmacies. A list of the pharmacies is on the PEBA insurance benefits website, www.eip.sc.gov, under \"Online Directories.\" If you do not have Internet access, ask your benefits administrator to print the list for you or contact Express Scripts at 855.612.3128. Mail-order: another way to save time and money The State Health Plan Prescription Drug Program and Express Scripts Medicare\u00ae offer home delivery for 90-day supplies of prescriptions through Express Scripts Pharmacy. By using this service, you receive a discount on the same FDA-approved prescription drugs that you would buy at a retail pharmacy. Mail order is an ideal option for anyone with a recurring prescription, such as birth control medicine, or a chronic condition, such as asthma, high cholesterol or high blood pressure. Some controlled substances may not be available by mail. Please call Express Scripts before submitting your prescription. You can also get a 90-day supply of your maintenance medications at mail-order prices through the Retail Maintenance Network, which allows you to use a network pharmacy near you. Be sure to ask your physician to write your prescription for a 90-day supply. If you have any questions before you order a 90-day supply of a medication, call Express Scripts at 855.612.3128.Standard Plan and the Medicare Supplemental Plan The copayments for up to a 90-day supply are: Tier 1 (generic) - $22 Tier 2 (brand) - $95 Tier 3 (brand) - $158 Savings PlanYou pay the full allowed amount when you order prescription drugs through the mail; however, the cost for a 90-day supply will typically be less than you would pay at a retail pharmacy unless you use the Retail Maintenance Network. How to order drugs by mailHere is how fill a prescription through Express Scripts Pharmacy by mail: Ask your doctor to write a new prescription for a 90-day supply of the medication with refills, as appropriate. You may also want to ask him to write a prescription for 31-day supply of the drug, which you can fill at a retail pharmacy and use until you receive your drugs in the mail. Complete a home delivery prescription form, or have your physician e-prescribe the prescription to ESI mail order. If you have set up an online profile, the method of payment can be selected in advance and ESI will send you an email on the receipt of your new prescription and begin dispensing. You may pay by check, money order or major credit card. If you prefer to pay by credit card, you may want to sign up for Express Scripts' automatic payment program. Mail the prescription, the order form and the payment to Express Scripts in HEALTH INSURANCE72 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016the return envelope provided in your welcome kit. Additional home delivery forms are available from Express Scripts Customer Service or at www.Express-Scripts.com. Here is how to fill a prescription by fax: Ask your doctor to write a new prescription for a 90-day supply of the medication with refills, as appropriate. Give your doctor your member identification number, which is on the front of your pharmacy benefits card. If your doctor asks how to fax your prescription to Express Scripts, suggest he call 888.327.9791. Ask your doctor to fax your prescription to 800.837.0959. Your mail order prescription(s) will be sent to your home, typically within 10-14 business days. Coordination of benefits The State Health Plan coordinates prescription drug benefits as well as medical benefits. This ensures that if you are covered by more than one health plan, both plans pay their share of the cost of your care. See Pages 38-40 for more information. Exclusions Some prescription drugs are not covered under the plan. See Page 59 for more information. Mental health and substance abuse benefits For customer service and information about claims for mental health and/or substance abuse care, call BCBSSC at 800.868.2520. How are mental health/substance abuse claims filed? Claims for mental health and substance abuse are subject to the same copayments, deductibles, coinsurance and coinsurance maximums as medical claims. There is no limit on the number of provider visits allowed as long as the care is medically necessary under the terms of the plan. There is not an annual or lifetime maximum for mental health and substance abuse benefits. If you use a network provider, the provider is responsible for submitting claims. If you receive care from a provider that is not a member of the network, see Page 192 for information about how to file a claim. Your mental health and substance abuse provider will be required to conduct periodic medical necessity reviews (similar to Medi-Call for medical benefits). The mental health/substance abuse provider network Medically necessary mental health and substance abuse services are covered when rendered by network and out-of-network providers. Just like benefits for medical services, a higher percentage of the cost of your care is covered if you use network services. The most up-to-date list of providers is on the state BCBSSC website, StateSC.SouthCarolinaBlues.com. Click on the \"Find a Provider\" link in the \"Find a Doctor\" box and follow the instructions. To see a printable directory of network providers in South Carolina and surrounding counties in Georgia and North Carolina, go to provider.bcbs.com and follow the instructions. To learn more INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201673 HEALTH INSURANCEabout how to use these directories, see Page 40 and Page 43. Lists of providers from the directory are available from your benefits office or, if you are a retiree, survivor or COBRA subscriber, from BCBSSC. If you have questions about network providers, call BCBSSC. If you use an out-of-network provider, you will pay more. For preauthorization and case management - 800.868.1032 Preauthorization and case management of mental health and substance abuse benefits are handled by Companion Benefit Alternatives, the State Health Plan's mental health/substance abuse benefits manager. Office visits to a mental health or substance abuse provider, such as a psychologist, a clinical social worker or a professional counselor, do not require preauthorization unless they are one of the services listed below. These services must be preauthorized by Companion Benefit Alternatives: Inpatient hospital care Intensive outpatient hospital care Partial hospitalization care Outpatient electroconvulsive therapy - hospital and physician services Repetitive transcranial magnetic therapy Applied behavior analysis therapy Psychological/neuropsychological testing To preauthorize services, your provider must call Companion Benefit Alternatives at 800.868.1032 before you are admitted or, in an emergency situation, within 48 hours or the next working day. For professional services listed above, your provider must call before services are rendered. To assess medical necessity, Companion Benefit Alternatives will require clinical information from the mental health or substance abuse provider treating you. Although your provider may make the call for you, it is your responsibility to see that the call is made and the preauthorization has been granted. A determination by Companion Benefit Alternatives does not guarantee payment. Other conditions, including eligibility requirements, other limitations and exclusions, payment of deductibles and other provisions of the plan must be satisfied before BCBSSC makes payment. What are the penalties for not calling Companion Benefit Alternatives for preauthorization? Mental health professional services If mental health and substance abuse outpatient services that require preauthorization (i.e., Applied Behavior Analysis Therapy and Psychological/Neuropsychological Testing) are not preauthorized, they will not be covered. Facility servicesIf your provider does not call Companion Benefit Alternatives when required, you will pay a $200 penalty for each hospital admission. In addition, the coinsurance maximum will not apply. You will continue to pay your coinsurance, no matter how much you pay out-of-pocket. Case managementCase management is designed to support members with catastrophic or chronic illnesses. Participants are assigned a case manager, who will help educate them on the options and services available to meet their HEALTH INSURANCE74 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016mental health and substance abuse needs and assist in coordinating services. Case managers are licensed nurses and social workers. They assist members by answering questions and helping them get the most out of their mental health, medical and pharmacy benefits. This may include care planning, patient/family education, benefits review and coordinating other services and community resources. Covered members enrolled in this program receive access to a personal case manager, educational resources and web tools that help them learn more about their health and how they can better manage their condition. Participation is voluntary and confidential. Quit For Life\u00ae Program The research-based Quit For Life\u00ae Program is brought to you by the American Cancer Society \u00ae and Alere Wellbeing. It is available at no charge to State Health Plan subscribers, their covered spouses and covered dependents age 13 or older.

The drugs must be obtained from a network provider. Registration is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Quit Coaches also are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week (except on certain holidays). If you still need help after the 12-month program ends, you may re-enroll.

The TRICARE Other Health Insurance form for each region is on the TRICARE website, www.tricare.mil. Fax the completed forms to TRICARE at the number on the form. Remember, the TRICARE Supplement Plan is not considered other health insurance. Upon enrollment, you will receive a packet with your certificate of insurance, identification card, claim forms and instructions on how to file claims. In addition to enrolling in the TRICARE Supplement Plan, during open enrollment, if you're an eligible subscriber, you may drop TRICARE Supplement Plan coverage for yourself or your dependents, or add dependents. See Page 15 for more information. Plan features The TRICARE Supplement Plan provides you with additional coverage, which, when combined with the other TRICARE coverage, usually pays 100 percent of your out-of-pocket expenses. Some of the plan's features include: No deductibles, coinsurance or out-of-pocket expenses for covered services You may choose any TRICARE-authorized provider, including network, non-network, participating and nonparticipating providers. For more information, see the TRICARE Supplement Plan Member Handbook. Reimbursement of prescription drug copayments.

There is no employer contribution; however, your premiums may be paid before taxes are deducted from your paycheck through the MoneyPlus Pretax Group Insurance Premium Feature. Filing claimsMost providers submit TRICARE Supplement Plan claims. If a provider does not, you HEALTH INSURANCE82 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016may submit the claims to Selman & Company. Detailed information about filing doctor/hospital and pharmacy claims is included in the welcome packet and on the Selman & Company website, www.selmantricareresource.com/SC. The claim form is in the welcome packet and on the website, www.selmantricareresource.com, in \"Member Resources.\" PortabilityThe TRICARE Supplement Plan is portable. If you leave your job, you can continue coverage by paying the premiums directly to Selman & Company. Medicare eligibility and the TRICARE Supplement Plan If, as an active employee, survivor or retiree, you become eligible for Medicare Part A, you must purchase Medicare Part B to remain eligible for TRICARE. Your TRICARE health benefit changes to TRICARE for Life, a Medicare supplement and your TRICARE Supplement Plan coverage ends. You may continue the supplement plan coverage for your eligible dependents by making premium payments directly to Selman & Company. Contact Selman & Company for details. If a dependent becomes eligible for Medicare before the active employee, survivor or retiree, the dependent is no longer eligible for the GEA TRICARE Supplement Plan. Loss of TRICARE eligibility The TRICARE Supplement Plan pays after TRICARE pays. Therefore, if an employee, spouse or dependent child loses TRICARE eligibility, TRICARE Supplement Plan coverage ends. Dependents who lose TRICARE eligibility are not eligible for continued TRICARE Supplement Plan coverage through COBRA or on portability. Loss of TRICARE eligibility is a special eligibility situation that permits an eligible employee or retiree and his dependents, if the dependents are otherwise eligible for PEBA insurance coverage, to enroll in health, dental and vision coverage. Basic Life Insurance and Basic Long Term Disability Insurance are provided free to active employees who enroll in the State Health Plan or the TRICARE Supplement Plan. Loss of a spouse's TRICARE eligibility A spouse may lose TRICARE eligibility due to a divorce. When this occurs, he also loses eligibility to continue coverage under the TRICARE Supplement Plan. Loss of a dependent child's TRICARE eligibility A dependent child loses TRICARE eligibility at age 21 if he is not enrolled in school on a full-time basis. A dependent also loses eligibility at midnight on his 23rd birthday, regardless of whether or not he is a full-time student, or on the date he graduates from college, whichever comes first. An adult dependent child enrolled in TRICARE Young Adult loses eligibility at midnight the night of his 26th birthday or the date he fails to pay full premiums to his TRICARE regional contractor.

That is why PEBA offers the State Dental Plan, which helps offset your dental expenses, and Dental Plus, a supplement to the State Dental Plan. To participate in Dental Plus, you must enroll in the State Dental Plan and cover the same family members under both plans. State Dental Plan The State Dental Plan offers these levels of treatment: diagnostic and preventive; basic; prosthodontics; and orthodontics. They are described on the next page. The lifetime orthodontics payment is $1,000 for each covered child age 18 and younger. State Dental Plan benefits are paid based on the allowed amounts for each dental procedure listed in the plan's Schedule of Dental Procedures and Allowed Amounts. Be aware that your dentist's charge may be greater than the allowed amount. The maximum yearly benefit for the State Dental Plan alone is $1,000 for each subscriber or covered person. The State Dental Plan deductible is $25 annually for each covered person who has dental services under Class II or Class III. The deductible for family coverage is limited to three per family per year, $75. Dental Plus Dental Plus covers the first three levels of treatment at the same percentage as the State Dental Plan. However, the allowed amount is higher. Dental Plus does not cover orthodontics. However, members enrolled in Dental Plus must also be covered by the State Dental Plan. That plan offers a $1,000 lifetime orthodontics benefit for each covered child age 18 and younger. See the chart on Page 98 for more information. Under Dental Plus, payment for a covered service is based on the lesser of the dentist's charge and the Dental Plus allowed amount. The allowances may differ for services rendered by a network dentist versus a non-network dentist. You are only responsible for any deductibles and coinsurance, plus any non-covered services, that apply for services rendered by a network dentist. You will be responsible for the difference (plus deductibles and coinsurance) between the payment and charge for all services rendered by a non-network dentist. Premiums are on Pages 184-190.BCBSSC offers dentists in South Carolina agreements to accept the lesser of their usual charge or the Dental Plus allowed amount. For a list of network dentists, go to StateSC.SouthCarolinaBlues.com and select \"Find a Dentist\" under the \"Find a Doctor\" section. Enter your location. Select \"Advanced Search\" on the main screen and follow the prompts. If your dentist has not accepted BCBSSC's Members may enroll in or drop the State Dental Plan and Dental Plus: During initial enrollment in PEBA's insurance benefits coverage During open enrollment in an odd-numbered year. The next opportunity will be October 2017. Within 31 days of a special eligibility situation, which is also referred to as a \"change in status\" in the dental plan. Special eligibility situations are explained on Pages 16-23.DENTAL INSURANCE86 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016agreement, your benefits under Dental Plus will not be reduced. However, you will be responsible for the difference between your dentist's charge and the Dental Plus allowed amount plus deductibles and coinsurance. The maximum yearly benefit for a person covered by both the State Dental Plan and Dental Plus is $2,000. There are no additional deductibles under Dental Plus. However, the State Dental Plan deductible is subtracted from the Dental Plus payment, when applicable. BCBSSC processes State Dental Plan and Dental Plus claims. Its address is P.O. Box 100300, Columbia, SC 29202-3300. Its Customer Service 888.214.6230 or 803.264.7323. The fax number is 803.264.7739. Not all dental procedures are covered. Reimbursement is based on the lesser of the dentist's actual charge or the plan's allowed amount, the most the plan allows for a covered service. Please see Page 92-93 for more information. How to file a dental claim The easiest way to file a claim is to assign benefits to your dentist. Assigning benefits means that you authorize your dentist to file claims for you and to receive payment from the plan(s). To do this, show a staff member in your dentist's office your dental identification card and ask that the claim be filed for you. Be sure to sign the payment authorization block of the claim form. Your dentist will be paid directly.If you are covered under Dental Plus, BCBSSC will process your claims under the State Dental Plan and then under Dental Plus. You do not have to submit additional claims. If you are covered under the State Dental Plan and Dental Plus, you will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from each plan. State Dental Plan EOBs have \"State Dental Plan\" on the front page, and the claim number normally begins with a \"T.\" \"Dental Plus Plan\" is printed in the same place on the Dental Plus EOBs, and the claim number normally begins with a \"V.\" The numbers after the letter, or first digit, should be the same for both claims. Special provisions of the State Dental Plan Alternate forms of treatment If you or your dentist selects a more expensive or personalized treatment, the plan will cover the less costly procedure that is consistent with sound professional standards of dental care. BCBSSC uses guidelines based on usually and customarily provided services and standards of dental care to determine benefits and/or denials. Your dentist may bill you for the difference between his charges for the more costly procedure and what the plan allows for the alternate procedure. The plan will not allow you to apply the payment for the alternate procedure to the cost of the more expensive procedure, if the more expensive procedure is not a covered benefit. Examples of when a less costly procedure may apply are: An amalgam (silver-colored) filling is less costly than a composite (white) filling placed in a posterior (rear) tooth. Porcelain fused to a predominantly base metal crown is less costly than porcelain fused to a noble metal crown. If your dentist will not file your claims, see Page 193 for information about how to file a claim.INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201687 DENTAL INSURANCEDental benefits at a glance Class PlanCovered benefitsAnnual deductiblePercent coveredMaximum payment I Diagnostic and preventiveState scaling of space x-raysNone100% of allowed amount$1,000 per person each year; combined for Classes I, II and III State Dental Plan with Dental PlusNone100% of allowed amount $2,0002 per person each year; combined for Classes I, II and III IIBasic periodontal procedures$25 per person.

To do this, you and your dentist should fill out a claim form before any work is done. The form should list the services to be performed and the charge for each one. Mail the claim form to BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, State Dental Claims Department, P.O. Box 100300, Columbia, SC 29202-3300. Emergency treatment does not need a Pretreatment Estimate. You and your dentist will receive a Pretreatment Estimate form, which will show what part of the expenses your dental plan will cover. This form can be used to file for payment as the work is completed. Just fill in the date(s) of service, ask your dentist to sign the form and submit it to BCBSSC. Your Pretreatment Estimate is valid for one year from the date of the form. However, the date of service may affect the payment allowed. For example, if you have reached your maximum yearly payment when you have the service performed or if you no longer have dental coverage, you will not receive the amount that was approved on the Pretreatment Estimate form. If the State Dental Plan is your secondary insurance, the Pretreatment Estimate will not reflect the estimated coordinated payment, because BCBSSC will not know what your primary insurance will pay. Exclusions: Dental benefits not offered There are some dental benefits that the State Dental Plan and Dental Plus do not offer. The dental plan document lists all exclusions. The list below includes many of them. You may wish to take it with you when you discuss treatment with your dentist.

Orthodontic services after the month a covered child becomes ineligible for orthodontic coverage. Please note: Dental Plus does not provide additional benefits for orthodontic services. Coordination of benefits If you are covered by more than one dental plan, you may file a claim for reimbursement from both plans. Coordination of benefits enables both plans' administrators to work together to give you the maximum benefit allowed. However, the sum of the combined payments will never be more than the allowed amount for your covered dental procedures. (The allowed amount is the amount the State Dental Plan lists for each dental procedure in the Schedule of Dental Procedures and Allowed Amounts. Dental Plus allowed amounts are higher.) When your state dental coverage is secondary, it pays up to the allowed amount of your state dental coverage minus what the primary plan paid. Certain oral surgical procedures are covered under the State Health Plan and State Dental Plans. The most common of these is the surgical removal of impacted teeth. Benefits are applied under the State Health Plan and then coordinated under the State Dental Plan and under Dental Plus, if the member is covered by that plan. The amount paid under the dental plan(s) may be reduced based on the State Health Plan payment, as explained in the last sentence of the paragraph above. You will never receive more from your state dental coverage than the maximum yearly benefit, which is $1,000 for a person covered by the State Dental Plan and $2,000 for a person covered by both the State Dental Plan and Dental Plus. The maximum lifetime benefit for orthodontic services is $1,000, and it is limited to covered children age 18 and younger.

Code of Laws, as amended. Claim example (using Class III procedure) Under the State Dental Plan and Dental Plus, Class III dental benefits (prosthodontics) are paid at 50 percent of the allowed amount after the $25 deductible is met. The table below shows how the plans work together using a crown (porcelain with predominantly base metal) as an example. The example assumes the $25 deductible has been met. The Dental Plus payment is based on the current allowed amount for the Columbia area and may differ slightly depending on where your dentist is located. The Dental Plus allowed amounts are updated yearly. 2016 Dental Plus reimbursement What is the incentive for you to seek dental treatment from a network provider beginning in 2016? Deeper discounts Lower out of pocket expenses Your $2,000 annual maximum payment going further toward necessary treatment The network and non-network allowances may vary by dentist and/or location.State Dental Plan only Dentist's charge $1,150 Allowance $409.60 State Dental Plan payment (50% of the allowed amount)$204.80 You pay $945.20INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 201693 DENTAL INSURANCEAdult cleaning rendered by a network dentist Charge $82 Allowance $61 (average) Payment $61 You pay $0 You save $21 of your annual benefits Adult cleaning rendered by an out-of-network dentist Charge $82 Allowance $82 (average) Payment $82 You pay $0 You lose $21 of your annual benefits How coordination of benefits works with dental coverage Example one This example uses an adult cleaning, a Class I procedure, which has no deductible and is payable at 100 percent of the allowed amount. The Dental Plus payment is based on the current allowed amount for the Columbia area and may differ slightly based on where your dentist is located. Dental Plus allowed amounts are updated yearly. Example one Dentist's charge $100 Benefit payable under primary plan (assuming $60 is the allowed amount and payable at 100%)$60 Benefit payable if the State Dental Plan were primary ($30.10, the allowed amount, is payable at 100%)$30.10 State Dental Plan's secondary payment $0 No benefit is payable under the State Dental Plan, since the sum of total benefits paid under all dental plans cannot exceed the State Dental Plan allowed amount of $30.10. You pay if you have primary coverage and State Dental Plan coverage$40 Dental Plus allowed amount $82 Dental Plus secondary payment $22An additional $22 is payable if you have Dental Plus, due to higher Dental Plus allowed amount of $82.

So, the secondary payment would be $0 in the above example if your dentist is in that plan's network because that plan's allowance would be paid at 100% and the dentist writes off the difference in his charge and the allowance. Example two This example uses a porcelain crown fused to a predominantly metal base, a Class III procedure for which the deductible has been paid and which is payable at 50 percent of the allowed amount. The Dental Plus payment is based on the current out of network allowed amount for the Columbia area and may differ based on where your dentist is located. Dental Plus will coordinate up to the allowed amount and that amount is determined by where the dentist is located and whether he is in or out of network. For more information about coordination of benefits, including how to determine which plan pays first, see page 20 and page 54. If your state dental coverage is secondary, you must send the Explanation of Benefits you receive from your primary plan with your claim to BCBSSC.

It is also a significant part of your overall health. A yearly eye exam can help detect serious illnesses, such as high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes. That is why the South Carolina Public Employee Benefit Authority (PEBA) offers vision care benefits through the State Vision Plan, which is a fully-insured product provided through EyeMed Vision Care \u00ae. State Vision Plan The State Vision Plan is available to eligible employees, retirees, survivors, permanent, part-time teachers and COBRA subscribers and their covered family members. Subscribers pay the premium without an employer contribution. Premiums are listed on Pages 184-190. The program covers comprehensive eye examinations, frames, lenses and lens options, and contact lens services and materials. It also offers discounts on additional pairs of eyeglasses and contact lenses. A discount of 15 percent on the retail price and 5 percent on a promotional price is offered on LASIK and PRK vision correction through the U.S. Laser Network. Medical treatment of your eyes, such as eye diseases or surgery, is covered by your health plan. Discounts on services may not be available at all participating providers. Before your appointment, please check with your provider to determine whether discounts are offered. Please note: A benefit may not be combined with any discount, promotional offering or other group benefit plan. The sales tax on any benefit, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses, is not covered by the State Vision Plan.The importance of eye exams Eye exams are important for good health. A comprehensive eye exam not only detects the need for vision correction, but it can also reveal early signs of many medical conditions, including diabetes and high blood pressure.

The contract for the life insurance program consists of the policy, which is issued to PEBA Insurance Benefits; PEBA Insurance Benefits' application and your application, if required. The policy is held by PEBA Insurance Benefits. This section of the Insurance Benefits Guide is the summary of your coverage. Changes in the insurance contract The insurance contract may be changed at any time as long as Securian and PEBA agree on the change. No one else has the authority to change the contract. Changes in the contract may affect any class of insured people and do not require your or your beneficiary's consent. All changes must be in writing, made a part of the policy and signed by an official of Securian and of PEBA. Applications The Notice of Election (NOE) and/or Evidence of Insurability form that you complete to be covered by this plan are considered your application for life insurance coverage. Securian may use misstatements or omissions in your application to contest the validity of insurance or to deny a claim. Securian will not use your application to contest insurance that has been in force for two years or more during your lifetime. The two-year period can be extended for fraud or as otherwise allowed by law.Except for fraud or the non-payment of premiums, after the insured's insurance has been in force during his lifetime for two years from the effective date of his coverage, Securian cannot contest the insured's coverage. However, if there has been an increase in the amount of insurance for which the insured was required to apply or for which Securian required evidence of insurability, then, to the extent of the increase, any loss that occurs within two years of the effective date of the increase will be contestable. Any statements that the insured makes in his application will, in the absence of fraud, be considered representations (true at the time) and not warranties (true at the time and will remain true in the future). Also, any statement an insured makes will not be used to void his insurance, nor defend against a claim, unless the statement is contained in the application. Cafeteria Plan (MoneyPlus) election restrictions This policy is part of a cafeteria plan (MoneyPlus) sponsored by your employer and governed by the requirements of Sections 105, 125 and 129 of the Internal Revenue Code. The rules of the cafeteria plan will supersede any parts of the policy that are in conflict with them. By law, cafeteria plans are subject to these restrictions: The benefits you elect during the enrollment period will remain in Life insurance offered through PEBA is term life insurance.

If a dependent is hospitalized or confined because of illness or disease on the date his insurance would otherwise become effective, his effective date shall be delayed until he is released from such hospitalization or confinement. This does not apply to a newborn child. However, in no event will insurance on a dependent be effective before the subscriber's insurance is effective. Dependent Life benefits Dependent Life-Spouse coverage and Dependent Life-Child coverage are separate programs for which a subscriber pays separate premiums.

However, an employee who is not enrolled or is enrolled for $10,000, $20,000 or $30,000 of Optional Life coverage can only enroll his spouse for $10,000 or $20,000. Evidence of insurability is required for all amounts of more than $20,000 and for coverage not elected when the dependent first becomes eligible under the plan or due to a special eligibility situation.

Deductible income includes: sick pay or other salary continuation (including sick-leave pool); primary Social Security benefits; workers' compensation; other group disability benefits (except SLTD benefits, which are described on page 144); maximum plan retirement benefits; etc. In addition, TERI funds, at the time you receive them, are deductible income back to the time you began receiving disability benefits. For example, your BLTD benefit, before reduction by deductible income, is 62.5 percent of your covered pre-disability earnings, with a maximum monthly amount of $800. The benefit will then be reduced by the amount of any deductible income you receive or are eligible to receive. The total of the reduced benefit, plus the deductible income, will provide at least 62.5 percent of your covered predisability earnings, but no more than $800 a month. You are required to meet deadlines for applying for all deductible income you are eligible to receive. PEBA Retirement Benefits has different requirements for disability retirement. Please contact PEBA for more information. When other benefits are awarded, they may include payments due to you while you were receiving BLTD benefits. If the award includes past benefits, or if you receive other income before notifying The Standard, your BLTD claim may be overpaid. This is because you received benefits from the plan and income from another source for the same period of time. You will be required to repay the plan for this overpayment. When benefits end Your benefits end automatically on the earliest of these dates: The date you are no longer disabled under the terms of the BLTD plan The date your maximum benefit period ends (refer to \"Exclusions and Limitations\" on Pages 129-130) The date benefits become payable under any other group long term disability insurance policy under which you became insured during a period of temporary recovery The date of your death.

Consider these statistics: Just over 1 in 4 of today's 20-year-olds will become disabled before they retire. 1 More than 37 million Americans are classified as disabled; about 12 percent of the total population. More than 50 percent of those disabled Americans are in their working years, from age 18 to age 64. 2 65 percent of working Americans say they could not cover normal living expenses even for a year if their employment income were lost; 38 percent could not pay their bills for more than three months. 3 As noted above, many people would not be able to meet their financial obligations if they became disabled and could not work for an extended period of time. PEBA Insurance Benefits offers an optional disability insurance plan that provides additional protection for you and your family. This program, Supplemental Long Term Disability Insurance (SLTD), is fully-insured by Standard Insurance Company (The Standard) and is not under PEBA's administration. 1U.S. Social Security Administration, Fact Sheet February 7, 2013. 2U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2011. 3Council for Disability Awareness, Disability Divide Consumer Disability Awareness Study, 2010.

MoneyPlus offers tax-favored accounts, IRS- approved, tax-free benefits. If you are an active employee, these accounts save you money on eligible medical and dependent care costs by enabling you to pay these expenses with funds deducted from your salary before it is taxed. MoneyPlus is governed by Sections 105, 125, 129 and 223 of the Internal Revenue Service code. WageWorks, Inc., is the program's third-party claims processor. Each account has an administrative charge, which is designed to be minimal compared to your tax savings. Pretax premiums The Pretax Group Insurance Premium Feature allows you to pay premiums for the State Health Plan (including the tobacco-use surcharge), the TRICARE Supplement Plan, the State Dental Plan, Dental Plus, the State Vision Plan, and Optional Life (for coverage up to $50,000) before taxes are taken from your paycheck. Flexible Spending Accounts Through MoneyPlus you can pay eligible medical and dependent care expenses with money you set aside before it is taxed. You authorize deposits to your MoneyPlus account, which occur every pay period. As you have eligible expenses, you request tax-free withdrawals from your account to reimburse yourself. There are three Flexible Spending Accounts: a Dependent Care Spending Account (DCSA), a Medical Spending Account (MSA) and a Limited-use Medical Spending Account, which can accompany a Health Savings Account (HSA). (Members enrolled in the Savings Plan are eligible for an HSA.) If you have dependent care and medical expenses, you can establish a DCSA and an MSA (or a Limited-use MSA, if you contribute to an HSA.) A retiree who returns to work in an insurance- eligible position under the active group is eligible for the Pretax Group Insurance Premium Feature, a DCSA and an MSA. Health Savings Accounts A Health Savings Account (HSA) is available to employees enrolled in the Savings Plan and can be used to pay health care expenses. The funds do not have to be spent in the year they are deposited. Money in the account accumulates tax free, so the funds can be used to pay qualified medical expenses in the future. An important advantage of an HSA is that you own it. If you leave your job, you can take the account with you and continue to use it for qualified medical expenses.For more information, see the Tax-Favored Accounts Guide on PEBA's insurance benefits website, www.eip.sc.gov.

The IRS does not allow you to pay any insurance premiums through any type of spending account. 2. You cannot transfer money between MoneyPlus accounts or pay a dependent care expense from your Medical Spending Account or vice versa. The dependent care account is for dependent child/adult day care only. It does not provide any medical benefits for your dependents. 3. The IRS gives you until March 15 to spend any remaining funds deposited in your Medical Spending Account or your Limited-use Medical Spending Account from January through December of the previous year. For example: You have until March 15, 2016, to spend funds deposited in your MSA or Limited-use MSA between January 1 and December 31, 2015. However, you must submit all reimbursement requests by March 31, 2016. Any money in your Medical Spending Account or your Limited-use Medical Spending Account after your reimbursable requests have been processed cannot be returned to you or carried over to the next year. 4.

You may not be reimbursed for a service that you have not received. Written certification When enrolling in either or both MoneyPlus spending accounts, you must agree to the following in writing on your enrollment form: I will only use my MoneyPlus account to pay for IRS-qualified expenses eligible under my employer's plan and only for me and my IRS-eligible dependents. I will exhaust all other sources of reimbursement, including those provided under my employer's plan(s), before seeking reimbursement from my MoneyPlus spending account. I will not seek reimbursement through any additional source. I will collect and maintain sufficient documentation to validate the requirements above. Deciding how much to contribute to your Flexible Spending Accounts To estimate how much to deposit in your Dependent Care Spending Account or Medical Spending Account, complete the MoneyPlus Worksheets, which are at www.eip.sc.gov. Be conservative in your estimates. Money remaining in your Dependent Care Spending Account after the plan year ends cannot be returned to you or carried forward to the next plan year. However, you have until March 31, 2017, to submit requests for reimbursement for expenses incurred on or before December 31, 2016. Money remaining in your Medical Spending Account or in your Limited-use Medical Spending Account after the plan year and any grace period ends cannot be returned to you or carried forward to the next plan year. However, you have until March 31, 2017, to submit requests for reimbursement for expenses incurred on or before March 15, 2017, for either of the Medical Spending Accounts.

Dependent Care Spending Account vs. Child and Dependent Care Credit If you pay for the care of a child or another dependent so you can work, you may be able to reduce your taxes by claiming those expenses on your federal income tax return through the Child and Dependent Care Credit. (Depending on a taxpayer's circumstances, participating in a Dependent Care Spending Account on a salary-reduction basis will generally produce the greater tax benefit.) However, it is important to look at your unique circumstances. Go to www.myFBMC.com, and select the Tax Savings Analysis link at the bottom of the home page. Follow the prompts. For more information about the Dependent Care Spending Account, go to the FAQs section on the same website. In addition to the tax benefit of participating in a Dependent Care Spending Account, a partial Child and Dependent Care Credit may be available to you. For example, you may be able to claim an additional tax credit in an amount equal to a percentage of $1,000 if you have: Two or more qualifying individuals A maximum Dependent Care Spending Account tax filing status of $5,000 and $6,000 or more in eligible dependent care expenses. Note: You cannot use the Child and Dependent Care Credit if you are married and filing separately. Dependent care expenses reimbursed through a Dependent Care Spending Account cannot be filed for the credit. In 2016, the Dependent Care Spending Account (DCSA) is capped at $1,500 for highly compensated employees. However, the $1,500 cap is subject to adjustment in mid-year if PEBA's DCSA does not meet the federal Average Benefit Test. The test is designed to make sure highly compensated employees don't receive a benefit that is out of proportion with the benefit received by other employees. For 2016, the Internal Revenue Code defines a highly compensated employee as someone who earned $120,000 or more in calendar year 2015. For assistance, call the Customer Care Center at 800.342.8017. For more information on the Child and Dependent Care Credit, refer to IRS Publication 503. Note: If you participate in the Dependent Care Spending Account or if you file for the Child and Dependent Care Credit, you must attach IRS Form 2441 to your 1040 income tax return. If you do not, the IRS may not allow your pretax exclusion. To claim the income exclusion for dependent care expenses on IRS Form 2441, you must be able to list each dependent care provider's Social Security Number (SSN) or Employer Identification Number (EIN). If you are unable to obtain a dependent care provider's SSN or EIN, you must send with your IRS Form 2441 a written statement that explains the circumstances and states that you made a serious effort to get the information. MoneyPlus Medical Spending Account vs. claiming expenses on IRS Form 1040 Unless your itemized medical and dental expenses exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income*, you cannot claim them on your IRS Form 1040. However, you can save taxes by paying for your uninsured, out-of-pocket medical expenses through a tax-free Medical Spending Account. *Note: If you file a joint tax return, your adjusted gross income includes both your income and your spouse's. With a Medical Spending Account, the money you set aside for medical expenses is deducted from your salary before it is taxed, so you save on taxes. For example, if your adjusted gross income were $45,000, the IRS would only allow you to deduct itemized expenses that exceed $4,500, or 10 percent of your adjusted gross income. But if you have $2,000 in eligible medical expenses, the MoneyPlus account saves you $656 on your medical expenses in federal income tax (15 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016141 MONEYPLUSpercent), South Carolina state tax (7 percent) and Social Security taxes (7.65 percent).

Dependent Care Spending Account Please note: This account is only for paying for day care for children and adults. It may not be used to pay for any medical care for your dependents. You will not be allowed to change this account to a Medical Spending Account after the January 1, 2016, plan year begins. How the Dependent Care Spending Account works 1. Estimate the amount you will spend during the year on dependent care, up to $5,000, depending on your tax status. Don't forget to consider vacation and holiday time when you may not have to pay for dependent care. During the year, make sure you file all your claims for reimbursement. Remember, according to IRS guidelines, any money in your account after you have claimed all your expenses at the end of the year cannot be returned to you or be carried over into the next calendar year. You have until March 31 of the new plan year to file claims for services provided the previous year. 2. The annual amount you contribute to your account will be divided into equal installments and deducted from each paycheck before taxes. It is then credited to your Dependent Care Spending Account. 3. After incurring dependent care expenses, submit a MoneyPlus Claim Form and a copy of your expense documentation from your dependent care provider to WageWorks. The MoneyPlus Claim Form may serve as documentation if it includes the provider's signature. The provider's Tax ID Number or Social Security number is not requested on the claim form. However, you should be prepared to give it to the IRS if asked to do so. 4. Your claim will be processed within five working days of when WageWorks receives it, if it is properly completed and signed, and only if there are enough funds in your account. Then a direct deposit will be issued to your account, or a check will be mailed, up to your current account balance. You will be reimbursed for any remaining expenses when money is available in your account. Note: In 2016, the Dependent Care Spending Account (DCSA) is capped at $1,500 for highly compensated employees. However, the $1,500 cap is subject to adjustment in mid-year if PEBA's DCSA does not meet the federal Average Benefit Test. The test is designed to make sure highly compensated employees don't receive a benefit that is out of proportion with the benefit received by other employees. For 2016, the Internal Revenue Code defines a highly compensated employee as someone who earned $120,000 or more in calendar year 2015. Eligibility You must be eligible for state group insurance benefits to participate in MoneyPlus. However, you are not required to be covered by an insurance program to participate in MoneyPlus, nor do you have to enroll in the Pretax Group Insurance Premium Feature to participate in the Dependent Care or Medical Spending Accounts. EnrollmentMONEYPLUS142 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016You can enroll in the Dependent Care Spending Account within 31 days of your hire date through your benefits administrator. If you do not enroll then, you can enroll during the next enrollment period, October 1-31. You also can enroll in, or make changes to, this account within 31 days of an approved change in status (see \"Special Eligibility Situations,\" Pages 16-23 and \"Changing Your Flexible Spending Account Coverage,\" Pages 151-152). You must re-enroll each year during open enrollment, which occurs yearly in October, to continue your account the next year. The Dependent Care Spending Account allows you to pay dependent care expenses with your pretax income. Here are the limits on how much you may set aside If you are married and filing separately, your maximum is $2,500. If you are single and head of household, your maximum is $5,000. If you are married and filing jointly, your maximum is $5,000. If either you or your spouse earns less than $5,000 a year, your maximum is equal to the lower of the two incomes. If your spouse is a full-time student or incapable of self-care, your maximum is $3,000 a year for one dependent and $5,000 a year for two or more dependents. You may use your Dependent Care Spending Account to receive reimbursement for eligible dependent care expenses for qualified individuals. A qualified individual includes a qualified child if he or she: Is a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national or a resident of the U.S., Mexico or Canada Has a specified family-type relationship to you Lives in your household for more than half of the tax year Is under age 13 Has not provided more than one-half of his own support during the tax year For more information, talk with your benefits administrator or a tax professional, or contact the Internal Revenue Service at 800.829.1040 or www.irs.gov. Eligible expenses Generally, child, adult and elder care costs that allow you and your spouse to work or actively look for work are eligible for reimbursement. If you are married, your spouse must work, be a full-time student or be mentally or physically incapable of self-care. Examples: Day care facility fees Local day camp fees Baby-sitting fees for at-home care while you and your spouse are working (you, your spouse or another tax dependent cannot provide the care) Ineligible expenses Child support payments or child care if you are a non-custodial parent Payments for dependent care services provided by your dependent, your spouse's dependent or your child who is under age 19 Health care costs or educational tuition Overnight care for your dependents (unless it allows you and your spouse to work during that time) Nursing home fees Diaper services Books and suppliesINSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016143 MONEYPLUS Activity fees Kindergarten tuition Reimbursement of eligible DCSA expenses To request reimbursement, you must complete and submit a MoneyPlus Claim Form, along with expense documentation showing the following: The dates your dependent received the care (for example, October 1-October 31), not the date you paid for the service The name and address of the facility The name, address and signature of the individual who provided the dependent care. This information is required with each request for reimbursement. The MoneyPlus Claim Form may serve as documentation if it includes the provider's signature. The provider's Tax ID Number or Social Security number is not requested on the claim form. However, you should be prepared to give it to the IRS if asked to do so. An approved expense will not be reimbursed until after the last date of service for which you are requesting reimbursement. For example, if you pay your dependent care provider on October 1 for the month of October, you can submit your reimbursement request for the entire month. However, payment will not be made until you receive the last day of care for that month. An approved expense will not be reimbursed until enough funds are in your Dependent Care Spending Account to cover the expense. On your claim form, you may divide the dates of service into periods that correspond with your payroll cycle. This will allow you to be reimbursed for part of the amount on the documentation when there are enough funds in your account. Medical Spending Account How the Medical Spending Account Works 1. Estimate the amount you and your family want to set aside in your Medical Spending Account, up to $2,550 for 2016. This amount is indexed and may be updated yearly. If you are married and your spouse is eligible for coverage, you may each set aside up to $2,550. Consider only those expenses you and your family can expect to incur between January 1 and December 31. According to IRS regulations, if you have money left in your MSA on December 31, you have until March 15 of the new year (a grace period) to spend funds deposited in the account during the previous year. You have until March 31 to ask for reimbursement and submit documentation for eligible expenses incurred during the calendar year Although claims are processed in five working days, it may take as long as two weeks to get your check because of time in the mail and weekends. To receive your reimbursement faster, sign up for Direct Deposit. You may also file your DCSA and MSA claims online. To do so, go to www.myFBMC. com. Log in and select \"My Account\" and then \"Online Claim Form.\" For more information, see Page 151.MONEYPLUS144 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016and the grace period. This includes documentation for myFBMC Card\u00ae transactions. Check www.myFBMC.com for any outstanding transactions that may need documentation. Between January 1 and March 15, any myFBMC Card\u00ae swipes or paper claims filed will be paid from funds remaining in your MSA from the previous year. For example, if you have 2015 MSA funds you would like to use, submit all of your 2015 claims before you begin turning in claims for 2016 expenses. Once your 2015 funds are exhausted, you will begin to be reimbursed from your 2016 account. Remember, any money in your account after you have claimed all of your expenses cannot be returned to you or carried over beyond March 15 of the new year. If you had a myFBMC Card\u00ae during the old plan year, you can continue to use it to pay eligible expenses from your previous year's MSA until March 15. If you have not signed up for an MSA again, you cannot use your myFBMC Card\u00ae after December 31. However, you may submit paper claims until March 31 for expenses incurred until March 15 of the new plan year. 2. The yearly amount you elect to contribute to your account will be divided into equal installments and deducted from each paycheck before taxes. It is then credited to your Medical Spending Account. 3. After incurring medical or dental expenses, submit a MoneyPlus Claim Form and a copy of the expense documentation or the Explanation of Benefits for these expenses to WageWorks. File the claim only for your unreimbursed expenses. Approved claims will be paid until you have reached the annual amount you chose to have deducted. It will take five working days to process your claim after WageWorks receives it. Then a direct deposit will be issued to your account within 48 hours after your approved claim is processed, or a check will be mailed. Because of weekends and time in the mail, it may take up to two weeks for you to receive your check. 4. You may present your myFBMC Card\u00ae when you incur eligible medical expenses, including prescriptions or dental expenses. If the provider accepts the card, the funds will be automatically withdrawn from your account, and you will not have to wait for reimbursement. Instructions on when to submit expense documentation will be provided on your monthly statement, or you may check www.myFBMC.com. Eligibility You must be eligible for active group insurance to participate in MoneyPlus. However, you are not required to be enrolled in an insurance program to participate in MoneyPlus, nor do you have to enroll in the Pretax Group Insurance Premium Feature to participate in a Dependent Care or Medical Spending account. Enrollment To continue your Medical Spending Account each year, you must re-enroll during the enrollment period, October 1-31. If you have a myFBMC Card\u00ae, you must also re-enroll for it each year. You can enroll in, or make changes to, your MSA within 31 days of an approved change in status (see \"Special Eligibility INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016145 MONEYPLUSSituations,\" Pages 16-23 and \"Changing Your Flexible Spending Account Coverage,\" Pages 151-152). You may enroll or re-enroll online at www. myFBMC.com during October enrollment. You also may complete a MoneyPlus Enrollment Form, available from your benefits administrator or on the PEBA insurance benefits website at www.eip.sc.gov. Submit the completed form to your benefits administrator. You may set aside up to $2,550 annually to pay your medical, vision and dental expenses that are not reimbursed by insurance. This figure may be adjusted yearly for inflation. Your MoneyPlus MSA may be used to reimburse eligible expenses incurred by: Yourself Your spouse (even if he has a Medical Spending Account) Your qualifying child Your qualifying relative An individual is a qualifying child if he is not someone else's qualifying child, and: Does not reach age 27 during the taxable year Has a specified family-type relationship to you: son/daughter, stepson/stepdaughter, eligible foster child, legally adopted child, or child placed for legal adoption Is a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national or a resident of the U.S., Mexico or Canada An individual is a qualifying relative if he is a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national or a resident of the U.S., Mexico or Canada and: Has a specified family-type relationship to you, is not someone else's qualifying child and receives more than one half of his support from you during the tax year or If no specified family-type relationship to you exists, is a member of and lives in your household (without violating local law) for the entire tax year and receives more than one-half of his support from you during the tax year. Note: There is no age requirement for a qualifying child if he is physically and/or mentally incapable of self-care. An eligible child of divorced parents is treated as a dependent of both, so either or both parents can establish a MoneyPlus MSA. For more information, contact your benefits administrator or tax advisor or the Internal Revenue Service at 800.829.1040 or at www.irs.gov. Eligible expenses \u2014Medical Spending Account Expenses eligible for reimbursement include your deductibles, coinsurance and copayments. In addition to these expenses, your MSA is an excellent way to help pay for: Annual physical exams Vision care Out-of-pocket dental fees (including orthodontia, if medically necessary, but not if cosmetic) Over-the-counter drugs, but only if prescribed by a physician Non-medicinal over-the-counter items, including diabetic supplies, are still reimbursable without a prescription Any other out-of-pocket medical expenses deductible under current tax laws, including travel to and from medical facilities. Note: Orthodontia treatment designed to treat a specific medical condition can be reimbursed. However, you will have to submit additional documentation each year.

Eligible expenses \u2014 Limited-use Medical Spending Account If you have a Health Savings Account (HSA), you are eligible for a Limited-use Medical Spending Account. This account may be used to pay expenses not covered by the Savings Plan, such as dental and vision care. You may use your HSA, but not your Limited-use MSA, for deductibles and coinsurance. Over-the-counter medicineUnder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, an MSA can only be used to pay for over-the-counter drugs if those drugs are prescribed by a physician. A list of categories of over-the-counter items that the IRS has approved for reimbursement is available at www.myFBMC.com. Ineligible expenses Insurance premiums Vision warranties and service contracts Health or fitness club membership fees Cosmetic surgery not deemed medically necessary to alleviate, mitigate or prevent a medical condition. Availability Once you sign up for an MSA and decide how much to contribute, the entire amount will be available on January 1. You do not have to wait for the funds to accumulate in your account before being reimbursed for eligible medical expenses. Medical Spending Account reimbursement If you use a myFBMC Card\u00ae, funds will be transferred automatically from your MSA. You will not need to wait for reimbursement. The myFBMC Card\u00ae is discussed in detail below. If you file by mail, your reimbursement will be issued within five business days from the time your properly completed and signed claim form is received. However, weekends and time in the mail may mean it will take longer to receive your check. The minimum reimbursement is $5, except for the last reimbursement, which brings your account balance to zero. Direct Deposit Your MoneyPlus reimbursement checks can be deposited automatically into your checking or savings account. There is no extra fee for this service, and you will still be notified that your claim has been processed. To apply, complete a MoneyPlus Direct Deposit Authorization Form available from your benefits office or on PEBA's insurance benefits website at www.eip.sc.gov. Processing your direct deposit application may take four to six weeks. MoneyPlus spending accounts are tax-favored accounts and must follow the guidelines under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code.

MyFBMC Card\u00ae Visa\u00ae Card Beginning in 2016, the myFBMC Card\u00ae is issued at no charge to all MoneyPlus MSA and Limited-use MSA participants. You may use the debit card to use funds from your MSA or Limited-use MSA to pay eligible, uninsured medical expenses for yourself and for your covered family members. There is no risk of overspending. If you try to spend more than you will deposit into the account during the year, the transaction will be denied.

Please remember to keep documentation of your expenses, as stated in the IRS regulations. The card will only be accepted at IIAS merchants. An up-to-date list of stores meeting the federal electronic coding requirements is at www.myFBMC.com. After you log in, click on the \"My Account\" tab at the top of the page and then select \"My Account FAQ's.\" After that, select \"Payment Card.\" Under that category, click on \"What is IIAS?\" On the website, you will also find a list of categories of over-the-counter items that the IRS has approved for reimbursement. The pharmacy must also participate in your health plan's network. A list of pharmacies that are part of your network is on the PEBA insurance benefits website under \"Online Directories.\" If you use a pharmacy that is not part of your plan's network, you will pay the full cost for the drug. The cost will not apply to your deductible. When using your myFBMC Card\u00ae at a pharmacy, just swipe the card as you would any credit or debit card. A PIN is not needed. Your receipt will show the name of the drug and the amount of the copayment that was taken from your MSA. If a provider does not accept the card, you must use a MoneyPlus Claim Form to file for reimbursement. The form is available on the PEBA insurance benefits website at www.eip.sc.gov. Up to five prescriptions with fixed copayments (such as $9, $38 and $63 under the Standard Plan) on one card transaction will be auto-adjudicated. Auto-adjudicated means they will be verified and approved when you make the purchase without requiring documentation later. If you have more than five prescriptions on one card transaction, all of the prescriptions will require documentation. Documentation will be required when you use the card for any transaction that does not have a fixed copayment. If prescription drugs are purchased through your health plan's mail-order pharmacy, documentation will not be required for any prescriptions and IRS-approved over-the-counter items. Documenting myFBMC Card\u00ae transactions According to the IRS, it is not necessary to submit documentation for: Up to five prescriptions with fixed copayments on one card transaction. (These prescriptions will be auto-adjudicated, verified and approved when you make the purchase On Pages 143- 144 you will find information about how the run-out period and grace period apply to the myFBMC Card\u00ae.If you are enrolled in the Standard Plan, you may use your myFBMC Card\u00ae for mail- order prescriptions. No documentation is required for prescriptions with known copayments.INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016149 MONEYPLUSwithout requiring documentation later.) Known copayments for services provided through the State Health Plan Eligible prescriptions purchased through your health plan's mail-order pharmacy IRS-approved over-the-counter items. However, documentation is needed for other health care expenses. When you receive your quarterly statement, transactions requiring documentation will be highlighted in blue. If an expense appears in this section you must fax a copy of your documentation and a MoneyPlus Claim Form to WageWorks. No cover sheet is needed. Documentation can be an Explanation of Benefits from your health plan or a statement or bill showing the name of the patient, the date of service, the type of service, the service provider and the cost of service. If the documentation is for a drug, be sure it includes the prescription number and the name of the drug. Most drug store receipts do not show the name of the drug. You may need to submit a print-out that includes the name of the drug. It may be from the pharmacy, from your prescription drug program's website or from the pharmacy's website. The name also may be on a note stapled to the bag from the pharmacy. The claim form is available on the PEBA insurance benefits website at www.eip.sc.gov under \"Forms.\" You may also get a copy from www.myFBMC.com, or from your benefits administrator. The claim form is necessary to process the documentation. When an outstanding myFBMC Card\u00ae transaction has appeared in blue on two quarterly statements, the next time you submit an approved paper claim, enough money will be kept in your account to make up for the card transaction that you have not documented. You will be reimbursed for the difference between the new claim and the undocumented claim. This is called \"automatic substitution.\" You may also satisfy any outstanding myFBMC Card\u00ae transactions by submitting a check to WageWorks, made out to your employer in the amount of the outstanding transaction. Please submit documentation for items listed in blue on your quarterly statement. If you do not send in documentation after a transaction has appeared in blue on two quarterly statements, your card will be suspended on the last working day of the month. If an undocumented transaction appears in blue on more than two consecutive quarterly statements and no automatic substitution has occurred, your myFBMC Card\u00ae will be suspended until: Your documentation is received and/or Automatic substitution occurs and/or You repay your account by check. When the transaction in question is cleared by one of these methods, your card will be automatically reinstated. Any amounts from January 1, 2015, to March 15, 2016, that are not cleared by March 31, 2016, violate IRS guidelines and will be taxed as income. You should keep all documents substantiating your claims for at least one year and submit them upon request. Lost cards If your myFBMC Card\u00ae is lost or stolen, call 888.462.1909 immediately. Limited-use Medical Spending MONEYPLUS150 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016Account Savings Plan subscribers who contribute to an HSA also may be eligible to enroll in a Limited-use Medical Spending Account (MSA) to pay dental and vision care expenses, as these are not covered by the Savings Plan. Except for the restrictions regarding which expenses are reimbursable, a MoneyPlus Limited-use MSA works the same as a MoneyPlus MSA. Using your Limited-use MSA Since you can pay your out-of-pocket medical expenses with your MoneyPlus HSA, some MoneyPlus MSA features are not available with a MoneyPlus Limited-use MSA, including: No reimbursement of out-of-pocket medical expenses, such as deductibles and coinsurance. No reimbursement for over-the-counter items. Remember, MoneyPlus Limited-use MSAs are available only to HSA participants.

MoneyPlus program and IRS regulations establish which \"changes in status\" allow you to change contributions to your account. The change you wish to make to your Dependent Care Spending Account (DCSA) or Medical Spending Account (MSA) must be consistent with the event that initiates the change. For example, you may wish to start a DCSA if you have a baby or adopt a child. You may want to decrease your MSA contribution if you get a divorce and will no longer be paying for your ex-spouse's out-of-pocket medical expenses. Within 31 days of one of the events listed below, you must complete and submit a Change in Status Form to your benefits Employees can enroll or reenroll in an MSA or a DCSA online during open enrollment, which occurs yearly in October. If you wish to open an HSA, which is associated with the Savings Plan, you must do so online.MONEYPLUS152 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016administrator if you wish to make changes in your account. The form is available on the PEBA insurance benefits website at www.eip.sc.gov and from your benefits administrator. Your benefits administrator must complete and review the form, along with any necessary documentation, authorize it and forward the form in a timely manner. Any related claims you submit in the interim will be held until WageWorks receives and processes the Change in Status Form. Birth, adoption and placement for adoption are effective on the date of the event. All other changes in status are effective the first of the month after the date of the request. Some changes in status that permit changes to your account are: Marriage, divorce Birth, placement for adoption, adoption Placement for custody Dependent loses eligibility Death of spouse or child Gain or loss of employment Begin or end unpaid leave of absence Change from full-time to part-time employment or vice versa Change in day-care provider. You cannot change your MoneyPlus account because you are in the process of a divorce. When a divorce is final, it is a change-in-status event that does permit you to change your MoneyPlus account. For more information, contact your benefits administrator or call the WageWorks Customer Care Center at 800.342.8017. How changes affect your period of coverageYour MoneyPlus spending account is set up for the entire calendar year (your period of coverage). However, if you are permitted to change it during the year (an approved, mid-plan-year election change), you have more than one period of coverage. Money you deposit during the original period of coverage may be combined with money you deposit after the mid-year change. However, expenses you incurred before the mid-year change cannot be reimbursed for more money than was in the MoneyPlus account before the change. How leaving your job affects your Flexible Spending Account Medical Spending Account COBRA coverage under a MoneyPlus MSA will be offered only if you have an under-spent account. An account is under spent if the amount you elected to contribute to your account for the plan year, minus any reimbursable claims you have submitted up to the date of the COBRA qualifying event, is equal to or more than the amount you would have contributed to the account had you remained employed for the remainder of the plan year. COBRA coverage will consist of the amount you have in your MSA at the time of the qualifying event, plus additional contributions up to the annual amount you elected to contribute. You will be charged a 2 percent administrative fee. The use-it-or-lose-it rule will continue to apply. You will lose any funds remaining in your account at the end of the grace period, and COBRA coverage will end. WageWorks, the third-party If you leave your job, your myFBMC Card\u00ae will be canceled.INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016153 MONEYPLUSclaims processor, will contact you regarding continuation of coverage. If you do not continue your MSA as permitted under COBRA, you have 90 days from your last day worked to submit eligible MSA expenses incurred before you left employment. Any funds still in your account will not be returned to you. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) may affect your rights to continue coverage while on leave. Please contact your employer for further information. Dependent Care Spending Account If you leave your job permanently or take an unpaid leave of absence, you cannot continue contributing to your Dependent Care Spending Account. You can, however, request reimbursement for eligible expenses incurred while you were employed, until you exhaust your account or the plan year ends. Health Savings Account Subscribers enrolled in the State Health Plan Savings Plan can save money for qualified medical expenses tax free through a Health Savings Account (HSA). Eligibility To be eligible for the state's HSA, a subscriber must be covered by the Savings Plan, which is a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). He cannot be covered by any other health plan that is not a HDHP, including Medicare. However, he can be covered for specific injuries, accidents, disability, dental care, vision care and long-term care. He cannot be claimed as a dependent on another person's income tax return. An eligible subscriber may establish an HSA offered through any qualified financial institution. However, to contribute to an HSA on a pretax basis through payroll deduction, he must enroll in the MoneyPlus HSA. Wells Fargo is the custodian for these accounts. The accounts are administered by WageWorks. Retirees please note a retiree who is not enrolled in Medicare may be covered by the Savings Plan and contribute to an HSA. If you are retired and eligible for and enrolled in Medicare, you may not contribute to an HSA. Enrolling in an HSA When you have met the eligibility requirements for an HSA, complete a MoneyPlus enrollment form choosing the HSA option. Give the form to your benefits administrator. If you would like to open an HSA with Wells Fargo go to the PEBA insurance benefits website, www.eip.sc.gov, and click on \"Links.\" Under \"MoneyPlus,\" select \"Open HSA Bank Account with Wells Fargo.\" You will need to know your Employer HSA ID number (002470000000000) (00247 followed by 10 A MoneyPlus MSA, even a spouse's MSA, is considered other health insurance under HSA regulations. However, if you have no funds in your MSA on December 31, you may begin contributing to an HSA on January 1. If you have a Limited-use MSA, you may begin making HSA contributions on January 1. A Limited-use MSA may only be used for dental and vision expenses, so it is not other health insurance.MONEYPLUS154 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016zeroes), your type of coverage (single or family) and your Social Security number. If you don't have Internet access and want to open a MoneyPlus HSA, check with your benefits administrator. Once you enroll in an HSA, you do not have to re-enroll in it as long as you remain eligible for it. Active subscribers enrolled in the Savings Plan, upon turning 65, remain eligible to contribute to an HSA, if they delay enrollment in Medicare Part A by delaying receiving Social Security. (A person can delay enrolling in Social Security until age 70\u00bd.) Once this subscriber enrolls in Social Security (Part A of Medicare), usually at retirement, he can no longer make contributions to an HSA, including catch-up contributions. However, the funds already in the HSA can be withdrawn to pay Medicare premiums (not Medigap premiums), deductibles and coinsurance, which are qualified expenses. Retirees enrolled in the Savings Plan are eligible to contribute to an HSA (although not through MoneyPlus). They may enroll in the HSA at Wells Fargo, or any other institution that offers an HSA, and make catch-up contributions. The retiree may claim his HSA contribution on his income tax return. Limited-use Medical Spending Account If you have an HSA, you also may be eligible for a Limited-use MSA. That account may be used for expenses not covered by your health insurance, the Savings Plan. Eligible expenses include dental and vision care. See page 159 for more information. If you enrolled in a full MSA instead of an HSA, you cannot sign up for an HSA until the next enrollment period or until a special eligibility situation occurs that allows you to end your MSA within 31 days of the event. Contributions The maximum contribution to an HSA is indexed for inflation. In 2016, a subscriber with single coverage can contribute $3,350, and a subscriber who covers himself and any other family member can contribute $6,750. Total contributions for the entire year may not exceed these limits. For example, a subscriber with single coverage under the Savings Plan can contribute $3,350 to his HSA for the 12 months beginning January 1, 2016. Contributions may be paid in a lump sum, in equal amounts for 12 months (such as through payroll deduction with MoneyPlus) or in any combination of payments during the year, as long as the total does not exceed $3,350. A subscriber with the same coverage who enrolls by December 1, 2016, may also contribute $3,350. However, he must remain eligible for a full 12 months after the end of the plan year. Contributions may be paid in a lump sum, in equal amounts during the months he is eligible (such as through payroll deduction with MoneyPlus) or in any combination of payments during the year, as long as the total does not exceed $3,350. A subscriber who had funds in an MSA on December 31, 2015, may not The Employer HSA ID number for an account at Wells Fargo is 002470000000000.INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016155 MONEYPLUSbegin contributing to an HSA until the day after the end of the MSA run-out period, April 1, 2016. However, his maximum contribution would still be $3,350. Contributions may be paid in a lump sum, in equal amounts for nine months (such as through payroll deduction with MoneyPlus) or in any combination of payments during the year, as long as the total does not exceed $3,350. He must remain eligible for 12 months after the end of the plan year. A subscriber who had no funds in his MSA on December 31, 2015, may make the maximum contribution to his HSA in 2015 and may begin contributing on January 1, 2016. Contributions may be paid in a lump sum, in equal amounts for 12 months (such as through payroll deduction with MoneyPlus) or in any combination of payments during the year, as long as the total does not exceed $3,350. Subscribers age 55 and older may make additional \"catch-up\" contributions to an HSA. The amount for 2016 is $1,000. There is no minimum contribution, but remember that administrative fees will be deducted from your account. HSAs established at Wells Fargo through MoneyPlus include a WageWorks fee of $1.50 per month. You also pay a bank fee of $1.75 per month, until your account exceeds $2,500. The HSA Custodial Account disclosure statement and funds availability disclosure agreement is available at www.eip.sc.gov, or by contacting WageWorks Customer Care at 800.342.8017 or www.myFBMC.com. For information about a Wells Fargo HSA go to www.wellsfargo.com or call 866.884.7374.General HSA information is available from the U.S. Dept. of the Treasury at www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Taxes/Pages/Health-Savings-Accounts.aspx. Changing contributions Unlike an MSA, you may enroll, change or stop your contributions to your MoneyPlus HSA through payroll deduction once a month. To make the change, fill out a new MoneyPlus Enrollment Form and complete Box A. You may make regular and catch-up contributions to your HSA up to the time your federal income tax return is due, usually April 15. Contributions over federal limits WageWorks will monitor your HSA contributions and send an alert to your benefits administrator if you are exceeding your contribution limit. However, the best way to avoid problems is to divide your annual contribution among the number of paychecks you receive. For example, if you have single coverage, you can deduct a maximum of $3,350 for 2016. If you receive 24 paychecks each year, you can deduct $139.58 (rounded down) each pay period. If you have family coverage, you can deduct a maximum of $6,750 for 2016. If you receive 24 paychecks a year, you can deduct $281.25 each pay period. Using HSA funds After you enroll in an HSA, you will receive a Visa\u00ae debit card from Wells Fargo. You may order additional cards by calling Wells Fargo at 866.884.7374 or by logging into your account at www.wellsfargo.com. You should receive the card within 10 business days. You can also order a supply of checks by calling this MONEYPLUS156 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016number. You may use the card or the checks to reimburse yourself from your HSA. Using a check without sufficient funds in your account will result in additional fees. One important difference between an HSA and an MSA is that on January 1, after open enrollment, which occurs yearly in October, you have immediate access to your full yearly contribution to an MSA. This is not true of an HSA. You can only withdraw HSA funds that are actually in your account. If you use your debit card for a transaction and you do not have enough money in your account, the transaction will not go through or you will be charged an overdraft fee. If you write a check and you do not have enough money in your account, you will be charged for writing a check with insufficient funds. Availability of funds Each contribution to your MoneyPlus HSA will be available after your employer's payroll is received and processed by WageWorks, transferred to Wells Fargo and deposited in your account. Deposits are sent to Wells Fargo twice a week. Funds should generally be available in your HSA no later than a week after your pay date. Remember, this depends on when your employer submits the deductions and payroll reports. You will receive monthly statements from Wells Fargo. You may also check your balance by visiting any Wells Fargo banking location. Through the online Wells Fargo Health Account Manager, you can check your balance, make online contributions, review monthly statements and annual tax reporting, transfer funds, set up your HSA investment account and more. After your account is open, go to wellsfargo.com and sign up for online access. Please note: If you are already registered with another Wells Fargo account, your user name and password will stay the same. You will see your HSA listed next to your other Wells Fargo accounts. There is no charge for these services.You can make deposits to, or withdrawals from, your account at any Wells Fargo banking location. You may also use your Wells Fargo Visa\u00ae HSA debit card at a Wells Fargo ATM to reimburse yourself for out-of-pocket expenses. Any withdrawals must be for medical expenses that qualify under IRS guidelines. If they do not qualify, they may be subject to taxes and penalties. Eligible expenses You may use the funds in your HSA, tax free, to pay for unreimbursed eligible medical expenses for yourself, your spouse and your tax dependents. Medical expenses include the costs of diagnosis, cure, treatment or prevention of physical or mental defects or illnesses, including dental and vision expenses. HSA funds can only be used tax-free to HSA administrative fees per month Health Savings Account (WageWorks fee)1 $1.50 Health Savings Account (Wells Fargo fee)2, 3 $1.75 1This fee is deducted from your paycheck. 2This fee, for HSAs established with Wells Fargo Bank, is deducted from your account. The fee is waived for accounts with balances of $2,500 or more. 3There is no fee for processing checks. There is a $15 one- time fee for a basic order of checks. There is no charge if you use your Visa\u00ae debit card. There may be additional fees, such as those for insufficient funds. All fees are deducted from your HSA. The $1.75 monthly service charge continues, even when your HSA balance reaches $0. As a result, your account will be overdrawn, and you will be subject to additional charges.INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016157 MONEYPLUSpay for over-the-counter drugs if the drugs were prescribed by a physician. For more information, contact the IRS. Documentation of eligible expenses You should keep receipts for expenses paid from your HSA with your tax returns in case the IRS audits your tax return and requests copies. If you use HSA funds for ineligible expenses, you will be subject to taxes on the amount you took from your HSA, as well as a 20-percent penalty if you are younger than age 65. HSA fees If you deposit funds to your HSA through payroll deduction, administrative fees will be deducted. There are no transaction fees for investing in mutual fund options. If you will not contribute to your MoneyPlus HSA during the year but want to keep your account with Wells Fargo open, you must continue to pay the $1.75 monthly fee, until you have a minimum balance of $2,500. There is no WageWorks fee if you are not actively contributing. Investment of HSA funds One of the advantages of an HSA is that you do not have to spend all the funds during the year in which they are deposited, as you do with a MSA. The funds can accumulate and can be used for eligible medical expenses in the future. Your funds will initially be held in an interest- bearing checking account with Wells Fargo. As the account grows, you may be eligible to place your funds over $2,000 into the Wells Fargo Advantage Funds options.Unlike funds in an interest-bearing checking account, money invested in a mutual fund is not FDIC-insured. You have the opportunity to earn a higher rate of return on your investment, but that is not guaranteed. There is a possibility you will lose money, including the original amount invested. Portability (Continuing your coverage) If you leave your job, you can take your HSA with you and continue to use it for qualified medical expenses. Tax reporting After year end, Wells Fargo will send you tax filing information to use in reporting your HSA contributions and withdrawals when you file your taxes. It is important to save documentation, including receipts, invoices and explanations of benefits from your health insurance carrier, in case you are asked to show the IRS proof that your HSA funds were used for qualified expenses. If you participate in MoneyPlus, pretax HSA contributions will appear on your W-2 Form as employer-paid contributions. This is because this money was deducted from your salary before it was taxed. Do not deduct this money on your return. Only after-tax contributions may be deducted. Consult your tax advisor for more information. If you have questions about how your HSA contributions were reported on your W-2 Form, contact your benefits office. Closing your HSA If you are no longer eligible to contribute to an HSA, or no longer wish to do so, you must go to your benefits administrator and complete MONEYPLUS158 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016a MoneyPlus Enrollment Form. Enter \"$0\" in Section A to stop contributions to the account. You and your benefits administrator must sign the form before your benefits administrator submits it. If money remains in the account, you may continue to use it for qualified, unreimbursed medical expenses. To close the account, contact the Wells Fargo HSA Account Holder customer service line at 866.884.7374. How death affects your MoneyPlus accounts Flexible Spending Accounts Medical Spending Accounts (MSA) and Dependent Care Spending Accounts (DCSA) end on the date the employee dies. They are not refunded to the survivor. An IRS-qualified dependent/beneficiary may continue an MSA through the end of the plan year under COBRA. Contact WageWorks or your benefits administrator for more information. If the MSA is not continued through COBRA, the beneficiary has 90 days from the date of death to submit claims for eligible expenses incurred through the date of death. DCSA claims incurred through the date of death may be submitted until the account is exhausted or through the end of the year. The death of a spouse or child creates a \"change in status\" that makes it possible to stop, start or vary the amount contributed to an MSA or DCSA. You have 31 days from the date of death to make the change. See Page 152 for information about changing your contribution. Health Savings AccountsIf the beneficiary of the Health Savings Account (HSA) is the account owner's spouse, the HSA can be transferred to an HSA in the spouse's name. If the beneficiary is not the spouse, the account will cease to be an HSA on the date of death. If the beneficiary is the account owner's estate, the fair market value of the account on the date of death will be taxable on the account owner's final return. For beneficiaries other than the spouse or the estate, the fair market value of the account is taxable to the beneficiary for the tax year in which the account owner died. For more information, see Section VII of the Health Savings Account Custodial Agreement. A copy of the agreement is on the PEBA insurance benefits website, www.eip.sc.gov. To settle the account, contact the bank that is the custodian of the account. Appeals If your request for reimbursement, claim for benefits or mid-plan-year election change is denied, in full or in part, you have the right to appeal the decision by sending a written request within 30 days of the denial for review to WageWorks (Attn: Appeals Process), P.O. Box 14766, Lexington, KY 40512-4766). Please retain copies of claims and receipts for your records.

Your appeal will be reviewed when it and its supporting documentation are received. You will be notified of the results of this review within 30 business days from receipt of your appeal. In unusual cases, such as when an appeal requires additional documentation, the review may take longer than 30 business days. If your appeal is approved, additional processing time is required to modify your benefit elections.If you are still dissatisfied after the decision is re-examined, you may ask PEBA Insurance Benefits to review the matter by making a written request to PEBA Insurance Benefits within 90 days of notice of the denial. If the denial is upheld by the PEBA Insurance Benefits Appeals Committee, you have 30 days to seek judicial review as provided by Sections 1-11-710 and 1-23-380 of the S.C. Code of Laws, as amended. Note: Appeals are approved only if the extenuating circumstances and supporting documentation are within your employer's, your insurance provider's and IRS' regulations governing the plan.

For insurance purposes, members of a defined benefit plan administered by PEBA must meet the minimum retirement eligibility requirements established by the system in which they participate when they leave covered employment. Defined benefit plans administered by PEBA include the South Carolina Retirement System (SCRS), Police Officers Retirement System (PORS), General Assembly Retirement System (GARS) and Judges and Solicitors Retirement System (JSRS). Employees who started work before July 1, 2012 SCRS members must have at least five years of earned service credit and be eligible to retire due to age (60) or years of service (28 years) or be approved for SCRS disability retirement. SCRS members are also eligible to retire at age 55 with at least 25 years of service. PORS members must have at least five years of earned service credit and be eligible to retire due to age (55) or years of service (25 years) or be approved for PORS disability retirement.

Employees who participate in the State Optional Retirement Program There is no minimum age or years of service requirement for State Optional Retirement Program (State ORP) participants. They become eligible to receive distributions when they leave employment or reach age 59 \u00bd. However, eligibility for retiree group insurance is not the same as eligibility for retirement. To be eligible for retiree group insurance, State ORP participants must: Have 28 years of service with a state insurance participating employer or Have five years of service with a state insurance participating employer and have reached age 60. The employer must verify time worked as a State ORP participant.Disability retirement You may be eligible for retiree group insurance if you have been approved for disability retirement benefits through one of the defined benefit plans administered by PEBA Retirement Benefits: South Carolina Retirement System (SCRS), Police Officers Retirement System (PORS), General Assembly Retirement System (GARS) or Judges and Solicitors Retirement System (JSRS).

However, a State ORP participant may meet the retirement eligibility requirement for retiree group insurance through approval by the Standard Insurance Company for Basic Long Term Disability and/or Supplemental Long Term Disability. Employees of local subdivisions that do not participate with PEBA's retirement benefits may meet the disability retirement eligibility requirement for retiree group insurance through approval by the Standard Insurance Company for Basic Long Term Disability and/or Supplemental Long Term Disability. Eligibility for disability retirement South Carolina Retirement System (SCRS) members Disability retirement eligibility for SCRS members is based on entitlement to Social Security disability benefits. The member must have at least five years of earned service credit if he was hired before July 1, 2012, and at least eight years of earned service credit if he was hired on or after July 1, 2012, unless the disability is the result of an on-the-job injury.RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY164 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016Applications must be filed while the member is still \"in service,\" even if he has not been approved for Social Security disability. A member is considered in service on the date the application is received by PEBA if: 1. The last day the member was employed by a covered employer was no more than 90 days before the date PEBA received the application; and 2. The member had not been retired on a service retirement allowance for more than 90 days at the time PEBA received the application. A member must provide a copy of the Social Security Award Letter to PEBA Retirement Benefits. The benefit will be effective on the date the Social Security Administration (SSA) determines the disability began or the day after the member's termination date, whichever is later. A member will not be eligible for SCRS disability benefits if the date the SSA determines the disability began is more than one year after the member's termination date. Police Officers Retirement System (PORS) members To be eligible for PORS disability retirement benefits, the member must have at least five years of earned service credit if he was hired before July 1, 2012, and at least eight years of earned service credit if he was hired on or after July 1, 2012, unless the disability is the result of an on-the-job injury. The member must be permanently incapacitated from performing job duties. PORS disability retirement claims are evaluated by a disability determination provider and a medical board.Insurance coverage for disability retirees If you are approved for disability before you leave employment, you may apply for insurance coverage as a retiree within 31 days of notification by PEBA Retirement Benefits. State ORP participants and employees of local subdivisions that do not participate with PEBA Retirement Benefits may meet the disability retirement eligibility requirement for retiree group insurance through approval by Standard Insurance Company for Basic Long Term Disability and/or Supplemental Long Term Disability. Your coverage as a retiree will be effective the first of the month after you leave active employment. If you leave employment before your application for disability is approved, you may enroll in continued coverage under COBRA for health, dental and vision benefits. Another option for health insurance is to enroll in coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. If your disability application is later approved by PEBA Insurance Benefits, you may apply for coverage as a retiree within 31 days of notification. You may choose that your insurance coverage as a retiree be effective the first of the month after the date of notification or the first of the month after your date of retirement. You will be responsible for payment of all retroactive premiums. How TERI participation affects retiree insurance If you are a Teacher and Employee Retention Incentive (TERI) program participant in a permanent, full-time position, your insurance benefits as an active employee continue. When your TERI participation ends, you must INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016165 RETIREMENT AND DISABILITYapply for continuation of your insurance as a retiree (if eligible) within 31 days of your date of termination. Your service as a TERI participant in a full-time, permanent position with a participating employer may be applied toward retiree insurance eligibility. Will your employer pay part of your premiums? As an active employee, your employer must pay part of the cost of your health and dental insurance. When you retire, the amount your employer contributes to your retiree insurance premiums is based on several factors, including the type of agency from which you retired. State agency, higher education and public school district retirees You may be eligible for a state contribution to your retiree insurance premiums based on when you began employment and on your number of years of earned service credit with an employer that participates in the state insurance program. Local subdivision retirees Retiree insurance eligibility guidelines are the same for local subdivision retirees as they are for state, higher education and public school district retirees. However, the funding may be different. Local subdivisions may or may not pay a portion of the cost of their retirees' insurance premiums. Each local subdivision develops its own policy for funding retiree insurance premiums for its eligible retirees. If you are a local subdivision employee, contact your benefits office for information about retiree insurance premiums. Employees hired before May 2, 2008If you worked in an insurance-eligible position before May 2, 2008, with an employer participating in the state insurance program, your health insurance premiums are based on the number of years of earned service with an employer participating in the state insurance program. For insurance eligibility purposes, earned service credit is time earned and established with one of the plans administered by PEBA Retirement Benefits [South Carolina Retirement System (SCRS), Police Officers Retirement System (PORS), General Assembly Retirement System (GARS) or Judges and Solicitors Retirement System (JSRS)]. Insurance eligibility can also be earned through time worked while participating in the State Optional Retirement Program (State ORP) or time worked with a local subdivision that participates in PEBA Insurance Benefits but not with PEBA Retirement Benefits. This includes time that you worked for an employer that participates in the state insurance program, even if you did not participate in any coverage offered through the program. Periods of non-qualified service, federal service, military service and out-of-state service purchased in the retirement systems, as well as sick leave and service with employers that do not participate in the state insurance program, do not count toward earned service with PEBA Insurance Benefits. State ORP participants cannot purchase time to meet eligibility. Service as a TERI participant in a full-time, permanent position with a participating employer may be applied toward earned service credit to determine retiree insurance eligibility. Retirees hired before May 2, 2008, may be funded or non-funded. A funded retiree's former employer contributes to his retiree RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY166 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016insurance premiums. A non-funded retiree receives no contribution. He is responsible for the entire cost. Funded retirees (Employer pays its part of the premium) To be eligible for funded retiree insurance, you must be eligible to retire and meet one of these criteria: You left employment when you were eligible to retire and you have at least 10 years of state-covered entity service credit with an employer that participates in the state insurance program. The last five years of earned service credit must have been served consecutively in a full-time, permanent position with a state agency, a higher education institution or a public school district. You may enroll within 31 days of your retirement or of a special eligibility situation, or during open enrollment. You left employment before you were eligible to retire but when you left, you had at least 20 years of earned service credit with an employer that participates in the state insurance program. The last five years must have been served consecutively in a full-time, permanent position with a state agency, a higher education institution or a public school district. If you are an SCRS member and you kept your contributions in your SCRS account, you may enroll within 31 days of your 60th birthday (when you become eligible to apply for a deferred retirement annuity*) or of a special eligibility situation, or during open enrollment. *If you left employment before age 60, you may apply for a service retirement benefit when you turn age 60.

This rule applies only to SCRS members. You may enroll within 31 days of your retirement or of a special eligibility situation, or during open enrollment. If you do not enroll in health insurance when you retire under the 55/25 rule, you may enroll within 31 days of the date you turn age 60 or would have had 28 years of service credit, whichever occurs first. However, it is your responsibility to keep up with when you become eligible for funded rates and to notify your benefits administrator.

You are a former municipal or county council member who served on council for at least 12 years and were covered under the state's insurance program when you left the council. It is up to the county or municipal council to decide whether to allow former members to have this coverage. However, you are required to pay the full, non-funded premium.

At retirement, you must meet established insurance eligibility rules. Funding RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY168 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016for your health insurance will be determined by calculating the number of years of earned service with an employer participating in the state insurance program. For insurance eligibility purposes, earned service credit is time earned and established with one of the plans administered by PEBA Retirement Benefits [South Carolina Retirement System (SCRS), Police Officers Retirement System (PORS), General Assembly Retirement System (GARS), or Judges and Solicitors Retirement System (JSRS)]. Insurance eligibility also can be earned by time worked while participating in the State Optional Retirement Program (State ORP) or time worked with a local subdivision that participates in PEBA Insurance Benefits but not with PEBA Retirement Benefits. This includes time that you worked for an employer that participates in the state insurance program, even if you did not participate in coverage offered through the program. Periods of non-qualified service, federal service, military service and out-of-state service purchased in the retirement systems, as well as sick leave and service with employers that do not participate in the state insurance program, do not count toward earned service with PEBA Insurance Benefits. State ORP participants cannot purchase time to meet eligibility. Service as a TERI participant in a full-time, permanent position with a participating employer may be applied toward earned service credit to determine retiree insurance eligibility. These funding provisions apply to retirees of state agencies, public school districts and higher education institutions. Funded retirees (Employer pays its part of the premium)To be eligible for funded retiree insurance, you must be eligible to retire and have at least 25 years of earned service credit with an employer that participates in the state insurance program. The last five years of service must be served consecutively in a full-time, permanent position. Your former employer pays 100 percent of the employer's share, and you pay the retiree's share. Partially funded retirees (You split the employer's part of the premium) To be eligible for partially funded retiree insurance, you must be eligible to retire and have at least 15 years, but fewer than 25 years, of earned service credit with an employer that participates in the state insurance program. The last five years of service must be served consecutively in a full-time, permanent position. Your former employer pays 50 percent of the employer's share of the premium. You pay the retiree's share plus the remaining 50 percent of the employer's contribution. Non-funded retirees (You pay the entire premium) To be eligible for non-funded retiree insurance, you must be eligible to retire and have at least five years, but fewer than 15 years, of earned service credit with an employer that participates in the state insurance program. The last five years of service must be served consecutively in a full-time, permanent position. As a non-funded retiree, you pay the entire cost of the insurance. There is no contribution from your former employer. Medicare and retirement This section of the Retirement and Disability INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016169 RETIREMENT AND DISABILITYchapter provides basic information about ways in which you could become eligible for Medicare. To learn more about how health insurance offered through PEBA works with Medicare: Read PEBA's When You Become Eligible for Medicare handbook Call PEBA at 803.737.6800 or 888.260.9430. To learn more about Medicare: Read Medicare and You 2016 Go to the Medicare website at www.medicare.gov Call Medicare at 800.633.4227 or 877.486.2048 (TTY). Medicare before age 65: Disability retirees If you or your eligible spouse or child becomes eligible for Medicare before age 65 due to disability, you must notify PEBA within 31 days of Medicare eligibility by sending in a copy of your Medicare card. If you or a covered family member becomes eligible for Medicare before age 65, you MUST notify PEBA within 31 days of eligibility. If you do not notify PEBA of your Medicare eligibility, and PEBA continues to pay benefits as if it were your primary insurance, when PEBA discovers you are or a member of your family is eligible for Medicare, PEBA will: Begin paying benefits as if you were covered by Medicare Seek reimbursement for overpaid claims back to the date your or your covered family member(s) became eligible for Medicare. Because Medicare is primary (pays first) over your retiree health insurance (except during the 30-month end-stage renal disease coordination of benefits period), when you become eligible for Medicare, you must enroll in Medicare Part A, and it is strongly advised that you enroll in Part B. If you are not covered by Part B, you will be required to pay the portion of your health care costs Part B would have paid. A chart showing how the Medicare Supplemental Plan and the Standard Plan pay with Medicare is in PEBA's When You Become Eligible for Medicare handbook. To enroll in the Medicare Supplemental Plan, you must complete a Retiree Notice of Election form. Send it to PEBA if you worked for a state agency, a college or university or a public school district. If you worked for a local subdivision, send it to your benefits administrator. Coverage will begin the first of the month after PEBA is notified that you are covered by Medicare. Medicare at 65 if you are retired At age 65, Medicare is primary (pays first) over your retiree health insurance. You must be covered by Medicare Part A, and it is strongly advised that you be covered by Part B. If you are not covered by Medicare Part A and Part B, you will be required to pay the portion of your health care costs Medicare would have paid. Medicare's Initial Enrollment Period starts three months before your 65th birthday, includes the month of your birthday and extends three months past the month you turn 65. If you are not receiving Social Security Even if you are not enrolled in Medicare, PEBA will still become secondary when you become eligible for Medicare.RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY170 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016benefits, you should ask about enrolling in Medicare three months before you turn age 65 so your Medicare coverage can start the month you turn 65. If you are receiving Social Security benefits, you should be notified of Medicare eligibility by the Social Security Administration (SSA) three months before you reach age 65. Medicare Part A starts automatically. It is strongly advised that you enroll in Part B. If you are not notified, contact your local Social Security office immediately. If you decide not to receive Social Security benefits until you reach your full Social Security retirement age, you must still be covered by Medicare Part A and Part B. We recommend you contact the SSA within three months of your 65th birthday to enroll. The SSA will bill you quarterly for Part B premiums. If you are an active employee at age 65 If you are actively working and/or covered under a state health insurance plan for active employees, you may delay enrollment in Part B because your insurance as an active employee remains primary. If you are an active employee but your spouse is eligible for Medicare, your spouse should enroll in Part A but may delay enrollment in Part B until you retire and your active coverage ends. Please note: If you or your spouse defer Part B and later elect to enroll in Part B while you are still actively at work, a gain of Part B is not a special eligibility situation that would permit you to drop health coverage with PEBA. You must wait until open enrollment, which occurs yearly in October, or within 31 days of a special eligibility situation to drop your health coverage.Please note: If you are an active employee, you cover your spouse under a state health insurance plan for active employees and your spouse is eligible for Medicare due to disability, your spouse may delay enrollment in Part B because your insurance as an active employee remains primary. If your spouse's eligibility is due to end-stage renal disease, contact PEBA. When you leave active employment after age 65 Social Security has a special enrollment rule for employees ending active employment after age 65. You should contact the Social Security Administration (SSA) at least 90 days before you retire to ensure that you or your covered spouse or child's Medicare Part A and Part B coverage begins on the same date as your retiree coverage. Please check with the SSA to make sure you are covered by Medicare Part A. It is strongly advised that you be covered by Part B because Medicare becomes your primary coverage. A chart showing how the Medicare Supplemental Plan and the Standard Plan pay with Medicare is in PEBA's When You Become Eligible for Medicare handbook. You may enroll in the Medicare Supplemental Plan within 31 days of the date your active coverage ends. To do so, complete a Retiree Notice of Election form and send it to the PEBA if you are retiring from a state agency, a college or university or a public school district. Give the RNOE to your benefits administrator. If you are retiring from a local subdivision, give the form to your benefits administrator. If your spouse or child is eligible for Medicare If you are a retiree and your spouse or child INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016171 RETIREMENT AND DISABILITYis eligible for Medicare and you are not, they can enroll in the Medicare Supplemental Plan. Family members who are not eligible for Medicare will be covered under the Standard Plan provisions. Sign up for Parts A and B of Medicare You must be covered by both Part A and Part B of Medicare to receive full benefits with any state-offered retiree group health plan. If you are not covered by both parts of Medicare, you will be required to pay the portion of your health care costs Medicare Part B would have paid regardless of enrollment. How Turning down Part B Affects Medicare Coverage Unless you are covered as an active employee at the time, if you turn down Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you must wait until Medicare's General Enrollment Period. This period is from January 1 to March 31 of each year, and coverage begins on July 1. Your Medicare premium will be 10 percent higher for each year you were not covered by Part B after you were first eligible. Contact Medicare for enrollment details and for premium information that applies specifically to you. Enrolling in insurance coverage as a retiree Your insurance is NOT automatically continued when you retire. In addition to completing your retirement paperwork through PEBA retirement benefits, to continue your coverage, you must enroll in retiree insurance with PEBA insurance benefits. To do so, you must complete the Retiree Notice of Election form and the Employment Verification Record. It is recommended that you submit these forms 30 days before your retirement date. This will allow time to process your enrollment so that your insurance coverage as a retiree starts the day your coverage as an active employee ends. You must submit a Retiree Notice of Election form and an Employment Verification Record within 31 days of the date you retire or a special eligibility situation.

After PEBA Insurance Benefits processes your retiree insurance enrollment, you will receive a letter from PEBA Insurance Benefits confirming the coverage selected and the premiums due each month. You have 31 days from the date your retiree insurance becomes effective to make any corrections or changes to your coverage. Otherwise, you must wait to make changes until the next open enrollment period, which occurs yearly in October, or a special eligibility situation. If you do not enroll within 31 days of eligibility, your next opportunity to add or drop dental coverage will be during open enrollment in October of an odd-numbered year. Note: While some benefits administrators may help you complete your Retiree Notice of Election and Employment Verification Record, it is your responsibility to make sure the forms are received by PEBA within 31 days of your retirement date. MoneyPlus accounts To learn how retirement affects your Medical Spending Account and your Dependent Care Spending Account, see Pages 152-153.Within 31 days of a special eligibility situation A special eligibility situation is created by certain events.

If this happens, you will receive a monthly bill for the premiums until you receive your first retirement check. If you do not pay the bill, the total premiums due will be deducted from your first retirement check. Your pension is paid at the end of the month, and your insurance premiums are paid at the beginning of the month. For example: your insurance premiums for April are deducted from your March retirement check. Depending INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016173 RETIREMENT AND DISABILITYon when your retirement paperwork is processed, more than one month's premium may be deducted from your first retirement check.

If you or a member of your family is covered by Medicare Medicare cannot be the primary insurance for you, or for any of your covered family members, while you are employed in a benefits-eligible job, according to federal law. To comply with this regulation, you are required to suspend your retiree group coverage and enroll as an active employee with Medicare as the secondary payer, or refuse all PEBA- sponsored health coverage for yourself and your eligible family members and have Medicare coverage only. If you enroll in active group coverage, you must notify the Social Security Administration (SSA), since Medicare will pay after or secondary to your active group coverage. You may remain enrolled in Medicare Part B and continue paying the premium, and Medicare will be the secondary payer. You may also delay or drop Medicare Part B without a penalty while you have active group coverage. Contact the SSA for additional information. When you stop working and your active group coverage ends, you may re-enroll in retiree group coverage within 31 days of your active termination date. In addition, you must notify the SSA that you are no longer covered under an active group so that you can re-enroll in Medicare Part B, if you dropped it earlier. If your new position does not make you eligible for benefits, your retiree group coverage continues, and Medicare remains the primary payer. When coverage ends Your coverage will end: If you do not pay the required premium when it is due. The date it ends for all employees and retirees. The day after your death. Coverage of your family members will end: The date your coverage ends. The date coverage for spouses or children is no longer offered. The last day of the month your spouse or child is no longer eligible for coverage. If your spouse or child's coverage ends, he may be eligible for continuation of coverage under COBRA (see Pages 25-27). If you are dropping a spouse or child from your coverage, you must complete a Notice of Election form within 31 days of the date the spouse or child is no longer eligible for coverage. Death of a retiree If a retiree dies, a surviving family member should contact PEBA to report the death and end the retiree's health coverage. If the deceased was a local subdivision retiree, contact his benefits administrator, who works in the personnel office of his former employer. RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY180 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016Survivors of a retiree Spouses or children who are covered as dependents under the State Health Plan, a dental plan or the State Vision Plan are classified as \"survivors\" when a covered employee or retiree dies. Survivors of funded retirees of a state agency, a higher education institution or a school district may be eligible for a one-year waiver of health insurance premiums. Survivors of non-funded retirees may continue their coverage. However, they must pay the full premium. Participating local subdivisions may, but are not required to, waive the premiums of survivors of retirees, but a survivor may continue coverage, at the full rate, for as long as he is eligible. If you are a retiree of a participating local subdivision, check with your benefits administrator to see whether the waiver applies. To continue coverage, a Survivor Notice of Election form must be completed within 31 days of the subscriber's date of death. A new Benefits ID number will be created, and new identification cards will be issued by carriers of the programs in which the survivors are enrolled. After the first year, a survivor who qualifies for the waiver must pay the full premium to continue coverage. At the end of the waiver, health coverage can be canceled or continued for all covered family members. If coverage is continued, no covered family members can be dropped until open enrollment or within 31 days of a special eligibility situation. If you and your spouse are both covered employees or funded retirees at the time of death, your surviving spouse is not eligible for the premium waiver. Dental and vision premiums are not waived. However, survivors, including survivors of a subscriber enrolled in the TRICARE Supplement Plan and dental and/or vision coverage, can continue coverage by paying the full premium. As a surviving spouse, you can continue coverage until you remarry. If you are a child, you can continue coverage until you are no longer eligible. If you are no longer eligible for coverage as a survivor, you may be eligible to continue coverage under COBRA. If your spouse retired from a state agency, a higher education institution or a school district, contact PEBA Insurance Benefits for more information. If your spouse retired from a local subdivision, contact his benefits administrator. A surviving spouse or child of a military retiree should contact Selman & Company. As long as a survivor remains covered by health, dental or vision insurance, he can add health and vision coverage at open enrollment or within 31 days of a special eligibility situation. Dental coverage can be added or dropped but only during open enrollment in an odd-numbered year or within 31 days of a special eligibility situation. If a survivor has health, dental and vision, and drops all three, he is no longer eligible as a survivor and cannot re-enroll in coverage, even at open enrollment. If a surviving spouse becomes an active employee of a participating employer, he can switch to active coverage. When he leaves active employment, he can go back to survivor coverage within 31 days of the date his coverage ends, if he has not remarried. Until you become eligible for Medicare, your health insurance pays claims the same way it INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016181 RETIREMENT AND DISABILITYdid when you were an active employee.

Footnotes for comparison chart on Page 182: 1After the deductible is met, other benefits are paid at the same level as the SHP Standard Plan. 2To receive the higher level of benefits, subscribers should use a network provider. 3If more than one family member is covered, no family member will receive benefits, other than preventive benefits, until the $7,200 annual family deductible is met. 4Standard Plan subscribers who receive care at a BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina-affiliated PCMH provider will not be charged the $12 copayment for a physician office visit. After Savings Plan and Standard Plan subscribers meet their deductible, they will pay 10 percent coinsurance, rather than 20 percent, for care at a PCMH.

Your provider will file for you. You are responsible for the usual out-of-pocket expenses (deductibles, copayments, coinsurance and non-covered services). However, if you did not use a network provider or if you have a claim for a non-network service, you may have to file the claim yourself. You can get claim forms from your benefits office, PEBA and BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina (BCBSSC). Claim forms also are on PEBA's insurance benefits website, www.eip.sc.gov. You should complete a separate claim form for each individual who received care. To file a claim: Complete the claim form. Attach your itemized bills, which must show: the amount charged; the patient's name; the date(s) and place of service(s); the diagnosis, if applicable; procedure codes; and the provider's name, federal Tax Identification Number or National Provider Identifier (NPI), if available. File claims within 90 days of the date you receive services or as soon as reasonably possible. BCBSSC must receive claims by the end of the calendar year after the year in which expenses are incurred. Otherwise, claims cannot be paid.

The provider should submit the claim on your behalf. Network providers will file claims to the BlueCross BlueShield affiliate in the state where the service was provided. Outside the U.S., you should complete a BlueCard Worldwide International Claim Form and send it to the BlueCard Worldwide Service Center. This claim form is available from your benefits administrator. If services are received from an out-of-network provider, you may be asked to pay-up front for the full cost of the services received. You may also be required to file the claim to BlueCross yourself. The Worldwide Claim Form is also available on the \"Forms and Documents\" page, which is under \"Member Resources\" on the state-specific BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina website, Statesc.southcarolinablues.com.

Assigning benefits means you authorize your dentist to file your claims and to receive payment from the plan for your treatment. To do this, show a staff member in your dentist's office your dental identification card and ask that the claim be filed for you. Be sure to sign the payment authorizations in blocks 36 and 37 of the claim form. BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina (BCBSSC) will then pay your dentist directly. You are responsible for the difference between the benefit payment and the actual charge, or the Plan allowance if you are enrolled in Dental Plus and seek services from a network dentist. If your dentist will not file your claims, you can file to BCBSSC. The claim form is available on PEBA's Insurance Benefits website, www.eip.sc.gov, or StateSC.SouthCarolinaBlues.com. Complete blocks 4-23 on the claim form, and ask your dentist to complete blocks 1-2, 24-35 and 48-58. If your dentist will not complete his sections of the form, get an itemized bill showing this information: The dentist's name and address and federal Tax Identification Number or National Provider Identifier (NPI) The patient's name The date of each service The name of and/or procedure code for each service The charge for each service. Attach the bill to the completed claim form and mail it to the address on the form:BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina State Dental Claims Department P.O. Box 100300 Columbia, SC 29202-3300. X-rays, office records and other diagnostic aids may be needed to determine the benefit for some dental procedures. Your dentist may be asked to provide this documentation for review by BCBSSC's dental consultant. The plan will not pay a fee to your dentist for providing this information. A completed claim form must be received by BCBSSC within 90 days after the beginning of care or as soon as reasonably possible. It must be filed no later than 24 months after charges were incurred, except in the absence of legal capacity, or benefits will not be paid. What if I need help?You can call BCBSSC at 888.214.6230.

On the following pages is a copy of your Initial COBRA Notice. When you became covered under group benefits offered by the State of South Carolina through the South Carolina Public Employee Benefit Authority (PEBA), you received an Initial COBRA Notice. This notice contains important information about your right to continue your coverage if you lose it under certain circumstances, as well as other health coverage alternatives that may be available to you through the Health Insurance Marketplace. It also explains what you must do to protect your right to continued coverage. It is important that you read this notice. It is also important that each family member you cover be familiar with this information. If you cover a family member who does not live with you, you must notify your benefits office so a COBRA notice can be sent to him. Also, if you move, please inform your benefits office of your new address or change your address through MyBenefits, PEBA's online insurance enrollment system. Under the rules of the plan and federal law, you must notify your benefits office of certain events, including your divorce or legal separation, or if a person you cover loses eligibility under the rules of the plan. Please carefully read the section in the notice about your notification responsibilities. If you fail to follow the procedures, your rights under COBRA could be lost. Additional information about COBRA is on Pages 25-27. If you have questions about this notice or your rights and responsibilities under COBRA, please contact your benefits administrator. YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER COBRA What is COBRA continuation coverage? Under the federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), coverage under the State of South Carolina Public Employee Benefits Authority (PEBA) Insurance Benefits may be continued when it otherwise would end due to a qualifying event. This continuation of coverage is typically referred to as \"COBRA coverage\" but it is actually the same coverage that PEBA Insurance Benefits gives to other participants or beneficiaries under the state insurance program who are not receiving COBRA coverage. Each qualified beneficiary who elects COBRA coverage will have the same rights as other participants or beneficiaries, including open enrollment and special enrollment rights. COBRA (and the description of COBRA coverage contained in this notice) applies only to the group health benefits offered by PEBA Insurance Benefits (the Health, Dental, Dental Plus, Vision and APPENDIX202 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016MoneyPlus Medical Spending Account) and not to any other benefits offered by PEBA Insurance Benefits. PEBA Insurance Benefits provides no greater COBRA rights than what COBRA requires\u2014nothing in this notice is intended to expand your rights beyond COBRA's requirements. Who is entitled to elect COBRA coverage?If a qualified beneficiary loses coverage under group health benefits due to one of the qualifying events listed below, the qualified beneficiary will be allowed to continue group health benefits for a specified period of time at group rates. After a qualifying event occurs and any required notice of that event is properly provided to the benefits office, COBRA coverage will be offered to each qualified beneficiary who is losing coverage as a result of that event. Who is a qualified beneficiary?To be a qualified beneficiary, a person: Must have been covered (under Health, Dental, Dental Plus, Vision and/or a MoneyPlus Medical Spending Account) on the day before the qualifying event; AND Must be a covered employee, the covered spouse of the employee or a covered child of the employee. Two situations may occur during the COBRA coverage period that would cause a child (who was not covered at the time of the qualifying event) to gain the status of a qualified beneficiary. These are addressed later in this notice. What is a qualifying event?A qualifying event is a life event that occurs that would cause a qualified beneficiary to lose coverage under group health benefits offered by PEBA Insurance Benefits (Health, Dental, Dental Plus, Vision and/or a MoneyPlus Medical Spending Account). For a Covered Employee - If you are the covered employee, you will experience a qualifying event and will have the right to elect COBRA coverage if you lose your group health benefits because any of the following happens: Your hours of employment are reduced; or Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct. For a Covered Spouse - If you are the covered spouse of an employee, you will experience a qualifying event and will have the right to elect COBRA coverage if you lose your group health benefits because any of the following happens: Your spouse dies; Your spouse's hours of employment are reduced; Your spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his gross misconduct; orINSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016203 APPENDIX You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse. Also, if your spouse (the employee) reduces or eliminates your group health benefits in anticipation of a divorce or legal separation, and a divorce or legal separation later occurs, then the divorce or legal separation may be considered a qualifying event for you even though your coverage was reduced or eliminated before the divorce or separation. For a Covered Child - If you are the covered child of an employee, you will experience a qualifying event and will have the right to elect COBRA coverage if you lose your group health benefits because any of the following happens: Your parent (the employee) dies; Your parent's (the employee) hours of employment are reduced; Your parent's (the employee) employment ends for any reason other than his gross misconduct; or You stop being eligible for coverage under PEBA Insurance Benefits as a child (for example, you turn age 26). For more information about when a child ceases to be eligible for coverage under PEBA Insurance Benefits, please refer to your Insurance Benefits Guide. What do you do when a qualifying event occurs? YOU MUST GIVE NOTICE OF SOME QUALIFYING EVENTS: divorce, legal separation, and a child loses eligibility for coverage. For these qualifying events, the benefits office will offer you COBRA coverage only if you notify the benefits office within 60 days after the later of: (1) the date of the qualifying event; and (2) the date on which the qualified beneficiary loses (or would lose) coverage under PEBA Insurance Benefits as a result of the qualifying event. To notify the benefits office of these qualifying events, complete the \"Notice of COBRA Qualifying Event\" form and deliver it to the benefits office at the address on the first page of this document. See \"How do you provide a proper and timely notice?\" for details. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment, you do not need to notify the benefits office of any of these qualifying events. The benefits office will offer COBRA coverage to the appropriate qualified beneficiaries. When the qualifying event is the death of the employee, the benefits office will offer survivor coverage. Refer to the Insurance Benefits Guide for details. How do you provide a proper and timely notice?Any notice that you provide must be in writing and must be submitted on the forms provided by PEBA Insurance Benefits. These forms are available at no cost from the benefits office or PEBA Insurance Benefits at 803.737.6800 (toll-free at 888.260.9430) or can be printed from www.eip.sc.gov. Oral notice, including notice by telephone, is not acceptable. Procedures for making a proper and timely notice are: Step 1 - Complete the proper form. Step 2 - Make a copy of the form for your records.APPENDIX204 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016Step 3 - Attach the required documentation depending upon the qualifying event (as indicated on the form). Step 4- Mail or hand-deliver the form and required documentation.Step 5- Call within 10 days to ensure the form and required documentation have been received. If mailed, your notice must be postmarked no later than the last day of the applicable notice period. If hand-delivered, your notice must be received by the individual at the address specified for delivery no later than the last day of the applicable notice period. How can you elect COBRA coverage?Once the benefits office learns a qualifying event has occurred, the qualified beneficiaries will be notified of their rights to elect COBRA coverage. Each qualified beneficiary has an independent election right and has 60 days to elect coverage. The 60-day election window is measured from the later of the date coverage is lost due to the event or from the date of notification to the qualified beneficiaries. This is the maximum period allowed to elect COBRA coverage. PEBA Insurance Benefits does not provide an extension of the election period beyond what is required by law. The covered employee or the employee's covered spouse can elect continuation coverage on behalf of all qualified beneficiaries. A parent may elect to continue coverage on behalf of a covered child who is losing coverage as a result of the qualifying event. For each qualified beneficiary who elects to continue group health benefits, COBRA coverage will begin on the date that coverage under PEBA Insurance Benefits would be lost because of the event. If COBRA coverage is not elected for a qualified beneficiary within the 60-day election window, he will lose all rights to elect COBRA coverage and will cease to be a qualified beneficiary. How long does COBRA coverage last for Health, Dental, Dental Plus and/or Vision?COBRA coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage. The COBRA coverage periods described here are maximum coverage periods. 18 months - When the loss of coverage is due to the end of employment (other than for reasons of gross misconduct) or reduction in hours of employment, coverage under the Health, Dental, Dental Plus and Vision components generally may be continued up to 18 months. There are three possible situations that may provide coverage beyond 18 months when loss of coverage is due to end of employment or reduction in hours of employment. 1. Medicare Entitlement Rule (for covered dependents only) - When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the employee's hours of employment, and the employee became entitled to Medicare benefits during the 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA coverage for qualified beneficiaries (other than the employee) can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. For example, if a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare eight (8) months before the date on which employment ends, his spouse and children who are qualified beneficiaries who lost coverage as a result of his termination INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016205 APPENDIXwill be offered 28 months of continuation coverage (36-8=28). The covered employee, however, is offered only 18 months. This COBRA coverage period is available only if the covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare during the 18 months before the end of employment or reduction of hours. 2. Social Security Disability Extension - If any of the qualified beneficiaries is determined by the Social Security Administration to be disabled, the maximum COBRA coverage period that results from a covered employee's end of employment or reduction of hours (generally 18 months) may be extended to a total of up to 29 months. This extension is available only for qualified beneficiaries who are receiving COBRA coverage because of a qualifying event that was the employee's termination of employment or reduction of hours. The Social Security Administration must determine that the qualified beneficiary's disability started before the 61st day after the covered employee's termination of employment or reduction of hours and the disability must last until at least the end of the 18-month period of continuation coverage. To qualify for the disability extension, you must notify your COBRA ADMINISTRATOR in writing at the address where you deliver your COBRA premium payments of the Social Security Administration's determination of disability and you must do so within 60 days after the latest of: The date of the Social Security Administration's disability determination; The date the covered employee's employment ended or the date of reduction of hours; and The date the qualified beneficiary loses (or would lose) coverage under PEBA Insurance Benefits as a result of the covered employee's termination or reduction of hours. You also must provide this notice within 18 months after the covered employee's employment ended or his hours were reduced to be entitled to a disability extension. In providing this notice, you must use PEBA Insurance Benefits' form, \"Notice to Extend COBRA Continuation Coverage\" (you may obtain a copy of this form from the benefits office or PEBA Insurance Benefits at no charge, or you can print the form at www.eip.sc.gov under \"Forms\"). You must follow the notice procedures outlined in the section entitled \"How do you provide a proper and timely notice?\" I f these procedures are not followed or if the notice is not provided during the 60-day notice period and within 18 months after the covered employee's employment ended or hours were reduced, THERE WILL BE NO DISABILITY EXTENSION OF COBRA COVERAGE. 3. Second Qualifying Event Extension - If your family experiences a second qualifying event during the 18 months (or, in the case of a disability extension, the 29 months) following the covered employee's end of employment or reduction of hours, the maximum COBRA coverage period may be extended to a total of up to 36 months from the date of the original qualifying event. Such second qualifying events may include the death of the employee, divorce or legal separation from the employee, or dependent child losing eligibility for coverage under PEBA Insurance Benefits. APPENDIX206 INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016This extension due to a second qualifying event is available only if you notify your COBRA ADMINISTRATOR in writing at the address where you deliver your COBRA premium payments of the second qualifying event within 60 days after the date of the second qualifying event. In providing this notice, you must use PEBA Insurance Benefits' form entitled \"Notice to Extend COBRA Continuation Coverage.\" (You may obtain a copy of this form from PEBA Insurance Benefits at no charge, or you can print the form at www.eip.sc.gov.) You must follow the procedures specified in the section entitled \"How do you provide a proper and timely notice?\" If these procedures are not followed or if the notice is not provided during the 60-day notice period, THERE WILL BE NO EXTENSION OF COBRA COVERAGE DUE TO A SECOND QUALIFYING EVENT. 36 months - When the loss of coverage is due to the death of the employee, divorce or legal separation from the employee, or a child losing eligibility for coverage under PEBA Insurance Benefits, a spouse or child who is a qualified beneficiary will have the opportunity to continue coverage under Health, Dental, Dental Plus and Vision for 36 months from the date of the original qualifying event. How long does COBRA coverage last for the MoneyPlus Medical Spending Account (MSA)?COBRA coverage under the MoneyPlus Medical Spending Account (MSA) can last only until the end of the plan year, including the grace period, in which the qualifying event occurred. The period of COBRA coverage under the MoneyPlus MSA cannot be extended under any circumstances. COBRA coverage under the MoneyPlus MSA will be offered only to a qualified beneficiary losing coverage who has an \"underspent account.\" An account is underspent if the annual limit elected under the MoneyPlus MSA by the covered employee, reduced by reimbursable claims submitted up to the time of the qualifying event, is equal to or more than the amount of the contributions for MoneyPlus MSA COBRA coverage that will be charged for the remainder of the plan year. COBRA coverage will consist of the MoneyPlus MSA coverage in force at the time of the qualifying event (i.e., the elected annual limit reduced by reimbursable claims submitted up to the time of the qualifying event). The use-it-or-lose-it rule will continue to apply, so any unused amounts will be forfeited at the end of the plan year, including the grace period. COBRA coverage will terminate at the end of the plan year. Unless otherwise elected, all qualified beneficiaries who were covered under the MoneyPlus MSA will be covered together for continuation under COBRA coverage. However, each qualified beneficiary could alternatively elect separate COBRA coverage to cover that beneficiary only, with a separate annual limit and a separate contribution How much does COBRA coverage cost?Generally, each qualified beneficiary is required to pay 100 percent of the applicable premium for the coverage that is continued, plus a 2 percent administration charge. The premium includes both the employee's and employer's share of the total premium. If continuation coverage is extended due to a disability and the disabled qualified beneficiary elects the extension, the rate is 150 percent of the applicable premium. If only non-disabled qualified beneficiaries extend coverage, the rate will remain at 102 percent.INSURANCE BENEFITS GUIDE | 2016207 APPENDIXThere may be other coverage options for you and your family. When key parts of the health care law take effect, you'll be able to buy coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. In the Marketplace, you could be eligible for a new kind of tax credit that lowers your monthly premiums right away, and you can see what your premium, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs will be before you make a decision to enroll. Being eligible for COBRA does not limit your eligibility for coverage for a tax credit through the Marketplace. Additionally, you may qualify for a special enrollment opportunity for another group health plan for which you are eligible (such as a spouse's plan), even if the plan generally does not accept late enrollees, if you request enrollment within 30 days. More information about individuals who may be qualified beneficiariesChildren born to or placed for adoption with the covered employee during COBRA coverage period A child born to, adopted by, or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA coverage is considered to be a qualified beneficiary provided that, if the covered employee is a qualified beneficiary, the covered employee has elected COBRA coverage for himself or herself. The child's COBRA coverage begins when the child is enrolled in the PEBA Insurance Benefits' plan, whether through special enrollment or open enrollment, and it lasts for as long as COBRA coverage lasts for other family members of the employee. To be enrolled in PEBA Insurance Benefits' plan, the child must satisfy the applicable eligibility requirements (for example, regarding age). Alternate recipients under QMCSOs or NMSNsA child of the covered employee who is receiving benefits under PEBA Insurance Benefits pursuant to a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) or National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) received by PEBA Insurance Benefits during the covered employee's period of employment is entitled to the same rights to elect COBRA as an eligible child of the covered employee. Are there other coverage options besides COBRA continuation coverage?Yes. Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse's plan) through what is called a \"special enrollment period.\" Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov.
