The holotoxin comprises 952 residues forming six subunits (five different sequences, S1-S5). It plays an important role in the development of protective immunity to whooping cough, and is an essential component of new acellular vaccines ... Pertussis toxin is an exotoxin of the A-B class produced by Bordetella pertussis. The holotoxin comprises 952 residues forming six subunits (five different sequences, S1-S5). It plays an important role in the development of protective immunity to whooping cough, and is an essential component of new acellular vaccines. It is also widely used as a biochemical tool to ADP-ribosylate GTP-binding proteins in the study of signal transduction.
