Combining Eastern and Western trauma physiology, clinician-educators Alaine Duncan and Kathy Kain introduce a new map for acupuncturists, medical practitioners, mental health providers, and body-oriented clinicians to help restore balance in their patients. Using concepts from acupuncture and Asian medicine (AAM), alongside descriptions of the threat response from Western biobehavioral science, they describe common physical symptoms, emotional presentations, and paths for healing for five survivor \"types\" detailed by the authors and correlated to the five elements of AAM. This ancient/modern integrative lens illuminates the diverse manifestations of traumatic stress in its survivors - chronic pain, autoimmune illness, insomnia, metabolic problems, and mental health disorders - and brings new hope to survivors of trauma and those who treat them. PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio. Critic reviews \"In bringing together the Five Elements theory from Acupuncture and Asian Medicine, along with a somatically based understanding of trauma, this book fulfills an important role in the deep healing of trauma and stress-related disorders. The insights from this clearly written volume are tremendously important for therapists, bodyworkers, acupuncturists, physicians, and other healers. It will also help individuals better understand their perplexing symptoms and find pathways to healing.\" (Peter A. Levine, PhD, author of Waking the Tiger, In an Unspoken Voice, and Trauma and Memory and developer of the Somatic Experiencing model of trauma healing) \"I highly recommend The Tao of Trauma to therapists of all disciplines. It is a unique synthesis of Eastern and Western scholarly research and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of trauma and is especially pertinent with the growing awareness of post-traumatic stress as the root cause of many public health issues. It is richly illustrated with case histories and gives detailed instructions for helping clients complete the process of healing, not merely suppressing their symptoms.\" (Peter Eckman, MD, PhD, MAc(UK), author of In the Footsteps of the Yellow Emperor, Emotions Revealed, and The Compleat Acupuncturist) \"Alaine Duncan and Kathy Kain use contemporary neuroscience to bridge the classic Five Element model of Acupuncture and Asian Medicine (AAM) with Somatic Experiencing. Through this integration a new understanding of traumatic experiences emerges that leads to more effective treatment.\" (Stephen W. Porges, PhD, professor, department of psychiatry, University of North Carolina; distinguished university scientist, Kinsey Institute, Indiana University Bloomington, Indiana; developer, polyvagal theory) What listeners say about The Tao of TraumaAverage customer ratings Reviews - Please select the tabs below to change the source of reviews. - Overall - Performance - Story - [Terra's Mom](/listener/amzn1.account.AHNUZTPHOHUKXEL7AKMAIEVGCATA?ref=a_pd_The-Ta_c15_rvlsnl_0&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=825WWQZA62MMZHR3JZNQ&pageLoadId=jew4W5xMW3Ql7vD5&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 09-22-20 Powerful Approach to Trauma Healing I am a psychotherapist specializing in trauma. The author explicated so beautifully, interweaving both Western and Five Element Acupuncture understandings, a powerful path for true trauma healing. I have a much clearer perspective on how trauma impacts all the body and energetic systems. This book made me wish I was trained in Five Element Acupuncture! Next best, I am now considering finding an acupuncturist in my area to collaborate with. Although I may not be able to practice all of the interventions in this book, I believe my awareness of the systems at play will help me be a more effective provider. The issue of incorporating touch into psychotherapy is so controversial. I have much to contemplate in that regard as well, and may seek further training. I highly recommend this book!!! If you are an acupuncturist or someone who is licensed to work with clients hands on , so much the better!!! 1 person found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Shrimp Cuddlebuns](/listener/amzn1.account.AG5OY2VTIJGO2T44JW66G5J4TFZA?ref=a_pd_The-Ta_c15_rvlsnl_1&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=825WWQZA62MMZHR3JZNQ&pageLoadId=jew4W5xMW3Ql7vD5&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 01-04-20 I can't believe I'm reading this If this book makes you angry at the beginning take a break from it and come back, don't give up on it. If it triggers you, stop and come back, don't give up on it. This may be extremely difficult for me because 3 years abuse by the hands of a doctor and 6 traumas directly following that abuse plus one trauma that the attacker was a doctor that left me in pain for over a year every day (still going on) that only happened because another doctor coerced me into it threatening torturing me if I didn't go to the doctor that did malpractice... oh and 18 years of childhood abuse. My doctors are out of ideas how to help me. they're recommending the stuff in this book to me and they probably can lose their job for recommending this book to me but they're that out of ideas. It honestly doesn't matter if this book works or not it's one of my only hopes. I'm in a rare situation as a Westerner where I can say a medical professional recommended this to me. one more thing to note when reading: it's poetic, think of it like poetry and the science makes more sense, just trust me on that one. I'm not saying I recommend this book, I'm saying what do you have to lose if nothing else works?
