The provision of HIV care and treatment services consistent with the most recent US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines and provided in the context of an on going relationship with a personal provider who has comprehensive knowledge of the patient 's medical conditions; facilitates linkages to and provides information to sub -specialists or other services involved in the care of the patient and actively particip ates in coordinating care with other qualified professionals. To ensure the quality of care, primary care and HIV care should be delivered in the same place. If this cannot be done, the overall health care of patient s with HIV infection must be carefully managed to maximize health outcomes. Given the improved survival among persons living with HIV infection, and studies that suggest those living with HIV are at higher risk for developing comorbid health problems, the provider must monitor people living with HIV for all relevant age and gender specific health problems and referred for appropriate testing and/or treatment as needed. The standards do not dictate whether People who have HIV should receive their care from a specialist or a generalist. The emphasis is the importance of the primary care needs of persons with HIV infection and that patient s have better outcomes when they receive their care from experienced HIV care providers. The HIV Medical Association and t he American Academy of HIV Medicine provide guidelines for what is considered an experienced HIV care provider. The medical home model of care is recommended, in which a multidisciplinary team of health providers with specific roles coordinates a comprehe nsive, personalized, patient - centered approach. It is the responsibility of the provider to implement strategies to retain patient s in care, re -engage patient s who have been out of care and to ensure that all efforts translate into improved health outcomes for the patient . 1 SERVICE CATEGORY DEFINITION Outpatient/Ambulatory Health Services (OAHS) provide diagnostic and therapeutic -related activities directly to a patient by a licensed healthcare provider in an outpatient medical setting. Outpatient medical settings may include clinics, medical offices, mobile vans, using telehealth technology, and urgent care facilities for HIV -related visits. Allowable activities include : Medical history taking Physical examination Diagnostic testing (including HIV confirmatory and viral load testing), as well as laboratory testing Treatment and management of physical and behavioral health conditions Behavioral risk assessment, subsequ ent counseling, and referral Preventive care and screening Pediatric developmental assessment Prescription and management of medication therapy Treatment adherence Education and counseling on health and prevention issues Referral to and provision of specialty care related to HIV diagnosis, including audiology and ophthalmology Program Guidance: Treatment adherence activities provided during an Outpatient/Ambulatory Health Service visit are considered Outpatient/Ambulatory Health Services, whereas trea tment adherence activities provided during a Medical Case Management visit are considered Medical Case Management services. Non -HIV related visits to urgent care facilities are not allowable costs within the Outpatient/Ambulatory Health Services Category. Emergency room visits are not allowable costs within the Outpatient/Ambulatory Health Services Category.

Red Carpet Entry Providers commit to providing patients with an appointment with an HIV specialist within 72 hours following initial clinic contact, a designated RCE- site contact or \"concierge\" to facilitate the first appointment, and a password phrase that would enable a patient to discreetly ask for services once they arrived at the site. 1.Clients seeking RCE referral may use the RCE site specific password phrase such as \"I would like to make an appointment with Dr. White\" or ask for \"Red Carpet Entry\" 2. All members of the clinic staff who have initial contact with public (i.e. clinic receptionist, triage staff, or unit clerk) should be aware of RCE password phrase and RCE program to ensure proper linkage of client to RCE concierge 3. The minimum level of care for HIV requires patients to receive the following screenings or referrals during their first appointment with an HIV provider: Antiretroviral Medications (Rapid Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)) Confirmatory HIV test Viral Load and CD4 lab work Tuberculosis test Hepatitis test STD testing HAHSTA is available to provide technical assistance to support the implementation and evaluation of the Red Carpet Entry Program. If RCE providers encounter questions or concerns related to the Red Carpet Entry Program, they are encouraged to contact the D.C. Department of Health HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD at email redcarpet@dc.gov . More information can be found on https://dchealth.dc.gov/red-carpet- entry-program The District of Columbia Department of Health (DC Health) supports evidence-based, patient centered initiatives to reduce HIV transmission, improve the lives of people diagnosed with HIV, and reduce health disparities. DC Health recommends rapid ART initiation as soon as possible following HIV diagnosis. For more information see DC Health Notices ( here) Standards These standards are designed to ensure consistency among Part A services provided as part of the District of Columbia's EMA continuum of care for PLWH. These are minimum standards for the provision of the OAHS service. Sub- recipients and individuals may exceed these standards. These standards do not supersede the scope of practice for all the eligible practitioners and complement the HHS HIV treatment guidelines. The following aspects are highlighted in this document: 7 Red Carpet Entry Program and RAPID ART Comprehensive medical history (baseline) Comprehensive Physical Examination Follow-Up Visits/Progress of Treatment Routine Laboratory and Diagnostic Assessments Antiretroviral Treatment Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections and Vaccines Health promotion and Psychosocial Assessments Coordination and Linkage to services Case Closure In this standard, when the term \"clinically indicated\" is used, it refers to the need to perform tests and/or examinations that could have clinically relevant benefits for the health outcome, could assess response to therapy, or address a symptom or functional problem. The provider must clearly document the clinical rationale that governs the decision for performing the examination or test. STANDARD I: COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL HISTORY (BASELINE) Providers must ensure patients undergo triage at intake to determine if urgent or emergent care is needed and then treat as appropriate.

There may be some exceptions, at practitioner's discretion when patient have demonstrated long - term stability and adherence to treatment, frequency may be altered, reduced , or increased. Frequency of visits may also change if a patient is experiencing acute problems that requires intense monitoring. Provider should accommodat e such need to ensure quality of care is provided. At minimum, a medical visit for a returning patient will include a problem focused history, problem -focused examination, and straightforward medical decision -making. Standards Elements of Follow -up visits Measures Follow -up visits should be scheduled more frequently at entry to care, when starting or changing ART regimens, or for management of acute problems Routinely, Follow -up visits for patients receiving ART therapy should be scheduled every three to six months, except at the practitioner's discretion when a patient has demonstrated long -term stability and adherence in his/her medical regime. Monitor one to three months if adherence is unstable. DHHS guidelines require at least two visits annually. Follow -up visits should be scheduled every three to six months for patients who are not receiving ART therapy.

For patients who have no history of TB or positive PPD tests, a PPD test or Interferon -Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) should be performed at least annually, with results recorded. Record attempts to follow up with patients who do not return for PPD reading. For all positive IGRA tests and PPD tests of at least five millimeters of induration, a chest X -ray should be obtained to rule out active pulmonary disease, and, if appropriate, prophylaxis Documentation of annual screening in patient medical records and treatment if clinically indicated Patient medical record to confirm referrals and/or content of follow -up visit 16 Standards Elements of Follow -up visits Measures women) and safer sex discussions and documentation should be given. If there is a history of a positive PPD or IGRA, any record of prophylactic treatment should be noted in the chart. Risk assessment for TB should be assessed annually with a symptom screen to detect acute disease (CDC: Treatment of LTBI and TB for persons with HIV and Clinical info HIV.gov> Mycobacterium tuberculosis ) OAHS services should provide patient encounters: Encounters will include: HIV and STI prevention messages Treatment adherence counseling and support as needed Nutrition screening, and referrals as needed Social living conditions review Patient education on HIV disease, symptoms Medications and treatment regimens Regular discussions of family planning and contraception should be conducted with female patients. For patients who are pregnant, some medical providers may wish to refer their pregnant women with HIV to an OB specialist in HIV. Documentation of encounters in patient's medical record 17 STANDARD IV: ROUTINE LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING Outpatient Ambulatory Health Services (OAHS) programs must have access to all laboratory services required to comply fully with established practice guidelines for HIV prevention and risk reduction and for the clinical management of HIV disease. Providers must order appropriate laboratory assessments and screening tests for management of PLWH according to DHHS guidelines. All clinical and immunological monitoring should be followed according to the most up to date guidelines as published in the DHHS guideli nes available at https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines Programs must assure timely, quality lab results, readily available for review in medical encounters. Baseline lab tests (preferably at fasting) for all PLWH should include: HIV-RNA viral load CD4 count HIV drug resistance testing Syphilis serology Gonorrhea and Chlamydia - Urine or Cervical, Rectal, and Oral Toxoplasma gondii antibody screening (for people with low CD4 count) Urinalysis Hepatitis A screening for those not previously vaccinated Hepatitis B and C serology* * If the serology for hepat itis C is reactive, then tests to determine whether the patient has chronic hepatitis C infection should be done. If a quantitative hepatitis C viral load is indicated, and if the virus is present, the patient should be counseled and evaluated for hepatiti s treatment, and as appropriate, treatment should be initiated. Complete Blood Count (CBC) Liver function tests Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) Creatinine Protein Albumin Glucose Lipid panel Chest X -ray (if the PPD or IGRA is positive) Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) or IGRA (Quantiferon) Cervical Pap smear (if not done in past year) Follow -up and ongoing lab tests for patients should include, at a minimum: Annual: CBC, liver function tests, BUN, cholesterol, triglycerides (preferably fasting) Every six months: CD4, HIV -RNA, syphilis serology, urine GC/Chlamydia and rectal GC, oral GC/Chlamydia testing for sexually active patients based on risk behavior in accordance with CDC STD Guideline Follow -up and ongoing lab tests for patients on ART should include: CBC, liver function tests, BUN, creatinine, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides (preferably fasting), CD4, HIV -RNA and syphilis serology. Urine GC/Chlamydia, rectal GC, and 18 oral GC/Chlamydia testing should be offered for sexually active patients based on risk behavior CDC Sexually Transmitted Guidelines . DRUG RESISTANCE TESTING At baseline and again w hen appropriate, OAHS practitioners may order drug resistance testing to measure a patient's pattern of resistance of HIV to antiretroviral medications. Genotypic testing looks for viral mutations and is expected for all na\u00efve patients, and phenotypic test ing measures the amount of drug needed to suppress replication of HIV. By using resistance testing, practitioners can determine if the virus is likely to be suppressed by each antiretroviral drug. This information is used to guide practitioners in prescrib ing the most effective drug combinations for treatment. Drug resistance testing services will be based upon most recent established guidelines and standards of care including the PHS Guidelines and the Infectious Disease Society of America Guidelines, as w ell as the DHHS Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents' Recommendations for HIV Viral Load Testing and the CDHS's Recommended General Clinical Guidelines. Counseling and education about drug resistance testing must be provided by th e patient's medical practitioner, RN and/or other appropriate licensed health care provider (if designated by the practitioner). Patients must be fully educated about their medical needs and treatment options according to standards of medical care. Patient s must be given an opportunity to ask questions about their immune system, antiretroviral therapies , and drug resistance testing. All patient education efforts will be documented in the patient record.

These seven classes include the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non -nucleos a CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) - In addition, two drugs, and cobicistat (COBI) are used as pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancers (or boosters) to improve the PK profiles of PIs and the INSTI elvitegravir (EVG). The initial ARV regimen for a treatment -naive patient generally consists of two NRTIs, usually abacavir/ plus one of three drug classes: an INSTI, an NNRTI, or a boosted PI. As shown in clinical trials and by retrospe ctive evaluation of cohorts of patients in clinical care, this strategy for initial treatment has resulted in suppression of HIV replication and CD4 count increases in most person with HIV. Additional data now support the use of the two drug regimen dolute gravir (DTG) plus 3TC for initial treatment of people with HIV ( DHHS Guideline ). FOR ANTIRETROVIRAL (ART ) TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS , PLEASE REFER TO THE (DHHS GUIDELINE WHICH INCLUDES RECOM MENDATIONS REGARDING INITIATION OF ART THERAPY , SELECTION OF AN ART REGIMEN , MONITORING FOR ART -SPECIFIC SIDE EFFECTS , OPTIMIZING TREATMENT ADHERENCE , AND CHANGING REGIMEN S AT Standards Elements Measures ART therapy will be prescribed in accordance with DHHS Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV - infected Adults and Adolescents Same day Rapid ART available in the DC Documentation in patient's medical record Patients will be part of treatment decision -making process.

Enhance clinic support and structures to promote linkage and retention (reminder calls, flexible scheduling, open access, active referrals, and improved patient satisfaction). interventions and progress made toward goals in the individual service plan (as appropriate) 26 B. Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections Refer to current guidelines and prevailing standards for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections from DHHS Guidelines for Opportunistic Infections ( Recommendations for Treating Opportu nity Infections ). Documentation of current therapies should be maintained on all patients receiving prophylaxis. For the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of Opportunistic Infections please refer to the Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportun istic Infections in HIV -infected Adults and at Guidelines for Treatment of Opportunistic Infections for HIV C. Vaccination Schedules for HIV positive Individuals For vaccination schedules for HIV positive children , please refer to the Recommended schedules for HIV positive adults at Recommended Immunization Schedule for Children vaccination schedules for people with medical condition including HIV positive individuals the Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule by Medical Condition and Other Indications, United States, 2020 Recommended Immunization Schedule for Adults STANDARD VI: HEALTH PROMOTION AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENTS The adoption of healthy living and reduction in risk behaviors among HIV -positive people leads to a substantial improvement in the quality of life and a reduction of rates in HIV transmission. It is understood that information alone, especially on subjects such as sexual activity and drug use, cannot be expected to change patient's behavior. However, providers can play a key role in helping patients to understand the transmission r isk of certain types of behavior and help to establish and maintain safer practices, safe disclosure practices and begin personal prevention strategies for themselves and their partners. Standards Elements Measures Practitioners will discuss health maintenance with patients annually (at minimum), including: Cancer screening (per USPSTF : Prostrate Cancer Sc reening 2018 Breast Cancer USPSTF: Recommendation for Breast Cancer 2016 ; BRCA -All health promoting and maintenance education provided. Counseling on use of non - conventional medication and herbal supplements can also be discussed Annual health maintenance discussions will be documented in patient medical records. 27 Standards Elements Measures Related Cancer Risk Assessment Colon Cancer, USPSTF: Colorectal Cancer Screening 2016 Cervical Cancer ; USPSTF: Screening for Cervic al Dysplasia and Cancer 2018 ; NYDOH screening for Cervical Cancer Anal dysplasia for Anal Dysplasia Lung USPSTF Lung Cancer Screen ing Hepatitis screening, vaccination TB screening Influenza vaccine Tetanus/diphtheria update Pneumovax Meningococcal vaccine for high - risk MSM and those who request it Family planning Counseling on safer sex and ST I screening Counseling on food and water safety Counseling on nutrition, Exercise and diet Harm reduction for alcohol and drug use Smoking cessation : HIV Education HIV education Documentation in 28 Standards Elements Measures Providers must educate the customers about HIV at baseline (new to care), annually and as needed . This must include: -The natural history of HIV disease -Goals of HIV disease management -Principles of HIV treatment -Side effects of medication and -Self-monitoring for commonly encountered symptoms HIV life cycle Goals for treatment Antiretroviral medications Symptoms of HIV customer's record that these elements have been addressed or are in process. Risk Reduction Counseling Providers, at each visit with an HIV-positive person, must provide risk reduction counseling to include screening for high -risk behavior. -Provide patients to routine HIV risk reduction counseling -Discussion of safer sexual practices -Discussion of PrEP use by Partners -Link to support for addressing these behaviors Providers must recommend the correct and consistent use of latex or, when latex allergies exist, polyurethane male condoms and should discuss the option of using polyurethane female condoms. Providers must emphasize that transmission of HIV may occur during unprotected sex, even when patient s have undetectable HIV plasma viral loads. Providers must instruct patient s in the proper use of condoms, dental dams, and other barriers to reduce the risk of HIV transmission The need for PrEP for sexual partners Documentation in patient's record that these elements have been addressed or are in process. Disclosure for Social Support Providers must routinely discuss with patients the importance of disclosure for social support and encourage safe disclosure as needed. Those who do not disclose for social support have poorer health outcomes than those who do Documentation of disclosure for social support assessments in patients' medical records Documentation in patient's record that these elements have been addressed or are in process. 29 Standards Elements Measures Promotion of Mental Health Providers must routinely inquire about mental health needs in a culturally appropriate and sensitive manner and link patients to services as needed. Providers must use appropriate screening tools (e.g ., PHQ2, PHQ9, CAGE, MMS, GAIN -SS or other HAHSTA/DC Health approved tools) when performing assessments . Documentation in patients' medical record that these elements have been addre ssed or are in process Substance Abuse Providers must use appropriate screening tools (such as PHQ2, PHQ9, CAGE, MMS, GAIN -SS or other HAHSTA/DC Health approved tools) when performing assessments Providers must not prevent a patient who is actively abusing substances from obtaining access to HIV treatment even if the patient is not participating in substance abuse treatment Providers must routinely inquire about substance abuse and link patient s to services as needed. Substance abuse can cause serious health risks for many including poor adherence to medications and increased disease progression. Under the influence of substances individuals may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors Documentation in patien t record that these elements have been addressed or are in process Treatment Adherence Providers must assess and encourage adherence to both medication and care at each visit. Providers must provide adherence support or link patients to treatment adherence services as clinically This is adherence to bot h a comprehensive care program and an antiretroviral medication regimen. Several factors can interfere with treatment adherence; thus providers need to be knowledgeable and assist patients in addressing them routinely throughout treatment. Documentation of treatment adherence provided as part of the plan of care in medical records 30 Standards Elements Measures indicated. Providers must regularly exchange information with patient's treatment adherence counselor and medical case manager. Smoking Cessation Providers must assess smoking status , provide strategies to promote cessation . Linkages to smoking cessation programs and pharmacotherapy should be provided if the patient is interested. Smoking Cessation Smoking increases risk of thrush, coronary artery disease and bacterial pneumonia. It has been found to reduce the effectiveness of ART treatment in women. HIV infection further increases the risk of lung and other cancers associated with smoking Documentation of smoking assessments, intervention provided and referral to treatment in medical records Domestic Violence Providers must scree n all patients for current and lifetime domestic violence (both as survivors and as perpetrators) at baseline and annually Domestic violence Providers must screen for domestic violence in a culturally sensitive approach Documentation of screening and referral to intervention if positive on patient's medical records STANDARD VII: COORDINATION OF CARE, LINKAGE TO SERVICES AND RETENTION IN CARE As part of the patient 's treatment plan, services outside of the primary care provider's agency may be necessary. The provider is responsible for ensuring that the patient is linked to these services and the patient s care is coordinated. The services may include specialty medic al care, mental health treatment, medical case management, substance use prevention and treatment, housing and social support services. Providers must ensure that linkages include a defined process for information exchange and feedback and a mutually understood method between referrer and referee for enrolling patient s in services. Providers must actively participate in the coordination of services for their patient s. This must include the continuous interchange and exchange of patient treatment information between the patient s designated primary medical care provider and external service providers. Providers must create linkages and/or ref errals that match the patient 's self -identified priorities, as these are more likely to be completed; the services need to be responsive to the patient 's needs and appropriate for the patient 's culture, language, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, age, and developmental level. 31 Providers must use medical case management as appropriate to enhance the coordination of care provided by agencies such as home care, nutrition services, and nursing services and to prevent duplication of services. P roviders must regularly involve medical case managers in case reviews and conferences to discuss all issues that may affect a patient 's ability to adhere to care. A critical support in the coordination of care is the patient 's medical case manager . Emphasized in both the Health and Human Resources Administration (HRSA) definition of medical case management at PCN 16 -02 and, DC Health /HAHSTA Medical Case Management Guidelines is that HIV/AIDS medical case management services focus on 1) retention in medical care and 2) achieving positive health outcomes for patient s, particularly the importance of viral load suppression for those on antiretroviral treatment DC MCM Guideline 2014 . Providers must ensure comprehensive care for patient s either by providing all services or linking them to essential services for good health and outcomes. From the following table guidance can be obtained to address medical co -morbidities and routine age - and gender -specific care. Standard Elements Measures Care Coordination & Linkage OAHS programs will provide medical care coordination services either directly or through cooperative agreement. Services are supervised by an RN and a Master's -level patient care manager and include: Outreach Intake Comprehensive assessment/reass essment Patient acuity assessment Comprehensive treatment plan Implementation and evaluation of comprehensive treatment plan Referral and coordination of care Case conferences Benefits specialty services Documentation of medical care coordination services and/or referral on file in patient medical record 32 HIV prevention, education and counseling Patient retention services Retention in Care Programs will strive to retain patients in OAHS services. To ensure continuity of service and retention of patients, programs will be required to establish a missed appointment policy. Follow -up can include telephone calls, written correspondence and/or direct contact, and strives to maintain a patient's participation in care. Such efforts shall be documented in the progress notes within the patient record. If a pattern of missed appointment s persists, patients must be referred to specialized adherence se rvices and/or medical care coordination for support. Standard Elements Measures Providers of HIV Outpatient/Ambulatory Health Care should systematically assess retention of patient s in care and should implement clinic practices that encourage retention. Programs shall provide regular follow up procedures to encourage and help maintain a patient in medical treatment . Telephone calls Written correspondence Direct contact Other technological means (such as text messaging etc If unable to locate pati ent, Provider should contact HAHSTA's data -to-Care team after numerous attempts or six months which ever one is first. A pattern of missed appointments can lead to discontinuity of medical care services and may be related to underlying mental health, subst ance abuse, financial or other issues A written policy should be on file at provider agency regarding retention in care. A missed appointment policy should be established and implemented. Documentation of attempts to contact patient s at-risk of loss to care should be included in patient records. Document all efforts. 33 STANDARD VIII: CASE CLOSURE Case closure is a systematic process for disenrolling patients from Outpatient ambulatory health services. The process includes formally notifying patients of pending case closure and completing a case closure summary to be kept on file in the patient reco rd. All attempts to contact the patient and notifications about case closure will be documented in the patient file, along with the reason for case closure. Standards Elements Measures OAHS programs will develop case closure criteria and procedures. Cases may be closed when the patient: Relocates out of the service area (out of EMA) Has had no direct program contact in the past six months Can no longer be located Fails to provide updated documentation of eligibility status thus, no longer eligible fo r services Changes his or her primary care provider Is incarcerated long er than one year Uses the service improperly or has not complied with the patient services agreement Exhibits pattern of abuse as defined by agency's policy Withdraws from or refuses funded services, reports that services are no longer needed, or no longer participates in the individual service plan Case closure criteria and procedures on file at provider agency. Patient medical records will include attempts at notification and reason for case closure. Documentation of discharge plan and summary in customer's record with clear rationale for discharge within 30 days of discharge, including certified letter, if applicable. Documentation : Customer's record must include: Date services began Special customer needs Services needed/actions taken, if applicable Date of discharge Reason(s) for discharge Referrals made at time of discharge, if applicable 34 Standards Elements Measures Becomes housed in an \"institutional\" program anticipated to last for a minimum of 30 days, such as a nursing home, prison , or inp atient program Has died STANDARD IX: QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES Quality Management Plan: Every agency that provides HIV medical services must implement an HIV Quality Management Program. The HIV quality management program should be actively supported and guided by the formal clinical leadership and senior administration, and appropriate resources sh ould be committed to support quality improvement activities. Program staff should be aware of the quality management infrastructure and understand their role in quality improvement activities. Each HIV quality management program must have a written annual quality management plan that is reviewed and updated routinely by its quality management committee. Program activities must be informed by consumer input and feedback. Consumers may identify additional concerns and issues for improvement of HIV care.

(Y/N) Adolescent/Adult Guidelines: \"Several laboratory tests are important for initial evaluation of patients with HIV upon entry into care, and some tests should be performed before and after initiation or modification of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to assess the virologic and immunologic efficacy of ART and to monitor for laboratory abno rmalities that may be associated with antiretroviral ( ART ) drugs. Table 3 outlines the Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents (the Panel)'s recommendations on the frequency of testing. As noted in the table, some tests may be repeate d more frequently if clinically indicated. Additionally, Table 3. Laboratory Testing Schedule for Monitoring Patients with HIV Before and After Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy indicates viral load test should be performed at entry into care; ART initi ation or modification; two to eight weeks after ART initiation or modification; in patients on ART every three to six months; every six months of the patient for patients adherent with consistently suppressed viral load and stable immunologic status for mo re than two years; treatment failure; clinically indicated; and if ART initiation is delayed. Pediatric Guidelines: \"After the initial phase of ART initiation (1 month -3 months), 2 clinicians should assess a patient's adherence to the regimen and the regimen's effectiveness (as measured by CD4 cell count and plasma viral load) every 3 months to 4 months. Additionally, clinicians should review a patient's history of toxicities and evaluate a patient for any new AEs using physical examinations and the relevant laboratory tests. If laboratory evidence of toxicity is identified, testing should be performed more frequently u ntil the toxicity resolves.\" The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV 42 finds value in continuing to perform viral load testing every 3 to 4 months to provide enhanced monitoring of adherence or disease progress ion among children and adolescents. Some experts monitor CD4 cell count less frequently (e.g., every 6 months to 12 months) in children and adolescents who are adherent to therapy, who have CD4 cell count values well above the threshold for OI risk, and wh o have had sustained virologic suppression and stable clinical status for >2 years to 3 years. Some clinicians find value in scheduling visits every 3 months even when lab testing is not performed, in order to review adherence and update drug doses for interim growth Additionally, Sample Schedule for Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring of Children Before and After Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy indicates viral load tests should be performed at entry into care; pre -therapy; ART initiation; weeks two to four on therapy, every three to four months to monitor ART adherence; and when switching ART regimens.
