I would like to contribute No, vitamin C cannot slow or stop the spread of the coronavirus If Your Time is short - The claim was originally shared on an alternative medical website that promotes nutritional supplementation. - There's currently no vaccine or medicine recommended to treat the current coronavirus, and there's no evidence high doses of vitamin C has any effect.

The most recent alleged miracle cure? Vitamin C. A [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/themegavitaminman/photos/a.154722701400928/1234263616780159/?type=3&theater) by \" [Megavitamin Man](https://andrewsaul.com/),\" states: \"The coronavirus pandemic can be dramatically slowed, or stopped completely, with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about [ our partnership with Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related).) While vitamin C may slightly help ward off common illnesses, there is no evidence high doses of the supplement can slow or stop the current coronavirus. The story appears to have originated with a [press release](http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n04.shtml?fbclid=IwAR1StVh4RB1eLlS1Iyu2vKRkcxX1AKkwzoiHE9pQy8xtfbDOI7KBFXi_ZjU) that Saul wrote for a website called Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, of which Saul is listed as an editor. (Orthomolecular medicine is a form of alternative medicine that aims to maintain human health through nutritional supplementation.) Featured Fact-check Despite the blog's lengthy claims about the powers of vitamin C, there's no credible evidence that a high intake of it will have any impact on the virus. [Health](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/preparing-international-travelers/complementary-and-integrative-health-approaches) [professionals](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/preparing-international-travelers/complementary-and-integrative-health-approaches) have even said the mineral has a marginal effect on the common cold. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html) and [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) both state that there's currently no vaccine or specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus. (WHO also [has a page](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters) dedicated to some of the most common coronavirus myths.) The organizations say the best way to prevent the illness is to avoid being exposed. Everyday preventive measures that are recommended include: avoiding close contact with people who are sick, covering your cough or sneeze, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, washing your hands thoroughly and often, and staying home when you are sick. A Facebook post says that taking high doses of vitamin C will slow or even stop the coronavirus. There's no evidence that the supplement has any effect on the coronavirus. There is currently no vaccine or medicine recommended for the virus. We rate this False.
