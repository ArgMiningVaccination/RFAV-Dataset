Skipping mea ls and severe caloric restrict ion only lower metabolic rate which can lead to weight gain (Eating breakfast actually jumpstarts your metabolism for the day.) Metabolic rate naturally peaks at noon and slows after that, so the food you eat at night is more likely to be stored as fat. If you cup your hands in front of you that is how big your stomach capacity is. Limit your intake to no more than that at each meal and snack. Smaller more frequent meals containing protein will normalize insulin secretion and limit fat being stored as fat instead of burned energy. When the liver, fat, and ovaries metabolize estrogen they use the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, which a diet rich in protein can rev up metabolizing estrogen more effectively. A snack around 4:00 p.m. (protein or unprocessed fat), when blood sugar, mood, and serotoni n tend to drop, can keep you from overeating at night. Cut down on refined and high glycemic index carbohydrates. \u00b7 This includes alcohol which is nothing but sugar in a form that is so absorbable its effects are felt in the brain in minutes. Alcohol also interferes with estrogen metabolism and causes almost an immediate hormone imba lance, increasi ng estrogen in the blood relative to progesterone. Carbohydrate sensitive individual s may find that eating whole grain products (whole wheat, whole rye, whol e oat, millet flour) triggers binge eating, so consume grains with caution. Eat at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetab les per day (1 serv ing = 4 ounces or 1/2 cup) remember the healthiest are the most colorful and highest in antioxidants, especially blueberries. L-glutamine 1 gram per day with lunch can help with sugar crav ings as can artificial sweeteners like Stev ia and Acesulfame. Water helps the body eliminate the breakdown products of fat (other options iced tea, decaf green tea, diluted fruit juices). Eat healthy fats. . Essential fatty acids (EFAs), name ly omega -3 and omega -6 fats, are needed to assist the body in many important functions, including those of the brain and nervous system. Good sources of EFAs include eggs, high-quality flax seeds, soybeans, walnuts; and cold water fish harvested from the wild. Again, the best way to obtain nutrients is in your food, but if your diet is lacking, high quality EFA supplements are widely available. Avoid trans -fats and partially hydrogenated fats and oils that are not found in nature and are pro-inflammatory. Recommend ratio of Omega 6/0mega 3 (2:1-4:1) Rev up your metabolic fat and carb burners. Fat eaten with low glycem ic index carbs or no carbs will not cause insulin to be secreted so it will not be stored as fat unless your body is overproduci ng insulin as a result of stress or an excess of food. Fatty acids cannot get into the mitochondrial furnace without L-carnitine (500 -2000 mg/day) which also prevents toxic fatty acid metabolites from building up in the heart. Some individuals do not make enough L-carnitine to burn their fat effectively. Chromium helps make insulin receptors more sensitive, helping burn carbs more effectively 200-400mcg/day.
