Symptoms can also include an urgent need to pass stoo l and occasional incontinence, with significant impact on the patient's quality of life. This clinical pathway focuses only on the investigation and management of chronic diarrhea. o Acute diarrhea is defined as 30 days or less. In Canada, a cute diarrhea is most often infectious and often requires only self-limited symptom management . Chronic diarrhea is common gastrointestinal disorder, affecting approximately 3-5% of the general population.1 Chronic diarrhea is more common among women than men and those with a body mass index > 30. Challenges may exist distinguishing between chronic diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome diarrhea- predominant (IBS-D) as there is overlap in symptoms . o Pathogenic mechanisms of chronic diarrhea may be common to that of IBS, including underlying motility disruption . o Chronic diarrhea is distinct from IBS-D as it occurs ch aracteristically in the absence of abdominal pain, thus visceral hypersensitivity is less of a feature. Checklist to guide in -clinic review of your patient with Chronic Diarrhea Confirm a bsence of alarm features (see algorithm Box 2). If alarm features identified, refer for specialist consultation. Assess Rome IV criteria for IBS - recurrent abdominal pain > 1 day per week in the last three month s related to defecation or associated wi th change of frequency and/or form (appearance) in stool. If present, refer to the IBS pathway . Complete baseline investigations confirming no abnormal results (CBC, electrolytes, ferritin, celiac disease screen , and C.d ifficile and ova and parasites ). Address other causes of diarrhea - medical conditions, culprit medications (se e Table 1), alternative diagnoses, and dietary triggers. EXPANDED DETAILS 1. Suspect ed chronic diarrhea A careful history will provide significant insight into the etiology of chronic diarrhea. There are two main categories to consider: Functional causes o Functional diarrhea without abdominal pain, not associated with inflammation or alteration to the gastrointestinal tract. It is distinct from IBS-D and post -infectious IBS, which is classically associated with pain/abdominal discomfort . 1 Scallan, E., Majowicz, S. E., Hall, G., Banerjee, A., Bowman, C. L., Daly, L., ... & Angulo, F. J. (2005). Prevalence of diarrhea in the community in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United States. International journal of epidemiology , 34(2), 454- 460. This primary care pathway was co -developed by primary and specialty care and includes input from multidisciplinary teams. It is intended to be used in conjunction with specialty advice services, when required, to support care within the medical home. Wide a doption of primary care pathways can facilitate timely, evidence-based support to physicians and their teams who care for patients with common low -risk GI conditions and improve appropriate access to specialty care, when needed. To learn more about primary care pathways, check out this short video . Last Updated: June 2023 Page 3 of 15 Back to Algorithm Organic causes o Irritable bowel disease (I BD), celiac disease, microscopic colitis, medication -induced diarrhea, bile acid induced diarrhea (BAD), or other rare causes of diarrhea (e.g., radiation induced) . Chronic diarrhea can also be described as one of, or a combination of , the following pathophysiologic processes: Watery Diarrhea: o Osmotic The amount of water present in the stool is dependent upon the presence of solutes/effective osmoles ( e.g., lactose, fructose). The presence of poorly absorbed solutes ( e.g., maldigested sugars) in the bowel inhibit normal water and electrolyte absorption and may lead to diarrhea (presence of higher water content in the stool). Some laxatives ( e.g., lactulose, citrate ( e.g., lactose, sorbitol, and fructose) may not be well absorbed, leading to osmotic diarrhea. When the solute is removed (excluded from the diet), the diarrhea typically resolves. o Secretory Caused by excessive electrolyte secretions in the colon, leading to increased fluid. One characteristic feature is the persistence of secretion during fasting/removal of food. Medications ( e.g., antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors (P PIs)), poorly reabsorbed bile a cids or fatty acids in the colon, and microscopic colitis are possible causes ; and rarely , hormone-producing tumors , excessive prostaglandin production, and other intestinal diseases ( e.g., IBD and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)). Inflammatory Diarrhea o The presence of blood and mucous in the stool can occur from inflammation and this may be immune- mediated. This occurs with chronic conditions , including IBD and other r are chronic infections ( e.g., amoebiasis, tuberculosis ( TB)). o Mucous can be a normal presence in stool and does not necessarily reflect inflammation. The key difference is the presence of blood. This is a red flag and necessitates referral. Overflow Diarrhea o A history of antecedent chronic constipation, particularly in the elderly, necessitates consideration of overflow diarrhea as a source of new onset/ poorly controlled watery stools in this context. o Plain x -ray imaging of the abdomen to identify fecal loadi ng may be helpful to direct management (see Chronic Constipation p athway ). Additional history : Medication review o Many medications can cause chronic diarrhea, including over the counter medications (see Table 1). Travel history and associated illness (gastroenteritis) o IBS associated with prior short -term, self-limited gastroenteritis i s common and can lead to longer - term altered bowel habit (post -infectious changes or IBS) . This can occur in conjunction with pain (see IBS pathway ). Personal or significant family history of immune -mediated disease (e.g., thyroid disease, IBD , or celiac disease) . Diet o A dietary review can be helpful to identify easily avoidable contributing factors , such as excessive caffeine, dairy products ( e.g., high lactose foods , like milk and ice cream ), sugar sweetened beverages, gluten/wheat, etc. Last Updated: June 2023 Page 4 of 15 Back to Algorithm 2. Alarm features If any of the following alarm featur es are identified, refer for consultation/endoscopy . Include any and all identified alarm features in the referral to ensure appropriate triage. Family history (first-degree relative) of IBD or colorectal cancer Onset of symptoms after age 50 Unintended weight loss (> 5% over 6-12 months) Nocturnal symptoms or significant incontinence Visible blood in stool (see High Risk Rectal Bleeding Pathway and/or Iron Deficiency Anemia Pathway ) Iron deficiency anemia (see Iron Prime r) Although alarm features are important to recognize, they have not been shown to be highly predictive of colon cancer. 3. Baseline investigations Blood o CBC, electrolytes, ferritin o C Reactive Protein ( CRP ): a non-specific marker of inflammation with modest accuracy for detecting inflammation . The sensitivity or false negative rate is approximately 70- 75% with limitations as non -specific . If elevated, it can be helpful, but if normal, does not definitively exclude an inflammatory condition . A very low CRP value is, however, reassuring.2 o Celiac disease screen: a highly accurate (sensitivity is ~95%) antibody screen for this immune- mediated condition . Ensure diet is gluten inclusive for at l east two weeks prior to testing to ensure no false negatives . Stool o C. difficile , stool for ova and parasites o In Alberta , the most common parasites are Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Entamoeba histolytica, but others may be indicated if there has been travel history . If there is a relevant travel history or other relevant factors , provide this information in the details of the ova and parasites requisition. o Note: Tests such as stool leukocytes and fat globules are generally not recommended. F ecal immunochemical testing (FIT) has NOT been validated for investigation of chronic diarrhea -like symptoms. O rdering FIT in this circumstance is inappropriate given the presence of symptoms . o Further investigation using f ecal calprotectin - consider ordering a fecal calprotectin if there is a high clinical suspicion of inflammation . o Fecal calprotectin is a stool -based test used to detect a protein released into the gastrointestinal tract from inflammatory cells (neutrophils) when present. Fecal calprotectin may be elevated and useful when there is a high clinical suspicion of IBD. o Elevated levels of fecal calprotectin are found in inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis). However, mid-range levels can also be found in several benign conditions, such as in patients on NSAIDs or PPIs or those with GI infections, celiac disease, and microscopic colitis (see Microscopic Colitis Primer ). By contrast, in functional disorders such as IBS, fecal calprotectin levels are normal.3 FCP methods are not standardized, so numerical FCP results tested by DynaLIFE should NOT be compared to previous FCP results from the referral laboratory. Indication for testing Result Interpretive Guidance <50 \u00b5g/g Normal (no detectable inflammation). 2 Menees, S. B., Powell, C., Kurlander, J., Goel, A., & Chey, W. D. (2015).

Monitoring of known IBD patients >250 \u00b5g/g Result suggests active inflammation. *For Patient <4 years of age High levels of fecal calprotectin are commonly observed in pediatric patients less than 4 years of age. Robust pediatric reference intervals have not been established for this age group. 4. Optimize management of secondary causes A detailed medical history and physical examination should be performed at presentation to assess for a multitude of other conditions that mimic functional diarrhea. A careful review of medications should be performed to identify ones that may be causing GI side effects. Some common medications include PPIs, acetylsalicylic acid ( age nts, anti -hypertensives , and herbal products (see Table 1). o Optimization of underlying medical conditions, including diabetes and thyroid disorders o Discontinue use or reduce dosage of culprit medications Ask about a history of cholecystectomy and whether this coincided with onset or worsening of symptoms. Post-cholecystectomy diarrhea, due to BAD, can be treated with cholestyramine. Ask about a history of bariatric surgery and whether this coincided with onset or worsening of symptoms. Ask about history of COVID -19 infection. Assess common dietary triggers - excessive intake of sugar sweetened beverages, juice, alcohol, caffeine (e.g., coffee, tea), artificial sweetener (e.g., sorbitol , diet pop), dairy ( e.g., high lactose content in milk and ice cream ), and gluten /wheat.

General p rinciples for treatment and management of c hronic diarrhea Patients with functional bowel disorders will benefit from lifestyle and dietary modifications. These simple modifications may be all that is required in those with mild or intermittent symptoms where quality of life is not significantly impacted. Connecting patients with resources for diet, exercise, stress reduction, and psychological counseling , where available, may be helpful . Initial assessment should include screening for underlying sleep and/or mood disorders. Patients with mental health issues such a s depression and anxiety may have refractory symptoms unless mental health issues are addressed. Treatment options (non-pharmacological ) Education on normal stool form and bowel movement frequency Details on variable frequency and form that is part of a normal spectrum of bowel habit. There is marked variation in what is considered a normal bowel habit. In a study of health y individuals , stool f requency varied from a low of 3 to a high of 21 bowel movements per week as being in the normal range . 4 Similarly , there is some normal variation in stool consistency as measured by the Bristol Stool Chart . If stool habit changes substantially , and persists , further investigations may be needed. Patient reassurance and management of expectations A key to long- term, effective management is to provide patients reassurance after their initial diagnosis and offer points of reassessment and reappraisal to establish a therapeutic relationship. Reassessment is recommended if there is a significant increase in diarrhea or signs and symptoms of dehydration. Modify diet, remove trigger foods, and space small meals throughout the day Referral to a dietitian can be helpful. Eat smaller meals spaced over the day to reduce gastric load. Diets high in lactose, fructose, sugar sweetened beverages and juices, diet beverages, sugar free gum, sorbitol, caffeine, and gluten/wheat can increase symptoms . Water is the best choice for hydration. Assess common food triggers. Follow a systematic approach of removing triggers and assessing symptoms before permanent elimination. It may be helpful for patients to use the Bowel and Symptom Journal to understand their symptoms, food triggers, and stressors. Use the diary to determine how dietary modifications, psychological, and pharmacological therapies impact thei r symptoms. 4 Mitsuhashi, S., Ballou, S., Jiang, Z. G., Hirsch, W., Nee, J., Iturrino, J., ... & Lembo, A. (2018). Characterizing norm al bowel frequency and consistency in a representative sample of adults in the United States (NHANES). American Journal of Gastroenterology , 113(1), 115- 123. Last Updated: June 2023 Page 7 of 15 Back to Algorithm Fibre and fluids Total fibre: Adults are recommended to consume 14 g/1000 kcal of fibre per day. Suggest about 21-38 g/day for most adults. Two types of fibre: o Insoluble fibre is found in wheat bran, the skin of fruits , and many raw vegetables. It adds bulk to the stool and contributes greatly to daily total fibre requirements . It may not add therapeutic health benefits like soluble fibre. o Soluble fibre is found in psyllium, oats, barley, fruit, and seeds. It absorbs water in the intestine to form a viscous gel that thickens the stool and stimulates peristalsis. o There is a dose-response relationship between fibre plus fluid intake and stool output. This is important to quantify, as patients whose fibre and fluid intake is inadequate are most likely to benefit from this intervention. Fibre acts as a sponge, so it is important to combine fluid and fibre. Increased fluid intake on its own will only result in increased urination. Soluble fibre supplementation: o May provide symptom relief for patients with IBD, IBS, constipation, and diarrhea. The therapeutic goal is 5-10 g/day of soluble fibre from foods and supplements including: 1 tbsp. psyllium husk or powder supplement - 3.0 grams 2 tbsp. ground flaxseed - 1.8 grams \u00bd cup kidney beans - 2.8 grams 1 pear - 2.2 grams Fibre and fluids cont'd General care: o Increasing fibre intake may result in negative side- effects that can be minimized or avoided. Slowly increase fibre to prevent gas, abdominal pain, and bloating. Start with a third of a dose and determine tolerance. Drink additional fluid (water) to compliment a high fibre diet. Inadequate fluid may lead to constipation, hardening of stool, bloating, and abdominal pain. Caution soluble fibre intake for people with or at risk of a bowel obstruction or narrowing of the esophagus, stomach, or intestine. Fibre supplements may reduce or delay absorption of certain medications . o See Patient Resourc es section for more information on fibre supplementation. Ensure adequate fluids: 2 L/day for females, 3 L/day for males Physical activity 20+ minutes of physical activity/day , aiming for 150 min/week is known to be an effective strategy for stress reduction. See the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines . Psychological therapy Cognitive -Behavioral Therapy and hypnotherapy may help with stress management and gastrointestinal symptoms.5 It is r ecommended that therapy be provided by a regulated health professional such as a registered psychologist. Screening for , and treating , any underlying sleep or mood disorders may be important. 6. Pharmacological options for treating chronic diarrhea Treatment options (pharmacological ) The use of pharmaceuticals in functional bowel disorders is generally reserved for those who have not adequately responded to dietary and lifestyle interventions, or in those with moderate or severe symptoms that impair quality of life. 5 Dyna Med Plus.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . https://www -dynamed- com.ahs.idm.oclc.org/ Last Updated: June 2023 15 Back to Algorithm Loperamide (Imodium\u00ae) Evidence: Effective fo r improved diarrheal symptoms but has not been shown to consistently improve IBS-D symptoms. Mechanism of action : Through \u00b5 (mu) opioid receptor agonis t, thus decreasing GI motility. Place in therapy: Effective antidiarrheal for prophylaxis for social situations or travel, however, should not be prescribed for continuous use. Adverse effects: Sedation, nausea, abdominal cramps.6 Lowest addiction potential of all opioids. Dose : 4 mg initially, followed by 2 mg after each loose bowel movement. Max 16 mg/day. Clinical improvement usually seen within 48 hours, if no clinical improvement after at least 10 days on maximum dose, symptoms unlikely to be controlled by further administration.7 Diphenoxylate - Atropine (Lomotil\u00ae) Evidence: Adjunctive therapy in management of moderate to severe diarrhea. Mechanism of action: Through \u00b5 (mu) opioid receptor agonist, thus decreasing GI motility. Atropine is an anticholinergic that further dec reases GI motility and discourages abuse. Place in therapy: Less effective than loperamide but may be used for intermittent symptoms for some patients. Adverse effects : Sedation, nausea, abdominal cramps, dry skin, and mucous membranes (from atropine) . Some addiction potential .5 Diphenoxylate - Atropine (Lomotil\u00ae) cont'd Dose : 5 mg PO initially , then 2.5 mg PO after each loose bowel movement. Max 20 mg/day. The e lderly are more susceptible to anticholinergic effects . Avoid concomitant use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors this may precipitate hypertensive crisis. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) Evidence: The most studied antidepressant class for treatment of abdominal pain.8 Mechanism of action : Suggested to be beyond serotonin and norepinephrine, and because of blocking voltage-gated ion channels, opioid receptor activation and potential neuro- immunologic anti-inflammatory effects.9 Their anticholinergic properties also slow GI transit time. Place in therapy: Recommended for overall symptom improvement in patie nts with IBS, as well as sleep issues, anxiety, or depression. Adverse effects: Anticholinergic and antihistaminic (drowsiness/insomnia, xerostomia, palpitations, weight gain, constipation, urinary retention) .9 Use with caution in patients at risk of prolonged QT. It can take 2 -3 months to reach maximum effect. The lowest effective dose should be used. Reassess therapy after 6-12 months. Dose should be gradually reduced if discontinuing. Recommended Medications Nortriptyline - 10-25 mg qhs. Increase dose by 10- 25 mg every 3- 4 weeks (due to delayed onset). May require 25-75 mg/day . Often takes 2-3 months for peak effect. ($20-60/month). Amitriptyline - 10-25 mg qhs. Increase dose by 10- 25 mg every 3- 4 weeks (due to delayed onset). May require 25-75 mg/day . Often takes 2-3 months for peak effect. ($15-20/month). Desipramine - 25 mg qhs, increase based on response and tolerability. Doses up to 150 mg daily have been evaluated for IBS (~$25/month). 6 DynaMed. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).

May result in significant clinical improvement in approximately 25% of people. Binds and removes bile acids in the intestine. Mechanism of action : Through the formation of a non-absorbable complex with bile acids in the intestine. Place in therapy: Use gradual daily dose titration to minimize adverse effects and use at the lowest dose needed to minimize symptoms for BAD .5 Adverse effects: Nausea, fat -soluble vitamin deficiency with long- term use, constipation. Take other medications 1 hour before or 4- 6 hours after. Dose: A 2-4-week titration trial is reasonable to see effects. Intermittent, on -demand use may also be trialed. Relief usually occurs within 3 days of initiation of therapy . If no relief occurs , alternative therapy should be initiated.5 Recommended Medications Cholestyramine resin - 4 g PO Q12H, take with fluids. ($30/month). Pouch can be divided into a smaller dose and mixed with water or juice (tomato or orange juice) starting at 2-4 g once /day, titrating to effect. Colestipol (Colestid\u00ae) or Colesevelam (Lodalis\u00ae) available as tablets if patient is unable to tolerate powder. Second line therapies Consider consulting a GI using Specialist Link, Connect MD, or e-Referral Advice Request for guidance on these treatments. Rifaximin (Zaxine\u00ae) A non- systemically absorbed antibiotic. Mechanism of action : Not clearly identified, but may alter the microbiome, thus reducing gas production. Dose: 550 mg 3x/daily for 2 weeks. This is a safe medication but tends to require multiple recurrent courses. There is no long-term safety or efficacy data over 3 courses . (~$325 month, not covered by public insurers) . 7. Consider alternative diagnoses Microscopic Colitis (see Microscopic Colitis Primer ) Irritable Bowel Syndrome -diarrhea predominant (IBS -D) IBS is a brain -gut disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain/discomfort and altered bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea, or both). It is often associated with bloating or abdominal distention. These key symptoms can vary in severity and tend to remit and recur, often affected by dietary exposures and stress. For patients with suspected IBS -D, the Rome IV diagnostic criteria may provide a guide. Recurrent abdominal pain , on average, 1 day per week in the last 3 months, associated with 2 of the following criteria where pain is: o R elated to defecation o Associated with a change in frequency of stool o Associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool o C riteria fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis. If the patient assessment identifies predominant symptoms of pain and/or bloating, refer to the IBS pathway . Bile acid induced diarrhea (BAD) Bile acids produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder are normally secreted into the small bowel in response to a meal , and then reabsorbed in the distal ileum (also known as enterohepatic ineffective ileal acid malabsorption/ bile acid diarrhea or Last Updated: June 2023 Page 10 of 15 Back to Algorithm BAM/BAD) can dysregula te this p rocess . Subsequent u nabsorbed bile acids stimulate sodium and water secretion in the colon, increase motility , and stimulate defecation, thereby contributing to chronic diarrhea.10 There are several subtypes: o Idiopathic: contributing to 25-35% of patients with chronic diarrhea-predominant IBS -D or chronic functional diarrhea o Post-cholecystectomy o Other : secondary to small bowel resection (Crohn's disease) or radiation therapy affecting the ileum Diagnosis and treatment : Diagnosis may be challenging . Giving a n empiric trial of bile acid seques trants is reasonable, easy, and inexpensive. See Treatment options - Bile acid sequestrants . Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) Unlike the colon, a significant number of bacteria do not normally reside in the small bowel. Sm all intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a condition where dysbiosis or increased bacteria are present proximal to the ileocecal valve and within the small bowel where there is normally l ess bacteria. SIBO is a rare caus e of gastrointestinal symptoms. SIBO should only be considered in patients who have:11 o Severe diabetic neuropathy o Advanced scleroderma o Anatomic alterations such as surgery for Crohn's disease, Crohn's strictures, and/or radiation o Immune deficiency ( e.g., commo n variable immunodeficiency) o Note: The accuracy of the breath test for SIBO is highly variable and may be unreliable. Routine testing for SIBO is not currently recommended.12,13 o The use of hydrogen breath testing has been used in the past to make a diagnosis of SIBO. However, the accuracy is not consistent, therefore; should not be ordered in primary care. Empiric antibiotic treatment for SIBO should only be considered for symptomatic patients with at least one of the above considered risk factors. See Second line therapies - Rifaximin . Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) The normal functioning pancreas produces enzymes responsible for facilitating macronutrient digestion (enzymatic cleavage) so absorption can occur. Pancreatic insufficiency is not a common cause of chronic diarrhea but may be a contributing component in the context of known pancreatic disease (e.g., chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, or prior surgical resection of the small bowel or stomach). If you suspect pancreatic insufficiency in someone with pancreatic disease, consider testing stool for fecal elastase (low levels suggest pancreatic insufficiency). Routine use of pancreatic enzymes to support digestion are not supported by evidence and are costly . 8.

Provide as much information as possible on the referral form, including identified alarm feature(s), important findings, and treatment/management strategies trialed with the patient. Still concerned about your patient? The primary care physician is typically the provider who is most familiar with their patient's overall health and k nows how they tend to present. Changes in normal patterns, or onset of new or worrisome symptoms , may raise suspicion for a potentially serious diagnosis , even when investigations are normal and typical alarm features are not present. There is evidence to support the importance of the family physician's intuition or \"gut feeling\" about patient symptoms, especially when the family physician is worried about a sinister cause such as cancer. A meta-analysis examining the predictive value of gut feelings showed that the odds of a patient being diagnosed with cancer, if a GP recorded a gut feeling, were 4.24 times higher than when no gut feeling was recorded. 14 When a \"gut feeling\" persists despite normal investigations, and you decide to refer your patient for specialist consultation, document your concerns on the referral with as much detail as possible. Another option is to seek specialist advice ( see Advice Options ) to convey your concerns. PRIMERS Iron Primer Evaluation of measures of iron storage can be challenging. Gastrointestinal (occult) blood loss is a common cause of iron deficiency and should be considered as a cause when iron deficiency anemia is present. Menstrual loss es should also be considered. There are t wo serological tests to best evaluate iron stores (ferritin, transferrin saturation) - neither of which are perfect . The first step is to evaluate ferritin : If the ferritin is below the lower limit of normal (lower limit of normal is 30 \u00b5g/L for men and 20 \u00b5g/L for women), it is diagnostic of iron deficiency with high specificity (98% specificity). Ferritin is an acute phase reactant which may be elevated in the context of acute inflammation and infection . If ferritin is normal or increased, and you suspect it may be acting as an acute phase reactant, order a trans ferrin saturation test (see below). o However, if the ferritin is > 100 \u00b5g/L and there is no concurrent significant chronic renal insufficiency, iron deficiency is very unlikely - even in the context of acute inflammation/infection. The second step is to evaluate transferrin saturation : The transferrin saturation is a calculated rati o using serum iron and total iron binding capacity. Serum iron alone does not reflect iron stores. Low values (< 16%) demonstrate low iron stores in conjunction with a ferritin < 100 \u00b5 g/L. In the absence of abnormal iron indices, anemia may be from other c auses other than GI (occult) blood loss ( e.g., bone marrow sources, thalassemia, and sickle cell anemia). 14 Friedemann Smith, C., Drew, S., Ziebland, S., & Nicholson, B.

Last Updated: June 2023 Page 12 of 15 Back to Algorithm Microscopic Colitis Primer Microscopic colitis is a benign condition with a median age of onset in the mid-60s , more often in women than men. It is chara cterized by non -bloody, watery/ secretory diarrhea having significant potential impact on quality of life. Atypical presentations can also occur. Examination by colonoscopy reveals normal findings, inflammation is present o nly histologically (on biopsy). Medications have been implicated in the pathophysiology. Common offenders include NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), statins , topiramate, and SSRIs. Consideration should be given to stopping these medications , if possible. This condition is non- progressive, and therapy is directed to improving quality of life and stool habit regularity (< 3 stools per day, minimal water content). Treatment for microscopic colitis is similar to those used in the treatment of IBS. o Increased soluble fibre (psyllium, inulin) can be helpful to regular stool habit in addition to loperamide, as needed. o For more significant manifestations (defecation at night, incontinence) , corticosteroid therapy may be indicated ( e.g., budesonide/ Entocort\u00ae or Cortiment\u00ae (little to no evidence exists for prednisone). Total treatment duration ranges on response from 6- 8 weeks to 12 weeks. Last Updated: June 2023 Page 13 of 15 Back to Algorithm Provide Feedback BACKGROUND About this P athway Digestive health primary care pathways were originally developed in 2015 as part of the Calgary Zone's Specialist LINK initiative. They were co-developed by the Department of Gastroenterology and the Calgary Zone's specialty integration group, which includes medical leadership and staff from Calgary and area Primary Care Networks, the Department of Family Medicine, and Alberta Health Services. The pathways were intended provide evidence-based guidance to support primary care providers in caring for patients with common digestive health conditions within the medical home. Based on the successful adoption of the primary care pathways within the Calgary Zone, and their impact on timely access to quality care, in 2017 the Digestive Health Strategic Clinical Network led an initiative to validate the applicability of the pathways for Alberta and to spread availability and foster adoption of the pathways across the province. Authors & Conflict of Interest D eclaration This pathway was reviewed and revised under the auspices of the Digestive Health Strategic Clinical Network in 2021 , by a multi -disciplinary team led by family physicians and gastroenterologists. Names of participating reviewers and their conflict -of-interest declarations are available on request. Pathway Feedback and R eview Process Primary care pathways undergo scheduled review every three years, or earlier if there is a clinically significant change in knowledge or practice. The next scheduled review is May 2024; however, we welcome feedback at any time. Click on the Provide Feedback button to provide your feedback.
