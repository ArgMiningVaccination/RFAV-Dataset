Experience development focused sharply on you. Introducing the Antioch School. Traditional theological education institutions tend not to customize training to the unique gifts, abilities, and callings of each student. The Antioch School is different, placing a student's life and ministry development at the heart of its program. Using the System for Identifying Motivated Abilities (SIMA \u00ae), students receive individualized Motivated Abilities Patterns to help them and their mentors understand and respond to how God has \"hard-wired\" them, as well as tools for personal life development and assessment from the mentors that God has already put in place for them. The training is conducted in your church, by your church leaders, and for your church, church network, or ministry team--resulting in tested and reliable leaders for your church . www.bild.org/antiochschool.html | antiochschool@bild.org | 515.292.9694Degrees and Certicates Available: Bachelor of Ministry (B.Min.)

MORGAN Deputy Managing Editor EVENTY PERCENT of American men ages 18-34 view Internet pornography once a month. This shocking fact is one of many that CT consulting editor John W. Kennedy found during his research for this month's cover story, \"Help for the Sexually Desperate\" (page 28). Don't assume that porn isn't a problem in the church. One evangelical leader was skeptical of survey findings that said 50 percent of Christian men have looked at porn recently. So he surveyed his own congregation. He found that 60 percenthad done so within the past year, and 25 percent within the past 30 days. Othersurveys reveal that one in three visitors to adult websites are women. Porn is gaining a stranglehold on mainstream American culture. One reason is the false message that porn viewing is harmless and socially acceptable for thesexually frustrated. One reason it is notharmless is the number of casual porn viewers who end up sexually addicted. The term sexual addiction is only 25 years old. But it describes the very real problem of extreme sexual behavior that is destructive to self and others. In his research, John found that experts believetens of millions of people are addicted to sex. Stigma and fear work against Christians who wish to address this issue in the community of their church. John himself bears witness to this reality: He became motivated to write about sex addiction after his pastor stonewalled his request to start a confidential men's accountability group. The pastor basicallysaid this hot potato was too hot to handle. After much prayer, John decided tochange churches; he then contacted CTto begin writing this article. John's thorough reporting grants church leaders an unprecedented look into the way men's accountability groups function. One crucial element is creating a confidential context for full disclosure. John said, \"I'm a guy. And just abouteverybody has struggled with this at one time or another. But we don't talk about that at church usually.\" Disclosure of sex addiction or porn use is so stigmatizing that it is best handled in a confidential, small-group setting inwhich participants agree not to pass judgment. They also grant each other \"the right to call\" 24/7 for unannounced check-ins. \"The thing that struck me the most in talking with these men is that I found an honesty rarely apparent in the church,\" John told me. \"These guys are real. Theyare transparent, honest, no bull, no plastic smiles.\" Some of John's recommendations for starting a men's accountability group include starting small, extending the group's focus beyond sexuality only, andmaintaining its Christian purpose. This reminds me of how distinctive Christiancommunity is. \"Because Christian community is founded solely on Jesus Christ,it is a spiritual and not a psychic reality. In this it differs absolutely from allother communities.\" That comment from Dietrich Bonhoeffer perfectly sumsup what faithful, risk-taking congregations offer a sexually obsessed society.

The country has a rich heritage of Christianity,and God is waking people up to himself. As it happened in China after the revolution, I think the locals need to be encouraged andtrained to serve their own people. Theyknow the culture and the language. ManyTurkish media are anti-Christian, andTurkey needs prayer for change. God didand will change lives over there. It's hardto preach to Muslims, but thankfully the new media can do it. YILMAZ KAYA E-mail HAVING LIVED in Turkey as a Chris- tian worker for 12 years, and having seen some of these events firsthand, I commend Tony Carnes for his reporting.God's kingdom will be established inTurkey through the blood of the bravebelievers who stand for Christ there. Ourprayers are constantly with them. CLAUDIA WILLIAMS E-mail Jokesters for Jesus AS A CHRISTIAN comedian, I lean on LarkNews as a way to relax and loosen up [\"Laughing with Evangelicals,\"January]. Sometimes the church worlddoesn't get it, and that's fine. Our faith is sopersonal that sometimes we feel as ifeverything must fit perfectly in our per-sonal \"holy box.\" Joel Kilpatrick is one of many folks who remind us that it is some- times a breath of fresh air to enjoy the wit,creativity, and spirit of the Christian life. LONNIE SWONGER Nampa, Idaho Learning a New Dance IAM A WIDOW . Yes, the gaping wound left by a husband's death will eventually scab over; yes, life goes on [\"The Widow's Might,\" January]. In the first days and weeks, I was amazed at how many of thewomen I chatted with were widows them-selves. One doesn't carry a badge, but the grief is unmistakable. If one had no faith, it would surely be much worse. Looking back, after two and a half years, I think thedoor that was closed so abruptly hasallowed other doors to open. One must gothrough these other doors without fear. Wonderful are the words of C. S. Lewis in his little book A Grief Observed, in which he says that a marriage is like a dance. One has learned all the figures\u2014 now God takes the one, and the other hasto learn new figures for a new dance. Andwe must never forget that we are notalone, for his rod and staff comfort all of uswho walk through the valley of the shad-ow of death. Thank you for a great article. VIVIAN EVANS E-mail Shopping for God IAPPRECIATED Anglo-Catholic Episcopalianand ending up a Southern Baptist minister,while stopping along the way in Presbyter-ian, charismatic, and Methodist churches.Like Mouw, I believe my spiritual journeywas led by God into a deeper knowledgeand love of Christ. I am grateful now to bein a congregation that does not deprecate,but actually appreciates that experience. As always, we should distinguish between worldly church shopping to satis-fy some desire for thrills, and the genuinehunger for God that follows the Spirit'sleading to new environments of growth in the Lord. GARRETT WARD SHELDON Professor, University of Virginia's College at Wise Wise, Virginia IWAS INTRIGUED by Richard Mouw's article on the potential spiritual benefits of church shopping. He makes a very valid point about the need to allow spiritual growth and theological development toshape and even change decisions onchurch affiliation. However, in my experi- ence, those cases where new theological understandings dictate a church move arethe exception, not the rule. \"READERS WRITE CONTACTING CT Letters to the editor must include the writer's name and address if intended for publication.

Weneed to get away from the idea that thechurch exists for the benefit of the believ- er, and move back to the view that the church, and the believers involved, existfor the benefit of the world. Only wheneach believer sees his or her role as servingthrough, rather than consuming from, their local church will we truly understand Christ's original intention for his body. STEPHEN WILBURN West Chester, Pennsylvania RICHARD MOUW is an excellent scholar and leader who should not have ruminated publicly about con-sumerism. Consumerism in religion doesnot mean having options in religion (whichRodney Stark defends very well) that leadto the \"spiritually fulfilling Christian for-mation\" or \"profound personal renewal\"that Mouw writes of. Alternative methodsof spiritual growth are fine\u2014but that is notconsumerism. In its most blunt form, spiritual con- sumerism means that God's message isadjusted to suit the consumer, rather thandemanding that the person adjust his lifeto suit God and his Word. That's why the word marketing has as its direct antonym mission. A central biblical example of real con- sumerism is Aaron's response to the peo-ple when Moses delayed his descent from Mount Sinai. In today's terms, we mightsay that Aaron's new forms of worshipwere exactly \"what the people wanted\"and could understand. Moses was simply \"out of touch\" with the people while Aaron \"understood the times.\" The resulting pop-ularity with the crowds proved that Aaronwas right . . . until God spoke and the earthopened up. That is spiritual consumerism. JOHN TEEVAN Director of Prison Extension, Grace CollegeWinona Lake, Indiana Rosetta Stone.\u00ae The fastest and easiest way to learn .

I believe that the gospel is notjust for individual salvation but is some- thing that transforms society. And it doesseem more exciting and fresh to \"fightinjustice\" rather than to \"evangelize.\" Butthere must be both, for our God demands it. Let's not look only to the outside, but also look to people's hearts. Let that beour aim.

But in 18 years here, I have found that what our inner-city friends often want more thananything else (and need most of all) isBread and Water, one mouthful of which gives life forever. One comment, however, for Mr. Guthrie: As a college instructor in evangelism and a collector of \"evangelism\" definitions, I often wonder how \"repent of sin and follow Jesus,\" and similar gospel summaries, makefor Good News. These inner-city folks, justlike all other folks, have a hard time making \"Turn away from the only way I've ever learned, to obey someone whose right toask I don't understand,\" sound like \"a giftfrom God.\" LONJ. G REGG Spiritual Director, Denver Rescue Mission Denver, Colorado WHY DO evangelical Christians have to think about these issues only in black and white, either/or terms? It's both [evangelism and social action]. As apast Evangelism Explosion devotee, I taught, trained, and witnessed to over a hundred with the exciting E.E. presenta-tion. I love it. It is brilliantly simple and Iuse versions of it to this day. Yes, it bothers me that more Christians don't appear to be interested in sharingtheir faith. But it used to bother me thatevangelicals seemed to be the only reli- gious group in the world notmindful of social issues. That seems to be changing. Praise the Lord.

A RMSTRONG Professor of Evangelism, Wheaton College Graduate School Wheaton, Illinois Birth Rite PHILIP YANCEY 'Spiece on the Incarnation was a marvelous reminder of the balance we must strike in our contemplation of the work of Christ [\"Ongoing Incarnation,\" January]. Too often, as evangelicals, we tend to subvert Christ's birth (or his earthly ministry andeven his resurrection) to his death, makingthe former merely a necessary conditionfor the latter. The work of Christ, of course, cannot be limited to any one event in his life; along with Christ's ministry,along with his death and resurrection, wemust remember his birth. It was the cos-mic importance of this birth of which the Greek father of the church, Maximus the Confessor, spoke when he said that theunion \"between finitude and infinity . . .has been manifested in Christ at the end of time.\" Yancey, with his timely piece, reminds us of the long Christian history of speaking of the work of Christ in this way\u2014a much-needed message during the seasons of Advent and Christmas.

The nationwide Super Tuesday primaries may have tightened Sen. John McCain's hold onthe Republican presidential nomination. Buthis candidacy is exposing divides betweenevangelical voters and their spokesmen. And with surveys indicating that many evangelical voters remain undecided, experts say Democ-rats could make inroads, depending on whichcandidate the party eventually nominates. Evangelical Republicans divided their votes nearly evenly on Super Tuesdaybetween the top three candidates, accordingto exit polls. Former Arkansas GovernorMike Huckabee collected 34 percent, while former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Rom- ney earned 31 percent. McCain followedclosely with 29 percent. Huckabee, despite little support from con- servative leaders, won five Southern stateswith large numbers of evangelicals. Romney,the preferred candidate of many high-profileconservatives, could not top either Huckabeeor McCain in any Bible Belt state. \"Trying to pigeonhole evangelical voters by looking at a few leaders is probably a bigmistake,\" said John Green, senior fellow inreligion and American politics atthe Pew Forum on Religion& Public Life. Data about evangelicals and Democrats is sketchybecause exit polls did notask whether voters wereborn again. Yet a February4 survey from the BarnaGroup indicated agrowing openness among born-again Chris-tians toward a Democratic candidate. Barna's numbers also revealed a large swath of undecided voters. They won't turnto McCain, if Focus on the Family founderJames Dobson can help it. \"Should Sen. McCain capture the nomi- nation as many assume, I believe this gener-al election will offer the worst choices forPresident in my lifetime,\" Dobson said in amessage to his e-mail subscribers the morn-ing of Super Tuesday. \"I certainly can't votefor Hillary Barack Obama based ontheir virulently anti-family policy positions.If these are the nominees in November, Isimply will not cast a ballot for President for the first time in my life.\" Reaction to Dobson's comments was swift and fierce, especially as it becameapparent that McCain would be the bigwinner on Super Tuesday. \"Dr. Dobson should know that John McCain would certainly appoint better justices to the court than either Obama orClinton,\" said Michael Cromartie, vice pres-ident at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.\"Politics is about making choices between relative goods and lesser evils and not about having perfect choices. It's a wasted vote onDr. Dobson's part. It's irresponsible on hispart to give that kind of leadership.\" Should Obama earn the Democratic nomination, his message of hope and unitywill appeal to young evangelicals, said AllenHertzke, a political science professor at theUniversity of Oklahoma. Obama talks openlyabout his faith, often employing biblicalimagery in his speeches. But any outreacheffort from Clinton would need to overcomeher family's history. The successes of Huckabee and McCain show that evangelicals are open to a broaderpolicy agenda, Green said.

Observers and Christian leaders say India's largest incident of sustained anti- Christian violence, which rendered thousandshomeless in Orissa State, was preplanned. The violence began on Christmas Eve, with an attack on a Catholic church in Brah-mani village, and continued until January 2.Christian leaders told the National HumanRights Commission that 9 people had been killed, close to 90 churches burned, about 600 houses torched or vandalized, andthousands displaced. Three months before the series of attacks, a newspaper had warned that ten-sions were brewing between the Christianand non-Christian tribal communities overgovernmental affirmative-action benefits.During Christmas week, local Christians hadurged district authorities to provide police protection. Their pleas went unheeded. Christians make up an estimated 16 per- cent of the 650,000 people in Kandhamal dis- trict. More than 60 percent of them belong tothe Pana community and are classified as\"Scheduled Castes,\" better known as Dalits(formerly \"Untouchables\"). Their demand forrecognition as a tribal community is opposedby the largely Hindu Kui people, as it wouldincrease the number of candidates eligible forgovernment-reserved jobs. With elections due in 10 other states this year and a general election scheduled for2009, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Jana-ta Party ( BJP) plans to use religion-related issues to polarize voters. This tactic, Chris-tians fear, could increase the incidence ofanti-Christian violence. The Orissa State government transferred both the district collector and the policesuperintendent for failing to prevent theviolence. Orissa's population of 36 millionincludes fewer than 900,000 Christians.

Would he put the hood on and pull the lever? I don't think so.\" The numbers may support Whitehead's theory. Only 55 percent of Americans ages 18-29 support the death penalty, according to David Masci of the Pew Forum on Reli-gion & Public Life. But Masci isn't ready tocall it a trend. \"I don't think we can tell,\" hesaid. The live-and-let-live attitude of youthmay change as they get older, he said. Masci said support for capital punish- ment has fluctuated during the past half-century. Briefly, during the 1960s, moreAmericans opposed executions than sup-ported them. But the next three decades saw a steady rise in support, with approval peaking in the 1990s. \"Obviously, we can't know for sure what exactly drove public opinion, but it certainlytracks well with an increase in the crimerates during those years,\" Masci said. Ascrime rates began to fall in the '90s, so didsupport for executions. Support or opposition to the death penal- ty doesn't seem tightly tied to the teachings of the church, Masci said. While most main- line Protestant churches and the RomanCatholic Church oppose the death penalty,their members aren't far behind evangelicalsin support of it. Furthermore, NationalChris- tianPoll.com found that just 60 percent of active Christians who support capital pun-ishment say they do so because of biblicalteaching. (Its power as a deterrent to futurecrimes ranked nearly as high, at 59 percent.) The divide is seen most clearly along racial lines. According to the Pew Forumpoll, black Protestants oppose the deathpenalty by 51 percent. While African Ameri-cans made up 13 percent of the populationin 2006, they constituted nearly 42 percentof death row inmates. \"My sense is that historical depth and thinking through the principles of moraldecisions about this matter isn't done,\" said James Skillen, president of the Center for Converted Tony Blair, former prime minister of the United Kingdom, to RomanCatholicism.

While the issue before the Supreme Court is narrow, thenational mood on capital punish-ment itself seems to be shifting.New Jersey became the 14th state to outlaw executions in December 2007 . And a Pew Forum poll takenlast August found that public support for capital punishmenthas dropped to 62 percent from ahigh of 80 percent in 1994.

Sarah Eekhoff Zylstra [INTERFAITH DIALOGUE] Foreign Correspondence Muslim and Christian leaders seek common ground in conciliatory letters. An open-letter exchange between Muslim and Christian leaders has prompted bothpraise and criticism from evangelicals. In October, 138 Muslim scholars and clerics representing the major branches of Islam released \"A Common Word Between Us and You,\" a document inviting Christiansto interfaith dialogue on behalf of peace. Inresponse, scholars at Yale Divinity School'sCenter for Faith and Culture drafted \"Lov-ing God and Neighbor Together,\" which wassigned by nearly 300 Christian leaders andpublished in a December edition of The NewY ork Times. \"We have to start somewhere, and at least opening the door is a critical first step,\"said Scott Moreau, a Wheaton College mis-sion professor, who did not sign the letter.But critics say the Yale letter will do moreharm than good. Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, faulted theletter for lacking specificity on core Christ-ian teachings such as the Trinity and Jesus'divinity. He also criticized a section that hebelieves constitutes an unwarranted apologyfor the Crusades. \"My biggest problem with the document is theological,\" said Mohler. \"[It] is ratherevasive about crucial Christian truth claims.I am eagerly ready for peaceful conversationwhich the Muslim clerics have called for, but I do not believe that letter is the best Christian response.\" Patrick Sookhdeo, director of the Institute for the Study of Islam and Christianity andinternational director of the Barnabas Fund,has written his own response to \"A CommonWord.\" His response analyzes the Qur'anicQuotationMarks verses quoted in the Muslim letter by examin-ing their contexts and their hadith and tafsir interpretations, which are well known toMuslims and generally more aggressive toChristians than the Qur'an itself. \"I don't believe one can take 'A Common Word' at face value,\" said Sookhdeo, a Mus-lim convert to Christianity. \"It is a veiledthreat calling for the acceptance of Islamicdominance.\" However, C HRISTIANITY TODAY editor in chief David Neff, who signed the Yale letter,said the document fulfills its narrow goal ofpeacemaking. \"[F]undamental theologicaldifferences were not on the table for discus- sion in these letters,\" Neff said. \"The point of the letter was to say we appreciate youputting the olive branch out there, and we'reeager to talk with you.\" Judith Mendelsohn Rood, associate pro- fessor of history and Middle Eastern studiesat Biola University, said she felt no hesitationin signing the document. \"Christians arebeing hit for writing a letter that apologizesto Muslims,\" she said. \"But isn't that the core of our faith, to acknowledge our own sin? Many things have been said and done in thename of Christ that have been incrediblydamaging over the centuries.\" Richard Cizik, the National Association of Evangelicals' vice president for governmen-tal affairs, acknowledged that the letter isn'tperfect. Yet he signed it because he believesreconciliation is needed in international rela-tions, he said. \"Right now, our national image is lowest in the Muslim world, in part because it perceives that American evangeli-cals want to make war with it. That's notwhat evangelicalism either wants or needs.Reconciliation means building a commonvision about our world; this can't be doneapart from a process of dialogue.\" Miroslav Volf, a principal drafter of the letter, said workshops and events for inter-faith dialogue are already growing out of theMuslim-Christian exchange.

In the lawsuit,Parkinson-Webb alleged that the schoolknew her former husband had an affairwith a student, but failed to dismiss him.Webb, who later left the school, told CThe'd never had an affair. \"In my experience, there has been a pat- tern of harassment and retaliation that [theschool] wouldn't want exposed,\" Parkinson- Webb said. \"A lot of this is very painful, but I'm hoping it will do good for others whocome after me.\" As part of the judgment, Mars Hill must provide Parkinson-Webb with a letter ofregret and a letter of reference. The schoolmust also \"engage outside professionals toconduct diversity/anti-discrimination train-ing for all employees on at least an annualbasis for not less than three years.\" Mars Hill president Dan Allender said that Parkinson-Webb had not been harassedor fired, and that the school had agreed to ajudgment simply to avoid further litigationcosts. \"I don't know how to respond to suchconjectures and accusations,\" Allender said.\"This is a tragedy for us that personal prob-lems, in my view, have apparently been pro-jected onto our institution and community.\" However, a former adjunct professor whose husband also co-founded the school, Suzanne Hudson, said she faced a similar situation to Parkinson-Webb's in 2001.

Victims of Kenya's post-election violence are attempting to return to normal life, but Christian workers say woundscaused by the ongoing turbulence will takea long time to heal. More than 800 people were killed by roaming mobs during the first month of the conflict, and some250,000 were driven from their homes. \"The depth of the hatred that flared up . . . was a shock to many of us,\" said Ngari Kari-ithi, senior pastor of Karura CommunityChapel in northern Nairobi, a hosting site forhundreds of internally displaced Kenyans. The violence erupted after President Mwai Kibaki claimed victory on December27 in a disputed race against challenger RailaOdinga. Long-standing tribal rivalriesspurred Odinga's supporters, who felt cheat-ed by the electoral process. Fighting hasbeen worst in the western Rift ValleyProvince: Pro-Odinga tribes (Kalenjin,Luhya, Luo, and Pokot) have attacked Kiba-ki's tribe (Kikuyu), driving people from their homes with machetes and setting homes ablaze. Kikuyu have engaged in revengekillings, and police have also used violenceto quell protests, shooting demonstrators. The National Council of Churches of Kenya reported that four churches havebeen destroyed in the riots, including one in Eldoret, where 50 people were killed. \"We all fear the violence will be rekin- dled,\" said Bernard Terlouw, Kenya director of Mission Aviation Fellowship, shortly before Odinga-initiated protests sparked anew round of attacks. Nick Wasunna, World Vision's emergency adviser, said the humanitarian situation waslikely to get worse for refugees, many ofwhom are unable to meet basic needs andfear returning home. They have been congre-gating at schools, police stations, churches,and open fields where relief agencies have been delivering aid. \"The people are scared,\" said Wasunna. \"A lot of trust and hope hasbeen lost.\" The blame for some of that fear has been placed on Kenya's churches, which did little initially to stem the riots. \"I wantto be honest with you that thechurch at the very beginning hasbeen divided along ethnic lines,\"said a church leader in the Nyanza Province who asked that he not be named. \"At first, [church] leadersspoke like there was nothingwrong.

Terlouw said,\"The moral framework people [have] beenliving in has collapsed.\" Dennis Tongoi, Africa regional director of the Church Mission Society, said humani-tarian work must be followed by rebuildingand restoration, so that Kenyans can begin to\"restore trust and rebuild broken relation- ships.\" But many acknowledge that reconcil- iation will be a long and difficult road. \"You look at these children at the feed- ing centers with what has now becometheir only worldly possessions, and they'resitting in an open field just staring vacantlyinto the sky,\" said World Vision's Wasunna.\"This is the future generation of Kenya.Pray that love will heal the wounds the vio-lence has left behind.\" Sheryl Henderson Blunt, with reporting by Sue Sprenkle in Nairobi, Kenya [ISLAM] A Kinder , Gentler Shari'ah?

In a recent radio interview, Kengor detailed Clinton's Methodist upbringing, her public professions of faith, and her prayer life and involvementin Bible studies. The talk-show host, Robert Mangino, respond- ed in a way that epitomizes many evangelicals' reaction to Hillary: \"I know it sounds judgmental, but I just can't believeshe's a Christian. I think all of her talk of faith is pure politics.\" From all sides of the political spectrum, evangelicals respond with a surprising amount of disgustupon hearing Hillary's name. Clinton, like every big-name political figure, has admittedlysaid and done things that have polarized, offended, and simply gotten under our skin. Her publicpersona, a brand of East Coast lib-eralism with roots in '60s radicalpolitics, strikes many Americansas uppity and unapproachable.Open talk about her personal faithin recent years strikes some as politically convenient. And Clin- ton's consistently pro-choice stance onabortion clashes with most evangelicals' deeply held belief thatlife begins in the womb and should be protected at great cost. 'NO WAY IN HELLARY' But then come more baseless blows to the former first lady. Nosmall amount of jokes and hate-marketing attests to how far the\"Hate Hillary\" demographic stretches: T-shirts, bumper stick-ers, voodoo dolls, and \"No Way in Hellary\" BBQ aprons are now among the items you can purchase to advertise your anti-Hillary stance. On the nonprofit side, scads of websites dish onHillary's supposed crookery, while bloggers invent newderogatory nicknames, such as Hitlery and Hilldabeast. Weseem to simply enjoy hating Hillary. Some prominent conservative Christians, although toned down in their language, have nonetheless relied on cheap shotsto join in the fun. At a 2004 Republican convention, a FamilyResearch Council spokesman passed out fortune cookies withthe following message: #1 reason to ban human cloning: HillaryClinton. The late Jerry Falwell, though not noted for his tactfulpublic statements, announced at a 2006 Values Voter Summit his wishes for this year's election: \"I certainly hope that Hillary is the candidate. Because nothing would energize my [con-stituency] like Hillary Clinton. If Lucifer ran, he wouldn't.\" Perhaps Hillary-bashing says more about the political climate Americans have created than it does about Clinton herself. The current President? \"Village Idiot.\" The one before him? \"Slick Willy.\" And on it goes. Instead of researching a candidate's votingrecord or listening to position statements on pressing issues, it'seasier to mark someone ENEMY and begin the verbal whacking. There's admittedly something comforting about this: It helpsmake sense of the world and creates a feeling of mutuality among those with whom we share dislike. The fac- tions created around enemiesmay even bear a far-off resem-blance to true community. BETTER THAN BASHING Evangelicals, knowing that turn-ing candidates into verbalpunching bags will never createreal community, are called totalk about political figures in ways starkly different from the pundits and hate-marketers. While the loudest political voices this election season will keep only a loose rein on their tongues, evangelicals do well to ponder the Bible's insights intothe mysterious yet profound connection between a person'sheart and mouth: \"The things that come out of the mouth,\" saysJesus, \"come from the heart.\" Which is why Paul says, \"Now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, mal- ice, slander, and filthy language from your lips\" (Col. 3:8). Biblical psychology assumes not only that the words of our mouths revealthe state of our hearts, but that words have power to shape theheart\u2014for better or worse. What's more, vitriolic language directed at political figures does not, to use the Pauline metaphor, attract others with \"thearoma of Christ.\" It just creates a stench, making it more diffi-cult to nurture relationships with those who want to meetChrist and who happen to support Clinton. Such talk easilyslides into denigrating those on the other side of the politicalspectrum\u2014who may just be on the other side of the aisle onSunday mornings. None of this precludes vigorous and pointed disagreement inHating Hillary Getting to the bottom of a cultural trend that has seeped into the church.WHERE WE STAND CT's Views on Key Issues 26 C HRISTIANITY TODAY | March 2008PEditorials March P26_27 2/4/08 4:16 PM Page 26ILLOW CREEK Community Church in Barrington, Illinois, has for decades been demonstrating how churches can more effectively reach the unchurched. One reason they remain leaders is their relentless passion to connect withpeople who don't know Jesus Christ. Another is their intensityin discipling believers. A lesser-known reason is their willing-ness to ruthlessly examine their own success. Last summer, Willow published the results of their latest self- study, Reveal: Where Are You? The study surveyed Willow Creek and six otherAmerican churches, analyzing thousandsof responses and more than 100 inter-views. The report's cover says that readerswill learn \"surprising research findingsthat rocked Willow.\" As with everythingWillow, even their self-criticism is intensely passionate. The study shows that while Willow has been successfully meeting the spiritual needs of those who describe themselvesas \"exploring Christianity\" or \"growing in Christ,\" it has beenless successful at doing so with those who self-report as being\"close to Christ\" or \"Christ-centered.\" In fact, one-fourth of thelast two groups say that they are either \"stalled\" in their spiritu-al growth and/or \"dissatisfied\" with the church. As evidenced by the recent flurry of comments about Reveal in the blogosphere, those who admire and those who question Wil-low's seeker-sensitive approach will find plenty of ammunitionhere. As admirers of Willow, we offer one critique, as well as praise. Our ongoing concern about seeker-sensitive churches is not their willingness to change church culture so that it is not a need-less stumbling block to the unchurched. We're only troubledwhen such churches uncritically accept the metrics of marketingculture, and let consumer capitalism shape the church's theology. In Reveal , talk about the church is framed as if it were merelya distribution point for spiritual goods and services. For example, the study says that the dissatisfied, more than any other segment,have a much higher level of expectation \"for what the church canand should deliver.\" Furthermore, the dissatisfied say that whenit comes to engendering personal spiritual growth, \"the church isletting me down.\" The study's answer suggests a disturbingly low view of the church: It concludes that the dissatisfied need to realize that \"muchof the responsibility for their spiritual growth belongs to them \" (emphasis in the original). And \"We [atWillow] have to let people know early on intheir journey that they need to look beyond the church to grow\" (emphasis added). But according to the apostle Paul, the church is where each one is given a gift\"so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge ofthe Son of God and become mature ,attaining to the whole mea- sure of the fullness of Christ \" (Eph. 4:12-13). For Paul, solid spiritual growth cannot be found \"beyond the church,\" but only in its midst. The study rightly says, \"Our peo-ple need to learn to feed themselves through personal spiritualpractices.\" Unfortunately, the study fails to hint that these spiri-tual disciplines are intrinsically grounded in the ongoing life ofthe church. This implicit dualism (between private and corpo-rate spiritual growth) suggests something different from Paul'sview that it is in the body of Christ that we are joined togetherto \"grow up into him who is the Head\" (Eph. 4:15). Willow's study, of course, invites this very exercise in iron sharpening iron. It's precisely because of Willow's passion togrow people in Christ, its humility to undertake a self-study, andits vulnerability to publicize the results, that we're all thinkingmore deeply about what it means to be the church. Would thatmore congregations have such passion and humility. ct March 2008 | CHRISTIA NITY TODAY 27What Reveal Reveals Criticisms of Willow's latest self-study do not undermine its value.

Neither John the Baptist nor Jesus nor Paul was always meek and mild when they challenged the principali-ties and powers. But when vigorous political discourse turnsinto bashing of public figures, it perpetuates a great lie: that theyare merely the ideologies and symbols attached to them. When acandidate's ideology is mistaken for his or her personhood, itmasks a crucial truth: that each person, no matter their politicalviews, bears God's image and matters deeply to him. While pundits see candidates as punching bags, evangelicals are supposed to see candidates as, well, people. As we ponderhow candidates are \"fearfully and wonderfully made,\" we mayhaltingly come to realize that the most bold and courageousthing we each could do this election season, no matter who wevote for, is this: Love Hillary. ct TODAY | March 2008NE BY ONE , men trickle into the unadorned upstairs church classroom for their regular Thursday night meeting. But the gather- ing isn't to discuss plans for evangelism outreach, worship-song selection, or expanding the nursery. \"I'm Kevin and I'm a recovering sex addict,\" one of the eight men seated around the table says shortly after the meeting begins. Each man talks uninterruptedly for up to five minutes about how he's faced a myriad of sexual temptations. No one is allowed to advise, criticize, defend, or excuse the behavior of anoth- er man during this faith-based, 90-minute, 12-step recovery meeting called Operation Integrity. These aren't convicted pedophiles or registered sex offenders. They are churchgo- ers, businessmen, and seemingly model husbands. Throughout the country, there are men by the millions sitting comfortably in church pews every Sunday who haven'ttold anyone about their sexual addiction. But the men in this room have cometo terms with their own powerlessness over destructive sexual habits. After sharing their stories, the men take turns reading paragraphs from When Lost Men Come Home , written by Operation Integrity ( OI) founder David Zailer. Lively discussion ensues. The meeting provides a roller-coaster ride of successes and frustra- tions from the past week. Words such as \"sin,\" \"addiction,\" \"acting out,\"and \"selfishness\" are repeated. These men are doing better than when theystarted the group; none is where he hopes to be. This OIchapter meets at Coast Hills Community Church, a nondenominational Southern Californian megachurch in Aliso Viejo, where Zailer attends. The men rep-resent four area congregations. Sonny relates the temptation of seeing a curvaceous female wearing a string bikini at a nearby beach; not only that, she came up to him and started a conversation. \"Why would a woman be wearing a string bikini during the last week of October?\" Sonny asks his tablemates, and then tells them he resisted the urge to exchange phonenumbers.

A guy may show up because he feels guilty, his wife demanded it, or he may have good intentions. But if he's not broken, he won't stay. Our program is for desperate men.\" BEYOND LUST The dividing line between sexual lust and addiction is often hard todraw. While not listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM -IV), sexual addiction is widely recognized as a harmful behavior with a strong biochemical component (e.g., by the Mayo Clinic). An addiction to sex, experts say, is defined by obsessive sexual behav- ior regardless of the growing negative consequences for the person or their relationships. The sex addict has tried to stop but hasn't been able to do so, despite destructive results and deep feelings of shame. The addict can never hate the sin or himself enough to stop. A widely recognized authority, Patrick Carnes, author and executive director of the Gentle Path program at Pine GroveBehavioral Health and Addiction Services in Mississippi, esti-mates that 8 percent of adult men and 3 percent of adult womenbecome sexually addicted at some point in their lives (this articlewill focus on the greater problem, male sexual addiction). That means roughly 30 million or more Americans may have this disor- der. The sex addict becomes hooked on the neurochemicalresponse of the body during sexual behavior, which may includecompulsive masturbation, anonymous sex, multiple partners,exhibitionism, voyeurism, viewing Internet pornography, orcrimes such as sexual abuse and rape. Christian counselors and psychologists say the extent of the sex-addiction problem and the scarcity of treatment programs means millions of churchgoing men and women remain stuck in a cycle of sexual addiction, sometimes for decades. Guilt and shamekeep them suffering in silence. A church culture that provides fewopportunities to address sexual sin inhibits most addicts fromtelling anyone else. Often the addict doesn't seek help until a crisisoccurs\u2014such as being fired for looking at Internet porn at work. New faith-based addiction recovery organizations that under- stand sex addiction are beginning to emerge. There are more than 60 recovery groups around the country specifically for sex addic- tion. That includes Pure Warriors, Pure Desire, Pure Life, Opera-tion Integrity, and the Samson Society. Most operate on a smallscale and are growing gradually. Their methods differ, but all these programs share the belief that an addict is powerless to change behavior on his own. The OI meeting in Aliso Viejo included: Kevin, 53, a real-estate agent caught by his wife looking at Internet porn before a Sunday morning church service. Tommy, 35, a political consultant who spent more than three years participating in mate-swapping on Saturday nights,and regularly sitting in church on Sunday mornings. Nelson, 38, a self-employed businessman discovered by his girlfriend carrying on an emotional relationship in cyberspace. Evan, 43, a building contractor who claims to have had sexu- al intercourse with more than 1,000 women. Perceived lack of sexual fulfillment is a common precursor to sex addiction. Nate Larkin, founder of the Samson Society, told CT that an addiction may start with a preoccupying sense of dissatisfac-tion, followed by a craving for relief. Then comes creation of a plan,followed by deception, and then the compulsive sexual act itself. \"The euphoria would pass, leaving me disappointed, awash in self-loathing, cursing myself for my stupidity, and promising never ever to do that again,\" Larkin, 51, writes in Samson and the Pirate Monks: Calling Men to Authentic Brotherhood . \"I would step back into my regular life with renewed resolve, but before long my inner emptiness and dissatisfaction would start scream-ing for relief, and the cycle would begin again.\" Douglas Weiss, 45, executive director of Heart to Heart Coun- seling Center in Colorado Springs, says an addict's brain doesn'tdiscern whether his sexual behavior is moral or immoral\u2014the addict only knows that this is a place to feel loved, important, and significant, albeit only temporarily. The average addict is double-minded. Part of him desires to live a holy life. Another part wants to gaze at porn or have casualsex.

While conversationmay touch on baseball, country music, ortheology, it will certainly hit on a topic mostevangelical gatherings avoid: sex addiction. Some 15 churches in the city of 56,000 support Samson Society meetings, and thesemen represent a wide spectrum of denomi-nations. Like the biblical character Samson,the men come broken by some failure. \"Mostof us have been trapped in some kind ofcompulsive activity, but our addictions donot define us, and we do not segregate ourmembership by behavior,\" says its website.Ultimately these men have come together forhealing and mutual discipleship in Christ(see samsonsociety.org for more details). They say they are not an accountability group, nor a 12-step group, nor a men'sgroup. (\"Okay, so there are no women,\" saysits website, \"but that doesn't make us amen's group, does it? Please. Most of us havehad it up to herewith men's groups.\") Sam- son is different from most recovery groups inthat it doesn't have a centralized office, hier-archical structure, dues collecting, or propertyownership. Rather, Samson is simply \"a fel-lowship of Christian men who are seriousabout authenticity, community, humility, andrecovery\u2014serious, but not grave.\" But past sexual failure is what binds many of these men together, and their fellowship provides the primary avenue to sexual freedom. Eric Brown, a 39-year-old accountant, started attending Samson Society meetingsbecause his girlfriend insisted. \"I walked out of that first meeting thinking, These guys are really screwed up,\" Brown'THESE GUYS ARE REALLY SCREWED UP' And 1/31/08 8:50 AM Page 30improper behavior. \"Satan loves it when we think we can defeat this on our own,\" says Mark R. Laaser, author of Healing the Wounds of Sexual Addiction. Laaser, 57, believes anger is the primary reason Christ-ian men commit sexual sin. \"They are angry at God, angry at their spouse, angry at church,\" he says. \"They feel abandoned.\" Laaser says there is often an \"entitlement factor\": Many men minimize the sin because they believe they are overworked and underappreciated; therefore, looking at porn and masturbating isno big deal. DISEASE OR SIN? Is sexual addiction a disease or simply immoral behavior? BobHughes, a clinical psychologist in Laguna Hills, California, speaksfor many Christian therapists in seeing sex addiction as both asinful choice and a biological disease. One may begin by repeatedly making a sexual choice that turns into an addiction. Then, \"as an addiction, it can grab onto aperson and rob him of his volition,\" says Hughes, who helped Zailer in his recovery and has referred 30 clients to OI. Heart to Heart's Weiss, who has been sober for 20 years, con- ducts intensive three-day seminars so sex addicts can determine the profile of their addiction, whether its dynamics are primarilybiological, psychological, spiritual, trauma-based, or related to sexual avoidance, or a combination thereof. Weiss, author of The Final Freedom: Pioneering Sexual Addiction Recovery , says once a pattern is identified, strategies are developed for treatment. recalls. \"Two weeks later, I understood that my sin was no better than anyone else's.\" With his Samson brothers, Brown has found for the first time sincere friends, menhe accompanies on weekend trips and hangsout with in their homes. He usually talkswith three of them every day. Samson Society meetings incorporate a faith dimension that other programs lack.Richard Roberts had attended SexaholicsAnonymous ( SA) meetings in Las Vegas before moving to Franklin. \"At SA, all you talk about is your addiction,\" says the 46-year-old manager.\"But as Christian men, there is so much moreto us. [They] remind me who I am in Christ.\" Some participants come from the ranks of Christian leaders. Isaac, a teacher at a Chris-tian school, says Samson Society has revolu-tionized his 10-year marriage. \"Samson became the missing piece for my family,\" says Isaac, 31. \"Now I'm best friendswith my wife, who knows my triggers.\" Because of his ministry-related career, Isaac had resisted looking for help for hishardcore-porn addiction. He saw a repeatedpattern at church of men confessing their sex-ual sin, then being ostracized. He would peri-odically confess his porn use to his wife, buthe didn't make changes in his thought life.Weeks later, he'd be back in the old pattern. Now, he often talks to\u2014or prays with\u2014his \"Silas\" accountability partner twice a day onthe phone. If his wife travels out of the city forthe weekend, Isaac makes sure a buddy con-fiscates his computer. That's not weakness;it's a desire for purity. \"I'm not a sex addictwho will never get better,\" Isaac says. \"I'm arestored son of the sovereign Lord.\" \u2014John W. Kennedy Samson Society is sort of proud of it.'The new epidemic provides the church with an unparalleled opportunity.' NATE LARKINSex P28_35 1/31/08 8:51 AM Page 31Although sex addiction has been around for centuries, only in the past generation has it been recognized also as an illness, much like alcohol and drug addiction. Thirty years ago, Pine Grove'sCarnes pioneered research that showed how sex addicts' brainsundergo changes during the point of orgasm, akin to the euphoria a cocaine addict feels. And as with drug addiction, over time the sex addict chases new highs to try to create the same feeling, afeeling that the brain now craves. In the wake of Carnes'sresearch, groups such as Sex Addicts Anonymous and SexaholicsAnonymous formed. While Christian men often think of their addiction primarily as a sinful obsession with sex, the compulsive and destructivenature of the problem shows that more is going on. Zailer asserts,\"People can't change the sin until they address the disease part,\"meaning the neurochemical craving that overwhelms them. As with many leaders of recovery groups, the handsome and muscular Zailer seems an unlikely candidate to be in a recoverygroup. A family friend from church began to sexually abuse him atage eight. Alcoholism and crack-cocaine dependency followed.He spent five years as a porn actor. As an alternative to an eight-year prison term for drug crimes, Zailer spent eighteen months in a treatment program. While tryingto stop his sex addiction, Zailer says he became increasingly obses-sive about sex. \"I made repeated commitments to stop,\" he says. \"Butno amount of self-determination or religious activity protected me.\" Zailer found few in church circles eager to hear honest talk about sexual sin. Zailer began OIon a 12-step model in 2001.There are now six groups in three states. Everyone who attends OIhas a phone list and develops his own friendships within the group. A guy who wants help initiates a call to a sponsor, some-times daily. Zailer earns a living by building swimming pools. Hisday is full of cell phone calls from men looking for encourage-ment. He typically signs off with a heartfelt, \"Love ya.\" INTERNET ACCELERATES ADDICTION Until recently, those who suffered sexual abuse during childhoodhave been at a higher risk of sexual addiction. Sexual abuse tendsto produce oppressive or repressive behavior. A victim willattempt to change the outcome of what happened through \"reen-actment.\" This is often done with subconscious motives. Four outof five sex addicts are sex-abuse survivors, according to Carnes. Three out of four suffered physical abuse and nearly all have been emotionally abused, he says. Many addicts eventually learnthat sexual issues had been a problem in the lives of their fathers. But now, the Internet has made practically anyone vulnerable, and it has nothing to do with abuse. \"We used to think that the pressure of childhood trauma was one of the essential ingredients in the creation of the sex addict,\"Laaser says. \"But the Internet has changed that. Now there arepeople without the extensive history [of abuse] who get suckedinto sex addiction.\" \"There are now people struggling with sexual compulsivity who never would have been if not for the Internet,\" Carnes writes in thethird edition of Out of the Shadows: Understanding Sexual Addiction . 32 C HRISTIANITY TODAY | March 2008 'Knowing the whole truth is foundational to building a new life together.' DEBRA LAASERSex P28_35 1/31/08 8:52 AM Page nearly accompanied by mastur- bation. Swirling emotions surround the mood-altering experience. Some men never move past this stage. Addicts bring different beliefs into their views on pornography, based on their spiritual and familial backgrounds. It also depends on how much and what type ofpornography is being consumed. Progression will likely be quickerfor someone who watches orgy films nightly than for someone look- ing at a soft-core porn magazine monthly. If sex is the top \"medica- tor\" of an addict, progression is rapid. The addict develops a toler-ance for new behaviors if they bring temporary relief. Others progress rapidly to increasingly exotic, perverse, and even illegal sexual behavior: exhibitionism, voyeurism, strip clubs, lap dances, massage parlors, adultery, prostitution, homo- sexual liaisons, rape, incest, bestiality, or child molestation\u2014any-thing to feed the craving. \"A major factor in progression is what a guy fantasizes about during sexual release,\" Weiss says. \"If a guy masturbates to some- thing it would take a prostitute to do, he's more likely to find one.\" CONFESSION WORKS Most experts believe recovery should not be one-size-fits-all, but tailored to the individual. In most cases, a personal accountabilitypartner and weekly group meetings are supplemented with pro-fessional help from a psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, or evenin-patient treatment. Christian counselors agree that wholeness must begin with confessing the sin and stopping the behavior. Healing requires theaddict to accept responsibility for succumbing to a life of addic-tion rather than blame his upbringing, wife, or society. In the early stages of his recovery, Laaser says he needed to have daily accountability and go to weekly support groups. After beingsober for two decades, such stringent vigilance isn't required, hesays, and depicting someone as a lifelong sex addict can be counter- productive. \"People get better,\" Laaser says. \"Am I still a sex addict per se? No, I'm a man who's vulnerable to sexuality.\" Still, Laaser believes in safety in numbers. The more in a man's circle aware of his problems, the greater the probability he willget better. \"One guy is not enough,\" he says. \"What if that guy issick, or not home, or not in a good mood that day? Plus it's toughto fool 10 guys.\" In an accountability network, participants recognize they will at times be too vulnerable or too weak to call for help. Thus, anaddict gives permission to other men to call and check on him. \"I have never met anyone who has experienced sexual- addiction recovery alone,\" Weiss says. \"When you are account-able, sobriety is a much greater goal than just being abstinent.\" Some experts suggest reconditioning behavior is the key. Weiss advocates snapping a rubber band on the wrist every timethere is an inappropriate thought. Fred Stoeker, coauthor of theEvery Man's Battle series, teaches a technique he calls \"bouncing the eyes\"\u2014turning one's attention elsewhere whenever seeingsomething sexually explicit. Still others take a different approach. Steve Gallagher, who founded Pure Life Ministries in 1986, isn't enthusiastic about intro-spective psychotherapy. Gallagher, 53, believes support groupsencourage participants to keep that particular sin in the forefrontof their identity, even years after recovery. He says, \"Biblicalaccountability was never meant to be a group of men sitting in acircle discussing their failures.\" Most men, he believes, aren't willing to sever old habits that lead to sin, such as watching whatever they want on television. \"Aman can go to psychologists, support groups, or deliverance ser-vices,\" Gallagher writes in At the Altar of Sexual Idolatry. \"He can be prayed for by a famous evangelist or commit himself to a sexual-addiction clinic, but if hewants to overcome habitual sin, he mustlearn to walk in the Spirit.\" Tools such as Internet filters and accountability partners can help for a season, Gallagher says, butuntil a man experiences real repentance, he will remain stuck insexual sin. That much everyone seems to believe. Larkin says that only when he surrendered his will completely to God rather than try- ing to fix things through his own moral efforts did healing begin. \"For those of us who spent years resolutely steering our lives fromone ditch to another,\" says Larkin, \"one of the most practical waysto surrender to Christ is to pick up the telephone and tell the truthto another Christian.\" Zailer says, \"It's important to keep a pulse on the problem. Recovery is wasted when we forget our failures.\" SHATTERED VOWS Not surprisingly, sexual addiction has a devastating effect on mar-riages. Laaser's wife, Debra, thought she had a loving and stablemarriage. Her husband had a career as a respected full-time mar-riage counselor. He also taught part time as a Christian collegeprofessor and served as an interim preacher. Debra experienced the shock of her life 15 years into the mar- riage: Her husband had been fired for initiating sex with severalvulnerable women clients. At the time, Mark had almost complet-ed a doctorate in religion and psychology. It's taken 20 years for Debra, 57, to be emotionally ready to write about the experience in Shattered Vows: Hope and Healingfor Women Who Have Been Sexually Betrayed . Initially she asked, Should I make him move out? Will I ever feel like letting him touch me again? Will I ever be able to trust him again? Other worries came after her husband went to rehab. What do I tell the three kids? Have I been exposed to sexuallytransmitted diseases? Do I really know everything that happened? Mark admits that he had become a skillful liar. Trust was rebuilt slowly. Ultimately Debra realized she couldn't mother orrescue her husband. \"If you will not or cannot give up your role ofDirector of Husband Security,\" she writes, \"he will continue tofind ways to sneak around your devices.\" The wife of Pure Life's founder, Kathy Gallagher, learned she had married a sex addict soon after their wedding. Steve told his20-year-old bride that she was too skinny and not pretty enough.Thinking Steve would truly love her if she acquiesced to his sexu-al demands, Kathy agreed to look at porn with him. Then he wanted her to participate in orgies. Afraid to lose the marriage, she complied, but began using drugs to numb her con- March 2008 | C HRISTIANITY TODAY 33 COVER STORYHELP FOR THE SEXUALLY DESPERATEKERI PICKETTSex P28_35 1/31/08 8:52 AM Page 33science. Two months later, after discovering that her increasingly insatiable husband had been going to massage parlors and visitingprostitutes, she left him. After Steve agreed to get help, Kathy returned. They have been married for 28 years, and she has been administrator of Pure Life Ministries for 19 years. Whatever form infidelity takes, the spouse is left feeling betrayed, alone, and afraid. Debra Laaser says many wives are hurt more by the deception than the infidelity. How the wife reacts to a husband's sexual addiction is a determining factor inhealing. Some women na\u00efvely think a one-time confession bytheir husband will resolve everything. Other wives, even thosewho have ignored warning signs, file for divorce at the first reve- lation of porn use. There is no blanket answer to when and how much to tell one's wife. While complete honesty is the best policy, some experts say addicts make the mis- take of blurting out too much too soon. \"Wives should not be the dumping ground for guilt and shame,\" Zailer says. \"If a guy has taken 20 years to messup his life, it's not going to get better in three days.\" On the other hand, Debra Laaser recommends full disclosure up front rather than the installment plan. \"Knowing the whole truth isfoundational to building a new life together, because the new struc- ture must be built on honesty and openness,\" she writes. \"Your hus- band can stop living with secrets that keep him hiding his behav-iors, lying, and walking on eggshells in fear of your finding out.\" TheLaasers, who have been married for 35 years, now work togetherhelping sex addicts through Faithful and True Ministries. \"I advise guys to give wives a categorical confession, but not subject her to any specifics she hasn'tasked about,\" Larkin says. STIGMA LINGERS Typically, pastors aren't trained to dealwith sexual sins, let alone addiction.Many denominations have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to pornuse, so a pastor isn't likely to confess his porn viewing to a superior if it means losing his livelihood. Yet can the churchbe truly effective if it's not a safe place fora man to divulge details about his ongoingstruggles? If the struggles are dealt withearly, it can't help but slow down the rate of addiction. But talking about sexual problems is difficult in a church setting. \"The church is going to have to decide if it's going to fight to be the pure bride ofChrist,\" says Stuart Vogelman, executivedirector of Pure Warrior Ministries inValleyford, Washington. \"It's probablygoing to be the toughest battle the churchhas ever faced, and most churches arenot equipped for it.\" Ted Roberts's ministry is an excep-tion. For 15 years, Roberts has led thousands of men in sexual purity classes at East Hill Foursquare Church in Gresham, Ore- gon. This year, the 63-year-old senior pastor will relinquish thepulpit he's held for 22 years and work full time with Pure DesireMinistries. In weekly meetings and more frequent phone calls, Pure Desire men spend two to five years stopping unhealthy sexualbehaviors. Since 1990, more than 1,000 men have completed PureLife Ministries' six-month residential treatment program. INTEGRITY DAILY Nate Larkin is a low-key, pensive, bookish-looking man, befittingsomeone who earned a master's of divinity from Princeton Theolog-ical Seminary. Following graduation, he became a successful, dynamic pastor in the eyes of his thriving congregation. Larkin's story has similarities to Zailer's: a strict religious upbringing that included frequent church attendance, a distant father, a mother who committed suicide, a decision to cease sexu- ally acting out at age 41, and brutal transparency about addiction. For Larkin, the descent from pornography into a series of encounters with streetwalkers escalated rapidly. The first occurred en route to a Christmas Eve candlelight service at which he officiated. In exchange for fellatio, he paid the prostitute the$20 he had earmarked for the collection plate. Larkin details his former life and return to integrity in Samson and the Pirate Monks. The book tells about the start in 2004 ofthe Samson Society, a community of Christian believers commit-ted to collaborative discipleship (see \"These Guys Are ReallyScrewed Up,\" page 30). Larkin, who now earns an income pro-ducing technical reports for engineers, doesn't want to fall into leadership traps that led to a swelled head as a pastor. Every Monday night, Larkin attends a one-hour Samson Society meeting at hishome church, Christ Community, a PCA congregation in Franklin, Tennessee. On arainy night in November, 15 men sit downon blue padded chairs arranged in a large circle in a classroom with mustard- colored walls. Some guys are in their 20s; others in their 60s. Some are handsome and muscular, others scrawny and plain. They are at different stages of healing. Tonight's discussion is on hope, selected from a list of more than 200 suggestions, a different one of which ischosen each week. After preliminaries,the men count off by threes to break upinto random groups of five. The smallercircles provide time for the men tolaugh, joke, or cry without being inter-rupted, confronted, or corrected. It's atime to spew innermost fears, joys, andfrustrations. It's a place to be heard andaffirmed. Men can share more thanonce. There might be long silent pauses.

STEVE GALLAGHER During the meeting within the meeting, Larkin's cell phone buzzes four times, all calls from other Samson attendees around the country. There are Samson groups in 17 states. Scarcely anhour of the day goes by that Larkin doesn't take or make a phonecall related to Samson. Usually they are brief check-ins. Occasion- ally a crisis occurs that will precipitate a long conversation. Men refrain from offering advice at Samson meetings. That is reserved for private, more involved get-togethers with one's trust- worthy traveling companion, called a \"Silas.\" Samson is not somuch about what happens at the meetings as in between. A man usually connects with his Silas on the phone every day, offering encouragement and feedback. It's more about formingreal relationships, not oppressive accountability. \"If it feels likechecking in with a parole officer, it gets old fast,\" Larkin says afterthe meeting, when most men head off to a local Irish pub or aMexican restaurant for further fellowship. Larkin goes to McCreary's to meet Allie, his wife of 29 years. Nate first mentioned he had a struggle with porn four years intotheir marriage. She assumed everything was fine because he rarelymentioned it again. But in 1998, Allie, already in menopause, founda condom among Nate's possessions. If she had known the depthof his addiction at first, she likely would have divorced him. Notuntil 2002 did she learn of his escapades with prostitutes. Today, Allie knows all the details in the book, although she doesn't want to read it. The Larkins spend virtually every eveningtogether. After years of emotional detachment, Nate's gregariouslaugh at the eatery is evidence that his best friend is his wife.OPPORTUNITY AWAITS Experts say sexual addiction is bound to worsen because teens aretoday's largest porn users. Addiction begins with simple tempta-tions or manageable sexual problems. But says East Hill Church'sRoberts, \"No matter where I travel in the world men have thesame problem, but no one talks about it.\" While addiction is a crippling weakness, when brought to light, it's a form of empowerment. Laaser says he is weary of retelling hispersonal tragedy, but it's necessary to offer hope to others. \"Silenceis the greatest enemy of sexual health,\" he says. \"There are wounded men in every country medicating their pain through sexually compulsive behavior,\" says Vogelman,who spent 23 years as an international high-tech healthcare business consultant. \"But the very guys that Satan poisons arecoming out of that bondage to minister to other men as theyrecover themselves.\" Several therapists and pastors liken sex addiction to a coming tsunami. Larkin thinks they're off base. \"The tidal wave has passed,\" he says. \"We're standing around in our shorts.\" Yet Larkin is optimistic. \"This new epidemic provides the church with an unparalleled opportunity,\" he says. \"The Enemyhas overplayed his hand. Desperate men will do what they have todo to get help.\" John W.

These problems resist easy solutions. They arerobust\u2014powerful, pervasive, and systemic. Do we have a gospel big enough for these problems? Do we have the confidence to declare that these robust problems, all of whichbegin with sin against God and then creep into the world like can- cer, have been conquered by a robust gospel? When I read the Gospels, I see a Lion of Judah who roared with a kingdom gospel that challenged both Israel's and Rome's mighty men, gathered up the sick and dying and made them whole, and united the purity-obsessed \"clean\" and the shame-laden \"unclean\" around one table. When I read the apostle Paul, I see a man whocarried a gospel that he believed could save as well as unite Gentiles and barbarianswith Abraham's sacred descendants. I do not think their gospel was too small. I sometimes worry we have settled for a little gospel, a miniaturized version that cannot address the robust problems of our world. But as close to us as thepages of a nearby Bible, we can find the Bible's robust gospel, a gospel that is muchbigger than many of us have dared to believe: The gospel is the story of the work of the triune God (Father, Son, and Spirit) to completely restore broken image-bearers (Gen. 1:26-27) in the context ofOThis year the Christian Vision Project is asking our simplest but most important question yet: Is our gospel too small? Scot McKnight, professor of New Testament at North Park University, certainly can't be accused of thinking small in his biblical and theological studies. To the contrary, in books like The Jesus Creed and A Community Called Atonement , he has demonstrated a knack for picking big topics and approaching them in surprising and enlightening ways. McK-night's weblog, JesusCreed.org, is an oasis of careful thought and Christian intelligence, finelyattuned to contemporary theological debates yet deeply rooted in the study of Scripture and theChristian tradition. These qualities are also evident in his response to our big, small question.by Scot McKnight ART WOLFE / GETTY 36 C HRISTIANITY TODAY | March 2008CVP March P36_39 2/4/08 4:30 PM 36by March 2008 | C HRISTIANITY TODAY 37REVIVING FORGOTTEN CHAPTERS IN THE STORY OF REDEMPTION.CVP March P36_39 2/4/08 4:30 PM Page 37the community of faith (Israel, Kingdom, and Church) through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christand the gift of the Pentecostal Spirit, to union with Godand communion with others for the good of the world. The gospel may be bigger than this description, but it is certainly not smaller. And as we declare this robust gospelin the face of our real, robust problems, we will rediscoverjust how different it is from the small gospel we sometimeshave believed and proclaimed. 1. The robust gospel is a story. Jesus didn't drop out of the heavens one snowy night in Bethlehem to a worldhushed for Advent. Instead, Jesus' birth came in the midst ofa story with a beginning, a problem, and a lengthy history.When Jesus stood up to announce the \"gospel of the king-dom\" (Matt. 4:23), the first thing his hearers would havefocused on was not the word gospel but the word kingdom \u2014 the climax of Israel's story and its yearning for the eternalmessianic reign. Gospel-preaching for Jesus had the samehope and summons to a new way of life (3:10-14)\u2014namely, the fulfillment of the wholestory's hope, the kingdom of God. This is why Paul definesgospel after its first mention in Romans 1:1 with this: \"which he promised beforehand through his prophets, the gospelconcerning his Son, who was descended from David\" ( NRSV ). To preach the gospel and to believe the gospel is to offer andenter into a story. 2. The robust gospel places transactions in the con- text of persons. When the gospel is reduced to a legal trans- action shifting our guilt to Christ and Christ's righteousnessto us, the gospel focuses too narrowly on a transaction andbecomes too impersonal. We dare not deny transaction orwhat's called double imputation, but the gospel is more thanthe transactions of imputation. The robust gospel of theBible is personal\u2014it is about God the Father, God the Son,and God the Spirit. It is about you and me as persons encoun-tering that personal, three-personed God. Indeed, more often than not in the New Testament, the gospel is linked explicitly to a person. It is the \"gospel ofChrist\" or the \"gospel of God.\" Jesus calls people to losetheir life \"for mysake\" and, to say the same thing differently, \"for the sake of the gospel\" and \"the glorious gospel of the blessed God\"(1 Tim. 1:11). Paul tells us that the gospel is the gloriouspower of God's Spirit to transform broken image-bearersinto the glory of God that can be seen in the face of the per-fect image-bearer, Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 3:18-4:6). In ourproclamation, too, the focus of the gospel must be on God asperson and our encountering that personal God in the faceof Jesus Christ through the power of the Spirit. 3. The robust gospel deals with a robust problem. Genesis 1-3 teaches us that humans are made in God's image and likeness. These image-bearers were in utterunion with God, at home with themselves, in communionwith one another, and in harmony with the world aroundthem. When Eve, with her husband in tow, chose to eat ofthe wrong tree, the image was cracked in each of those fourdirections: God-alienation, self-shame, other-blame, andEden-expulsion. Sin results not only in alienation from God,which is paramount, but also in shame of the self, blame andantagonism toward others, and banishment from the worldas God made it to be. The proportions of the biblical problem are not small; the problems are so robust that a robust gospel is needed.The rest of the Bible, from Genesis 4 to Revelation 22, isabout these cracked image-bearers being restored to unionwith God, freed from shame, placed in communion withothers, and offered to the world. Any gospel that does notexpand the \"problem\" of Genesis 3 to these cosmic dimen-sions is not robust enough. 4. A robust gospel has a grand vision. The little gospel promises me personal salvation and eternal life. But the robust gospel doesn't stop there. It also promises a newsociety and a new creation. When Jesus stood up to readIsaiah 61 in the synagogue at Nazareth, then sat down anddeclared that this prophetic vision was now coming to passthrough him, there was more than personal redemption atwork. God's kingdom, the society where God's will is estab-lished and lived, was now officially at work in his followers.That society was overturning the injustices and exclusionsof the empire and establishing an inclusive and just alterna-tive. We find this in Jesus' opening words (Luke 4:18-19),the Beatitudes (6:20-26), and in his response to John (Mark7:22-23). This vision for a just society led to the radicalpractices of generosity and hospitality in the Jerusalemchurches (Acts 2:42-47). Any gospel that is not announcinga new society at work in the world, what the apostle Paulcalled the church, is simply not a robust gospel. 5. A robust gospel includes the life of Jesus as well as his resurrection, and the gift of the Spirit alongsideGood Friday. Paul said he preached \"Christ crucified,\" but the crucified Christ Paul preached was an empty-cross Christand an empty-grave Christ. That same gospel of Christ cruci-fied was rooted in an incarnate life. And that same Christ crucified, after his 40 days of appearances and ascension, sentthe Holy Spirit at Pentecost in order to empower his followersto become the church as a new creation. If our only problem is individual guilt, the solution can be reduced to Good Friday. But as we acknowledge ourproblem in its true biblical proportions, we need more thanGood Friday: we need Christmas as Incarnation, Good Fri-day as Substitution and Paradigm and the stripping of sys- 38 C HRISTIANITY TODAY | March 2008THE 8 MARKS OF A ROBUST GOSPEL Any gospel that is not announcing a new society at work in the world, wCVP March P36_39 1/31/08 2:54 PM Page 38temic powers from their illegitimate thrones, Easter as New Creation, andPentecost as Empowerment. The robust gospel incorporates us into the life of Jesus Christ, into hisdeath with us, for us, and instead of us, into the Resurrection that justifies and creates new life, and the Pentecostal Spirit thatempowers us to live together, asimage-bearers of God, in such away that we glow with the glory of the blessed God. 6. A robust gospel demands not only faith but everything. Inherent in the robust, biblical view of the gospel is a view of faith that involves repentance, trust, surrender, commitment, and obedience. Paul warns of those who do not \"obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ\" (2 Thess. 1:8). Paul can say that his intent in preaching the gospel is to bring about the \" obedience of faith\" (Rom. 1:5). Jesus' gospel can be found in Mark1:14-15: \"Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, andbelieve in the good news.'\" And he called his disciples to sur-render themselves to him in self-denial so they could followhim (Mark 8:34-38). A robust gospel summons each of us to respond in repentance, trust, surrender, commitment, and obedience. Indeed, whole-hearted response to God is whatthe Jesus Creed, the double commandment to love God andto love others, is all about (Mark 12:29-31). The robust gospelcalls for a robust response of a robust person. 7. A robust gospel includes the robust Spirit of God. How often do we hear about the Spirit of God in our gospelpreaching? To our shame, the Spirit has been defined out ofthe gospel. But notice these words from the New Testa-ment's most notorious gospeler, Paul: \"For I will not ventureto speak of anything except what Christ has accomplishedthrough me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by wordand deed, by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and as far around asIllyricum I have fully proclaimed the good news of Christ\" (Rom. 15:18-19). For Paul, the gospel, the power of God untosalvation (1:16), was also the \"power of the Spirit of God.\"Again, \"In him you also, when you had heard the word oftruth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in him,were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit; thisis the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God'sown people, to the praise of his glory\" (Eph. 1:13-14). Jesus,too, said, \"But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast outdemons, then the kingdom of God has come to you\" (Matt.12:28). The gospel is animated by God's powerful Spirit, andits result is Spirit-empowerment for new living.8. A robust gospel emerges from and leads others to the church. The little gospel creates individuals who volunteer to attend church on the basis of their preferences in worship, friendships, ser- mons, and programs. The robust gospel knows that God's work, from the very beginning, has revolved around three words: Israel, Kingdom, and Church. Again, the words of Paul make this abundantly clear: \"In former genera- tions this mystery was not made known to humankind, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: that is, the Gentiles have become fellow heirs, members ofthe same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesusthrough the gospel\" (Eph. 3:5-6). The mystery of the gospel is that Gentiles have become fellow heirs with Jews in the promise of Christ Jesus. The gospel's intent, in fact its sub- stance, is the creation of God's new society with Jesus on the throne. The robust gospel emerges out of the church with good news and calls others into that same church. For 13 years I have been teaching a survey of the Bible at North Park University. I eventually learned that we cannot skip from Genesis 3 to either John 3 or Romans 3. We can-not skip from the Fall to the Cross. God chose, instead ofsending his Son to redeem Adam and Eve in Genesis 4, towait. And what God did between the time of Adam and Eveand Jesus Christ was to work redemption in the form ofcommunity. The Old Testament is about Israel; the New Testament is about Jesus and the church. The Bible is about God's people, the community of faith. The church is not aninstitution that provides benefits for individual Christians sothey can carry on their personal relationship with God untilthat church can no longer provide what they need. Instead,the church is the focus of God's redemptive work on earth inthe present age. So \"joining the church\" isn't an option for Christians. How often do we preach entering into the community offaith, the church, as inherent to what the gospel work of Godis all about? The little gospel gives the new believer thechoice about the local church; the robust biblical gospeloffers the new believer the church along with its Lord.Because ultimately, only a redeemed community is robustenough to do justice to the problems we confront\u2014and thegospel we proclaim. My physician tells me that the way I live during this decade will shape the way I live in the next decade. Like-wise, the way we preach the gospel in this decade will shapethe church of the next. A more robust gospel now will meana more robust church for the next generation.

Unlike most other Muslim-back- ground believers, there is nothing supernatural to tell about how I came in touch with Christians or decided to be one. On the contrary, I went to an old Anglican church with some friends because of an article about it in a local Turkish newspaper, which accused it ofluring young people to become Christians by offering them wine, 100 U.S. dol-lars every Sunday, and the possibility of marrying a young British woman. I was 17 years old when I had to face my family and relatives about my decision to be a follower of Jesus. I remember vividly how fearful I was, andhow isolated and alone I felt as I lay in the fetal position in a sleeping bag on afriend's floor. I am still broke, sober, and single after all these years, and I still struggle with shame, loneliness, and fear. As I read the testimonies of other believers and heard sermons about great faith heroes, I realized that I was not one of them. I daydreamed about Luther andhis courage to stand up for what he believed. I imagined him in front of the color- fully dressed, high-ranking clerics of the Diet of Worms, unshaken, strong, and confident. I could picture him saying his famous lines in a loud, confident tone: Unless I am convinced by the testimony of Scripture, or by the clearest reasoning, unless I am persuaded by means of the passages I have quoted,and unless they thus render my conscience bound by the Word of God, Icannot and will not retract, for it is unsafe for a Christian to speak againsthis conscience. But as for me, these lines from Pablo Neruda's poem \"We Are Many\" have always been more appropriate: All the books I read lionize dazzling hero figures,always brimming with self-assurance. I die with envy of them; and, in films where bullets fly on the wind, I am left in envy of the cowboys, left admiring even the horses. Twice, I came close to giving up my faith. On one of those occasions, I gen- uinely doubted whether or not Jesus was worth all the pain, and on the other I struggled with my commitment to work in the Middle East and the continu-ous price I pay, when I could have easily settled into a comfortable Christianlife in a Western country.

More Christians are killed than are saved from execution at the last minute.More Christians stay locked in prison,beaten and tortured, than are able to walkfree, guided by miraculous escape plans.More Christians suffer lifelong depriva-tion of their most basic civic and economicrights. More converts from Islam give uptheir faith than stay Christians, and those who remain in the church struggle with lifelong battles with shame, depression, and isolation, caused by the loss of ties totheir families, communities, and nations. Above all, for the average persecuted Christian, there are unanswered prayersand the absence of peace, strength,courage, and joy. Their humanness in avery earthly plot line finds no place in ourmodern-day obsession with heroic storieswith victorious resolutions. Fear of physical and emotional damage is manageable when one's ears and hearthear the loving and strengthening voice ofGod, and the assurance that the globalchurch will be there to embrace you. For persecuted Christians, suffering turns into affliction when they internalize the horrible feeling that they are alone. When the persecuted Christian begins tobelieve that most of the global church doesnot care and will not be there to share hispain, loneliness moves from the physicaldimension to an inner anguish. In fact, even my faith hero, Luther, found himself in the gray zone between suf-fering and affliction the night before his famous defense, as we see in his prayer: \"O Almighty and Everlasting God! How terri-ble is this world! Behold, it openeth itsmouth to swallow me up, and I have so littletrust in thee!\" This raises significant questions: Where is God when millions of his children arebeing persecuted in the most brutal ways?Why does he keep silent in the middle ofpersecution but speak loudly in the middle of conferences with famous speakers and worship bands? I have prayed many timeslike Luther: \"Bless us, Lord, even curse us!But don't remain silent!\" POST-CRUCIFIXION WORK This reality forces us to take another lookat what Paul means in Romans 8:28 by\"our good.\" If our good is a stable, safe,healthy, happy, and reasonably wealthymiddle-class life, then logically one canconclude that God really does not work for the good of the largest portion of the global church today. Similarly, when we look at Paul's list of sufferings in 2 Corinthians 11, it's clear thatPaul's life will never be known as a goodone by today's pop psychology or quick-fixspirituality books. Didn't Paul ever stopand wonder why he wasn't blessed? Since Paul is clearly an intelligent man who can recognize the problem, we are forced toentertain other possibilities. Maybe Paul was influenced by Stoic ideas that encouraged him to seek pain inorder to develop his strength and be a vir-tuous man. Perhaps Neoplatonic ideas thatsaw the material body as a hindrance to beovercome in order to achieve the freedomof the soul encouraged Paul to pursue a lifeof suffering and sacrifice. Or, one canemploy modern psychoanalytical toolsthat may show that Paul was a masochistwho actively sought pain and enjoyedbeing in such conditions. All of these potential answers point to self-gratification as the ultimate goal of 42 C HRISTIANITY TODAY | March 2008 The silence of God is not the same as theabsence of God.Within those silentmoments, he 2/1/08 10:39 AM Page 42life. This is parallel to our modern con- ceptions of the good life, for which theultimate end is self-satisfaction and glori- fication (although self-discipline was long ago discarded as a means to that end). At this point, the incapacity of the modern church to reconcile the suffering of the global church with the God of love is evident. But, our highest good is not aproblem-free life; it is to be like the Son. Paul continues to face a difficult life, but not because suffering itself is the end goal, as a virtue or merit. On the contrary, suffering is not about Paul or his salvationat all. He is not suffering because God iscruel and does not know how to treat hisfriends. Paul suffers and lives that life for a higher purpose: We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life ofJesus may also be revealed in ourbody. For we who are alive are alwaysbeing given over to death for Jesus'sake, so that his life may be revealed inour mortal body. So then, death is atwork in us, but life is at work in you. (2 Cor. 4:10-12) This higher purpose is identical to the purpose of the Son of God: to bring the life of God to us by his own sacrifice, and bydoing so, to glorify God's name. This dualpurpose, lifeand glory, echoes in the life and sacrifice of the apostle. Through his identi-fication with the Son of God in his suffering,what emerges is the continuation of thepost-crucifixion work of the Son of God. WHEN SILENCE IS THE VOICE The only way a deaf and blind world canhear and see the gospel message is by see-ing it in our lives. The only way the life ofChrist can reach the nations is by us fol-lowing his incarnation, submitting toGod's will, and presenting ourselves in allof our vulnerability. We do not accept this suffering in pas- sive resentment, because the calling of thechurch and the core of Christian spirituali-ty is to bring life to the world and glory to God. It is through our presence that others in spiritual need may receive the life Christ brings. Through our stubborn commitment to love those who persecute us and to dwellin nations that torment us, our witness forthe gospel gains power. That is why the Prophets of the Bible lived symbolic lives with symbolic actions, such as sitting indust and ashes. The lives of the Prophetswere the very voice of God speaking topeople, just as the life and sacrifices of Paul were the channels through which God spoke to the nations. In Europe, there is a saying: It is often dark at the foot of the lighthouse. There is oftensilence in the life that becomes the voice of God. The lighthouse imagery is helpful to conceptualize the paradox of death thatbrings life in the work and life of Paul. Yet the silence of God is not the same as the absence of God. Within those silentmoments, he is present in our pain, suffer- ing, and isolation. He is hurting with us as we are hurting like his Son. In his silence, heis speaking loudly to the world around us. The greatest glory Jesus brought to God was not when he walked on the water or prayed for long hours, but when he cried in agony in the garden of Gethsemane and stillcontinued to follow God's will, even thoughit meant isolation, darkness, and the silenceof God. Thus, we know that when every-thing around us fails, when we aredestroyed and abandoned, our tears, blood,and dead corpses are the greatest worship songs we have ever sung. The dead body is not the end of the story. The one who sacrificed his life is also the one who has been glorified:\"because we know that the one who raisedthe Lord Jesus from the dead will alsoraise us with Jesus and present us withyou in his presence\" (2 Cor. 4:14). When we identify ourselves with the humiliation, suffering, and death of Jesus, we are alsogranted the privilege of being identifiedwith the resurrection, glory, and reign of the Lord Jesus Christ. \"Therefore . . . we do not lose heart,\" even though we areweakened by suffering (2 Cor. 4:1). The promise of sharing his resurrection and glory gives us a great hope: that oursacrifices are not in vain and do not gounnoticed, even though no other humanbeing\u2014nor the global church\u2014may knowor care about what we are going through,even though we may not see any apparentrhyme or reason in our suffering now. This means that our calling to bring life to the world and glory to God has otherblessings besides the joy we have now: thejoy of bringing hope and light to a pain- filled world and the joy of pleasing the God we love, through our willing surrender tohis desire. Here I am speaking of a fargreater joy that awaits us: the joy of beingwelcomed, restored, and glorified by the Father, just as he welcomed, restored, and glorified his risen Son. Faith is the most precious and impor- tant commodity, without which it is impos- sible to please God or follow him. And faith is only proven real in the pit of darkness. Inthe classic book by C. S. Lewis, the moreexperienced demon, Screwtape, warns theyounger demon, who is assigned to lead a human being astray: Be not deceived, Wormwood, our cause is never more in jeopardy thanwhen a human, no longer desiringbut still intending to do our Enemy'swill, looks round upon a universe inwhich every trace of him seems tohave vanished, and asks why he hasbeen forsaken, and still obeys. REDEFINING THE QUESTION We do know where God is in the midst of persecution. He is there, right with us, in us.He is present through our lives, words,pain, and deaths. He has not forgotten us orturned away his face from us. He holds back his power so that we can accomplish his work, so that our sacrifices can be sourcesof life and healing to the world. He is notdistant from our pain; he is in prison withus, he is naked, he is beaten, he is raped, andhe is killed! We know that he is not quiet,but is speaking powerfully through thelives, suffering, and death of his children. As Christ prayed in agony in the garden during that dark night, he knew that he hadto carry on his calling even though it wouldcost him his life. He knew that it was theonly way to bring life. He knew that his bru-tal death would glorify God. Historychanged during that night, even before thecross. It changed when the Son of Godchose to not give up, to hold firm to God'scalling and promises, even though it meantbearing the silence of God.

March 2008 | C HRISTIANITY TODAY 43 ctMATT JONES / GENESISPersecution P40_43 2/1/08 10:40 AM Page 43ISTORIANS and foreign- policy experts have right- ly chronicled the abuses of American evangelical overseas missions, espe-cially in the era of colonial-ism. But Walter Russell Mead, Henry A. Kissinger Sr. Fellow for U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, takes a different tack. While acknowledging thedarker threads of both American and Chris- tian overseas engagement, he argues it is more necessary than ever that evangelicalsplay a role in American foreign affairs.Mead makes this case in his most recentbook, God and Gold: Britain, America, and the Making of the Modern World (Knopf). CTsenior managing editor Mark Galli asked Mead to unpack his thesis. You say your book is about the biggest geopolitical story in moderntimes. What is that story? The rise of this global system of politics, power, investment and trade, and cultureand ideology that was first dimly sketchedout by the Dutch, taken over by the Englishand then by the Americans. This is the operating software on which the world still runs: Version 1.0 was introduced by theDutch in about 1600, version 2.0, by the British in 1700, andversion 3.0, by the Americans in about 1945. Think about transportation. When Edward Gibbon was writing about the fall of the Roman Empire in the late 18thcentury, he could argue that transportation hadn't changedsince ancient times. An imperial messenger on the Roman roads could get from Rome to London even faster in A.D. 100 than in 1750. But by 1850, and even more obviously today, all of that has changed. You look at the steam-boat, the railroad, the car, the airplane\u2014not allof these were invented in the Anglo-Americanworld, but they were popularized and extended by it. Theywere made possible by the financial architecture, the capitalintensive operations invented and developed by the Anglo-Americans. Or take communications. The first telegraph line was from Washington to Baltimore. The underseas cables thatfor the first time united the world in instantaneous commu-nication, right up through the development of commercialand national radio networks, television, cable, satellites\u2014allof this has come about under this global system. A lot of it has been driven by the economic basis of that global system, which is capitalism. It was the need ofinvestors to get news fast and move people faster from onecity to another. The transportation and communication revolutions would alone be enough to talk about a massivecontribution to world history. But also think about the ideas of democracy, pluralism, liberalism, and freedom of religion. Again, these things, whichyou can trace back to the Dutch Republic, have become thefoundations of national and international politics. What role did religion play in this story? This very individualistic form of Protestant Christianity that became so basic in English and then Amer-ican life is to a large degree responsible for the historicalsuccess of Britain and America. That's part of it\u2014this formof Christianity, which is above all a very individual relation-ship with Christ. What is the swiftest moving and globalreligious movement in the history of the world? It's Pente-costalism, which is only a little over 100 years old, and start-ed in Los Angeles and grew primarily out of a long traditionin Anglo-American Christianity. On one hand, this religioustradition has been shaping Anglo-American success, but onthe other hand, especially in the 20th century, this kind ofChristianity has had an extraordinary impact on people who 44 C HRISTIANITY TODAY | March 2008H The CT InterviewThe CT Interview Our GeopoliticalMoment Walter Russell Mead argues that evangelicalshave a crucial role to play in American foreign affairs. interview by Mark GalliMeadGalli P44_51 2/1/08 10:45 AM Page 44DAN BIGELOW March 2008 | C HRISTIANITY TODAY 45live far beyond the boundaries of the U.S. or Great Britain. What do you mean when you say the great fundamental conviction of the English-speaking powers is that \"Godis a liberal\"? I mean liberal in the sense in which 19th-century English writers like Thomas Macaulay would use the word. Histori- cally, religions have often been linked to the absolute powerof state rulers. Think of the Catholic absolute monarchies ofFrance and Spain. If you were for freedom of religion, youwere irreligious. But in the English-speaking world, the idea that has taken hold is the freedom of people to choose a religion or to chooseno religion. We've come to that conviction on religiousgrounds. It's not that we think religion is bad or dangerous.It's because we think religion is good and important that webelieve in freedom of religion. And so the English-speakingworld has believed that religious liberty, political liberty, andeconomic liberty are consonant with Christianity; indeed, thatit is through those values and institutions that God's will forhumankind is most fully achieved. In addition, I'm trying to argue that in Anglo-American religion, the individual who looks to God for a justifyingfaith looks to a God who's going toreveal himself in the future. Look atthe faith of Abraham\u2014in a lot ofAnglo-American preaching, Abra-ham is the pattern of faith. What'sGod's command to Abraham? \"Getup and go. Leave your father's country. Stop worshiping your father's gods. Go to a new land and there I will fulfill the promise.\" This idea of a relationship with God that's realized in a world of change, in a world of departure, is an incredibly important aspect of how the Anglo-American world hasbecome so fitted to live in a world of capitalism, which is aworld of accelerating and intense social, political, and eco-nomic change. It's not just change, but a kind of optimism about the future. There's something very deep in the way Anglo-Americans have looked at the world that makes this kind of optimismso natural, since it's the flip side of this faith. If you have afaith that God is acting in history, that God is bringing goodout of evil, and that God is writing straight with crooked Warren Cabinet Member: Mead serveson Rick Warren's boardof advisers, P44_51 2/4/08 4:07 PM Page 45lines, then that kind of faith can very easily shift gears and become an optimism aboutthe future. You understand God's plan completely, and you can see that God is about to complete his plan with you. The optimism of the Anglo-American world of faith is basically a positive qual- ity. But one of the temptations we have to constantly guard against is to let ourfaith turn into a belief that we under-stand God's providence, we are theinstruments of God's providence, andwe're about to accomplish his will once and for all. Our history shows that this optimism has not always been justified. We Americans look at the last 300 years of history, and we basically see a world that'sgetting better and better. The rule of free-dom expands. The economy develops. Wehave risen to become the world's greatestpower. The American people are extraor-dinarily comfortable, affluent, and secure.It's easy for us to make the argument that God's purpose is being fulfilled through history and through the rise of Americanpower. And to some degree, it probably is. But suppose you are a sincere and pious Muslim. What you see in 1700 marksthe beginning of the rise of England andAmerica, the beginning of the great decline and collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Ultimately it will be divided intolittle pieces. The English are beginning tochallenge the great Islamic empire ofIndia. The Persians are beginning to losetheir greatness. Over the next 300 years, itjust gets uglier and uglier. The Muslimsare driven out of Europe and in many cases, ethnically cleansed or persecuted. The English stopped the expansion ofIslam in Nigeria. The Spanish colonialsstopped the expansion of Islam into thePhilippines. What you see is a historythat's gone wrong, a very different attitudeabout the modern era and the values thathave shaped it. That's just the tip of the iceberg. As many have convincingly argued, demo-cratic capitalism has often beenexploitive and unjust. This does notsound like a great story. If you're someone who believes, as I do, that humanity is fallen and warped in vari-ous ways, it's not surprising that there's nosuch thing as a perfect social system thatproduces perfect human beings. TheAnglo-Americans have exploited theirpower. They have often treated weaker orpoorer peoples with great injustice. In the OUR GEOPOLITICAL MOMENT It is hard to see how America can develop a foreign policy that promotes world stability without a serious engagement of American evangelicals.MeadGalli P44_51 2/4/08 4:03 PM Page 46book, I look at the way the British treated the Irish. You also could look at India,Africa, what happened to the Indians in the U.S., or the Aborigines in Australia. These critiques of the liberal economic and social system are not new. They were being articulated by Catholic critics of Protestant England in France in the 18th century. And you can find writers forNapoleon who sound almost exactly likeNoam Chomsky as they critique the wayEngland's cruel mercantile power depressed the living standards of people in Africa and other parts of the world inorder to maintain England's heartlessglory and wealth. But I look at the results over these hundreds of years, too. What we see is thathuman beings have longer life spans thanthey used to. There are many more possi-bilities for people. The parts of the devel-oping world today that are integratingmost quickly into the system\u2014places likeChina and India\u2014have seen a dramaticrise in living standards and a fall in pover-ty rates. Increasingly people who studydevelopment and work in places like Africa are coming to the conclusion that the greatest problem the poor face is notthe existence of a capitalist economic system, but their lack of access to it. Theidea is not to abolish capitalism andreplace it with something else, but to findways that capitalism can start workingbetter for the poor. That's something that all Americans and especially American Christians needto be thinking a good deal about. Why do you argue that evangelicals have a crucial role to play in this democratic capitalist order? We're seeing now, and have been seeing for the last generation, a remarkable risein the influence and numbers of activeevangelical believers in the U.S., to thepoint where the evangelical vote is a majorfactor in American politics. When wethink about how America can exercise itsresponsibility and develop a foreign policythat works for us, but also works for otherpeople and promotes world stability andpeace\u2014it's hard to see that happeningwithout a serious engagement of Ameri-can evangelicals, especially its intellectu-als. They understand the way conservative ion Pullman didn't want any birthday gifts this year. Instead, he asked his friends and family to donate humanitarian aid \u2014 shoes, to be specific \u2014 to deliver to Buckner International, who in turn distributed them to some of the world's mostneedy \u2014 orphans and at-risk children. Little did he know where his shoes would go. Some of Zion's shoes were distributed to victims of Peru's deadliest earthquake in years, along withblankets, water and food. Others were delivered to Roma, or \"gypsy,\" chil-dren in Tarneveni, Romania, where Bucknerfounded a child development center \u2014 the firstministry of its kind to Roma children outside ofBucharest. Zion's birthday gifts made a difference this year. Maybe he'll get even more presents for his nextbirthday, when he turns 6 years old. A small gesture can go a long way, no matter how old you are, where you live, or how much you can give. If one boy's gift could do all this, imagine what your gift your could do.Simple Gift. Big Change. With Buckner International, you really canchange the world. Gowithus. 4:04 PM Page 47Christians of all stripes instinctively look at certain issues, and can develop anddescribe American foreign policy in ways that make sense to people and can com- mand support. That's part of it. It's also the evangelical commitment to engage in a much deeper way with issues like world poverty. One of the most excit- ing things you are seeing today is theincrease in serious American evangelicalinterest in building new kinds of people-to-people connections, whether it's in Africa or Asia or Latin America\u2014of trying to make a better world for people out there,who increasingly are fellow Christians. More than that, though, one of the great values that the Anglo-Americanworld has brought to world politics is thisidea of faith in the future and optimism, awillingness to embrace change and evenstimulate change to make a better world.But what we see over and over again isthat this tends to turn into postmillennialoptimism, where we're going to be creat- ing utopia now. We need to understand that even if we're not creating utopia now,we still need to persevere in trying tomake the world a better place. It's a rootedand grounded activism in the world thatunderstands and is comfortable with theidea that humanity is imperfect, that per-fection will come only from God, and inGod's time and in God's way\u2014not as the result of human political endeavors. At the same time, that's no excuse to stop politi-cal endeavors to make the world betterand to do a better job. Many have argued that evangelicals are too simplistic or moralistic whenit comes to geopolitics. What makesyou think they now have a construc-tive role to play? Some of these criticisms have been a little unfair at times. Secular people have oftenunderestimated the sophistication andthoughtfulness of religious people. Also,the world of American evangelicals ischanging, making evangelicals a groupthat is more able to exercise the responsi-bilities that are being thrust upon them. For example, I don't think we should underestimate the importance of thechange in American evangelicals' attitudesabout race. Many white evangelicals, par-ticularly in the South, were at one pointamong the most resistant people to racialintegration and equality. That's been dis- carded; you now have a celebration in the American evangelical world of Christian multiculturalism. It's understood thatpeople can be evangelicals while they havea Hispanic or African American or whiteSouthern or Northern suburban culture\u2014 or, for that matter, Kenyan or Malawian or Guatemalan culture. American evangeli-cals today are far better placed to under-stand the kind of world we live in. I finished God and Gold this summer in Rwanda. I was there at Rick Warren'sinvitation to observe what he and Saddle-back Church are doing in Rwanda. TheseSouthern Baptists from Southern Califor- nia were really much better at [avoiding] the colonial sense of superiority or racialbarriers that might have been factors twogenerations ago. These folks were work-ing very hard, and were very comfortablewith the idea of learning to engage withpeople in Rwanda on the Rwandans'terms. And yet most evangelicals across the world\u2014especially Pentecostals\u2014areknown for helping people come into apersonal relationship with JesusChrist, not for a sophisticated under-standing of geopolitics. In terms of creating American soft power, this is extraordinary. If you travel around alot of the developing world, what you see isthe extraordinary progress of Christianmissions and evangelization. Christianity ingeneral leads people in many cases to havevery positive feelings about the UnitedStates and American foreign policy.

Polling evidence shows that in places like Kenya, Nigeria, and other African countrieswhere Christianity has become a veryvibrant presence, people are optimistic about their future; they actually are glad to see American values playing a larger role intheir countries. Or look at Brazil. What is the differ- ence between [America-friendly Presi- dent] Lula, a man who comes out of the Brazilian political left and led a populistcoalition, and Chavez, the Venezuelanleader, who's very anti-American in hisleftist populism? An important part of Lula's coalition is Brazilian Pentecostals and evangelicals. In some of the sameways that in British history the earlyMethodists were a stabilizing politicalforce (arguing for moderation and peace-ful change and opposed to class-strugglepolitics), in Brazil evangelicals have helped to moderate some of the tradition- al left-right divides. At the same time, many Muslims equate Christianity with Americanforeign policy, and their judgment isviolently negative. Exactly right. This is something we have to really be thinking about. I've spent a lot oftime since September 11 in the Islamicworld. I find a tremendous curiosity outthere about the role of evangelicalism and Christianity in general and in American life. Is it anti-Islamic? What does it stand for? Ithink one of the things that we really needto try to promote is a deeper encounterbetween Muslims, especially in the MiddleEast, and American evangelicals. How do your ideas about evangelicals' role in the world fare among your colleagues in foreign affairs? There is a greater acceptance and under- standing. Look at what we're doing at theCouncil on Foreign Relations. People likeRick Warren and Richard Land havebeen elected as life members in the Coun-cil on Foreign Relations. That wouldhave been very unlikely a generation ago,or maybe even 10 years ago. People likethis feel comfortable in a place like thecouncil, and the council feels that theseare the kinds of people who ought to beour members. Here at the council we're trying to open up our events to people in the reli-gious world. I've been running a pro- gram on religion and foreign policy with the help of Tim Shaw, who has a Ph.D.from Harvard and a deep grounding inthe faith community. Richard Haass, ourpresident, has appointed a religiousadvisory board that includes a substan-tial number of evangelicals. We had asymposium last fall on evangelicals andAmerican foreign policy. On the religious side, a lot of people were surprised to find that religious issueswere getting such a sympathetic and seri-ous hearing at a place like the council.

We're finding that things like nuance and subtlety are verymuch a part of the intellectual toolkit that evangelical schol-ars are bringing to their work. There's mutual discovery onboth sides. The secular establish-ment and the evangelical worldhave far more ability to work togeth-er than either one would have predicted five years ago. You say that evangelicals need a strong dose of ReinholdNiebuhr. What do they needfrom Niebuhr and why? Niebuhr's notion of original sin and of America needing to act as a fall-en people in a fallen world is a veryrich concept. He brought originalsin into discussion among people who didn't want to believein a literal interpretation of Genesis. He made the Fallrespectable among mainline Protestants. We are not perfect, and we need to understand that we are not perfect, and that others who are angry at us often havegood grounds for their anger. At the same time, our critics arenot perfect, and to simply say, Whatever they say about us must be right, and so we must do the opposite of what we'vedone \u2014Niebuhr was a very trenchant critic of that thinking. He helps us realize that living in an imperfect world, it's not about building utopia. Niebuhrargued very clearly that the Westernliberal capitalist system wasn't a utopia.Some of the decisions that you makeand things that you do will be wrong;some of the courses you have to followare going to be necessarily imperfectcourses. You're not going to be a hun-dred percent in the right in every warthat you fight. Nevertheless, you have tofight the war. The optimism that is so much a part of the Anglo-American tradition needsto be liberally and frequently salted with Niebuhrian skepticism. At the same time, Niebuhrreminds us that this can't be an excuse for inaction and pas-sivity. We have to be engaged. These ideas can contributeenormously to the intellectual and social formation of a newgeneration of American leaders whose roots are in faithcommunities. 50 C HRISTIANITY TODAY | March 2008OUR GEOPOLITICAL MOMENT ur society still looks a lot like the way British society looked in Queen Anne's reign in the early 18th centu-ry. You had the Puritans, the followers of Cromwell.They still believed that the English Reformationshould end with an England governed by the Bible,which had a detailed pattern for English civil life.[Puritan] Massachusetts's code of laws in the 17thcentury actually provided the scriptural citation thatjustified each enactment of the legislature. Then you had people who were saying that all of this religious stuff is hocus-pocus, that we should guide our acts by pure reason, that weshould have a pure enlightenment society. Then you had people who were saying that we should have tradi- tion; England has a system of government, a monarchy with an aris-tocracy, and our special English way of doing things, and the bestway to run England is to stay loyal to our past. In those days, a lot ofthe tradition people wanted a return of the Stuart royal line. So you had these three groups\u2014Scripture, reason, and tradition\u2014 and none of them could win. It turned out that the country was so divided that it could only be governed by some kind of a weird coalition that didn't always makesense logically, that didn't always make sense scripturally, and ofteninvolved serious departures from tradition. But these three strongpoles in English life ended up producing a kind of a balance of power in the government and in society. In the United States today, you can see the same polarity. There are people who believe that religious revelation provides the surestway for the country to be governed. There are people who say, no,that it should be American populist tradition. And other people, likesecular progressives, say, no, it should be disinterested, pure reasonthat guides us. There are too many evangelicals and conservative Christians in America for our society to disregard their views. There are too manysecular progressives for their views not to have influence. And thereare too many people who have American folk values that are deeplyrooted in American history and popular instincts, and they too can'thelp but influence the way the country works. Conflict is not the same as chaos. It may be that in a fallen world, we need the excesses of each party to be held in check by the otherparties. The idea that the imposition of a single perfect program onthe state and on government, on the country, is the way to perfecthappiness for mankind is an old and constant dream in the world.Given that human beings are fallen and that our reasoning processescan be skewed, our understandings of justice distorted, it may be thatthis kind of open society, which is one of competition and contesta-tion, may over time be the best way for human beings. The secular establishment and the evangelical world have far more ability to work together than either one would have predicted five years ago.

I've gone from working as an aidefor James Dobson, to ministering to maleprostitutes, to making caf\u00e9 lattes at a Chica- go coffee shop. But even that path seems normal considering that once, 12 years ago, I went from serving in media relations at the National Organization for Women, to serv-ing in media relations at Focus on the Fami-ly. Translation: I swallowed the culture andspit out a feminist worldview; then, within ashort period, I swallowed the culture andspit out a conservative Christian worldview.Needless to say, I've wrestled fiercely withworldview and faith. My job as a barista puts me smack dab in the \"real world\"\u2014which to me, meansnotdefending an abortion clinic, leading nonviolent civil-disobedience trainings,stalking an anti-abortion activist at 3 A.M.,or writing a news release on \"BannedBooks Week\" (or Lorena Bobbitt). Nor is itstepping into a college auditorium knowingthat my story of coming to Christ and out ofhomosexuality could elicit tears, laughter, ridicule, and even protests.

Getting to know these women reminds me of the tremendousfriendships I had in the gay andlesbian community. It's also a painful reminder of what I left behind whenI made the decision to follow Christ. In the past eleven years, I've had a proverbial foot in each world, which I'vefound to be both a blessing and a curse. It's ablessing because it helps me err on the sideof grace when dealing with someone with adifferent worldview; the humanity of myideological \"opponent\" is always part of theconversation, so there's an authentic avenueby which to evangelize; and because it helpsme avoid demonizing my past.

(Of course, when I was on stage in alecture hall full of students, it was just me and God standing for truth!) I'm ashamed to say that the most I've mentioned homosexuality in the last seven months was recounting an episode of TheOffice. I've steered clear of anything thatmight link me to my gay/ex-gay past. While at Focus, I counseled often about earning the right to speak into someone'slife before sharing what the Bible has to sayabout homosexual behavior (or any othersin). I also talked about the mandate to loveindividuals, whether or not they came toChrist or changed their behavior. In thepast few years, I've tried to live out thisprinciple. While working with prostitutes,I had the chance to help lead a young manto Christ just before he passed away from AIDS -related cancer. I likely wouldn't have experienced this divine moment had I beathim over the head with his sin. Instead, Ispent time leading him closer to Jesus,meeting practical needs, and helping toshoulder his fear and suffering. So why have I felt reluctant to share the \"ex-gay\" part of my testimony? Am I fallingdown on my job as a Christian?

While I miss thatinfectious faith, I sometimes question the zeal that drove away all my friends from my old life. Iwas a certified freak for Jesuswith no wisdom under my belt.Now I have the wisdom, and pray for the zeal. Then I ended up at Focus on the Family, where I served in the pro-family trenches forseven years. At some point, I began to have a crisis of faith, which didn't fully hit until I leftthe ministry. Questions aboutChristianity and worldview,which had been swirling aroundfor some time, came to the sur-face, creating spiritual confu-sion, darkness, cynicism, anddistance from the One who hadoriginally captured my heart.Blame could be placed on adjust-ing to a radically new worldview,serving in high-profile ministry, and negotiating the loneliness and loss of my old community. I do not believe God made it easy for me to stay connected to him. Then again, I did not perse- vere in some necessary things that mark the life of a maturebeliever: praying daily, meditat-ing on Scripture, and submitting my thoughts and fears to him. I did not put into practice the apostle Paul's admonition to\"demolish arguments and everypretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and . . . take captive every thoughtto make it obedient to Christ\" (2 Cor. 10:5).

She's a shepherd/chow/something mix. And she's near per-fect. One of our joint activities is spendingtime with friends at the Montrose Harbor Dog Beach, a Disneyland for dog lovers. We get together at least five times a weekwith a regular crew (a professional magi-cian, an actress, an artist, a psychologist,and a retired couple). Over time we've become friends, lounging in beach chairs and gossiping about the latest dog-beach news. None of the other members of this group are friendly toward Christianity, yetthey are all curious about my faith. Theyask questions regularly and feel safeenough to poke me about tougher issues. A CHANGING WITNESS Some time ago, I emerged from the dark-ness. In its wake, I found myself thankfulfor seven amazing years of ministry and professional growth in Colorado. I'm grateful for the talented, passionate peo-ple I worked with at Focus, and the manyfaithful friends I still count on. Through the darkness, God confirmed my burden to reach out to those who arestruggling in this world, and to use my giftsand experience to exhort other believers todo the same. He used this period to make me more discerning, more compassionate, and far more aware of the great spiritualneed all around me. To stave off future darkness, I have to continually beat back swirling questions,which are not only unanswerable, but alsonow laden with heavy emotion. I also regu-larly engage in the disciplines that I knowlead to a stronger friendship with God. While I'm not open about my \"check- ered past\" at the coffee shop, I have learnedto shut out the voices of condemnation that tell me I have some divine responsibil- ity to speak out. As staff, we bond over ourbusiness principles, hard work, and theperfect cup of coffee . My changing witness reminds me of something else Paul said: \"To those nothaving the law I became like one not havingthe law . . . so as to win those not having the law. To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all men so that by all possible means I mightsave some. I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings\" (1 Cor. 9:21-23). I do not hide my faith in Christ from Janet, the coffee-shop staff, or my friends atthe beach. It is my hope that they'll noticesomething different about me, continue topoke me with questions, and long to knowthe One who has given me life and hope.

Todd Billings HE TERMS missional and missional church are barely 10 years old, but already they bring up more than half a million hits on a Google search. Churches are inundated with missional books, missional websites,missional consultation groups, and mis-sional speakers. Yet the meaning of the term remains unclear. Some use missional to describe a church that rejects treating the gospel like a com- modity for spiritual consumers; othersframe it as a strategy for marketing the church and stimulating church growth. Some seethe missional church as a refocusing on God's actionin the world rather than obsessing over individuals'needs; others see it as an opportunity to \"meet people wherethey are\" and reinvent the church for postmodern culture. Clearly, we need to examine the range of perspectives hiding under the term missional if we're to make use of insights learned in the missional-church discussion. BACK TO BEGINNINGS A 1998 book titled Missional Church: A Vision for the Sending of the Church in North America was the first workto introduce the concept of a missional church. The multi-authored book grew out of the Gospel and Our Cul- ture Network, a group of professors and pastors that soughtto bring the World Council of Churches' discussions of missio dei (\"the mission of God\") and Lesslie Newbigin's missionary insights to bear on North America. According to Missional Church , the American church had been tied to a \"Christendom model\" of Christianity, wherein the churchfocused on internal needs and maintaining its cultural privi-lege in society. The decline of Christendom provided thechurch an opportunity, they said, to rediscover its identityas a people sent by God into the world as gospel witnesses. Such ideas often provoke resistance. After pastoring a church for several years, a friend of mine started recom-mending changes. Instead of leading the entire service herself, she involved various church members. She also suggested that the church advertise in the yellow pages andthink of ways to reach those without a church home. The response of the church's board of elders surprised her. \"Leading the Sunday service is what we're paying youfor,\" they said. The elders also objected to any attempts tomake the church's life more visible to the community. \"You need to pay attention to ourneeds.\" Although church atten- dance was dropping, the elders were locked into an internal mode, fixated on members' desires rather than on God'sministry in the world. I wish my friend's experience were unusual, but it's not. In response to the perennial problem of self-absorption thatplagues many congregations, the authors of Missional Church emphasized that everything the church ought to be and do is mission: \"Missions\" should not be one church program among many, but the church's core identity as witnesses sent by God into the world. Missional Church authors were not merely \"redesign[ing] the church for success in our changing context,\" or seeking apragmatic \"method and problem solving\" approach to ministry. Instead, they sought to diagnose the culturalcaptivity of today's church, including its obsession with marketing and technique. More importantly, they painted atheologically rooted vision of the church as a communitycalled to participate in God's mission in and for the world. WARNING: CONFUSION AHEAD Since that time, the market machine has spun out manyconflicting definitions of missional church . In general, these definitions share a sense that the church is not primarily about us, but about God's mission. But consensus breaks down over what God's mission is and what it means to participate in it. In many cases, the phrase missional church simply puts new clothes on old trends, such as the seeker-sensitivechurch movement, the church-growth movement, and soon. Often, those critiqued by the authors of Missional Church are now themselves claiming to be missional. For example, church-growth specialists have long wanted churches to create mission statements, so somechurch-growth consultants now claim it is missional to tryto increase the efficiency and effectiveness of ministry. Yet the original meaning of missional church referred to God's mission in the world, not to management advice for accom- plishing our own projects. Indeed, the mission of Goddoesn't fit the formulas of measurable results and effectualoutcomes. It focuses instead on the church living into thecoming reality of God's new creation. For others, the missional impulse has been translated into a consumer-oriented mentality\u2014again, an approach thatOutreachOutreach Freedom from cultural captivity does not mean freedom T WHAT MAKES A CHURCH 56 C HRISTIANITY TODAY | March 2008Missional P56_59 2/1/08 3:18 PM Page authors of Missional Church explicitly reject. Some pas- tors I know are being pressured with missional language to focus their preaching on felt needs. Thus, preaching on \"How to Be a Better Spouse\" or \"How to Be Financially Suc- cessful\" is considered missional, while preaching straightthrough a book of the Bible, a common Reformational prac-tice, is seen as an old habit of Christendom. When our needs set the agenda, how can we learn to embody the gospel that is not just our story, but first and foremost God's? The seek-er-sensitive mentality reflects a profoundly different ecclesi-ology from that of Missional Church, which claims that God's people need to rediscover the centrality of God's action in shaping our witness to the world. Another use of the word missional makes it synonymous with the kingdom of God. This connection is not surprising, as Missional Church speaks about the mission of God as the kingdom of God\u2014something larger than the church ofwhich the church provides a foretaste. Yet this emphasis can become reductionistic. For example, Brian McLaren, one of several Emergent church leaders who self-identify as missional, focuses somuch on the kingdom \"message of Jesus\" in the synopticGospels that he sidelines other scriptural themes. Mostsignificantly, he doesn't take into account that no one can see the kingdom apart from being \"born of the Spirit\" (John 3:1-8), and that the church's identity is centered in the person and proclamation ofJesus Christ (Rom. 6:1-11; Col. 1:24-29). HearingMcLaren and others, the kingdom often sounds likenothing more than a set of ethical activities in whichanyone\u2014Christian, Muslim, or atheist\u2014can partici-pate. The centrality of Jesus Christ himself can beeclipsed by the ethical \"message of Jesus.\" Where-as Missional Church sought to free Scripture from its cultural captivity, some kingdom the-ologies reduce the gospel to a fashionablecultural creed of ethics, inclusion, andsocial action. Certain missional-church authors have also developed a dismissive viewof church history. For example, AlanHirsch claims that from A.D. 313 to 1996, the church was dominatedby a sterile and unbiblical \"Chris-tendom mode.\" Not surprising-ly, thinkers who take approaches like this see most of churchhistory as bereft of valid, externally focused models. (Nevermind the great monastic missionary movements of the Mid-dle Ages, or the bold cross-cultural efforts by people like Matteo Ricci and Francis Xavier.) Among the commonly cited deficiencies of Christendom are the Reformational marks of the church. Allegedly, con- cern for true preaching of the Word and right administra- tion of the sacraments leads to an unhealthy focus on the church's internal life. With the ministry of Word and sacra-ment de-centered for a vague notion of \"mission,\" strangeforms of experimentation can result. For example, in an attempt to be on the cutting edge of being missional, one church recently gave an indis- criminate invitation to baptism. Have you been baptized before, as an infant or an adult? Are you a seeker who has not yet con- fessed the faith? No matter. Come forward, and we will baptize you. By taking the Christendom from tradition. MISSIONAL? BEARD AND HOWELL / THE IMAGE BANKMissional P56_59 2/4/08 4:23 PM Page 57critique of church history to extremes, some churches play into the consumeris-tic mentality that Missional Church decried. Biblical and ecumenical teaching that baptism is a sign of initiation, forinstance, was abandoned in favor of con-temporary hunger for new experiences. Finally, a stream of authors treat the missional church as a kind of magic tonicfor unity that will allow the Americanchurch to overcome doctrinal differences.In L EADERSHIP JOURNAL , Tim Conder suggests that the \"activism\" of missionalchurches can overcome the theological debates and divisions of the past. Like- wise, the editor of The Presbyterian Out-look suggests that being missional is a way to unite mainline Presbyterians and over- come the painful rifts between theological liberals and conservatives. Theologydivides, but mission unites, or so goes themantra. Yet when some Presbyterians think mission involves advocating for peace among world religions by denying the uniqueness of Christ, while others thinkmission involves evangelism of all nations,how escapable is theology? With so many variant views, the term missional church now needs something like an FDA label: Warning: Contradictory and conflicting views of the church inside. MATURING IN MISSION American evangelicals have a history ofambivalence toward the church. We havelong been entrepreneurs for the gospel, starting parachurch ministries that fill in the gaps for local congregations. Theblessing of this has been evangelicalism'svibrancy; the curse, uncertainty aboutwhat the church is and why Christiansshould bother with it. As a young person, I received evange- lism training from a well-known missionsgroup. We were told to speak of Jesus, butto avoid talking about the church. Thechurch has hurt people, after all, and itshistory is littered with stories of oppres-sion and abuse. Unfortunately, this approach to evan- gelism constricts biblical truth. In NewTestament terms, it is impossible tobelong to Jesus Christ without becomingmembers of his body. Salvation neverhappens between just an individual andJesus. When we are united with Jesus,we are simultaneously incorporated intothe church. We don't trust in the churchitself for salvation. But neither do weoverlook its place in the revealed, gospel WHAT MAKES A CHURCH MISSIONAL? Sometimes the phrase missional church simply puts new clothes on old trends, such as the seeker-sensitive and church-growth movements.Missional P56_59 2/1/08 3:29 PM Page God. So how can the missional church over- come its tendencies to domesticate an expansive, biblical vision? Missional Church suggests that Americans first need to look at how their various church tradi- tions can inform a missional identity. We need to ask questions like: What does it mean to be missional and Angli-can/Episcopalian? The Anglican Commu-nion can contribute a rich, liturgical her-itage to the missional church, while a missional vision can maintain such rich liturgy as an instrument for God's kingdom. What does it mean to be missional and Reformed? The Reformed emphasis on the power of God's Word and Spirit cangive the missional church a more fullybiblical theology, while a missional visioncan remind Reformed believers that theWord is sent evangelistically into and forthe world. What does it mean to be missional and Lutheran? The Lutheran tradition's theol-ogy of the Cross can bring a much-neededPauline emphasis to the missionalchurch's theology of the kingdom, while amissional vision can remind Lutherans ofthe centrality of the kingdom reign of God. What does it mean to be missional and Mennonite? The Mennonite tradition of\"the way of Jesus\" can sharpen the mis-sional church's vision of itself, while amissional vision can keep Mennonites cul-turally engaged in God's mission to theworld. A vision for the missional church will push against parts of our historic tradi-tions, just as these traditions will critiqueparts of the missional vision. If we want tohear God's Word in its fullness, we mustrecognize the need for both old and newtraditions. The language of the missionalchurch can be dangerous when it becomesjust another excuse to dismiss the Spirit'swork throughout the vast sweep of churchhistory. Yet thinkers like D. H. Williamsand James K. A. Smith, as well as theancient-future movement (see \"TheFuture Lies in the Past,\" CT, February 2008, p. 22), are helping evangelicals over-come such chronological snobbery. The Holy Spirit has united us not only to Jesus Christ but also to his body, which spansthe globe and history. Thus, we should not be surprised thatGod's new work in mission is also an old work. For we are not shaped primarily by the spirit of the 1950s, the 1990s, or 2008,but by the eternal Spirit, who has beenshaping and sending witnesses to thegospel for thousands of years. J.

Her \"Christian bubble\" dissipated as friends from church got married, and she found herself befriending people with different values: non-Christians, gay students, and pot smokers at the record store where she worked. At university, Amelia took classes on modern American religion. \"That was eye-opening,\" she said. \"I did a lot on JerryFalwell, the conservative party, and the consolidating of theChristian right. It made me question everything I'd been taught.I was raised conservative, pro-life, anti-gay; I was taught thatChristians should be in power. I came out thinking nothing I wastaught had been right.\" When Amelia graduated last December, she told her father she was thinking of going to L'Abri, the Christian study center and commune in the Swiss Alps founded by celebrity apologist Francis Schaeffer. \"When I brought up the idea, Dad said, 'That'sgreat, I love Schaeffer,' \" she said. If her father remembers L'Abri as it was when Schaeffer was alive\u2014a place where thoughtful young Christians went to breathethe fortifying Alpine air and to sit at the feet of their goateedguru\u2014Amelia embodies what L'Abri has become: a community ambivalent about Schaeffer's legacy and ill at ease with main- stream evangelical culture. Half a century after L'Abri's foundingand more than 20 years after Schaeffer's death, students comewith very different questions, and they look askance at the politi-cized faith that Schaeffer helped create. FROM RADICAL TO POLITICO Shortly after Francis and Edith Schaeffer came to Switzerland asPresbyterian missionaries, their eldest daughter, Prisca, began bring-ing college friends home to talk with her father about religion.

The stream of visitors grew,and L'Abri was born. Between L'Abri's 1955 founding and the early 1970s, the ministry attracted European students schooled in modernphilosophy and existentialism, as well as young Americansbackpacking through Europe. \"At that time, you would have founda countercultural temperament at L'Abri,\" said Ronald Wells, pro-fessor emeritus at Calvin College, who visited three times in thelate 1960s. \"You know the old joke\u2014ten ponytails, but only threewomen.\" Once a fundamentalist who worked with Carl McIntire, Scha- effer at this time believed a true Christian spirit demanded that heand Edith welcome into their home\u2014and admit that they might learn from\u2014young people trying to square the Bible withSartre and Kierkegaard. Timothy Leary, counterculturalicon and proponent of LSD's spiritual benefits, visited twice. The atmosphere at L'Abri changed as Schaeffer's profile among evangelical Americans rose. In 1965, Harold O. J. Brown,then minister at Park Street Church in Boston, arranged for Scha-effer to give a series of lectures in the area, followed by a visit toWheaton College. The lectures were unlike anything his audi- March 2008 | C HRISTIANITY TODAY 61TrendsTrends Alpine Dreams: the a lectureon 'The Hiddenness of God.'L'Abri is located in overlooks theRh\u00f4ne Valley.LAbri P60_65 2/1/08 11:45 AM Page had heard before. Using his famous \"line of despair\" diagram to trace thedecline of the West, Schaeffer wove thinkers as diverse as Leonardo da Vinci and Karl Barth into a confident narrative that sought to demolishmodern secular philoso- phy and vindicate Chris- tianity. \"He was talking about [filmmakers] Fellini andBergman when Wheaton required students not to see films,\" said Greg Laughery, L'Abri's current director. Wells recalled,\"We didn't so much listen as levitate.\" Schaeffer's fame grew. He spent more and more time lecturing in America, pub-lished bestselling books, and\u2014when he could get back to Switzerland\u2014enter- tained a flood of fawning pilgrims. By themid-1970s, the dynamic at L'Abri hadchanged radically. \"Students argued quite a bit with him in the early days,\" said John Sandri, whoeventually married Prisca after a mutualfriend invited him to visit the Schaeffers.\"But later, you'd ask a question and get a40-minute monologue. It was just not pos- sible to argue.\" Laughery, who first visited L'Abri in 1980 after a misspent youth in theHaight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, spent his time listening to reel-to-reel recordings of bygone days' lively debates. Most of his peers came to L'Abri not seek- ing healthy debate, he said, but \"to get filledup with apologetic ammunition.\" By this time, some of the young evangeli- cals whom Schaeffer had inspired to pursue the life of the mind had become respected scholars\u2014and had developed a jaundicedview of their old intellectualhero. Those who knew Scha-effer agree that he considered himself an evangelist, not a scholar. \"Schaeffer didn't readbooks,\" said Sandri. \"He gothis material from magazines. Newsweek, Time\u2014he'd take them to the beach. He did go to seminary, too, so he had that. . . . [But] he was out to give broad strokes. It was notnecessary to give you the details of Kierkegaard.\" Many evangelical scholars distanced themselves fromSchaeffer during the last yearsof his career\u2014the time whenhe most fervently demanded their loyalty. Beginning in the early 1970s,Schaeffer began to make connections withconservative politicians. The 1973 Roe v.Wade decision pushed him further. In 1974, his son, Frank, persuaded him to col- laborate on a documentary film series con- ceived as a Christian answer to KennethClark's Civilisation \u2014a series that would depict legalized abortion as the final act in the West's moral erosion. Following the massive suc- cess of the series How ShouldWe Then Live? , Schaeffer con- tinued his pattern of cutting scholarly corners and reshap-NOT YOUR FATHER'S L'ABRI Authenticity is far more important to today's L'Abri students than winning debates with secular intellectuals.

In the early 1980s, he hired John White-head, founder of the Christian libertarian Rutherford Institute, to research a book about the Christian foundation of America.The result was a historically dubious buthighly influential volume entitled A Christ- ian Manifesto (1981). Schaeffer was outraged by evangelical historians' refusal to support the book'sclaim that the Founding Fathers had acted out of explicitly Christian moti- vations. \"He had written as atract in the culture wars.\" Schaeffer continued lectur- ing and writing against abortion and Chris-tian political apathy until his death in 1984.Workers and family members at L'Abriworried about the political turn that their leader's career had taken. \"I talked to Schaeffer about his cobelligerency withthe Moral Majority,\" said Laughery, whohas of Fribourg. \"From my perspective, thatwas a mistake.\" There was little trace of the open-mind- ed, countercultural Schaeffer that had enter-tained flocks of skeptical hippies in decadespast. By the 1980s, he had little tolerance foranyone who deviated from his notion ofChristian orthodoxy. When John Sandri'sstudies in literature led him to reread theBible through the lens of narrative theology,Schaeffer was appalled. \"He wanted me towithdraw from a teaching role in the com-munity,\" said Sandri, who is bronzed andwiry at 71, thanks to hishobby of long-distanceAlpine running. Sandri hadcome to question everything from the Trinity to predesti- nation, \"but the one thatbroke the camel's back was[biblical] inerrancy. Schaef-fer felt this was the issue of the day, where Christians have to dig into the trenches,\" Sandri said. \"I'm not an inerrantist, butI'm not an 'errantist' either. Both are wrong. Man makes these opposing points ofview. The modernist agendais behind both.\" Sandri, who still lives at L'Abri with his wife, callshimself a \"radical.\" Twenty-three years after Schaeffer'sdeath, his unorthodox viewsare a telling expression ofwhat L'Abri has become. RECOVERING EVANGELICALS To reach L'Abri, I rode a train along the coast of Lake Geneva to the winery townof Aigle, where I caught abus into the mountains. After a stomach-lurching ride along switchback roads, thebus deposited me in front of an imposing chalet built of dark pine andwhite stucco. Geraniums hung over theporch railings beneath the second and third-floor windows. Laundry fluttered on clothes-lines. Down the mountain, smaller chalets sat nestled between vegetable gardens and cow pastures. On that clear afternoon, I could see miles across the valley to moun- tains whiskered with snow. I met Chris Martin over supper on the first night of fall term. A lanky 23-year-oldwhose hair hung in a shaggy curtain overhis eyes, Chris first heard of L'Abri duringhis junior year at the University of SouthCarolina, when a L'Abri worker came tospeak. Like Amelia, Chris had felt paralyzedby expectations at home. His leadershiprole in Campus Crusade left him no time tosort out his spiritual doubts. When he gothere last spring, Laughery recommendedthat he read Schaeffer's He Is There and HeIs Not Silent (1972). Chris wasn't impressed. \"Schaeffer seemed to make a ton of assump- tions, and he didn't back up many,\" Chris said. \"It was too didactic.\" Neither Amelia nor Chris knew exactly what they wanted out of their experience atL'Abri, but they had a word for it: \"authen- ticity.\" That idea is far more important to today's L'Abri students than winningdebates with secular intellectuals or strate-gizing to overturn Roe v. Wade. Though most hold firmly to conservative social val-ues, they resent the assumption that theirfaith is chained to a prescribed political position. As Amelia said, \"I don't want to be a white American girl who votes for Bush.\" The personal spiritual quest has always been a priority for those who come toL'Abri. The daily routine has changed littleover the years, a combination of commu-nal interaction and private study meant tofacilitate personal growth. Chores occupy half of each day, and students spend the other half reading and listening to record-ed lectures at Farel House, the clapboardchalet that serves as L'Abri's chapel andhouses a modest library. There, studentshunch over tables and lean against theledge of the stone fireplace in the wood-paneled room, adjusting their headphonesand taking notes. In cold weather, FarelHouse is drafty, and they wrap themselvesin blankets. In the summertime, they pulltheir chairs onto the balcony, prop theirfeet on the railing, and watch the moun-tains over the edges of their books. Alumni from decades past who have visited recently say they notice a change.\"The people here when I've been visitingare not as serious,\" said Kyle McCormick,who first came in 1982. Of course, every-one seems to believe that L'Abri was at itsbest when they were there. The faddishintellectualism of L'Abri's earliest yearsmust be taken with a grain of salt. But cur-rent workers agree that, as Laughery put March 2008 | C HRISTIANITY TODAY 63 A New Director: Greg Laughery came to L'Abrias a student in 1980.Practical community life(such as hanging AM Page 63it, \"the emphasis has shifted to personal issues, which people less readily see asrelated to ideas.\" The workers, who meet with students one-on-one each week to guide their stud-ies, struggle to pull them out of their ownheads. \"For a lot of people, [L'Abri] is more about personal spirituality, which makes sense\u2014that's the way religion is branded inthe U.S.,\" said Jasie Peltier, a tall blondefrom Houston who became a Christian atL'Abri when she came four years ago. Pelti- er tutors mostly female students, and though she'd prefer to talk about philosophy andtheology, she usually ends up talking aboutboys. \"No one has a clue what 'authenticity'is,\" she said. \"They think it's spilling your guts, purging. They think, I'm going to be real here, and being real means sharing,over-sharing.\" In the evenings, studentscrowd into the small office on the first floor,which houses a single computer open foruse after dinner. They squeeze onto thefuton and sit cross-legged on the floor, swapping stories about past romances, crushes, and relationships gone sour. Workers say this slumber-party atmos- phere often fades a month or so after thestart of each term, as students settle in andbegin to confront their real reasons for tak-ing several months off from school or workto come to L'Abri. Between peeling pota-toes, hacking at weeds, and laughing through volleyball games on the grassy court overlooking the valley, studentsexplore their faith (or lack of it\u2014the occa-sional atheist finds his way here) by meansvery different from the apologetics ofFrancis Schaeffer. Those few students whohave read any of his books consider himlargely obsolete. The modernist philosophythat he targeted in most of his writings, thebogeyman of existentialism, is pass\u00e9. \"Nowthe question is, Is there truth at all?\" saidworker Thomas Rauchenstein, a soft-spo-ken Canadian with sandy brown hair and aclose-cropped beard. \"Postmodernism'scritique of truth is more of a factor in stu-dents' thinking.\" During one lunch at L'Abri, Rauchen- stein led a discussion of biblical inerrancyover ham sandwiches on homemade bread(despite its meager budget of 2 SwissFrancs per person, per meal, L'Abri feedsvisitors well). Students hunched forwardin their chairs. They offered ideas aboutwhat it meant to interpret theBible literally or call Scriptureinerrant. Some strayed intofairly liberal territory; a quietPresbyterian boy sittingacross from me, fresh out ofSoutheastern Bible College,looked stricken. No one, however, challenged the idea that the central events of the Gospels areliterally true. Indeed, a few of the studentstold me afterward that they wished moreatheists were around, like in the old days.Rachel Davies, 23, a Seventh-day Adven-tist from Washington State who heardabout L'Abri from a pastor who came inthe 1970s, said expected \"a back-packer atmosphere and hippies. . . . When I walked in, I was taken aback by all the Christian people. I saw the crosses dan-gling around their necks, and I thought,This will be different from what I expected .\" Though they sometimes come seeking debate, students and workers today have nouse for Schaeffer's presuppositionalist apolo- getics, which he adapted from the teachings of his professor at Westminster TheologicalSeminary, Cornelius Van Til. Van Til's aim\"was to show the non-Christian that his worldview in toto and in all its parts must logically lead back to full irrationalism, and then to show him that the Christian systemprovides the universal which gives a validexplanation of the universe. \"It is Christianity or nothing,\" Schaeffer explained in a 1964lecture at L'Abri. He believedthat Christian could but onlybecause nonbelievers' world-views were inconsistent. With- out realizing it, Schaeffer believed, theyoperated from uniquely Christian presup-positions, such as universal morality, anorderly universe, and ultimate meaning in life.

Convincedthat they won't find it intellectually, manypursue that feeling of conviction throughexperience: in the communal life and wor- ship at L'Abri; in the books by emerging church authors that arepopular with many students, andin the charismatic worship style,that\u2014though Pentecostals havenever been a significant presence\u2014is no longer taboo here. UNCERTAIN LEGACY L'Abri's remote location has always provid-ed a haven for Christians who feel exhaustedby the culture that raised them. To CharlieHamill, a blond 31-year-old who wanted abreak after a decade of post-col- lege bartending in Missouri, L'Abri offered an opportunity to\"get away from American life\u2014theculture of 'I've got to have every-thing and be doing everything,'\"he said. Nichole Mick, culture,\" she said. \"One of the worst timesin my faith was at aChristian university. You see a lot of phoniness. . . . We go to church, do thehandshake, smile, butinside we don't know.\" Even during his final years, Schaeffer remain-ed a critic of mainstream evangelicalism, which he considered unconscionably apathetic. But the political action that he advocated turns off most current L'Abri stu-dents, and the workers are pointedly critical of American culture and national policy. They try to awaken students to the underly- ing assumptions that frame how they see the world, just as Schaeffer did, and toexplore the arts and sciences without wor-rying that such realms are \"anti-Christian.\" \"I don't necessarily agree with [Schaef- fer],\" said George Diepstra, whotaught biology courses at North-eastern Illinois University in Chicago before retiring to L'Abri to work with students. \"Heopened doors for us to engagewith culture more, but I'm notsure he often did it himself.\"A quarter-century after the death of its charismatic founder, during a new era inwhich\u2014largely due to Schaeffer's influence\u2014L'Abri is far from the only or the best placefor a budding Christian intellectual to go, the peculiar Alpine retreat is unsure of its role. For one thing, it is not the sole arbiter of Schaeffer's legacy. Shortly afterL'Abri was founded, Schaeffer'sdaughter Susan and her husband,Ranald Macaulay, established abranch outside of Cambridge, Eng-land. More recently, L'Abris have popped up as far afield as Massachusetts, Sweden, and Korea. Members of the L'Abri Fellowship are far from agreement on theirobligations to their heritage. Laughery, who was cagey on the subject, implied that other branches have remainedmore conservative. Shortly after Schaeffer'sdeath, the family divided over leadership ofthe original L'Abri: Prisca's younger sisterDeborah and her husband, Udo Middel- mann, left to found the Schaeffer Founda- tion across the valley in Gryon, Switzerland.They have told mutual acquaintances that\"our theology is bad,\" said Prisca. \"Theythink John [Sandri] doesn't believe ininerrancy the way they do\u2014but I knowthey've liberalized on some things, too.\" The staff would like to believe that L'Abri is \"ahead of culture, the vanguard, alight to Christians,\" said Greg Laughery.But they admit that their community is amarginal place: a safety valve for the fewwho find their way to it. \"L'Abri will con-tinue to exist as long as the evangelicalchurch is putting off so much of its youth,\"said Sandri. \"Ninety percent of the studentsare [saying]: I believe all the right things,but there's no reality to my faith.\" Molly Worthen, a New Haven, Connecticut- based writer, is working on a book about evangelical intellectual life.ctNOT YOUR FATHER'S L'ABRI Those few students who have read any of Schaeffer's books consider him largely obsolete. C HRISTIANITY TODAY 65Students Old and New: Former staffmember L'Abri PriscaSchaeffer. PM HRISTIANITY BEEN a full quarter- century since the long-haired clergyman with the ukulele drilled the church's children in singing, \"God is a surprise, rightbefore your eyes, God is a sur-prise.\" But the words stayed with me because, now as then, they match my own vivid experience. The high spots of my life present them- selves in retrospect as a series of surprises\u2014happy surprises, from the hand of a verygracious God. Is that unusual? I doubt it.But I also doubt that we dwellon the happy surprises as oftenand as thoughtfully as we should.There is great wisdom in the elderly chil-dren's chorus, \"Count your blessings\u2014name them one by one\u2014and it will surprise you what the Lord has done.\" Recently, at only a few minutes' notice, I realized that I was expected to reply to some kind things being said about me by saying something personal and alsodevotional. Off the cuff I listed some of thehappiest of the happy surprises that havecome my way, and the story came out more or less as follows. It was a happy surprise when God made me a Christian, after two years during which I had kidded myself that Iwas one already, since I went to churchand argued at school for the truth of theApostles' Creed. Jesus Christ broke intomy life, claimed me as his own, and mademe a different person, all in the space ofabout 20 minutes during the second half ofan evangelistic sermon. I remember theexperience as if it were yesterday. At thetime it was a shattering surprise, but happy is my word for it now. Happy too is my word today for the surprise of realizing, about a year after myconversion, in my second year at university,that God was calling me to a life of ministry,as an undershepherd for his sheep. Being inthose days an odd person, somewhat solitaryand, as I thought and felt, very poor at MeditationMeditationICount Your PackerSurprise P66_67 2/1/08 4:04 PM Page 66cthuman relationships, I fought the call, but God\u2014I have to use the word\u2014overpowered me, telling me I must trust himand go ahead. It was unnerving at the time, but God knew what he was doing, and my call to shepherd souls has shaped my life's activities throughout. I had arranged to go straight on to seminary in Oxford, where I was already studying. But it proved to be anotherhappy surprise when in the final term of my first degree, having suddenly found in myself a strong desire to get away from Oxford for a time, I was in effect drafted out of theblue as a supply teacher of Latin, Greek, and philosophy\u2014my degree subjects\u2014to spend a year in a theological schoolin London. There, I found I had a gift for teaching adultsand a passion for educating ministers, and I went back to Oxford knowing that educational work of that kind would be central in fulfilling my pastoral call. Then, shortly before my ordination to a parish, I met a young lady at a retreat that neither of us by rights shouldhave been at. Two days and one sleepless night later, Iknew we were meant for each other, and soon she knew it too. Looking back over our 55 years together, I declare that this was God engineering another of his wonderfully happysurprises; but this is not the place to celebrate that further. Soon came the happy surprise of becoming a published author. Asked to write up a talk at pamphlet length, six orseven thousand words perhaps, I struggled for a year andboldly, perhaps bumptiously, came up with a book of sixtythousand: Fundamentalism and the Word of God , which is still in print half a century later. Its success showed me thatwriting must henceforth have a central place in the educa-tional work through which I sought to fulfill my pastoralcall. The further happy surprise of finding that when Iturned some magazine articles into the book Knowing God,it became a nurturing tool for the Christian world, servedonly to confirm this. The final surprise in this story was to be \"headhunted,\" as we say nowadays, by my oldest Oxford friend, JamesHouston, to join the faculty of Regent College, Vancouver, ofwhich he was the founder-principal. Nothing was furtherfrom my mind at that time than leaving England, despitesome awkwardnesses there, and I had already turned downsome invitations to relocate. But Principal Houston'sapproach led to a move into a situation in which I have spent, beyond all question, the best 28 years of my life so far. Finding that God was calling me to do what I can do as aBritish immigrant in Canada\u2014British by genes, now Canadi-an by choice, as I sometimes express it\u2014was startling, buthas proved to be yet another of God's very happy surprises. These were the turning points in my life that I reeled off to illustrate the truth that believers serve a God ofhappy surprises, which is what I sought to tell the meeting.Straight after I had finished, the program required us all tosing \"All the Way My Savior Leads Me.\" Victorian hymns rarely do much for me (I am a Watts, Wesley, and Newton man), but, having through my own fault had to formulate on the fly and wing it verbally, and having, I thought, been helped in doing this, these words came as so true a theo- logical interpretation of what I had just been through and the 63 years as a Christian that I had been talking about,that my heart was squeezed and I was almost in tears. Initself, the moment was yet another happy surprise, thistime one of unexpected divine confirmation. Paul, discipling converts, harps constantly on the virtue, duty, and (by implication) blessing of constant giv-ing of thanks to God. \"Be filled with the Spirit . . . alwaysgiving thanks to God the Father for everything\" (Eph. 5:18, 20). \"So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him, rooted and built up in him . . . andoverflowing with thankfulness\" for this is God's will for you in ChristJesus\" (1 Thess. 5:18). Paul himself, in all his hardships,found matter for repeated thanksgiving in the privilege ofhis own ministry (1 Tim. 1:12-14), in the work of grace thathe saw through his evangelism, and in the churches'ongoing life. Glum Christians who say they have not much to give thanks for are wrong. Some of the specifics of my experi-ence, narrated above, are no doubt peculiar to me, but Icannot believe that the quality of my experience is in anyway special. So I say: Look for the happy surprises, for theywill help you to keep expressing proper gratitude to Godall your days. J. I. Packer is a senior editor for C HRISTIANITY TODAY.

PackerGETTY IMAGESPackerSurprise P66_67 2/1/08 4:05 PM Page 67N A SMALL thrift store tucked next to a motel near a California interstate, Will wrestles a duct-taped vacuum cleaner out of itsbox. He has worked at the thrift store for two months\u2014the same amount of time that he's beensober and has lived at the InsideOut Men's Home, a rehabilitationcenter for chronic alcohol anddrug abusers. Will speaks carefully about the decisions he made before comingto Inside Out. \"I chose alcohol over her,\" he says, when asked about hisgold wedding band. \"But I never touchedher. I never did that.\" \"She said she didn't want to see me anymore,\" he adds.\"But she hasn't moved or changed herphone number.\" Will has kids, too\u2014and hope for getting his life back on track. Main Place Christian Fellowship, which operates the thrift store in Tustin, Califor-nia, and the rehabilitation center in nearbySanta Ana, traffics in the hope that encour-ages Will to try to change his life. As a plantof Saddleback Church 20 years ago, MainPlace's ministry has burgeoned, plantingseven churches of its own and expecting tobirth a dozen more by 2020, says pastorRich Mathisrud. As a church planter, MainPlace spends much of its time running busi-nesses to locate and serve the downtrodden. Its church-planting abilities surprisingly come from starting nonprofit businesses. \"We want to use resources to reach as many people as possible,\" says Mathisrud.\"We're just a little church with a big visiontrying to honor our great God.\" In two decades, Main Place has started a total of six businesses in Orange County and planted seven churches.Its businesses include thethrift store, half of which sells office supplies; a bookstore; an elementaryschool; and two theaters, Curtain Call Dinner Theater and, most recently, the Village Theater. Its seven churches arescattered across the West Coast in Tustin,Irvine, Orange, Garden Grove, Santa Ana, and Los Angeles, California, and in Tijuana, Mexico. Main Place's businesses invest inalcohol- and drug-addicted men to providethe finances necessary for church planting and community work; then it puts its prof- its back into some of the most crime-filledcommunities in the county. Is this any way to run a church? Actually, it is. SETTING THE TREND The Christian Community DevelopmentAssociation ( CCDA ), whose main offices are located in Chicago, is the guiding organiza-tion for Main Place and 600 similar effortsin 200 cities and 40 states across the coun-try. The named \"grandfather\" of CCDA is longtime social-justice worker John M.Perkins (see \"Grandpa John,\" CT, March 2007). Since the 1960s, Perkins and hiswife, Vera Mae, have served the poor intheir Mississippi backyard and elsewhere,eventually helpingfound the CCDA in 1989. \"We champion a to thegospel,\" Perkins says,quoting James's in-junction to \"visit the 68 C HRISTIANITY TODAY | March 2008Church GrowthChurch Growth Thinking Outside the Church: As acommunity once paid agas station to offer12,000 gallons ofgas for 40 centsless than the going rate.

The ultimate goal of the association, Perkins says, is to follow\"the Great Commandments and the GreatCommission\"\u2014to love God and neighborby bringing the gospel of one to the other at the grassroots level. In obedience to this goal, a CCDA organization may or may notplant a church, but it will likely start one or morebusinesses to fuel com- munity outreach and growth. Main Place manages to do both. Pastor Mathisrud says the church wasn't tryingto start a business, let alone six; it justwanted to help. A burly man named Dave, with tattoos up one arm anddown the other, operates Main Place's thrift store. As amanager, Dave has already finished the Inside Out reha- bilitation program; in Main Place parlance, he's a graduate. The thrift store and the men's home function symbiot-ically: the residents of the latter are often employed at the former. Proceeds from theshop, added to profits fromMain Place's small bookstore and elementary school, cover the cost of feeding and hous-ing a dozen men at a time. Inside Out sits on two adja- cent parcels in a residentialarea of Santa Ana. Officially,it's a \"loving care\" facility\u2014acity term, Mathisrud says. Residents pay nothing to live there, but like Will, they may work at the thrift store. Mathisrud says it costs $7,500 a year to support each resident, depending on medicaland dental coverage and poten-tial court fees. The men in the program commit to one year ofresidency. By the time they graduate, they will have saved at least$1,000 and are ready to go out on theirown. But many who complete the pro- gram stay on at the thrift storeand help new residents. One Inside Out graduate bought a carpet-cleaning busi-ness from the church and nowpastors Main Place's churchplant in Garden Grove.

Founder Elizabeth Howardhad turned the theater into a Tustin institution before she retired. Mathisrud good-naturedly pestered Howard for years to let him hold a Sunday brunch at the theater, and she steadfastly refused.But when she retired, Howard finally sold Mathisrud the theater. Having a church run the city's beloved theater worried some patrons. When the theater changed hands in 2005, Curtain Callcontinued its standard dinner fare, but no longer served beer andwine. \"As a church, we felt we couldn't serve alcohol when the reason we're doing plays is to help men addicted to it,\" Mathisrud says. Adele Hirschfield and her husband, Lewis, often attended plays prior to Main Place taking the reins. Since then, theHirschfields went twice\u2014and enjoyed it. \"The show was just asgood as ever and the meal was excellent,\" she says. \"The servicewas fine.\" Recently Main Place leased a second venue in nearby Orange. The Village Theater may become the new meeting place for PastorRich's congregation. It will also produce plays\u2014\"Everything Bibli-cal to Broadway,\" as a banner over the theater's sign proclaims.Main Place is renovating the new site and has a 10-year lease.

It's large and sturdy enough tohold the sins of those who write their confessions on pieces of paper and nail them to the wooden beams. Write your sins on the paper, nail them to the cross, and walk away. \"It's for anybody who comes in,\" says Doug Hellman, a store employee. \"It's loud, too. You get one person nailing, and pretty soon you've got a line of people.\" Hellman says the thrift store is an \"ideal spot\" for outreach because of the motel that surrounds it\u2014a hotbed of drug dealing and prostitution. \"This place needs a police substation,\" he says.\"It can be bad. We see it all the time.\" Hellman himself stayed in the motel the week before he came to Christ and started living at the men's home. But in spite of the neighborhood, or perhaps because of it, \"it's perfect for us,\" Hellman says. \"They shop here, and we get achance to witness to them.\" This is Christian community development in microcosm, as it plays out on one 100-yard stretch of road in one town in OrangeCounty and in the lives of individuals like Will, whose simplework in the thrift store speaks of his hope to put his life backtogether.

ROWAN WILLIAMS , Open to Judgement [T]HE GOSPEL ACCOUNTS were all written \"on this side of Easter.\"That is to say, early followers ofJesus, including the authors of theGospels, had the benefit of looking back on an event and seeing in it the working of God. In addition to thecross being an act of human treach-ery and brutality, they were able tosee the crucifixion of Jesus as alsoGod's act. The crucifixion was viewed not only as an act of hostilityon the part of human beings towardGod's messenger, but also an act ofimmeasurable love on the part of the one who had sent that messenger. THOMAS R. Y ODER NEUFELD , Recovering Jesus CHRIST 'S DEATH doesn't replace our death. It enacts it, [the apostle Paul] suggested. That's what theolo- gians call inclusive substitution. Because one has died, all have died.As a substitute, he is not a thirdparty. His death is inclusive of all. . . .What happened to him happened tous. When he was condemned, we were condemned. When he died, we died. We were included in his death. MIROSLAV VOLF , Free of ChargeGOD 'S VERDICT reversed the world's judgment.

But really, one can only store so much Fun Foam in a single house. Still, there was one piece of art I was compelled to save. My daughter had cut out and colored pictures of children engaged in different acts of worship, and glued them onto a sheet. (She was three; you were expecting decoupage?) Bethany had been particularly proud of this assignment because of the gluing part. (I think she may have a future in adhesives.) The day she brought it home, I acknowledgedthe excellence of the glue-work and thenasked her to tell me what the pictures repre-sented. \"Praying! Giving! Reading the Bible!\"she shouted as I pointed to each scene. I saved the best picture for last\u2014a boy with his mouth open wide in song. Singing ismy favorite form of worship. I knew it wouldbe Bethany's too, what with her mother beinga singer and all. \"Laughing,\" said Bethany, when I pointed to the boy with the open mouth. I stood corrected. Laughing is my favorite form of worship. I've been backing up my laughter-as- worship theory for a while now, collecting various quoteson the matter. I was recently compelled to stop readingAnne Lamott's Plan B long enough to shout \"Yes!\" (com- plete with fist-pump), and scribble this airplanenapkin: \"Laughter is carbonated holiness.\" And anyonewho knows me will understand why I give a hearty amen to this bit of wisdom from Woody Allen: \"I am thankful forlaughter, except when milk comes out of my nose.\" (In mycase, there was an unfortunate incident involving DietCoke, and the memory of it gives poignancy to the idea oflaughter as carbonated holiness.) But my favorite quote may be this one from Karl Barth: \"Laughter is the closest thing to the grace of God.\" Ofcourse, Barth must have meant the good kind of laughter,born from joy or relief or the sweet surprise of community.There is also derisive laughter, rooted in pettiness or vulgar-ity or cruelty. It's not hard to tell the redemptive kind\u2014laughter that is reflexive, even involuntary worship\u2014fromthe destructive kind. Laughter can change and grow, and sometimes it changesand grows us. Consider the laughter of Abraham's Sarah,blossoming from incredulity into incredible joy. When Sarahhad a baby at long, impossible last, she named him Isaac\u2014 which means, of course, \"laughter.\" A good laugh is a release\u2014even if only for a moment\u2014 from worry, strife, and self. It is a sudden, often unbidden confession that someway, somehow, all is well, or at least there is a hope that it can be. It's telling that we talk about \"gales\" of laughter. We instinctively recognize that laughter belongs to the world of wind, or Spirit\u2014unexpected joy arrives on the gust of a fresh current and carries us to a different placefrom the one where it found us. That is whyI suspect that Lamott is right\u2014that laughteris holiness, that it is part of the life of God,and that to laugh from your belly is to wor- ship the Giver of all good gifts. Trinitarian theologians use the word peri- choresis to describe the happy fellowship of the Father, Son, and Spirit. Their relationship is often pictured as a tireless and joyful divinedance. I can't think about that holy dancewithout remembering certain jigs that havebeen known to take place in our family room.(For shy, repressed, reserved, uncoordinated, Canadian Baptists, we can really cut a rug.) When our kidswere toddlers, my husband, Mark, and I would twirl and spinthem until they were helpless with laughter so hard it wassoundless, and then we would laugh at them laughing until wewere all worn out with gladness. If we'd have thought of it, wecould have quoted the psalmist as we held our aching sides onthe family room floor: \"Our mouths were filled with laughter,our tongues with songs of joy. . . . The LORD has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy\" (Ps. 126:2-3). It's serious business, laughter. It's the kind of sacrifice of praise that puts our insides right. The old clich\u00e9 is true:Laughter is a medicine that reminds us that our sickness willone day be healed and we shall be whole and holy. Until then,laughter is the Elmer's Glue that attaches us to the goodnessthat inhabits this world, and to the gladness that hints at theworld to come.

I don't know.\" While Osteen later apologized for seemingly downplaying the necessity of faith in Christ for salvation, the pluralisticpressure to waffle on this issue is intense. Several mainlinedenominations support a two-covenant theology, which holdsthat Judaism and Christianity are paral-lel, divinely guided paths to God. In addi-tion, in 2002 the U.S. Conference ofCatholic Bishops released a document,\"Reflections on Covenant and Mission,\"affirming that \"Jews already dwell in a saving covenant with God.\" Noting that many church leaders and theologians have \"retreated from embracing the task of evan- gelizing Jews,\" in 1989 a global group of evangelical theolo-gians (including Vernon Grounds, Kenneth Kantzer, J. I.Packer, and Tokunboh Adeyemo) drafted the WillowbankDeclaration on the Christian Gospel and the Jewish People.They denied that \"any non-Christian faith, as such, will medi- ate eternal life with God.\" Such a statement, attacked when it was released, remains politically incorrect. Voices both inside and outside the church say that evangelizing Jewish people\u2014calling them torepent of their sins and trust in Jesus Christ as their Lord,Savior, and Messiah\u2014is inappropriate. Rabbi David Rosenrecently told CTthat if someone relates to him \"as someone who's going to burn in hell, then I can't really see that as genuine love toward my people and my faith.\" I love and respect the Jewish people and their faith. After all, Jesus was a Jew, and Christianity is firmly rooted in theHebrew Scriptures. Certainly the Holocaust and the church'shorrific anti-Semitism have changed the context for evange-lism. We have much for which to apologize. But we cannotapologize for the gospel, which is Good News for Jewish peo-ple precisely because they\u2014like all human beings\u2014needJesus. Paul, a Hebrew of Hebrews, said plainly, \"What then?Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For . . . all, bothJews and Greeks, are under the power of sin.\" Some believe that Romans, which states emphatically that \"all Israel will be saved,\" teaches that Jews do not need tohear the Good News from us. (Along those lines, Rosen asks evangelicals to \"suspend your proselytizing and allow the Almighty to do whatever the Almighty thinks is the thing todo in his own time.\") Such interpretations remind me of theapocryphal story of the misguided churchman who conde-scendingly told budding missionary William Carey, \"Young man, sit down; when God pleases to convert the heathen, he will do it without your aid and mine.\" If Carey had sat down,the modern missionary movement might have died stillborn. Ordinarily God uses people to spread his message. Good news is no news at all if it is not commu-nicated. And it must be shared first with the Jews (Rom. 1:16). Their calling asGod's covenant people makes our evan-gelistic obligation to them greater, notless. \"The biblical hope for Jewish peo-ple,\" Willowbank says, \"centers on theirbeing restored through faith in Christ to their proper place as branches of God's olive tree, fromwhich they are at present broken off.\" Some people denigrate the methods and motives of peo- ple who evangelize Jews. They claim that focusing ministryon\u2014or \"targeting\"\u2014Jews is just plain wrong. \"Billy Grahamdidn't target Jews,\" pastor John Hagee says. \"Bill Brightrefused to target the Jews. I'm not targeting the Jews.\" Others charge that those who evangelize Jewish people are deceptive or are attempting to snare the vulnerable in the Jewish community. These would include students, the aged, Russian Jews, the impoverished, those from dysfunc-tional or interfaith families, and the uneducated. Strangely, other types of focused evangelism\u2014such as among students or the homeless\u2014seem to be acceptable. AsWillowbank correctly notes, \"The existence of separatechurchly organizations . as an appropriate means of fulfilling the church'smandate to take the gospel to the whole human race.\" Of course, deception and manipulation are always wrong. The ends do not justify the means when it comes to evange-lism. Rick Warren of Saddleback Church has rightly toldJewish audiences that he doesn't believe in coercion\u2014though he does believe in persuasion. So must we. As we continue the good works of dialogue and practical ministries among our Jewish neighbors, let'srenew our commitment to also sensitively but forthrightlypersuade them to receive the Good News. ctWhy Evangelize the Jews? God's chosen people need Jesus as much as we do.FOOLISH THINGS STAN GUTHRIE We have much for which to apologize. But we cannot apologize for the gospel.

In any event, D'Souzaadmirably separates the stickum from thearguments. Consider Hitchens's complaint that \"religion poisons everything.\" This wildswing places bin Laden, the pope, and Mar-tin Luther King Jr. on equal footing. D'Souzaanswers on behalf of Christianity. Hedescribes how Christian principles of freechoice and human dignity laid the ground-work for democratic political systems built on inalienable human rights. They inspired free markets in economics and intellectualpursuit. Christian theologians fathered mod-ern science. The world even now takes forgranted America's uncommon generosity,especially in times of disaster and crisis.These traits spring directly from our faith. D'Souza also refutes the common charge that Christianity has unleashed humankind'smost murderous impulses. The most-citedatrocities are either overblown or misrepre-sented: the Inquisition claimed 2,000 livesover three and a half centuries. The Salemwitch trials produced fewer than 25 execu-tions. Recent wars\u2014the Israel-Palestine conflict, Iraq, and Northern Ireland\u2014stem mostly from ethnic and political discord.While atrocities violate Christian doctrine,they're of a piece with atheism\u2014whichlargely bears responsibility for the bloodiestcentury in history. D'Souza takes up a second major tenet of the New Atheism\u2014that religion and science cannot coexist. He defangs Darwinists by demon- strating the compatibility of evo- lutionary theory and Christian doctrine, and reiterates Aquinas's assertion that reason and faith complement each other. Yet science has insurmount- able limits. It cannot answer empirical questions about the origins of the universe, for instance. D'Souza quotes Nobel March 2008 | CHRISTIA NITY TODA Y 79This is a more difficult task than one might expect: Atheist works tend to combine argu-ment with large doses of bitter biography.Every chapter of Dawkins's book, forinstance, describes unpleasant encounterswith believing dolts\u2014hate-mail writers, Jeho-vah's Witnesses, and the like. Hitchens recallsmurderous fanatics in Bosnia, Afghanistan, and the Levant, and his blood-chilling encounters with a childhood schoolmarm. While the chief atheists write beautifully, their works share a telling defect. They seethewith disapproval of God. Dawkins capturesthis trend in describing the YHWH of the Old Testament as \"arguablythe most unpleasant character inall fiction: jealous and proud of petty, D'SOUZA IS SKEPTICAL OF SKEPTICISM AND ENTHUSI- ASTIC ABOUT THE FAITH. by T ony Snow \u00bbThere are two types of Christian apologetics. One makes the positive case for faith; the other responds to critics. Dinesh D'Souza's delightful book, What's So Great About Christianity /pentastar2/pentastar2/pentastar2/pentastar2 /pentastar2, falls into the second category. It sets out to rebut recent exuberant atheist tracts, such as Christopher Hitchens'sGod Is Not Great and Richard Dawkins's The God Atheists astronomer Robert Jastrow to the effect that the Big Bang leads usback to a moment when everything began\u2014and delivers us not to the doorstep of atheismbut theology. Dawkins's shrill dissent is telling. He dis- misses as \"infantile\" the arguments for God'sexistence offered by Aquinas and Anselm:\"The very idea that grand conclusions couldfollow from such logomatist trickery offendsme aesthetically.\" This is an odd claim, con-sidering it appears in the midst of a \"logoma-tist\" polemic. It also dodges the big question: If reason can explain everything, why can't it explain where things come from? Ethics produces an even greater quandary. Moral laws have changed less over the millen-nia than the recognized laws of physics andmathematics. The ethical principles thatundergird the Ten Commandments' prohibi-tions against stealing and murder are recog-nized by people in New York, New Guinea,Timbuktu, and even bin Laden's cave, while scientific theory has undergone numerous revolutions\u2014and will continue to do so. So what explains the uniformity of moral laws? As former atheist Antony Flew notes inThere Is a God , musings about the origin of life and virtue lead directly to God. So whenatheists invoke natural law standards, theyembrace the Creator they most wish to deny. On the broader issue of faith and reason, D'Souza states the obvious: \"Religious faith isnot in opposition to reason. The purpose offaith is to discover truths that are of the high-est importance to us through purely naturalmeans.\" He quotes philosopher LudwigWittgenstein: \"[E]ven if all possible scientificquestions are answered, the problems of life still have not been touched at all.\" Darwinists may be able to describe how older bees,wasps, ants, and termites help their youngersiblings, but they can't explain why RaoulWallenberg became a martyr for captive Jews. Atheism fails as a creed because it lacks humanity. It destroys the wall of sanctity thatdefends the weak from the strong. Itspawned history's most savage movements\u2014from the French Terror to the Stalinistpurges. None of the atheistic alternatives hassurvived because reason just doesn't make asatisfying god. This leads us to perhaps the strongest argument against atheism, which D'Souzamakes only indirectly\u2014the argument fromexperience. Atheism cannot reach our hearts.A rigorous atheist cannot console in a time ofgrief, cannot explain love, cannot sigh inhappy wonder at life's endless surprises. Hecan only utter, \"What is, is.\" Christianity, in contrast, offers the divine \"I Am\"\u2014God, speaking through Scripture,saying what he means and meaning what hesays. In the person of Jesus Christ, hetaught. He ministered. He saved. He chasedaway the moneychangers and wept at the news of Lazarus's death. He lived so boldly that he had to be killed\u2014yet didnot stay in the tomb. No other religion dares claim that God walked among us as fullyhuman. None describes the Lord as a ser-vant rather than overlord. None contem-plates an Almighty who humbly offers thebread and cup of love or gives his childrencomplete freedom to grasp his outstretchedhand or slap it away. Every child has felt a shiver of God as night closes and the world grows quiet. Adults,amid the bustle and din, know he's there.When trouble comes, we whisper his name.We cannot see, hear, or yet walk with him. Butfrom time to time we experience a presencethat defies description. The God of love is alsothe God of surprise. Atheists deny something profoundly obvious, something deeply unfor- gettable, that's woven into our souls. This explains D'Souza's asser- tion that \"God is back. losing. . . . God isthe future and atheism is on its way out.\"Atheists may be selling books, but they'renot making converts. Christianity is, espe-cially in places and congregations that takeScripture seriously\u2014and joyously. D'Souza calls atheists cowards. Not They're like the man who perishes in a firebecause he refuses to believe the net belowwill hold. What's So Great About Christianity performs a wonderful and overdue service. Itengages atheists exhaustively and carefully,exposing atheism more as a bundle of senti-ments than a coherent doctrine. Tony Snow , former press secretary for President George W.

Whether describ-ing an uptight supermom or a grief-stricken child molester, Perrotta rarely fails to see the humanity in his characters. So how doeshe do with conservative Christians in The Abstinence Teacher /pentastar2/pentastar2/pentastar2/pentastar2/pentastar2 ? In Perrotta's newest novel, America's cul- ture wars boil down to the troubles of twolonely suburbanites, Ruth Ramsey and TimMason. Ruth is a divorced sex-ed teacherwhose philosophy is, \"Pleasure is good,shame is bad, and knowledge is power.\"When she takes one lesson too far, telling her students that some people actually enjoy oral sex, a family from a local fundamentalistchurch, \"The Tabernacle,\" threatens to sue.The school board descends with a newabstinence-only curriculum, and Ruth isoutraged. She balks at having to teach \"afarce, an attack on sexuality itself, nothingmore than officially sanctioned ignorance.\" Ironically, Ruth's own life is fairly joyless. So when she meets Tim, the attractive coachof her daughter's soccer team, she's predis-posed to feel weak in the knees. But\u2014ohno!\u2014barely two pages go by before it turnsout that Tim is one of \"them,\" those loonylegalists who preach that abstinence is sexy. This is all straight from the headlines, but once Perrotta begins to write from Tim'sperspective, he has some surprises in store.Though Tim tries to be a faithful Christian,he's a former addict who hankers after hisold trinity of drugs, sex, and rock 'n' roll.Marriage to a church girl (Carrie, myfavorite character) hasn't dampened hiswanderlust, even though thecouple has followed adviceof their church-approved mar-riage manual, Hot ChristianSex (a send-up of the LaHayes & Co.). With his tenuous faithand occasional slip-ups, Timfrequently finds himself on the wrong side of Pastor Dennis. Which brings me to mymain criticism: It's obvious that Perrotta did some research for this book (he mentions a Promise Keepers rally in the acknowledg-ments), but how much? His Tabernaclestrikes me as literary jerry-building, an off-hand composite of theological strains and worship styles that will probably ring true toan average reader, but not to an insider. It's little wonder that Tim Mason doesn't getmuch out of his Christianity\u2014it's a fiction. Still, The Abstinence Teacher isn't all bad. The relationships are believable, especiallywhen Tim and Ruth retreat from theirstereotypes long enough to find eachother. And it's gratifying to watch Ruth'sdaughters rebel in an unexpected direction\u2014 defying their mother by heading off to church to find Jesus. The only vic- tim left is Carrie, a genuine and all- too-familiar Christian woman who deserves a faithful husband and a decent church. Sadly, she won't find either in this novel.

The new Tim Burton-esque hit, averag- ing 7 .5 million viewers each week, is a fan-tasy, crime show, and romantic comedyrolled into one. With colorful art directionand a tone recalling Amelie, Northern Expo- sure, and Big Fish, the dramedy is narrated and written as a bedtime story. PushingDaises allows viewers to escape into a 1950s world with neon-lighted pie restaurants,musical numbers, and one-of-a-kind char-acters like two elderly shut-ins (one with aneye patch) who found fame as a synchro-nized swimming duo, the Darling MermaidDarlings.

But with a second touch, Ned's gift isundone and the revived person dies again.But, if Ned doesn't reverse his deed in 60 seconds, someone else dies.

Blind with love, Ned refuses totouch her a second time, and after a nerve-racking minute, another man dies. This episode opened two story tracks: an exploration of morality and a love story. Nedand Chuck share genuine affection, if not abed (after all, if they touch, Chuck will dieagain). So they hold hands wearing thickgloves and kiss through Saran Wrap, and assuch, their love requires work, compromise,and commitment.

Also known as shape- note singing because of its musical notation, SacredHarp relies on powerful rhythm and strong harmoniesto belt out some of America's favorite hymns, such as\"Amazing Grace\" and the compositions of Isaac Watts.Since the Civil War, however, Sacred Harp, a term referring to the human voice, has been largely relegat- ed to the backwoods churches of the South. The docu-mentary film Awake My Soul: The Story of the Sacred Harp /pentastar2/pentastar2/pentastar2/pentastar2/pentastar2 gives viewers a history, from its 17th-century Puritan beginnings to its contemporary resurgence. European music masters and, after the Civil War, a modernizing, urbanizing South thought Sacred Harp backward and rustic. But its characteristic pounding has kept the music alive. This DVD displays the genre's overpowering volume. A grandfather of the modern revival says, \"It is tone quali-ty through volume that burns out the chaff.\" The lyrics are spirited and feisty. \"Serve with a singleheart and eye / and to thy glory live or die.\" \"The dead's alive and the lost is found / Glory Hallelu-jah.\" Sacred Harp is a communal experience, not a performance. Participants gather for daylongsingings, with plenty of food. They sit in a square and sing to God. And as this DVDshows, Sacred Harp is addicting. That's why I'm glad that a 30-track CDcomes with the film. \u2014Rob Moll For more visit ChristianityTodayMovies.com.by Mark 9:46 AM Page 82Haunting Salvation JOE HENRY'S CIVILIANS PORTRAYS A COUNTRY NEEDING GRACE.\u00bb HENRY : MELANIE NISSENTHE LIST LiteratureWatch Gregory Wolfe's favorite websites featuring spiritual literary writing.

Adenauer had the unenviable job of restoring government to a demoralized land in which every large city had been bombed to rubble. He founded the Christ-ian Democratic Union political party and, with the help of U.S. largesse in the Marshall Plan, led Germany into a new era. This party's very name shows a major difference in Euro- pean and American approaches to religion and politics. Whereas the U.S. insists on a strict separation of church andstate, the monarch of Britain holds the title \"Supreme Gover-nor of the Church of England,\" Polish priests openly cam-paign for like-minded politicians,and many European governmentssubsidize church activities, includ-ing the teaching of religion in pub-lic schools. On the day Nicolae Ceausescu was executed in Romania, ending 45 years of Communist rule, the state television station led with the pro-nouncement, \"Today the Antichrist died and Jesus Christ wasreborn in Romania!\" To European eyes, our controversiesover Christmas cr\u00e8ches and the Ten Commandments in pub-lic places seem strange indeed. Yet in the last 50 years, almost all European countries have seen a precipitous decline in church attendance andreligious belief. When Harris pollsters asked, \"Do you believein any form of God or supreme being?\" only 27 percent ofFrench and 35 percent of British respondents said yes; the others counted themselves atheist, agnostic, or unsure. Germany offers an interesting case study. Although only 41 percent of adults claim to believe in God, a majority of Germans still formally belong to a church, though fewattend. Church affiliation in Germany matters, if for no otherreason than it adds an extra 8 percent or so to your incometax bill. In other words, if you declare yourself an unbeliever,you save significant money. The government distributes the\"church tax,\" more than $10 billion annually, to approved denominations for their work in schools, hospitals, and gen- eral church upkeep. Now churches are seeing an alarming decline in their income stream. Every year some 300,000 Germans removetheir names from church rolls, with the number of Protes-tants declining by half since World War II. In one meeting Iattended, the bishop of Saxony\u2014the region where MartinLuther posted his 95 theses and Bach wrote his cantatas\u2014calmly reported that of 4.5 million citizens, only 850,000had affiliated with a church. He expected that number todecline to 350,000 by 2015 and perhaps dip as low as 30,000by 2030. After four decades under Communist rule, citizens of the East feel no civic pressure to keep traditional ties with a church. The bishop faces a discouraging task: cutting pas-tors' salaries, eliminating hospital chaplains, and shutteringchurches and schools. In the same meeting, a lively pastor showed a far more upbeat spirit. First he recounted personal stories of the diffi-culties that Christians faced under Communist rule. His chil- dren had limited educational opportunities, and he had to work as a plumber to supplement his meager pastor's salary. Every-thing changed \"after the wall camedown\" (a phrase I often heard). Although less than 20 percent of Saxony's citizens may belong to a church, he estimated that70 percent of those in Parliament are active, practicingChristians. Having lived under Communism, Christians quickly volunteered to step into a cultural vacuum of mean- ing and help the newly free society lay a foundation formoral and legal structure. They realized all too personallywhat can happen when Christians are excluded from thepublic square. In my writing, I sometimes caution Christians in the U.S. against confusing our mission with political causes; the closeassociation of evangelicals with particular political causes can easily derail our mission. The East Germans have a dif- ferent perspective, for understandable reasons. They believethat Christians have an important role to play in society. Asone of the German politicians expressed it, \"A liberal democ-ratic state requires conditions that it cannot create.\" In this election year, Americans are once again vigorous- ly debating the precarious balance between religion and politics. Europe offers a cautionary tale in both directions. In many places, the historic coziness between church and state has soiled the church's reputation. The church inSpain, for example, is still trying to recover from the damagedone by its close ties with the dictator Francisco Franco. Yet as the Saxon pastor pointed out, Christians removethemselves from the public square only at their peril. Find-ing the proper balance has profound implications for bothchurch and state. ctChurch in State In post-Communist Germany, Christian political involvement is surging.THE BACK PAGE PHILIP YANCEY A liberal democratic state requires conditions that it cannot create.
