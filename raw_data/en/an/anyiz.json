We are happy to feature Jou, an exclusive organic Chinese herb brand. Jou herbs are cultivated in Northern China by using the leaves, roots, stems, bark and petals of plants, shrubs and trees.

Chinese Herbs have been used as part of the traditional Chinese medicine system for thousands of years and have helped to alleviate many health issues. Ask for a complimentary consultation. Package pricing available. Be sure to inquire about our Health and Wellness Seminar Series.HOLISTIC HEA LTHCARE Do not underestimate the power of time-tested treatments to help the body heal itself. Traditional Chinese Medicine is more than 5,000 years old, but it is still a primary healthcare option in China. In the West, acupuncture is used as both preventative and integrative healthcare. According to the Chinese healthcare system, when the physical body is out of balance, we experience disharmony. The experienced acupuncturist works to help release blocked Chi (energy), restoring balance and health back to the body. ACUPUNCTURE Acupuncture is quickly becoming one of the fastest growing alternative therapies and is often recommended by family practitioners to complement and enhance the benefits of traditional medicine. Our onboard acupuncturist is certified to safely and effectively treat an extensive list of symptoms and conditions including, but not limited to, pain management (sciatica, joint, muscle and arthritic pain), seasickness, smoking cessation, weight gain, insomnia and anxiety. Of course you do not need to have any symptoms to benefit from acupuncture. Many enjoy a session for a simple tune up, enhanced relaxation, and wellbeing maintenance.
