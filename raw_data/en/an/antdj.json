P-gp is the 170-kDa protein product of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, which uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to pump substrates across the membrane. It consists of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). P-gp comprises 1280 amino acids divided into two symmetrical halves with 43% sequence homology between the two halves ( [Chen et al., 1986](#ref-8)). Each half contains six TMDs that are separated by a sequence of 75 amino acids that connect the C-terminal TMD with the N-terminal P-gp many physiological barriers, such as the blood-cerebrospinal fluid, blood-brain, and blood-testis barriers. P-gp plays a vital role in regulating the absorption and the efflux of various exogenous substances. P-gp is also present in multiple tissues and organs, including gut, kidney, liver, and placenta. Therefore, its activity is highly significant to the metabolism of numerous drugs ( [Hussaarts et al., 2019](#ref-22)), and the behavior of drug absorption will be influenced significantly through coadministration with P-gp inhibitor or inducer. Specifically, P-gp inhibitor may increase the bioavailability of drugs, whereas the inducer may reduce the drug absorption. Models of P-gp-Mediated Substrate Efflux. Drug resistance mediated by P-gp depends on ATP hydrolysis, and the Adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of P-gp is stimulated by the transported drugs ( [Mollazadeh et al., 2018](#ref-45)). P-gp inhibitors or substrates can enter the cell from the extracellular compartment to the cytosol via filtration, simple diffusion, or specialized transport. The first step of substrate efflux is the combination of P-gp and the substrates promoted by ATP-binding and hydrolys( [Wang et al., 2017a](#ref-64))is. Vanadate trapping and photo-cleavage experiments showed that P-gp contains two active ATPase sites, but only one ATP is hydrolyzed at a time ( [Hrycyna et al., 1998](#ref-20)). The hydrophobic \"vacuum cleaner\" model and the flippase model been describe P-gp-mediated drug translocation ( [Binkhathlan and Lavasanifar, 2013](#ref-4)). vacuum model, P-gp pulls its substrates from the lipid bilayer and pumps them out of the cell. The flippase model hypothesizes that P-gp \"scans\" the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer and binds specific lipids and hydrophobic drugs before their extrusion by \"flipping\" the phospholipids from the inner to outer leaflets of the lipid bilayer. The flippase model and the hydrophobic vacuum cleaner model are not mutually exclusive ( [O'Brien et al., 2012](#ref-48)), and the combination of the two models is illustrated ( [Fig. 2](#F3)). Multidrug Resistance and the Mechanisms Mediated by P-gp. MDR is common because of the overexpression of transporters on the tumor cell membranes. Several transporters belonging to the ABC pump family, such as P-gp and BCRP, are overexpressed in resistant tumor cells compared with normal cells ( [Robey et al., 2018](#ref-53)). This induced membrane state determines the efflux of chemotherapeutic agents through a process in which they are captured into the bilayer by the transporter and then effluxed out of the cells. Consequently, the efficacy of antitumor therapy is lowered because of the insufficient drug concentration inside the tumor cells. Role of P-gp in Cancer MDR. P-gp was first identified in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells that had been selected for resistance to drugs ( [Gottesman and Ling, 2006](#ref-16); [Sharom, 2011](#ref-56)). P-gp can intercept drugs before they reach their specific target in the cell by facilitating drug efflux and promoting MDR. Hence, it is always selected as the target for MDR reversal agents. The past three decades have witnessed the rapid development of strategies to reverse P-gp-mediated MDR. Many small molecular compounds were identified as P-gp inhibitors and can reverse P-gp-mediated MDR ( al., 2020](#ref-67)). The P-gp transport of anticancer agents can be inhibited with a competitive or noncompetitive mechanism of some small-molecule reversal agents. These reversal agents are coadministered with an anticancer drug to reduce its efflux, thus increasing its efficiency. Some compounds have shown promising experimental results in vitro. However, at present, there is no compound being approved for clinical use as a reversal agent ( [Kumar and Jaitak, 2019](#ref-28)). Studies of certain reversal agents were terminated as a result of unacceptable toxicities in clinical trials or insufficient efficacy ( [Varma et al., 2003](#ref-61)). Consequently, there remains a great challenge in searching for effective and less toxic agents to reverse tumor MDR. Development of P-gp Inhibitors in MDR Modulation To date, plenty of P-gp inhibitors have been found to modulate MDR activity in clinical trials. Based on their affinity with P-gp and different side effects, these inhibitors could be classified into first-, second-, and third-generation modulators. The [Varma et al., 2003](#ref-61)). The second-generation modulators are inhibitors with higher affinity and efficacy, lower toxicity, and absence of the intrinsic pharmacological activity that belonged to the analogs of the first generation. Most of them can be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme family and interact with chemotherapeutic drugs. When used together with anticancer drugs, their metabolism or interaction with the drugs leads to their unacceptable toxicity and, in turn, treatment failure ( [Kathawala et al., 2015](#ref-27)). The third generation is more specific and effective in reducing pharmacokinetic interactions compared with the second generation ( [Mistry et al., 2001](#ref-42)); some have been reported to increase the sensitivity of anticancer drugs in preclinical trials. However, most of these inhibitors still underperform in clinical trials because of diverse reasons, such as high toxicity. Examples of first-, second-, and third-generation P-gp inhibitors are shown in [Table 1](#T1). Although progress has been made in the field of MDR, a suitable P-gp inhibitor with significant MDR reversal and acceptable toxicity has yet to be identified. The main reasons are summarized as follows: firstly, P-gp is a complex protein owing to its plastic conformation ( [Ma et al., 2018](#ref-38)), and the existing inhibitors are nonspecific for P-gp. Besides, some inhibitors may interact with chemotherapeutic drugs when coadministered and may influence the integrity and functions of the brain. Furthermore, there lacks enough preclinical data and appropriate animal models to evaluate the efficiency of P-gp inhibitors. Traditional Chinese Medicine Modulation of P-gp At present, researchers have performed intensive efforts in the area of identifying MDR modulators from TCM. Various naturally originating compounds and plant extracts were reported for their modulation effect of MDR ( [Li et al., 2014](#ref-32); [Abdallah et al., 2015](#ref-1)). This review focuses on major of TCM, including flavonoids, alkaloids, coumarins, terpenoids, and quinonoids, and other this section, TCMs that have an MDR modulation effect are discussed. These compounds could inhibit or decrease the activity of P-gp ( [Table 2](#T2)). Flavonoids. Flavonoids are ubiquitous in many vegetables and herbs and are closely related to a number of human life benefits. Current research has demonstrated that flavonoids have various pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, [Karabin et al., 2015](#ref-26)). Flavonoids have also been reported to inhibit ABC transporters that contribute to the development of MDR. A few flavonoids, including 2018](#ref-9)), have been identified as substrates of P-gp. The cellular uptake of 40 flavonoids was measured in parental human mouth epidermal carcinoma (KB) cells and KB/MDR cells with or without elacridar. Molecular docking was also performed to investigate the structure-affinity relationship between P-gp and the flavonoids. The results indicated that 3-OH, 5-OH, 3-OCH3, and 4-OCH3 [Fang et the expression level of P-gp and BCRP but could not affect the expression of MDR-associated protein 1 in Adriamycin (ADR)-resistant human 7-O-geranylquercetin (GQ), a derivative of quercetin, could reverse drug resistance of ADR-resistant human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7/ADR) cells. GQ inhibited the efflux of ADR by downregulating the expression of P-gp protein and its encoding MDR1 gene in MCF-7/ADR [Zhang et anhydrosilychristin et al., 2019](#ref-62)). [Chen et al. (2018)](#ref-9) evaluated the effects of some natural flavonoids on P-gp activity, including taxifolin, luteolin, ()-gallocatechin, found that taxifolin could significantly resensitize MDR cancer cells in combination with chemotherapeutic agents and enhance the efficacy. This result suggested that taxifolin could be considered as a potential P-gp modulator for the synergistic treatment of MDR cancers. [Saeed et al. (2015)](#ref-54) found that apigenin could not only inhibit the activity of P-gp but also inhibit the activity of BCRP by increasing cellular uptake of ADR and synergistic inhibition of cell viability in combination with ADR in MDR cells. The molecular docking experiment indicated that apigenin could bind to the NDBs of P-gp, which suggested that apigenin may compete with ATP on NDBs and lead to energy depletion to fuel the transport of P-gp substrates. Curcumin has been described to inhibit both the function of P-gp and the expression of P-gp ( [Lopes-Rodrigues et al., 2016](#ref-36)). Glabridin can increase the accumulation of ADR in drug-induced resistant human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231/MDR1) cells by suppressing the expression of P-gp and competitively inhibiting the P-gp efflux pump and enhance the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231/MDR1 cells induced by ADR, thus realizing reversal effects on MDR. Therefore, the combination therapy of anticancer drugs and glabridin is a promising strategy to overcome P-gp-mediated MDR ( [Qian et al., 2019](#ref-52)). Some flavonoids have been reported to possess significant P-gp inhibitory activity via diverse mechanisms. [Mohana et by performing molecular docking. Curcumin could enhance anticancer efficacy through the ablation of nuclear factor-B, the wingless/integrated beta-catenin pathway, as well as mammalian target of rapamycin signaling ( [Mohana et could reverse MDR in MCF-7/ADR and K562/ADR cell lines. It enhanced the cytotoxicity of ADR by downregulating MDR1 mRNA a mitogen-activated protein signal-regulated kinase pathway and inhibiting the ( [Sun et al., 2018](#ref-59)). Alkaloids. Alkaloids are a group of naturally originating chemicals containing one or more basic nitrogen atoms and are classified into different groups based on the amino acid they are derived from. Many reports have revealed the ability of alkaloids to inhibit P-gp. The structural analysis of alkaloids suggested that the P-gp inhibitory function is due to the presence of 1) a basic nitrogen atom and 2) two planar aromatic rings. Alkaloids have been reported to inhibit the function of P-gp via diverse mechanisms. Among various alkaloids investigated in in vitro experiments as P-gp inhibitors or MDR reversal agents, a natural alkaloid called CBT-01 (tetrandrine) has already been tested on clinical trials. Tetrandrine can antagonize MDR in both drug-induced and MDR1 gene-transfected cancer cells by downregulating the expression of P-gp, followed by increasing the intracellular concentration of chemotherapeutic agents. The combination therapy using tetrandrine and other anticancer drugs could promote the treatment efficiency of drugs that are substrates of P-gp ( [Liao isolated from Stephania tetrandra, could significantly reduce the expression level of P-gp expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Tetrandrine and fangchinoline showed a significant synergistic, cytotoxic effect in MDR human colon cancer cells (Caco-2) and CEM/ADR cancer cells in combination with ADR (Sun and Wink, 2014). Besides, there exists a large number of natural alkaloids possessing potent inhibition of the P-gp responsible for the development of resistance ( [Joshi et al., 2017](#ref-25)). Chelidonine, isolated from Chelidonium majus, could also inhibit the function of P-gp and consequently upregulate the xenobiotic metabolism an inhibition on P-gp. [Zhou et al. (2018)](#ref-71) reported that matrine could inhibit MCF-7/ADR cell growth, induce cell apoptosis, and reverse MDR for breast cancer cells through the mediation of downstream apoptosis factors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway by decreasing the cell phosphorylation level of AKT. Terpenoids. Terpenoids are one of the most extensively studied and structurally diverse classes of TCM. Based on the number of isoprene units in the parent structure, terpenoids transporters. rosemary-originated terpenoid ursolic acid ( [Zong et al., 2019](#ref-74)) was found to inhibit P-gp and increase the cellular accumulation of ADR and rhodamine 123 (Rh123). The chemosensitization effect of ursolic acid was tested; the result indicated that these compounds could significantly reduce the growth of cells in the presence of ADR. Terpenoids have been reported to possess significant P-gp inhibitory activity via several mechanisms. Parthenolide inhibited P-gp upregulation and promoted the intracellular accumulation of ADR in ADR-resistant human non-small-cell lung cancer (A549/ADR) cells. Parthenolide inhibited the development of the resistance toward ADR, which exhibited an inhibitory effect on the overexpression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 and cells P-gp [Cai al. found that cryptotanshinone and dihydrotanshinone could increase the intracellular accumulation of anticancer drugs by downregulating P-gp mRNA and levels and isotenulin significantly inhibited P-gp P-gp activity. The combinations and isotenulin drugs significantly belonging to the benzopyrone family of TCM, are mostly found in plants rich in oils. They can be classified as simple coumarins, furanocoumarins, pyranocoumarins, and pyrone-substituted coumarins based on the the substituents. The P-gp inhibitory activity of galbanic acid Rh123 efflux assay in multidrug-resistant leukemia HL60 cells. It was found to be more potent than verapamil in terms of P-gp expression inhibition ( [Choi et al., 2016](#ref-10)). Coumarins have been reported to inhibit P-gp through multiple mechanisms. Osthole decreased the expression of P-gp at both mRNA and protein levels. Further experiments demonstrated that osthole could suppress P-gp expression by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is possibly the main mechanism accounting for the reversal potential of osthole in K562/ADR cells ( [Wang et al., 2016](#ref-63)). Quinonoids. Quinone compounds are a class of chemical components with the quinoid structure in TCM and are mainly divided into four miltiorrhiza, demonstrates anticancer activities in P-gp-overexpressing human cancer cells. Current studies have suggested that miltirone can inhibit the activity of P-gp and apoptotic induction in a human hepatoma (HepG2) and P-gp-overexpressing HepG2/ADR cell line ( [Zhou et 1,3,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) toward P-gp were estimated using docking analysis. The results indicated that all the investigated anthraquinones were potential inhibitors of P-gp under physiological conditions, indicating their roles as potential protectors against patient resistance toward various anticancer drugs ( [Jeremi et al., 2018](#ref-24)). Emodin reversed ADR resistance in K562/ADR cells by decreasing the expression of P-gp. It can increase the accumulation of Rh123 in both K562/ADR and Caco-2 cells and, cytotoxicity and apoptosis in PTX-resistant ovarian cancer cells, reflecting the reverse of MDR. Further studies indicated that the MDR reversal effect of shikonin was independent of inhibiting the activity of P-gp ( [Wang et al., 2019](#ref-65)). Moreover, and acetoxyisovalerylshikonin) showed inhibition of P-gp and increased uptake and reduced efflux of anticancer drugs in the malignant cancer cells, suggesting that chemotherapy in combination with shikonin compounds may be beneficial to cancer cells ( [Wang et al., 2019](#ref-65)). Traditional Chinese Medicine Extracts. Bufo gargarizans (Asiatic toad), a popular Chinese herb, showed a reversal effect on P-gp-mediated MDR in colorectal cancer cells. More studies showed that the representative ingredient, cinobufagin, significantly enhanced the sensitivity of P-gp-overexpressing cells to ADR without affecting the corresponding parental cells. Studies further revealed that the mechanism of action involved noncompetitive inhibition of P-gp ( [Yuan et al., 2017](#ref-69)). Salvia herb anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. The diterpenoid tanshinone, which coexisted in the S. miltiorrhiza extract, could significantly enhance the absorption of cryptotanshinone. Danxiongfang is a useful preparation composed of the S. miltiorrhiza extract, which mainly includes lipophilic diterpenoid tanshinones, water-soluble salvianolic acids, and ferulic acid. It could be used to treat coronary heart diseases and cerebrovascular disease. Danxiongfang could influence the absorption of cryptotanshinone. It has been proposed that the oral bioutilization of cryptotanshinone can be enhanced by reducing the efflux and transport of P-gp in combination with chinensis), known as wu wei zi in Chinese, could inhibit the efflux of P-gp. Its active components include schizandrol A, -schisandrin, schizandrin B, and schizandrin C. Some experiments showed that schizandrin B increased the intracellular accumulation of ADR through inhibiting expression and activity of P-gp (Wang et al., 2017). The MDR reverse effect of schizandrol A Coptis chinensis, is a well known Chinese herb. CR contains abundant isoquinoline alkaloids, such as berberine, coptisine, and palmatine. Cell shown that CR decoction, berberine, coptisine, palmatine can [Yu et al., 2018](#ref-68)). The wutou-gancao herb pair is extensively used to attenuate the toxicity and enhance the efficacy of aconite. The active components of liquorice (gancao) could inhibit the efflux of P-gp through Caco-2 cells. Since aconitine from Aconitum (wutou) has been shown to be a P-gp substrate; the synergic effect is attributed to the inhibition of P-gp by liquorice. The results showed the potential synergic mechanism of the wutou-gancao herb pair, which could help to elucidate the compatibility principle of the two herbs by inhibiting P-gp function and enhancing the systemic circulation exposure of aconitine and further anti-inflammatory effects ( [He et al., 2020](#ref-18)). Approaches for Studying the Interaction of P-gp and TCM In Vitro Approaches for TCM Interactions with P-gp. Several in vitro screening assays can be used to characterize the interplay between test compounds and P-gp to identify drugs as P-gp substrates or inhibitors ( [Polli et al., 2001](#ref-50)). The basic principle of the classification method is determining the effect on P-gp function and expression. Functional assays used to screen P-gp inhibitors include the detection of the changes in P-gp content and the expression level of the MDR1 gene, the evaluation of the P-gp was used to determine the effect of reversal agent on P-gp via the calculation of IC50 and the degree of drug resistance. Concentration changes in P-gp content and the levels of MDR1 genes were typically measured in cells by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and/or flow cytometry ( digitonin and the cytotoxicity of their combinations. Rhodamine 123 and Calcein-Acetoxymethylester were further used to detect the effects of polyphenols on the activity of P-gp. It has been validated that the combination of nontoxic concentrations of each polyphenol with ADR could synergistically improve the drug efficacy toward Caco-2 and CEM/ADR cells. Polyphenols could modulate the activity of P-gp and may be used as chemosensitizers. Bidirectional transcellular transport assay is the gold standard for identifying P-gp substrates in vitro and represents the most accurate predictive model for the identification of P-gp inhibitors in vivo ( [Feng et al., 2008](#ref-14)). Drug-resistant cell lines with overexpression of P-gp are widely used to investigate the effect of test compounds as potential inhibitors of P-gp in this method. There are many cell lines suitable for use in bidirectional transcellular transport assays, including the naturally P-gp-expressing Caco-2 cells and polarized MDR1-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, with distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains. The apparent permeability coefficient (apical to basolateral/basolateral to apical) was used to judge whether the intestinal absorption of a drug would be affected by P-gp. It was considered that the transport of a drug was directional when the apparent permeability coefficient (apical to basolateral/basolateral to apical) was more ( [Liang et al., 2012](#ref-34)). When the efflux rate of a probe substrate decreased, it was considered that the agent may inhibit the activity of P-gp; the schematic diagram of the method is shown in [Fig. 3A](#F4). The effect of different tanshinones on the P-gp efflux function was first investigated by using a digoxin bidirectional transport assay. According to the results, among the five tanshinones tested, only cryptotanshinone and dihydrotanshinone could decrease the efflux ratio of digoxin bidirectional transport across a Caco-2 indicating on P-gp function ( [Hu et al., 2014](#ref-21)). Meanwhile, these in vitro methods have their limitations and should be fully considered in practice. Different studies have used the same assay for the same compound but reported contrasting results. In addition to the discordance in the results obtained from different in vitro studies, there have also been some disagreements between in vitro and in vivo findings regarding the P-gp substrates or inhibitors ( [Lund et al., 2017](#ref-37)). In Vivo Approaches for TCM Interactions with P-gp. The generation of MDR1-knockout mice has boosted the study of the pharmacological influence on the function of P-gp ( [Li et al., 2020](#ref-31)). By comparing brain/plasma ratios between these P-gp-deficient mice to those of the wild-type controls, it has been possible to screen drugs as potential P-gp substrates in vivo ( [Mittapalli et al., 2012](#ref-43)). Alternatively, P-gp inhibitors can be evaluated by investigating the influence of P-gp inhibition on drug pharmacokinetics in wild-type animals. Coadministration of digoxin with verapamil or emodin can increase the area under the curve of digoxin by 55% and 51%, respectively. Emodin demonstrated vivo ( [Li et al., 2014](#ref-32)). In vivo studies were also conducted on tumor-bearing mice. The chemosensitization effects of TCM have been investigated through changes in tumor growth or survival rate of tumor-bearing mice ( [Fig. 3B](#F4)) a TCM has MDR-reversing activity, tumor growth should be inhibited, and the survival period of tumor-bearing rats should be prolonged. An in vivo antitumor study showed that coencapsulated PTX and baicalein in nanoemulsions demonstrated higher antitumor efficacy than other PTX formulations. The antitumor effect of various PTX formulations in vivo was evaluated in models using mice bearing MCF-7/Tax xenograft tumors ( [Meng et al., 2016](#ref-40)). vitamin D3 and curcumin could potentially synergize their ability to decrease drug resistance by decreasing P-gp. In vivo, the triple therapy group (PTX + curcumin + D3) resulted in the smallest tumor size, indicating that the addition of curcumin and D3 could enhance the therapeutic effect on the tumor ( [Attia et al., 2020](#ref-3)). In Silico Prediction Method. With the rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence, in silico methods have acquired an increasing interest in P-gp inhibitor discovery. Compared with the classic methods, these in silico methods have an enormous potential to speed up the preclinical development processes at minimal costs. Using in silico virtual screening to detect novel P-gp inhibitors is an important application of molecular simulations. At present, no human crystallized P-gp has been published. Since the sequence identity between the human protein and the murine protein is 87%, the available structures of the murine protein are important for molecular docking from different perspectives ( [Pajeva et al., 2009](#ref-49); [Jabeen et al., 2011](#ref-23)). [Shityakov Forster (2014)](#ref-57) ran molecular docking in the crystallized murine structure with polynomial empirical scores using a P-gp inhibitor library of 1300 molecules. To understand the interaction of ADR and miltirone with P-gp, molecular docking analysis was conducted. The results indicated the most energetically optimal binding modes of ADR and miltirone at the drug-binding cavities of mouse P-gp (Protein Data shown in [Fig. 3C](#F4) al., 2015](#ref-72)). However, the human P-gp homology model showed more limitations to predict the experimental data. In addition, no human crystallized P-gp has been made available, and extrapolation of the results from animals to humans is not always satisfactory ( [Montanari and Ecker, 2015](#ref-46)). Conclusions and Outlook Despite the promising preclinical results of P-gp inhibitors, no compound has yet been approved for clinical use as an MDR reversal agent. Studies were terminated because of unexpected toxicities in clinical trials or insufficient efficacy in vivo. Consequently, identifying MDR reversal agents with high efficacy and limited toxicity remains a big challenge. Because of the characteristic of low toxicity, an increasing number of TCMs, including flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, coumarins, quinonoids, and other TCM extracts, have been investigated for their potential as MDR reversal agents and have shown good efficacy for reversing MDR in experimental model systems. TCM has been reported to reverse P-gp-mediated MDR with diverse mechanisms, such as inhibiting P-gp-mediated drug efflux ( [Abdallah et al., 2015](#ref-1)), hindering the of P-gp ATPase, and reducing P-gp levels by downregulating the expression of the MDR1 gene. Currently, studies on identifying TCM as P-gp reversal agents have mainly been conducted in vitro using cell models, rat models, and in silico methods. However, the in vitro approaches for screening are labor-intensive and time-consuming at present. The molecular docking results from the human P-gp homology model is not always satisfactory. Technologies such as proteoliposome, which can predict the interaction of the active compound with the target protein, should be explored to establish a new high-throughput screening method. On the other hand, the influence of P-gp inhibition on tissue pharmacokinetics and intratumoral distribution of anticancer drugs is very important when coadministered with a P-gp inhibitor. More efforts should be made to explore the effects of TCM on the pharmacokinetic processes of anticancer drugs in vivo to choose the optimal therapeutic protocol for cancer treatment. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is commonly used to determine the drug concentration in homogenized tissues, whereas it is not accurate for tumors because of heterogeneous characteristics. Since the heterogeneous tissue and the tumor microenvironment markedly affect drug penetration, it is necessary to detect not only the level of exposure but also the spatial distribution of the drug within the tumor tissue. Thus, the use of only LC-MS/MS analysis is insufficient for clarifying the behavior of antitumor drugs. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), which could offer spatial information for the drug in the tumor tissue, has recently been used as an innovative tool for detecting the molecular distribution of pharmacological agents in heterogeneous targets. Compared with LC-MS/MS, MSI does not require homogenization of tumor tissue, so it can provide information on the spatial distribution of the detected drugs in the tissue. This technique would certainly improve our understanding of the heterogeneous and irregular tumor drug distribution. In summary, TCMs will play a crucial role in the development of effective MDR modulators in the future. The in vitro techniques, such as bidirectional transcellular transport assays and in silico prediction method, will greatly influence drug development. These approaches can help predict the effect of TCM on P-gp and provide an impetus to the discovery of more MDR reversal agent candidates for clinical trials. However, precise techniques, such as MSI, discussed in this review were needed for in vivo validation. In brief, the current challenge is how to identify suitable P-gp inhibitors with significant MDR reversal and acceptable toxicity from TCM and thus improve the treatment effect of chemotherapy drugs in clinical cancer therapy.
