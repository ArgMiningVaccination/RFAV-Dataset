Making sure your pooch gets their vaccinations on time provides him or her with the ongoing protection they need against serious diseases. Both Lyme disease and Leptospirosis are particularly prevalent in Maryland. Not all veterinarians agree, however, on when and what vaccinations should be administered. Here is a look at both the standard and holistic views on the matter. The Holistic Approach is to Delay and Reduce Vaccinations Holistic veterinarians are not as keen on setting a dog-shot schedule for young puppies. In general, they prefer going easy on vaccinations in an effort to prevent vaccine-induced illnesses and to encourage homeopathic or natural remedies. As well, to further minimize risks, some vets only administer shots for certain serious diseases to which the dog could be exposed, based on location and lifestyle. Under the holistic approach, puppies aren't vaccinated until they turn 22 weeks old. They start with a shot for distemper and then, on week 26, receive a parvovirus vaccine. Rabies shots are scheduled for week 30. Some veterinarians also provide second distemper and parvovirus shots on weeks 24 and 28, respectively. Under this approach, the owner accepts that the puppy has minimal protection against Parvovirus and Distemper Virus. If the puppy becomes infected with either of these viruses, there is a >50% mortality rate, even with treatment. Combination vaccines are usually avoided as holistic veterinarians believe them to be less effective in providing immunity than single shots. Annual boosters are also not recommended, unless the dog's health and environmental factors call for them. Conventional Dog-Shot Schedules Begin at an Early Age Veterinarians with the standard approach to vaccinations recommend starting early. They believe young puppies are especially vulnerable to serious diseases and, thus, need to build their defenses quickly. The conventional approach is to have puppies vaccinated against parvovirus, canine distemper and infectious hepatitis when they reach six weeks of age. The second shot is administered at 10 to 12 weeks and the third at 14 to 16 weeks. From then on, they are to receive annual revaccinations. The age for, and frequency of, rabies shots depends on local laws. The use of combination vaccinations when the puppy reaches its sixth and ninth weeks: the combination shot protects against distemper, hepatitis, parainfluenza and parvovirus (DHP-P). Another combination shot is administered during weeks 12 and 15. Coronavirus, Lyme, Leptospirosis and Bordetella vaccines are included in the puppy vaccine program if the puppy is at high risk for these diseases. These are administered as separate vaccines. A rabies vaccination is given at 16 weeks of age. Booster shots are administered 1 year later. The DHPP and RABIES boosters are given every 3 years. Whatever the Schedule is, It is Important to Stay on Track Once you've decided on the best vaccination approach for your dog, you need to make sure you keep to the schedule and note the dates on your calendar. Set reminders on your phone or computer, and create a spreadsheet that will allow you to track what shots your puppy has already been given, what is still required and when. Many veterinarians contact dog owners when their pooch is due for an annual booster. If your vet does this, see to it that a personalized vaccination protocol is in place which factors in your dog's medical history, age, lifestyle, travel habits and environment. Monitoring your dog-shot schedule is a must if you want to ensure that your canine pal does not miss out on a necessary vaccination. Picking a standard or holistic vaccination approach and staying on top of it will help your dog lead a longer, healthier and, ultimately, happier life.
