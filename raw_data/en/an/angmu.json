The idea of a European CDC hasbeen in the air for many years, following the successful andinteresting results obtained by the United States CDC in Atlanta. The creation of the Stockholm Centre is timely for many important public health reasons. For the World Health Organization, it is goodnews and an asset for the European region. The European CDC istimely; health threats, mainly of a communicable nature, aremultiplying all over the word, and will continue to do so in thefuture. These threats are alarming people, shaking health systemsand increasing stress in populations. Their consequences areworsened by their suddenness and the difficulty in predicting whenthey will appear. Surveillance and control ofcommunicable diseases is nowadays a major duty forpublic health. The emergence of new communicablediseases and the re-emergence of old ones such astuberculosis was not predicted. On the contrary,twenty or thirty years ago, public health expertsoften claimed that the age of communicable diseaseswas over: the wrong prognosis, as it turns out. AIDSappeared in the early 1980s and more recentlySARS and avian flu have been at the forefront of global health. Notonly are communicable diseases not over, they will remain a majorconcern for decision makers, health systems and health professionals,and societies at large. But in comparison to the past, when wewere helpless against these diseases, the context has changed. Wenow have new instruments that we can use to face communicablediseases, not only for treatment, but for surveillance and monitoring.Many countries and institutions in Europe are involved and areequipped to do this. The creation of the new ECDC will contribute to increasing the cooperation, harmonisation and efficiency of all of them, and alsodevelop knowledge that will be shared with other countries andorganisations. This will no doubt result in better health monitoringin the field of communicable diseases in this important region ofthe world.For its part, WHO, globally and through the regional office, will cooperate with the ECDC in the same spirit as its partnerships withthe European Commission. Our cooperation will, of course, betechnical and scientific. We already have a staff member secondedto the Commission, working in the field of surveillance. We areready to develop innovative ways of cooperation with the new centre,which happens to be located very close to our regional office inCopenhagen. This will be facilitated by the fact that we share thesame values and visions concerning public health, and in particularwith regard to equity and human rights for health development. The recent nomination of Mrs Zsuzsanna Jakab as Director of the ECDC will no doubt enhance this collaboration. Mrs Jakab hasworked at WHO as director of several of its divisions. Once she takes up her duties, discussions will begin on the bestway to organise our common work. Our contribution will include creating links and bridges with countries that are not yet members of theEuropean Union, but which belong to the Europeanregion of WHO. These countries, especially those ofthe former Soviet Union, are the new neighbours of theEuropean Union. Communicable diseases have no boundaries; this would be a cynical but realistic reason for cooperatingwith them, but human rights, solidarity and equity are also a veryimportant basis for this cooperation. The European regional office of WHO is close to all these countries, with its daily cooperation, its deep knowledge, and, moreconcretely, its offices located in each of them. This will facilitatethe links and cooperation between the ECDC and this part of theEuropean region of WHO. We are ready to help, as we considerthat all energy and resources, scarce in the health field, need to bewell used to the benefit of the health of populations. Any otherattitude would be contrary to our ethical values. We wish the ECDCa long life and good work and results. We are committed to stronglysupporting its development and mission for better health. \"WHO, globally and through the regional office, will cooperate with the ECDC in the same spirit as its partnerships with the European Commission\"A MUL TILEVEL APPROACH TO UNDERST ANDING THE RESURGENC EA DE V O L UTION OF INFECTIOUS SYP HILIS IN WESTERN EUROPE Kevin A Fenton, Health Protection Agency Centre for Infections, London, United Kingdom EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 3Nearly eight years after an outbreak of infectious syphilis was first reported in Bristol, England [1], successive outbreaks have occurred in most western European countries [2]. In this issue of Eurosurveillance we take a look at the recent resurgence and evolution of infectioussyphilis in seven European countries [3-9] in order to critically reviewour understanding of its epidemiology, and to examine opportunitiesfor directing interventions in the near future. The papers also providesome insight into the multilevel, multifactorial causation of syphilisepidemics [10], and how this may be changing over time in thepresence of preventive interventions. Heterogeneity and epidemic phasesNear simultaneous rises in the numbers and rates of diagnoses of infectious syphilis began in a few western European countriestowards the end of the last decade [2]. Within a 2-3 year period,broadly increasing trends were reported across the continent,initially manifested as outbreaks in previously low incidence urbanareas. Although initially located predominantly within men whohave sex with men (MSM) populations, subsequent outbreaks havebeen recorded among various subgroups including commercial sexworkers and their clients, and migrant communities, and amongheterosexual adults in sexual networks with highpartner change rates [2]. This subsequenthetereogeneity reflected the reality that the resurgenceof syphilis in many western European countries isactually comprised of many distinct subpopulationepidemics, with varying impacts according to sexuality;ethnicity; gender; age group; area of residence; andinteraction with public health services. The observed differences in the trajectory of epidemics between European countries are in partdependent upon when and where the infection wasintroduced; the natural history and transmissibility of syphilis; thestructure of the sexual networks; the demographic, economic, socialand epidemiological context; and the response of the STI treatmentand care services [10]. For example, the very large and protracted risesin infectious syphilis reported from the United Kingdom [8] andGermany [5] are in fact comprised of multiple outbreaks occurring inmajor urban and suburban centres with large populations of high-risk groups; dense and complex sexual networks; and travel andmigration between outbreak sites. In contrast, the outbreak in Ireland,reported in this issue by Cronin et al [6], was largely limited to MSMin Dublin. Its subsequent declining incidence, unique among thecollated reports, may well reflect the relatively small size of the MSMpopulation; relatively lower prevalence of risk sexual behaviours; feweropportunities for high rates of partner change; and the impact ofeffective and early public health intervention [6]. Context and interaction among epidemicsThat the outbreaks seemed to occur almost simultaneously across geographic sites in Europe remains largely unexplained. In some settings, expansions in the susceptible pool of highly sexuallyactive MSM may have occurred, whether through improved survivalof HIV infected individuals due to HAART [7], or natural increases inthe proportion of homosexually active male population [12]. Just asthe selective death of MSM with high rates of high-risk sexual activitymay have contributed to decreased rates of HIV and syphilis spreadthroughout the 1990s, the converse - increased survival - may havecontributed to the disproportionate and rapid increases in gonorrhoeaand syphilis rates seen subsequently among MSM. The widespreaduptake and use of HAART began almost uniformly throughout westernEurope and North America in 1996. This may have had the effect of'standardising' across countries the point from which the populationimpact of HAART began to take effect (including reduction in AIDSdeaths, increased survival, improved health, return to sexual activity,treatment optimism). The worsening high-risk sexual behaviour reportedfrom MSM behavioural surveillance programmes [13, 14] are in partattributed to the increasing prevalent pool of HIV positive MSM whouniformly report relatively higher prevalence of risk behaviours, casualsex partners, use of commercial sex venues and the internet for sexpartner acquisition, compared with HIV negative men [13]. Finally,increasing overseas travel between European cities with large MSMpopulations may have facilitated bridging between epicentres, facilitatingmore rapid and efficient transmission. Connections between MSM fromother European cities have been a defining feature of many western European MSM outbreaks [2,6,8]. The collated papers also give some insight into the social contexts surrounding heterosexual transmissionof syphilis in western Europe. Throughout the 1990s,major political, economic and social upheaval incountries of the former Soviet Union resulted indemographic and behavioural changes characterisedby population movement; increasing sex work; rapid spread of HIV and other STIs [15].Similar determinants were observed in the CzechRepublic, where increases in syphilis, including congenital syphilis, have been observed since the political changes of1989 [7]. The speed and magnitude of the Soviet epidemics had a directimpact on neighbouring European countries [2], largely due to populationmovement (for migration, recreational or business travel) into andoutside of high-incidence areas. The growing prevalence and distribution of HIV in many western European countries may also be influencing the acquisition andtransmission of syphilis. Epidemiological synergy - the biologicalinteraction between STIs - may be of importance for understandingthe recent evolution of syphilis among MSM populations in westernEurope [16]. More recent evidence from the United States suggeststhat increases in syphilis may not necessarily be associated withconcomitant increases in HIV transmission due to seroconcordantsexual mixing among HIV infected individuals [17]. Similarincreased burden of other bacterial STIs among HIV positive MSM[18] suggests the plausibility of this explanation in Europe, andconfirms the need for focused interventions with HIV positive MSM. The influence of social structures Relatively little work has been done on the influence of social structures on the distribution of syphilis in European populations todate. There is some evidence that the behaviours that expose individuals The factors that influence syphilis transmission operate at different levels: individual, sexual partnerships and sexual networks; each of them influenced by social, behavioural, and biomedical factorsto syphilis and other STIs may well be clustered at the lower end of the social hierarchy [10]. This is particularly so among heterosexuallyacquired syphilis in Europe, given the very strong association betweendisease incidence and certain migrant and ethnic minority communities- often among the most disenfranchised social groups in manyEuropean societies. Social inequity, ethnically assortative sexualmixing, concurrency, travel to countries of origin, commercial sexworker contact, and poor access to curative health services form partof the spectrum of their experiences and provide mechanisms throughwhich syphilis transmission may be facilitated or accelerated. Among MSM, there is even less evidence regarding the relationship between education, occupation and social stratificationand STI risk and morbidity amongst homosexually active men. In England, the annual Gay Men's Sex Survey [19] uses educationalqualifications as an indicator of socioeconomic status. GMSS dataindicate that men with less formal education (usually leaving schoolat the age of 16) have a higher prevalence of diagnosed HIVinfection than men educated to A-level (usually at the age of 18)or above. GMSS data also indicate that men with less formaleducational qualifications have more unprotected anal intercourse(UAI) with regular partners than better educated men and, despitebeing less likely to have casual sex, less well educated men are morelikely to have casual UAI. Less well educated men are also morelikely than men with higher educational qualifications to be involvedin HIV serodiscordant unprotected anal intercourse (sdUAI) [19].The association with syphilis transmission is less clear and remainsan area for further investigation. Multilevel interventionsThe factors that influence syphilis transmission therefore operate at different levels ranging from the individual (biological andbehavioural factors); their sexual partnerships; and the sexualnetworks in which they are found. However, sexual networks arein turn embedded in subpopulations which constitute a population.Each of these levels are in turn influenced by social, behavioural,and biomedical factors, including the response of public healthservices and interventions [10]. Consequently, syphilis preventionand control interventions need to be multilevel, but should also takeinto account the interaction between these strata. In this issue of Eurosurveillance , the collated papers on syphilis outbreaks provide insight into the multilevel causation of theresurgence of this disease in western Europe and illustrate someof the multilevel responses to these outbreaks. Success, if measuredby a reduction in disease incidence to pre-outbreak levels, remainselusive in many outbreak sites. Nevertheless, valuable lessons arebeing learnt about implementing innovative and appropriateinterventions in outbreak situations and how these may be evaluated. In Ireland, one of the few countries to have observed a recent reduction in syphilis cases [6], key elements of the multilevelprevention response included: the establishment of an outbreakcontrol management team; improving epidemiological surveillance;awareness raising with professionals and affected communities;additional investment into treatment and care services; escalatingpartner notification activity; health education; and more recently,community outreach testing and screening [6]. There is an urgentneed to better understand why the epidemic trajectory in Irelanddiffers from other European countries that continue to see increasingor stable disease incidence. Finally, the assembled papers strongly demonstrate the importance of improving surveillance as a key step in enhancing prevention andcontrol interventions. Faced with an escalation of disease incidence,the country level responses have included strengthening mandatorylaboratory reporting systems; introducing new sentinel programmes(laboratory or clinical); improving the range of epidemiological datacollected; adopting novel approaches to collect patient information;and triangulating data sources in order to improve the validationof the data collected. At the European level, the establishment ofa European early warning and response system for STI outbreaks(ESSTI ALERT) [20] has ensured that information on these incidentsis more rapidly identified and disseminated across the EU. The recentEU-wide notification and response to outbreaks of lymphogranulomavenereum in MSM [21] attests to the utility of such Europe-widecollaboration. Although various combinations of these multilevel interventions have been employed across the syphilis outbreak sites, further workis now needed to understand which interventions are most effective,and in which circumstances, and when they are best applied.

Methicillin resistance rates of S. aureus vary considerably between countries, with a high prevalence in the United States, and southern Europe(> 20%) and a low prevalence in northern Europe ( 5%). Community-acquired MRSA emerged worldwide in the late 1990s.There has been great confusion in the literature between healthcare-associated MRSA infections occurring in the community in patients who are at risk of acquiring hospital MRSA (such as thosewith past history of hospital admission, immunocompromised status, etc.), and true CA-MRSA infections due to strains that arepresent in the community only. Demographic characteristics of hospital-acquired (HA-)MRSA infections differ from those of CA-MRSA,the former occurring mainly in elderly people and thelatter occurring in young people. HA-MRSA infectionsare particularly associated with surgical wounds orintravenous indwelling catheters. CA-MRSA infectionsare mainly primary skin and soft tissue infections occurring in patients with no initial skin wounds.The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) produced byCA-MRSA strains all over the world represents, withits necrotic activity, one of the virulence factors possibly associatedwith cutaneous tissue destruction. The necrotic activity of PVLseems to be the major factor behind dramatic cases of necrotisingpneumonia, leading to a massive alveolar septa destruction; the is 75%. These PVL-positive CA-MRSA are easily transmissible not only within families but also on a larger scale in community settings suchas prisons, schools and sport teams. Skin-to-skin contact involvingno abrasion and indirect contact with contaminated objects suchas towels, sheets, sport equipment seem to represent the mode oftransmission. The skin infection often has the initial appearance ofan insect bite. In the US, infected prisoners were thought to havebeen bitten by spiders, and in our institution, a skillful technicianswho had been working for several years with PVL positive CA-MRSAthought she had been bitten by a mosquito before developing a largeforearm skin abscess which required surgical treatment. The exact prevalence of CA-MRSA is still unknown, as the isolatedstrains have mainly been taken from patients requiring admissionto hospital. These isolates collected at hospitals certainly representthe tip of the iceberg of the entire population of the CA-MRSA spreading in each continent. The most prevalent clone of CA-MRSAstrains, assigned to the multilocus sequence type 0 (ST 80), havebeen detected in several European countries, demonstrating its epidemicpotential.. It has been detected in rance, Switzerland,Germany, Greece and also the Nordic countries that were initiallyprotected rom the HA-MRSA invasion. Another clone (ST30), initially described in Australasia is reported in this issue ofEurosurveillance to have spread both in the Netherlands and in Latvia [1,2], demonstrating the intercontinentalspread of this clone. Similarly the ST8 and ST59clones, initially described in the US, have been reported in the Netherlands by Wannet et al [2].The small-sized SCCmec type IV element uniformly present in CA-MRSA reported so far is no longer auniversal feature of CA-MRSA, as Wannet et al report the presence of SCC mectype I and III in some of their strains. Although MRSA has been described for decades in hospital settings, these strains never previously appeared to represent a threat to the community. Currently, thethreat appears to be that strains that first emerged in the communitywill spread further within the community, and may potentiallyspread to hospitals too [1]. Will all S. aureus strains progressively become resistant to methicillin? The first priority is to set up and implement adequate prevention measures to reduce or limit the spreading of these strains. In pastoutbreaks when cases of skin and soft tissue infections have beenobserved in a close-living community of patients, conventional therapeutic and infection control measures have proven successfulin curing the infected patients and controlling the outbreak. The mainquestion now is how to prevent transmission of these strains in theopen community. CA-MRSA isolates collected at hospitals certainly represent the top of the iceberg of the entire population spreading in each continent References 1.

The aim is to include 1 to 2% of specialistsin each province. Each data-collection period covers 4 months,from September until January. Since 2004, this period has been extended to March. This intermittent data-collection limits the workload for the clinicians. Respectively, 27, 39, 69 and 63 sites participated in the first, second, third and fourth periods of data collection. Data are collected monthly. Nine STIs (genital chlamy- dial infection, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis, genital herpes, syphilis,chancroid, warts (HPV), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and pediculosis pubis) are reported with a standardised protocol. Apatient is included when a new episode of one or more of the selectedSTIs is diagnosed during a consultation or a screening. Patients withrecurrent episodes of genital herpes and HPV are not included. Information collected includes age, gender, nationality, residence, education, sexual orientation, number of partners during the last six months, prostitution, sexual contact with drug users, and intra-venous drug use. Finally, serological status for HIV , HBV and HCV is collected [7,8]. Sentinel Laboratory NetworkOne hundred and sixteen sentinel laboratories report the number of detected cases of some selected infectious diseases to the IPH dailyor weekly. These represent 56% (116/206) of all laboratories for clinical microbiology in Belgium; they carry out on average around 70%of all microbiology analyses countrywide. Syphilis was not included on the list of diseases under surveillance as it was thought tobe of low importance. A letter was sent to the sentinel laboratories on3 May 2001, requesting that the number of syphilis cases diagnosed per month in each laboratory during the 12 months of2000 and the first 4 months of 2001 be reported. No specific definition of syphilis cases was provided in this letter. When not specifically mentioned, cases were ass umed to be active syphilis cases. When detailed laboratory results were provided, the following case definition of an active syphilis case was used: VDRL/RPR positive ortitre > 1:8 AND treponemal treponemafound in dark field microscopy. The VDRL/RPR titre of the case definition has been modified since the fourth quarter of 2001(VDRL/RPR titre > 1:4) [9]. ResultsMandatory notification Mandatory notification data showed a long period of low-level endemicity. Between 1995 and 2000, the annual number of syphiliscases ranged from 14 to 30 across the whole country. A sudden in-Over the past five years, a series of syphilis outbreaks mainly occurring among gay men have been observed in Europe [1-5]. Oneofthese outbreaks was reported in the city of Antwerp, Belgium, during the first quarter of 2001 [6]. This outbreak is still ongo-ing in 2004. Furthermore, active syphilis diagnoses reported by the Sentinel Laboratory Network rose by 89% in the country during the fourth quarter of 2003. An increase in Brussels was also ob- served during the same quarter (+300%; 24 cases reported). Overall, the sentinel network of clinicians reported that 93.4% ofpatients were male; among them, 79.9% were men having sex with men (MSM). The overall proportion of patients co-infected with were already aware of their HIV in- fection at the time they were diagnosed with syphilis. Euro Surveill 2004; 9(12):6-8 Published online Dec 2004 Key words : STIs, surveillance, Belgium Introduction Three complementary systems are responsible for syphilis surveillance in Belgium: the mandatory notifications to the HealthInspectorate, which was the only source of information on syphilis in the 1990's; the Sentinel Network of Clinicians for sexually transmittedinfection (STI) surveillance, which started to collect epidemiological data on incident cases of various STIs, including syphilis, in 2000;and the sentinel laboratory network, which included active syphilis on the list of infectious diseases under surveillance in 2001. In this paper,we describe the trends and epidemiological features of syphilis in Belgium, and we report recent changes in surveillance systems. Methods Mandatory notification Syphilis is a mandatory notifiable disease, along with two other STIs: gonorrhoea and hepatitis B. Notification has been required bylaw since 1945. All new cases have to be reported by physicians to theHealth Inspectorate. Sentinel Network of CliniciansThe Sentinel Network of Clinicians for STIs Surveillance was started in October 2000. It aims to determine STI incidence trendsand to monitor epidemiological profiles of STI patients. The networkis made up of voluntary participating gynaecologists, dermatologists, 6 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12* Scientific Institute of Public Health, Brussels, Belgium(50.5%). Among these HIV patients, 22 (23.9%) discovered their HIV infection at the time they were diagnosed with syphilis. Seventy patients (76.1%) were already aware of their HIV infection. Of the male cases diagnosed with syphilis, 147 (79.9%) were homo/bisexual men; 27 (14.7%) were heterosexual. Sexual orientationwas unknown in 10 cases (5.4%). The median age of homo/bisexualmen was 37 (range: 21-68). Seventeen homo/bisexual men (11.6%)mentioned only having had one partner during the last six months,50 patients (34.0%) had had two partners or more; the number ofpartners is unknown in 54.4% of cases. 27.5% of homo/bisexualpatients reported having a genital ulcer (others symptoms are notspecified on the form). A history of hepatitis B (clinical or serological)was mentioned by 25.9% of homo/bisexual men; 23.8% were immunised against HBV and 28.6% were unaware of their status. HIV status was available for 95.2% of homo/bisexual men diagnosed with syphilis; the HIV prevalence in this group was 58.6%.Eighteen patients (22.0%) were diagnosed with HIV at the time of the syphilis diagnosis, seven (8.5%) had recently been diagnosed(within 3 months), and 57 patients had been aware of their HIV status for more than 3 months. Six out of eight homo/bisexual menfrom south America were HIV-positive and one of them, aged 26,was a commercial sex worker. Among the 27 male heterosexual patients, 7 reported having had sexual intercourse with prostitutes during the last 6 months; one ofthem was HIV co-infected. The median age of heterosexual men was40 (range: 22-70). One female patient diagnosed with syphilis was HIV co-infected (8.3%) [TABLE]. Another woman aged 16, and who had tested HIV-neg-ative, reported commercial sex work. Both were of sub-Saharan origin. DiscussionThe enhanced surveillance systems have made it possible to provide a more complete and precise description of the syphilis situation in Belgium. The mandatory notification system was the firstto report the outbreak of syphilis; it provides data over long periods but it often suffers from under-reporting and lack of precision. The reporting of syphilis diagnoses by the Sentinel Laboratory Network, which started in 2001, tends to compensate for this. In 2000, theSentinel Network of Clinicians started to collect epidemiological dataon incident STI cases, such as sexual orientation, risk behaviours and co-infections, which were not covered by the other systems; further- more, it collects data on a list of nine STIs. The different systems,which provide complementary information, will have to be consoli-dated in future.The characteristics of the outbreaks observed in Belgium and in other European countries are comparable in manyaspects, such as incidence trends, sex ratio, proportion of MSM [1-3:5] and HIV co-infection 3.5 (91/170) Heterosexual 10 11.1 (1/9) Unknown 3 0.0 (0/3) Total1 3 8.3 (1/12) Total1 97 50.5 (92/182)TABLE Sexual orientation and % HIV co-infection of patients diagnosed with syphilis reported by the Sentinel Network ofclinicians, Belgium, October 2000 - March 2004crease took place in 2001: 271, 204 and 300 cases were reported in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. This increase was linked to asyphilis outbreak in the city of Antwerp. During the first quarter of2001, 51 cases of syphilis were notified to the Health Inspectorate ofAntwerp. Of these patients, 32 were gay men who had been infected in Antwerp [6]. Sentinel Laboratory NetworkThe Sentinel Laboratory Network has reported an increasing number of active syphilis diagnoses since the beginning of 2001: 131, 159 and 216 cases were reported in 2001, 2002 and 2003,respectively. Another increase was observed during the fourth quarter of 2003. The number of reported cases nearly doubled (+91%) during the period from October 2003 to March 2004 in comparisonwith the period from April to September 2003 [10]. This recent trend is mainly attributable to the number of cases diagnosed in the 'arrondissement' (district) of Antwerp and in Brussels. [FIGURE].Between October 2003 and March 2004, 106 cases were diagnosedin the district of Antwerp and in Brussels, which account for 58.9%of the cases reported in Belgium. However, more cases were alsodiagnosed in the other 41 districts on the country, especially in thecities of Li\u00e8ge and Charleroi. The overall male/female ratio of cases reported by the Sentinel Laboratories is 5.6 to 1. The median age of male cases was 37,ranging from 16 to 82; the median age of female cases was 32, ranging from 16 to 81. Sentinel Network of CliniciansThe Sentinel Network of Clinicians reported 197 active syphilis cases between October 2000 and March 2004. The majority ofpatients were male (93.4%). Among male patients, 76.1% wereBelgian, 9.8% reported another European nationality, and 4.3%were of south American nationality. Among the female diagnoses, 7 stated an African nationality (53.8%.). HIV status was available in 182 cases (92.4%) [TABLE]. Ninety- five patients (52.2%) were tested at the time of the consultation, 16(8.8%) had recently been tested (within 3 months of the consultation time), and the result of testing three months before the consultation was reported in 71 cases (39%). The HIV status of patients tested in the past was based on lab documents or was self-reported. Overall, a positive HIV result was reported in 92 cases EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 7Syphil is in Europe FIGURE District of residence of diagnosed syphilis cases reported by the Sentinel Laboratory Network, Belgium,January 2001 Other 41 districtsORIGINAL ARTICLES Surveillance report SYPHILIS SURVEILLANCE IN FRANCE , 2000-2003 Couturier1, A for sexually transmitted infections: a timely and appropriate intervention.

From epidemiological synergy to public health policy and practice: the contribution of other sexually transmittend dis- eases to HIV transmission. Sex Transm Infect . 1999;(75):3-7 .The syphilis trends observed, the spread to other geographic locations, and the high rate of co-infections with HIV in particular, are worrying. The increasing incidence of syphilis may indicatechanges in sexual behaviour, especially among MSM and people who are aware of their HIV infection. Furthermore, the presence ofsyphilis may lead to future increases in HIV incidence, by facilitatingHIV transmission and susceptibility [11]. In addition to consistent surveillance, integrated HIV-STI prevention programmes have to be reinforced. Finally, no effort should be spared to diagnose and treat cases of syphilis as early aspossible.

The ongoing surveillance system for syphilis case reporting since 2001 has been set up in volunteer settings, mostly publi c settings where STI treatment is offered. Clinical case repo rting is complemented by sexual behavioural data based on a self-administered questionnaire. From 2000 to 2003, 1089 syphilis cases were reported in France,increasing from 37 cases in 2000 to 428 in 2003. Overall, 96% ofsyphilis cases were in men with a mean age of 36.5 years and 70% of whom were born in France. The proportion of syphilis cases with HIV co-infection decreased over time from 60% in 2000 to 33% in 2003. The most affected area by the syphilis epidemic is the Ile-de-France region, mainly the city of Paris. The greatest proportion of syphilis cases diagnosed in menwho have sex with men (MSM) were in the Ile-de-France region,where they made up 87% of cases, compared with 75% in otherregions. Among the patients who completed the self-adminis- tered quest ionnair e on sexual behaviour, 83% reported having casual sex partners in the 3 months prior to their syphilis diagno sis. Trends in the sales of benzylpenic illin benzathine 2.4 million UI in private pharmacies are similar to those observed in thesurveillance system, and incr eased between 2001 and 2003. In conclusion, syphilis transmission is still ongoing in Francein 2003 and the role of unprotecte d oral sex in the transmission of syphilis should be emphasised. Euro Surveill 2004; 9(12):8-10 Published online Dec 2004 Key words : Syphilis, surveillance, MSM, France Introduction In France, treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STI) is mainly provided by private general practitioners and gynaecologists.Less than 20% are diagnosed in STI clinics, which are publicly funded with free diagnosis and treatment [1]. Unlike some other countries, partner notification of infected patients is not implemented as aroutine public health intervention to control STIs. Two tests have to1. Institut de de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de dermatologie, Paris, France be carried out for serology testing: a nontreponemal test (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, benzathine UI a single dose is the recommendedtreatment for infectious syphilis. Required by law since 1942, mandatory notification of syphilis was abandoned in 2000 because syphilis was a rare disease andpoorly reported by private physicians. In 1978, 80% of syphilis caseswere diagnosed by private physicians, but more than 90% of notifications came from STI clinics [2]. No national syphilis trends are available after 1990, but data from Paris STI clinics revealed that syphilis cases declined evenly from 1980 [3]. By the late 1990s, less than 40 cases by year were reported(unpublished data, Direction de l'Action Sociale, de l'Enfance et dela Sant\u00e9, Paris). In November 2000, an unusual number of infectious syphilis cases were diagnosed in one Parisian STI clinic in a short timeperiod. The resurgence of infectious syphilis was confirmed and asurveillance system was set up in 2001 [4]. In this article, we describe syphilis trends, characteristics of patients (2000-2003) and trends of the benzylpenicillin benzathine2.4 million UI sales (2001-2003) in France. Methods Since 2001, the ongoing surveillance system for syphilis case reporting has been set up in volunteer settings, mainly public as STI clinics, hospital outpatient consulta tions (dermatology, infectious diseases) and in an existing Parisian network of private practitioners. A standard infectious syphilis case definition includes primary, secondary and early latent syphilis ( 1 year of infection) (4). After patient's informed consent, data collected by the provider at initialexamination includes: age, gender, district code of residence, country of birth, sexual orientation, syphilis stage, dark field and serologictest results (TPHA, VDRL, HIV), and, for HIV positive patient, if there is an ongoing antiretroviral treatment. Behavioral data complement case-reporting. A short anonymous self-administered questionnaire is offered to the patient focusingon sexual behaviors and preventive attitudes (number of sexualpartners, condom use, sexual practices). From 2001 to 2003, monthly sales of benzylpenicillin benzathine 2.4 million UI were obtained from a centralised wholesaler supplyingall French private pharmacies. Data are available by French maincities and by region. France is divided into 22 administrative regions,the city of Paris belongs to the Ile-de-France region. ResultsFrom 2000 to 2003, 1089 syphilis cases were reported, 37 cases in 2000, 207 in 2001, 417 in 2002 and 428 in 2003. Between 2000 and2003, each year, more than half of the cases were diagnosed in the Ile-de-France region but the proportion decreased from 81% to64% (p <10 -3). Each year, more than 96% of the cases of the Ile-de- France region were diagnosed in Paris. The number of participating se ttings has increased over time, from 10 in 2000, 29 in 2001, 42 in 2002 to 49 in 2003. In the Ile-de-France region, the number of settings was quite stable over time and the increase in participation was mainly in the other regions. We further analysed syphilis trends using data from settings with continuous participation 5 in the 5 regions, thenumber of syphilis cases doubled from 2001 to 2002. In 2003, it decreased (- 15%) in Paris and increased (+ 15%) in the 5 regions.Among the 1 089 cases, 25.8% (281) had primary syphilis, 42.4% (462) secondary syphilis and 31.8% (346) an early latent syphilis. Between 2000and 2002, the proportion of early latent syphilis increased (13.5%,20.3%, 36.5%, p<10-3) and was stable in 2003 (34.3%). The increasingtrend was significant only in the Ile-de-France region. Syphilis cases were mostly men (96%), the median age was 36; range 15-80, and more than 70% were born in France. Over time, the proportions of cases aged over 34 years were stable (40.5%, 47.8%,43.2%, 43.2%). Each year, more than 80% of the cases were men having sex with men (MSM). Overall, 49% of syphilis cases had a concomitant HIV infection. The proportion of syphilis cases with HIV infection decreased over time, from 60% in 2000 to 33% in 2003 (c2 for trend,p<10-3). Among them, 86% were aware of their HIV(+) status (stable proportions over time) and 71% were receiving antiretrovi-ral treatment at the time of syphilis diagnosis (stable proportions over time). MSM were more frequently HIV infected than heterosexuals,men or women [TABLE]. In the Ile-de-France region, 87% of syphilis cases were diagnosed among MSM compared to 75% among those of the other regions(p<10 -3). No differences according to age or proportions of HIV infected were seen between cases in the Ile-de-France region or inthe other regions (36.2 years vs 37.2 years; 50.3% vs AmongMSM, with HIVdecreased, from 72% in 2000 to 47% in 2003 (c 2for trend, p<10-3). This decreasing trend was significant in the Ile-de-France regionbut not in the other regions. Overall, 46% of the patients agreed to complete the self administered questionnaire. This percentage increased over timebut each year, participation was better in the other regions than in EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 9Syphil is in Europe FIGURE 1 Syphilis orientation, France, 2000-2003 Homo/ BisexualHeterose xual Male FemaleTotal HIV status N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) positive 482 (53.4) 17 (12.7) 3 (7 .0) 502 (46.5) negative 389 (43.1) 107 (79.9) 33 (76.7) 529 (49.0) not documented132 (3.6) 10 (7 .5) 7 (16.3) 49 (4.5) Total 903 (100) 134 (100) 43 (100) 10802(100) 1Not documented at time of syphilis diagnosis 2Gender not documented (n=1), sexual orientation not documented (n=8)syphilis intervention campaign (May to September 2002). The campaign was aimed at raising awareness about syphilis and encouraging those at risk to come for screening, target populationsbeing health professionals and MSM [5]. Free syphilis diagnosisand treatment were expanded at public clinics dedicated to HIVtesting. Increasing trends of early latent syphilis cases suggest a positive impact of the campaign, one of the key messages beingsyphilis could be asymptomatic. Moreover, the impact of this intervention was also seen on the sales of benzylpenicillin benzathine2.4 million UI suggesting that syphilis patients were treated by private providers. As in Paris, the syphilis campaign was also implemented in some main French cities but interventions could vary according to local decisions (e.g. free syphilis diagnosis). A survey (Barom\u00e8tre Gay) was conducted in gay venues after the campaign (end of 2002). In a self-administered questionnaire, 3.9%of the respondents of the Ile-de-France region reported a syphilis diagnosis in the last 12 months compared to 1.3% of the other respondents [6]. Moreover, more than one third (37%) of those from the Ile-de-France region had done a syphilis test in the 12 previous months compared to 18% of those from the other regions.The syphilis epidemic in France is predominant among MSM ofwhom more than half are HIV positive. Among MSM, the decreas-ing trend in HIV co-infection among syphilis cases in the Ile-de-France region could be explained by the fact that before the campaign, a syphilis test was offered more frequently to HIV positive personsand after, widely offered to MSM even in the absence of symptoms. Analysis of the self-administered questionnaires associated to case reports suggested that unprotected oral sex is a risk behaviourfor syphilis. This has been also described in a study in the UnitedKingdom [7]. In the French study cited previously among gay venues attendees, no question about unprotected oral sex was asked but factorsindependently associated with reporting a diagnosis ofsyphilis (in the 12 previous month) were at least one unprotectedanal intercourse with casual partners in the last 12 months, an HIV(+) status and regular backroom attendance [6]. In conclusion, syphilis transmission is still ongoing in France in 2003. The voluntary syphilis surveillance system, despite its limits,fulfils the defined objectives. In the future and after an evaluation,the syphilis surveillance issues might change. Nevertheless, preven-tion programmes on syphilis and HIV infection should be sustainedamong high risk populations and the role of unprotected oral sexin the transmission of syphilis should be emphasised.

Both results did not change over time. Among those reporting casual partners, 14% reported one partner, 45% 2 to 5 partners, 24% 6 to10 partners and 17% more than 10 partners. From 2001 to 2003, morethan 50% of MSM reported knowing the person who was the sourceof infection. That person was reported as a steady partner for 23%of them and a casual partner for 77%. The casual were metin saunas/darkrooms (34%), places (21%). The comparison ofunprotected sexual practices with the person who was the source ofinfection reported as a steady or a casual partner was respectivelyexclusive oral sex (39% vs 60%), exclusive anal intercourse (3% vs 8%) and association of the two practices (58% vs 32%) (p = 0.03). In Paris and in the 5 regions, trends in the sales of benzylpeni- cillin benzathine 2.4 million UI in private pharmacies are similar tothose observed in the surveillance system. From 2001 to 2003, sales increased in Paris (+ 22%) and in the 5 regions (+ 10%) [FIGURE2]. For the French regions with no case reporting surveillance system, those sales are the only available indicator and they slightlyincreased (+ 5%) between 2001 and 2003. DiscussionIn France, withdrawal of syphilis mandatory notification and resurgence of syphilis occurred in 2000 and pinpointed the need to implement a surveillance system. For the first time, a French surveillance system is collecting clinical and behavioural data in volunteer, mostly public settings in charge of STI care. An additional system describing trends in the sales of benzylpenicillin benzathine is a surrogate for estimating syphilis care by privateproviders. Our findings are subject to limitations. First, case-reporting surveillance is based on the participation of volunteer settings and these are not representative of all settings treatingsyphilis patients in France. Second, benzylpenicillin benzathine 2.4million UI is the quasi-exclusive tr eatment of but other rare indications exist as rheumatic fever, streptococcal diseases, and nonvenereal endemic syphilis. The Ile-de-France region, mainly the city of Paris, was the area most affected by the syphilis epidemic. Between 2001 and 2002,part of the important increase in cases in Paris was due to a specific 10 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12FIGURE 2 Sales of benzylpenicillin SURVEILLANCE AND TRENDS OF THE SYPHILIS EPIDEMIC IN GERMANY SINCE THE MID -90 S U Marcus, V Bremer, O Hamouda* Recent surveillance reports from Europe and the United States show an increa se in syphilis cases. Accurate epidemiological information about the distribution of syphilis is important for targeting screen ing and intervention programmes. The German syphilis notification system changed in 2001 from physician to laboratory-based re porting, which is complemented by a newly introduced sexually transmitted infection (STI) sentinel system. After reaching an all time low during the 1990s, syphilisnotifications have increa sed significantly si nce 200 1, coin ciding with the introduction of the new reporting system. However,the in creased reported incidence is reflecting a true rise in the number of ca ses and is not predom inantly determined by more underreporting through the previous reporting system. The increase reflects syphilis outbreaks among men who havesex with men (MSM). The first of these outbreaks was observed in Hamburg in 1997. In 2003, incidence in men was ten times higher than in women. An estima ted 75% of syphilis cases are currently diagnosed among MSM. A high proportion (accordingto sentinel data, up to 50%) of MSM diagnosed with syphilis are HIV positive. The continuously high number of syphilis casesdiagnosed among hete rosexua ls in Germany in recent years compared with other western European countries may reflect the higher population movement between Germany and syphilis high incidence regions in south-east and eastern Europe. Euro Surveill 2004; 9(12):11-14 Published online Dec 2004 Key words : Syphilis, STI, MSM, Germany Introduction After a period of declining syphilis incidence in most of western Europe from the early 1980s until the late 1990s, reports about local outbreaks, mostly related to men who have sex with men, have beenpublished since the end of the 1990s [1]. In Germany, reporting ofsyphilis was mandatory for the physician treating the case, accordingto the Venereal Disease Act until the year 2000. In 2001 this law was replaced by the Protection against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), which requires laboratories to reportall positive laboratory syphilis results and additional clinical andepidemiological information provided by the treating physician [2]. EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 11Syphil is in Europe The new syphilis notification system in Germany The new syphilis notification system, introduced in 2001, is operated and maintained by the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) andis a passive, anonymous reporting system. All laboratories are requiredto report each positive syphilis laboratory result within two weeks using forms provided by the RKI. Laboratories are advised not toreport clearly identifiable follow-up tests of adequately treated patients. The form consists of one original page and two copiesbearing the same identification number, with instructions on howto complete them. The reporting laboratory completes the original page and posts this page directly to the RKI (reply postage paid). Onecopy remains with the lab to facilitate necessary clarifications. One copy is sent, in conjunction with test results, to the physician who completes the epidemiological and clinical section and sends the completed reporting form directly to the RKI. Identifying parameters for the patient, required for the anonymous reporting, are gender,month and year of birth and the first three digits of the five-digitpostal code. If the postal code of the patient is not provided, the codeof the physician or the laboratory is taken as surrogate. Laboratory and clinical parameters have been defined, which are required for a report to fulfil the case definition [BOX and TABLE 1]. Inconsistent and missing information is checked individually by phone as far as possible. One critical aspect of quality control of the data is checking for double (or multiple) reports, which is aided by an automatic searchtool of the database. Upon entering a new report, this search feature produces a list of reports with the same sex and birth date(month/year), containing several additional key parameters. Multiplereports of the same event can thus be excluded with high reliability. BOX Syphilis case definition /square4Laboratory confirmed diagnosis of syphilis by one of the following methods: - Direct diagnosis of Treponema pallidum by dark field microscopy, monoclonal antibody staining or PCR Or - Positive antibodies with at least two tests in different test cate- gories - Category 1: TPHA/TPPA, EIA, FTA-abs, IgG-Immunoblot anticardiolipin antibodies, quantitative VDRL > 1:4, RPR > 1:8 - Category 3: diagnosis treponema-specific IgM by Elisa, Immunoblot or19s IgM-FTA-abs Or /square4Incomplete antibody diagnosis together with typical clinical symptoms - One positive test result from any test of category 1 or 3 together with a physician report of a primary syphilitic lesion or syphilitic skin lesions* Robert Koch-Institut, Berlin, Germanywas followed by an increase of syphilis cases among men in Berlin in 1999 - it should be noted that since 2000, in the greater Frankfurt region, the increase of cases was not yet reflected by the surveillance system at that time, but was suggested by reports from dermato-venerological practices with mainly MSM patients and in Berlin it was supported by a shift in the male-to-female ratio of reported cases.The increase affected Cologne and some cities in the Ruhr regionfrom 2000-2001, and Munich as well as other cities in Bavaria fromearly 2002 [6]. The number of reports fulfilling the case definition increased continuously from 1687 in 2001 to 2422 in 2002 and to 2932 in 2003 [7]. The completeness of reporting has been checked and was above95% since the introduction of the new reporting system, thus onlya negligible part of the increase can be attributed to an increase ofthe number of laboratories that contributed reports. The clinical stage at diagnosis has remained relatively stable since 2001. The proportion with missing information decreased, whilethe proportion of latent syphilis increased [FIGURE 3]. Geographic and demographic aspects and affected populationsSyphilis cases, especially cases among MSM, are clustered in larger cities. The cities with the highest incidence rates are Frankfurt,Cologne, Berlin, Hamburg and Munich. The geographical patternIn addition to syphilis notification, a sentinel system for STIs was established in November 2002. Sentinel sites, which include privatepractices, hospital-based STI clinics and local health authorities, reportcases of syphilis and other STIs to the Robert Koch-Institut. Patients areasked to provide information on sexual behaviour and social status ona self-administered questionnaire. Details of the methods are reportedelsewhere [3]. In 2003, 311 cases of syphilis (11% of the notifications)were reported in parallel by the sentinel surveillance system. Development of the syphilis epidemic in Germany Time trends In the final years of the previous reporting system, about 1100- 1150 cases of syphilis (1.3-1.4/100 000) were inGermany [FIGURE 1]. Substantial underreporting was assumed;the proportion of unreported cases was estimated at about 30-40%of reported cases [4]. Reporting from the private health care sectorand syphilis diagnoses in MSM were probably under-represented inthe previous system, as indicated by the abrupt increase of casesfrom larger cities after introduction of the new reporting system, whilesyphilis incidence in women has remained stable at low levels[FIGURE 2]. On the other hand, since there was no case definitionand limited quality control of reports before 2001, there may havebeen over-reporting of serological ly reactive, but clinically inactive forms of syphilis, and there may have been double reporting mainlydue to referrals between the private and the public sector. The reported incidence of syphilis in Germany had been decreasing since the late 1970s and stayed stable at a low level throughout most ofthe 1990s until 2001 [FIGURE 1]. At the end of the 1980s the numberof cases fell notably among men, probably as a result of changedbehaviour in response to the emerging HIV/AIDS epidemic. Outbreaks of syphilis were observed in Hamburg since 1997 and in Berlin since 1999. These were outbreaks among MSM, with mostcases in the 30-40 year age group. According to a local study [3],a high percentage of cases (80%) in the Hamburg outbreak during1997-98 occurred among HIV positive MSM.

While syphilis incidence in women remained stable (0.68 per 100 000 population in 2001, 0.65 in 2003), the proportion of cases diagnosed in women decreased from 15.5% (2001) to 9.4% (2003).Accordingly, syphilis incidence in men increased from 3.3 per 100 000 population in 2001 to 6.5 in 2003. The incidence among males peaksin the age group 30-39 years (17.1/100 000), while among females the incidence peak has shifted from the age group 25-29years in 2001 to the age group 20-24 in 2003 (2.4/100 000). Before January 2001, with the previous notification system, no information was collected on the probable route of infection.Information on probable route of infection was available for 66% of the notifications made during 2003, up from 57% in 2001. Themost frequently reported route of transmission was sexual contactwith other men (76% in 2003, up from 61% in 2001 and 70% in 2002). If we assume that the cases with unknown risk have a similardistribution to those with a known route of transmission, it can beestimated that currently around 75% of all syphilis cases notified inGermany are related to sexual contact between men. This finding issupported by similar observations in the sentinel surveillance system.Heterosexual contact is reported as infection risk in 23% of notifications with risk information. In the years 2001-2003, 23 casesof congenital syphilis in newborns were reported. Most of thesechildren were born to mothers originating from countries other than Germany, which resulted in limited or delayed access to pre-natal care. In some cases, a first screening test in early pregnancywas negative and infection occurred during pregnancy. Compared with the general populat ion, a disproportionately high share of women with syphilis, and of patients with heterosexualintercourse as reported route of transmission, originate from centraland eastern European countries [TABLE 2]. In self-defined homo- and bisexual men, who make up about 3-4% of the adult male population [7,8], syphilis incidence is muchhigher than in the rest of the population. In the most heavily affectedgroup of homosexual men between 30 and 39 years old, the nation- wide incidence of syphilis is estimated to be about 100 cases/100 000. In metropolitan areas, the incidence of syphilis is up to seven times higher [FIGURE 2], but also the proportion of MSM in thepopulation is probably about double that in towns and villages.Among HIV-positive MSM, who are disproportionally over- represented among MSM with syphilis (between 40-50% according to sentinel surveillance data), incidence rates above 1000/ 100 000 have been reached. In a recently conducted sexual behaviour surveyamong MSM, which probably oversamples HIV-positive men, 8%of 2002 [9]. DiscussionThe new laboratory-based reporting system for syphilis was introduced in Germany at a time of successive outbreaks of syphilisamong MSM. Because of this coincidence, and because underreportingin the previous system was expected especially from the private sectorwhere most MSM are diagnosed and treated, a reliable estimate offormer underreporting rates with the physician-based reporting systemis not possible. Since the increase of reported cases of syphilis coincided with the implementation of the new reporting system, it was necessary toinvestigate whether the increase reflected an actual rise in the numberof syphilis cases or resulted from the change of the reporting procedure.Both factors seem to play a role. Since the implementation of the newsystem, the notifications of syphilis have not increased in all regions,but mainly in metropolitan areas. The increase was less abrupt inHamburg compared to other large cities, probably because the local outbreak investigation [5] had led to improved reporting comparedto other cities. The increase has been continuous since the introduction of the new reporting system, with only a very slight increase in the EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 13Syphil is in Europe TABLE 2 Reported syphilis diagnoses among women by year of report and country/region of origin, Germany, 2001-2003 Region of origin 20 01 2002 2003 Germany 87 97 81 Central-/eastern Europe 66 62 55Other regions 11 19 17Not reported 105 142 120 Total 269 320 273 050010001500200025003000 2001 2002 2003 Year Number of diagnoses primary secondary latent congenital not reported FIGURE 3 Distribution of reported syphilis diagnoses by stage of infection, Germany, 2001-2003 FIGURE 4 Geographical pattern of syphilis incidence by postal code areas(smoothed), Germany, 2003 Hamburg HanoverBerlin Leipzig Dresden FrankfurtCologne Stuttgart Munichincidence per 100,000 population 0 to 0,01 0,01 to 0,10,1 to 11 to 1010 to 100ORIGINAL ARTIC LES Surveillance report THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF INFECTIOUS SYPHILIS IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND M Cronin1, L Domegan1, L Thornton1, M Fitzgerald2, P O'Lorcain2, E Creamer2, D O'Flanagan1of a consultation fee of \u20ac10 per quarter year for every consultation with a physician) and reductions in public investment in public health (i.e. budget reductions and reduced staff for local health offices, resulting in restriction of STI services instead of expansion).

Private practices and STI clinics in affected areas report a significant increase in syphilis infections especially in MSM since about the year 2000, while the incidencerates for women before and after 2001 are similar. The steep increases in syphilis incidence rates among MSM in large cities are in line withthe trend seen in other European countries and in North America [3,4]. The current syphilis epidemic in Germany, as reflected by the new reporting system, is characterised by successive outbreaks ofsyphilis among MSM in all larger cities in Germany, resulting in asustained increase in syphilis incidence levels in this populationgroup. The absolute number of heterosexually transmitted cases of syphilis in Germany seems to be relatively stable, though theproportion of heterosexual cases is decreasing. However, the relativelyhigh number of heterosexually transmitted cases seems larger thanin many other western European countries, probably reflecting theimpact of population movement between syphilis high incidenceregions such as eastern and south-eastern Europe and Germany. Increasing awareness of the re-emergence of syphilis in Germany, as reflected by high media coverage, syphilis-awarenessadvertisements in the gay press and increased distribution ofwritten information materials on STIs to MSM, has so far been insufficient to curb the spread of syphilis among MSM. Othercontrol measures like increased offers for screening sexually active MSM have been recommended in a common statement of theRKI, the German STD society and the German AIDS society.Introduction of such measures as well as an increase of low threshold STI screening and treatment facilities was also discussedbetween the RKI, self-help organisations of gay men and localhealth offices in larger cities. However, the implementation ofthese measures is severely hampered by efforts to reduce health carespending (formally not allowing routine screening procedurespaid by health insurance except in pregnant women; introduction 14 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12In response to the increasing numbers of syphilis cases reported among MSM in Dublin, an Outbreak Control Team (OCT) was set up in late 2000. The outbreak peaked in 2001 and had largely ceased by late 2003. An enhanced syphilis surveillance system wasintroduced to capture data from January 2000. Between January 2000 and December 2003, 547 cases of infectioussyphilis were notified in Ireland (415 were MSM). Four per cent ofcases were diagnosed with HIV and 15.4% of cases were diagnosed with at least one other STI (excluding HIV) within the previous 3 months. The mean number of contacts reported by male cases in the 3 months prior to diagnosis was 4 (range 0-8) for bisexual contacts and 6 for homosexual contacts(range 1-90). Thirty one per cent of MSM reported having hadrecent unprotected oral sex and 15.9% of MSM reported having had recent unprotected anal sex. Sixteen per cent of cases reported having h ad sex abroad in the three months prior to diagnosis. The results suggest that risky sexual behaviour contributed to 1.

Euro Surveill 2004; 9(12):14-17 Published online Dec 2004 Key words : Syphilis, MSM, STI, Ireland Introduction Since 1996, increases in syphilis have been reported in several northern and western European Union (EU) countries [1,2].Outbreaks of infectious syphilis have been reported in many cities,mostly among men who have sex with men (MSM), associated withhigh-risk sexual behaviour, use of novel sexual networks andrecreational drugs [3-6]. In Ireland, a changing pattern of syphilis became apparent in late 2000 with reports from sexually transmitted infection (STI)clinics of increased cases in MSM [7-9]. This was against a lowbackground rate of reported syphilis cases throughout the 1990s,which in 1999 reached its lowest level in 10 years (six cases, 0.2/100000). The escalating numbers of syphilis infections reported amongMSM in Dublin led to the setting up of a multidisciplinary outbreakcontrol team (OCT) by the Director of Public Health, Eastern Regional Health Authority, in October 2000. Interventions established by the OCT included, provision of additional resources for clinical services, employment of a designated Health Advisor for syphilispartner notification/contact tracing. In addition education materialand alerts for health professionals, targeted information campaignsand outreach work among the MSM community in Dublin, andonsite testing in gay bars, clubs and saunas were put in place [10,11].The outbreak peaked in 2001 and had largely ceased by late 2003. Surveillance of syphilis in Ireland Syphilis has been notifiable in Ireland since the introduction of statutory notification of infectious diseases in 1947. Aggregate STI databy age group, by year of notification and by gender are reported by STI clinics to local Departments of Public Health on a quarterly basis.Departments of Public Health also receive occasional data from generalpractitioners and other clinicians. Quarterly reports are compiledfor each health board/health authority by Departments of PublicHealth and forwarded to the National Disease Surveillance Centre (NDSC). National quarterly reports are produced by NDSC and areposted on the website (http://www.ndsc.ie). An amendment to the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 [12], which became operational on 1 January 2004, introduced arequirement for laboratory directors in addition to clinicians to notify certain infectious diseases, including syphilis. The amendment introduced, for the first time in Ireland, the use of case definitions inline with standardised European Union case definitions for infectiousdiseases. Materials and MethodsIn response to the increase in the number of reported cases, an enhanced surveillance system was introduced to capture data on allsyphilis cases diagnosed in Ireland from January 2000. An enhancedsurveillance form was designed in consultation with STI cliniciansand the Departments of Public Health. Data collected on the form included: core demographic details (including age, gender, countryof birth and health board area of diagnosing clinic), sexual orien-tation, socioeconomic status, drug use, clinical details, data on pre-vious and concurrent infections, recent and previous sexual history including the number of sexual contacts and relevant social venues,networks, commercial sex activity (purchaser or provider) andwhether protection (oral/anal/vaginal) was used. Forms were completed by clinicians and forwarded to Directors of Public Health and thence to NDSC. A Microsoft Access database was designed atNDSC for data storage and analysis. Data security and confidentialitywere maintained at all times as per the International Standard 17799 [13]. For the purposes of this paper, data have been analysed as infectious (including primary, secondary and early latent) and non-infectious (including late latent and tertiary) syphilis [14]. Datapresented in this paper include infectious syphilis cases reported toNDSC between January 2000 and December 2003. It should benoted that data for 2003 are provisional. Rates per 100 000 population are calculated using the 2002 Central Statistics Office(CSO) population census. ResultsBetween January 2000 and December 2003, 887 cases of syphilis were notified to NDSC through the enhanced syphilis surveillance system of which five hundred and forty seven were infectious syphiliscases.

Twenty one per cent (13/63) offemale heterosexual (8/51) of bisexualcases self-reported having had unprotected vaginal sex in the threemonths prior to diagnosis. Discussion and conclusionsThere was a dramatic increase in reported numbers of syphilis cases in Ireland between 2000 and 2003 [7]. Many of the character-istics of the outbreak of infectious syphilis in Dublin in 2002 are similar to those of outbreaks of syphilis reported from other cities inEurope[2,3,15,16]. Almost a third (31%) of MSM with a diagnosis of infectious syphilis reported having had unprotected oral sex and 16% reportedhaving had unprotected anal sex, in the three months prior to diagnosis. It should be noted that as the numbers having unprotectedoral, anal and vaginal sex are self-reported, the numbers are likelyto be an underestimate. In addition, the reported numbers of recent sexual partners among infectious syphilis cases suggests that riskysexual behaviour contributed to the onward transmission of infec-tion in Dublin. It is notable that 16.5% of infectious syphilis cases in Ireland reported recent sexual contact abroad, in particular in London, Manchester, Amsterdam and Barcelona. Syphilis outbreaks have also been reported from London, Manchester and Barcelona[5,15,17]. The outbreak of syphilis in Dublin could thus be seen aspart of a Europe-wide outbreak of syphilis. The EuropeanSurveillance of Sexually Transmitted Infections (ESSTI) Network re- cently established a working group to consider current EU HIV/STI prevention activities among MSM in response to reported increasesin syphilis, HIV and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) amongMSM in EU countries [18].The numbers of infectious syphilis cases peaked in July 2001 [FIGURES 1,2]. The number of infectious cases by stage, symptoms,gender, mean age and range and sexual orientation are outlined inTable 1. MSM cases peaked in Quarter 3, 2001 and heterosexual cases in Quarter 1, 2002 [FIGURE 2]. Three hundred and seventy seven(68.9%) infectious syphilis cases were in patients born in Ireland, ofwhich 315 (83.6%) were reported to be MSM, 60 (15.9%) tp be heterosexual and two to be of unknown sexual orientation. Ninetynine (18.1%) cases were in patients born outside Ireland; 54 (54.5%)of these were in MSM, 43 (43.4%) were heterosexual and two wereof unknown sexual orientation. Data on country of birth was miss-ing for 71 (13.0%) infectious syphilis cases. HIV status and concurrent STIs Infectious syphilis was diagnosed in ninety three HIV positive individuals (85 MSM and 8 heterosexuals). HIV was co-diagnosed (diagnosed within three months of syphilis diagnosis) in 19 (3.5%)infectious syphilis cases. Thirteen cases infected with HIV and infectious syphilis were also concurrently diagnosed with anotherSTI. Seven cases were co-diagnosed with infectious syphilis, HIV andgonorrhoea. Eighty four (15.4%) infectious syphilis cases were co-diagnosed with at least one other STI (excluding HIV). Nine (1.6%)infectious syphilis cases were co-infected with two or more STIs (excluding HIV). One hundred and sixty three patients (29.8%) withcases of infectious syphilis gave a history of having had an STI in thepast, and 88.3% of these cases were in MSM. Risk behaviour Six male patients with cases of infectious syphilis self-reported that they were either currently working or had worked in past in thecommercial sex industry. Fourteen cases reported sexual contact with a commercial sex worker (CSW) in the past (eight male cases withmale CSWs and six male cases with female CSWs). In order to try to identify the source of infection, patients were asked if any relevant network or place was implicated. The numberof cases by venues or social networks implicated in the acquisitionof infection is set out in Table 2. Ninety (16.5%) cases had had sex abroad in the three months prior to diagnosis (contacts in London, Manchester, Barcelona and Amsterdam were reported). The mean number and range of sexual contacts in the three months prior to diagnosis for male and fe- male cases is outlined in Table 3.

A review from the United States considered 30 studies that looked at HIV rates in people with syphilis in the US [19]. They reported an overall median prevalence for HIV of 15.7%. Highly active antiretroviral therapy(HAART) has dramatically reduced deaths from HIV , and the numbers of people living with HIV have risen substantially. A recently published report from the United States Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) highlights concern in relation to outbreaks of primary and secondary syphilis among MSM and concurrent increases in newly diagnosed HIV infections among MSM. The availability of HAART and 'safe sex message fatigue' may be partlyresponsible for increased risk-taking in sexually active homosexual men [20]. Prevention programmes need to take into account under-lying attitudes towards unprotected sex in the era of HAART amongboth HIV-infected and uninfected me n and require evaluation in relation to their effectiveness in creating awareness and reducing infection risk. Continued enhanced surveillance indicates that the outbreak is over but syphilis rates remain at a much higher level than previously. The increasing numbers of cases led to the introduction of a nationalenhanced surveillance system by the NDSC to capture data on allsyphilis cases from January 2000. Surveillance systems must be ableto detect localised changes in incidence in a timely fashion, and rapidly implement measures to both understand transmission dynamics and implement appropriate targeted responses [21]. There is a need to improve surveillance systems in order to allow real timeevaluation of interventions and ongoing monitoring of infection trends. The collection of disaggregate data in electronic format would greatly increase the power of routine STI surveillance and such a system, the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) system [22,23], has been developed in Ireland and it is anticipatedthat the system will be rolled out countrywide over the next two years.

The Czech Republic has a long tradition of pub-lic health care activities including a surveillance system for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This system focuses on mainly the syphilis, gonorrhoea, the 1950swere successful in controlling syphilis and gonorrhoea infections (chancroid and lymphogranuloma venereum are extremely rare inthe Czech Republic, and nearly all cases reported are imported from endemic areas). These aims were supported by legislative measuresand the careful work of medical staff, both in clinical and epidemio- logical departments. A fairly low incidence of newly reported syphilisinfections was achieved by the late 1980s, with 100-200 cases per yearand around 6500 cases of gonorrhoea per year for the same period. Methods D i a g n o s t i c a n d s u r v e i l l a n c e s y s t e mAccording to Czech legislation, the following venereal diseases are mandatorily reportable with full patient identification under the ICD-10 (A50 - A 53), 55), and chancroid - ulcus molle(A 57). No case may be registered without laboratory verification.Verification of clinical status is based on direct detection by cultureor molecular biology methods (gonorrhoea and lym-phogranuloma venereum EIA, etc.) with confirmatory level ones (FTA-ABS,western blot, etc.) is required. Health care and prevention of vene- real diseases and other STIs, including chlamydial, mycoplasma, herpes simplex virus and human papillomavirus infections, arebased on close cooperation between clinical departments and laboratories and epidemiological services of environmental healthoffices. Syphilis may be clinically diagnosed with the support of ant body detection or serologically only - during the latent stages of illness,Syphilis remains a public health problem in the Czech Republic and worldwide. The Czech Republic - until 1993 a part of Czechoslovakia - has a long tradition in public health activities, and STI su rveillance is mainly focused on the infections traditionally called 'venereal diseases' - syphilis, gonorrhoea, chancroid, and lymphogranuloma venereum. Campaigns from the early 1950s, were successful in controlling syphilis and gonorrhoea; and chancroid and lymphogranuloma venereum infections are extremely rare. In late 1980s, a low incidence of newly reported syphilis cases was achieved (100-200 cases annually), while around 6500 cases of gonorrhoeawere recorded annual ly during the same period. Health care and prevention of STI diseases in the Czech Republic are based on close cooperation between clinical departments and labora- tory and epidemiological services of Environmental HealthOffices. Annual statistics showing data on reported cases of'venereal diseases', based on ICD-10 codes, are available from1959. Separate statistical data on other STIs are not available, and aggreg ated numbers only for Chlamydia trachomatis infections have been presented annually since 2000 [5]. Following the political and social changes in the Czech communi ty in 1989, a distinct increase of syphilis was recorded. Between 50% and 60% of notified cases were classified as latelatent or of unknown duration. The continuing annual occurrence of congenital syphilis (7-18 cases per year) reported during the 1990s has also been a very serious phenomenon.Cases have been concentrated in large urban areas with a high level of commercial sex activity, and a high proportion ofcases is also noted in refugees. While the annual incidence of gono rrhoea gradually decreased from 1994 to 2001 (from 28.5 to 8.9 per 100 000 population), the incidence of syphilis increased in this period from 3.6 to 9.6 per 100 000 population (the highest value was 13.4 in 2001) and in 2000,for the first time in many years, it exceeded the incidence of gonorrhoea. 18 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-1241.

Dermatovenerological Clinic, General Faculty Hospital Prague, Czech RepublicvAn improved software system was implemented at the beginning of 2003, which uses newly prepared tools for reporting and process- ing data and is more flexible. Other STIs are reported anonymously by clinicians annually, and basic aggregated data on chlamydial infections, stratified by sex, havebeen available since 2000. Results Trends in syphilis and gonorrhoea in the Czech Republic from 1994 to 2003 Between 1994 and 2004, the absolute number of reported gonorrhoea cases decreased each year (2948 cases in 1994, to 880 casesin 2001). During the same period, the incidence of syphilis increased in from 3.6 to 9.6 per 100 000 population (the highest valuewas 13.4 in 2001). The incidence of syphilis exceeded that ofgonorrhoea in 2000, for the first time in many years [FIGURE]. In 2002,there was a 3.5% increase in reported gonococcal infections,contrasting with a 30% decrease of syphilis cases compared with 2001 data [TABLE 1]. The number of notified cases in 2002 per 100 000 population was almost the same as in 2000. As in recent years, 50%-60% of syphilis cases were reported as late latent or of unknown duration [5]. No cases of chancroid or lymphogranuloma venereumwere reported, owing to their rare incidence in the Czech population. The congenital syphilis situation appeared to be slightly better in the period 2000-2002 than in preceding years [TABLE 1]. Risk groups for syphilis are still cohorts of men aged 20-24, 25- 29, and 30-34 years, with a peak at 30 years of age. Age distributionof women patients is wider, beginning in the 15-19 year age group,with the peak at 25 years of age [5]. Regional distribution both of syphilis and gonorrhoea is related to large urban centres and regions with high level of prosti- tution: this is demonstrated by the higher incidence per 100 000population [5]. The influence of inst itutions for refugees can also be seen in regional case reports [TABLE 2]. While the number of syphiliscases in foreigners with a short stay in the Czech Republic is low (forexample, tourists), the situation is different for immigrants per- mitted long term stay and asylum seekers [TABLE 2]. The this is more common. Direct (dark field microscopy, direct immunofluorescence microscopy) and indirect screening methodsand confirmatory tests (nontreponemal and treponemal serological tests) are in accord with those recommended by the WorldHealth Organization (WHO) and European authorities [1,2]. The direct tests are mainly performed at the bedside while patients areadmitted to the vene rological departments of hospitals, or at outpa- tient clinics. The indirect serological testing is provided by bloodbank, microbiological and serological laboratories (165 laborato- ries were cooperating in 2004), mostly on a screening level (nontreponemal tests - VDRL or RPR etc. + western blot IgG and IgM, ELISA IgM,IgM SPHA) are performed in the national reference laboratory or in other specialised centres. Mandatory syphilis testing is carriedout mainly for blood, tissue, sperm and organ donors, pregnantwomen (twice during pregnancy), all newborns, and patients suspected of venereal disease. The National Reference Laboratory forDiagnostics of Syphilis, set up in the 1970s, provides confirmatorytesting in hospitalised and follow-up patients, and provides a consultation service for laboratories and clinical departments. Each year, in cooperation with the National Institute of Public Health in Prague,it prepares samples for external quality control, and also participatesin the Syphilis Serology Proficiency T esting Program coordinated bythe WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research in SyphilisSerology at the United States Centers for Disease Control. Examination for gonorrhoea is based on clinical symptoms in suspect patients or in case-contact investigations. For laboratory confirmation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections, microbiological laboratories use culture, biochemical identification and drug susceptibility tests or PCR and hybridisation methods. Every reported case is laboratory confirmed. All clinicians and laboratories have a statutory obligation to complete case reports of syphilis, gonorrhoea, ulcus molle or lymphogranuloma venereum and send it to Departments ofEpidemiology of Environmental Health Offices. This system covers the entire Czech Republic. Diagnosis, treatment and follow-up are done at dermatovenerolog- icaldepartments of hospitals or outpatient clinics. Diagnosis and case report are based on clinical status and laboratory confirmation. Their professional level is guaranteed by the DermatovenerologicalSociety of the Czech Medical Association of J E Purkyne (Ceska LekarskaSpolecnost J.E. Purkyne) and by and lymphogranuloma each month from outpatient departments, hospital departmentsand laboratories by the environmental health offices' epidemiology departments in the 14 regions of the Czech Republic. The reports include information on diagnosis, treatment, patient information,including sex, age, ethnicity, educat ion level, sexual orientation, risky sexual behaviour, and pregnancy status. Accredited epidemi- ologists cooperate with clinicians and laboratories in checking re-ported data, namely confirmation of diagnosis, treatment andexamination of contact persons. This information is transferred to the National Registry of Venereal Diseases. Statistically processedanonymous data are classified by individual diagnosis, age, sex,patient's residence, etc., and the outputs are made available on aquarterly basis for regions, and annually for the entire country.Annual reports are edited by the Czech Ministry of Health's Institute of Health Information and Statistics. Relevant issues cover data onsyphilis, gonorrhoea, chancroid, and lymphogranuloma venereumgoing back to 1959.

Congenital syphilis is often diagnosed in pregnancies that have not been monitored, usually because of bad complianceby the pregnant woman. The newly implemented system for reporting and processing data should bring us better flexibility and variability of outputs. The spectrum of reported STIs will be extended, and these data will probably be collected anonymously. Future areas of priority include Neisseria gonorrhoeae drug resistance (most of patients are treated with tetracycline, azithromycin or by ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) and applyingsystematic measures to prevent congenital syphilis.

World Health Organization, Regional Office for Europe, CISID Home-STD and HIV/AIDS. http://www.cisid.WHO.dk/proportion of cases in immigrants rose from 27% in 1997 to 59% in 2001. Foreign patients come mainly from Ukraine (42%), Moldavia(12.5%), the Russian Federation (8%), and Georgia (8%). In every region, the majority of gonococcal infections are in men, and they represent a reservoir of infection, as reported in previous years [5]. The proportion of cases in foreigners does notexceed 10% annually. The majority of syphilis and gonorrhoea cases are reported in groups of unmarried patients. This seems to show that this population group is engaging in risky behaviour with multiple partners [5]. Conclusion A distinct increase in syphilis cases has been recorded since the political changes of 1989. The steady increase of congenital syphilis cases reported during 1990s was also alarming. The averageincidence of all stages of syphilis (not counting cases in foreigners)in the period 1994-2002 varied from 4 to 5.6 per 100 000population. The situation seems to be similar to that in other EUcountries [4,6,8], but in comparison with the Czech situation in the late 1980s, the situation undoubtedly worsened during 1990s. The mandatory serological testing for syphilis of asylum seekers must play a positive role in recognising infections, and gives this group better access to treatment and care than would otherwise be available. The current situation could be assessed as relatively favourable, and an improvement on that of the 1990s, probably due to better 20 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12Congenital syphilis**Year GonorrhoeaEarly syphilisLate syphilisSyphilis NS*** 13 (12.2) 250 (2.4) 55 (0.5) 51 (0.5) 2948 (28.5) 1995 12 (11.4) 294 (2.8) 61 (0.6) 66 (0.6) 2036 (19.7) 1996 10 (10.0) 391 (3.8) 80 (0.8) 70 (0.7) 1194 (11.6) 1997 16 (17 .6) 366 (3.6) 107 (1.0) 115 (1.1) 1098 (10.7) 1998 18 (19.9) 451 (4.4) 85 (0.8) 133 (1.3) 1055 (10.3) 1999 17 (19.0) 404 (3.9) 127 (1.2) 183 (1.8) 995 (9.7) 2000 11 (12.1) 472 (4.6) 17 (1.2) 357 (3.5) 888 (8.6) 2001 13 (14.3) 405 (3.9) 183 (1.8) 775 (7 .5) 880 (8.6) 2002 7 (7 .5) 304 (3.0) 154 (1.5) 511 (5.0) 911 (8.9) 2003* 11 (12.1) 838 (8.2) 1030 (10.1) * Only preliminary data is available ** The incidence of congenital syphilis per 100 000 population is 0.1 - 0.2*** Syphilis NS: illness of unknown duration.TABLE 1 Reported cases of syphilis and gonorrhoea (including foreigners), Czech Republic, 1994 - 2003 Reported cases (incidence per 100 000 population) TABLE 2 Reported cases of syphilis and gonorrhoea in foreigners, Czech Republic, 1994-2002 Gonorrhoea SyphilisResident foreigners Short-termed stay foreigners Gonorrhoea Syphilis 1994 NA NA 16 89 1995 NA NA 27 78 1996 NA NA 50 57 1997 70 62 91 49 1998 82 57 121 56 1999 130 61 151 37 2000 291 57 126 23 2001 731 81 87 102002 376 62 52 7 NA - not availableYearORIGINAL ARTICLES Surveillance report SYPHILIS SURVEILLANCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM A A Righarts1, I Simms1, L Wal lace2, M Solomou1, KA Fenton13 The aim of this article is to describe trends in infectious syphilis in the UK, and specifically the epidemiology of the London syphilis outbreak, the largest in the UK to date. Analysis of routine surveillance data from genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics was performed as well as data collec- tion through enhanced surveillance systems. There have been substantial increases in diagnoses of infec-tious s yphilis between 1998 and 2003, with a 25-fold increase seen in men who have sex with men (MSM) (from 43 to 1028 diagnoses); 6-fold (138 to 860) in heterosexual men and 3-fold (112 to 338) in women. The national rise in syphilis was drivenby a series of local outbreaks, the first of which occurred in1997. To da te, 1910 case s have been reported in the London outbreak, first detected in April 2001. High rates of HIV co-infection were seen among MSM, with MSM likely to be of white ethnicity and born in the UK. In contrast, heterosexu-als were more likely to be of black ethnicity and born outside the UK. Most syphilis infections were acquired in London. MSM bear the brunt of the national resurgence in infectioussyphilis. Substantial rises in male heterosexual cases has resulted in a divergence between male heterosexual and fe- male cases, which now requires further investigation. Euro Surveill 2004; 9(12):21-25 Published online Dec 2004 Key words : Syphilis, United Kingdom, MSM Introduction Against a backdrop of increasing diagnoses of acute STIs and HIV prevalence in the United Kingdom (UK), diagnoses of infec-tious syphilis have risen dramatically since 1998 [1]. This resurgencehas been facilitated by a number of outbreaks throughout the UK.The outbreaks have occurred mainly in men who have sex with men(MSM), and, more recently, in heterosexual men and women [2]. Comprehensive, existing routine STI surveillance systems from genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics are unable to provide timelydata in the context of a rapidly evolving epidemic; data often tak-ing a minimum of 6 months to collate. Therefore, enhanced syphilis surveillance systems were developed and implemented in order toimprove clinical case reporting. Similar enhanced surveillance systems now operate throughout the UK [2].The aim of this article is to describe the epidemiology of infec- tious syphilis in the UK in 2003. We also explore key features of theLondon infectious syphilis outbreak. Methods Routine surveillance of syphilis Routine surveillance data on STIs in the UK are derived from diagnoses made in GUM clinics reported on the KC60 form (ISD(D)5form in Scotland). GUM clinics have had a statutory obligation torecord data since 1917 [1]. Reliable trend data on primary, secondary and early latent syphilis diagnosed in GUM clinics extendback to 1931. GUM clinics in England, Wales and Northern Ireland return quarterly data to the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on totalepisodes by condition, sex and for selected conditions, by sexualorientation and/or age group. In contrast, Scottish data are episodebased and returned to the Information and Statistics Division (nowInformation Services) in Scotland. Reported data includes primary and secondary syphilis, early latent syphilis, other acquired syphilis(e.g. cardiovascular and syphilis, and epidemiological treatment of suspected syphilis [1]. Routine GUM data returns are often delayed; for example, complete KC60 data for 2003 is only available in June 2004. Similarly, difficul- ties extracting Scottish ISD(D)5 data have resulted in incomplete or nodata being available currently for 2001, 2002 and 2003. Data on syphilis and other STIs diagnosed at GUM clinics are made publicly available in a series of annual reports, on the HPA website (UKdata), and both the Information and Statistics Division (ISD) andScottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (now HealthProtection Scotland, HPS) websites (Scottish data only) [(3-5]. Enhanced surveillance initiatives In response to the resurgence in syphilis since the late 1990s, a number of enhanced surveillance initiatives were implemented. These initiatives were designed to provide prompt demographic,behavioural and clinical data in order to inform health planningand intervention strategies. The first enhanced surveillance programme commenced in Manchester in 1999 and was extendedto cover the North West region in 2003. The London Enhanced Syphilis Surveillance programme was established in 2001. This was subsequently extended to the rest of England and Wales in 2003[2]. A similar system, based on the London programme, was established in Scotland in late 2002; data were collected retrospec-tively to 2001 [6]. [T ABLE 1] shows the data collected for the London Enhanced Syphilis Surveillance Programme. Other initiatives collectsimilar data.

Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, Department of Primary Care and Population Sciences, Royal Free and University College Medical School, Mortimer Ma rket Centre, London, United KingdomThe distribution of regional patterns of syphilis diagnoses largely reflects the impact of outbreaks. In 2003, London accounted for 42% of diagnoses in MSM, 42% in heterosexual men and 52% in women. (18%, 12% and 8% in MSM, heterosexual menand women respectively) and South East regions of England (12%,10% and 11% in MSM, heterosexual men and women respectively)also accounted for a high proportion of diagnoses.Epidemiological features of the London outbreak were analysed with STATA v8.0, and chi squared tests were used to ascertain P- values for differences in proportions. Results OverviewDiagnoses in infectious (primary, secondary and early latent) syphilis declined rapidly during the 1980s with the advent ofHIV/AIDS and the subsequent introduction of HIV preventionstrategies aimed at sexual behaviour modification. A relatively lowlevel of diagnoses was maintained through most of the 1990s;between 1995 and 1998 an average of only 300 diagnoses were seenannually throughout the UK. The first outbreak of infectious syphilisoccurred in Bristol in 1997 [2]. This was followed by outbreaks inthe cities of Manchester [7], Brighton, Peterborough, London,Newcastle upon Tyne, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Walsall and the regions of south Wales and Northern Ireland [FIGURE 1]. Routine surveillance of syphilis in the UK GUM diagnoses of infectious syphilis are now at their highest levels in the UK since 1984. A total of 2233 diagnoses were made inGUM clinics during 2003; 1028 in men who have sex with men(MSM), 860 in heterosexual men, and 338 in women. Since 1998,there has been a 25-fold increase in MSM (from 43 to 1028diagnoses). R ises of a lower magnitude of 6-fold (138 to 860) and 3-fold (112 to 338) were seen in heterosexual men and womenrespectively (FIGURE 2). There is a continuing divergence in male heterosexual cases and female cases since 2000. In 2000, the ratio of heterosexual male tofemale cases was 1.2:1, in 2003 it was 2.5:1. Increases in infectious syphilis were mirrored in other forms of syphilis in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (Scottish ISD(D)5data not available in 2003). Other acquired syphilis rose by 108% (76to 158) between 1998 and 2003 in MSM, by 55% (564 to 874) in heterosexual men and 117% (376 to 817) in women. This wasaccompanied by small numbers of congenital syphilis cases. Therewere also increases in the epidemiological treatment of suspected syphilis from 0 cases in 1998 to 147 cases in 2003 in MSM, from 20to 109 case in heterosexual men and 36 to 67 cases in women. 22 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12FIGURE 2 Diagnoses of Infectious syphilis* made in GUM clinics, United Kingdom, 1995-2003 010020030040050060070080090010001100 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 YearDiagnosesMales - Heterosexua lMales - Homosexual Females * Infectious syphilis constitutes primary, secondary and early latent syphilis Data source: routine surveillance data, apart from Scotland for 2001, 2002 and 2003 where routine data were not available and data from the enhanced surveillance were used.

Thirteen percent of those diagnosed with infectious syphilis were either commercial sexworkers (CSW) or CSW clients. Only three percent of MSM had links with CSW Syphilis in heterosexuals When comparing syphilis cases in heterosexual men and women, men were significantly older than women and more likely to pres-ent with primary syphilis [TABLE 3].Two thirds of heterosexualmen attended due to symptoms, compared with just 30% of women.A further 29% of women attended due to other reasons (e.g. a positive antenatal screen). A higher proportion of heterosexualmen reported using venues/sexual networks for acquiring new partners (10% versus 3% in women), and oral sex being the likelymode of transmission (11% versus 4% in women). Heterosexualmen also reported higher numbers of partners: a median of two inthe previous three months versus a median of one in women.Age group data are currently only available for primary and secondary syphilis in England Wales and Northern Ireland. Unlikeother STIs, relatively few diagnoses were made in younger age groups.The highest rates of syphilis were seen in men aged 25 to 34 years(13.5 per 100,000) and 35 to 44 years (11.7 per 100,000). In womenthe highest rates were seen in those aged 20 to 24 years (2.5 per100,000) and 25 to 34 years (1.9 per 100,000) (8). Enhanced syphilis surveillance in London The London outbreak is the largest reported in the UK to date with 1910 diagnoses of infectious syphilis reported between April 2001and end September 2004. The characteristics of the outbreak weresimilar to those seen throughout the rest of the UK, other areas ofwestern Europe and the United States [2]. Infections are geograph- ically clustered, and associated with high rates of partner change incore risk groups, and concurrent HIV infection. Two epidemics are evident in London: one among MSM (1276 cases) and one among heterosexual men (383 cases) and women (237cases) (FIGURE 3). As seen in the routine surveillance data there isa disparity between heterosexual male and female diagnoses. In both MSM and heterosexuals the majority of cases attended GUM clinics with symptoms (61% and 53% respectively) or for routine asymptomatic screening (27% and 20% respectively). There were significant differences in the other characteristics of MSM and heterosexuals diagnosed with infectious syphilis [TABLE 3]. MSMwith infectious syphilis were older than heterosexuals, more likely to be HIV positive and more likely to present with secondary syphilis[TABLE 2]. Sixty-five per cent of MSM were born in the UK and 89%were of white ethnicity. In contrast, only 46% of heterosexuals were born in the UK and 44% were of white ethnicity. Most infections were acquired in London: 85% in MSM and 76% in heterosexuals. MSM were significantly less likely to acquire their infection abroad. In general, MSM reported higher prevalence of sexual risk behav- iour. They reported a higher number of sex partners (a median of threein the last three months compared with one in heterosexuals); and ahigher proportion used social venues/sexual networks for acquiring newpartners (36% versus 7% in with the commer- VOL.9 Issue 10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 23Syphil is in Europe FIGURE 3 Trends in diagnoses of infectious syphilis* in MSM (by HIV status) and heterosexual men and women, 6 month moving average; London April 2001 to end September 2004 02468101214161820 4 5 67 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 1112 123 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1112 1 2 345 6 7 8 9 Year and monthHeterosexual males Heterosexual females MSM (HIV positive) MSM (HIV negative) * Infectious syphilis constitutes primary, secondary and early latent syphilis2001 2002 2003 2004Number of casesTABLE 2 Comparison of characteristics of MSM and heterosexuals in the London outbreak, data to end September 2004 Heter osexual MSMSexual orientation P-value Age 5585 7% <0.001 Reason for attending (n, %) n=1274 Routine screen 341 27% 124 5% n=571 London 1001 8 5% 433 76% Rest of 4% 17 3%outside UK 123 11% 121 21% <0.001 %) n=1226 UK 65% 276 46%Rest of 17%Outside 16% 11% Caribbean 26 2% 170 28% Black other 17 1% 29 5% 2% 50 8%Other 61 5% 22 4% Use Social / Sexual networks foracquisition of n=1276 n=624new partners (n, %) 457 36% 46 7% <0.001 Patient was a commercial se x worker (CSW), or client of n=1276 n=624a CSW 34 3% 81 13% <0.001 Oral sex wa s the likely mode of n=974 n=448 acquisition (n, %) 426 44% 37 8% <0.001Number of sexual contacts in thepast 3 months n=1193 n=579 (median, range) 3 (0, 100) 1 (0, 302) <0.001epidemic in MSM is plateauing. However, this is not consistent throughout the UK, and preliminary 2004 data from enhanced sur-veillance in Scotland indicate continuing increases in MSM in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Nationally, our surveillance data confirm a continued divergence between diagnoses in heterosexual men and women; a trend also observed in London during 2002 and 2003 [FIGURE 2].The excess male cases may have resulted from the association between heterosexual outbreaks and the commercial sex industry. Thedivergence may also be due to differences in clinical presentation andhealth seeking behaviour [TABLE 4]. This conflicts with London enhanced surveillance [FIGURE 3], where some of the convergence maybe due to reporting bias. Key features of syphilis epidemiology in the UK include the geographical isolation of outbreaks, especially amongst MSM wherethere was little imported infection; localisation amongst CSW andtheir clients with a steady increase in heterosexual transmission, andthe high proportion of concurrent HIV infection in MSM. The potential impact of syphilis infection on HIV transmission is concerning, and further studies examining the impact on HIV A common feature of syphilis outbreaks in England is the high proportion of concurrent HIV infection in MSM diagnosed with infectious syphilis [2]. In London, 53% of MSM were HIV posi-tive; this has remained fairly stable throughout the outbreak. HIVco-infection in MSM with syphilis was strongly associated with age group, stage of syphilis infection, reason for attending, and use of sexual networks [TABLE 4]. Forty-one per cent of those with concurrent HIV infection frequented sexual venues compared with 31% in those who were HIV negative.

Comm un Dis 10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 25Syphil is in Europe Denmark is currently experiencing an outbreak of syphilis that began in 2003 and has continued in 2004. Data from the nationalsurveillance system show that most cases are in men who havesex with men (MSM), and that a large proportion of these patients are also HIV positive. The proportion of known HIV pos- itive cases in MSM notified with syphilis during the outbreak has, however, not been significantly different from previous years. The majority of cases were reported from Copenhagenmunicipality, and 70% of the cases were acquired domestically.The outbreak does not seem to be affecting the age group under 20 years. We speculate that most of the MSM found with both syphilis and HIV were already HIV positive when they acquired syphilis infection. Euro Surveill 2004; 9(12):25-27 Published online Dec 2004 Key words : Syphilis, HIV, MSM, Denmark Introduction The annual incidence of acquired syphilis in Denmark dropped to a very low level in the early 1990s. A similar decline was observed in other Western countries and was believed to be at least partly dueto HIV protection campaigns resulting in changes in sexual behaviour, with increased condom use as an important factor [1, 2]. Since thelate 1990s, syphilis rates have gone up in many Western countries. InDenmark this trend has been apparent only during the past few years. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the recent rise in syphilis cases in Denmark. Methods In Denmark syphilis is a mandatory notifiable disease with universal reporting from all clinics and physicians. The case definition is the Latin term syphilis acquisita recens (recently acquired syphilis), including primary, secondary, and early latent (duration less than two years)syphilis (from Official Statement of the Danish Ministry of the Interiorand Health, April 2000). Individual cases are reported to theDepartment of Epidemiology at the Statens Serum Institut (SSI). Thenotifications contain information on gender, ethnicity, sexualorientation, mode and place of transmission, HIV status and otherdemographic data. The form is anonymised by omitting the first fourdigits in the ten digit personal number that every person living inDenmark has assigned to them. This way, the patient remainsanonymous, but the notification forms can be matched to revealduplicate notifications. The Syphilis Laboratory at SSI carries out allsyphilis testing in Denmark. The number of laboratory confirmedcases therefore corresponds to the total number of positive tests,counting both infectious and late cases. The laboratory tests are done on specimens labelled with the full te n digit personal number, excluding the possibility of duplicates. There is no direct link from the laboratorytests to the notifications received by the Department of Epidemiology. * Department of Epidemiology, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, DenmarkThere was no significant difference in the proportion of cases acquired in Denmark in the two periods. During the outbreak, 70% of the cases were acquired domestically, compared with 65% of thecases in the earlier period. The age distribution of the notified cases did not change significantly between the two periods [TABLE 3]. Discussion During the late 1990s, increasing rates of syphilis and other STIs were reported in many Western countries [1, 4-5]. During this time there was a rise in gonorrhoea among MSM in Denmark [6], butsyphilis notifications remained at a very low level until 2003.The background for the rise in STIs is probably complex and can notbe explained by any single factor [7]. In Denmark the annual incidence of notified HIV cases has been remarkably stable, with a mean of 280 cases reported per year for more than 10 years. There has, however, been a slight rise in the proportion of notified HIV cases in MSM, starting in 2003 and continuing in 2004. It is too early to say if this is the start of a true upward trend or just a fluctuation on the otherwise stable HIV notification curve. Doctors from venereal clinics and infectious disease clinics in Denmark report seeing anal chancres as well as penile and oral chancres, indicating both unprotected oral and anal sex as trans- mission routes for syphilis. In the gay community in Denmark, 'safe sex' is primarily understood as 'safe from contracting HIV infection' , and the safe sex advice offered on the internet homepage of STOP AIDS, the Danishgay mens organisation for HIV information, is: 'always use condoms for anal sex and don't get semen in your mouth'The number of notifications for each year is generally lower than that of the laboratory confirmed cases. Each year the laboratory confirmedcases and the anonymously notified cases are reported in EPI-NEWS [3]. For this paper, the syphilis situation in Denmark has been assessed using data from the laboratory confirmed cases and the anonymouslynotified cases from 1 January 1994 to 15 September 2004 For statistical analyses Stata version 8 was used. Proportions were compared with chi square test. Results During the years 1994 to 2001, both notified cases and laboratory confirmed cases were stable at low rates with an average of 50 laboratory confirmed cases and 15 anonymous notifications filed each year. In 2002 there was a slight, non-significant rise in the number of both laboratory notifications and anonymous notifications followed bya sharp increase in 2003 marking the onset of an outbreak [TABLE1].From 1994 to 2002 42 % of the laboratory confirmed cases were notified. In 2003 and 3004 85% of the laboratory confirmed cases were notified. In 2003 the department of epidemiology at SSI received 83 anonymous notifications, and 88 notifications had been received by 15 September 2004. Extrapolating this number yields an estimate of124 notifications for all of 2004. During the outbreak (2003 and 2004), 78% of the notified cases were in MSM, whereas only 33% of the cases notified from 1994 to 2002 were MSM (p< 0.001) [FIGURE]. During the outbreak, 37%of the MSM with notified cases were known to be HIV positive,while this was the case for 33% of the MSM notified from 1994 to2002. This difference was not significant [TABLE 2]. In 2003 - 2004, 75% of the cases were residents of the greater Copenhagen area;this proportion was only 58% in the earlier period (p=0.001) 26 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12TABLE 1 Laboratory confirmed and notified cases, Denmark, 1994 - 2004 * 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1 999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Laboratory notification 25 19 41 59 44 34 54 51 63 108 136 Anonymous notification 10 15 18 17 12 12 13 23 34 83 124 * 2004 extrapolated from 15 September 2004 20406080100120140 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004* YearNumber of cases MSM Men hetero/ unknownWomen hetero/unknown TotalFIGURE Anonymously notified cases by risk group and gender, Denmark, 1994-2004* * 2004 is extrapolated from 15 SeptemberTABLE 2 HIV status of notified cases, MSM and all others, Denmark, 15 September 1994- 2004 * 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1 999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 MSM 1 2 1 3 3 1 3 13 24 67 99 HIV positive 0 1 0 1 1 1 3 5 5 27 31 % HIV positive 91 31 71 4 9 1 1 10 10 10 16 31 HIV positive 0 0 00 1 0 2 301 % HIV extrapolated from 15 September 2004 TABLE 3 Age groups 1994 to 2002 and 2003 to 2004 * * 2004 extrapolated from September 15 20041994 - 2002 2003 - 2004 Under 2 0 years 6 4% 3 1% 20 to 39 ye ars 98 64% 137 56% Over 40 years 49 32% 103 42% All 153 1 00% 243 100% Age gr oups(http://www.stopaids.dk/).Oral transmission of syphilis is very likely in this setting [8].Unprotected oral sex poses a comparatively low risk of HIV transmission [9], and a large number of dual transmission of syphilis and HIV via unprotected oral sex appears unlikely. More likely,syphilis is transmitted orally on its own, or anally - alone or together with HIV [8]. It is not known how often co-infection with syphilis and HIV occurs and how often syphilis is contracted by MSM who are alreadyHIV positive.Since 1994, about a third of the MSM notified with syphilis are known to be HIV positive. This proportion has not increased significantly during the outbreak. The HIV prevalence in the DanishMSM population is assumed to be around 5% [10]. The large proportion of HIV positive MSM in notified syphilis cases in Denmark gives rise to the speculation that some of these maybelong to a subgroup of HIV positive gay men who engage in unprotected anal sex with each other. An indication that this scenariocould be part of the explanation of the rise in syphilis incidence is backed by findings in California in the United States, where there wasno increase in the number of new HIV infections among MSM atpublic HIV-testing sites in San Francisco and Los Angeles during1999-2002, a period when syphilis cases among MSM increased substantially in both cities [11]. So far, the outbreak of syphilis in Denmark is almost exclusively in MSM. In an outbreak in Canada, it was shown that MSM used the internet and bars or bathhouses to initiate sexual contact, whereasheterosexually acquired infectio ns were largely in sex workers and their clients [12]. Sex workers in Denmark generally insist on condom use, and as a result, the prevalence of STIs in this group is low [13]. There is no doubt that there is a strong interrelationship between HIV , syphilis and other STIs [14]. An important questionis whether the current syphilis outbreak in Denmark is facilitatingHIV transmission, or whether syphilis is contained mostly to MSMwho are HIV positive.In an attempt to answer this question and to provide the National Board of Health with information to use in future prevention strategies, the Department of Epidemiology at SSI has engaged in aworking group together with infectious disease specialists, labora- tory clinicians and MSM representatives to plan questionnaire- based investigations. The group is communicating with their Swedishand Norwegian counterparts to try to develop core questions thatcan be a common basis in the Scandinavian questionnaires. In thisway, future comparison of results as well as facilitated co-work is madepossible.At the department of infectious diseases in Copenhagen University Hospital, a screening program of all HIV positive persons attend- ing the clinic was initiated in the spring of 2003. So far the screen-ing has revealed 20 syphilis cases out of 1000 tests [15].In collaboration with the Copenhagen health authorities and the Copenhagen sexual health clinic, STOP AIDS has carried out a campaign, 'Time for a check-up' , where gay men attending a saunaclub during the summer of 2004 were offered a syphilis test with subsequent follow up at a sexual health clinic. Four out of the 93 menwho took the test were positive for syphilis (http://www.stopaids.dk/).Hopefully the planned investigations will yield information that can contribute to a better basis for prevention strategies. The findings in this report are subject to the limitations inherent in the Danish national surveillance system. The proportionof laboratory confirmed syphilis cases that are notified has risenfrom 42% before the outbreak to 85% during the outbreak. Since the reported cases are not linked to the laboratory confirmed ones, we do not know if for instance the proportion of notified cases is morecomplete from the venereal clinics than from the general practitioners. If this was the case, and the populations of syphilis casesfrom the two sites differ in terms of demography, the results couldbe skewed. References 1.Fenton KA, Lowndes CM.

Molecular subtyping showed that most DutchPVL-MRSA genotypes corresponded to well-documented global epidemic types. The most PVL-MRSA genotypes with ST8 increased th e Netherlands from 1% in 2002 to 17% in 2003. It is emphasised that PVL-MRSA might not only emerge in the community, but also in th e hospital environment. Euro Surveill 2004; 9(11):28-29 Published online Nov 2004 Key words : PVL-MRSA, community-acquired, the Netherlands The worldwide emergence of hypervirulent MRSA strains carrying the loci for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is not limited to the community, but may also be emerging in the hospital environment. Since 1989, the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) serves as the national reference center for thesurveillance of MRSA in Dutch hospitals [1]. In 2003, we reported thefirst detection of PVL-MRSA in the Netherlands [2]. Since then, allhospital MRSA isolates (1 per patient) from the national surveillanceprogramme are routinely tested by PCR for the presence of the PVLloci. In the period 2000-2002, approximately 10% of all Dutch hospitalMRSA isolates carried the PVL loci, and molecular subtyping bymultilocus typing (MLST) predominant sequence type: [2]. This article summarises the characteristics of PVL- MRSA in the Netherlands in the year 2003. In 2003, the PVL loci were detected in 8% (123/1601) of the MRSA isolates sent to the RIVM by Dutch hospitals. The national programmeis solely based on surveillance of MRSA, so the proportion of PVL-positive methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) remains unclear, butdeserves attention in the future. Approximately 75% of the PVL-MRSA isolates were obtained from abscesses, furuncles, wounds orblood, the remainder from nose or throat; in non-PVL MRSA isolatesthe reverse ratio was observed. The male:female ratio was 1:1 andthe mean age was 37 years (range 1-88 years). The PVL-MRSA isolateswere obtained from clinics (40%), outpatient clinics (35%), and patients visiting general practitioners (25%). Fifty isolates belonged to epidemic clusters and 73 were sporadic isolates. These 123 isolates belonged to 49 different PFGE types (Dicecut-off 95%, used for local epidemiology). There were 13 outbreakswith PVL-MRSA in the Netherlands in 2003, varying from 2-10 cases per outbreak.One representative of each of the 49 PFGE types was subjected to MLST, resulting in 11 different STs. The 5 most common STs (foundamong 78% (38/49) and ST80 (common'European' type) [3]. In the period 2000-2002, the predominant PVL-MRSA genotype was ST80 [2]. This was the case in 2003: 20% (10/49) of all PVL-MRSA isolates was assigned ST80. This PVL-MRSA genotype ispredominant in European countries ST8, in 2002. PVL-positive S. aureus isolates with this genotype have recently been observed in outbreaks among prisonersand gay men in the United States. [6,7]. Approximately 65% of the PVL-MRSA isolates in 2003 were assigned staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec(SCC mec) type IV [8], followed by SCC mectype III (20%) and type I (15%). Recent data have indicated the presence of SCC mectype IV in community-acquired MRSA [9,10]. Since 40% of the Dutch isolates were obtained from clinics, PVL-MRSA isolates are also present, and presumably spreading, in thehospital environment. The presence of type IV SCCmec MRSA isolatesin European hospitals has been reported before [11]. In general, it isassumed that type IV SCCmec can be transferred relatively easily andis present in a wide range of S. aureus backgrounds [12,13]. Becauseof the low ( 1%) MRSA prevalence in the Netherlands, we are able to study virtually all hospital-acquired MRSA found in the nationalsurveillance programme, which provides an accurate representation ofthe actual MRSA situation in our country. The data presented hereseem to confirm the hypothesis that PVL-MRSA might also be orbecome a hospital-associated public health threat. Neeling AJ.

Here we present characterisation of the first CA-MRSA isolated in Latvia. A PVL-positive ST30-MRSA-IV strain was isolated from a nasal swab and the cent ral venous catheter of a patient with fever and multiple organ failure. The PFGE pattern of this strain was identical to pattern SE00-3 of MRSA isolated in Sweden from 29 patients during 2000-2003. This strain is related to the South Pacific area, and its appearance in Sweden and Latvia demonstrates its global spread. Euro Surveill 2004; 9(11):29-30 Published online Nov 2004 Key words : community acquired, MRSA Introduction Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has recently been reported as an established cause of community acquired (CA)infections [1,2]. The majority of strains have been isolated frompatients with deep skin infections and necrotising pneumonia [3,4,7].CA-MRSA are usually described as (i) being susceptible to majorityof antimicrobials and resistant only to low levels of \u00df-lactamantibiotics, (ii) having a different chromosomal background comparedto hospital-acquired isolates, (iii) carrying SCCmec type IV cassette, and (iv) producing the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) [5,6]. Methods MRSA isolates (n=156) from 142 patients were collected in five Latvian hospitals in Riga and Liepaja from April 2003 to February 2004.Antimicrobial susceptibility testing on these strains was performed according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards(NCCLS) standards by the disc-diffusion method and the presenceof the mecA gene was verified by PCR [7]. Presence of PVL genes(lukS-lukF) and SCCmec type were tested by PCR as described earlier[8,9] in all strains. PVL-positive MRSA (MLRF) [10]. addition, S-5408 strain typed by PFGE [11] and multilocussequence typing (MLST) [12]. Information about the clinical featuresof the disease in the patient was obtained retrospectively. Results Screening of 156 MRSA strains revealed two isolates harbouring genes required for the synthesis of PVL. These two isolates, S-5408 andS-5690, were cultured from catheter and nasal swab, respectively, ofthe same patient. This patient, a forty six year old male with no previous clinical predisposition (immunosuppression, chronic illness, previous hospitaladmission), had a traumatic injury of the upper limb during construction works. Three days later he developed fatigue, swelling of the limb and fever. On the next day he was admitted to the ICU withbullous eruptions around the lips, necrotising pneumonia with pleuriticeffusion, hypotension and renal failure. He reported some possible in-halation of industrial disinfectant and poisoning was suspected. ElevatedWBC count and CRP levels were recorded at the time of admission.Edematous swelling of the limbs persisted during the whole treatmentperiod within the hospital. Blood cultures were not taken but treatment with ciprofloxacin was initiated on admission. The patient gradually improved in ICU and was transferred to the nephrology unit where cultures from the tip of the central venous catheter and nasal swabwere taken as a routine MRSA screening procedure. MRSA was isolated from both cultures and treatment was changed to vancomycin.The patient was discharged from hospital in a stable condition. S-5408 and S-5690 were resistant only to oxacillin and susceptible to all other antibiotics tested (erythromycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fusidic acid, kanamycin, vancomycin and rifampicin). It should be noted that both isolates showed low levelresistance to oxacillin (MIC = 2 mg/L). In addition to the lukS-lukF genes encoding the PVL these strains carried SCCmec of type IV .Molecular analysis showed that MLRF pattern was identical in both strains but markedly different from the pattern of other MRSA isolated at the same time. The PFGE pattern of S-5408 was identicalto pattern SE00-3 of MRSA isolated in Sweden from 29 patients 1. P . Stradins Clinical University Hospital, Riga, Latvia 2. Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, Solna, Sweden EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 / .eurosurveillance.org 2930 EUROSURVEILLANCE [13] [FIGURE]. The allelic profile (2-2-2-2-6-3- 2) of two Swedish isolates typed so far and of Latvian strain S-5408defined them as ST30 ( http://www.mlst.net ). This was in agreement with our analysis of the PFGE pattern (related to the pattern of strain UK EMRSA-16). Discussion A PVL-positive ST30-MRSA-IV was isolated from a nasal swab andthe central venous catheter of a patient with fever and multiple organfailure three days after admission into ICU. This is the first MRSA withfeatures of a community acquired strain to be isolated in Latvia.Only nasal swab and central venous catheter cultures were available.Therefore causal relationship between the clinical symptoms and isolated bacteria has not been proven. Due to the clinical presentationthe patient was suspected to have some kind of industrial poisoningand blood cultures were not taken. Retrospective analysis of the patient's clinical history and improvement on treatment withciprofloxacin made S. aureus sepsis the most likely explanation.Colonisation of the patient by this particular MRSA strain during his brief stay in ICU seemed unlikely because the PFGE and MLRF patterns of other strains isolated from ICU patients at this time were different.The PVL -positive CA-MRSA strain was isolated soon after the firsthospital acquired MRSA strains were detected in early 2003 in Latvia.Although no country-wide surveillance existed, several hospitals hadbeen actively testing for MRSA in previous years, with no MRSA isolate reported. This was a rather different scenario compared withwhat has been observed in other European countries, where hospital acquired strains appeared much earlier. There is no clear explanationas to why MRSA has emerged in Latvian hospitals so late. Most likely,epidemic strains were not imported from abroad earlier because transfer of hospitalised patients between countries was uncommon. In addition, the use of third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones increased significantly only after 2001, when cheapergeneric drugs became available on the market. The use of these broad-spectrum antibiotics could have facilitated the spread of MRSAstrains as was suggested by other investigators [14,15].Multilocus sequence typing attributed S-5408 and Swedish isolates with the same PFGE pattern to ST30. This is in agreement with ourinterpretation of the PFGE pattern as being related to that of strain UK EMRSA-16 [10,13]. Even though in the MLST database EMRSA-16isolates are of a different sequence type, ST36, they belong to the sameclonal cluster, CC30, as ST30 strains. In Europe many CA-MRSA are ofST80 [6,14] while ST30 strains are believed to be related to the SouthPacific area [6]. The epidemiology of the Swedish cases is under investigation and preliminary information links at least some of themto this area. The Latvian patient had not travelled abroad but epidemiological investigation of his household contacts was not performed.In conclusion, the PVL-positive ST30-MRSA-IV strain in Latvia is an important finding which strengthens the hypothesis of globalspread of this pathogen.

Enteritidis) are largely equally virulent, the importance of certain foods as sources of infection for human salmonellosis can be deduced from differences in the distribution of phage types in human and non-human samples. In 2002, S. Enteritidisphage type 29 (PT29) was first isolated from non-human test samples in Austria. S. Enteritidis PT29 accounted for 44 (27 .7%) of 159 S. Enteritidis strains, derived from veterinary samples ofchicken or chicken habitations (e.g. meat, giblets, swabs from the coop and excrement). At the food retail level (chicken meat, chicken liver), five (13.1%) of 38 S. Enteritidis isolates were PT29. The proportion of S. Enteritidis PT29 in human samples wasmuch lower. Only 0.4% (30 human primary isolates) of all S. Enteritidis isolates in the year 2002, and 0.33% (23 human primary isol ates) of all human S. Enteritidis strains in 2003 were PT29. In our opinion, the discrepancy between the high prevalence of S. Enteritidis PT29 in broilers and chicken meat and the lo w number of PT29 cases in humans indicates that chicken meat of Austrian origin is currently only a minor source of human S. Enteritidis infections. Euro Surveill 2004; 9(10):31-34 Published online Oct 2004 Key words : Salmonella Enteritidis PT29, human salmonella, Austria Introduction In 1989 and 1990, human infections with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ser. Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) increased markedly inAustria. A similar trend was observed in many European countries [1]. After a peak in 1992, the incidence of salmonella illness decreased. Since 2000, the numbers of infections have remained at a high level. In 2003, for example, there were 8271 laboratory confirmed (cultured) human salmonella infections. Of these, 7252 (87%) were serotype S. Enteritidis. cooked egg products and chicken meat are generally considered to be the main sources of human infection by S. Enteritidis, but whichof these two is the main source had not previously been determinedin Austria. Due to different eating habits around Europe anddifferences in the contamination rates of various foods, knowledgeobtained from other countries cannot necessarily be applied toAustria. We hope that the following analysis of an outbreak of S. Enteritidis PT29 in Austria from 2000 to 2003 can assist in clarifyingthe relevance - in our opinion, very low - of chicken meat as a vehiclefor human S. Enteritidis infections. Materials and Methods The national reference centre for Salmonella [Nationale Referenzentrale (Austrian Agency for Healthand Food Safety) receives the majority of all human and non-humansalmonella strains isolated in Austria. The non-human bacterialstrains are isolated from environmental samples, medical veterinarysamples or food. The actual number of samples tested is not knownand the representativeness of the isolates for all food andenvironmental contamination is uncertain. However, due to thewidespread implementation of veterinary control programs in broiler chickens and egg production in Austria, and due to food control programs, which rely mainly on random sampling, the isolates derivedfrom chicken are representative for the contamination of chicken. Thesalmonella isolates from the medical sector come mainly from stoolsamples of patients with diarrhoea. In addition to the strain, basicinformation such as date of sample, nature of sample, name, age andaddress of patient are available. Further information, such as travelhistory, is mostly incomplete and rarely obtained or transmitted. Allsalmonella isolates received undergo serotyping (Kauffmann-Whitemethod). All S. Enteritidis isolates are phage typed [2]. Comprehensivephage typing of S.Enteritidis started in Austria in 1991. We compared the proportions of S. Enteritidis PT29 among S.Enteritidis isolates of human (years 2002 and 2003), veterinarian and food origin (year 2002). Strains designated as poultry where thespecies was not stated were excluded from the analysis. A furthersubgroup of non-human strains, S. Enteritidis isolates from chickenas food from the year 2002, were evaluated. These isolates came fromlaboratories that specialise in analysing foodstuffs. From a total of 172 isolates, 103 isolates of S. Enteritidis PT29 (56 human and 47 non-human isolates) were available for further subtyping by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using the XbaIrestriction enzyme. Seventy strains were lost due to storage problems. The protocol was that specified by the European Salm-gene project [3] All 24 patients infected with S. Enteritidis PT29 in 2003 were sent a questionnaire (as routinely used by the national reference centre forSalmonella in Austria), and 50% were returned (12/24). The resultsof the same questionnaire, sent to 598 patients with non-PT29 S. Enteritidis infection for other epidemiological purposes, were usedas a control. The return rate in the control group was 67.1% (401/598). Results The temporal distribution of the isolations of Enteritidis PT29 of human (n=86) and non-human (n=86) origindocumented in Austria from 1999 to 2003 is shown in Figure 1. EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 PT29 strains could not be assigned to a specific group (food or chicken) for the analysis, as the isolate origin was documented only as 'poultry' , without specifying theorigin. In general, non-human isolates originated from broiler chickenproduction. No isolate was obviously related to egg production.The distribution of other phage types differs strongly from the distribution of S. Enteritidis PT29 in human and chicken. In Table 1,the relative frequency of the most common phage types of S. Enteritidisin humans and chickens are compared for 2002. Fifty six of the 86 human S. Enteritidis PT29 isolates and 47 of the 86 non-human S. PT29 isolates were subtyped usingPFGE. These S. showed 3 distinct bandpatterns (dubbed E1, E2, and E3, FIGURE 3). 32 EUROSURVEILLANCE VOL.9 Issue 10-12 Surveillance report Human S. Enteritidis PT29 isolates On 27 August 2000, a human stool isolate of S.Enteritidis was typed as PT29 for the first time in Austria. In the same year, 9 human primaryisolates were identified as S. Enteritidis PT29. At least 4 patients becameill during or within 7 days after a holiday in Croatia; no further informationwas available on these travel-associated cases. There were 23 human S.Enteritidis PT29 strains in 2001. In 2002, 30 human primary isolatesfrom S. Enteritidis PT29 were detected in Austria. In the same year, 7459S. Enteritidis primary isolates from human sources were registered. Theproportion of S. Enteritidis PT29 was only 0.4% of the total number ofhuman S. Enteritidis isolates. For 2003, the ratio was 24 S.Enteritidis PT29 strains out of 7252 S.Enteritidis PT29 isolates were first identified in Austria in April 2002. That year, 86 non-human S. Enteritidis PT29 strains were isolated. S. Enteritidis PT29 has not been found insamples of non-human origin since January 2003. Of the 86 isolates in 2002, 44 came from veterinary samples of chickens or chicken habitations (37 non-human S. Enteritidis PT29 strains lacked detailed information on origin; see below). In 2002, 159S. Enteritidis isolates (all phage types) were isolated from veterinarysamples from chickens: 27.7% of these (confidence interval (CI) 21%to 35%) from chickens or their habitations were PT29. Five of the 86 non-human S. Enteritidis PT29 isolates were from food samples.These were labelled as chicken, chicken breast, chicken liver, chickenresidue, and young broilers. The five food samples were obtained at different times. T esting of the samples took place in 3 laboratories in2 federal states. In 2002, 38 S. Enteritidis isolates (all phage types)were isolated from foods: 13.1% of these (CI 4.4% to 28%) were PT29. Figure 2 presents a comparison of S. Enteritidis PT29 isolateswith the total number of S. Enteritidis isolates from food samples.FIGURE 1 Total number of S.Enteritidis PT 29 isolates of human and non-human origin, Austria, 1999-2003 0510152025Number of isolateshuman non-human 1999 2000 2001 Year2002 2003 FIGURE 2 Comparison of S.Enteritidis PT29 isolates to a total number of S.Enteritidis isolates from food samples and veterinary samples in 2002, and human isolates in 2002 and 2003 24 other PTs Percentage of S.

While 5 of 12 (41.7%) S.Enteritidis PT29 patients reported consumption of chicken meat within 24 hours before onset of illness, 35 of 401 (8.7%) patients with non S. Enteritidis PT29 infec- tions reported consumption of chicken meat. This corresponds to anodds ratio of 7.4 (95%, CI 2.3 - 24.8). Discussion In contrast to other phage types S.Enteritidis PT29 was found exclusively in the meat production line of the poultry industry. This restriction makes it possible to estimate the relevance of chicken meat as source of human infections. In our opinion, the discrepancy betweenthe high occurrence rate of S. Enteritidis PT29 in broilers and chickenmeat in Austria in 2002 and the low number of PT29 cases in humansmay indicate that chicken meat of Austrian origin is a source of onlyminor importance for all human S.Enteritidis infections at the present time. Case-control studies are frequently used to identify risk factors for infectious diseases. Many tests prove the consumption of inade-quately heated egg products as the currently most important risk factor for causing human infections of S. Enteritidis [4-7]. Resultsconcerning the influence of chicken meat are divided. Some studies [6,7] find a clear association between consuming chicken and illness,while other studies cannot prove any connection [5,6]. For method-ological reasons, case-control studies can explain only some of the infections [8]. Salmonella can also be transferred to other foodstuffs,causing secondary contamination (e.g. transfer of pathogens fromchicken meat to spices, lettuce, etc.). Infections that no longer seem to be connected to consumption of chicken meat can therefore occur. The quantitative relevance of such infection is not known [9]. Phage typing of S.Enteritidis was developed to clarify epidemio- logical relationships after the worldwide increase in infections [2].While S. Enteritidis PT4 is predominant in western Europe, PT8 and PT13a are mainly seen in North America [1]. Epidemiological studies show that large outbreaks can also be caused by rare phage typesas long as transfer occurs through suitable vectors, e.g. eggs [10,11]. Most phage types of S. Enteritidis differ very little in their ability to cause human infection. Assuming the largely identical virulence of various phage types, conclusions can be drawn about the importanceof chicken meat as a source of infection for human salmonellosis,based on the distribution of S. Enteritidis in human versus non-human sample material. The outbreak of S. Enteritidis PT29 (in humans and in chickens) which we are presenting here lasted for 4 years in Austria. In 2000 and 2001 only human infections occurred.Epidemiological investigation (data not shown) indicated that most of these infections were acquired in Croatia. Since April 2002 S.Enteritidis PT29 has also been isolated from chicken habitations inAustria. A large breeding business had bought breeding eggs from Croatia. S. Enteritidis PT29 established itself in several breeding businesses for broiler chickens over the following months (Dr Pless,Styrian veterinary administration, personal communication). Little information is available about the phage type distribution of S.Enteritidis in humans and non-humans in different European coun-tries. S. Enteritidis PT29 is not listed in published tables, indicating that EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 33S. Enteritidis PT29 is a rare type of S. Enteritidis in Europe [12,13]. PFGE enabled the clonal origin of these chicken isolates to be determined. With only one exception (E3), all 47 non-human isolates tested were classified as PFGE type E2. Among the humanisolates, type E3 was predominant in the first 2 years - 2000 and 2001;12 of the 19 isolates (63.2%) tested belonged to this PFGE type. ThePFGE type E2, dominant in Austrian chicken (veterinary and food samples), was found as an infective agent with humans as of 2001and became dominant among human isolates only as of 2002 (25 ofthe human strains tested in 2002 and 2003, i.e. 69.4%). In our opinion, two separate events are behind the S. Enteritidis PT29 outbreak. In 2000 and 2001 there were mainly travel-associatedinfections (Croatia). Contamination of domestic chicken meat withS. Enteritidis PT29 first appeared in 2002. More than 10% of all S. Enteritidis contamination from domestically slaughtered poultry in2002 was caused by PT29. This assumption is supported by the numberof S. Enteritidis PT29 in food at retail level (13% of all S. Enteritidisfound in edible chicken). The S. Enteritidis PT29 positive food sampleswere widely distributed in time and place. The rate of S. Enteritidis PT29 in the veterinary medical samples and in the food samples was,however, much higher than the remarkably small proportion of S.Enteritidis PT29 isolates from human samples. Only 0.40% of thehuman S. Enteritidis strains from 2002 and 0.33% of the S. Enteritidis strains of 2003 were typed as PT29. Chicken meat is often frozen and stored for a long time, which means that human isolates of 2003 must also be taken into consider-ation to determine the relevance of chicken meat as source of infectionfor human illness. All the patients with human cases of S. EnteritidisPT29 in 2003 were approached and asked to complete a question-naire. From the completed questionnaires, we deduced that S. Enteritidis PT29 was predominantly transmitted to humans by theconsumption of chicken meat, although the possibility of other sources cannot be dismissed. Nevertheless, if other routes of infections had beenof importance, our conclusions would still be valid. From the data presented here, we conclude that Austrian chicken meat is probably only of minor importance as a source of human S. Enteritidis infections, regardless of phage type. This applies tochicken meat as direct source of infection as well as infections from secondary contamination. The incidence of human S. Enteritidis infections remains high in Austria. The main focus of preventivemeasures should be directed at reducing the danger of infection causedby the consumption of eggs [4-7]. The efforts of the European Commission, which requires chicken carcasses to be free of salmonella by 2010, are nonetheless welcome [14]. References 1.Rodrigue DC, Tauxe RV, Rowe B.

(http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040219.asp ) In addition to AIDS surveillance, data on HIV infection are necessary to better follow the dynamics of the epidemic. We report the first results of France's mandatory anonymous HIV notification syst em, which is linked to a virological surveillance ofrecent HIV infections and of circulating HIV types, groups and subtypes. HIV notifications are initiated by microbiologists who createan anonymous code of patient's identity. Clinicians complete the notifica tion form with epidemiolog ical and clinical data. Notifications are sent to the local health authorities and passedto the Institut de Veille Sanitaire (InVS). Laboratories voluntarily send sera from newly diagnosed HIV infected persons on dried blood spots to the national HIV reference laboratory where an immunoassay for recent infection (<6 months) and a serotyping assay for the determination ofgroup and subtype are done. The virological results are thenmerged at the InVS with the information from the mandatory reporting. Of the first 1301 new HIV diagnoses reported in 2003, 43% werein women, and overall, 53% were in heterosexuals, of whom 47% were ofsub-Saharan African origin. MSM accounted for 36% of male notifications. A dried blood spot was available for 64% of new HIV diagnoses.Evidence of recent infection was found for 38%, ranging from22% in IDUs to 58% in MSM. Twenty-six per cent of infections in sub-Saharan migrants were recent infections. HIV-1 accounted for98% of all notifications: 48% of these were non-B subtypes. The first results of the HIV notification system indicate that heterosexual transmission is the predominant mode of trans-mission and that persons origin ating from sub-Saharan Africa are particularly affected. Over half of infections shown to be recently acquired were in MSM; this may indicate an increased HIV incidence in this population. Euro Surveill 2004; 9(10):34-37 Published online Oct 2004 Key words : HIV, surveillance, France Introduction The mandatory reporting system for AIDS has existed in France since 1986. The creation of a surveillance system for HIV infectionhas for many years been a public health objective in order to betterfollow the dynamics of the epidemic. The Institut de Veille Sanitaire(InVS) worked at length with representatives of civil society, publichealth professionals, patients' associations, and the French dataprotection authority to design a comprehensive surveillance systemthat would be respectful of patients' rights. This system wasimplemented in March 2003, and, in common with many otherEuropean countries, France now has its own mandatory reporting system for HIV [1,2]. Together with the new mandatory reporting system for HIV , virological surveillance of 'recent' HIV infections and of circulating subtypes was created in order to contribute to estimating HIVincidence. This article aims to present the preliminary results (data from March to September 2003) of these new surveillance systems [3]. Methods Mandatory reporting of HIV Any HIV positive serology confirmed for the first time by a microbiological laboratory must be notified, with the exception ofdiagnoses made at anonymous and voluntary counselling/testingsites. There are around 4500 microbiological laboratories in France. HIV mandatory notifications are initiated by microbiologists who use software provided by the InVS to create a unique and irreversibleanonymous code for each person, using date of birth, first name,initial of last name, and sex [FIGURE 1]. Some epidemiological andclinical details (occupation, nationality, reason for testing, priornegative or positive serology, clinical stage, mode of exposure) are thensupplied by clinicians. Notifications are sent to the local health authorities (Directions D\u00e9partementales des Affaires Sanitaires et Sociales, DDASS), andpassed on to InVS where a second anonymous code, alsounique and irreversible, is generated. Those codes allow thedetection of duplicates so that the same person cannot beregistered twice, and also link notifications for HIV , AIDS and deaths. 1. D\u00e9partement des Maladies Infectieuses, Institut de Veille Sanitaire 2. Centre National de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence du VIH, Tours, France Of the 690 people infected through heterosexual transmission, 60% were women, 47% were nationals from a sub-Saharan African country (mainly Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Congo and Democratic Republic of Congo) and 31% were nationals from France [FIGURE 2]. Clinical stage The majority of new diagnoses of HIV infection in 2003 were asymptomatic (53%), 15% were at a non-AIDS symptomatic stage, 12%had AIDS and 8% were early diagnoses at primary infection stage.The clinical stage was not documented for 12% of notifications. The clinical stage at the time of diagnosis of HIV infection varied depending on the mode of transmission. Men who have sex with men(MSM) were more often diagnosed during primary infection (22%)than were heterosexuals (5%), and heterosexuals more often were diagnosed an asymptomatic stage (61%) than were MSM (48%). Virological surveillance The proportion of patients who refused virological surveillance was very low (5%). Consent was not documented in 16% ofnotification forms, however, and the dried blot spot was not carriedout in 15% of cases. Immunoassay for recent HIV infection Results of assays for recent HIV infection were available for 839 patients (64%). The proportion of recent infections among new diagnoses in 2003 was 38.4% [CI 95%: 35.0 - 41.8]. This proportionvaried significantly age, mode of infection and nation-ality [TABLE 2]. The proportion of recent infections was higher in those under 40 years of age, regardless of sex. Over half (58%) of new diagnoses in MSM were recent infections, EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 35Virological surveillance Virological surveillance is conducted to determine the virus type (HIV-1 or HIV-2) among the HIV infection diagnoses, and for the HIV-1 diagnoses, the group, the subtype, and whether or not infectionoccurred recently (\u00a3 6 months), with the help of an immunoassayfor recent infection based on the detection of antibodies towards two antigens (the immunodominant epitope of gp41 (IDE) and V3peptide) assay , developed by the National national de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence du VIH, CNR VIH, T ours,),was validated on a population of HIV-infected patients for whomprobable time of infection was known. Excluding new HIV diagnosesin patients who present with AIDS, the assay sensitivity was estimatedto be 87% and specificity 98% on dried blood spots (F Barin, personal communication). All the virological tests were performed by the National HIV Reference Laboratory from a dried blood spot collected by microbiologists from the stored blood sample that allowed theoriginal diagnosis of HIV infection. Virological results are then sentto InVS where they are linked to the information from the mandatory report ing. Patient consent to virological surveillance is obtained by the reporting clinician. For this article, complete HIV notification forms received at the InVS between March and 30 September 2003 have been analysed (microbiologist and clinician information) for new diagnoses only(positive serology diagnosed and notified in 2003, without anymention of prior positive serology, unless the prior positive test firstoccurred within the 12 preceding months). Results Mandatory notification of HIV Between March and 30 September 2003, 1301 new diagnoses of HIV infection were reported to the InVS. Sex and age The proportion of women was 43%. The mean age at the time of the diagnosis of HIV infection was 37 years for all cases. It was lowerin women than in men (33.6 years versus 39.4 years; p<10 -4). Mode of infection and nationality Over half of the new diagnoses of HIV infection in 2003 concerned individuals who were infected by heterosexual transmission, and21% (27% if the unknown group is excluded) by homosexualtransmission. Transmission by injecting drug use represents only 3% (4% if the unknown group is excluded) of the new diagnoses[TABLE 1].FIGURE 2 Distribution of persons infected through heterosexual inter- course according to sex and nationality (n=690), France, 30 September 2003 32% 15% 13% 15% 9% 16% Sub-Saharan African women French women Sub-Saharan African men French men Women of other/unknown nationalityMen of other/unknown nationalityFIGURE 1 Notification of HIV infection in France TABLE 1 New diagnoses of HIV infection in 2003 according to the route of transmission and sex, France, 30 September 2003 Mode of infectionWomen n (%)Men n (%)Total* n drug use 7 1.2% 30 4.0% 2.8% Other*, unknown 135 24.4% 170 22.8% 305 23.4% Total 554 100% 74 71 0 0 %1 3 0 1 1 0 0 % * for 8 cases whose route of transmission was other than those mentionn ed aboveSex36 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 Surveillance report as were nearly one third (32%) of those infected through heterosexual intercourse. In injecting drug users (IDUs), the number of patientsrecently infected was lower (4/18). Generally speaking, the proportion of recent infections among sub-Saharan Africans was lower than in French persons (26% versus 50%).Similarly, in sub-Saharan African heterosexuals, the proportion of recent infections was lower than in French heterosexuals (26% versus 44%). In French patients infected through heterosexual transmission, the proportion of recent infections was higher in women than in men(52% versus 35%, p=0.03). SerotypingIt was possible to determine the virus type for 1019 individuals newly diagnosed in 2003, by the National Reference Laboratory and/orby the biologist. The proportion of HIV-2 was 3.1% [2.2-4.4], of which of HIV-1/HIV-2 . Among HIV-1 infections, the group was known for 748 cases. Infections by group O virus represented 0.3% (2/748). Within group M (n=746), it was possible to determine the subtype for only 41 cases.Among cases that were subtyped, 48% The rates of B and non-B subtypes varied significantly according to sex, age, mode of infection and nationality, but not according to whetherthe infection was recent or not. The proportion of non-B subtypes was higher in men than in women (54% versus 45%), and in those under 40 compared to those over 40 (54% versus 36%), and in heterosexuals compared to MSM or IDUs (58% versus 13%). The proportion of non-B infections was 19% in French patients, whereas it reached 82% in sub-Saharan African patients. Discussion Compared with AIDS surveillance as it was performed until the beginning of 2003, the novelty of this HIV surveillance system integrated with the AIDS surveillance system is the involvement ofprivate practitioners and microbiologists (30% of notifications wereinitiated by private microbiologists and 24% were completed by private practitioners) and the use of a double anonymous code allowinga maximal protection of the patients' confidentiality. The experienceof 2003 shows that the system has worked well, despite the high numbers of reporting health professionals involved. Nevertheless, the management of notification forms was complicated, due to the meas-ures implemented to protect confidentiality. A formal review of thesystem is planned for the end of 2004. Considering the progressive increase of the system's activity and the notification delays, the number of new HIV diagnoses reported between March and September 2003 underestimates the real numberof diagnoses during this period. One of the novelties of this surveillance system is the use of a assay for recent HIV infection. The period of time that defines a recent infection (6 months) can appear to be short in a surveillance context, butthis is due to the technical constraints of the assay. Some tests of recent HIVinfection based on a 'sensitive HIV enzyme immunoassay' (such asOrganon T eknica Vironostica) have also been used in other countries, ina sentinel surveillance context in the United States, and for a pilot project in Canada (unpublished data). The global overall percentage ofrecent infections observed in France during the first months of surveillance (38.4%) was higher than present one observed in those twocountries (United States: 19.2% [182/949] and Canada: 25.8% [122/472]). It could be explained by differences in screening practices policy between these countries, but also by methodological differences (time when the as-say was performed, compared with the time of the original diagnosis ofHIV , definition of the new HIV diagnoses) In Europe, the Organon T eknica Vironostica test has been used in the United Kingdom and in Amsterdam in the Netherlands in MSMpatients consulting for a sexually transmitted infection in order toestimate HIV incidence in this population [5,6]. In 2003, heterosexual intercourse represented the main mode of transmission in new diagnoses of HIV infection (53%) and also in AIDS cases (51%). The epidemic in heterosexuals largely affects thesub-Saharan African population, since nearly one in two heterosexual cases originated from this part of the world. The increase of theproportion of sub-Saharan nationals Africans in the epidemic is areflection of the enormous epidemic underway in Africa and of France's historical links with some of the countries in this continent. The United Kingdom and Belgium are experiencing a similar situa-tion: in 2002-2003, over 70% of HIV infections in heterosexuals inthose two countries occurred in people originating from a regionwhere HIV prevalence was high [7]. The proportion of recent infections was lower in the heterosexual population from sub-Saharan Africa than in the French population(26% versus 44%). This could be explained by Africans' poorer accessto testing , both in their country of origin and in France, and therefore a lower probability of being diagnosed during the monthsimmediately following infection. T esting and care of these sub-SaharanAfrican populations, often living in precarious circumstances, must be reinforced [8]. The decrease in the number of AIDS cases in IDUs and the low proportion of IDUs in new HIV diagnoses (3%) in 2003 confirmsthe reduction of HIV transmission in this population. A large proportion of HIV-positive injecting dr ug users was tested early, long before reaching the AIDS stage. The epidemic is stable in men infected through homosexual transmission, and MSM represent an important group among the new diagnoses of HIV infection (21%), and 27% of AIDS cases in 2003.The proportion of recent infections was highest in this group (58%).This could reflect the behaviour relapse observed in recent years in thispopulation [9]. This number must, however, be interpreted carefully asit is highly dependent on screening practices: MSM test for HIV morefrequently than other groups at risk, and so the probability of beingscreened shortly after infection is higher (87% of MSM versus 36% ofall men have been tested for HIV at least once in their lifetime) [9,10].

The proportion of non-B subtypes (45%) higherthan the one observed in previous studies: 33% in or 16%over the period 1996-1998 [13]. Non-B subtypes affect mainly sub-Saharan African patients, and this is consistent with the predominance of those subtypes on the African continent. The highproportion of non-B subtypes (19%) in French HIV infected patients(including those recently infected) suggests that the non-B subtype isalso in circulation in the French population, particularly in heterosexuals. ConclusionThe mandatory notification of HIV and AIDS, together with virological surveillance of recent infections, has greatly improved HIV surveillance in France in 2003. First results suggest that heterosexual transmission is the predominant mode of transmission in France, particularly in the sub-Saharan African population. HIV transmission appeared to be particularly active in the MSM population in 2003. In contrast,infections linked to injecting drug use are less frequent. Non-B subtypes circulate widely in France.

The collection of Neisseria meningitidis strains ke pt in the NRL for Meningococcal Infections in Prague dates from 1970 onwards, and represents more than 3500 strains isolated from invasive disease and their contacts, from heal thy carriers and from respiratory infection. Analysis of these stra ins showed that th e Czech meningococcal popula- tion is different from that seen in western Europe. In 1993, the incidence serogroup C meningococcal disease increased and was associated with the emergence of the hypervirulent com- plex Neisseria meningitidis C, ST-1 1, ET-15/37 , and caused an increase in the in cidence of invasive meningococcal disease which peaked in 1995 (2.2/100 000). A vaccination strategy targeting the part of the population at highest risk of invasive meningococcal disease was adopted in the country. Euro Surveill 2004; 9(11):37-39 Published online Nov 2004 Key words : Invasive meningococcal disease, active surveillance, clonal analysis, vaccination strategy, Czech Republic Introduction Invasive meningococcal disease is still one of the most serious infectious diseases, despite the availability of early antibiotic treatmentand development of modern intensive care for the patients. Routinenotification of invasive meningococcal disease has a long tradition inthe Czech Republic: mortality data on the disease are available from1921 and morbidity data from 1943 [1]. The National ReferenceLaboratory (NRL) for Meningococcal Infections in the NationalInstitute of Public Health (NIPH) in Prague has been dealing with this disease since the 1970s using a multidiscipline approach to the studyof the causative agent and host factors. Thanks to long and detailedmonitoring of the disease and the emerged in 1993 [2]. This hypervirulent complex was responsible for a marked increase in invasive meningococcaldisease in the country: with substantial morbidity and mortality.Facing this situation, the NRL for Meningococcal Infections has implemented an enhanced surveillance of invasive meningococcal * National Reference Laboratory for Meningococcal Infections, National Institute of Public Health, Prague, Czech Republic38 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 Surveillance report in 1995/1996 when the incidence of MenC invasive disease reached its highest values: 10.8 per 100000 in 0-11 month old children, 7.2 per100000 in 1-4 year olds, 2.5 per 100000 in 5-9 year olds, 1.4 per 100000in 10-14 year olds and 5.8 per 100000 in 15-19 year olds. A strategy ofvaccination aimed at the part of the population at highest risk ofinvasive meningococcal disease was adopted and teenagers werevaccinated in the most affected region in 1993 using polysaccharide A+Cvaccine [7]. The incidence of invasive meningococcal disease causedby serogroup C decreased between 1996-1999, but began to increase again from 2000 [FIGURE 3]. This increase in incidence was causedby the same hypervirulent complex C, ST-11. The highest increase in incidence caused by serogroup C was noticed in the 15-19 year old agegroup (2.7 per 100000 in 2003). These cases occurred throughout the country in non-vaccinated adolescents only and for this reason, in May 2004 the NRL for Meningococcal Infections in Prague recommended vaccination with MenC conjugate vaccine targeted at this age group at highest risk. In addition, meningococcal diseasevaccination is offered to the contacts of invasive meningococcal disease,to recruits (since 1995), to patients with underlying diseases and to travellers. Vaccination is also available on request, without any clinical or epidemiological indication. FIGURE 3 Incidence of invasive meningococcal disease caused by serogroup C, Czech Republic, 1993-2003disease, to improve quality of data on case patients, timeliness ofreporting and linkage with microbiological data. In this paper, the results of enhanced surveillance, in cluding clonal analysis of meningococcal strains, which influenced vaccination strategy are presented. Methods Enhanced surveillance is based on guidelines published in the Bulletin of the Czech Ministry of Health in 1993 and is coordinated by the NRL for Meningococcal Infections. The weekly reporting of invasivemeningococcal disease is compulsory. Physicians must complete aquestionnaire for every patient reported, with demographic, clinical andepidemiological data. The questionnaire is sent to the regionalepidemiologist, who collates the data and reports them weekly via theinternet to the main epidemiological database (EPIDAT) kept in theNRL for Analysis of Epidemiological Data in NIPH. Neisseriameningitidis strains isolated from cases of invasive meningococcaldisease in the laboratories of clinical microbiology of the entire countryare sent to the NRL for Meningococcal Infections for confirmationand further investigation. The strains are investigated by classicalmethods and by molecular methods fo r clonal MLST method was developed by this laboratory for the direct testing of clinical specimen which allows more precise surveillance of IMD [4]. Epidemiological and microbiological data are combinedtogether in the one surveillance database kept in the NRL for Meningococcal Infections. Results The collection of Neisseria meningitidis strains kept in the NRL for Meningococcal Infections in Prague dates from 1970 onwards and represents more than 3500 strains isolated from invasive disease (1320 strains) and their contacts (520 strains), from healthy carriers (1390strains) and from respiratory infection (300 strains). Nearly 100% of are serogrouped, 70% are MLEE and 40% investigated by MLST. Detailed analysisof these strains showed that the Czech meningococcal population isdifferent compared with western Europe. A new serotype 22 for serogroupB was discovered by the NRL for Meningococcal Infections in Prague [5]and a hybridoma for monoclonal antibody with a reference strain wereprovided to the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control(Potters Bar, UK). Strains of this serotype are typical for countries ofeastern Europe and belong to the ST-18 complex(http://pubmlst.org/neisseria). The difference between Czechmeningococcal populations, compared with western Europe, wasconfirmed by MLST: some sequence types were found exclusively in the Czech Republic (for example ST-101, ST-292, ST-388) and some exclusively in countries of central and eastern Europe (for example ST-18).Meningococcal strains from invasive meningococcal disease and from carriers were compared by MLST as well. Carrier strains of meningococciare highly diverse and contain multiple genotypes, most of which (125/156,80%) were unrelated to known hyperinvasive lineages [6]. The incidence of invasive meningococcal disease was highest in 1953 (14.8/100 000) [FIGURE]. From the 1970s to the 1990s the diseasewas sporadic in the Czech Republic. A critical emergency situationstarted in 1993, when hypervirulent complex ST-11, ET-15/37 emerged.The incidence of invasive meningococcal and 1995 (2.2/100 000) [FIGURE 1, TABLE]. The most frequentphenotype of this ST-11 complex was C:2a:P1.2,5. The case fatality ratecaused by meningococcal hypervirulent complex C, ST-11 wassubstantially higher compared to the case fatality rate caused by serogroupB [TABLE ] and reached its highest values in teenagers. Long-termsurveillance of invasive meningococcal disease shows that meningococcalserogroup C (MenC) is responsible for changes of total incidence, whilemorbidity due to serogroup B remains stable [FIGURE 2]. by complex C, 0246810121416 notification surveillance YearIncidence per 100 000 19431945 1955 1965 1975 1985 1995FIGURE 1 Incidence of invasive meningococcal disease in the Czech Republic, 1943-2003 01234567 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003total 15-19 y YearIncidence per 100 000FIGURE 2 Incidence of invasive meningococcal disease - total and serogroup specific, average annual incidence rate over 5 year periods, 100 000EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 39Conclusion The incidence of invasive meningococcal disease caused by serogroup C reached its highest values in the Czech Republic in 1995. Only polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine giving short-term protection wasavailable at that time. All cases were in the non-vaccinated. Meningococcal C conjugate vaccine was registered in the Czech Republic in 2001, when the incidence of invasive meningococcal disease causedby serogroup C was four times lower than in 1995. For this reason, no plans for large-scale vaccination such as has been carried out in theUnited Kingdom were adopted. This situation began to change in recent years, when the incidence of invasive meningococcal disease caused by serogroup C, ST-11 increased. Incidence caused by serogroupC, ST-11 had an increasing trend in 15-19 year olds since 2000 and forthis reason, vaccination with meningococcal C conjugate vaccine targeting this age group was recommended by the NRL in May 2004, although the incidence caused by serogroup C was several times lowerthan in countries with recent vaccination campaigns ( http://www.eu- ibis.org/ ). However, serogroup B increased during summer 2004, serogroup C started to decline, and it was decided not to implementsuch a programe.

Eighty nine clusters were detected, 35 (39%) of which would not have been detected without the EWGLINET scheme. One hundred and seven accommodation sites were investigated and 22 sites were published on the EWGLI website. The proportion of cases diagnosed primarily by the urinaryantigen test was 81.2%, and 48 positive cultures were obtained. Thirty eight deaths were reported to the EWGLINET scheme, giving a crude fatality rate of 6%.

Euro Surveill 2004; 9(10):40-43 Published online Oct 2004 Key words : Legionnaire s' disease, travel, Europe Introduction The European Working Group for Legionella Infections (EWGLI) was formed in 1986 to facilitate international collaboration acrossEurope with regards to legionnaires' disease. In 1987, EWGLI established a surveillance scheme for travel-associated legionnaires'disease (EWGLINET) that aims to track all cases of the disease inEuropean residents, and thereby identify clusters of cases associated with particular sites. Upon identification of a cluster site, EWGLINET initiates and monitors immediate control measures and investigationsundertaken at that site, and ensures that international standards areadhered to. The history and current activities of EWGLI are described further on its website ( www.ewgli.org ). This paper provides results and commentary on cases of travel- associated legionnaires' disease reported to EWGLINET with onset in2003. MethodsAll countries that participate in EWGLINET use standard case definitions. A single case is defined as a person who stayed, in thetwo to ten days prior to onset of illness, at a public accommodationsite that has not been associated with any other previous cases oflegionnaires' disease, or a person who stayed at an accommodation sitelinked to other cases of legionnaires' disease but after an interval ofat least two years [1]. A cluster of travel-associated legionnaires' disease is defined as two or more cases who stayed at or visited the same accommodationsite in the two to ten days before onset of illness and whose onset iswithin the same two year period [1].National surveillance schemes detect and follow up each case within the country of residence and then report the case, travel andmicrobiology details to the EWGLINET coordinating centre at theHealth Protection Agency's Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) in London. The details are entered onto a database, and thedatabase is searched to check whether that case should form or becomepart of a cluster, or whether it is a single case. In July 2002, European guidelines were introduced to standardise national responses to cluster alerts by EWGLINET [1-5]. The responseto single cases is via the collaborator in the country of infection, who issues a checklist for minimising risk of legionella infection to anyaccommodation sites involved. Cluster sites require that more detailedinvestigations be carried out, including risk assessments, samplingand control measures. Countries report the progress of suchinvestigations to the coordinating centre in London using a Form A(two-week investigation report) and Form B (six-week investigation report) for each cluster. If these forms are not received within the relevant time period, EWGLINET publishes details of the cluster on its public website ( www.ewgli.org ) to state that the coordinating centre cannot be confident that the accommodation site has adequate controlmeasures in place. This notice is removed once the relevant form(s)have been received, to confirm that measures to minimise the risk oflegionella infection at the site have been taken. ResultsCases and outcomes Thirty six countries participated in EWGLINET in 2003 [FIGURE 1] and reported a total of 632 cases of travel-associated legionnaires'disease to the coordinating centre with onset in 2003 (including onecase reported by the United States, which is outside of EWGLINET).This compares with 676 cases reported in 2002. Cases reported to EWGLINET follow a distinctive age and sex pattern. Each year, approximately three times as many male cases arereported as female cases, and most cases are aged 50 years or over. In 2003, male cases outnumbered female cases by 2.6 to 1, and the peakage group reported was 50-59 years for both sexes. The age range for FIGURE 1 Countries reporting more than 10 cases in 2003 05 0 100 150 200NorwayScotlandDenmarkSpainSwedenOtherGermanyItalyNetherlandsFranceEngland and WalesReporting country Number of reports * Health Protection Agency, CDSC, London, United Kingdommales was 15 to 91 years, and for females, 15-89 years (with one case of unknown age). EWGLINET sees a very seasonal pattern of reporting. There is often a peak in the number of cases with onset over the summermonths, and a drop-off in cases over winter. This is, for the mostpart, because the scheme records only travel-associated cases, and themajority of people choose to take their holidays during the summer.In 2003, cases peaked in July, with a second, smaller peak, in September. The case fatality rate in 2003 was 6% (38 deaths reported), a very slight decrease from previous years. The number of patient recoveriesreported increased from 30% in 2002 (203 cases) to 38% in 2003 (238 recoveries). 192 cases were reported as 'still ill' (a similar number to previous years), whilst the number of cases with unknown outcomesdecreased from 34% in 2002 to 26% (164 cases) in 2003. These are thecase outcomes at time of report to EWGLINET, or final outcomes iffollow-up information is forwarded to EWGLINET at a later date. MicrobiologyThe proportion of cases diagnosed by urinary antigen detection as the main diagnostic method continued to increase (80.5% in 2002 [2],81.2% of cases in 2003). The number of culture proven cases remainedrelatively constant (48), while the number of cases diagnosed by serology declined slightly from 2002 (in 2003, 23 cases were diagnosedby four-fold rise, and 43 cases by single-high titre, compared with 2002's 49 diagnoses by four-fold rise and 31 by single-high titre). The main category of detected organism reported to the coordinating centre was Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (485 cases, 76.7%). The remaining cases 'L. pneumophilaserogroup other cases, 0.5%. Two of these caseswere L. bozemanii, the species of the third was not reported). TravelThe main countries reporting cases of travel-associated legionnaires' disease in their citizens were England and Wales (159 cases), France(120) and the Netherlands (104) [FIGURE 2]. The main countries of infection were Italy (122 cases) and France (118), largely because both of these countries report many cases of thedisease in their citizens who have been travelling within their owncountries (Italy had 64 internal cases, France had 89). The countries visited by the third and fourth highest numbers of cases were Spain(91 cases) and Turkey (64), neither of which reports much internaltravel (Spain reported 9 cases in 2003, Turkey did not report any). If external travel (i.e. foreign travel) only is considered, Spain (82 cases in 2003) and Turkey (64) become the countries with the highestnumber of infections, followed by Italy (58) and France (29). All other countries of infection had fewer external travel cases. The proportion of cases linked to clusters for the main four countries of infection ranged from 26% (France) to 41% (Turkey). For Turkey,this is a big improvement on the 71% of cases linked to clusters in 2002. Italy had 29% linked to clusters in 2003, while Spain had31% [FIGURE 3]. Twenty seven cases visited more than one European country, and eight visited more than one country including one or more non-European countries. An additional 68 cases (10.8%) visited countries outside the EWGLINET scheme. Whilst 494 cases stayed in only one accommodation site during their 2-10 day incubation period, the remaining 138 stayed in more thanone, with one Danish case staying in eight. The average number of sitesper case was 1.42. ClustersEighty nine new clusters were detected in 2003. Clusters were de- fined as two or more cases associated with the same accommodationsite, where the second and subsequent cases had onset in 2003, and thefirst case had onset up to two years previously. These clusters variedin size, and although the majority consisted of only two cases (66clusters), one cluster involved 17 cases. This cluster was located inEngland, and centred on a hotel and leisure centre. In addition to the17 English travel-associated cases, of whom two died, there were threefurther cases of legionnaires' disease and two cases of Pontiac feveridentified in the community (none of whom died), giving a total of22 cases of disease associated with this outbreak. The source wastraced to a spa pool located in the complex. The second largest outbreak detected by EWGLINET in 2003 was located at a hotel in Spain, and was associated with eight Swedishcases of travel-associated legionnaires' disease. No deaths were re-ported to EWGLINET. The first six cases formed a new cluster in theearly half of 2003, sampling for legionella at the hotel was positive,control measures were taken, and a Form B report was submitted. However,subsequent to this, two further cases stayed at the accom- EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 41EWGLI Collaborating countries - 2003 Collaborating Centre Collaborating Country FIGURE 2 Countries visited by more than 5 travel cases in 2003 by type of case 05 0 100 150BelgiumTunisiaUSASri LankaBulgariaNon-Europe >1MaltaGermanyCruiseThailandEurope 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 Surveillance report modation site and became ill, leading to a request from EWGLINET for new investigations and a new Form A and B to be submitted. Thereports showed that samples were again found to be positive, and that further control measures had been carried out. The Spanish authorities reacted promptly to the EWGLINET alerts, and gave detailed updates on the situation at the hotel to the coordinating centre throughout the investigations. At the time of writing, no further cases have been reported with association to this hotel. In contrast to the two clusters detailed above, 35 of the clusters detected in 2003 involved a single case from two or more countries, andso would not ordinarily have been detected by any individual country.Thus 39% of the clusters with onset in 2003 would not have beenidentified without the EWGLINET surveillance scheme. The 2003 clusters occurred in a total of seventeen countries. France had the most (18 clusters), followed by Italy (14), Turkey (12) and Spain(11). Twelve clusters fell in countries outside the EWGLINET scheme(Bahamas, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Mexico, Sri Lankaand Thailand), and three were situated on cruise ships. Five clustersinvolved two or more accommodation sites, of which one spanned twocountries. Most of the clusters had onset in summer, with peaks in July and October, but at least two clusters occurred in every month in2003. Investigations The eighty nine new clusters in 2003 involved a total of 98 sites, one of which was already under inv estigation, and 12 of which were situated in non-EWGLI countries, leaving 85 that required EWG-LINET investigations. In addition, 21 sites that had been associated with clusters in previous years were associated with additional cases ('clusterupdates'), and so required re-investigation. In total, 106 investiga-tions were required by EWGLINET for 2003 clusters and cluster updates. EWGLINET also requested the investigation of a cluster sitein northern Cyprus (a non-EWGLI country). Turkey arranged this andreturned a Form B, giving a total of 107 Form B reports received for the 2003 clusters and cluster updates. Fifty nine 'Form B' reports (55%) stated that samples from the accommodation site had tested positive for L. pneumophila (at con-centrations equal to or greater than 1000 cfu/litre), 46 (43%) reported that samples had not detected any L. pneumophila, and two Form Breports (2%) were unable to give sampling results for reasons accepted by the coordinating centre. The names of fifteen of theTurkish sites and one French site from new clusters or cluster up- dates in 2003 were published on the EWGLINET website for failureto return reports on time, or for failure to implement appropriate control measures on time. Four Turkish cluster sites and one French cluster identified in 2002 but where investigations were due in 2003were also published, giving a total of 20 Turkish sites (some published more than once, giving 25 postings), and two French sitespublished on the EWGLI website in 2003. In 2003, investigation reports were returned for 151 single sites, even though the EWGLI guidelines do not require such investigations to becarried out. Of these, 132 sites were sampled, and 72 (54.5%) were positive for L. pneumophila. Discussion The number of cases reported to the EWGLINET surveillance scheme in 2003 was not as high as in 2002, but still represented a significant burden of disease in European travellers. France and Italywere the main countries of infection for 2003, due in no small part to the large number of internal cases reported by these countries each year.Ifthe internal travel were to be removed, Spain and then Turkey would have been the main countries of infection. The fact that countries such as Italy and France do report their internal travel cases allows an international surveillance scheme like EWGLINET to detectmore clusters within those countries. In all, 12 countries reportedcases of internal travel to EWGLINET in 2003, one more than in 2002.In 2003, 17 out of the 18 clusters located in France would not have been detected without internal reporting (i.e. no more than one casein the cluster involved foreign travel), and six out of 14 clusters in Italywould not have been detected. The number of clusters detected because of internal reporting for Turkey (none out of 12 clusters)and Spain (two out of nine) are much smaller because of the lownumber of internally reported cases from those countries. If all countries began to report their internally acquired cases of travel- associated legionnaires' disease to EWGLINET, we would expect to seea large increase in the number of clusters detected by the scheme. Not all cases of travel-associated legionnaires' disease are reported to EWGLINET each year. The coordinating centre collects an annual dataset [6] from each country detailing every case of legionnaires'disease detected by that country, including the number of travel-associated cases acquired abroad and internally. In 2003, the differencebetween the annual dataset and the EWGLINET dataset suggestedthat 290 travel-associated cases had not been reported to EWGLINET.This is in part due to legal restrictions on reporting in some countries.However,whilst 76% of cases acquired abroad in 2003 were reported, only 57% of internally acquired cases were. Countries may believethat EWGLINET is less interested in such cases, but they are a very valuable addition to the EWGLINET dataset, as discussed above. The EWGLI guidelines for investigation of clusters were put in place in July 2002, so 2003 was the first full year of their use. Some coun-tries have experienced difficulties implementing them efficiently, and EWGLINET is attempting to help these countries adapt to the new procedures. Turkey in particular encountered difficulties managing itsinvestigations, with 20 of its sites being published on the website in2003. Improvements in this country have now occurred as a result oftheir strengthened links between the collaborators and local publichealth officials. EWGLINET collaborators and local health authorities in many countries have put a great deal of effort into thoroughly investigating the 107 sites that returned a Form A and B in 2003, and it is very encouraging that the vast majority of investigations are being carried out satisfactorily and on t ime. In addition, in one investigation, legionella isolates were obtained by England from a cruise ship asso-ciated with a cluster of legionnaires' disease, and were typed andmatched with a clinical isolate from a German patient using sequence-based methods, confirming the site as the source of the outbreak [7].The small number of clinical isolates obtained from patients limits theuse of this technique, and countries should encourage samples forculture to be taken from patients with legionnaires' disease where atall possible. Over the last few years, participants in the EWGLINET scheme have detected an increasing number of cases, and the crude fatality rate hasdecreased accordingly, as less serious cases are diagnosed and reported. Additionally, the urinary antigen test has made the process of diagnosis much faster, leading to earlier treatment of individualcases, earlier detection of clusters, and therefore earlier implementation of control measures. Despite the decreasing percentage of fatalitiesattributed to legionnaires' disease, the EWGLINET scheme continuesto fulfil a very important role, emphasised by the 39% of clusters that would not have been detected in 2003 without its internationalreach.

Joseph CA. of Legionella pneum ophila serogroup 1 offers the potential for Enteritidis salmonella se rovar identified by the Enter-net national reference laboratories in western Europe. As it is the most commonly recognised serotype, it is important that phage typing is carried out so that outbreaks can be recognised and confirme d, and trends in infections identifed. Data from the Enter-net salmonella database show that there has been a dramatic shift between phage types identified in Europe from1998-2003. In 1998, the proportion of phage type (PT) 4 was 61.8%, making it the most frequently identified phage type in humans (21 630 cases), whereas by 2003 the proportion of PT4 had fallen to 32.1% (8794 cases) with other strains increasing, both in propor- tion and numbers. This paper identifies the emerging strains that are becoming more relevant in public health terms. Euro Surveill 2004; 9(11):43-45 Published online Nov 2004 Key words : Salmonella enteritidis PT4, European network Introduction The Enter-net dedicated surveil lance network has been collating data on salmonella infections in its international database since itsinception in 1993. S. Enteritidis has been shown to be the majorserotype identified in western Europe since the late eighties [1],with data from Enter-net showing the the incidence of this serotype reducing in the mid-1990s [2]. This does not show the whole picture. As S. Enteritidis is such a major subset of all salmonella serotypes identified in Europe, it is essential for subtyping to be undertakento identify outbreaks of infection and fully evaluate the trends in infections and identify any emerging issues issues that need to beaddressed.Methods An agreed subset of data is sent to the Enter-net surveillance hub on a regular basis [3]. These data are collated in the Enter-netinternational databases, and include microbiological andepidemiological data on each laboratory case confirmed by nationalreference laboratories. The microbiological information in the salmonella database gives details on the salmonella serotypes for all 'sporadic' and 'outbreak' cases. Those countries that routinely subtype isolates also include phage type (PTs) data. Phage typing isbased on the methods of Ward et al [4], which have been adoptedby the participating Enter-net countries. The resultant data are incorporated into the Enter-net salmonella database, analysed andthe results returned to the participants within the network. Publicdomain versions of these reports are posted on the Enter-net sectionon the Health Protection Agency's website. (http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/inter/enter-net_menu.htm ). Data from fifteen countries has been collated and included in this paper:Austria; Belgium; the Czech are 178 983 S. Enteritidis cases with associated phage typing results from 1998-2003 in the database. The data analysed are only those for which a definitive phage type is given. Thosewith no information, or which were not typed, had a non-defined type (reacted with the phages but did not conform to a designated pattern), or were untypable, were excluded from the analysis (thosenon-defined types or which were untypable only excluded 2.2% ofthe records). In 1998, of the 34 998 cases with a phage typing resultfrom 12 countries, just under 62% were PT4. In contrast, data for2003 from 15 countries (27 431 cases) showed that PT4 was only32.1% of the total [TABLE 1]. Phage types other than PT4 havebecome more common over the past six years, and both the numbersand the proportion of cases of these types have been rising. * Enter-net Scientific Co-ordinator, HPA Centre for Infections, London, Uni ted Ki ngdom44 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 Discussion Data from 1998 to 2003 show that the distribution of phage types within S.Enteritidis has changed dramatically. The data that are included in the Enter-net database do not always represent all cases of salmonellosisnotified within a country as the data generally are those that are char-acterised by the National Reference Laboratory, although they are a representative sample. Analysis of these data has shown that there has been a significant increase in non-PT4 phage types of S. Enteritidis in west-ern Europe causing morbidity and mortality [5] in humans together witha decrease in S. Enteritidis PT4. The collation of data on an interna-tional basis provides the opportunity to identify trends across borders.Analysis of the data shows that a few specific phage types have contributed to the overall increase of non-PT4 types. There is evidence to show that some of these strains are related to travel. As many of the countries visited are within the EU, the changing pattern probably reflects the disease incidence within these countries [6]. S. Enteritidis PT1 with resistance to nalidixic acid, and often with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin [7,8,9], is found in travellers returning from Mediterraneancountries. Because the principal source of S. Enteritidis is chickens and egg products it is also likely that the occurrence in travellers also reflectscontamination of these foods within those countries. The increase in PT4 in Denmark is believed to be a combination of a rather late introduction of PT4 into poultry relative to other European countries,as well as imported foods, and international travel (K M\u00f8lbak, personal comm unication). In 2002, S.Enteritidis was the most common serovar in egg production; with 27 of the 43 (62.9%) positive samples in layer breeders, 366 of 634 (57.7%) positive samples in laying hens, and 221 of 303 (72.9%) positive samples from eggs. Where phage type data are available in poultry, it shows that these types are present [10]. It is possible that these other phage types are replacing the biological niche previouslyoccupied by PT4, although this requires verification.These provide some of the answers to the increase in these phage types,but there is also a need to bring together data from all the disciplines involved in surveillance of salmonellas from farm-to-fork. This will allow all those involved in public health to learn more about the whole picture including the animal reservoirs of these phage types, the contaminated vehicles and any other contributing factors (travel, food, imports) that are allowing these strains to proliferate and circulate in west-ern Europe. This paper only describes the situation in human cases inthose countries in western Europe (plus 2 from eastern Europe: theCzech Republic and Poland) that perform phage typing for S. Enteritidis strains. The picture might be very different, or indeed become clearer,if data from more countries and other disciplines were available to allow the full interpretation of these events along the whole food chain. Acknowledgement s The Enter-net Dedicated Surveillance Network is funded by the European Commission - DG SANCO under the Public Health Programme 2003-2008,grant agre ement numb er 2003 203.As the countries supplying data differ over the six years, it is necessary to look at the proportion of each phage type rather than actual numbers [FIGURE]. Fifteen countries have provided phagetyping data for some or all of the six year period,. Seven PTs make up approximately 90% of all subtyped strains of S. Enteritidis; PTs 1, 4,6, 6A, 8, 14B and 21. PT1 increased from PT4, PT6A hasdecreased from 5.3% to 3.6%. By analysing the data from the nine countries that have supplied comparable information across the whole period, it can be seen that the actual numbers of these PTs are increasing, even though the overalltrend in S. Enteritidis is decreasing [TABLE 2]. Laboratory studies are currently in progress to elucidate the relationship between the strains ofphage types that are increasing and historic strains of those types. While there are some striking differences between countries the general trends are the same, with the exception of Denmark [TABLE3]. PT8 was endemic in their poultry population and has now successfully been reduced.FIGURE S.Enteritidis phage-type trends (%) of total 1998-2003 Overall changes in S.Enteritidis phage types across nine European countries, 1998-2003 1998All 9 countries1999 2000 2001 21 561 16 821 14 173 13 599 11 308 8487 85 950 695 27 984 26 148 29 192 26 940 26 068 171 027 -24.87TABLE 3 Changes in the occurrence of S.Enteritidis phage types be- tween 1998 and 2003 PT1 distribution of human S.Enteritidis PT4 and non-PT4 infections in EU countries, 1998-2003 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 PT4 cases 21 630 17 342 14 857 14 074 725 8794 (61.8%) (59.7%) (52.8%) 16 783 16 743 18 637 cases( 38.2%) (40.3%) (47 .2%) (54.4%) (58.8%) (67 .9%) Total 34 998 29 075 28 154 30 857 28 468 27 431 Countries 12 14 15 15 15 15Euroroundup ORIGINAL ARTICLES Euroroundup INTERNATIONAL TRENDS IN SALMONELLA SEROTYPES 1998-2003 - AS U R V EILLANCE REPORT FROM THE ENTER -NET I NTERNATIONAL SURVEILLANCE NETWORK Ian ST Fisher on behalf on the Enter-net participants* EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 45This paper could not have been prepared without the contribution of all of the Enter-net participants; Management team : N Gill, H Smith, W Reilly; Austria: F Allerberger, C Berghold, Sockett; Cyprus D C Hadjianastassiou; Czech Republic : D Dedicov\u00e1, R Karpiskova, M Prikazska; Denmark : P Gerner-Smidt, K M\u00f8lbak, F Scheutz; England, Wales and A Siitonen; France : H de Valk, P Grimont; Germany : A Ammon, H Karch, H Tsch\u00e4pe; Greece: K Mellou, PT Tassios, A Vatopoulos; : Herpay, K Krisztalovics; Iceland : H Hardardottir, G Sigmundsdottir; Ireland M P I Jansone, I Selga; Lithuania* G Luxembourg F Schneider; Malta: P Cushcieri, M Micallef; the Netherlands : Y van Duynhoven, W van Pelt, W Wannet; New Zealand* : F Thomson-Carter, D Phillips, Norway: J Lassen, L Vold; Poland : A Cieslik, J Szych; Portugal : C Furtado, J Machado; Romania M Damian; Scotland: J Coia, J Cowden, M Hanson; Slovakia : Slovenia Keddy; Spain: Andersson, L\u00f6fdahl, R Wollin; Switzerland* : H H\u00e4chler, H Schmid, and all others in each of the participating institutes who provide input into the successful running of the Network, and of course Francine Stalham as the Enter-net administrator . * not funded under the grant agreement.

The international surveillance network for human enteric infe ctions, Enter-net, has been collecting and reporting data on laboratory-confirmed human salmonella infe ctions since 1993. The number of cases identi- fied rose in the mid-1990s, with the peak being in 1997 . This paper describes the subsequent decline in salmonella serotypes being reported by the national reference laboratories partic-ipating in the Enter-net surveillance network between 1998-2003.The total number of human cases of salmonellosis reported bythe Enter-net participating countries has fallen from 220,698 to 142,891 during this period. Even at these reported levels salmonel losis remains a major cause of morbidity in humans.

These data have previouslyshown that although salmonellosis in the participating countriesdeclined in the early 1990s then rose in mid-1990s [1,2], it stillremains a major public health concern. This report shows the trends in the main salmonella serotypes in the six years from 1998 to 2003. Methods An agreed subset of national data is electronically tranferred to the Enter-net surveillance hub on a regular (usually monthly) basis.These data are collated in the Enter-net international databases, andinclude microbiological (such as the salmonella serotypes and epidemiological data for all 'sporadic' and 'outbreak' casesidentified by the national reference laboratories. The data areincorporated into the Enter-net salmonella database, analysed andthe results returned to the participants within the network. Publicdomain versions of these reports are posted on the Enter-net sectionon the Health Protection Agency's web site(http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/inter/enter-net_menu.htm ). Results Twenty -four countries have supplied comparable data covering the period 1998-2003, with a total of just over 1 million records [FIGURE].Salmonella enterica serotypes Enteritidis and Typhimurium are the predominant organisms identified by the countries' national reference laboratories, making up over 80% of all isolates. For all salmonellas the general trend is declining with 77 807 fewer laboratory confirmed cases in 2003 compared with 1998 (a reduction of35.3%). Salmonella Typhimurium and other serotypes showed a slightincrease in 2001 over 2000 (but not Enteritidis) but the downward trendfor all three returned in 2002. Over the six-year period, Enteritidis fellby 36.2% from 154 928 cases to 98 915, Typhimurium by 26.6% from 25 790 to 18 937 and the other serotypes by 35.3% from 39 980 to 25 039. Discussion The incidence of salmonellosis from cases of human infections in participating countries is on the decline, although with almost 143 000laboratory-confirmed cases in 2003, salmonellosis remains a major causeof morbidity. This is a significant underestimate of the true incidence dueto underreporting, sampling of isolates in each country and other factors. Much has still to be done to further reduce salmonella infections. The added value of international surveillance networks such as Enter-net isFIGURE S.Enteritidis, Typhimurium and Typhimurium OtherLaboratory reports Yearvital in helping to identify supranational trends in infections as well as international outbreaks. Inclusion of data from all Enter-net participants will elucidate the problem in a wider range of countries. Some data from the new EU member states has been included in this report, but theextension of Enter-net should provide the opportunity for more countries to supply their data. In addition, information from non-human sources would be a valuable adjunct to those included in the Enter-net human salmonella database. While the data within the Enter-net database are comparable over time, because surveillance systems have stayed relatively stable, it is not as yetpossible to compare the disease burden between countries. T o achieve this,population-based studies similar to those done in England, France andthe Netherlands [3,4,5] are required to determine the multiplier needed toconvert laboratory confirmed cases to the number of cases occurring in the community. This should be a priority for Enter-net participating countries, to ensure truly comparable data, and to inform policy makers, public health bodies and the general public of the true burden of infection.

Euro Surveill 2004; 9(11):47-50 Published online Nov 2004 Key words : Diphtheria, Europe Introduction The epidemic of diphtheria in the Newly Independent States (NIS) began in the Russian Federation in 1990 and affected all the NIS countries by the end of 1994. The emergence of this epidemicresulted in the need for the development of modern laboratory techniques for diphtheria diagnosis and analysis. At the initiative of the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, theEuropean Laboratory Working Group on Diphtheria (ELWGD) was formed in July 1993 as a result of the epidemic situation in the NIS.In 2001, the network became `The Diphtheria Surveillance Network(DIPNET)' , and included both the epidemiological andmicrobiological aspects of diphtheria and other infections caused bypotentially toxigenic corynebacteria. The Eighth International meetingof the European Laboratory Working Group on Diphtheria (ELWGD)and the Diphtheria Surveillance Network (DIPNET) was held andco-organised with the WHO Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen, Denmark, in June 2004. Following are the main issues discussed andall they all highlight the importance of improving surveillancesystems and carrying out epidemiological studies to sustain diphtheriacont rol. Current state of diphtheria in the European Region In the last fifty years, the incidence of diphtheria in western Europe has declined dramatically. However, in 1990 a diphtheria epidemic occurred in the Newly Independent States (NIS) of theformer USSR. The epidemic began in the Russian Federation in 1990and affected all the NIS countries by the end of 1994. At the peakof the epidemic in 1995, 50 425 cases were reported in the NIS,compared with 24 cases in other countries; the NIS accounted for 88% of cases reported worldwide. Diphtheria control measureswere implemented in the Russian Federation in 1992, and mass immunisation campaigns were set up in all the Newly IndependentStates (NIS), achieving a high coverage rate ( 80% in all age groups) relatively quickly. As a result of the action taken, the incidence of diphtheria in the Russian Federation and in the NISbegan to decrease. Between 1990 and 2001, over 160 000 caseswere reported in the region with over 4000 deaths. In 2002, 1189 cases were reported from the WHO European region: 95% of thecases were from the Russian Federation and the NIS. In 2003, a totalIn particular, those countries which have provided the data that have been used in preparing this report should be thanked; Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, England, Wales and NorthernIreland, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania,Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

Many of the western, central and eastern European countries now report none or very few cases of diphtheria each year, including importated cases. Since 2003, excellent progress in the control ofdiphtheria has been achieved and the incidence has remained very lowin most of the NIS. However, in a few countries, such as Georgia,Latvia, Ukraine and the Russian Federation, the situation still appears to be problematic [2]. Sustaining diphtheria control is still a high priority for the WHO European Region and can only be achieved effectively by maintaining high population immunity in all age groups together with a goodepidemiological and microbiological surveillance system with reliable laboratory diagnosis, for timely detection, investigation and management of cases and contacts [4, 5]. Clinical, epidemiological and microbiological aspects of infec- tion caused by C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans Diphtheria is rare in western Europe and this makes it difficult to establish a standardised surveillance system. The policy for screening of throat swabs varies from country to country and only five of 19countries routinely screen throat swabs for corynebacteria [6]. If throat swabs are not screened routinely, this could result in cases being diagnosed late. Clinicians providing insufficient information tolaboratories along with mild or atypical clinical presentations in vaccinated patients may also lead to a delayed diagnosis. In Englandand Wales, between 1986 and 2003, only 14 of 90 (16%) cases oftoxigenic C. diphtheriae infection presented with classical diphtheria; 84% of cases had milder infections such as sore throat. Mild infectionscan only be detected by screening throat swabs and if routine screeningceases, more than 80% of the infections will probably not be detected. This could result in inappropriate treatment of cases, higher fatalityratios and secondary cases and increase risk of outbreaks [7, 8]. Most cases of diphtheria result from infection with toxin producing strains of C. diphtheriae .However, strains of C. ulcerans found more commonly in cattle than other animals, can carry the same bacterio- phage that codes for the toxin produced by toxigenic strains ofC. diphtheriae .H u m anC. ulcerans infections are usually acquired through contact with animals or by eating or drinking unpasteuriseddairy products [9, 10, 11]. However, such risk factors have not beenidentified for some cases of classical diphtheria caused by C. ulcerans,which suggests that there may be other routes of infection [12]. In 2001,a case of diphtheria-like illness in a Japanese woman caused by toxigenic C. ulcerans was documented. The patient had no direct contact with dairy livestock or unpasteurised dairy products, but a week before illness onset, the patient had be en scratched by a cat, which had rhinorrhea [13]. T oxigenic C. ulcerans has also been isolated in the UK from domestic cats with bilateral nasal discharge [14, 15] and recently C. ulcerans was isolated from a 47-year-old French woman with severe sore throat and dyspnea who had close contact with an infected dog. Molecular typing confirmed that the human isolate andthe dog isolate had indistinguishable ribotypes. Molecular and genetic characterisation of Corynebacterium diphtheriae Data on the analysis of genome sequence of Coryn ebacterium diphtheriae NCTC 13129 has been reported [16]. The data can be obtained from the GeneDB website(http://www.genedb.org ). The genome sequence data will permit the discovery of novel virulence factors and factors responsible for colonis-ing the host. Sequencing the genome of a non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae strain and also a C. ulcerans strain in future would give further insight into specific virulence mechanisms associated with these organisms and therefore may help to clarify the role of these organismsas emerging pathogens. The international nomenclature for Coryn ebacterium diphtheriae ribotypes has now been established and a database of all recognised ribotypes has been built and requires regular updating [17]. Ribotyping is an effective and a discriminatory typing method, which can be usedto study the global epidemiology of Coryn ebacterium diphtheriae .I t is still the most recognised and straightforward method for typingCorynebacterium diphtheriae isolates and the ribotype database should facilitate global communication between typing laboratories [17]. A study which analysed 302 toxigenic C. diphtheriae 2001-2003 and 974 non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae isolatedbetween 1996-2003 from Russia, showed that among the toxigenicstrains, the biotype gravis was most common and amongst the non-toxigenic strains, biotype mitis was most common [18]. Among the non-toxigenic strains, 164 were non-toxigenic tox-bearing strains(NTTB) (these strains possess the tox gene, however, they do notexpress toxin phenotypically). Ribotyping strains isolated between 2001-2003 revealed 12 ribotypes amongst the toxigenic strains and nine ribotypes amongst the non-toxigenic strains. The predominant ribotypes amongst the toxigenic strains were St. Petersburg, Rossija, Otchakov, Cluj, Londinium The majority of ribotype Moskva, however recently, three new ribotypes (provisionally named as NTTB1, NTTB2 and NTTB3) have been documented amongst the NTTB strains isolated from Moscow [18]. The role of NTTB strains is still uncertain in the epidemiology of diphtheria. The isolation rate of NTTB strains varied from year to year.To establish mutations in the tox gene, NTTB strains were analysed by peptide nucleic acid (PNA)- mediated PCR clamping. Deletion of one guanine of four between positions 52-55 leading to a DNA openreading frame shift, and a nucleotide substitution in position 60 (adenine to guanine), which did not result in an amino acid substi-tution were revealed in all strains. These results were confirmed by direct sequencing of the tox gene. The epidemiological significance ofNTTB strains and reasons for these particular mutations are currently been investigated [19]. Diphtheria immunity: strategies and sero-epidemiological studies The European Sero-Epidemiological Network (ESEN-2) [20], based on the original ESEN project was established in 2001 [21], and the net-work undertook an evaluation of several diphtheria antibody test kits.. A panel of 150 human serum samples were tested by eight partic- ipating laboratories. cell toxin neutralisation assay (VCA) only assay that measures functional antibodies and is thereforeused as the reference in vitro assay. Comparison of the results obtained50001000015000200002500030000350004000045000Russian Federation NIS 198019821984198619881990199219941996199820002002Number of cases YearFIGURE Reported diphtheria cases from the Russian Federation and all other NIS countries between 1986-2003from the different laboratories revealed a high correlation between the VCA results (R2> 0.9). Comparison of the VCA results with results obtained from other assays such as the double-antigen (T oBI), (PHA) and two commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits revealed that there is good correlation between the VCA and theDA-DELFIA, DA-ELISA, T oBI and the PHA assays (R 2> 0.8). There was poor correlation between the two ELISA kits and the VCA (R20.6). Therefore, these ELISA kits, even though cheaper and simpler to usethan neutralisation tests, lack sensitivity for serum samples containinglow levels of antitoxin and are not recommended for use [22, 23]. However,a new enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with an improved correlation to the Vero cell assay (VCA), which is available commercially from Binding Site Ltd, United Kingdom, was tested and compared with the VCA. Thirty-four serum samples from the Respiratory and Systemic Infection Laboratory, HPA, Colindale, UK were tested using the EIA and the results were compared with those obtained by the VCA. Linear regression analysis showed excellent correlation between the assays (R 2 = 0.974). Using WHO guidelines of 0.01-0.1 IU/mL as minimum protective level, and >0.1 IU/mL asprotective, only 2 of 34 samples gave discordant results. However, bothsamples had VCA results within one doubling dilution of the EIAresult. The EIA assay measuring range was 0.004 - 3.0 IU/mL. Intra- assay percentage coefficient of variation was found to be between 5.8%and 2.7% by testing 0.06, 0.71 and 2.6 IU/mL samples times. Assaylinearity was assessed at serum dilutions of 1:100 - 1:128000 using three positive samples. Comparison of the achieved and expected values by linear regression gave values of (R 2= 0.998, 1.000 and 0.999 respectively. As the two assays produce very similar results,the newly developed EIA could be a possible alternative to the VCA. Useof an EIA assay offers significant advantages in terms of cost, speed, easeof use and adaptability to automation than the kits used previously [24]. Studies performed on immunity to diphtheria in various countries such as, Russia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Turkey and Brazil have shownthat in spite of mass immunisation programmes, there are still manyadults who have inadequate immunity levels and are susceptible todiphtheria. The age group with the lowest levels of immunity variesfrom country to country and probably depends on the year that childhood immunisation programme was implemented on a routine basis [25, 26]. Immunity induced by childhood immunisation usuallywanes and if adults do not receive booster doses of diphtheria toxoid,they become susceptible to the disease [25, 27, 28]. ConclusionDiphtheria made a dramatic return in eastern Europe and remains a serious disease throughout many countries of the world. The eastern European epidemic has clearly shown that diphtheria will always return whenever immunity levels decrease and highlights theimportance of childhood vaccination, maintenance of immunity inadults, and the role of socioeconomic conditions in the spread ofdiphtheria. Also, with increasing international travel and the emergenceof epidemic clones, the existence of diphtheria anywhere in the worldposes a threat to the unimmunised and those persons with low levels of immunity. These problems further highlight the importanceof microbiological and epidemiological surveillance and the use of newmolecular methodologies. The changing epidemiology of the diseaseposes a threat and ongoing efforts to further enhance our under-standing of this disease must continue.

Directia de sanatate publica, Brasov, Romania Published online 4 November 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/041104.asp) On 16 October 2004, a single bear was reported to have attacked several people in the forest surrounding Brasov, a city of 400 000 inhabitants, in Transylvania, central Romania. One man, who waspicking mushrooms deep in the forest, was killed by the bear, and 11others, who were picnicking near the edge of the forest, were wounded,seven severely. The local hunters association sent a hunter who shotthe bear dead several hours later. The local public health authorities took the wounded to the local hospital, where the seven with severe injuries underwent surgery. All11 patients received tetanus anti-toxin as post-exposure prophylaxis.One of the severely injured patients, who had diabetes, died in hospital on 17 October. A special commission to handle the incident was established in Brasov, composed of public health directorate staff and local veteri- narian staff. On 17 October, the local veterinary authorities in Brasov county reported an initial diagnosis (made by direct immunofluorescence) of rabies in the bear. Virological and histopathological examinations carried out by these authorities confirmed the diagnosis the next day.This was also confirmed by the Institutul National pentru SanatateaAnimala Bucuresti (National Institute for Animal Health in Bucharest) on 19 October. Following the diagnosis, the local public health authorities imme- diately began to list all people associated with the event, includingthose who were involved in medical care and transportation of thewounded, so that they could all be offered post-exposure rabies vaccination. All 11 of the wounded people received antirabies serum and rabies vaccine (first dose). A total of 97 people were vaccinated against rabies. The public health authorities will follow the completion of the post-exposurevaccination scheme.WESTNILE OUTBREAK IN HORSES IN SOUTHERN FRANCE : SEPTEMBER 2004 H Zeller1, S Zientara2, J Hars3, 1.

The quarantine means a vaccination campaign for all animals in the zone, including oral vaccination for foxes;controls on the movement of animals in the zone; restricting human circulation in the zone, and increased surveillance of animal health in the zone. Completion of rabies immunisation for all dogs in Brasov county Increased public information campaigns regarding rabies, via television, radio and newspapers Prophylactic immunisation to be offered to all those with no record of immunisation and who work in forested areas in Brasov county In 2003, there were two reported cases of rabies in foxes near Brasov; one in a village 75 km from Brasov city and the other less than 15 kmfrom the city. There have been no other cases reported so far in 2004.The likely source of the bear infection is other woodland animals,possibly foxes or rodents.with the Vero Cell Assay.

Laboratory guidelines for the diagnosis of infec- tions caus by Corynebacteri um diphtheriae enzyme immunoassay for anti-diphtheria antibodies giving improved correlationOn 28 August 2004 (week 35), two suspected clinical cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in horses were identified by veterinarians in Saintes-Maries de la Mer, in the Camargue region of southeastern France [FIGURE 1]. ELISA tests were performed on blood specimens from these horses by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sanitaire desAliments (the French food safety agency), and WNV IgM and IgG antibodies were detected on 10 September. An alert was sent to the national authorities on 13 September 2004. By 30 September 2004 (week 40), 37 suspected cases in horses, including 4 fatalities or euthanasia, were reported. Fourteen of the 18 horses tested were positive for WNV (WNV IgM detection or positiveRT-PCR) [FIGURE 2]. The most common clinical symptoms were fever, prostration, anorexia, ataxia, paresis and irritability. The CentreNational de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence des Arbovirus (national reference centre for arboviruses) in Lyon confirmed the presence of specific neutralisingantibodies in 3 cases (PRNT80 titre >160).The suspected cases were distributed over an area extending about 35km west and north from the initial focus, Saintes-Maries de la Mer.Saintes-Maries de la Mer is situated in the Rh\u00f4ne delta where migratingand resident birds are numerous. The infected area covered around thesame region where a previous WNV outbreak in horses occurred in 2000(131 suspected cases/76 confirmed cases from late August until earlyNovember) [1]. No human cases were reported in 2000 and none in 2004 by week 39. After the 2000 outbreak, an integrated programme of WNV surveillance involving partners from the ministries of agriculture,public health and the environment, as well as local agencies, was initiated. It covered 3 d\u00e9partements: H\u00e9rault, Gard and Bouches duRh\u00f4ne [2]. Sentinel birds (chicken and ducks) were tested for WNV antibody detection on a re gular basis. Suspected cases in horses and humans were tested for WNV infection. Dead wild birds were collected for WNV testing. Because of the limited WNV outbreak in Frejus (in the Var department, 200 km east of the Camargue) in 2003 which involved 7 human cases (3 encephalitis and 4 cases of febrile illness) and 4 equine cases, the 2004 sentinel bird surveillance programme was extended along the Mediterranean coast to cover 6 d\u00e9partements from the eastern Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es to the Var, as well as the report of suspected cases in humans and horses [3]. A low level of WNV activity was reported in the Camargue region in sentinel birds: one seroconversion in 2001, one in 2002 and none in2003. In late July 2004, a WNV seroconversion was reported in a sentinel chicken from Saintes-Maries de la Mer, and a second seroconversion was reported in mid-August at the same location. On6 September 2004, two thirds of the sentinel birds from this flock werepositive for WNV antibodies. A sentinel duck was reported to be positive for WNV on 16 August (infection confirmed on 7 September 2004) in Saint-Just, H\u00e9rault. Following the alert on 13 September several measures were taken: Increased surveillance for de tection of suspected cases in human and equine populations Entomological studies at areas where infected horses have been found A restriction on blood donations from individuals living in or with history of travel to the infected area until the end of October 2004 An absence of WNV viral genome was reported in a retrospective study on 789 blood donations collected from donors in the infected region from the beginning of August 2004 to mid-September.

A further worryingdevelopment is the decline in effe ctiveness of fluoroquinolones in treating Escherichia coli infections [1]. Over the past five years (1999-2003), the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS, http://www.earss.rivm.nl ) has collected antimicrobial susceptibility test results of invasive iso-lates of five bacterial species that serve as indicators for the develop-ment of antimicrobial resistance in Europe. The species included areS. pneumoniae ,S. aureus ,E. coli ,Enterococcus faecalis ,and Entero coccus faecium .At the end of 2003, the EARSS database contained information on 178 040 isolates from 791 laboratories serving 1300 hospitals in 28countries. The high proportion of erythromycin resistance (18%) among invasive S. pneumoniae isolates remains remarkable. Thirty-five percent of the erythromycin resistant S. pneumoniae isolates were also resistant to penicillin. At the same time there are early indicationsthat penicillin resistance in invasive S. pneumoniae is declining in some countries (Belgium, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom). Trends in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) levels vary considerably across Europe. There has been a steady annualrise in many countries including some countries with hitherto low overall resistance rates. For the observation period 2000-2003, a significant increase in the proportions of MRSA was observed inBelgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom.The increase reported by the Scandinavian countries and theNetherlands is at a much lower level but the trend must be taken seriously since a low critical level, after which it is hard to controlMRSA levels, may exist but is not well defined. In Britain, the relentlessincrease of MRSA proportions among bloodstream infections that occurred between 1992 and 2000 seems to have stabilised. EARSSdata show no further increase in the last three years [Figure 1]. Thisis consistent with data from the Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia surveillance scheme in England. For the majority of countries the proportion of vancomycin- resistant E. faecium (VRE) isolates remained less than or equal to 5%, but 4 countries reported resistance above 15%. In some countries reporting higher levels of VRE, these were probably due to outbreaks ofE. faecium in care facilities and fluctuations in trends can be expected. The low number of reports did not permit far-reaching statistical conclusions. There has been a widespread decline in the effectiveness of fluoroquinolones in treating E. coli ,at a time when fluoroquinolones have become one of the most frequently prescribed antibiotic classes. This trend, already observed from 2001 to 2002, continued in 2003 andwas statistically significant in seven countries (Austria, Bulgaria, CzechRepublic, Germany, Spain, Hungary, and Sweden). At the same time, it seems unlikely that sampling error could account for the statisticallynon-significant but consistent increase in eight other countries [FIGURE 2]. This development is accentuated by the finding ofincreasing resistance against third generation cephalosporins and increasing numbers of strains with co-resistance to several drugs.Infectio ns with E. coli are becoming increasingly difficult to treat and serious therapeutic limitations are foreseen. One of the newly launched initiatives is the EARSS internet-based information system (EARSS-ibis). EARSS-ibis is a professional internet-based communication tool. With EARSS-ibis, rapid communication between laboratories to announce isolation of bacterial pathogens with unexpected antimicrobial resistance, virulenceor transmissibility is possible. This improves the early recognition ofthese agents by all network participants. Sharing the experience anddiagnostic detail with other laboratories will increase the awarenessand diagnostic accuracy, be of immediate benefit to the treatment ofpatients and strengthen the ability of the entire network to assess therisk imposed by potentially harmful bacterial pathogens to populations. Participating laboratories will have access to the EARSS-ibis report system and to their national and European database. This system is intended to provide timely information that is also relevant and accurate. 52 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 FIGURE 1 Staphylococcus aureus :invasive isolates resistant to methicillin (MRSA) from 2000 to 2003 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% (275) Belgium Bulgaria Czech Rep Germany Denmark Spain Finland Greece Ireland Iceland Italy Luxembourg Malta Netherlands Portugal Sweden Slovenia Country ( average number of isolates per year)Proportion resistant2000 2001 2002 2003 Austria (766) (86) (930) (430) (520) (816) (507) (214) (697) (53) (175) (162) (92) (1 238) (273) (1 624) (246) (1 524)Uk FIGURE 2 Escherichia coli :invasive isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones from 2001 to 2003 0%5%10%15%20%25%30% (332) Belgium Bulgaria Czech Rep Germany Spain Finland Greece Israel Iceland Luxembourg Malta Netherlands Portugal Sweden Slovenia Country ( average number of isolates per year)Proportion resistant2001 2002 2003 Austria (621) (93) (1 470) (503) (58) (1 925) (1 284) (431) (791) (82) (179) (77) (1 850) (372) (2 543) (397) (101) SlovakiaEstonia Croatia (390) Hungary (282) Poland (93)About EARSS EARSS has been devised as the first publicly funded international monitoring tool for antimicrobial resistance in the European Regionand indeed worldwide, able to provide official, validated and com-parable resistance data for five major indicator bacteria.

Health Protection Agency West Midlands Regional Surveillance Unit, England 2. Department of Public Health & Epidemiology, University of Birmingham, England Published online 16 December 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/041216.asp) A secondary effect of influenza in childhood is the impact - medical, social and economic - on the family. Two recently published studies have considered how the vaccination of children against influenza may help control the spread of influenza through indirectprotection of susceptible persons. An Italian study [1] conducted prospective multicentre research into children with respiratory tract infections (RTI) to determine the burden of laboratory confirmed influenza in healthy children and theirhouseholds. Altogether, 3771 otherwise healthy children aged <14 yearsand presenting to primary care centres and emergency departments withsymptoms of RTI were followed up until the resolution of their illness; 352(9.3%) were positive for influenza virus. Children with laboratory confirmed influenza were significantly more likely to present with fever (p<0.0001) and with croup (p<0.0001). They also had significantly longermean school absence (5.10 days (standard deviation (SD) 2.55) versus 4.25days (SD 2.93), p<0.0001), although the prevalence of hospitalisationwas similar. The households of influenza positive children had signifi-cantly more respiratory tract infections (15.1% versus 9.5%, p<0.0001),medical outpatient visits (p<0.0001), lost work for theirown illness; and, p<0.0001 for their child's illness) and lost school days for siblings (p<0.0001). The results of this study suggest that influenza is likely to be transmitted to household contacts and has a substantial household impact in terms of illness and lost school and work days. The authorsconclude that these effects could be reduced by the vaccination of healthy children. However, there were no significant differences inhospitalisation rates between the groups, no information on the agesof other siblings that might determine both sibling and parental absence, or any mention of loss-to-follow up. A study from the United States [2] performed a non-randomised community-based controlled trial in five communities to assess the benefit of vaccinating children with cold-adapted intranasal influenzavaccine. Healthy children aged 18 months to 18 years in two of thecommunities were offered vaccine for three consecutive years. The analysis was restricted to members of a particular health plan,which, in the intervention towns, comprised approximately half ofthose vaccinated and covered approximately two thirds of the population, but covered only about 10% of the population in thecomparison towns. Any differences between the health plan popula- tion and the rest of the population are not described. Age-specificrates of medically attended acute respiratory illnesses during the influenza outbreak period were calculated for both the interventionand control communities. Altogether, 20%-25% of eligible childrenin vaccination communities received vaccine each season, which wasgenerally a good match to the circulating virus. The authors reported a significant indirect protection in adults aged 35 years and over although percentage differences in illness rate betweenthe intervention and control arms appeared quite small: 17.6 %compared with 18.6% in year 1, 17.1 versus 18.8% in year 2, and 15.1 versus 17.8% in year 3, giving a protective efficacy (1 minus relative risk) of 8% (95% confidence interval years 1-3 respectively.This small effect may be translated into quite a substantial absolutenumber of consultations when multiplied up for population size, but appeared to have little effect on herd immunity during the influenzaepidemics. This may be partly explained by the low uptake of lessthan 25% and may be diluted by using clinical rather than laboratoryendpoints. Studies with a higher uptake rate, a randomised designand larger numbers of communities are needed to define the levels ofindirect protection that could be achieved. The evidence for the protection of the community against influenza by vaccinating children is limited. There are several randomised controlled trials which address the protection of house- hold or school contacts inadequatel y,usually as a lower order out- come measure for which the study is not designed [3-8] Until now, only one community intervention trial [9] and one large ecological'natural experiment' in Japan that assessed the effects on the wider community of vaccinating school children, had been made [10]. Both are suggestive of population benefit, but not necessarily con-clusive. The US study [2] had a similar design to the community in-tervention study [9], but examined a larger number of communities and had a more consistent system for identifying respiratory illness(although it also had incomplete follow-up). Unfortunately, vac-cine coverage was only about one quarter of that in the earlierJapanese study. There is considerable variation in influenza vaccination policy in Europe - a table showing the current recommendations is available on the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme website(http://www.eiss.org/html/vaccination.html ). The most common policy is to target high-risk groups (such as the elderly). This,however, can never be fully successful, despite high coverage, as influenza vaccine has lower efficacy in these patients, particularlyfrail, elderly people. There is evidence that children play a major rolein the transmission of influenza to vulnerable persons [11]. Therefore,a complementary strategy would be to provide indirect protectionby vaccinating children, which would also have the benefit of direct protection to those vaccinated. Indeed, to reduce disease in childrenthe US has recommended vaccination of all aged 6-23 months since2003. Both of the studies reviewed suggest that indirect protection couldbe achieved in the community by the vaccination of healthy children.However,neither provides sufficient evidence to support this claim or to warrant the intervention at present, particularly at the levels of vaccine coverage observed.

Both a positive antibody res ult with ELISA and haemagglutination tests can be induced by other flaviviruses and certain immunisations (for example, yellow fever, tickborne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis,and St Louis encephalitis), and so it is necessary to determine whetheran immunisation or infection with one of these agents could be thecause of such cases. The patient in this case had been immunisedagainst yellow fever in 1992. A neutralisation test, which in Germanyis currently only done at the Robert-Koch Institut, is still necessary,and will be carried out shortly. West Nile virus fever is not currently itself notifiable in Germany, so cases are notified as 'health threats' .

REPORT : PRO BABLE WESTNILE VIRUS INFECTION INGERMANY COULD BE THIRD IMPORTED CASE SINCE 2003 E Jensen1, G Pauli2 1. Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr Lebensmittelsicherheit und Verbraucherschutz, Jena, Germany 2. Robert Koch-Institut, Berlin, Germany Published online 8 December 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/041208.asp) Transmission of West Nile virus infections within Germany via bites from mosquitoes that have had contact with migrating birds is thought to be a possibility, although no such transmission has yet been re- ported. Imported cases are also possible in people returning fromareas of high virus prevalence. In 2003, a 77 year old man from LowerSaxony and a 51 year old woman from Bavaria became ill with WestNile virus infections after travelling in areas of high prevalence in the United States (US). A third probable case has recently been notified, and is reported here. A 77 year old woman from Weimar became ill on 20 September 2004 during a tourist trip to California in the US lasting from 4September to 4 October. She developed acute encephalitis with fever,and experienced continuous impaired consciousness over a few days.The patient was treated in hospital in the US from 20-30 September,and West Nile virus infection was suspected. After her return toGermany, she experienced further symptoms of memory impairmentand muscle weakness and was treated in hospital on 11 October. Theresults of serological tests indicated an acute West-Nile infection: anti-flavivirus IgM ELISA test of blood serum and cerebrospinalfluid was positive, and according to haemagglutination tests, anti-West Nile IgG 1:160 positive and serum 1:2560/5120. In view of the results, clinical presentation and the case history (the patient reported an insect bite during a stay in an epidemic area),a West Nile virus infection is very likely, but further confirmationINCREASE IN CASES OF LEGIONELLOSIS IN ITALY MAINTAINED IN 2003 M C Rota1, M L Ricci2, M G Caporali1, S Salmaso1 1. Centro Nazionale di Sorveglianza e Promozione della Salute, Instituto ed Immunomediate, Instituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, Rome, Italy Published online 2 December 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/041202.asp) In Italy in 2003, 617 cases of legionellosis were reported to the national surveillance system, maintaining the recent increase seen first in 2002. The characteristics of the patients were very similar tothose reported in 2002, and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 was the cause in 90% of cases [1]. Legionellosis has been a mandatory notifiable disease in Italy since 1983. In addition, there is an independent ad hoc surveillancesystem, which collects information on possible source of infection, clinical presentation and diagnostic tests performed. At the end of each year, information from both systems is matched. Casereports not obtained from the special surveillance system are followed up by the local authorities. Despite this dual information system, thenumber of cases of legionellosis in Italy is underestimated, as some cases may not be reported by physicians, or not diagnosed. Cases identified in foreign patients infected in Italy are collected via the European Working Group on Legionella Infections Network (EWGLINET, http://www.ewgli.org/ ). In 2003, 617 reports of legionella were sent to the Instituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (ISS): 571 confirmed, and 46 probable. The Department of Infectious Disease, Parasitology and Immunology atthe ISS confirmed 95 cases, based on testing of clinical samples or isolates. Just three regions accounted for 72% of cases: Lombardy,Piedmont and Lazio. The remaining 28% were from 14 regions and2 independent provinces. Onset dates of cases peaked in summer and autumn [FIGURE 1].The outcome for all cases was known for 57% cases. 87.5 % recovered and 12.5% died [TABLE 2]. Diagnostics and causative agent The most common diagnostic tool was urine antigen testing (86%), followed by serology (9%), and in 4% of cases, diagnosis was basedon the isolation of microorganisms from clinical samples in the respiratory tract. Six percent of cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or direct immunoflourescence. Only in 9% of cases was more than one technique used to diagnose legionellosis. In some stages of infection with legionella, antigen is not present in urine. Urine antigen detection is also not able to detect species orserogroups other than Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 - which means that cases are underestimated. It is recommended to use morethan one test for diagnosis. In 90% of cases, the cause was Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (this was isolated in 25 cases and in 531, was diagnosed by urine antigen testing). For the remaining 10%, diagnosis was serological.In one case, the serogroup identified was Legionella pneumophila serogroup 7. International surveillance of travellersInformation about foreign tourists who contracted legionellosis in Italy is collected by the European Working Group on Legionella infections,based at the Health Protection Agency, London, United Kingdom. 113 Italian tourists acquired legionellosis in 2003 (these were not notified through EWGLI as they were internal cases). In the 2 weeksbefore onset of illness, 70% had stayed in a hotel, 17% in privatehouses, 4.5% on a campsite, and 8.5% in another place. Most were trav-elling in Italy, only 11% travelled abroad. There were a further 81cases in foreign tourists travelling in Italy. A cluster is defined by EWGLI as two or more cases linked to the same accommodation within two years ( http://www.ewgli.org/scien- tific_info/scientific_methods.asp ). In 2003, 20 clusters were notified to the ISS involving 49 tourists (21 Italian, 28 foreigners). In all ac- commodation, epidemiological and environmental investigations were implemented, and legionella was isolated from samples in 95% of these places. In 16 places of accomodation, the concentration of le-gionella was more than 103 colony forming units/litre. In each building, control measures were implemented, and the buildings subsequently tested negative for legionella. TABLE 3 Travel associated LD cases in foreign tourists visiting Italy by country of residenceCharacteristics of patients were similar to what has been reported in previous years. Age distribution was similar with 70% of patientsover 50 years. The median age of patients was 59 (range: 13-99). The ratio of male patients to female was 2.4 to 1. Data on the occupation of the patient was also collected - but this was not available for 12% of cases. Fifty percent were retired, 17% were craftworkers (e.g plumbers, builders), 5% housewives, 1% students, 10% other. Risk factors, possible exposure and outcomes Data on possible infection sources in the 10 days before symptom on- set were available for 35% cases. Of 617 cases, 76 had been in a hospitalor clinic and 113 cases (18.3%) had stayed at least 1 night away fromhome (hotels, campsites, other accommodation). Twenty patients (3%)had been to a swimming pool, and 5 cases had undergone dental treat-ment. Of all legionellosis patients, 59% had simultaneous chronic diseases. Between August and October 2003, a cluster involving 15 people infected in Rome was identified. This was linked to a contaminatedcooling tower of a department store.In Piedmont and Tuscany, two hos- pitals notified 19 and 6 healthcare-associated legionellosis cases respectively (confirmed or probable). Overall, 76 healthcare-associated legionellosis cases were notified in Italy in 2003. Most of these wereisolated cases or small clusters (2-3 cases).TABLE 1 Cases of legionellosis notified in Italy according to region and year EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 55Region Cases noti fied in Cases notified in Cases notified in 2001 2002 2003 Piedmont 61 96 72 Val d'Aosta 4 8 3 Lombardy 122 244 288Bolzano 0 1 1Trento 4 6 4Veneto 10 67 35 Friuli Venezia 4 5 4 Giulia Liguria 9 17 11 Emilia Romagna 38 42 30Tuscany 22 57 48Umbria 1 2 6Marche 4 1 4Lazio 29 65 83 Abruzzo 1 0 0Molise 0 0 0Campania 2 4 4 Apulia 9 17 6Basilicata 0 3 7Calabria 0 1 2 Sicily 3 0 5 Sardinia 2 3 4Total 325 639 617 FIGURE 1 Cases notified by month of onset of symptons in the period 2001-2003 0102030405060708090100 JanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJuly August mber2001 2002 2003Number of cases Country Number of tourists Austria 2 Belgium 1 Denmark 3France 37.8% Mean of total 12.5% TABLE 2 Case-fatality rate (%) of notified casesIn 2003, 42 674 new consultations (an increase of 8%) were registered within the STI sentinel surveillance network. Genital chlamydial infection was the most common diagnosis. The number of diagnoses of chlamydia (n=3731) remained stable between 2002 and 2003 and gonorrhoea decreased by 16%. Men and women youngerthan 25 years of age are at highest risk: two thirds of all female diagnoses of chlamydial infection and gonorrhoea were seen in womenyounger than 25 years. In men, these percentages were 30% and 21%, respectively. Compared with genital chlamydia, gonorrhoea (n=1396) tends to occur more focally, with higher rates in urban areas, among MSM (61% of male cases) and individuals with a history of STIs(50%). Specific ethnic minorities (for example, those from Surinam,Netherlands Antilles and Aruba) are at high risk of both genital chlamydia and gonorrhoea. In 2003, the percentage of ciprofloxacin resistance, in a survey among public health laboratories, increased to 9% of tested isolates[2]. In Amsterdam for the first time, resistance was higher in MSM thanin heterosexuals, as has also been observed in the United Kingdom andthe United States [3-5]. Diagnoses of syphilis (n=506) in the Netherlands increased by 10% between 2002 and 2003. This is lower than the 78% increase seen between2001 and 2002. 403 diagnoses of syphilis were made in MSM account-ing for 87% of the cases seen in men. The rise in syphilis is associatedwith a number of outbreaks in Amsterdam [6] (50% of the diagnoses in 2000-2003) but also in other parts of the country, including Rotterdam[7], The Hague, Utrecht, Groningen and Twente region. Since 2000, thenumber of cases in men has increased by 208%. The outbreak of lymphogranuloma venereum in the Netherlands was first reported in Rotterdam but soon cases were reported retrospectively throughout the country. The LGV outbreak seems to be increasing, with yet unknown dynamics, and with clinical signs thateasily could be missed. As of 1 September 2004, 92 confirmed caseswere reported in the Netherlands [8]. The LGV outbreak was seen predominantly among HIV infected MSM. More recently, outbreaks were reported in Antwerp [9], Paris [10], Stockholm [11], and Hamburg [12]. Also, in the US, a first case of LGV serovar L2 was reported [8]. The ulcerative character of LGV facilitates transmission and acquisition of HIV and other STI and bloodborne diseases. In 2003, 829 clinic attendees were infected with HIV and were aware of their infection. This represents only 2% of the total number of consultations and is undoubtedly an underestimate of the realnumber due to underreporting. However, 20% of all diagnoses of gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and syphilis in MSM are seen inknown infected MSM. Among these, anorectal infections wereseen in 84% of the diagnoses of chlamydia and in 57% of gonor-rhoea. Surveillance data indicate that unprotected anal intercourse is highly prevalent, which was also observed in the HIV preventionmonitoring of MSM [13]. In 2003, unprotected anal sex was more of-ten reported than in 2000 [13]. We may conclude that unsafe sex practices are ongoing in this group at risk for STI, with consequencesfor further spread of STIs and HIV . ConclusionRates of STIs show great variation across populations at risk (e.g. high rates in young people, MSM and migrant populations). In2000-2003, the situation among MSM has deteriorated with seriousepidemics simultaneously occurring within this group. The currentsituation requires innovative responses from public health. Additionally,secondary prevention should be reinforced to provide prompt diag-nostics and adequate treatment. Next to the expansion of STI clinics'capacity, as announced by the Dutch Ministry of Health for 2005, in-novative approaches need to be implemented (i.e. method of pre-screening; improved facilities for testing www.syfilistest.nl (GG&GD Amsterdam), www.soatest.nl (Soa Aids Nederland)). The surveillance of STIs and HIV/AIDS in the Netherlands has improved considerablythe past few years. Further improvements can be achieved with respectto completeness and timeliness. Other surveillance areas needing 56 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 INCREASE IN STI SI NT H E NETHERLANDS SLOWED IN2003 M van de Laar, ELM Op de Coul RIVM, Bilthoven, Netherlands on Published online 2 December 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/041202.asp) The increasing trend in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the Netherlands observed over the past few years, appeared to stabilise in 2003. The number of genital chlamydial cases remained stable andthe number of gonorrhoea cases decreased by 16%. However, thecontinuous of syphilis and the outbreak of Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) among men who have sex with men (MSM), indicate an increase in sexual risk behaviour [1]. HIV/AIDS As of August 2004, a total of 9767 HIV cases have been reported in the Netherlands. At the end of 2003, an estimated 16 400 peoplewere living with HIV/AIDS nationally. Men who have sex with men (MSM) still account for the majority of notified cases, although theproportion has decreased over time. The increase in heterosexuallyacquired infections, as observed in re cent years, seems to have levelled off in 2003. Of all 847 newly diagnosed HIV infections in 2003, MSMand heterosexuals accounted for 44% each and The majority of the non-Dutch heterosexuals acquired the HIV infection abroad; in sub-Saharan Africa and to alesser extent in Latin America and the Caribbean. HIV prevalence inthe Netherlands is highest among MSM (0-22%) and IDUs (0-26%).HIV prevalence among heterosexuals varies from 0 to 1.4% (rangesvary depending on the place of testing; STI clinics and HIV test sites).In 2004, national screening of HIV in pregnant women began in the Netherlands. The HIV prevalence was 0.06% in the first half of 2004. Sexually Transmitted InfectionsIn 2003, STI surveillance in the Netherlands was converted into an STI sentinel surveillance network (including five STI clinics and ninepublic health services). The former STI surveillance network includedtwo STI clinics and 39 public health services. Data for the differenttime periods has become difficult to compare, so results should be interpreted with caution.Conclusions and recommendationsThese cases confirm an increasing trend, already observed in 2002. The incidence in Italy is approximately 11 cases per million which issimilar to that in other European countries (approximately 10 casesper million). Numbers of healthcare-associated and travel-relatedcases appear to be stable and similar to 2002 levels, although there hasbeen an increase in clusters. The 20 clusters that were detected in2003 represent a threat to the travel industry. Since 95% of buildingswith a cluster tested positive for environmental legionella, routine measures to tackle legionella growth are required. Prevention measures are also required in hospitals to reduce cases, especially asin 2003, some deaths were seen even in younger age groups.

Mice expressing valine at PrP 129 developed a different type of disease with differentneuropathological and molecular phenotypes and a different rate ofsecondary (within-species) transmission.Four distinct forms of the disease-related prion protein (PrPSc) have been found in the brain tissue of patients with CJD: patients with classical CJD have PrPSctypes 1-3, and patients with vCJD have type 4 PrPSc[2,3,4]. Codon 129 of the human PrP gene encodes either methionine or valine. This polymorphism appears to criticallyaffect the susceptibility of humans to prion diseases. All vCJD patients (i.e. patients with type 4 PrP Sc) tested to date have been homozygous for methionine at codon 129. In this study, mice strains with the human PrP gene instead of the mouse PrP gene (transgenic mice) were given intracerebral inoculationwith brain tissue from vCJD patients and cows with bovine spongi- form encephalopathy (BSE). All the mice that were homozygous formethionine at human PrP codon 129 developed clinical disease andneuropathological signs typical of vCJD, as well as having type 4 PrP Sc. Mice that were homozygous for valine at human PrP codon 129 responded quite differently: only 50% became infected and they developed type 5 PrPSc. Type 5 was first described by the same researchgroup in 1997 [5], also in mice studies. Type 5 PrP Schas type 4-like glycoform ratios but gives type 2-like digestion products after treatment with proteinase K, and is associated with very weak diffuse PrP deposition in the brain in contrast to the florid PrP plaquesassociated with type 4. The study went on to investigate the within-species transmission of these PrP types, i.e. transmission without a species barrier, and assuch, a model for human-to-human transmission of prion disease.Within-species transmission of prion disease typically has a high (100%) attack rate. Surprisingly, the brain inocula derived from fourclinically-affected mice that were ho mozygous for valine at human PrP codon 129 failed to transmit clinical disease or asymptomatic prion infection to other valine homozygous mice of the same breed.Furthermore, when methionine homozygous mice were inoculated with brain tissue containing type 5 PrPSc from the valine homozygous mice, some (10 of 13) developed sub-clinical infections with type 4PrP Sc and 3 of 13 developed clinical prion disease with type 2 PrPScand a neuropathology that resembled that of human sporadic CJD. These findings indicate that codon 129 polymorphism determines the ability of human PrP to form the various types of PrPSc,and also the disease phenotype resulting from infection with BSE and vCJDprion. Specifically, human PrP 129 valine appears not to be a compatible substrate for the type of prion (type 4) seen in vCJD. The authors recommend determination of PrP Sctypes amongst all human patients with prion disease. This may further contribute to our understanding of patterns of human prion disease in relation to exposure to BSE or iatrogenic sources of vCJD, and also guard against missing BSE-related infections that present as disease that resemblessporadic CJD more closely than vCJD. Based on these animal models, and therefore with caution, the authors conclude that human infection with BSE-derived prions maynot be restricted to a single disease phenotype, but may result in sporadic CJD-like or novel phenotypes in addition to vCJD, with thetype of disease experienced depending on the genotype of the host source of the infection, and the genotype of the recipient.

This was the firsttime an increase in annual reported cases had been observed since1992 (7515 cases were notified in 2001). However, this increasecould have resulted from the change in the notification system in 2001, which may have caused underreporting that year. The generallong-term decrease in tuberculosis incidence in the past 10 years iscontinuing. In 2002, the incidence of tuberculosis in Germany was 9.3 per 100 000 inhabitants. The incidence in males was 11.7, 1.7 times higherthan in females (7.0 per 100 000). Information on the organ mainly affected was available for 7388 cases, and in 5950 cases (80.5%), this was the lungs (pulmonary tuberculosis). The incidence of potentially infectious (sputum smearor culture positive) pulmonary tuberculosis was 5.2 per 100 000, withmales being two times more affected than females (7.1 and 3.4 per 100 000, respectively). The incidence of non-infectious pulmonary tuberculosis was 2.0 per 100 000. Information on patients' citizenship was available for 96% of cases (7365). Tuberculosis incidence in people of foreign citizenship was 31.9per 100 000: 4.8 times higher than incidence in German citizens (6.7per 100 000). Compared with 2001 data, no major changes were observed. Information on patients' country of birth is also now routinely collected. Patients born outside Germany represented 42% of cases. This confirms that information on citizenship (only 31.8 %of patients held foreign citizenship) underestimates the proportion ofpeople of foreign origin among tuberculosis cases. In 2002, there were 349 reported cases of tuberculosis in children under 15 years of age (an incidence of 2.8 per 100 000 children),compared with 291 reported cases in 2001. Although the number of cases in children with foreign citizenship was approximately the sameas in German children (165 and 166, respectively), children with foreign citizenship were 9 times more affected than German children.The highest incidence was in children under five years old. In thisage group, tuberculosis incidence in children with foreign citizenshipwas 19.3 per 100 000, and thus 8 times higher compared with Germanchildren of the same age group (incidence 2.4 per 100 000). Five (1.4%) children had generalised tuberculosis of the meninges or central nervous system. Two (0.6%) had disseminated tuberculosis. The proportion of drug resistant cases remained approximately the same as in 2001, although there was a slight increase in 2002.Cases which were resistant to at least one of the five first line drugs total. An increase in isoniazid and streptomycin resistance wasobserved. Resistance to other anti-tuberculosis 2001: 2.3%). Resistance was associated withcountry of birth and history of previous treatment, and was higher in foreign-born cases. 58 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 2002 was the first year when data were collected on treatment outcome for the previous year. The proportion of successfully treated patients (defined as treatment fully completed or cured) was 78%.This is below the World Health Organization target of 85%. Analysisaccording to age group showed that patients under 40 years of age weresuccessfully treated in 85% or more of cases, but in patients over 60years, this fell to 72%. This can be partially explained by the increase in deaths in older tuberculosis patients either from tuberculosis orother causes, meaning that the treatment cannot be completed.Successful outcome in patients with drug resistant tuberculosis was lower than in patients with drug susceptible tuberculosis (65.1%versus 80.7%). Tuberculosis in 2003 Preliminary results of tuberculosis epidemiology in 2003 in Germany are in line with trends observed in 2002. The incidence of cases fulfilling the reference definition in 2003 decreased from 9.3 to 8.7 per 100 000 (7184 cases), continuing thelong-term trend downwards. As in 2002, males were almost twice as affected as females (inci- dence: 11.0 and 6.4 per 100 000, respectively). Men over 30 years oldwere particularly affected. However, in the 15-30 years age group, men and women were equally affected. Incidence in older age groups(>69 years) was notably higher; men in this age group had an inci-dence of about 22 per 100 000. In children under 15 years, incidence continued to decrease. In 2003, 285 cases were notified: with an incidence of 2.3 per 100 000 children, this was slightly less than the 2001 incidence. In children, incidence was about equal in boys and girls. About two thirds of notified cases (4679) were in patients with German citizenship, but of 6819 cases for whom information aboutcountry of birth was known, 56% were born in Germany and 44% abroad: this ratio has remained the stable over the past few years.Incidence in patients according to country of birth cannot currently be calculated, as country of birth for people with German citizenshipis not collected for the general population. However, the analysis ofpatients in 2003 according to country of birth showed that 72% ofpatients were born in Europe, 21% in Asia, 6% in Africa and 0.5% inthe Americas. Information on the organ mainly affected was available in 7004 cases (98%). In 5609 cases (80%), this was the lung or tracheo-bronchial tree (pulmonary tuberculosis). In 1850 of these 5609 pul-monary cases (33%), this was the particularly infectious smear-positiveform (incidence 2.2 per 100 000). In comparison to other European countries, the proportion of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis is relatively low. Tuberculosis affecting the lymph nodes, pleura and, with increasing patient age, urogenital tuberculosis, were the most com-mon extra-pulmonary forms. Drug resistance is becoming a particular challenge in Germany: 2.1% of all cases were multidrug resistant, and 2003 saw continued increase in the proportion of cases that are resistant to at least onefirst-line medication (currently 13%, 2002: 12.1%). The preliminary analysis of the data on treatment started in 2002 showed that a successful treatment was reported in 77% of cases.This has remained unchanged compared with 2001. Data on treat-ment outcome were available for 91% of all reported cases (2001:80%). This remarkable increase in reported outcome data in 2002demonstrates that case-based reporting of treatment outcome is becoming a routine component of tuberculosis surveillance. References 1.

Institut Scientifique de Sant\u00e9 Publique, Brussels, Belgium 2. Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre (VAR/CODA/CERVA), Brussels, Belgium Published online 28 October 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/041028.asp) On 18 October 2004, a Thai man travelling from Bangkok to Brussels was apprehended by customs officials at Brussels interna- tional airport, and found to be illegally carrying two mountain hawk eagles ( Spizaetus Nipalensis ) in his hand luggage [1]. These birds were wrapped in a cotton cloth, with the heads free, and inserted headfirst in a bamboo tube around 60 cm in length, with one end (the feetend) open [2]. The two tubes were in a kind of sports bag, with thezip not totally closed to allow some air to enter. The birds were immediately put into quarantine at the airport by the Federal Food Safety Agency (FA VV/AFSCA). They later testedpositive for avian influenza H5N1, which is currently circulatingwidely in southeast Asia, and were euthanised. The H5N1 diagnosis was made using a haemaglutination inhibi- test using monospecific chain reaction (PCR). Sequencing is ongoing. The highpathogenicity of the virus was confirmed using the intravenous pathogenicity index. Results were available on 22 October, testing wascarried out at the Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre(VAR/CODA/CERV A), Brussels. Sequence data of the virus will be available from the CODA/CERV A veterinary health Belgian reference laboratory next week. The information will be sent to the World Animal Health Organisation(OIE, http://www.oie.int ) reference laboratory in Weybridge, United Kingdom and the World Health Organization H5 reference laboratory. The Thai man, who received prophylactic treatment on 24 October, travelled to Vienna from Bangkok on 17/18 October with EV A Airways, flight number BR 0061, and then got a connecting flight to Brusselson 18 October with Austrian Airlines, flight number OS351. Passengerson these flights were advised to get medical advice if they had any flu-like symptoms (cough, fever, rhinorrhoea). Twenty-five people who had been in direct or indirect contact (same room) with the infected eagles (custom officers, a veterinarian,laboratory staff, as well as the Thai passenger and his brother) wereexamined and received oseltamivir prophylaxis. Swabs (2 nasal and 1 throat) from 23 people (21 custom officers, the Thai passenger and hisbrother) were tested on 24 October 2004. A tear swab was also collectedfrom the veterinarian, who developed bilateral conjunctivitis threedays after having handled the birds. His family was given prophylaxis. Swabs were tested using two nested RT-PCR: types A and B, and H5 sub-type, at the division of Virology, Scientific Institute of PublicHealth, Belgium, Brussels. All results (including the tear swab) were negative for H5. Other birds had also been kept in the airport quarantine area between 18 October and 23 October (day of controlled disinfection), andtherefore were potentially exposed to the avian influenza virus.Approximately 200 parrots and 600 smaller birds that had been in contact with some of these birds were culled preventively in Belgium, by FAVV/AFSCA. All PCR tests on samples from these birds have been negative so far. Other birds had already been shipped to the Netherlandsand Russia. The authorities of these countries have been informed. The eagles had been ordered by a Belgian falconer who offered 7500 Euro for each bird. This falconer already owned four other EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 59eagles of the same species. These two birds detected by customs may reflect a much larger underlying problem of bird smuggling into European Union member states. They easily remain undetected because airport scanners only detect metal objects. Specific methods for the syste matic detection of live animals (e.g. dogs) should be considered at EU airports and borders. In February, the European Commission banned imports of live birds and poultry products from countries in south Asia, including Thailand,and Malaysia, [3,4]. This ban has been extended to 31 March 2005. References 1European Commission. Avian flu: illegal imports of birds of prey from Asia - possible exposure of flight passengers.

Half of the patients had had sex ingay saunas and discos, and 80% reported using condoms for anal sex,but none of them had used condoms for oral sex [4]. More recently, in September 2004, a possible case of lymphogran- uloma venereum (LGV) was diagnosed in the STI Unit of Barcelona,in a local gay man. This patient had a sex partner who was diagnosedwith LGV in Amsterdam. This was probably associated with one of a series of outbreaks of LGV that have been reported during the past yearin western European cities [5]. Further cases of LGV are expected. The resurgence of syphilis and other STIs in Barcelona reflects a trend of increasing risk behaviour in MSM, a notable proportion of whom are HIV positive, thus raising concerns about HIV transmission[6]. Public heath responses so far have been limited to the control ofthe hepatitis A outbreak, through vaccination and information fromhealth centres and gay organisations. References 1.

Around 80% of the casesof infectious syphilis in these outbreaks were diagnosed in men whohave sex with men (MSM) engaging in high risk behaviour, includingunsafe oral sex. Most of them were of European white ethnicity andaround 40% were co-infected with HIV [2]. In Barcelona, increasing numbers of infectious syphilis cases were first noticed in 2001 [3]. T o characterise this outbreak, diagnoses ofinfectious syphilis among attendees of the outpatient STI clinic ofBarcelona during the years 2002 and 2003 were reviewed. Between 2002 and 2003, 102 cases with infectious syphilis in patients with a median age of 34 were seen (40 in 2002 and 62 in 2003).Of these cases, 95% were in men, 86% of whom were MSM (80% in2002 and 90% in 2003). 68% of the cases were in Spanish-born patients, 19% were in Latin American-born patients and 9% were inpatients born in other western European countries. HIV status was known for 85 (83%) of the cases: 31/85 (37%) were HIV positive. Of these 85 cases, 75 were in MSM, 29 (39%) of whom were HIV positive (this can be further broken down into menwho reported having sex only with other men, 38% of whom were HIVpositive, and men who reported having sex with both men andwomen, 46% of whom were HIV positive). Of the 10 heterosexual men and women for whom HIV status was known, 2 were HIV positive.At least three-quarters of HIV positive patients were aware of their status. Comparing trends in infectious syphilis from the same STI clinicin Barcelona, the number of diagnoses in 2002-03 represents an increase of >500% in relation to The outbreak of syphilisis ongoing.YERSINIA PSEUDOTUBERCULOSIS INFE CTIONS TO RAW CARROTS IN J Takkinen1, S Kangas2, M Hakkinen3, U M Nakari1, H Henttonen4, Siitonen1, M Kuusi1 1. National Public Health Institute (KTL), Helsinki, Finland 2. National Food Agency, Helsinki, Finland3. National Veterinary and Food Research Institute (EELA), Helsinki, Finland 4.Finnish Forest Research Institute (METLA), Vantaa Research Centre,Finland Published online 7 October 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/041007 .asp) In March 2004, the number of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis notifications increased suddenly in Finland compared to previous months. Overall, 125 cases were notified to the National InfectiousDiseases Register, NIDR, ( http//www3.ktl.fi/stat/ ) between 1 January and 31 July 2004. Of the cases, 57 were women and 68 men. The me-dian age was 26 years (range 1 to 81), and 43% were under 20 yearsof age. The incidence was highest (4.6/100 000) in children under 10years of age and decreased steadily to 0.5/100 000 in adults over 60 years of age.The epidemic curve shows two major peaks, the first in March-April and the second in June-July, 2004 [FIGURE]. The first peak occurred mainly in Central and Northern Pohjanmaa (English name:Ostrobothnia); the second peak showed more cases in the HelsinkiRegion and other parts of Finland. In March, an outbreak was detected among schoolchildren in one municipality. Only 4 (3%) cases were re-ported from the school outbreak to the NIDR. All human strains(n=24) that had been sent to the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens bythe end of May were of the serotype O:1. In the school outbreak investigation, preliminary case interviews suggested that grated carrot was a possible vehicle of infection. Resultsof the case-control study based on the school menu showed that a cabbage and grated carrot meal served in March was the probablesource of the outbreak (crude OR: 3.5, 95% CI 1.0-16.1). Food samples (n=8) stored between 29 March and 13 April in the centralschool kitchen and including grated carrots were available for microbi- ological investigations. All food samples were culture-negative for Y. pseudotuberculosis. The food processing plant that delivered all fresh food products to the kitchen was investigated by the local health authorities. One environmental sample from the carrot peeling line yielded Y. pse udo- tuberculosis supporting the hypothesis of raw carrots being vehicles of infection. Additional food and environmental samples were collectedfrom two farms supplying carrots to the fresh food processing plant.In one farm, Y.pseudotuberculosis was isolated from fluid of spoiled carrots and from mouldy carrots at the National Veterinary and FoodResearch Institute ( EELA, http://www.eela.fi/fi/index.html ). This farm, located in Central Ostrobothnia, produced between 300 000 - 400 000kg carrots last year, and served mainly Central and NorthernOstrobothnia. From the suspected farm, 20 000 kg of washed carrotswere delivered in consumer packages through a large national wholesaler in southern Finland between 6 May and 10 June 2004. Domestic carrots for human consumption are usually consumed by the end of March next year but some large farms have been able to provide carrots even up to July of the following year after harvesting(personal communication). During a storage time of many months,some carrots become spoiled and liquefy. Y.pseudotuberculosis is not easy to cultivate from food and envi- ronmental samples. The culturing method used for food includes en- richment for three weeks at 4 degrees Celsius and cultivation on two selective agar plates after each week (EELA 3503, in house method).In the current investigation, Y.pseudotuberculosis was detected in the fluid from spoiled carrots after one week's enrichment, indicatingthere were high levels of bacteria in the fluid. As Y ersinia spp. are psy-chrotrophic bacteria, they are able to survive and multiply at low temper atures. PFGE studies showed that the macrorestriction profiles of DNA of 17 out of 24 human strains in 2004 were indistinguishable from thoseof the isolates from the mouldy carrots, fluid of the spoiled carrots,and shrews from one single farm. The isolate from the carrot peelingline in the fresh food processing plant was different from the typedetected in the farm but identical with 7 human strains. PFGE studies are ongoing. The role of shrews and voles in disease trans-mission deserves further investigations and is in progress. Wild animals have been suspected as the reservoir of Y. pse udotu- berculosis [1]. The vole population had a cyclical peak in western Finland in 2001-2002, and declined until the spring 2003 [2]. Rodent researchersfrom the Finnish Forest Research Institute ( http://www.metla.fi/ ) sam- pled the surrounding fields of the implicated farm in June 2004, whensmall mammals populations were still low. Two field voles was caught. The pooled intestinal sample of the shrews was positive for Y. pse udotuber- culosis ,but not the pooled intestinal sample of the voles. Y.pseudotuberculosis causes acute gastroenteritis characterized by fever and abdominal pain resembling appendicitis often leading to unnecessary appendectomies. Some patients may develop post infectious complications, like reactive arthritis and/or erythema nodosum [1,3-5]. In 2003, a similar outbreak caused by Y. pse udotu- berculosis serotype O:1 was traced to carrots produced on one farm [3]. In 1998, a Y.pseudotuberculosis serotype O:3 outbreak in Finland was traced to iceberg lettuce [1]. References 1. Nuorti JP , Niskanen T, Hallanvuo S, Mikkola J, Kela E, Hatakka M, et al.

Project Leader (Epidemiology), European Surveillance of Sexually Transmitted Infections (ESSTI) Published online 7 October 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/041007 .asp) Enhanced surveillance of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in England was started on 4 October 2004 by the Health Protection Agency [1]. This was in response to reports of increases in cases of proctitis seen at several genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics. Theaim of this initiative is to improve the diagnosis and control of LGVin men who have sex with men (MSM). The study seeks to: define aclear LGV case definition; raise awareness of LGV in clinical andpublic health colleagues and MSM; improv e case detection specifically in MSM, and establish laboratory confirmation by genotyping ofChlamydia trachomatis .A series of outbreaks of LGV in western Europe have been reported over the past year. In December 2003, a cluster of cases of LGV was reported in MSM in Rotterdam [2,3]. By 1 September 2004, 92 cases had been confirmed (30 in 2003 and 62 so far in 2004) and many patients had had multiple sexual contacts abroad,including in the UK. More recently, outbreaks in Antwerp [4] (27cases confirmed so far), and Paris [5] (38 cases confirmed so far) havebeen detected. Cases have also been detected in Stockholm [6] andHamburg [7]. These outbreaks have been concentrated in sexual networks of MSM in large cities, and appear to have been associatedwith the sex party scene. Most patients have been of white ethnicity and HIV positive. High levels of concurrent sexually transmitted infections (gonorrhoea,syphilis, hepatitis B (HBV), genital herpes, hepatitis C (HCV)) werealso seen. Transmission of HCV has been associated with the LGV outbreak in Rotterdam. All current European cases so far reported have been the L2 genotype, and the majority of patients presented with proctitis. Contact tracinghas been of limited use as most cases report multiple sexual contacts,mostly anonymous. So far there is no indication that LGV has spreadoutside this specific sub-group. The European Surveillance of Sexually Transmitted Infections (ESSTI, http://www.essti.org/ ) network established a working group to facilitate information exchange on lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in May 2004 [8]. LGV is caused by a type of C. trachomatis that is endemic in areas of Africa, Asia, South America and the Caribbean, but has been rarein western Europe for many decades. In the past, the few detectedcases were considered to have been imported. LGV infection may facilitate the acquisition of other STIs (including HIV) and bloodbornediseases. Details of the enhanced surveillance, including the current case definition, laboratory referral request forms and the outbreak questionnaire, can be found at http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/top- ics_az/hiv_and_sti/LGV/lgv.htm .

The increase in measles activity, particularly since May, hasbeen widespread in the country. The incidence of measles has been highin recent years, notably in 2003 [FIGURE 1] and 2000, when there wasa large outbreak (over 1600 cases reported, including three measles-associated deaths in children) [2,3]. So far in 2004, 68%of all notified cases have been reported by the Eastern Regional Health Authority (incidence: 14.2/100 000). Mostcases notified were clinical, and 60 (20%) were confirmed. Y oung children were most affected, with the highest age-specific incidence rates occurring among those <1 year of age (157.8/100 000) (Figure 2). *Patient age was unknown for 3 measles cases Enhanced surveillance data (where available) indicated that 77% of measles cases were in unvaccinated patients. In Ireland, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is routinely recommended for children at 12-15 months of age, with another dose recommended at 4-5 years of age. The vaccine can be given to children as young as 6 months old, particularly in outbreak situations, although seroconversion rates are lower in children immunised before their first birthday [4]. A recent report on immunisation uptake in Ireland during the first quarter of 2004 estimated national MMR uptake at 24 monthsto be 80%, ranging from 74%-90% between regions. 62 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 FIGURE 1 Measles cases by week of notification 2003 and weeks 1- 36, 2004 (provisional data) 01020304050 1591317212 529333 7414549534 8121620 24283236 Week 2 Age Specific incidence or measles cases notified in Ireland from weeks 1- 36, 2004 by age 15.52.8 0.6 1.8 0.27. 48Collection of national immunisation uptake data started in Ireland at the beginning of 1999. Following the measles outbreak in 2000, the uptake rate of MMR increased to 83%, but then fell to 69% at theend of 2001. MMR uptake rates have been increasing gradually sincethen [FIGURE 3]. The low MMR vaccine uptake rates in Ireland are thought to be due to the negative publicity surrounding MMR vaccine. Consistent MMR uptake levels of at least 95% are required among all birth cohorts toeliminate measles transmission. Preventing ongoing transmission in specific settings In response to the increased number of measles cases reported in 2004, the following control measures are taking place: Since good surveillance data are fundamental to control and prevention activities, measles surveillance and control activitieshave increased across Ireland (case investigation, laboratorytesting where appropriate, and encouraging immunisation). G eneral practitioners (GPs) and clinicians have been advised to notify any suspect cases promptly to ensure rapid implemen-tation of control measures. Immunisation is offered to all children in affected schools, cr\u00e8ches or institutions. In areas where substantial numbers of measles cases were reported among infants, measles vaccination of infants as young as 6 months was encouraged as an outbreak control measure. T here has been national and regional press coverage (newspaper articles, radio coverage) of measles and low levels of vaccination.Parents have been advised by GPs, Health Boards, and the National Disease Surveillance Centre to have children vaccinated with MMR at 12-15 months as per the national immunisation schedule. Parents of older, unvaccinated children have also been encouraged to bring them to their GPs for immunisation. A national Measles Eradication Committee has been established and will meet shortly. It will consider ways to improve surveillance(including laboratory testing) and vaccination uptake.

Health Protection Agency Specialist and Reference Microbiology Division, London, United Kingdom Published online 23 September 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040923.asp) Twenty seven suspected cases of wound botulism in injecting drug users (IDUs) were reported to the Health Protection Agency (England and Wales) between 1 January and 25 August 2004 [1]. Twenty fiveof these were in England, and six were laboratory confirmed. Of theconfirmed cases, three occurred in London during January and February, and the remaining three in northeast England during June and July. Reports of suspected cases cont inue to be received, especially from northeast and northwest regions. In comparison, there were 14 reports of suspected cases of wound botulism among IDUs reported for the whole of 2003, seven of whichwere confirmed by laboratory tests. Between March 2000 and December 2002 there were 33 clinically diagnosed cases in IDUs in the United Kingdom and Republic ofIreland: none were reported before 2000 [2]. Twenty of these 33 cases were confirmed in the laboratory by either detection of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin in serum, or culture of C. botulinum from wound tissue or pus. During September and October 2002 there was an outbreak of eight cases possibly related to a contaminated batchof heroin [3]. Wound botulism occurs when spores of C. botulinum contaminate a wound, germinate and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Allof the wound botulism cases detected so far in the UK have beenamong IDUs. Those IDUs who intent ionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or intramuscularly may be particularly vulnerableto infection. Clinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with an afebrile, descending, flaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early in the course of the disease and should not bedelayed for the results of microbiological testing. In cases of woundbotulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse after antitoxintreatment. C. botulinum is sensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole. As well as these cases in the United Kingdom and Ireland, wound bot- ulism in IDUs in Europe has previously been reported in Switzerlandand Norway [4,5]. It is suspected that this type of botulism is underre-ported. The authors would be interested to get information on any sus-pected cases of wound botulism in IDUs from other countries in Europe.

The overall distribution of cases by gender was 42% male, 57% female and 1% unknown. There was an equal gender distribution in children under five years. There are more female casesthan male in those over 70 [FIGURE 3]. This probably reflects the ageand gender differences in the Swedish population (7.5% of women are>70 years of age, compared with 5.2% of men). The age, sex and spatial distribution of laboratory confirmed cases may not reflect thetrue distribution of norovirus infection in the population at large. In the 2003-2004 season, laboratory confirmed norovirus cases occurred in areas of high and low population density [FIGURE 4]. Thiscould reflect the distribution of the laboratories and reflect local interest in obtaining samples, as there was a noticeable geographical 64 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 New norovirus surveillance system in Sweden S Martin1,2, Y Andersson1, KO Hedlund1, J Giesecke1. 1.

Published online 23 September 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040923.asp) Norovirus is recognised as a leading cause of gastroenteritis. During the 2002-2003 winter season, a marked but unquantified increase in cases and outbreaks of gastroenteritis associated with norovirus wasnoted in Sweden, stimulating a demand for a surveillance system tobe set up for the 2003-2004 season. Three components of the surveillance system were required: laboratory surveillance, sentinel surveillance and mapping ofcirculating strains. The laboratory surveillance el ement was operational for the 2003- 2004 winter norovirus season. This report is concerned with the laboratory data from that period. Sentinel surveillance and mappingof circulating strains are planned for the 2004-2005 season. The objectives of the laboratory surveillance were to identify spatial clustering, the demographic characteristics of laboratory confirmed cases, and early detection of any abnormal seasonal increase in cases and trends. This surveillance remit does not include information on the setting of cases, as this will be included in the sentinel surveillance. Nor does it include the reporting of outbreaks,which is covered by the Milj\u00f6kontoret (Environmental HealthProtection Board) and the County Medical Officers. The surveillance method is a voluntary, laboratory based system, using all 12 of Sweden's norovirus testing laboratories. The case definition is a norovirus positive result from ELISA, polymerase chainreaction or electron microscopy. Data from individual cases are sent weekly to Smittskyddinstitutet (SMI, Swedish Institute of Infectious Disease Control). The SMI aggregated data are also sent weekly to the county medical officers,infection control nurses and laboratories [FIGURE 1]. All 12 laboratories participated in the surveillance. From week 43 of 2003 to week 25 of 2004, the laboratories transmitted 99% of alltheir weekly reports to SMI. A total of 4776 patients were tested, 692of whom tested positive for norovirus infection (14.5%). Peaknorovirus activity was around week 9 of 2004 [FIGURE 2]. Determination of the number of patients tested for norovirus and the proportion of positive results, has the added value of acting as acrude check on laboratory methods. It may also indicate the possi-ble presence of a new strain. Viruses are characterised both in locallaboratories and at the SMI.FIGURE 1 Data flow for laboratory surveillance of norovirus infections.

The laboratory surveillance system was introduced after a thorough consultation process and feedback from the laboratories and was well supported by the public and private sectors.

This potential event had already been considered in an opinionby the Scientific Steering Committee advising the European Commission in April 2002 [3]. Although the prion agent responsible for BSE has not been found to occur naturally in sheep and goats, both have been infected experimentally. It is likely that small ruminants ate the same feed that spread BSE in cattle in the 1980s and 1990s, and there is the concernthat a BSE infection could be masked by scrapie, which occurs naturally in both sheep and goats. Earlier in 2004, an unusual TSE wasdetected in a sheep in the UK, although this was subsequently confirmed not to be caused by the same prion causing BSE [4]. Precautions already implementedAs a result of these concerns, removal of some specified risk material (SRM) has been implemented for sheep and goat carcasses,as well as cattle, for some time. Currently, the spleen and ileum of allsheep and goats are removed as SRM during meat processing.In addition, the skull, including brain and eyes, tonsils and spinal cord,are designated SRM in sheep and goats aged over 12 months. An extensive monitoring and surveillance regime for scrapie and BSE has been in place for sheep and goats ( http://europa.eu.int/comm/ food/food/biosafet y/bse/goats_index_en.htm ), and since 2002, over 1 million animals have been tested. Given this widespread testing,the finding of isolated cases of BSE would not indicate that there is awidespread problem. Furthermore, the goat population in the EU is very small (12.7 million compared with 89.2 million sheep in 2003). Among sheep, widespread testing has been done, mostly in the UK since it has the highest incidence of BSE, and all testing results so far havebeen negative. For cattle, Regulation 999/2001 specified risk material is the ton- sils, intestines from the duodenum to the rectum, and the mesenteryin cattle of all ages, and the skull excluding the mandible but includingthe brains and eyes, and spinal cord, as well as the vertebral columnin animals over 12 months old (certain extra measures apply to theUK) [5]. Proposed future precautions A draft proposal for revised food safety measures if the finding of BSE in the goat is confirmed, was discussed at an EU TSE WorkingGroup on 30 November 2004 and will be subject to further discussion in the coming months. One proposal is to extend the list of tissues thatare designated as specified risk material (SRM) in goats of all ages toinclude: The whole alimentary canal The organs of the thoracic and abdominal cavities (including lymph nodes) The pre-femoral and pre-scapular lymph nodes The entire head The tonsils Spinal cord would remain SRM in goats over 12 months old. These proposals would remove most of the tissues that are potentially infective. Ifthese proposals do become EU law, national domestic legislation would need to be changed accordingly. As the proposed revisions may apply to goats only, there will be the additional challenge ofdifferentiating between sheep and goat carcasses after slaughter. A'goat tag' may be needed. The proposals will be discussed at the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (ScoFCAH), early in 2005. References 1. European Commission.

(http://europa.eu.int/eurlex/pri/en/oj/dat/2001/l_147/l_14720010531en00 010040.pdf )Methods Two of the authors (JM and DJW) applied both the January 2004 and September 2004 [3,4] algorithm to all events (n = 30) that wereconsidered sufficiently significant to be published in the Communicable Disease Report Weekly (the national surveillance bulletin for Englandand Wales, http://www.hpa.org.uk/cdr/ ) of 2003 [5] .The Director of the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC), AN, alsoindependently reviewed the same series of events to provide an expertview on which events should have required notification to WHO. Case reports of the three diseases requiring obligatory notification andthe nine diseases requiring assessment using the algorithm were identified from discussions with CDSC departmental heads. ResultsTwelve of the thirty infectious disease events reported in the United Kingdom during 2003 would have been notified to WHO according to the decision algorithm. Both the January and September 2004 algorithms identified the same events. Expert review indicated that bothinstruments did not miss any significant events that should have beenreported. Events that would not have required reporting, according to the algorithm, were also independently judged to not require reporting.But some events assessed by the algorithm to require reporting to WHO, for example a legionella outbreak on a cruise ship and an imported case of cutaneous leishmaniasis, would probably not meritaction or assessment by WHO, though it would seem reasonable thatWHO should be aware of them. Concerning the three diseases requiring obligatory notification (SARS, polio and smallpox) there were only nine cases of probableSARS (one confirmed case). Only one of these represented an event(suspected SARS transmission) that would have required notificationto the WHO through the proposed algorithm i.e. the significant event was not the single case but the suspected transmission in the UK [5].There were no cases of polio during 2003 in the UK. In 2003, there were 11 isolates of Vibrio cholerae 01 or 139 identified from samples submitted in the UK. However, none of these patients suffered a severe clinical illness typical of classical cholera and all of these cases were imported from endemic areas. Notification toWHO would not have been required according to the algorithm. Noother diseases listed in the September 2004 version were identified inthe UK during 2003. DiscussionThe decision algorithm was highly sensitive and specific in this validation exercise but the diseases listed in Annex A and B of theRegulations added little to the particular experience in the UK during 2003. However, this may not be the case for other parts of theworld. Case definitions for the three obligatory diseases are needed to clarify what events need to be notified. For example, it is unclearwhether 'polio' includes vaccine-acquired paralytic polio and whether'smallpox' includes skin conditions being investigated to exclude smallpox. The algorithm in its current form may be overly sensitiveand result in unnecessary work for WHO. It may be useful to distinguish between events that require urgent notification for assessment and events that WHO simply need to beaware of. Clinical or laboratory definitions of the diseases listed would also be helpful and improve consistency in reporting. ConclusionThe decision instrument (algorithm) developed by WHO was highly sensitive and specific in identifying outbreaks and incidents thatcould potentially represent international health emergencies requir- ing assessment. However it may have been overly sensitive in that itidentified a number of outbreaks and incidents that WHO shouldprobably be aware of, but would not require their assessment. Diseaselists added little except to indicate diseases that should be run throughthe algorithm. Further guidance on application of the algorithm 66 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 Proposed new International Health Regulations 2005- validation of a decision instrument (algorithm) J Morris, D J Ward, A Nicoll Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, Health Protection Agency Centre for Infections, London, United Kingdom Published online 2 December 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/041202.asp) The International Health Regulations (IHR) are the official legal instrument that aims to prevent international spread of infectious diseases whilst not interfering unnecessarily with the movements ofpeople or goods [1] The current regulations are disease-based:notification to the World Health Organization (WHO) is required whena single case of cholera, plague or yellow fever is diagnosed. The regula-tions were last modified in 1981 and, over the last two decades, it has become apparent that they are inadequate for dealing with new andemerging infections. A commitment to revise the current IHR was madeat the World Health Assembly in 1995, and the revision process has beenunderway since then [2]. The emergence of SARS and avian influenzain 2003-4 has made the need for revision clearer and more urgent. After some years of development, WHO published the proposed radical changes to the IHR in January 2004 [3]. The most significant change is that member states will be required to notify WHO of any event that could potentially be a public health event or emergency of international concern. The Regulations will therefore cover all existing infectious diseases as well as new and re-emerging diseases. They will also include chemical incidents of international importanceand outbreaks of diseases where it is initially unclear whether an infection, toxin or poison is involved. WHO published proposals of the International Health Regulations in January and September 2004 [4]. An algorithm as a decision instrument was included in both versions (Annex 2, pages 42 to 45,September version). In addition, the September version has threediseases (SARS, polio and smallpox) that must be notified to WHOand nine diseases (cholera, crimea-congo Marburg, nipah virus encephalitis,pneumonic plague, yellow fever) that must be assessed using the algorithm. The algorithm is intended to help national authorities toassess whether any outbreak, incident or event should be notified toWHO as a potential public health emergency of international concern. Using the first (January 2004) and revised (September 2004) versions of the decision algorithm, we sought to determine the number of public health (infectious disease) events, which occurred in the United Kingdom in 2003, that would have been notified toWHO. We then validated this with expert review.would be helpful, such as a technical manual with worked examples for the algorithm and any disease lists (including case definitions). References 1.

Possible transmission of SARS within [accessed 22/11/2004] Some other western European countries are seriously studying the issue and making budgetary provisions for introduction of HB vaccine into their vaccination programmes, sometimes in a restrictedway. In the Netherlands, in addition to a risk group approach,offering HB vaccination is recommended for children who have at leastone parent who was born in a HB highly endemic country. In Denmarkseveral new initiatives have been undertaken since 1999 to help improve surveillance and prevention of hepatitis B. For daycare institutions, a new recommendation was introduced in 1999 for vaccination of both staff and children exposed to a carrier in a daycare setting. In addition, national guidelines are currently being re-evaluated and the need for universal childhood HB immunisation assessed [11,12]. All countries in central and eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States (former Soviet Union) have now started universal neonatal, infantor childhood immunisation programmes; 11 of these countries areworking with the support of the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation ( http://www.vaccinealliance.org ) [13]. Most of these countries have since 2000 seriously progressed towards the implemen- tation of universal HB immunisation, reaching coverage rates over 90%. In some very low endemic countries in western Europe, where the HBsAg carrier rate is under 0.5%, hepatitis B is viewed as a limited public health problem that for the moment does not justify additional expenses on the health care budget. The United Kingdom,Ireland, the Netherlands, and the Nordic countries choose to provide hepatitis B vaccines only to well-defined risk groups, in addition toscreening pregnant women to identify and vaccinate exposed newborns. For these countries, there is a need to show irrefutably thebenefits of a universal programme, in addition to that of a targeted programme. Risk group vaccination policy identifies individuals often when already infected, misses a substantial part of the respectiverisk groups and will not be able to control further transmission at country level. Immunisation strategies targeting multiple risk groups have failed so far to provide adequate coverage in the United Kingdom[14]. In the Netherlands (HBsAg-carrier rate 0.2%), after 20 years ofrisk-group vaccination, hepatitis B virus still circulates in the men who have sex with men (MSM) group, and Dutch blood donors wererecently shown to have acquired the strains circulating in the MSM group [15]. Risk group vaccination (particularly MSMs, commercial sex workers and clients, heterosexuals with multiple partners, drug usersand newborns with immigrant parents) has recently been substantiallyintensified. In addition, the increasing number of immigrants moving to Europe, often from highly endemic regions, is leading toa profound change in the hepatitis B epidemiology of low endemiccountries [12,16].

Published online 18 November 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/0 41118.asp) Much progress has been made since hepatitis B (HB) vaccine became available two decades ago. An increasing number of countries now meet the recommendations of the World Health Assembly whichcalled, in 1992, for the inclusion of hepatitis B immunisation in national vaccination programmes [1,2]. As of June 2001, the number of countries worldwide implement- ing a universal hepatitis B infant and/or adolescent vaccination programme had increased to 129, meaning that 50% of the global birthcohort was being immunised against hepatitis B in routine programmes. Currently (November 2004), 168 countries worldwideare implementing or planning to implement a universal hepatitis Bimmunisation programme for infants and/or adolescents. The results of effective implementation of universal hepatitis B programmes have become apparent in terms of reduction not onlyin incidence of acute hepatitis B infections, but also in the carrier ratein immunised cohorts, and in hepatitis B related mortality [3-8]. By the end of 2004, 43 of the 52 countries in the European Region of the World Health Organization (WHO) (representing 52 countries)will have implemented a universal HB immunisation programme [FIGURE]. In western Europe, most countries started with a universal infant/neonate or adolescent immunisation programme.Belgium (1999), Germany (1995), Italy (1991), (adoles-cents: 1994; neonates: 2000) and Spain (adolescents: 1993; neonates: 1998) have both universal programmes in place. These countries willbe able to end the adolescent programme when the first immunisedinfant/newborn cohort has reached the target age of the adolescentprogramme. This has already happened in Italy in 2004; all personsborn since 1979 have been targeted by either the infant or adolescentHB vaccination programme in the space of 12 years [9,10].FIGURE Type of universal hepatitis B vaccination programme in the European Region of the W orld Health Organization, 2004 (Source: N Emiroglu and A Lobanov, WHO Euro, Copenhagen, Denmark) At least universal infan t At least universal ne wborn Universal a dolescent No universal HepB immunisati onAt least uni versal infant At least uni versal newborn Universal adolescent No universal HepB immunisationThe increased availability of a safe and effective hepatitis B vaccine makes control and ultimate elimination of hepatitis B infection and associated diseases a real possibility. The next decade will be charac-terised by expanded use of hepatitis B vaccines, monovalent as well as combined, and increasing efforts to sustain vaccine programmes. However,a crucial element for all countries in reaching or failing to reach the 1997 WHO targets is the social and political commitment to preve nt hepatitis B in their future generations. Therefore, any realistic attempt to eliminate HBV will require reconsideration of earlier, less effective vaccination strategies and international cooperation on a global scale. Only by doing so will we come closer to the WHO goal and prevent millions of unnecessary deaths and suffering. References 1. World Health Organization.

Despite the apparent success in Sweden, the availability of nucleic acid amplification tests to facilitate screening, and the fact that chlamydia rates are increasing across the westernhemisphere [FIGURE] [4,5], European countries have been slow toimplement chlamydia screening. A national chlamydia screening programme, principally targeting sexually active women aged between 16 and 24 and attending selected healthcare settings is nowexpanding in England [6]. This article summarises the current status of chlamydia control activities in other selected European countries.Countries have been selected on the basis of having well known activities, recently published large studies, or personal communicationswith the author. Footnote to figure: Completeness, coverage, and sources of data collection vary between countries. Data sources are stable over time within countries. Comparisons between absolute rates cannot therefore be made but time trends can be compared. Sweden Opportunistic chlamydia screening of young women in a variety of healthcare settings was introduced in some Swedish counties inthe early 1980s [2]. Since 1988, the law has made it compulsory acrossthe country to provide free testing, treatment and contact tracing toany patient with suspected chlamydia, and to report diagnosed infections [2,7,8]. Screening is targeted at sexually active women aged15-29 years seeking contraception or abortion. Men are screenedwhen found through contact tracing or if symptomatic [2,8]. Y outhclinics have been established in many places to increase access to services for young people, including young men. However, there is nonational coordination of screening, and there are no mechanisms toensure that clinicians comply with the law [2]. The intensity of chlamy-dia control measures varies geographically because screening is organised locally. Some counties have produced guidelines about who and where to screen, and targets for reducing prevalence [9]; othersfollow the Swedish general recommendations and/or the NationalAction Plan for STI/HIV Prevention 2000-2005 [10,11]. National clinical notifications of chlamydia, which began in May 1988, show thatchlamydia rates increased in all counties between 1997 and 2003 [12]. In 2003 about 384 000 tests (25% male) were carried out [13], corre- sponding to about 13% of the population aged 15-39 years in Sweden. 68 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 10-12 Current status of chlamydia screening in Europe N Low Department of Social and Preventive Medicine.

Screening is routine in sexually transmitted infection clinics. In March 2004, the Gezondheidsraad (Health Council of the Netherlands) published advice stating that there was insufficient ev- idence to support a national screening programme for all men andwomen in a particular age group [14]. They recommended a 'more active prevention policy as a matter of urgency' while awaiting fur-ther research. This includes: more active case-finding, notably inthose with mild or non-specific symptoms; raising awareness inschools, primary care, and through information campaigns; andscreening in abortion and fertility clinics [14]. Three large studiesof opportunistic [15] and systematic screening using home-col-lected specimens have been carried out so far [16,17]. In popula-tion-based studies, about 40% of people invited to provide ahome-collected urine specimen for chlamydia testing have doneso, and over 90% accept the offer of an opportunistic test in primarycare. Opportunistic screening in primary care, offering a yearlychlamydia test to 15-24 year olds, has been shown to be cost-effec- tive [18]. DenmarkThere is currently no organised chlamydia screening programme in Denmark, and no national guidelines about target populations for screening. About 275 000 chlamydia tests were done in Denmark in2002, corresponding to 15% of the population aged 15-39 years.About 60% of tests are reported to be done for screening purposes [19]. The Danish National Board of Health has commissioned ahealth technology assessment to investigate the need for chlamydiascreening [20]. A commission to discuss this report is now being setup. Studies conducted as part of this assessment show that postalscreening of male and female high school students can reduce theincidence of chlamydia and pelvic inflammatory disease at one year[21], and that this form of screening is cost-effective, even withmodest uptake [20]. Other European countries There is no organised national chlamydia screening programme in Finland [22], Portugal (M-J Borrego, personal communication,2004) Austria (A Stary, personal communication, 2004), orSwitzerland (Low N, Sp\u00f6rri A, Zwahlen M. Unpublished report to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health). A recent review ofsurveillance and management of sexually transmitted infections inthe European Union and Norway identified no other organisedchlamydia control activities [23]. However, in Austria, registered prostitutes are regularly screened and screening of pregnant womenis also common. CommentThere are no systematic, register-based screening programmes for genital chlamydia in Europe, although this is the only interven-tion that has been shown to be effective in randomised controlledtrials [21,24]. Increasing chlamydia rates in Sweden, which is also oc- curring in European countries without widespread screening, sug-gests that the opportunistic approach adopted there has notcontrolled chlamydia transmission. Despite the legal framework, target populations, screening locat ions, screening intervals and mon- itoring criteria are not nationally defined. Partner notification isalso not universal, particularly in primary care [9], and men stillaccount for only a quarter of those tested. Screening coverage has de-clined since the early 1990s and is similar to that in Denmark, whichhas no organised chlamydia control activities. The NationalChlamydia Screening Programme in England is still expanding in dif-ferent regions. Success in controlling chlamydia transmission islikely to depend on achieving consistent and regular coverage oftesting and partner notification amongst both women and men in a range of settings, including primary care.Acknowledgement s Drs.

Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, Rome, Italy Published online 7 October 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/041007 .asp) In August 2004, the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service announced the introduction of a new five-combination vaccine, Pediacel, against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Hib in the infant vaccination schedule: 2, 3 and 4 months (DTaP/IPV/Hib).This replaces the diphtheria, tetanus, whole-cell pertussis, Hib vaccine (DTwP-Hib) and live oral polio vaccine given separately. The pertussis vaccine in the combined product introduced from September is acellular, and includes five Bordatella pertussis antigens (pertussis toxin, filamentous haemagglutanin, pertactin andfimbrial agglutinogens 2 and 3). The UK is the only European country currently licensing and introducing the five-component acel- lular pertussis vaccine for infant primary immunisation [TABLE]. A five-component acellular pertussis vaccine was initially studied in the mid-1990s in an extensive clinical trial in Sweden, which included more than 80 000 infants [1]. In that study, three acellularproducts were compared with a whole cell vaccine produced in UK.The efficacies of the whole cell vaccine and of the five- and three-component vaccines were found to be similar against culture-con- firmed pertussis with spasmodic cough lasting at least 21 days.The three-component vaccine had a slightly lower efficacy against mildpertussis. The issue of completely controlling pertussis is still unresolved, as in many countries with long histories of extended vaccination, aresurgence of the disease has been observed. In many countries, including the UK, children are now given pre-school boosters [2,3]. The introduction of booster vaccination for adolescents and adults is under consideration in some countries. Vaccination of older agegroups may reduce the pertussis reservoir, as parents may infect their children when they are too young to be immunised but at an age when pertussis may be more severe. According to EUV AC.NET, a European project which collects data on vaccine preventable diseases and vaccine coverage across Europe (http://www.ssi.dk/graphics/html/EUV AC/index.html ), a teenage pertussis booster is currently recommended in Austria, France,Germany and Malta, but no data are available about the actual coverage of this age group. Monitoring of pertussis and of pertussis vaccination is still a priority in EU where most childhood infections have been effectivelycontrolled.TABLE Table.

These at risk patients are asked: not to donate blood, organs or tissues, to inform their clinician if they need medical, surgical or dental treatment, so that infection control precautions (http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/acdp/tseguidance/) can be taken to reduce any possible risk of spreading vCJD, and toconsider informing their family, in case they (the patients) need emergency surgery in the future. The CJDIP has categorised each batch of implicated plasma prod- ucts according to the likelihood that special public health precau-tions need to be taken as follows: High :the amount of potential infectivity in product batches was high enough to warrant special public health precautionsfollowing the administration of a very small dose. These batchesshould be traced, and the recipients advised of their exposureand asked to take special public health precautions. Medium :substantial quantities of the material in question would need to have been administered to warrant special public health precautions. Efforts should be made to trace thesebatches and assess the additional risk to individual recipients todetermine if special precautions should be taken. Low :the potential additional risk to recipients is considered negligible. These batches do not need to be traced and the individual recipients do not need to be informed. This categorisation is based on very cautious assumptions, and the uncertainties underlying the assessment of 'risk' are great.The CJDIP guidance is to limit any possible iatrogenic human-to-human transmission of vCJD. It should NOT be interpreted as an es- timate of an individual patient's additional risk of developing vCJD,which is uncertain, and likely to be very low. The patients who may be affected include some patients with bleeding disorders, some patients with primary immunodeficiency(PID), and some patients with other conditions, who may include, forexample, patients with secondary immunodeficiencies, certain neurological and autoimmune conditions, plasma exchange recipientsand patients with severe burns, and with some other conditions requiring critical care. Patients in the UK who are 'at-risk' of vCJD for public health purposes are being contacted by their doctors and informed of the precautions they will need to take. The product manufacturers are providing details to individual countries to which parts of batches with a 'High' or 'Medium' likeli- hood that public health precautions might be required were exported.The UK Department of Health and the Health Protection Agency areproviding further details to authoritative bodies in these countries aswell as to the European Commission and WHO. The Health Protection Agency's (HPA) CJD section at the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre is coordinating the patient notification in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The ScottishCentre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) is coordi-nating this notification in Scotland.

To date, nine UK plasma donors are known to have developed vCJD. Collectively, they made 23 plasma donations. The donatedplasma was used to manufacture factor VIII, factor G, albumin, anti-D. The potential risk of vCJD infection following treatment with any implicated plasma products, on top of the risk from dietary exposureto the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent, is very uncertain. So far, there are no recorded instances of vCJD beingspread through surgery, nor have there been any cases among recipients of plasma products sourced from individuals who later developed vCJD. In December 2003, the death from vCJD of a person some years after receiving a blood transfusion from a donorwho had died of vCJD was announced [1]. In July 2004 a secondprobable case of transfusion-associated vCJD infection was identified[2]. These two events have increased concern about the potential infectivity of blood and plasma products. Public health precautions against vCJDThe CJDIP now recommends that certain special public health precautions need to be taken for some recipients of UK sourcedplasma products that were manufactured using donations from individuals who subsequently developed vCJD. This is in order toreduce any possible risk of iatrogenic transmission of vCJD. The CJDIP has used a vCJD blood risk assessment (http://www.dnv.com/consulting/news_consulting/RiskofInfectionfro mvariantCJDinBlood.asp ), together with information on how the particular batches of plasma products were manufactured, to assessthe potential levels of infection that patients were exposed to.
