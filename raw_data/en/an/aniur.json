The culprit is a bacterium called leptospirosis, a familiar name to Appaloosa owners everywhere as it can cause recurrent uveitis (an eye disease) as well as acute renal (kidney) failure and abortions. All mammals are susceptible to the bacteria but some more than others. So, you ask, what's the chances of catching something from these dead or sick sea lions? The answer is a bit complicated. First, there's more than one of these Lepto guys. It Comes in Several Flavors Leptospira interrogates has several different [serovars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype) (distinct variations within a species of bacteria or virus): - grippotyphosa (skunks, voles, muskrats, skunks) - icterohemorrhagiae (rats) - canicola (dogs) - bratislava (pigs, possibly mice, horses) We can be either maintenance hosts for these lovelies or an incidental host. Don't you just love medical terminology? One sounds like your mother in law is moving in forever and the other sounds like your best friends stopped by unexpectedly for an evening of fun. Unfortunately, the incidental host is the poor bugger that contracts the disease and gets really sick and possibly dies. The maintenance host gets a little sick but then harbors the bacteria and continues to contaminate the environment. Guess which one the sea lions are? I've put the maintenance hosts in parenthesis in the list above, so you can see how wide-ranging the susceptible species are \u2014 and the impossibility of keeping the bacteria out of your realm of existence. What do the Sea Lions have? The sea lions, according to [marine mammal researcher Jim Rice](https://mmi.oregonstate.edu/people/jim-rice) at OSU's Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, are infected with the pomona serovar. One of the difficulties in diagnosing which Lepto serovar is causing all the heartache is that they commonly cross-react so you might get a positive result for hardjo but pomona is really the culprit. Ok, I can feel your eyes beginning to glaze over, I know mine are. How Can Horses Catch This? The take-home message is that the serovars that are most commonly implicated in causing disease in horses are pomona and grippotyphosa, but they are a maintenance host for bratislava. This means horses are at risk from these sea lions, but the story is a bit more complicated. How do animals contract this you ask? Contact with urine from an infected individual (or fetal fluids and tissue \u2014 but you don't typically run into this on a trail ride). It can be picked up through ingestion or broken skin. If you come across a sick or dead sea lion on the beach you probably can't get your horse near it to begin with, so just cross behind it on the beach and avoid any contaminated sand. In fact, your horse is more in danger of being attacked by a sick sea lion, than contracting lepto from it by walking on the beach near the sick animal. If you take your dog to the beach it's more problematic. You probably can't keep your dog away from it. That's why officials are making warnings specifically for dogs. I love dogs, but they can be disgusting and will readily go over and lick up contaminated fluids. Or pretend they can take down an angry 600-pound sea creature. Chihuahua owners are you listening? The good news is that this bacterium is a little fragile and doesn't like sunshine or temperatures above 93\u00b0F or below 50\u00b0F in the soil. It also needs moisture, so this isn't like Pigeon Fever which is tougher than a boiled owl. Treatment is antibiotics and supportive care if the kidneys are affected. Recurrent uveitis is typically managed with anti-inflammatories as antibiotics have not proven to be effective in treating uveitis. The Vaccines There is finally a vaccine on the market for Lepto for use in the horse (no more cow vaccines). It is a killed vaccine of the serovar pomona and requires an initial vaccination with a booster in 3-4 weeks. Vaccination thereafter is annual. It is safe in foals over 6 months of age and in pregnant broodmares after the second trimester. I think the most appropriate use of this vaccine is among our Appaloosa friends who are so prone to uveitis. Newer dog vaccines contain the pomona serovar as well, for our overly curious friends. The Bottom Line The short version of all this \u2014 if you go to the beach with your pets, make sure your dogs are vaccinated for Leptospirosis, and give sea lions and any other marine mammals you see a wide berth \u2014 living or not. Keep your dogs away from all marine mammals - that may mean keeping them on a leash. Remember, [marine mammals are federally protected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Mammal_Protection_Act), and you could face a big fat fine if your dog harasses a sick animal. That's probably a bigger risk than actually contracting the disease from a ride on the beach. If you're just with your horse, you should be fine simply keeping an eye out and staying a safe distance away. "}
