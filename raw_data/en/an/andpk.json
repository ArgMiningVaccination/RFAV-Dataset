However, I am acutely aware that these public buildings are actually owned by the public. They were bought or leased with monies from public taxation and are maintained from that same source of funding. I therefore have a very clear duty in relation to the public police estate. 1. To ensure that the police service estate is fit for purpose enabl ing operational policing to be delivered across the length and breadth of Cornwall, Devon and the Isles of Scilly. 2. To minimise the cost and footprint of the estate whilst ensuring that objective 1 is properly delivered. 3. To seek the maximum financial bene fit from the disposal or re -use of any surplus estate. To ensure the achievement of the above objectives I, in conjunction with the Chief Constable, intend to pursue a continued rationalisation of the estate coupled with a new innovative approach to maxi mising income from surplus property. For too long, we have allowed private companies to benefit from the profit of developing public land. I intend to bring that benefit back into public hands for the benefit of improved policing. Over the next year, my of fice will establish a commercial arm that will develop out surplus sites for increased capital receipt through sale or create an income stream through rent or leasing. PCCs were created to bring new ideas to the policing arena and I am delighted to be one of the first to take this step in ensuring value for the public of Cornwall, Devon and the Isles of Scilly. Estates Strategy 2015 - 21 (Final draft vs. 1.7 - 15 July 2015 ) Foreword by Shaun Sawyer, Chief Constable for Devon and Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly As Chief Constable I welcome from the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) this Estates Strategy. I very much support the PCC in exploring, through this strategy, opportunities to bring innovation into estate strategy and the development of the estate over the next five years. The provision of a sustainable and resilient modern policing estate, based within communities working with partners, is essential for the delivery of the Police and Crime Plan and our wider public service. It is one of the core enablers to delivering our force Mission, 'T o detect and prevent harm, protect the vulnerable and reduce crime'. This estate strategy continues our transition from an ageing estate to a more modernised and rationalised estate, fit for the 21st century. The estate strategy reflects the changing patt erns of crime and vulnerability, particularly on line crime and investigation, as well as considering different ways of working including working remotely or co -located with partners. It seeks to strike the right balance between rationalisation and ensurin g that our staff, who work within an increasingly pressurised environment, work within buildings that are fit for purpose and which do not add to those pressures. The estate strategy focuses our endeavours in providing best value to the public directly as a force and via sharing arrangements with partners. Estates Strategy 2015 - 21 (Final draft vs. 1.7 - 15 July 2015 ) Executive Summary The Estate Strategy sets out how the organisations building portfolio will support the delivery of the Police and Crime Plan and i t explains how the estate will assist the Force in achieving its mission to detect and prevent harm; protect the vulnerable and reduce crime. The Police and Crime Commissioners estate supports the operations of some 5,800 officers and staff across 110,0 00m2 of space. The rationalisation programme which underpins the strategy is part of the response to the prevailing economic situation whereby the property portfolio must become more efficient than it has ever been before. The estate will therefore suppor t the core objectives within the Police and Crime Plan, to be efficient and provide long term security, whilst ensuring that the service which operates from it is well placed to provide high quality, accessible help for the victims of crime. The estate wil l therefore: be in the right place and in the right condition be flexible and sustainable now and in the future be able to deliver value for money in terms of service benefit and operating costs The organisation will deliver estate based strategic objectives that will reduce running costs and the overall size of the estate, whilst maintaining a property portfolio which is fit - for-purpose and designed to support modern policing. This forward thin king strategy will see the organisations property portfolio respond to the future transformation that new technology will bring, whilst exploring new initiatives that include greater commercialisation of the estate.

Introduction 1.1 Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Plan has the strategic intention to cut crime, keep people safe and encourage everyone to work together to make communities stronger and safer. The Force mission makes the commitment to detect and prevent harm; protect the vulnerable and reduce crime. I n support of these corporate objectives, the police estate must actively support new way s of providing policing services and in a time of economic challenge it must achieve th at at minimal cost . 1.2 In these times of significant change, t he Force needs to create a healthy environment for a diverse and flexible workforce that has the right skills and knowledge to deliver an excellent service. The police estate will positively contribute to service delivery and enhance the organisational culture through its premises . It will enable and encourage a healthy organisation. 1.3 The Estate Strategy will provide a flexible capability to meet new operational and support requirements ranging from strategic hubs to local community bases. In line with the intentions of the Police and Crime Plan, o pportunities to develop shared facilities with other local service providers will be actively sought. The Estate Strategy will include options to rent / lease appropriate premises. Full consideration will be given to health and safety, equality and diversity impact and overall value for money requirements in the design of new premises. 1.4 The Estate Strateg y will be aligned to the core o perational requirements necessary to achieve organisational aims . It will have a positive impact on service delivery, customer satisfaction, employee retention, business processes and the promotion of our core values. 1.5 The estate will: Support the delivery of the Police and Crime Plan Support the delivery of the Force Mission Integrate and align operational sites to preferred locations chosen for operational need Provide premises that add to staff morale and effectiveness Support police officers working together as one team by providing appropriate open plan accommodation Embed the themes of equality and diversity in the development of the estate Ensure new a nd existing buildings support the sustainability agenda Ensure estate running costs are minimise d to release funds and reduce the overall footprint of the portfolio to achieve this Prioritise investment in the estate & demonstrate value for money Supp ort effective public access points at the most appropriate locations across the Force Ensure the estate is accessible to our customers and staff , including locations that do not house public enquiry office s Estates Strategy 2015 - 21 (Final draft vs. 1.7 - 15 July 2015 ) Develop a revenue income stream to support front line services through the effective estate utilisation 1.6 To shape the operational estate for the future , ongoing consideration will be given to: Collaboration and co -location with public and p rivate sector partners Public expectations and requirements The economic and employment impact of the location of police buildings The rapid pace of technological change including the introduction and development of mobile data, communication technologies and digital storage of information 1.7 The estate rationalisation programme of 2011 - 2015 reduced the size of the property portfolio by 7.8% and running costs by \u00a3640,000 per annum. The Police and Crime Commissioner believe s that the good work undertaken to date on estate rationalisation now needs to be expanded with a second , more challenging, phase of rationalisation being progressed. The comb ination of increased budget pres sures and reducing staff numbers requires a funda mental review of the police estate with a view to achieving ongoing cost reductions , the release of surplus v alue and the enabling of a fit for purpose police estate for the first half of the 21st century. 1.8 An additi onal benefit of vacating surplus p roperties is the opportunity for the Police and Crime Commissioner to explore commercialisation opportunities around the obsolete estate, with the intention of maximising the disposal receipt or income generation, whichever is most appropriate. 2 The Estate 2.1 The Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner has 1 31 buildings within its portfolio , located over 1 03 sites; in space terms it equates to a gross internal area of approximately 110,000m2. The average building age is 4 5 years . The total book value is \u00a31 26 million , while debt stands at around \u00a3 31 million. Across the portfolio 77% of the properties are freehold and 23% leasehold. The largest 21 sites (including headquarters) make up 70% of the portfolio. The estate currently accommodates 5,143 employees and 639 Special Constables. 2.2 The estate suffers from a unique set of difficulties due to its age and geography. Of particular issue is Custody where out dated accommodation can provide significant risk . 2.3 Many properties are in the wrong location and many more are of the wrong size and configuration and do not, or cannot, carry out the required function. Many sites have poor visibility and have limited accessibility . 2.4 Against a backdrop of reduced funding, d ecisions have been made to significantly reduce the operating cost of the portfolio to protect front line officer numbers. To maintain a high level of service t he organisation will continue to make relevant changes to the operational policing model . These changes in service delivery will continue to highlight the inadequacies of many of the aging buildings and this provides the opportunity to take stock and initiate some sweeping changes across the estate. 2.5 A proactive programme of change is req uired . A reconfiguration of the estate within the financial constraints imposed on the organisation is necessary . The aim of the Estate Strategy is to make the estate fit -for-purpose and flexible to future demands, whilst at the same time reduc ing the over all portfolio size. Estates Strategy 2015 - 21 (Final draft vs. 1.7 - 15 July 2015 ) 2.6 Within the next six years the organisation will continue to reduce the number of sites from which it operates. Where clear benefits exist, further opportunities will be progressed with partner organisations to achieve greater efficiencies than that which could be achieved alone. 2.7 The Police and Crime Commissioner will explore creative o pportunities for obsolete police sites, with the intention of maximising disposal receipts or generat ing revenue income to support front line services through greater commercialisation of the estate. Devonport Police Station , 2014 3 The Strategy 3.1 The 2011 - 2015 Estate Strategy was highly effective in directing the delivery of estate based strategic objectives. The past 4 years have seen the delivery of 42 rationalisation projects, which have resulted in portfolio footprint that is 7.8% smaller than in 2011 . The portfolio is mor e efficient and effective than it has been fo r many years , but significant opportunities still remain. 3.2 The 2015 - 2021 Estate Strategy will build on the firm foundations that its predecessor provided , however, it will be more radical in its approach to the transformation and future use. 3.3 The Estate Strategy will support the organisation in the delivery of a sustainable and resilient high quality service, by achieving the correct b alance of well placed neighbourhood facilities , located at the centre of communities , and strategic operational hubs located on arterial link roads to aid specialist units and response policing. 3.4 This Estate S trategy has been reviewed and updated in the light of an ongoing reduction in funding and ongoing organisational change , to adapt to a new way of working . It is fully aligned with the Police and Crime Commissioners objective of achieving efficient and long-term financial security. 3.5 The Estate Strategy will address the issues of a 'one team cultu re' through wider use of open plan offices. It will help to encourage the intention to work together as one team to Estates Strategy 2015 - 21 (Final draft vs. 1.7 - 15 July 2015 ) safeguard communities and neighbourhoods. This type of environment will aid internal communications between staff and departments, and also provide a degree of flexibility and hot -desking to help future -proof the organisation. 3.6 The Estate Strategy elements are corporate, strategic and flexible . As projects are proposed and developed the elements should be regarded as a benchmark and any deviation from them should be justified in the business case . 3.5 The Estate S trategy is derived from the Force vision and a desire to improve the overall composition of our existing estate. Business cases for investment will focus on the delivery of benefits as well as rectifying estate deficiencies. 3.6 In the current financial climate all business cases for new premises must look to reduce the size of the portfolio and the future financial cost of the estate. Any business case which does not achieve those objectives must provide a clear explanation why such efficiencies cannot be found. National Police Air Support Base , 2014 - Exeter International Airport 4 Strategy statements 4.1 Future -proofing The requirement to reduce budgets by \u00a339 million, is likely to result in a significant reduction is staff numbers over the next five years. Whilst it is difficult to be precise about where these reductions will be distributed it is important to take them i nto account when planning the estate for the future. When benchmarked against other Forces, t he Devon and Cornwall Police Estate is already above the national average in terms of size and these further staff reductions will magnify that inefficiency. Whilst it is acknowledged that some of the core sites are tight in terms of available space , it is essential that the future programme of work aims to reduce any over supply of space across the Force to more efficient levels. Estates Strategy 2015 - 21 (Final draft vs. 1.7 - 15 July 2015 ) All projects will need to consider individual operational requirements against wider organisational need . It is quite possible that one new site may have to replace a number of existing, if efficiencies are to be achieved. 4.2 Funding and Procurement Capital funding for the estate is approved by the Police and Crime Commissioner as the strategy is implemented. Whilst a three year medium term programme is agreed, a rolling 6 year financial commitment will be maintained taking into account mixed sources of funding such as borrowing, capital grants, joint ventures, partnering and commercial investment. However, the delivery of the programme will remain partly depend ent upon the funding generated through the disposal of the existing portfolio. Private developer schemes and other vehicles for sharing risk, cost and equity with other agencies will be encouraged to accelerate the pace of change. PFIs / PPPs are not considered an appropriate delivery mechanism, unless it forms part of a significantly strategic multi -agency scheme. The Buildings and Estate Department work closely with the South West Police Procurement Department to ensure goods and services are provided in the most cost effective way, in accordance with procurement legislation and the P olice an d Crime Commissioners Scheme of Governance. 4.3 Ownership and Tenure A freehold site for large dedicated operational / organisational facilities is the preferred ownership model to minimise the revenue impact of the estate . Commercial leases should be avoided whe re possible , and when opportunity allows existing commercial leases should be rationalise d from the estate. Leasehold premises , preferably in partnership buildings, will be used for short to medium - term requirem ents; examples being neighbourhood team bases / community bases . Flexible leases / licences are the preferred model for public sector partnering initiatives unless it is considered a strategic facility where a joint ownership model may be considered . 4.4 Development Opportunities and Income Generation Active management of the estate supports the delivery of an efficient and effective police service. The acquisition of strategic sites , when they become available , remains important and the risk / investment decision associated with that must be considered on a project by project basis. Maximising the asset value of obsolete police sites is a priority. Alternative use p lanning consent s and site improvement work will be undertaken, where appropr iate, to attract private investors and optimise returns. The Police Crime Commissioner will explore the opportunity of retaining some of the obsolete estate to generate income . A development appraisal will be undertaken of each redundant site and a deci sion made as to whether the site should be sold to achieve a capital receipt , developed out and then sold to maximise the receipt or retained in the interest of generat ing rental income to support front line services . Estates Strategy 2015 - 21 (Final draft vs. 1.7 - 15 July 2015 ) 4.5 Partnership Opportunities and \"One Public Estate\" The Force s upports the general principles of the Governments \"One Public Estate\" programme and looks to continue to work with public sector partners to achieve the efficiencies that can be achieved through the delivery of joint venture schemes. However, physical co -location with other agencies will only be pursued where a scheme demonstrates that its delivery leads to a more efficient and effective police service. These principles will apply whether the opportun ity is initiated by the Police or at the invitation of others. All new concepts or projects will be considered within the context of longer -term organisational aspirations. This is to ensure that the Estate Strategy is progressed through the optimisation of corporate priorities. All long term acquisitions and freehold disposals will be formally approved by the Executive Board and the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner. Where arrangements are made to share pr emises with partners, clear legal a greements will be put in place to ensure the collocation remain s sustainable. Hayle, Tri -partite Emergency Services Base in construction , 2015 4.6 Rationalisation At a time of ongoing reductions in public sector funding and organisational contraction , the property portfolio must react positively to meet the challenge posed. There are opportunities to continue to modernise the estate, making it more fit for purpose whilst at the same time reducing its overall size and cost. This has been evi denced in the successful delivery of the 2011 - 2015 strategy which outperformed all targets set. However , a more radical approach is now required, to meet the ever increasing financial challenge. It will be necessary to close a number of Police Station s / Police Offices and to operate the teams who police those communities from either the next nearest station to that which is being closed , or a much smaller community base . Each buildings potential outcome will be the subject of a business case which wil l consider the potential impact on both operational service delivery and the community which the facility serves. Estates Strategy 2015 - 21 (Final draft vs. 1.7 - 15 July 2015 ) A full property health check has been undertaken , in addition to an assessment of the following parameters: Estimated travelling time (normal driving conditions) from building to the next police facility of any significance Number of officers / staff operating from each facility Operational demand The property Health check and the above parameters were employed to develop a six year rationalisation programme, which underpins the strategy. These changes in portfolio size will actively achieve the following reductions : A reduction in portfolio footprint of 12% by the end of 2020 / 2021 A reduction in running costs of the estate of \u00a30.9mi illion pa by 2020 / 2021 [Full Rationalisation Programme - Appendix A] Truro Police Station, demolition of Tregolls Road 2015 4.7 Communication and Consultation A proactive communications strategy will underpin the Estate Strategy to enable maximum support from all stakeholders. This will include internal and external communications and will involve proactive marketing of the benefits of each scheme. Key stakeholders are to be identified in the early stages, especially wher e communication involves the wider general public. This is to ensure that changes to the estate, especially development opportunities, are considered in terms of their positive impact and customer focus opportunities. Consultation is an important element of the communications strategy. Each new project requires a consultation plan including impact assessments. Consultation will be two -way to manage public expectation. Estates Strategy 2015 - 21 (Final draft vs. 1.7 - 15 July 2015 ) 4.8 Continuity Major building projects extend over many years. Clear user requiremen ts are necessary to ensure corporate standards and continuity exists in the delivery of the Estate Strategy. On larger investments, it is desirable wherever possible to seek to ensure that key personnel, including project executives, are not subject to change during the life of the project . 4.9 Facilities When designing new build accommodation, clear criteria will be incorporated into the design of the estate including consistent space standards in office / lockers rooms. The estate rationalisation programme will result in the delivery of further Neighbourhood Team Bases and Community Bases . Operational, Health and Safety, Information and Assurance and Equality Impact Assessments are undertaken prior to the delivery of a Neighbourhoo d Team or Community Base being agreed. . . A Neighbourhood Team Base will provide: A locker room for the Neighbourhood Team (sometimes a shared space with partners) Access to welfare facilities including a toilet, a shower and a meals room / food preparation area (often shared space with partners) A small quiet room / informal interview space (sometimes a shared space with partners) An office (sized dependent on use) that has IT provision enabling access to the Force network which is generally a sec ure area for exclusive police use A designated car parking space for an operational vehicle (sometimes two) Where possible, t hese facilities will be co -located in a public sector partnership building. The Neighbourhood Team will deploy from the base. A Community Base ; is much smaller in size and it will provide: A small office , that may have IT provision enabling access to the Force network. This space will have exclusive possession where possible, but sometimes it will be located in open plan when co-located with other public sector partners. Access to toilet facilities and a kitchenette area A car parking space for an operational vehicle will be provided where possible, but that is not always achievable depending upon the options available. Where possible, these facilities will be co -located in a public sector partnership building. They are designed to be a \"drop in facility\" and as such locker, shower and a quiet room are not provided because it is not expected that the officers will use th is as their main base. Neighbourhood Team and Community Bases present a change that will in some instances challenge the traditional view of rest areas. In these smaller facilities, seating in the work area can be utilised as appropriate. Where mo re traditional welfare facilities are required, officers and staff will be expected to utilise those provided at the nearest \"main station\". Staff car parking cannot be guaranteed on any site. Whilst reasonable endeavours are employed to provide some leve l of staff car parking, it is not always possible to achieve. It should be noted, that the organisation is not obligated to provide staff c ar parking. Estates Strategy 2015 - 21 (Final draft vs. 1.7 - 15 July 2015 ) The force is intending to increase the numbers and geographic coverage of Special Constables. At a time when the estate is being reduced, it will be necessary to explore what opportunities may be available to safely and securely store kit at their home locations, subject to their consent. Whilst it is acknowledged that consideration will need to be given to the risk management around the same, if a successful pilot was to be taken forward it is possible that it might become an option for selected regular officers in the future. Truro Police Station replacement, Castle Street 2014 4.10 Maintenance All buildings will require responsive, planned and / or cyclical maintenance. Backlog repairs, which are currently estimated at \u00a315 million, remain a significant challenge to the organisation . The difficu lt financial situation has seen t he Force make some difficult decisions, including a sizeable reduc tion in its investment in building maintenance. Maintenance investment will be prioritised where possible to buildings that are not on the rationalisation programme but identified as facilities that the organisation will retain. There will remain an ongoing commitment to improve the standard of accommodation in those buildings in the interest of providing good quality working environments. Defects in any building that are a health and safety concern will continue to be prioritised. The maintenance backlog will be reduced on a gradual basis as the portfolio decreases in size and facilities are close d that have minimal operational benefit but significant outstanding repair liabilities . 4.11 Equality and Accessibility Where buildings are open to the public they will be well located, accessible to all members of the community and compliant with all current statutory requirements. The infrastructure that supports modern information and communication technologies will be sufficiently adaptable to enable future change. Estates Strategy 2015 - 21 (Final draft vs. 1.7 - 15 July 2015 ) Future regeneration of the estate will look to improve the performance of buildings by delivering positive equality outcomes. Assessment of performance will be undertaken in areas of risk to identify gaps in the running and operation of facilities (e.g. physical barriers which need removal) and proactive action plans to resolve the problems identified will be implement ed. Equality Impact and Health and Safety Assessments will be undertaken for all major projects. 4.12 Space Utilisation Open plan offices will be the standard in a ll building s for all staff . A specific business case will be required to justify any request for dedicated offices, which will be provided to address a clear and justifiable business need. Adequate qui et room and meeting room provision will be made. The following space standards will be employed on al l projects: Type Area Sq Mt Storage Sq Mt Function General open plan 5.25 0.75 General office based staff As above + special requirements 6.5 1.25 Team leader, specialist Touchdown position 4.0 None Operational & visiting staff Senior manager 16 1.5 Departmental Head A hot desk environment in office locations should be employed wherever possible. T he ratio of desks to the number of permanent staff members should be in the order of 80% (8 workstations for 10 people FTE). Response and Neighbourhood Office s should be provided with only 1 workstation per 3 people as a maximum provision, although the requirement is likely to be less in many buildings . Teignmouth Police Station, m ain office - open plan Estates Strategy 2015 - 21 (Final draft vs. 1.7 - 15 July 2015 ) 4.13 Security Appropriate security measures will be implemented at all sites, buildings and rooms, with key consideration being given to access control . Physical security will be incorporated into all new building works to meet agreed standards , including the installation of the Force Access to Buildings System, Axiom. 4.14 Sustainability and the Environment Sustainability and environmental considerations are important elements of the strategy. These are con tained within planning consents an d are key points of interest when consulting the public over changes to the estate. These requirements will be considered under three headings: Environment Energy efficiency Waste and recycling Water and utilities Travel to work (Green Travel Plan) Car parking Economy Partnerships with public / private sector providers and support of local small / medium enterprises Community Community impact - which will take into consideration the impact on the local community of the facility in construction and th en in use. Every effort will be made to reduce negative impacts on residents where possible Devon and Cornwall Police is committed to reducing its Carbon Footprint . Between 2009 and 2014 the Force reduced its production by 1,800 tCO2 which equates to approximately 19.5%, measured against a target for the period of 20%. The organisation al objective is to reduce carbon by a further 15% by 202 1 and a carbon management plan will be produced to facilitate the same . All new buildings will be constructed to the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Model (BREEAM) \" Very Good \" as standard with \" Excellent \" being an aspiration. 4.15 Information Communication Technology ICT transformation is integral to the future provision of the estate. Recent advancements in new technology have already resulted in significant changes in the way that some of the organisation use the estate. These advancements will continue to acc elerate and future change will transform the way that the whole organisation interacts with its buildings, more than ever before. Access to IT will become more flexible. Increased mobility, which will be enhanced by ubiquitous mobile (3/4G) coverage and planned enterprise -wide wifi capability, will remove the need for cabling and hardware in some buildings. The organisation will adopt converged technology which will bring telephone and IT services, not a specific location, but to wherever a person choose s to sit. This technology will support flexible -working and hot-desking within the estate, which will reduce the level of demand for office space that we see today. Estates Strategy 2015 - 21 (Final draft vs. 1.7 - 15 July 2015 ) Whilst agile working will increase, it is accepted that a core of traditional desktop PC's will still be required in locations where (i) they are needed for fixed roles or (ii) we need to provide a basic IT access provision at low cost. A regional IT network will be developed to allow the forces easier access to each other's information via a single -force logon and this will further enhance the ability for the organisation to be flexible around a person's place of work, on any particular day. Early on, the priority will be to progress this capability within the Strategic Alliance. The provisio n of new buildings is often a long term investment which does not always align itself with the pace of change that ICT transformation can bring. Therefore, the delivery of the Estate Strategy will be progressed with a full understanding of the independenci es between these business areas to ensure that where possible, a maximisation of future benefits will be achieved.
