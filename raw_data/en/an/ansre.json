TO ACHIEVE THIS WE MUST FIRST determine what THE obstacles to cure ARE? TRAUMAS, TOXICITIES, FAMILY INHERITED PATTERNS (MIASMS) &/or DEFICIENCIES ARE KEY - UNDERSTANDING HOW ONE SEQUENCES THE UNRAVELLING OF THESE THREADS IS THE ART OF PRESCRIBING. Any block to the healthy flow of the system will impact the body's vital resources and ultimately create an imbalance in the organs and their accompanying systems. As the toxicity, trauma, deficiency and miasm is addressed it will often need to be underpinned by a method referred to as ORGANOTHERAPY or ORGAN SUPPORT. PRESCRIBING ORGANOTHERAPY Rather than the whole-person symptom-similarity of Constitutional Classical prescribing, in Organopathy the focus is the imbalanced, dysfunctional or diseased organ itself. Depending on the level of health of the individual, the extent of imbalance or indeed pathology of the organ, either herbal mother tinctures or low potency homeopathic remedies are used. Where there is the need to drain the organ, where an individual is very unwell or presents with low vitality - herbal mother tinctures may be advised. Potentised homeopathic preparations ranging from 1X to 6X in dilution are used to drain, detox and strengthen. To find out more about homeopathic potency you can [read my blog post here](https://www.formandheal.com/blog/2021/3/16/depth-over-strength). MOTHER TINCTURE: 5 drops in a little water 3 times a day. Considered predominantly for drainage and support Pathology is advanced Vitality is low HOMEOPATHIC REMEDY: 1X to 6X either 1 to 2 times daily (not 1D to 12D in Europe) Taken over a longer period usually between 2 to 3 months. Considered for drainage with more emphasis on detoxing. Select one remedy and determine the one potency when self-prescribing. WHAT CAN BE TREATED? A Homeopath will determine which organ or body system is in most need of support within the context of why an individual has sought treatment. This may be obvious for instance urinary tract infections requiring kidney support however many conditions are less discernible for instance hormonal imbalance requiring liver drainage and detox. Organ Support can be applied to any body system and organ, we have remedies that will cover everything from the spleen to thymus, lungs to pancreas, lymphatic system to adrenals. There many texts available on Organotherapy however for those new to this methodology, I have decided to discuss probably the organ most commonly in need of support and never more so than in our toxic times - THE LIVER. THE LIVER The liver is an extraordinary organ, the veritable powerhouse of the body WHICH CARRIES out over five-hundred ESSENTIAL functions at any one time. The effects of an \"unhappy\" liver are far reaching and often unsuspected, some indications for liver imbalance are: digestive conditions from IBS to more serious pathologies candida overgrowth a susceptibility to mould chronic catarrh skin disorders including eczema, rashes, hives histamine overactivity and imbalance headaches and migraines musculoskeletal pain and discomfort lax connective tissues the tendency to strains and injury aching joints hormonal imbalances menstrual issues cysts anywhere in the body ALL TYPES OF eye AILMENTS AILMENTS OF THE SPLEEN, PANCREAS, GALLBLADDER, STOMACH AND INTESTINES TOXICITY - HEAVY METAL, CHEMICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL or AS A RESULT from drugs KEY LIVER FUNCTION INCLUDES: synthesis of cholesterol vital for production of all of the body's hormones production of bile which digests fats and eliminates toxins cleansing the blood which in turn nourishes the entire body resistance to and destruction of infections including bacterial neutralising and clearing the blood of drugs and toxins processing and absorbing of nutrients including vitamins A, D, E, K the converting of food into energy the regulation of blood clotting factors production of the enzymes required to repair damaged tissues BENEFITS OF ORGAN SUPPORT FOR THE LIVER: strengthens a weakened, congested and sluggish liver stimulates the liver to remove accumulated toxins increases the production of bile eliminates the tendency towards problematic bile stones increased vitality and immunity improvement in the digestive, immune, hormonal, circulatory systems improvement in symptoms ranging from headaches to eye ailments, musculoskeletal pains to brain fog LIVER SUPPORTIVE REMEDies Listed below are keynotes of a selection of liver supportive and drainage remedies used most often in my practice. This is by no means an exhaustive list however with enough detail to help you to differentiate between remedies.
