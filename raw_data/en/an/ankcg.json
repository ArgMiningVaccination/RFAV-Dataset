The atmosphere falls somewhere between a doctor's office and a day spanot too clinical, not too chic. Simple, antique-looking furniture and Eastern-influenced pictures, tapestries, and linens make up the d\u00e9cor. The center specializes in acupuncture, Reiki, and shamanic healing, an intense form of energy work that helps cleanse the body of negative or heavy energy caused by trauma or past experiences. (Shamanic healing combined with acupuncture is a popular and often successful treatment for infertility patients, too.) The extensive menu also includes massage, chiropractic care, meditation, and nutrition counseling. Because of the wide array of offerings, Satori is a good place for anyone looking for an alternative-medicine solution to a health problem, be it physical, mental, or spiritual; the practitioners on staff often work together to find the best program for each client. Although those just looking to relax will benefit from simple massage therapy and acupuncture sessions, most clients come here looking for answers to very specific health issues. "}
