I'm glad I bought it !\" - Heather Ingredients - Blessed Thistle herb (Cnicus benedictus) : Blessed thistle contains bitter compounds that support the production of both saliva and gastric acid, which both aid digestion. It is also used as an herbal galactagogue, which increases the flow of breast milk. - Chaste Tree berry (Vitex angus-castus) : Chaste Tree berry has been well studied in clinical trials to support normal hormone levels, particularly progesterone. It is most commonly used for menstrual support, premenstrual syndrome, and menopause. - False Unicorn root (Chamaelirium luteum) : This herb is prized by herbalists to balance hormones and enhance uterine health. It may provide support and comfort during menstruation, as well as encourage and on-time labor and delivery. False Unicorn root has a normalizing effect on the ovaries and may support healthy fluid balance in late-term pregnancy. - Ginger root (Zingiber officinale) : Ginger is loaded with nutrients and bioactive compounds that have powerful health benefits, including digestive support, inflammation and antioxidant support, cardiovascular support, and overall healthy cell support. - Licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra) : Licorice root is considered one of the world's oldest herbal remedies. The primary active compound is glycyrrhizin, which is responsible for the root's sweet taste, as well as its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. It may support upper respiratory and digestive health. - Partridge Berry herb (Mitchell repens) : This herb is most often used as a tonic for all of the organs of female reproduction. It helps to support a normal blood flow during menstruation and childbirth, tones the uterus helping it to maintain its proper function, and encourages swift labor and delivery. - Sarsaparilla root (Smilax medica) Dosage Suggested Use: Women: take 1/4 teaspoon 1-3 times daily. If taking with T&C Formula: we suggest starting H B Formula the day your cycle starts and take it for 2 weeks. Then switch to T&C Formula for 2 weeks. From that point simply continue to alternate the two formulas every two weeks regardless of when your cycle starts and stops. Trying using both for 3-6 months for best results. If taking with Progesterone Cream: On rare occasion we do have customers who want to also use Progesterone Cream. In this case, we suggest starting Progesterone Cream and T&C Formula on day 12 of your cycle (the day your cycle starts is day 1). Use Progesterone Cream and T&C Formula for 2 weeks, then switch to HB Formula for 2 weeks. Continue to alternate the products every 2 weeks (using T&C Formula and Progesterone Cream at the same time) for 3-6 months for best results. CAUTION: Do not use if pregnant.
