Introduction KanCare is a managed care Medicaid program which serves the State of Kansas through a coordinated approach. The State determined that contracting with multiple managed car e organizations will result in the provision of efficient and effective health care services to the populations covered by the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in Kansas and will ensure coordination of care and integration of physical and behavioral health services with each other and with home and community - based services. On August 6, 2012, the State of Kansas submitted a Medicaid Section 1115 demonstration proposal, entitled KanCare. That request was approved by the Centers for Me dicare and Medicaid Services on December 27, 2012, effective from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2017. The State submitted a one-year temporary extension request of this demonstration to CMS on July 31, 2017. The temporary extension was approved on October 13, 2017 . On December 20, 2017, the State submitted an extension request for its Medicaid 1115 demonstration. On December 18, 2018 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a renewal of the Medicaid Section 1115 demonstration proposal entitled KanCare . The demonstration is effective from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2023. KanCare is operating concurrently with the state's section 1915(c) Home and Community -Based Services (HCBS) waivers, which together provide the authority nec essary for the state to require enrollment of almost all Medicaid beneficiaries (including the aged, disabled, and some dual eligibles) across the state into a managed care delivery system to receive state plan and waiver services. This represents an expan sion of the state's previous managed care program, which provided services to children, pregnant women, and parents in the state's Medicaid program, as well as carved out managed care entities that separately covered mental health and substance use disorde r services. KanCare also includes a safety net care pool to support certain hospitals that incur uncompensated care costs for Medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured, and to provide incentives to hospitals for programs that result in delivery system refor ms that enhance access to health care and improve the quality of care. This five -year demonstration will: Maintain Medicaid state plan eligibility; Maintain Medicaid state plan benefits; Continue to allow the state to require eligible individuals to enroll in managed care organizations (MCOs) to receive covered benefits through such MCOs, including individuals on HCBS waivers, except: o American Indian/Alaska Natives are presumptively enrolled in KanCare but will have the option of affirmatively opting -out of managed care. Provide benefits, including long -term services and supports (LTSS) and HCBS, via managed care; Extend the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment program; and Design a nd implement an alternative payment model (APM) program to replace the DSRIP program Maintain the Safety Net Care Pool to support hospitals that provide uncompensated care to Medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured. Increase beneficiary access to substan ce use disorder (SUD) treatment services. Provide work opportunities and supports for individuals with specific behavioral health conditions and other disabilities. The KanCare demonstration will assist the state in its goals to: Continue to provide inte gration and coordination of care across the whole spectrum of health to include physical health, behavioral health, and LTSS/HCBS; Further improve the quality of care Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries receive through integrated care coordination and financial incentives paid for performance (quality and outcomes); KanCare Second Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 06.30.2021 3 Maintain Medicaid cost control by emphasizing health, wellness, prevention, and early detection as well as integration and coordination of care; Continue to establish long -lasting reforms that sus tain the improvements in quality of health and wellness for Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries and provide a model for other states for Medicaid payment and delivery system reforms as well; Help Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries achieve healthier, more independent lives by coordinating services to strengthen social determinants of health and independence and person -centered planning; Promote higher levels of member independence through employment programs; Drive performance and improve quality of care for Kansas Med icaid beneficiaries by integrating value - based models, purchasing strategies and quality improvement programs; and Improve effectiveness and efficiency of the state Medicaid program with increased alignment of MCO operations, data analytic capabilities and expanded beneficiary access to SUD services . This quarterly report is submitted pursuant to item #64 of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Special Terms and Conditions (STCs) issued regarding the KanCare 1115(a) Medicaid demonstration program, and in the format outlined in Attachment A of the STCs.

KanCare First Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 06.30.2021 19 e. Quality of care: Please see Section IX \"Quality Assurance/Monitoring Activity \" below. The HCBS Quality Review Report for October -December 2020 is attached to this report. f. Changes in provider qualifications/standards: None. g. Access: As noted in previous reports, members who are not in their open enrollment period are unable to change plans without a good cause reason (GCR) pursuant to 42 CFR 438.56 and the KanCare STCs. Most GCR requests were related to provider choice, which is not a n acceptable reason to switch plans outside of open enrollment. If a GCR is denied by KDHE, the member is given appeal/fair hearing rights. There were zero state fair hearing requests received for denied GCRs from April - June 2021. A summary of second quarter GCR action, follows: Status April May June Total GCRs filed 29 27 31 Approved 1 0 1 Denied 22 24 20 Withdrawn (resolved, no need to change) 1 1 2 Dismissed (due to inability to contact the member) 5 2 8 Pending 0 0 0 Providers are constantly added to the MCOs' networks, with much of the effort focused upon HCBS service providers . The counts below represent the unique number of NPIs \u2014or, where the NPI is not available \u2014provider name and service locations (based on the Kan Care county designation identified in the KanCare Code Guide). This results in counts for the following: Providers with a service location in a Kansas county are counted once for each county. Providers with a service location in a border area are counted o nce for each state in which they have a service location that is within 50 miles of the KS border. Providers for services provided in the home are counted once for each county in which they are contracted to provide services. KanCare MCO # of Unique Prov iders as of 9/30/2020 # of Unique Providers as of 12 /31/2020 # of Unique Providers as of 3/31/2021 # of Unique Providers as counts reflect revisions subsequent to annual audit and other meetings with MCOs that occurred in Quarter 4, 2020. h. Payment rates: Payment rates were updated to reflect utilization experience from January 1, 2018 - December 31, 2019 and to reflect policy changes ( see Section IV. Operational Developments/Issues, a. Systems and reporti ng issues, approval and contracting with new plans ). i. Health plan financial performance that is relevant to the demonstration: All KanCare MCOs remain solvent. j. Managed Long- Term Services and Supports ( MLTSS ) implementation and operation: Kansas placed 185 people on HCBS IDD waiver services, and 408 people on HCBS PD waiver services. k. Updates on the safety net care pool including DSRIP activities: DSRIP concluded on December 31, 2020. The State submitted the DSRIP Evaluation Design document on June 3, 2021. DSRIP is being replaced with a Bridge Gap Year from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. The State is using \u00a7438.6(c)(1)(iii)(B) to provide a uniform percentage increase to contracted rates between KanCare First Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 06.30.2021 20 the large public teaching hospitals and border city children's hospitals and the MCOs for inpatient and outpatient hospital services provided in CY2021. As a condition of receiving the uniform increase on inpatient and outpatient utilization, the covered hospitals will be required to report the following metrics to KDHE on a quarterly basis, as these measures will inform the State's development of an APM directed payment: (1) Number of flu vaccinations administered by age; (2) Hospital- specific counts for emergency room visits; (3) Lung Cancer Screenings with low dosage CT (Large Public Teaching Hospital); (4) Number of hospitals or clinics contacted regarding diabetes protocols and number of diabetes protocols received and reviewed; the protoc ols will not be distributed; and (5) Hospital -specific reporting to support the evaluation of the directed payment. The preprint for the Bridge Gap Year was approved on March 31, 2021. l. Information on any issues regarding the concurrent 1915(c) waivers and on any upcoming 1915(c) waiver changes (amendments, expirations, renewals): The State continues to work with CMS regarding amendments to the seven HCBS waivers, including amendments to performance measures, unbundling Assistive Services, and provisional plans of care. The State is pursuing opportunities for technical assistance offered through CMS. The State has begun the review and analysis of the SED and Autism waivers in preparation for their renewal scheduled for April of 2022. m. Legislati ve activity: The Robert G. (Bob) Bethell Joint Committee on Home and Community Based Services and KanCare Oversight met April 22, 2021 . The Committee heard presentations from individuals, providers, and organizations related to KanCare, KDHE and KDADS. KDADS presented information on the four state hospitals and Nursing Facilities (NFs) including COVID 19 updates, visitation guidelines, antipsychotic drugs, and nursing facility receiverships. KDADS also provided updates on the HCBS waiting lists, HCBS Final Rule, the PACE Program, and PRTFs. Much of the focus, as noted below, during the 2021 legislative session was on Behavioral Health. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) are coming to Kansas, in addition to 988 call center services and mobile crisis. The Committee also heard updates from the KanCare Ombudsman and the Medicaid Inspector General. Each MCO also provided information about their operations. The Kansas Legislature returned on January 11, 2021. KDADS presented to several leg islative committees includ ing Senate Ways and Means, House Appropriations, House Social Service Budget Committee, Senate Public Health and Welfare, House Health and Human Services, and House Children and Seniors. Topics included Nursing Homes, HCBS Programs, Mental Health Programs, State Hospitals , and Budget updates. S pecific issues covered were Mental Health Moder nization and Reform, 988 Hotline , CCBHC, Executive Reorganization Order (ERO), PACE, State Hospital salaries and Moratorium, and COVID updates. KDHE Secretary, Dr. Lee Norman, State Medicaid Director, Sarah Fertig, and Director of Medicaid Operations, Christiane Swartz, presented their respective updates. Dr. Norman covered COVID 19 vaccine delivery and usage, COVID -19 testing, hospital capacity management, and a Johnson & Johnson update. Sarah Fertig gave a KanCare program update and a KanCare analytics & performance metrics update. Christiane Swartz gave an eligibility update, a Medicaid eligibility applications update, and an update on KDHE Cle aringhouse staffing. Under the Families First Coronavirus Act, KDHE eligibility workers continue to delay annual reviews in order to provide continuous coverage for current enrollees during the PHE. The only exceptions for eligibility discontinuation are if the person is no longer a Kansas resident, if the KanCare First Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 06.30.2021 21 person dies, or if the person voluntarily withdraws from the Medicaid program. This process will remain in place for Kansas to continue to receive the enhanced federal share of 6.2% for Medicaid and an increase of 4.34% for CHIP through the termination of the PHE. Overview of other changes made to the Medicaid program during the PHE: Applicants and beneficiaries have an additional 120 days to request a fair hearing, if the original 33 -day deadline falls between March 2020 and the end of the PHE Remove all cost sharing for testing/treatment of COVID -19 for KanCare members Allow for greater flexibility of day service locations for HCBS members Services can be rendered in home by a family member, with reimbursement to the family member Allow for out of state, non -KanCare providers to provide services in Kansas Suspend PASRR Level 1 and Level 2 requirements for 30 days Temporarily cease all physical visits from MCOs to providers/members Allow for early re fill of maintenance prescriptions; increase level of pharmacy delivery and mail order availability Temporarily allow for documented verbal consent on person -centered plans of care Providers are regularly updated through the Kansas Medical Assistance Program (KMAP) website of changes made to the program. A special page titled \"COVID -19 KMAP Providers Information Page 3\" was added to assist providers as a 'one -stop location' for bulletins, phone numbers, and links to online resources. n. Other Operational Issues: Eligibility workers discontinued alternative work schedules and returned to normal in -person work operations effective June 14. Guidance for wearing masks, social distancing, following good hygiene and limiting the gathering of large groups where social distancing cannot be maintained have been communicated to all employees in order to keep staff safe and enable Medicaid applications to be processed timely. V. Policy Developments/Issues General Policy Issues : Kansas addressed policy concerns related to MCOs and state requirements through weekly KanCare Policy Committee, monthly KanCare Steering Committee, and monthly joint and one -on- one meetings between KDHE, KDADS and MCO leadership. Policy changes are also c ommunicated to MCOs through other scheduled and ad hoc meetings as necessary to ensure leadership and program staff are aware of the changes. All policies affecting the operation of the Kansas Medicaid program and MMIS are addressed through a defined and w ell-developed process that is inclusive (obtaining input from and receiving review by user groups, all affected business areas, the state Medicaid policy team, the state's fiscal agent and Medicaid leadership) and results in documentation of the approved c hange. VI. Financial/Budget Neutrality Development/Issues Budget neutrality: The State has updated the Budget Neutrality template provided by CMS and has submitted this through the PMDA system. The expenditures contained in the document reconcile to Schedul e C from the CMS 64 report for QE 6/30/2021. General reporting issues: KDHE continues to work with Gainwell Technologies , the fiscal agent, to modify reports as needed to have all data required in an appropriate format for efficient Section 1115 demonstra tion reporting.

VIII. Consumer Issues A summary of the consumer issues is below: Issue Resolution Action Taken to Prevent Further Occurrences KanCare First Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 06.30.2021 24 Consumers had claims denied due to Third Party Liability (TPL) either not on file or not showing terminated. The State worked with KMAP to ensure updates for the consumers who were having claims concerns to either add or remo ve the TPL coverage for the specific cases. The State has established a weekly spreadsheet that the MCO(s) can submit to the State so that as they become aware of any changes, they can submit them for update. There have been multiple consumers who have either been homeless or in conditions that were not habitable during this last quarter. With this came a difficulty for accessing Medicaid services. Multiple State agencies partnered together, the appropriate MCO, and community providers to not only m eet the medical requirements of the consumers but the housing needs as well. The State has linked the Housing individual(s) from KDADS with the appropriate MCO Manager(s) at KDHE to ensure that if there are multi -tier concerns in the future that the agenc ies will work together with the MCO and any community partners to ensure the consumers' needs are being met on all levels. IX. Quality Assurance/Monitoring Activity The State Quality Management Strategy (QMS) - The QMS is designed to provide an overarching framework for the State to allocate resources in an efficient manner with the objective of driving meaningful Quality Improvement (QI). Underneath the QMS lies the State's monitoring and oversight activities, across KDHE and KDADS, that act as an early alert system to more rapidly address MCO compliance issues and reported variances from expected results. Those monitoring and oversight activities represent the State's ongoing actions to ensure compliance with Federal and State contract standards. The framework of the QMS has been redesigned to look at the KanCare program and the population it serves in a holistic fashion to address all physical, behavioral, functional, and social determinants of health and independence needs of the enrolled population. The QMS serves as the launch pad from which the State will continue to build and implement continuous QI principals in key a reas of the KanCare program. The State will continue to scale the requirements of the QMS to address and support ongoing system transformation. A requirement for approval of the 1115 waiver was development of a State QMS to define waiver goals and corresp onding statewide strategies, as well as all standards and technical specifications for contract performance measurement, analysis, and reporting. CMS finalized new expectations for managed care service delivery in the 2017 Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Final Rule. The intent of this QMS revision is to comply with the Final Rule, to establish regular review and revision of the State quality oversight process and maintain key State values of quality care to Medicaid recipients through continuous program impr ovement. Review and revision will feature processes for stakeholder input, tribal input, public notification, and publication to the Kansas Register. The current QMS defines technical specifications for data collection, maintenance, and reporting to demon strate recipients are receiving medically necessary services and providers are paid timely for service delivery. The original strategy includes most pre -existing program measures for specific services and financial incentives called pay for performance (P4 P) measures to withhold a percentage of the capitation payment the MCOs can earn by satisfying certain quality benchmarks. Many of the program - specific, pre -existing measures were developed for the 1915(c) disability waivers designed and managed by the ope rating agency, KDADS, and administered by the single State Medicaid agency, KDHE. Regular and consistent cross -agency review of the QMS will highlight progress toward State goals and measures and related contractor progress. The outcome findings will demon strate areas of compliance and non - compliance with Federal standards and State contract requirements. This systematic review will advance trending year over year for the State to engage contractors in continuous monitoring and improvement activities that u ltimately impact the quality of services and reinforce positive change. The State participated in the following activities: KanCare First Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 06.30.2021 25 Ongoing automated report management, review, and feedback occurred between the State and the MCOs. Reports from the MCOs consist of a wide range of data reported on standardized templates. State administration of the reporting site transitioned to the External Quality Review (EQR) audit team. The team began working with the site administrator to make some improvements to the reporting database. For example, allowing PowerPoint documents to be uploaded, sending email alerts when due dates are changed, and updating the tip sheets for users with more robust information. The State added Provider Satisfaction Survey results to the Report Administration system. This includes MCO submission of survey tools and methodology for State approval prior to survey implementation. These changes have been approved by the State and the MCOs and are pending contract amendment approval from CMS. The me thodologies for the 2021 surveys are due August 31, 2021. SHP has submitted their methodology and more information was requested, as many of the new contract requirements were not included. Specific templates were developed for reporting key performance components for the KanCare program through cross -agency and MCO collaboration. The process of report management, review, and feedback is now automated to ensure efficient access to reported information and maximum utilization/feedback related to the data. Administrators are developing new training for staff to increase efficiency across the platform. Monitored the External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) work plan. KFMC, the State's EQRO, and the State developed a tool to track EQRO, State, and MCO deliverables due dates. The tool is updated daily by KFMC and distributed to the State and MCOs quarterly. Performance Improvement Project (PIP) meetings occurred in April, May, and June and included the EQRO, MCOs, KDADS and KDHE. The EQRO conducted indiv idual training sessions with each MCO regarding the web -based reporting system for monthly submission of PIP data. The new system allows for tracking and trending of reports and to monitor the effectiveness of MCO interventions. The annual reports of each MCOs Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) PIP were reviewed by KFMC and approved by KDHE. Adjustments were made to PIP interventions that were considered ineffective, not capturing all of the necessary data, or ones that required enhancement. Two new PIPs, MCO Collaborative COVID -19 Vaccination and UHC's Antidepressant Medication Management (AMM), have approved interventions and are nearing the methodology approval phase. The Fiscal Year 2020 CMS 416 report was approved by the State of Kansas in June 2021. A comparison of the 2019 Fiscal Year data to the 2020 Fiscal Year data revealed that the participation rates improved in one age category, stayed the same in two age cate gories, and decreased in four age categories. It is possible that the data is reflective of a COVID -19 impact. A member -friendly table of all the MCOs' PIPs, with a simplified description of their interventions, was added to the KanCare website 4. KDHE de veloped a table that includes more technical information and highlights the change being piloted with each intervention. Both of these documents are being updated to reflect UHC changing their Prenatal and Postpartum Care (PPC) ending, and the COVID -19 Vaccine PIP replacement. Once these changes are finalized, the new versions will be posted. A meeting occurred with the EQRO, MCOs, KDADS, and KDHE in April to discuss EQRO activities and conce rns. KDHE continued monthly, informal meetings with KFMC to touch base on activities and to plan agendas for the Quarterly formal EQRO and monthly PIP meetings. The State's 2020 Annual Contract Review findings were delivered to the MCOs. The MCOs then had 30 days to submit a remediation plan for any finding of \"Partially Met\" or below. The State received several remediation plans which are subject to the State's experts for approval. 4 https://www.kancare.ks.gov/policies -and- reports/quality- measurement KanCare First Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 06.30.2021 26 Remediation plans that do not adequately meet the State's standard are re -negotiated with the MCO directly to ensure timely compliance. A summary of the 2020 findings are provided in the table below. Any 2020 finding of \"Minimally Met\" or below will be reviewed again in the 2021 Annual Contract Review.

The results were reviewed and considered for implementation in the 2021 Annual Contract Review. Medicaid Fraud Control Unit monthly meetings were held with the Attorney General's office to address fraud, waste, abuse cases, referrals to MCOs and State, and collaborate on solutions to identify and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. Continued state staff participation in cross -agency long- term care meetings to report quality assurance and programmatic activities to KDHE for oversight and collaboration. Continued participation in weekly calls with each MCO to discuss ongoing provider and member issues, and to troubleshoot operational problems. Progress is monitored through these calls and through issue logs. Leadership from KDADS, KDHE and the three MCOs meet monthly to discuss issues and improvements to KanCare. Monitored large, global system issues through a weekly log issued to all MCOs and the State's fiscal agent. The resulting log is posted on the KanCare website for providers and other interested parties. Continued monthly meetings to discuss trend s and progress. Monitored member or provider specific issues through a tracking database that is shared with MCOs and KDADS for weekly review. Attended various provider training and workshops presented by the MCOs. Monitored for accuracy, answer questions as needed. KanCare First Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 06.30.2021 29 Redesigned the Network Adequacy section of the KanCare website to improve ease of use for members locating information, including the count of Medicaid providers. Continued work to revise the 2018; held collaboration meetings with KDHE and KDAD S staff to revise and update the goals and objectives. The State has been updating the QMS to comply with the Quality Strategy Toolkit that was released in June 2021. The changes to the original QMS revision have been delayed, in part, due to adjustments b eing made to comply with the new CMS toolkit. One example of this is an increased focus on LTSS performance measures. We are in the process of gathering data to appropriately track LTSS metrics. Requested data from several sources including KDADS, MCOs, EQ RO, and internally at KDHE. Received stratified data for four HEDIS measures to determine if any health disparities exist. Data will be included in the revised QMS. The EQRO will complete a review of the effectiveness of the prior QMS. The State plans to incorporate recommendation s from the evaluation in the revised QMS. Reviewed and incorporated feedback from CMS regarding the prior QMS into this revised QMS. The State is transitioning toward a data driven QMS that follows the CFR as closely as possible. The State hopes to post the QMS for public and tribal feedback in fall of 2021. For the programs administered by KDADS: The Quality Assurance (QA) process is designed to give continuous feedback to KDADS, KDHE, and stakeholders regarding the quality of services being provided to KanCare members. KDADS quality assurance staff are integrated in the Aging & Disability Community Services and Programs Commission (A&D CSP) to align staff resources for efficient and timely performance measurement. QA staff review random samples of individual case files to monitor and report compliance with performance measures designated in each of the approved HCBS waivers . The MCOs contracted with Averifi to serve as a single vendor to conduct HCBS Provider Qualification audits. Programs administered by KDADS: These measures are monitored and reviewed in collaboration with program staff in the A&D CSP Commission and reported through the Financial and Information Services Commission at KDADS. This oversight is enhanced through collaboration with the Dep artment of Children and Families and the Department of Health and Environment . A quality assurance protocol and interpretative guidelines are utilized to document this process and have been established with the goal of ensuring consistency in the reviews. Below is the updated timeline that the KDADS Quality Review Team follows regarding the quality review process.

Managed Care Reporting Requirements a. A description of network adequacy reporting including GeoAccess mapping: KanCare First Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 06.30.2021 30 Each MCO submits a quarterly network adequacy report. The State uses this report to monitor the quality of network data and changes to the networks, drill down into provider types and specialties, and extract data to respond to requests received from various stakeholders. The State's network data and analysis tools were moved from Excel into a dedicated database on a secure server during the second quarter of 2019. This database allows the State to give more robust and timely feedback to the MCOs. This method is less prone to breakdowns and improves business continuity. KDHE continued to give MCOs feedback on the accuracy and completeness of their quarterly report. As MCOs improve their reporting, feedback has become less about basic errors (duplicates) and more detailed (at provider level). The Provider Network team corrected the SQL coding errors and implemented an updated fe edback report. Improvements included making the report flow better, added information about Home Health provider findings, and inclusion of capacity error data. The State worked with Sunflower to correct an over- reporting of duplicates error and with Ae tna to correct their HCBS provider reporting. The State provided individualized feedback to MCOs to improve accuracy of mapped providers and HCBS provider reporting. The State team made improvements to the Access and Availability Report, the NEMT report, the feedback report, mapping formats, Non -Participating Provider Reliance Report, and a HCBS Service Delivery Report. The team continues to match the MCOs' reports against additional data sources to give a clearer picture of the reports' accuracy and completeness. MCOs were sent feedback on the acute care hospitals reported in their first quarter PNtwk report and Geo map. MCOs were asked to report back on discrepancies found between their reports and the State's list. This is due back next quarter. Mappi ng activities continued with the newly developed automated procedure, using ArcGIS Pro, to map providers based on the MCOs provider network report submissions. The State utilized the maps to compare the GeoAccess map that the MCO submits to find errors, om issions, or verify gaps in coverage. This process ran smoothly with the network data submitted in quarter one as well as quarter two. The State completed the development of an automated process to map HCBS providers and the number of members per waiver in each county. Most HCBS service providers travel to the member. Because there is a potential for privacy violations, these maps are not shared publicly, but are used for internal analysis of network adequacy. The work this quarter focused on improving th e data reporting by the MCOs so that providers are counted correctly and discussing options for storing and sharing this large amount of data over time. MCOs submitted exception requests where for OBGYN providers are lacking. MCOs are working to close these gaps in the provider network by adding new providers and documenting those activities. The team discovered that one MCO was reporting an OBGYN on their map that was not a contracted OBGYN provider, and they were required to remove that provider from t heir map (see the yellow highlighted section in the map below). This MCO will now be required to report quarterly on progress to fill this coverage gap in the Access and Availability report. The State requested and received exception requests for allerg ists and gastroenterologists. The State worked with the MCOs to understand the function of this process and MCOs needed several submissions to complete the process correctly. Each MCO had flaws in their submission (i.e., not explaining why a provider was n ot included in their network, adding providers where gaps do not exist, relying on only one data source, etc.) Allergist changes January 1, 2020 to April 1, 2020 (see the yellow highlighted sections in the map below): SHP removed providers from Allen co unty, this provider no longer serves this county KanCare First Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 06.30.2021 31 ABH added a provider in Scott county closing a gap in south central part of Kansas UHC began contracting with a provider in Scott county which will also close a gap in south central Kansas Gastroenterologis t changes January 1, 2020 to April 1, 2020 (see the yellow highlighted section in the map below): SHP closed a gap in NW part of State by adding a provider in Sherman county ABH closed a gap in NW part of State by adding a provider in Sherman county ABH re moved an incorrectly included provider in Ellis county (moved out of state) ABH began contracting with a provider in Kearney, NE The MCOs will continue to research these gaps and will submit plans for addressing them in the Access and Availability reports each quarter until the gaps are closed. The State expects to close more gaps for these specialties in the next quarter. KDHE and KDADS GeoAccess standards are posted on our KanCare website. Reports and Maps: This report combines a mapped provider report from each MCO and provides a side -by-side comparison of the access maps for each plan by specialty as well as a trending graph for each provider type being mapped.

Summary of ombudsman activities: The report for the second quarter of calendar year 20 21 is attached . f. Summary of MCO critical incident report: The Adverse Incident Reporting (AIR) system is a critical incident management reporting and moni toring system for the detection, prevention, reporting, investigation, and remediation of critical incidents with design components to ensure proper follow -up and resolution occurs for all defined adverse incidents. Additional requirements have been implem ented to confirm review and resolutions regarding instances of seclusion, restraint, restrictive intervention, and death followed appropriate policies and procedures. KDADS implemented enhancements to the AIR system on 9/17/18. These enhancements allow KDA DS, KDHE, and MCOs to manage specific critical incidents in accordance with KDADS' AIR Policy. All the MCOs have access to the system. MCOs and KDADS staff may now both read and write information directly into the AIR system. Creating an Adverse Incident Report is forward facing, so anyone from a concerned citizen to an MCO Care Coordinator can report into the AIR system by visiting the KDADS website 6 and selecting Adverse Incident Reporting (AIR) under the quick links. All reports are input into the system electronically. While a system with the Kansas Department for Children and Families ( DCF) is being developed to automatically enter determinations into AIR, KDADS requires duplicate reporting for instances of Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation to both DCF and the AIR system. Determinations received from DCF are received by KDADS staff who review the AIR system and attach to an existing report, or manually enter reports that are not already in the AIR system. After reports are received and reviewed and waiver information is verified by KDADS staff in MMIS, MCOs receive notification of assigned reports. MCOs have the ability to provide follow -up informatio n within the AIR system and address corrective action plans issued by KDADS as appropriate. To protect member protected health information, MCO access is limited to only their enrolled members. Please note that Kansas is in the process of establishing a me morandum of understanding (MOU) between KDADS and DCF to improve communication, data sharing and leverage resources between the agencies. KDADS Program Integrity continues providing AIR training to Community Service Providers and any interested parties statewide upon request. Access to training materials and contact information to request a training is located on the KDADS website. Along with provider and individual training, KDADS provides updated trainings to the MCOs as requested for new staff and as a refresher to ensure efficient and consistent processes. AIR is not intended to replace the State reporting system for abuse, neglect, and exploitation (ANE) of individuals who are served on the behavioral health and HCBS programs. ANE 6 www.kdads.ks.gov KanCare First Quarter Report to CMS - Quarter Ending 06.30.2021 39 substantiations are reported separately to KDADS from the Department of Children and Families (DCF) and monitored by the KDADS program integrity team. The program integrity team ensures individuals with reported ANE are receiving adequate supports and protections available t hrough KDADS programs, KanCare, and other community resources.

Highlights/Dashboard A. Enhancements 1. Call Handler for Topeka office The call handler was put in place in June. This is being done primarily to better serve those whose primary language is Spanish. It provides four options for people calling the toll free number and being routed to the Topeka office: Spanish - routes to a line that provides how to leave a message in Spanish Providers - transfers provider calls to KDHE Health Care Finance front desk and they will be routed to a Provider Manager for assistance. Clearinghouse - if callers are trying to reach the KanCare Clearinghouse, they can choose this option and will be routed directly to the toll free number. The caller can stay on the line or press zero to get the KanCare Ombudsman office. The next step is setting up the same call handler options for the Kansas City Satellite office. 2. Outreach: A byproduct of th e AmeriCorps VISTA application assistance project (see page 19, B.) has been , when they contact these organizations (i.e. Local Public Health Departments , etc.) , they are explaining what our organization does, what resources we have available and asking if they would like a packet of our brochures to sh are with staff and consumers. We have mailed out seven boxes of brochures so far. Q1/2020 Q2/2020 Q3/2021 Q4/2020 Q1/2021 Q2/2021 Outreach 74 16 96 57 49 156 3. KanCare Ombudsman Listening Sessions The KanCare Ombudsman office will be doing a series of listening session s this fall that will be preceded by a survey . The purpose of the listening sessions will be to get stakeholder input on the operation , performance , and suggested enhancements of the KanCare Ombudsman office. 4. Volunteer Satisfaction Survey In late April, WSU MSW Practicum Student Britt Doerner worked with CEI and Ombudsman staff to create and distribute a volunteer satisfaction survey. From 4/18-5/1, five volunteers responded via the Q ualtrics platform. Results are below. In general, comments were positive regarding their volunteer experience. See Appendix B. KanCare Ombudsman Qtr. 2, 202 1 Report Page 5 III. KanCare Ombudsman Purpose The KanCare Ombudsman Office helps Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries and applicants, with a priority on individuals participating in long-term supports and services through KanCare. The KanCare Ombudsman Office assists KanCare beneficiaries and applicants with access, service and benefit problems. The KanCare Ombudsman office helps with: Answers to questions Resolving issues Understanding letters from KanCare Respo nding when you disagree with a decision or change Completing an application or renewal Filing a complaint (grievance) Filing an appeal or fair hearing Learning about in-home services, also called Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Special Terms and Conditions (2019 -2023), Section 36 for KanCare, provides the KanCare Ombudsman program description and objectives. IV. Accessibility to the Ombudsman's Office A. Initial Contacts The KanCare Ombudsman Office was ava ilable to members and applicants of KanCare (Medicaid) by phone, email, written communication, social media and the Integrated R eferral and Intake S ystem (IRIS) during secon quarter of 202 1. The KanCare Ombudsman Office has helped KanCare members and applicants since the inception of KanCare in January 2013. Starting in November 2015, the KanCare Ombudsman office began a volunteer program to assist with answering calls and helping with applications. There are two satellite offices; Wichita and Kansas City. The last several quarters of contacts are down ; we believe it is due to COVID -19. Initial Contacts Qtr. 1 Qtr. 2 Qtr. 3 Qtr. 4 2014 545 474 526 547 2015 510 462 579 524 2016 1,130 846 687 523 2017 825 835 970 1,040 2018 1,214 1,059 1,088 1,124 2019 1,060 1,097 1,071 601 2021 564 591 KanCare Ombudsman Qtr. 2, 202 1 Report Page 6 The chart below shows an example of one other organization that has had a significant decrease in calls during the COVID -19 pandemic as well . According to this information it appears that the Clearinghouse contacts have a similar decrease to first quarter last year (2020) as the KanCare Ombudsman office. Q4 Q1 Ombudsman Volunteer Program The KanCare Ombudsman Office has two satellite office s for the volunteer program; one in Kansas City metro area and on e in Wichita. The volunteers in both satellite offices answer KanCare questions, help with issues and assist with filling out KanCare applications (during COVID -19, by phone only). During second quarter, the re have been volunteers assisting in the offices (2 in each office , two volunteer s in training ; one in each office ). They continue their training into third quarter. Both satellite offices have COVID -19 protocol for people in the buildings and the number of people in the buildings have been very limited. Calls are covered by volunteers in the satellite offices, and when there is a gap in coverage, the Top eka staff cover the phones. Office Volunteer Hours # of Volunteers # of hours covered/wk.

KanCare Ombudsman Qtr. 2, 202 1 Report Page 7 V. Outreach by KanCare Ombudsman Office The KanCare Ombudsman Office is responsible for helping members , applicants and providers understand the KanCare application process, benefits and services, and provide training and outreach to community organizations. The office does this through resources provided on the KanCare Ombudsman web pages, resources provided with contacts to members , applicants and providers, and outreach through conferences, conference calls, video calls, social media, and in -person contacts . The large increase in contacts for second quarter is directly related to our AmeriCorps VISTA volunteers. They have begun the process of updating our KanCare Application Assistance Guide that lists organizations that help with filling out KanCare applications. They are not only checking current organizations on the list, but also contacting all Local Public Health Departments and other community organizations that have the potential to provide that type of assistance. They are explaining what our organization does , what resources we have available and asking if they would like a packet of our brochures to share with staff and consumers. We are very excited about this outreach and hope that it will create new opportunities for collaboration across the state. The below chart shows the outreach efforts by the KanCare Ombudsman Office.

KanCare/Medicaid members by Region This chart shows the KanCare/Medicaid population by the KanCare Ombudsman regions. The majority of the Medicaid population is located in the eastern two regions. Most Medicaid members are not being dropped at this time due to COVID -19, so the bottom line number is increasing each quarter. Kansas Population Density This map shows the population density of Kansas and helps in understanding why most of the Medicaid population and KanCare Ombudsman calls are from the eastern part of Kansas. This chart is b ased on 2015 Census data - www .KCDCinfo.ks.gov Kansas Population Density map using number of people per square mile (ppsm) 5 Urban - 150+ ppsm 4 Semi -Urban - 40-149.9 ppsm 3 Densely -Settled Rural - 20 to 39.9 ppsm 2 Rural - 6 to 19.9 ppsm 1 Frontier - less than 6 ppsm KanCare Ombudsman Qtr. 2, 202 1 Report Page 10 B. Data by Office Location Initial phone calls to the KanCare Ombudsman Office toll-free number (1 -855-643-8180) are sent directly to one of three KanCare Ombudsman offices based on the area code the call is coming from. The Kansas City office receives 913, 785 and 816 area code calls. The Wichita office receives 316 and 6 20 area code calls. All other toll -free calls go to the Main office (Topeka) in addition to direct calls to staff .

The Ombudsman Office is tracking priorities for two purposes: This allows our staff and volunteers to pull up pending cases, review their status and possibly request an update from the partnering organization that we have requested assistance from. This helps provide information on the more complex cases that are worked by the Ombudsman Office. KanCare Ombudsman Qtr. 2, 202 1 Report Page 13 The priorities are defined as follows: HCBS - Home and Community Based Services Long Term Care/NF - Long Term Care/Nursing Facility Urgent Medical Need - 1) the re is a medical need, 2) if the need is not resolved in 5 -10 days, the person could end up in the hospital. Urgent - non-medical need that needs to be resolved in the next 7 -10 days; could be eviction from home or nursing facility or urgent financial. Life Threatening - If not resolved in 1 -4 days person's life could be endangered. (should not be used very often.)

Responding to Issues 1. KanCare Ombudsman Office response to members/applicants The Ombudsman Office goal is to respond to a contact within two business days. During the COVID -19 pandemic, our goal changed to responding within 3-4 business days. We went back to the goal of answering calls within two business days during first quarter of 2021 . This was due to the addition of our Volunteer Coordinator who is experienced in taking calls and assists in the Kansas City Satellite office when volunteers are not available.

Enhancement: Call Handler for Topeka office The call handler for the Topeka office was put in place in June. This is being done primarily to better serve those whose primary language is Spanish. It provides four options for people calling the toll free number and being routed to the Topeka office: Spanish - routes to a line that tells how to leave a message in Spanish Providers - transfers provider calls to KDHE Health Care Finance front desk to be routed to a Provider Manager for assistance. Clearinghouse - if callers are trying to reach the KanCare Clearinghouse, they can choose this option and will be routed directly to the number. The caller can stay on the line or press zero to get t he KanCare Ombudsman office. The next step is setting up the same call handler options for the Kansas City office. B. Volunteer Satisfaction Survey Our AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer in the Wichita Satellite Office created, sent out, and compiled the results of a volunteer satisfaction survey. There were a couple of areas for improvement and those have already been addressed and are in place. See Appendix B for survey details. C. Future Project: Application Assistance Guide AmeriCorps VISTAs in our off ices are updating the KanCare Application Assistance Guide that lists community organizations, by county, that help with applications; the county, organization name, the contact number, and the type of applications they assist with (i.e. Children with Families, Elderly and Disabled, etc.) . Some organizations only help with Children and Family Applications, some only help with Elderly and Disabled, others help with all. Should be completed during third quarter. D. Future Project: KanCare Ombudsman Listening Sessions The KanCare Ombudsman office will be doing a series of listening session s this fall that will be preceded by a survey. The purpose of the listening sessions will be to get stakeholder input into the operation, performance, and suggested enhanceme nts of the KanCare Ombudsman office.

Appendix B: Volunteer Sati sfaction Student Britt Doerner worked with CEI and Ombudsman staff to create and distribute a volunteer satisfaction survey. From 4/ 18-5/1, five volunteers responded via the Qualtrics platform. Results are below. In general, comments were positive regarding their volunteer experience. In regard to showing appreciation, there was a request for starting up education calls . Education calls for volunteers was in the works when the survey was completed. We started monthly education calls for volunteers in May. This also allows the opportunity to talk about how a case may have positively impacted someone's life (without sharing names or personal information ). In regard to improving their experience, the WSU office was updated and made to be more efficient for both volunteer s and staff. 1. What happens on a shift, as a Volunteer, that brings you back/feels rewarding/keeps you doing this work? Helping somebody relieve frustration and access benefits that make their lives a little better As I've learned more about Kancare I've gained confidence in helping callers with their issues and I've always felt supported when asking our supervisors for help when faced wi th a new question. The callers generally express their appreciation, especially some of those \"special\" calls that just need someone to listen to their frustrations. :) Helping the public wade through the complexities. The satisfaction of when somethin g we did on a call affected and changed someone's day for some reason. Especially if/when we report something frustrating on behalf of clients such as rude customer service from the Clearinghouse. It is nice that we can be a witness and report such things. It is so refreshing when KanCare has committed some wrong that the consumer got jilted on. Then when it is brought to our attention, we can get it corrected and bring attention to it, so it can't be disregarded or ignored anymore. It feels like the world is balanced again to help someone who gets what they are entitled to. Working with callers to find answers always feel rewarding, especially when the answers are things that the caller hoped for or needed. Even when the call doesn't end with the answer a caller was hoping for, it still feels powerful to have helped someone find the next step or the next option. My experience has been that people just need something tangible and straightforward to do within the overwhelming system of Medicaid. Help ing with that is a really encouraging experience. KanCare Ombudsman Qtr. 2, 202 1 Report Page 25 2. Do you have any suggestions on how the KanCare Ombudsman Office can improve in showing appreciation to Volunteers? Providing opportunities to socialize with other volunteers Kerrie, Lisa, Holly, and Josephine have always been very kind in expressing their appreciation for our time. I personally don't feel this needs improvement. Sharing examples of where we made a difference. Hmm. No. I feel very appreciated as a volunteer. I don't feel overlooked or that I am not appreciated by the staff. I don't what else could be done to increase the appreciation. I feel like \"showing appreciation\" can mean a lot of different things - I think that starting the monthly volunteer education calls could be a good op portunity to discuss things that we're doing well and/or talk about good things in our lives. I would love a chance to connect to other volunteers in the program and learn about the ways that we each feel appreciation. 3. Overall, how satisfied are you with your experience as a KanCare Ombudsman Volunteer? Extremely satisfied Extremely satisfied Somewhat satisfied Extremely satisfied Extremely satisfied 4. What can the KanCare Ombudsman Office do to improve your overall experience as a Volunteer? Provide more social time with peers , supervisors and other volunteers I'm comfortable at this time. I would like us to be able to interact with general public again, but I understand this is out of our hands at the moment. Again, I can't come up with any ideas. Everyone always seems so grateful and eager to answer questions. I feel so much excitement through my day when I am volunteering. I can't imagine volunteering anywhere else. There is so much information that I learn a nd definitely appreciate the opportunity to volunteer for the KanCare Ombudsman Office. I work in the CEI satellite office and I really want to organize that office. That would make me feel a lot more prepared for taking calls - knowing exactly where to f ind documents I might need, instructions that could be helpful, etc. It's not in disarray right now, but after a year of WFH life, there's definitely an opportunity to freshen that space up. KanCare Ombudsman Qtr. 2, 202 1 Report Page 26 5. Do you have any suggestions on where to find/recruit new Volunteers? Churches women's groups A friend and I were recruited at a volunteer fair at a community library. Maybe see if Wichita, Topeka and WY/JO County areas have any of those on the calendar? Maybe recruit through meetings or flye rs at community centers, especially if they have programs that draw retirees with flexible schedules. Social media platforms like Nextdoor. I don't know. United Way, Volunteermatch.org, senior centers, or Recreation Center bulletin boards? I think it could be good to look at recruiting students, both high school and college if possible. This is a great volunteer opportunity and I think that there's potential there. I know that the weekly commitment might be a challenge for some students but it might be worth talking to some school counselors and college advisors maybe?
