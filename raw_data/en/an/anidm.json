The initiative enables the ESP's leadership to learn more about the challenges faced in countries where the specialty of allergy and asthma is either non-existent, or is developing, and how best to assist these efforts. The main objective of the World Allergy Training School (WATS) is to develop learning communities, which will help build a sustainable capacity in the field of allergy by strengthening already existing knowledge and skills. WATS also strives to encourage local experts to apply this knowledge to further develop the specialty of allergy and to widen the provision of patient care. The World Allergy Training School is for physicians /general practitioner /researchers with a general background in allergy and immunology. The Emerging Societies Program is co-hosted by the World Allergy Organization and the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology:XXIV World Allergy Congress 14-17 October 2015 Seoul, Korea44The Allied Health Professional Session provided by KAAACI-KAPARD is designed for health care professionals who provide care to people with allergy, asthma and immunologic diseases.
