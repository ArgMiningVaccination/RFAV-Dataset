But often times we have forgotten who we really are. One way to accessing our True Self is by releasing the blockages to remembering our spiritual identity through Past Life Regression. Past life journeys can be very powerful and can help us deepen our understanding of our life purpose and soul lessons. In current and past lives, we create certain themes and patterns that we repeat over and over again. Past Life Regression may help to release phobias, emotional conflicts, relationship problems, and physical ailments. I will intuitively guide you through hypnosis to a deep state of relaxation. This experience varies from person to person. Most people can release limiting emotional patterns without the intensity of the original experience. Through gentle questioning you are helped to remember significant events, beliefs, feelings, and relationship patterns from the past that influence your current life. The process also includes a past life review by your soul. Your Higher Self may guide you into a deep understanding of lessons and insights you gained throughout that lifetime. This allows individuals to review and re-script memories from the past in your current life with understanding from a \"Higher Self\" perspective. Preparation for Past Life Regression: 1. In preparing for past life work it can be helpful to have a specific issue or problem that you would like to work on during the regression, although it is not necessary to have a specific question. Setting the intent by thinking about what you want from the regression session several days ahead sends a message to the subconscious mind that you are open to the experience. 2. Avoid heavy amounts of caffeine as much as possible on the day of your session. Stimulants can interfere with deep relaxation. However, if you get a headache without caffeine, do have a limited amount. 3. Get a good night's rests before you come in so you won't fall asleep during the session. 4. Try to not eat for at least an hour before your appointment, but do eat something earlier in the day so you will not be overly hungry. I will provide a microphone to attach to you phone so you are able to take your sessions with you when you leave. Know that you will get what you need at this time to help you in your spiritual growth and development. And always remember that your Higher Self or Higher Power will be there to guide you. 1.5-2 hours ...... $200 Extended Past Life Regression This is a great experience to visit multiple lifetimes.

Past life regression is a unique experience that will allow you to gain more knowledge into your past lives so that you can learn more about who you are! Have you ever felt like you were somebody else in a past lifetime? Have you ever visited a place for the first time, but felt at home and instinctually knew your way around? Have you ever had D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Have you ever had a dream where you were a different person? Have you ever had irrational fears, or unexplained reactions to situations? Wonder where they might come from? Sometimes people are just curious about where they were, what they did, and what happened to them. There are many things you can learn about yourself in this lifetime. You can learn how the past affects your spiritual purpose, and about what karma you have brought into this embodiment.
