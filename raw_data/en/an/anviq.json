Warehousing capacity remains constrained, meaning costs will remain high until utilization and availability improve. The ILW Union negotiations in Canada and the U.S. West Coast begin and UPS and the Teamsters will begin negotiating in April. The energy markets are still easing but caution is required given the increased oil prices. Food prices held steady in February 2023. The International energy agency found that a Supply gap of natural gas could emerge in European counties by the end of 2023. Iron ore supply continues be a watch, prices expected to increase significantly. The job markets in the U.S., the U.K. and Europe remain generally tight, but wage growth has slowed in the U.S. and the U.K. The labor market in the U.S. remains tight. U.S. Layoffs marks the worst since 2009, and many tech companies still have more staff than they did before the post -pandemic hiring boom. Working population in China grew by just 2.8% over the last 5 years, compared to 11.8% in 2018. Subsequently, China expects the biggest -ever wave of retirements over the next 10 years.Supply Chain Risk Summary Current Conditions3 Labor Logistics Materials Decreased StrainDecreased Strain Decreased Strain 3/29/2023Current Supply Chain UC Risks and Actions Risk Impact/ ProbabilityCategory Product Situation Mitigating Actions to Address Outlook ProbableFood -GeneralDry food Good, Frozen, All types of proteinsDry food Goods, Frozen, all types of proteins.

We should see the impact of the either, on the food markets in the next few weeks. Grain are still high due to the war in Ukraine, Probable Food ProduceDue to heavy rains and flooding in Monterey County and Watsonville, we will see shortages on green leaf and fruit (Strawberries) for the next 3 to 4 months. Produce, green leaf (80% of crops) and some fruit products (20% crops) ie . strawberries which is affected by the flooding, in Watsonville and Monterey county. Typically, it takes 90 days to grow to full crops for green leaf and 60- 70 days for strawberries. Mitigation is that we will see better crops after a full cycle of 110 to 120 days for green leaf and estimate of 70 days for Strawberries.

Health care and education work are expected to increase, while office construction is predicted to fall.Increases in non- residential construction signal continued strains on a low skilled and trained construction workforce, potentially resulting in less competition and availability of competent firms for project delivery. Probable ConstructionElectrical, Telecom and HVAC EquipmentLead times for HVAC equipment are in excess of 25- 65 weeks and Electrical Equipment and Generators are in excess of 65- 100 weeks dependent on manufacturer and size of equipment, an increase from last month. Monitor new and renovation projects for major equipment needs. Identify if funding strategy can accommodate early release of key equipment. Source -SourceBlue 2022 Fourth Quarter Update Probable Construction MaterialsSlower commercial construction activity in office, warehouse along with slower institutional construction contributed to the overall dip in escalation. Cement pricing is up 19.5% and has been affecting projects across the country with both cost and allocation. Buy America is back with new standards forth coming, may cause impacts on supply and demand adding costs.Despite an overall softening of the economy and continued recession concerns, materials remain static in their pricing and in some cases continue to rise. Recommend looking at strategies to lock in material pricing as soon as possible. ProbableEnergy: UtilitiesNatural Gas and Electricity GenerationEnergy pricing has been historically high for the last couple months but there is an anticipated stabilization of the market as we head into warmer months.Aside from utilities costs borne by the UC, we have not seen suppliers trying to recapture this price increase on their product pricing as of yet.

Supplier shifting to containerized shipping to create additional efficiency.. Probable PaperPaper PPI -is becoming more static with virgin paper. Recycled paper remains heavily impacted but decreasing.Main janitorial supplier has mentioned a decrease in recycled cardboard stock due to Amazon marketplace. We may see tightening of raw materials for recycled paper products. Food containers, packaging, and shifts from plastic to paper options are affecting the paper industry and will continue to transform the supply chain. Hybrid office programs will increase recycled paper options, but that market may never return to full strength.Pricing stabilizing but there are still supply constraints. Review virgin paper certifications for source material. Probable Furniture Office Furniture, Tables, seating, Freestanding Furniture, Systems Furniture, storage and accessoriesLogistics remains to be the biggest challenge in this area with a lack of drivers and higher fuel costs.Evaluate reupholstering services to freshen furniture as opposed to buying new. Cambridge of California is a known SBE in this space for UC. Remember, prevailing wage does not apply to delivered and placed furniture. It does apply for assembly or construction of furniture on site. ProbableProfessional ServicesTemp LaborLabor shortages have been ongoing since the pandemic due to an unprecedented 3.2% decrease in the labor force participation rate during the pandemic and the stagnation of the working -age population as the largest generation in American history reaches retirement age.Tightness in the labor market has continued into 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.4%, its lowest point since 1969. Due to these widespread labor shortages, the demand for staffing services is elevated and the supply of staffing labor is being stretched.
