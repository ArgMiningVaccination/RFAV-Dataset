Sophie Willis, Senior Subeditor ReplyInteresting debate. There is a qualification between technician and pharmacist in Ireland, pharmaceutical assistant. Its a closed register, no more being trained but they did an apprenticeship decades ago and as a result can cover a pharmacist day off each week and up to 2 weeks annual leave. The rest of the time they work alongside a pharmacist. They can only work in community. It would be a good compromise and Ireland has benefited from these healthcare professionals for decades and continues to do so. Ultimately healthcare professionals will seek good working conditions so may not solve multiples workforce problems. ReplyI too am pleased to note the PJ's interest in genomics but since 99% of our genome in contained in the microbiome you risk missing 99% of the science and the clinical consequences. It is true to say \"our genes are not our destiny\" (epi-genetics) but it is equally the case (eg from studies of identical twins) that the microbiome plays a fundamental role ReplyWorked with Arthur from 1974 to 1976 in D6 when he ran tabletting there and I was a newbie in the process improvement group. RIP old mentor! ReplyIt's very well explaining the supposed shortage but in fact there is not a shortage of pharmacists in the Uk, please look at the current Gphc register. It's actually pharmacists choosing not to work in community due to workplace conditions and pay and lack of progression. Address that first and see how you can improve working conditions as that it the root cause of the so called shortage to which you refer to when in fact there isn't a shortage, it's just a shortage of pharmacists willing to work in community. ReplyI really enjoyed reeding the topic. Thank you very much. ReplyWhen the practices/individuals changing inhalers without consultation with the patient were approached for comment, what did they say? ReplyHow many fake drugs were detected under the previous scheme ? How many packs were scanned ? How much of our time was wasted on it ? It is tragic the new scheme will be delayed ! Hopefully I will have retired before it appears . Next time the PSNC should demand a fee per pack for scanning . ReplyInteresting article ReplyCommunity pharmacists can support patients on correct inhaler technique when prescribed a new inhaler by providing a new medicines service. ReplyOnly with Herbal formula I was able to cure my schizophrenia Illness with the product I purchase from Dr Sims Gomez Herbs A Clinic in South Africa ReplyThe study acknowledges the limited conclusions that can be drawn from this - likely selection bias for people with negative views, with many complaining that the device was harder to use (variable depending on biosimilar) or pain at injection site. We don't have denominator for how many people were contacted - was it a silent majority?Much was made by originator company of their product being citrate-free and therefore less painful to inject, yet for many years it had contained citrate. That must have had an impact on patient perceptions.The pressure to deliver the switch and the top-down decisions about what biosimilars were allocated to each area didn't make things easier either. There certainly wasn't the time to bring in every patient for face-to-face discussions (as was common pre-Covid).The lessons we can draw are limited, except to say that people who felt they had enough information were less likely to complain. ReplyCompletely agree James. We switched all our patients in gastro to the citrate containing first line biosimilar. Currently only 10% of our patients are using a non-citrate biosimilar or originator having switch back/forward again after failing to tolerate the citrate biosimilar post switch. It's clearly a relevant factor, but the numbers are completely out of step with those of this study, suggesting there is bias at play.

Please bring back ranitidine it's a brilliant antacid. ReplyThis is a personal account with no study, just how I treated my early stage of Covid. My husband was diagnosed with no real serious symptoms. This is in January 2022. I began to feel increasingly not well with extreme headache and other Covid symptoms and went to go get tested. I had noticed my daughters acne medication on our window sill, Doxycycline during this time and it needed refilling. Called it in for refilling on our (myself and daughter) way to get tested, symptoms of heaviness on my chest and very labored breathing got worse. My husband got the refill, I took it at 6:07 pm and 7:52 pm, felt 100% better in terms of my breathing and no pressure on my chest. I have often wondered what could have progressed into something with no real therapeutics at my Urgent Care and the Emergency Room with over 60+ in the waiting room. I have continued to Google Doxy with aspect to Covid 19 and have been increasing my stance that it is a therapeutic that should be used. For example, with the Lancet study, etc. I am a 53 year old female that could lose weight and am glad I had that antibiotic. I also used it with Vitamin C and Zinc. ReplyI took a load of medication to Ukraine in 2001.(you can read about it in the Journal) This was to supply a dispensary in the west of the country- ie a non-urgent mission. It took extensive paper work just to get these medicines on board the bus we were using. Then we had to have paperwork for all the countries we passed through. When we got to the destination the medicines were held in quarantine for clearance by Ukrainian officials from Lviv. I realise that this is an emergency, but from my experiences medical aid from individuals is like as not going to be delayed, and the emergency might well have passed.Please, if you wish to help, send money. ReplyI'm picking up a family from Western Ukraine later this week as I have a wheelchair access vehicle and I offered. They need Levo Thyroxine. It's not a problem for me to supply a small amount as my mother has a prescription. However is it appropriate or possible to access a larger amount to supply to the area? My contact say they are running out of this medication? Please let me know if possible. Thanks ReplyFantastic ReplyReally interesting stuff! Will have to keep an eye on this in practice. Thanks so much! ReplyAs reported, there appears to be some conflation of a Pre-Payment Certificate (PPC) and the mechanism of eRD via the EPS.The PPC is 'lodged' with the pharmacy.I appreciate that the aim of a single charge for annual treatment is outwith the gift of EPS eRD - but this mechanism of supply makes sense in terms of reducing the touch-points the patient has to make in obtaining medication for a stable and persistent condition. We should be making life easier for patients.I do hope the PPC scheme doesn't complicate issues for pharmacy teams.But a simple solution would be to abolish prescriptions charges to align with other nations. ReplyNICE 2021 has updated guidance on the recommended dosing or iron. There is now a recommendation that once daily oral iron (50-100mg elemental iron) is sufficient (not 100-200mg elemental iron as this paper suggests). This is due to hepcidin, which regulates iron uptake. Multiple daily dosing of iron increases the production of hepcidin, which reduces the amount of iron uptake. Hence, multiple daily dosing does not necessarily confer increased iron absorption but may lead to increased side effects.This is taken from the updated NICE guidance:-Traditionally oral iron salts were taken as split dose, two or three times a day. More recent data suggest that lower doses and more infrequent administration may be just as effective, while probably associated with lower rates of adverse effects.The optimal drug, dosage and timing of oral iron for adults with iron deficiency anaemia are not clearly defined, and the effect of alternate day therapy on compliance and ultimate haematological response are unclear. Based on the available literature, a once daily dose of 50-100 mg of elemental iron (for example, one ferrous sulfate 200 mg tablet a day) taken in the fasting state may be the best compromise option for initial treatment.

ReplyThe question is why the UK do not consider recruiting the refugee pharmacists who are already live in the UK for so many years and cannot get back to their job in any way due to the overcomplicated rules and regulations. I am one of these people and I know so many pharmacists as me. You already have good assets but unfortunately no one would help. ReplySorry, I'm not clear on this, about 'new' applications since the new . . . Does this mean that there have been successful applications before all this 'new' framework? Are there any licensed devices/solutions 'out there'? ReplyThank you, Paul. A clear, thorough explanation of the issues. ReplyThanks. That's helped me to understand where we are and it seems, in my opinion, that the RPS Assembly made a sensible decision. ReplyA further thank you Paul and further support for the Assembly's decision. ReplyCharity status was considered by the RPSGB Council more than once in the past and rightly rejected for limiting the Society's ability to promote pharmacists and the profession. There is nothing that the Society cannot do now that would be achieved by College status, and much that could be lost. ReplyI agree Nick on Charity and College status and don't think they are the way forward but think the two issues are separate. See below. I am not convinced the Society is any nearer to operating as a body akin to Royal College than it was in 2010. In many ways things seem to have regressed somewhat. Take care ReplyFollow the NICE guidelines and avoid unnecessary litigation. They do not see individual patients face to face and cannot make idicts on that basis. Let practitioners practice and politicians debate. ReplyThe article shares the RPS Assembly's thinking as to why conversion was not pursued, but considerably less detailed insight of the actual benefits that Royal Colleges enjoy. I wonder if colleagues who support college status can fill in the gaps?Organisational transition is by its nature complex, but the pain of change alone is not a primary reason not to do something. I read that the RPS is not ready for this yet; what would tip the balance in favour of the college status? ReplyCould you please quantify what \"moderate doses\" of caffeine are? How many mg does that equate to? ReplyHi Lucy. Thanks for the query. By moderate consumption, I meant not more than the recommended limit, so 200mg per sitting and 400mg per day for non-pregnant adults. ReplyAs a former Transcom member who supported the idea of a Royal College I was interested to see Mr Bennett's perspective on this recent decision taken it seems without membership debate. Sadly my notes were shredded years ago but I hope these thoughts may offer a way forward. From memory the old dual role RPSGB was deemed unfit for purpose and it was suggested the profession needed a professional body akin to a Royal College. NB not necessarily a Royal College per se. Transcom felt the RPS without its regulatory role could do that by engaging more with other pharmacy professional bodies.I therefore reviewed how many of the Royal colleges ran to see what they offered and think I wrote to the PJ, but I cannot find anything I wrote before 2012 on the website. From memory I noted the following:-They set standards for practice and qualifications beyond those needed for professional registration with the regulator. They worked with the regulator on ensuring these met service needs. They supported members though training, publications, examinations, libraries etc Students could join for free or nominal sums Membership level was focussed on training grades with fees often linked to salary growth to help younger members join and progress. Fellowship was the aim after 8- 10 years or so and there were clear routes to gain that membership level often linked to a NHS Consultancy or GP status that were open to all. Most provided free continuing membership/fellowship to those over 70 or 75 thereby retaining their expertise for future generations, and enabling them to continue within their social and professional networks. The Colleges were run by elected Fellows with input from some elected members and students.I agree with the conclusion the new RPS does not need to try to become a Royal College. It could however move to operate much more like a Royal College than it does now.Our Fellows system needs a radical rethink. When I became one around 1991 I wrote thanking the President and asked what I might do to help the profession, but got no answer I have no idea how many members or Fellows the Society has now but suggest the balance needs to change. I am long retired and have gradually become disengaged, I am not into social media so I'm not clear what the Society can do or is doing to identify develop or improve standards that employers or regulators want.The Society might wish to commission research to see what employers and the regulator want from it and to investigate how Royal Colleges now work to see what can be done to mirror or improve as many of these roles and organisational arrangements as possible within the RPS without trying to become a College or Charity.Regards Howard McNulty. ReplyA couple more things came to kind. I mentioned Royal Colleges as did others in Transcom and I raised the idea of free membership for the over 70s to help retain expertise and give loyalty some reward. This caused a horrified reaction from RPSGB representatives, largely I think because of the enormous costs of providing and posting weekly Journals for nothing. Now that cost has gone, maybe it's time to revisit that idea. Mr Bennett refers to no name change being sought. Transcom suggested the then RPSGB should be rebranded to lose \"the unfit for purpose label\" and the simplest solution was by dropping GB from the title. I think it would be worth contacting Nigel Clarke who chaired Transcom and then led GPhC to see if he can shed any light on what the Society might do going forward and for any thoughts on the past. Asking members might even be worth undertaking too. Reply'....NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen, although available safety data does not show that ranitidine increases the risk of cancer, and any possible risk is likely to be low. However, according to the EMA, NDMA had been found in several ranitidine medicines \"above levels considered acceptable\", and there are \"unresolved questions\" about the source of the impurity...' How long will this take it's been two years ? ReplyThank you Paul for a clear explanation of the issues. ReplyTo anyone who takes up this offer: Do NOT underestimate the demands of an Independent Prescriber course. If working full time ensure your employer agrees to time for undertaking the practical shadowing and observing parts of the requirement, if not indeed additional study time, as well as the course attendance requirement. If you're working part time, also make sure you have the availability in your \"non-employed\" time plus your study time from your employer to succeed in this very demanding course. But please don't let me put you off... the Independent Prescriber annotation is an opening to all sorts of new professional activities once qualified and competent in a clinical area.

ReplyThe HSE might find it's hands tied in looking at both non-fatal and fatal cases of COVID, as unlawful killing merits a criminal rather than civil standard of proof.Independent and dispassionate post-hoc assessment can offer perspective outside of the pressure cooker of the occupational environment. Regardless of the HSE, NHS organisations have a duty of care to their employees in real time and the Duck Test applies. ReplyThe length of consultation times is a question of parity more than anything else. 10 minutes is the minimum length supposed to be given to a GP appointment and in practice is the standard. In the face of unparalleled demand and a critical mass of undiagnosed morbidity I can't imagine GPs having a great deal of sympathy with requests for more time from other disciplines within their teams.Resources, including time, are finite and will never be enough to deliver an equitable health service.

Marie and Gary Boorman ReplyConsidering how bad job prospects are for a lot of pharmacists and how there is a shortage of doctors, Id say its mutually beneficial for pharmacists and the GMC. Whilst it is understandable that the last 2 years has had a heavy toll on healthcare worldwide, there ought to be more transparency from pharmacy and medical bodies, about this subject. ReplyThis is something which needs to be addressed and something I have been going on about for many years. I graduated in 2013 but have been unable to get a DMP/ DPP during all this time. I have requested support from multiple general practices and CCGs within a 30 mile radius since 2016 but all have turned me down (ghosting, nepotism or demaninding more money than what I was earning in a month for the \"privilege\" of shadowing them for 90 hours a week). THE GPhC and RPS really need to work together with IPSs and various bodies to come to some arrangement as it is ridiculous how thousands of pharmacists who can be great assets are being wasted ReplyThe worked solution to question three is incorrect as the price used in the question is \u00a3150/60 tablets and the price used in the solution video is \u00a3105/60 tablets.

ReplyI am happy NHS Education and the GPhC is working to help pharmacist who are keen to become Independent Prescribers in getting a DMP or DPP by incentivising this role. I have also asked few GPs and CCGs for support and the first question asked is about the incentive for them or the pratice. I am looking forward to a positive outcome in this ongoing development. ReplyI am so very saddened on reading of the death of Sheila Beaumont. She had a wonderful way of making me feel most welcome when I relocated to work in East Sussex [between September 2005-February 2008]. Sheila was always looking to the future of pharmacy: Independent prescribing is the way forward! I fondly recall that Sheila was also an active member of the local Regional pharmacy group, CPPE tutor and active pharmacy delegate to many BPC conferences. Sheila you will be sorely missed. My heartfelt condolences to your family, friends, customers & colleagues. ReplyI am saddened and shocked to read of Hillary Judd's death. I am fortunate that I interviewed with Hillary for an interesting pharmacist information job role in Exeter, Devon. Although unsuccessful, Hillary agreed to keep in touch via LinkedIn.

It would have been no good for me, when I had a problem with prescription drugs. It's difficult to get meaningful advice from a phone line , especially if the person in the other end has no idea of your circumstances. Once again it is people who have not been there dreaming up schemes for those who have. The BMA don't want to support it because their members caused the problem in the first place and are unwilling to help. Even though I had a problem for 40 years and had fitness to practice issues, even I don't know the answer. But I do know it's not a phone line. ReplyThe idea of a helpline *has* come from those who have been through prescribed drug dependence and have struggled to get a) recognition of their withdrawal responses b) info on how to withdraw safely and c) support whilst doing so. A dedicated national helpline staffed by trained people could offer all of this. ReplyWell, Bob, first off, people who have become physically dependent on a prescription medication is NOT an addict. There is a massive difference between addiction and physical dependency. Many people who become dependent have not been given informed consent by their doctors that dependency could occur. Many are left with absolutely no support (emotionally, financially, etc) and have no clue how to slowly and safely taper off their drugs because doctors are so incompetent they aren't educated on taper protocols. A helpline would help point these people in a direction of someone who can help them as well has offer emotionally support for having their lives destroyed by doctors who couldn't kindly inform them their medication could cause dependency. Many people end up physically dependent, NOT ADDICTED, and end up killing themselves because they have no clue how to taper and the drug has destroyed their nervous system. Many people physically dependent are going online to taper communities and forums to learn how to taper when it should be their doctors and governments job to help them, not complete strangers. ReplyChronic fatigue is something completely different to ME/CFS. This is written with the terms confused. The complex multisystem disease, ME/CFS, see NICE Guideline ME/CFS 2021, is marked out by the symptom Post Exertional Symptom Exacerbation which includes fatigue (understatement to the point of being absurd) as well as other symptoms. It is not defined by fatigue. Chronic fatigue on the other hand just means fatigue that has become chronic, it is a single symptom that can arises from any number of other conditions such as multiple sclerosis, arthritis or even depression. It seriously doesnt help when articles confuse the two, and causes even more harm when research cohorts confuse the two - the results end up useless and potentially even harmful. Please correct the title so it is clear which of these two things the article is about, is it about the disease ME/CFS as in the NICE Guideline, or is it about the symptom of something else,, chronic fatigue? Thanks ReplyThanks for your helpful comments on our feature.

I have amended the text to clarify this. Dawn Connelly Features editor The Pharmaceutical Journal ReplyIt's blatantly obvious you've never met anyone suffering from CFS/ME. As a sufferer myself, I can honestly say that PEM is NOT EVEN CLOSE to being the main symptom. I thought the article made it clear that the relation between CFS & the scope of the article refers to the symptom of fatigue...Which is BY FAR the main debilitating symptom of the condition. (not just in my opinion, but EVERY person I've ever heard talk about it. I'm a member of a Facebook support group where thousands of CFS sufferers post about their difficulties.)The article even mentioned how many people aren't even aware they experience PEM. I myself have never considered it a symptom due to the unrelenting fatigue I'm already constantly battling.You made it sound as if ME/CFS sufferers primarily experience fatigue post exertion. (Or even that exertion is REQUIRED for fatigue symptoms).... Which is not the case whatsoever. So, if anyone needs to watch out about spreading incorrect info, that's you my friend. The author of this clearly has a deep understanding of how CFS affects the lives of those burdened with this illness. ReplyAs this is primarily an article about about ME/CFS please could you consider making this clear in the title - as many health professionals do not understand that there is a major difference between having ME/CFS and having chronic fatigueChronic fatigue is a very common symptom that occurs in a wide range of medical and mental health conditions. It is not a distinct clinical entityME/CFS is a syndrome that includes activity-related fatigue and post-exterional malaise/symptom exacerbation among its key diagnostic featuresThe new NICE guideline sets out a very clear list of symptoms that are required to make a diagnosis of ME/CFS:All of these symptoms should be present:Debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, is not caused by excessive cognitive, physical, emotional or social exertion, and is not significantly relieved by rest.Post-exertional malaise after activity in which the worsening of symptoms:--- is often delayed in onset by hours or days--- is disproportionate to the activity--- has a prolonged recovery time that may last hours, days, weeks or longer.Unrefreshing sleep or sleep disturbance (or both), which may include:--- feeling exhausted, feeling flu-like and stiff on waking--- broken or shallow sleep, altered sleep pattern or hypersomnia.Cognitive difficulties (sometimes described as 'brain fog'), which may include problems finding words or numbers, difficulty in speaking, slowed responsiveness, short-term memory problems, and difficulty concentrating or multitasking.Dr Charles ShepherdHon Medical Adviser MEA Member of the NICE guideline on ME/CFS committee from 2019 - 2021 ReplyThanks for your helpful comments on our feature.

I have amended the text to clarify this. Dawn Connelly Features editor The Pharmaceutical Journal ReplyI've already commented above to someone who left a similar comment, so if you don't mind pls read that as well.It's really scary to me that PEM is such a huge factor to the medical \"expert\" community... So much so that it's considered a requirement for diagnosis.As I mentioned above, I've never considered \"exertion\" to be much of a factor when considering my symptoms. Sure, when I have to go do things I'm worn down even more afterward, but even if I lay around for days trying to rest up I'm still going to be fatigued!! You could say that I'm only one person & insist most people would consider exertion to play a big role in symptoms, but based off countless posts I've read on the CFS/ME support group Facebook page that's not the case with them either!?!The reason I'm so bothered by this is because it's just one more thing added to the confusion/misinformation surrounding this cursed illness. I'm aware that there's been a severe lack of funding for research which in turn resulted in very little studies being carried out. However the ones that have been done have obviously caused erroneous info to spread throughout the medical community. I'm going to assume that what was actually meant by post exertional malaise was really just trying to say that activity does not help the symptom of fatigue. Another thing that seems to be creating problems with research is how there's no distinction between severity levels. It doesn't seem right, in my opinion ,to group together people who are still able to work and function practically normally and those who can barely leave their bed. I'm not trying to be rude...

If you consider that maybe only 50% people with depression go to the GP, and few of those give enough clues to get accurately diagnosed, then Norfolk's high use is probably only a small percentage of those appropriate for antidepressants. And, despite what NICE says, the evidence for psychological interventions is still poor (the use of waiting list controls instead of placebo is methodologically invalidating) and, although they may be flawed, antidepressants work in most people, are available at a moment's notice and there's no waiting list. I'd say the other areas are under-prescribing rather than those 3 areas over-prescribing. ReplyDo these statistics reflect the way the death certificate is made out?

I'll be teaching Root Cause Analysis applied to medicines error on our PG diploma next month so this is a really useful, contemporary issue to weave in as an example. Could I please encourage some reflection around the terminology and language used though. Firstly, the supply issues are affecting patient adherence not concordance, the term concordance refers to the consultation between the HCP and the patient, not the medicines act. Secondly, whilst I wholly understand the frustrations here, I'd just urge a little reflection around the sentiment that the nurse 'decided' to give the medicines daily not weekly. Whilst I'm sure unintended entirely this holds an implicit accusatory judgement of wrong doing and even infers potential mallice on the nurses part. The nurse misunderstood, got confused, made a human error...for example would hold less accusatory judgement than 'decided'. A really small point but the language that we use with these things really does make quite a difference. ReplyThank you for your comprehensive article on a complex subject.

ReplyFound it a useful resource for use in clinical practice ReplyRecruiting more pharmacists from abroad will not solve the problem it is merely plastering the issue. Perhaps you might need to understand why pharmacists are leaving community In their droves. You fail to mention the workplace conditions in community pharmacy and the rising workloads. It comes to as no surprise that many pharmacist are choosing to leave community and for lower pay but a better work life balance. Until you properly address these issues then you will find it very difficult to recruit and retain pharmacists. ReplyI must take issue with some points made by the author of this article. Although there are no errors in what has been written, it is the omissions that concern me. Firstly, there is no mention that the primary target may not be the metatarsal joints. Secondly, there is an implication that the condition is almost always accompanied by painful swelling of joints and rubra. Any, or all of, these features may be absent. I have a patient who presented with painless swellings in the proximal metacarpal joints of several fingers in both hands. There was limited flexor and extensor movements, and there was no pain associated with these movements, and only two fingers could be fully extended. Blood tests ruled out osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis, and it was only when the patient was tested for blood oxalate that we could confirm a diagnosis of gout with tophi. The clinical example in the article is misleading by failing to mentioning painless presentation, not mentioning the metacarpal joints and that the deformities and that there may not be flare-ups, but still progressive. ReplyHello Henry. I am the senior editor for learning and research at the journal. Thanks very much for your comment.

ReplyAn excellent article to update knowledge on UTIS and also a very good reference source for community pharmacists. SHENU BARCLAY LOCUM PHARMACIST ReplyDavid Ganderton was a very outstanding Fellow of the Society and his death war rants a special tribute of his life and work in pharmacy, which led to his OBE. Please prepare one and publish it in the PJ. ReplyPharmacists in England have, for some time, been able to create their own contribution (vaccination, emergency supply of prescription items, minor illness contributions, etc) to the patient's record and share this with GPs in both England and Wales, (I have no information about Scotland and Northern Ireland). This is 'write' access. What other information would pharmacists wish to share with the wider clinical community? Pharmacists in England also have access to the Summary Care Record, (and the Clinical Portal in Wales), which provides at least a level of 'read' access and is often all an admitting doctor can see when the patient turns up in Accident and Emergency. It would be useful to understand what level of 'read' access pharmacists feel they need to see. Most elements of any 'clinical record' (the hospital progress notes or the GP notes) are not 'shared' with anyone else, as they are largely unstructured and thus hard to share, store and make sense of once they are in a central repository. The Shared Medicines Record in Wales will provide access to up to date information about medicines for all clinicians (I use this term in its widest sense) who care for patients with medicines. Data about radiology or pathology results or pathology laboratory results would be included in the National Data Repository within Wales - and may be included in some ICS-level shared records in England - but are not always easily shared between hospitals and GPs within England, so I'm not sure that community pharmacists are any less well-off (in terms of access to data) than others. This doesn't make it right - merely adds an additional perspective. Data that is important to inform decision making is something that we should certainly press for, but we do need to specify what we wish to see (and why) to facilitate the provision of access. This isn't a 'censorship' issue - more a practical issue about identifying information that could (usefully) be made available. Structured information, such as laboratory results, are easier to share than 'clinical narrative' that is often recorded in 'the notes'. Data included in centralised 'shared records' could be made available to all relevant clinicians, but understanding what is really important will make it easier for those who are working to make this available.

ReplyAgreed but there is also a need for regional / national hubs to be established within the NHS to produce batches of products which are not available from commercial sources.

Sheralyn Bone (Chief Subeditor) ReplyIt's easy to understand how clinicians have become used to a simplified \"serotonin\" explanation of how antidepressants work - the reality is complex and ambiguous and may sound less reassuring to patients. However, many people take medicines when they don't understand how they work. Paracetamol for example. So, perhaps we should focus on finding out what the patient already knows about their medicine, what they want to know and what they're concerned about. Then we can have an individualised (person centred) consultation and come to a shared decision about the optimal course of treatment for that patient. ReplyReform of the generic medicines procurement and supply system is essential for patients, the NHS and the future of our profession. It won't be easy as change is difficult for everyone. ReplyWhere do I find death notices?Ron Medlow ReplyUpdate: we have finished looking into your comment and are satisfied that the article does not need to be updated. ReplyWhilst in the past most closures may have been relatively infrequent and for a matter of hours this is most certainly not my experience in my local area in recent times. Instead of the 7 days one particular Pharmacy was supposed to be open they were only open 3 and these were very much reduced hours. This situation was for weeks, it was further exacerbated by the fact that despite not being open prescriptions were still being downloaded and therefore increasing the workload in GP practices having to re-issue the prescriptions and then try to contact the Pharmacies when they were open to return the originals to the spine for cancellation, this will also have increased the workload in the Pharmacy at an already stressful time. I have to question how much the situation is trying to be downplayed. ReplyRavi Sharma has promised to take the results of the 2021 Workforce Wellbeing survey to 'governments across britain, the NHS and other stakeholders'. Much of the stress affecting pharmacy today is the result of the Society's own policies! Why isn't the Society working to reduce workload and stress by cutting its own ambitious itinery? ReplyI think this article is a helpful summary, and tries to unpack some of the complexities surrounding this issue. I feel some of the responses by clinicians (not in this article!) have been slightly too defensive in saying \"we don't use the chemical imbalance explanation with patients, so this is nothing new\". I think if we are honest, it has previously been used quite commonly as a short-hand explanation (as Nina has mentioned in her comment). We need to reflect on that and refine our communication about antidepressant actions, understanding what each of our patients wants to know and what worries them. My other comment would be that a little more context about lead author Joanna Moncrieff would be relevant beyond describing her as a consultant psychiatrist. She's a prominent and longstanding critic of psychopharmacological approaches to treating mental illness, having published extensively in lay and scientific publications. I think that is relevant when reviewing this umbrella analysis and how it has been promoted. ReplyThe contents of medicines are surely only part of the story. What about the research on laboratory animals that is used to ensure safety, lack of toxicity, and effectiveness? ReplyThank-you for raising the awareness of this ongoing bone health-related issue.

John Edmunds ReplyThis is a great appointment - James is outstanding and I wish him all the best. ReplyUnderstanding historical rivalries is key to understanding the situation we are in today. If they are put to one side it would be a monumental mistake. For example, the PIANA consultation was a total sham, with no indication at the time that it would effectively be a vote on the future of pharmacy. Now that we are living in that future we see the fruit of its misplaced agenda in terms of people leaving the profession, stalled recruitment, workplace pressure, overall dissatisfaction and policy outcomes that, I feel, are not representative of the majority of members. Of course, if our peers are delighted with the current direction of travel, it's no wonder that they want to sweep the past under the carpet. They are, in effect, creating new rivalries in which the wishes of the majority are, again, being swept aside. ReplyOne of the leading researchers in this area is Delia Bishara, a pharmacist. Odd that she is not mentioned. ReplyThat all sounds great but not if you cannot get qualified due to lack of DP to mentor for the 90 hours needed. ReplyI agree.

She speaks of wanting closer relationships with the PSNC (ie contractors) - but is she remotely interested in pharmacist employees?I notice that she makes no mention of the intollerable pressures on pharmacy staff - partly due to what seems to be uncaring decisions made by herself and her colleagues and the PSNC which continue to cause great concern.If there really is a desire to be an ambassador for the membership, please find out what the majority of members, who support the Society with their fees, really want - and please listen and respond.With grateful thanks,Peter.

Those confounding factors make it impossible to draw any valid conclusions about the effect of the treatment.Whilst the report is an interesting single patient observation, the publication as a CPD and learning article \"case study\" raises serious questions about the rigour and validity of the PJ editorial checks. ReplyDear Derek, On behalf of all authors, I would like to thank you for taking your time to provide feedback on our case study. CPRS is a complex condition and patients often struggle to manage their symptoms. This individual patient had a remarkable improvement in her condition, and we believe that this treatment option may be a benefit to other patients suffering from the same condition.

ReplyI was told that back in the early days of the NHS self-employed owner Pharmacists decide to threaten to hand in their NHS dispensing contracts because they were not happy with them. A large multiple Pharmacy company apparently refused to get involved and had the Owner Pharmacists gone ahead with their threat that would have left the Multiple with an open field. Thus, the owner Pharmacists backed down. So, my advice is not to strike, but to inform the Public that Pharmacists could strike as a last resort only and tell the Dept of Health that they need to address this problem as a matter of urgency for Pharmacists and Patients alike. The patients do not deserve another NHS profession to jump on the band waggon of strike action.

It is a balance to try to reach the most disengaged people and pharmacy teams have the privilege to be able to do that. I think the bottom line from this is, spread the word as much as you can. I have known people to use 1ml insulin syringes to withdraw naloxone when no needle was available (because it had been used). I have also heard of nasal administration of the IM solution. Not advocating either approaches, but just to illustrate the ability of people to be innovative in a crisis. What we need of course is more pharmacies supplying naloxone, that is important to have more even availability across the country and national commissioning would be ideal. ReplyYou were doing it for your country - it was an incredibly difficult time when we were all being called upon to work as we hadn't before and the fear and lack of clear guidance resulted in some people behaving badly towards healthcare professionals.

It's brave of you to share your feelings and will help others who may not feel able to do so. Wishing you well ReplyReally interesting! Have had several patients in my community pharmacy who have had issues with certain generic brands of tamoxifen, more than with most other drugs. Definitely worth someone researching properly. ReplyI would not be wanting in any way to knock the desire of hospital staff working under heavy pressure not to continue with real terms pay cuts. However whilst pointing out that the Scottish Offer gives band 9 staff only a 2% rise, you could have mentioned that they are starting from over (if at top of scale of) \u00a3109,000. This is unlikely to garnish much sympathy with staff on a third of that. ReplyAn unbelievably brave account of a tragic situation. But your openness just might prompt someone to reach out for help and support sooner than they might have. The pharmacy profession often put others before themselves, but we need to realise that we need to be well, and functioning to help others.

I agree, this is disputed territory! https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604179/#!po=1.51515 Your point raising this will make an excellent pharmacy student project which I will task some undergraduates to dig into at next opportunity. The pertinent point of the study described was that prescribers selected any pharmaceutical grade, plant-derived, cannabinoid-containing oral product, which might have included CBD, d-9-THC, a combination of CBD/9-d-THC and other cannabinoids - rather than narrowing down. ReplyIt's laudable for the PSNC to request extra funding from the government for directing patients to community pharmacies. But this is not consistent with the regular \"ask your pharmacist\" campaign sponsored by the NPA which just finished a few weeks ago this year, for which we don't request additional remuneration. The profession would achieve more with a clear and coherent strategy from our representatives. ReplyWhile it may be 'laudable' to request extra funding a major role for community pharmacists is to provide advice and support to members of the general public in respect of their health. Why else do some pharmacists choose to become community pharmacists? ReplyAs per current issues regarding cost of living crisis, increase in energy costs and work force issues. I am surprised that PSNC have not come out with a stronger mandate to actually ballot members on 1 day strike action in support of all the other health professions who have decided to strike. This would send a clear message to the Government regarding crisis faced in the Pharmacy sector. ReplyHealthcare professionals have a duty to protect and promote breastfeeding.

There are several world wide expert sources of information based on the knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of medications passing through maternal milk - these have not even been acknowledged by the authors. UKDILAS is part of the UK Medicines Information Service and provides valuable individual data along with detailed factsheets. The Breastfeeding Newtork is run by volunteer pharmacists with a knowledge of drugs in breastmilk and breastfeeding in a service which has no funding. Women with complex medical conditions should be helped to make decisions based on evidence based information as supported by the MHRS consortium Safer Medicines in Breastfeeding and Medication.

It also happens with domestic energy-saving LED bulbs (including the daylight-mimicking ones). OK, it can be partly self-inflicted by young people but if you have ADHD then computer games are a good way to keep occupied. Please don't underrate melatonin. Don't forget that in clinical studies the overall effect may not be overwhelming but, as I'm sure most of you will know from your knowledge of clinical studies, the so-called 'curse of the mean' means significant effects in individuals can be obscured by lack of effect in others.

ReplyWhilst this article does raise the important issue of the data gap which exists for good quality published evidence for use of medicines during breastfeeding, we do not have to wait until this gap is filled before practical and evidence based advice can still be given.Medication use is rarely a reason that breastfeeding cannot go ahead, and any risks can be managed. However, because of the data gap, advice and information sources can conflict with each other.Nevertheless, my colleagues in their replies above, signpost to some very important information sources which are available to navigate this area, which includes the NHS UK Drugs in Lactation Advisory Service (part of the Specialist Pharmacy Service and the UK Medicines Information Network). The Specialist Pharmacy Service includes published advice from UKDILAS on their website and can be contacted regarding medicine use in breastfeeding (0300 770 8564). For more complex cases (including some of the scenarios mentioned in the article), UKDILAS can be contacted directly: https://www.sps.nhs.uk/breastfeeding-medicines-advice-service/Laura Kearney Clinical Lead Pharmacist, UK Drugs In Lactation Advisory Service ReplyThank you for adding these information sources: others are pasted below.Our papers highlight that the 'evidence base' on medicines and breastfeeding is weak: however excellent the compilation of the evidence, there are too few large studies with long-term follow-up [1]. Without these, we shall not know either how isolated the case reports of harm [2] are or which prescription medicines affect breastfeeding rates.We argue that professionals should be proactive in supporting women prescribed long-term medicines to address the increased risk of 'not breastfeeding' and to check infants for any signs of sedation [3], irritability or poor feeding [4,5]. In some less affluent areas, many women simply stop breastfeeding, rather than engage with the excellent helplines available. Active monitoring should be tested in this context.Sources of information include: The British National Formulary (BNF) has information on product licensing https://bnf.nice.org.uk/ as do the Summaries of Product Characteristics Home - electronic medicines compendium (emc) LACTMED: Drugs and lactation database (lactmed).

ReplyDeeply saddened to read this. I came to know Gul as part of the Pharmacy and Public Health Forum. She had such passion for pharmacy and steadfast belief in the profession's potential to improve public health. She expertly invited opinion, probed and challenged fairly. She remains an inspiration, a role model and will be sorely missed. ReplyIncredibly sad to hear of Gul's passing. We worked closely together from 2009 on the Health Living Pharmacy work programme and her passion for pharmacy's role in public health could never be doubted. I last saw Gul at the end of September; she was not feeling herself but keen to celebrate the achievement of others. We had a big hug, which I will remember with affection and true to her essence, Gul was keen to push forward community pharmacy's role in prevention. Mental health, cardiovascular disease and lipid management high on her agenda. More importantly, Gul always had a kind word for everyone, keen to celebrate success in pharmacy but beyond all else was a proud mother, wife and daughter. Gul, you will be so sadly missed in pharmacy and by your family and friends x ReplyGreat article! However, increased adjudication is not met up with increased seats for OSPAP in the universities, resulting into too many students not getting admission and wasting time and money. To put things into perspective, only about 200 applicants could secure a seat in 4 different universities for the year 2023. This will create a backlog of about 500 applicants, with addition to, I think, 700 more applicants for the next year (2024). But the number of OSPAP -offering universities and the number of seats will remain the same. ReplyWhat Pharmaceutical qualifications does Mrs Afua Thompson have? The article doesn't make this clear.

ReplyProfessor Alan Tallentire, Ph.D., F.R.P.S.With much sadness and regret, I must write a few words about my research supervisor, colleague and friend, the late Professor Alan Tallentire. Alan's many academic and industrial achievements and accomplishments have already been enumerated In the Journal, nevertheless some personal reflections are appropriate. I had known Alan since 1968 when I was accepted to his team of radiobiology research students at the Pharmacy Department at Manchester University to work on radiosensitization of bacterial spores. I recall that on joining his small but select group as an enthusiastic young student raring to get started with my research, Alan's first priority was making sure I had suitable \"digs\" and financial support for tuition and subsistence. He was instrumental in helping me obtain a generous research grant from the Society.Alan expected high academic standards from his students, and although highly critical of us in the lab, outside he was always most supportive and displayed pride in his students. He was keen that we present our research progress at academic meetings at every opportunity. I recall that within months after my arrival, he insisted that I should present my preliminary findings at a Spore Group Meeting in Harrogate.He was also enthusiastic about his students acquiring teaching abilities and encouraged our participation as postgraduate tutors in pharmacy lab classes as well giving occasional lectures to the undergraduate pharmacy students. Alan not only taught me good scientific skills, but also how to write \"good science\", something I appreciate to this day. He was meticulous about good, clear and correct English usage and was highly critical of slovenly writing.I often recall his high standards of \"business\" ethics (even in science) when it involved grants, stipends, travel grants and plagiarism. Alan was more than a research supervisor; in fact, he acted as a wonderful father figure to all his students.Alan's many industrial contacts and his promotion of research within industrial pharmacy exemplify his not-living in an \"ivory tower\", yet he fought for high academic standards within the University setting, and was very much against the incorporation of non-academic subjects into the University's curricula (as was becoming fashionable in the early 70's). His scientific development of ISO Standard 11137 (a Standard for radiation dose setting for gamma-ray sterilization) is just one example of applying his research to the industrial setting. His founding of Air Dispersions after his retirement from academia is another.Despite his crowded academic schedule, Alan was a keen sportsman. There was always time for a lunchtime game of squash or evening football game, a round of golf, as well as his unflinching support of Burnley (his home town) and England's cricket team.Having moved to Israel after obtaining my Ph.D., we managed to keep in contact over the years - often when back in Manchester, I would visit him at the University or at Air Dispersions. As I continued in the same field both at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and as an independent consultant on sterilization issues, we would both be invited from time to time as lecturers at International Atomic Energy Agency courses or meet at IAEA headquarters in Vienna. I last spoke to him a couple of years ago at an ISO zoom conference when we even managed to exchange a few jokes and reminiscences.Alan was a most influential and sociable person, and would always find an excuse to take out his students for a beer, as well as inviting us all to his home. I fondly remember the annual dinners at his home supported by Lucy's culinary abilities.My condolences are extended to his dear wife Lucy, and children Lawrence, Iain, David and Caroline and their families, to whom Alan was a wonderful husband and father. He will be sadly missed.Geoffrey P Jacobs Dr Geoffrey P Jacobs Associates Consultants to the Pharmaceutical & Medical Device Industries POB 3304, Jerusalem 9103301, Israel Phones 972 2 6422227 0525509207 Fax: 972 2 6432372 ReplyCompletely agree. Thanks for putting this critical piece out. I'm Ali, co-founder of Chorus Sleep - a non-pharmaceutical for insomnia. Another problem with melatonin (in addition to what you raised here) is the amounts found in over-the-counter supplements can vary DRAMATICALLY, so you don't know what you're getting. I like that you highlighted the importance of changing routine more than using supplements. We conduct a ton of research internally, and as I'm sure many people in this community know, the most impactful thing for improving sleep quality is keeping a consistent wake and bedtime schedule seven days a week.It's also interesting to call out the rise in sleep problems since COVID. I'm not sure of the equivalent number for children, but for adults in the US - before COVID, it was estimated that 66% of adults had trouble sleeping each week, and now that number is estimated to be 86%. Clearly, the rise of stressors in our life, disruption to routine and cues our brain relies on for circadian rhythms (like working from home under fluorescent lights late into the night) is making our sleep worse, which is problematic for mental and physical health.The combination of rising sleep challenges and insufficient solutions is becoming a more dire problem by the day. Thank you for writing about this important topic - education is a critical part of working together to solve it.PS here is my LinkedIn if you ever want to connect directly: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-abramovitz-cook-69458459/ ReplyThis is a good step for pharmacist Independent prescribers, the NHS and the general public who usually could have received appropriate treatment in the pharmacy for many conditions, but have to be sent to their doctors or NHS111 or walk-in centres for the same treatment (becos the pharmacist cannot prescribe the medication needed). ReplyMy question is: how does one receive funding for the course? Is it self funding or it is NHS funded? How does the program help Locum pharmacist to get a DPP? Thanks ReplyI am not representing the course or provider in any context but in response to your first question about funding I see on the website materials somewhere it says that you can self- or NHS-fund the course. Your second question is of course one of the many difficulties practising Pharmacists are facing in accessing these courses in a supported way. There are huge barriers, as many of us know. Not least if you are full time and attempting to try to fit that course in around your working life. This is something that urgently needs to be addressed. Who wouldn't agree that proper support and protected time for most aspects of that course needs to be there and this needs to be addressed at a higher level now. ReplyI applaud this excellent, heartfelt, and candid opinion piece about pharmacy professionals being undervalued and poorly utilised within Primary Care Networks (PCNs) in England. Sadly, I also hear this a lot in my various working arenas, especially when teaching on the national Academic Health Science Network's (AHSN) Polypharmacy Action Learning sets, and have written often, with my colleagues and allies , about why medicines experts are a necessity, not a luxury, in general practice (1-3) As a former consultant pharmacist in acute medical care and medication safety who pivoted to work in primary care in a different NHS region, I would therefore offer the following succinct & pragmatic words of encouragement, about what can be a very harsh and tricky environment, and because, sadly, you can't avoid personalities or politics in any job! 1 Be visible, have a medicines optimisation (MO) vision and share it often so pharmacy, medical, allied health professional, managerial teams are crystal clear what medicines experts can, and shouldn't, do to improve patient care, improve medicines systems and safety, and save GPs time 2 Seek out respected GPs (ideally, but not necessarily, the prescribing lead) and managerial/administrative allies who have influence at a PCN board level as soon as possible once you are clear about the lay of the land. Use your patient honed communication skills to reach mutually beneficial outcomes 3 Ensure all pharmacy professionals document all clinical activities in patients' clinical records and then agree what process and outcome data the PCN wants presented on a monthly or quarterly basis via a PCN wide medicines optimisation meeting 4 Set up the quarterly PCN wide medicines optimisation meeting chaired by the most respected prescriber but including all GP prescribing leads, senior pharmacy professionals, a community pharmacist lead plus Integrated Care Board (ICB) MO and PCN board representatives. Use national comparative MO data sets to help everyone see how well, or not so well, you fare compared with other PCNs in the ICB and understand / \"buy into\" the scale of sub-optimal medicines use 5 Go around obstructive practice / PCN personnel via 1, 2, 3, 4 6 Make sure you have agreed non-clinical sessions for thinking about, and dealing, with 1-5 7 Speak to other Additional Roles Reimbursement Scheme (ARRS) senior staff who may also have similar issues and can also help with 5 8 Ensure you have a personal mentor or coach outside your place of work and tap into any ICB wide pharmacy professional networks (What's App groups and /or more formal groups) for reassurance, belief, and invigoration.

Best wishes, Sophie, senior subeditor ReplyIn Scotland there has been a huge increase in the number of Community Pharmacy Urgent Supplies (CPUS) too. Surgeries are directing patients to the community pharmacy quite often inappropriately. They are not processing repeats quickly enough taking around 7 to 10 working days. I realise this is a service we provide but it is not a repeat prescription service. Patients have been quite aggressive if it is something we cannot do. Obviously we try and help when we can but pharmacy staff are at breaking point . ReplyInteresting article which raises questions over bio equivalence testing for PD medicines ReplyI agree. I looked at bioequivalence requirements a long time ago (2014) & was surprised to see the wide tolerances permitted (80% - 125%) between test & reference product. For narrow therapeutic index meds (decided on a case by case basis) between 90% - 111.11%. This was the Bioequivalence Guidance document published by CHMP/EMA in 2010. I haven't checked to see if this has been updated since, but IMHO the bioequivalence tolerances should be tighter. ReplyJanice Barnes should perhaps understand Community Pharmacy remuneration and Drug Tariff before making a statement like \"legally this brand will be dispensed by pharmacist\" Community Pharmacists will only dispense what they get paid by NHS. Also, some PCN pharmacy advisors tend to muddy the waters by switching to \"cheaper \" brands to justify their existence of making savings. We notice that even in other clinical categories. Paresh Modasia ReplyI stand by my comment that pharmacists must dispense a medication brand if specified by the prescriber on the patient's prescription. If the brand e.g., Sinemet is written on a prescription, the pharmacist must dispense Sinemet unless it is unavailable. If it is unavailable the pharmacist can ask the GP to alter the prescription to a generic product which may be easier to source signpost the patient to another pharmacy that has the branded product in stock in some circumstances where there is an ongoing stock shortage problem, NHSE issues a Serious Shortage Protocol (SSP) then the pharmacist can dispense an alternative product against a branded Rx and endorse accordingly (SSP reference number, date, brand and price of product supplied). Whilst, I fully understand the current cost pressures and funding inequalities within community pharmacy, my role is to manage people with Parkinson's disease who have been stabilised on a specific brand of medication and a change of brand could have deleterious consequences on their symptom control. Janine (not Janice) Barnes ReplyHi PareshI completely agree with the remuneration issue you describe. However, I think Janine is stating that patients ask the prescriber to write the brand on the prescription rather than demand that the a brand is supplied against a generic prescription.

ReplyIf sodium valproate is classified as a special container then it will be dispensed in a full complete pack in the original packaging. Under current legislation I'm not sure how this could be achieved otherwise. At the moment with pack sizes as they are you have to split boxes to dispense the quantity ordered. ReplyExcellent article ReplyNice to hear the word 'causal' being used in relation to clinically relevant adverse drug reactions- something which regulators & clinicians are sometimes reluctant to use. ReplyRegardless of merits the new body might have, in terms of accountability could the PJ explain to whom the new body would be accountable? The Chief Pharmaceutical Officers are all appointed by individual UK nations (ignoring for the moment NI government problems), and are accountable to their respective governments. Is the creation of the new body something that all four nations will need to endorse, or from where else will it it derive its authority. Who will scrutinise its budgets and who will be responsible for ensuring its accounts are audited? ReplyVery wise words once again from the last president of the dual purposed society (regulation and representation) who clearly has not lost site of the opportunity we had for a clinical leadership body. Do enough members want a clinical leadership body or will they wish to remain mired in a watered down PDA (which currently does a fine job of it's own) pursuing perceived grievances and politically correct \"right on\" agendas rather than clinical leadership? There are some fine people on the representative boards but I wonder if there are enough to inspire others to stand? The annual embarrassment of \"angry\" members promising \"Change \" usually directed at pharmacy employers has become cringeworthy. Most, whether elected or not, are seldom heard of again and that is worthy of reflection. Why do they stand and how do we encourage the motivated individuals who have so much to offer in truly leading the profession to stand.As Mr Churton says, we have a big opportunity now. But will individual pharmacists grasp it? I hope so ReplyFantastic piece of work. ReplyViral, congratulations on this amazing achievement. Your work has been an inspiration to your fellow colleagues, not only with the vaccine rollout, but with your broad portfolio of public health work which has enhanced the provision of public health services nationally and strengthened the reputation of the profession. ReplyIt's easier to collect the data on how many women of childbearing age are being prescribed valproate, but not so easy to draw the conclusion that they are not being informed about the risks. The only way to gain this level of insight is through clinical audit. Also with regard to women on valproate who have given birth, is there clinical audit to show whether they were informed about the risks or not before conceiving? How about those patients that choose not to complete the prevent form? I appreciate that more can be done, but need to be careful about assuming it is always due to a failure of healthcare professionals re informing the patient. ReplyEven if the margin per pack calculated is correct (which I highly doubt), the government have not taken into account the spiraling costs of staff, utilities, fuel etc. More smoke & mirrors from this tory cabal. ReplyOK, we are supposed to accept this tosh from an organisation that will not disclose the information it relies on in setting concession prices? Many concession prices are announced having been imposed. That means despite objections from PSNC and evidence from PSNC to the contrary. We cannot believe a word these people say and that has been the case for 6 years. It really is time they were called out by PSNC. \"Profit\"? Gross or net? Justify your findings. ReplyInteresting that their working party includes no pharmacists. That may be a problem. And also their insistence of calling it sodium valproate throughout and not including the names valproic acid and semisodium valproate, which may confuse some people (service users and maybe one or two healthcare professionals and carers) and lead them not to make the connection. ReplyIt is very encouraging and important that the first step is being taken with resolve ReplyThis is a great initiative promoting further integration of care within the system. It would lead to better outcomes and a more effective, efficient and quality care for service users. ReplyGreat article, brief and very useful. ReplyVery good ReplyIt's very interesting that when it becomes apparent that sodium valproate may have a reversible effect on male fertility the CHM advises that there should be greater scrutiny of the way valproate is prescribed and that further risk minimisation measures are required. Scandalous this situation has drag on for years effecting the lives of the pregnant women, the mother of the child and the child itself. ReplyIf a prescription dated February or March is not collected and paid for until after April 1st, will the certificate cover this or only prescriptions dated from April 1st? ReplyOur research on the topic of CRP testing and its relevance in community pharmacy was published in PJ in May 2018. We identified the important benefits of CRP testing in terms of highly significantly reducing unnecessary GP appointments and antibiotic prescribing and presented the work at a number of conferences where our approach was applauded by Lord Jim O'Neill. Unfortunately, as you point out in this article political issues around funding prevented the scheme from being investigated on a larger scale. https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/research/point-of-care-c-reactive-protein-testing-in-community-pharmacy-to-deliver-appropriate-interventions-in-respiratory-tract-infections ReplyBest article I have read so far on the CPhOs appointed chairs report. ReplyChange is a must in modern times. Thoughts about social responsibility have been suppressed in the discussions but for a body with a Royal Charter is important. Reforming the profession as well as the NHS is a necessity as societal, professional and other changes force a review of relevance to the needs of the nation. The article and the report rightly highlight some major challenges for professional leadership bodies, particularly the engagement of younger members, credentialing and career development for pharmacy professionals, and having a more powerful advocate for the value of pharmacy services in improving patient care. To say RPS has been a bit lethargic in these areas is an understatement yet it should be remembered that other national contractor bodies have worked overtime to clip its wings. And, tge NHS itself could have helped. For example, why is CFCP driven by service specifications rather than professional standards? I think the profession would agree that changes are needed. But, my discussions with the members of the profession indicate a divided view about the process. More information about the process is needed for an informed collective view to be formed within the profession. I feel there is a need for position papers written by independent experts to inform and stimulate a debate. Perhaps, RPS and joint chairs would pause and take steps together to publish necessary position papers and allow the profession to discuss, debate and hopefully engage more meaningfully in the change process including the formation of proposed council. Whether a new or a reformed broom is needed requires a discussion but the process must be effective in the end and have general support of the profession.

If not fictitious, would it be possible to confirm that either of the two case studies represented a real scenario involving a real patient? Thank you. ReplyMany thanks for your comment. I am the Senior Editor for Research and Learning who worked with the authors on this article. The case studies are based on a mix of the authors' professional experience combined with elements written to facilitate learning but were not purely based on a specific case or individual. ReplyIs there not scope for the ICB to offer a new contract (in the vicinity of the closure) to provide NHS pharmaceutical services when there is a closure and the remaining local contractors cannot cope with the extra workload ?Surely this is the rational way to ensure that local populations are not left disadvantaged because of commercial decisions made by corporate contractors who want to withdraw from providing NHS services in a locality.It may well be the case that what may not be viable for a large corporate chain could be very viable for a small independent contractor.

Also, in the paragraph under the table \"Thyroid Function rests\". I assume 'tests' would be more appropriate.Is there a role of hypertonic saline? Especially when considering the acuity of hyponatraemia i.e. <48hours vs chronic. ReplyStrange that spironolactone is not mentioned as one of the diuretics that hyponatraemia particularly the higher doses used to treat ascites ReplyHi Kevin, thank you for bringing this to our attention. This was an error and has now been corrected. Best wishes, Sophie, senior subeditor ReplyHi Kevin,Thank you for pointing out the typo's in the table, and elsewhere. This has been kindly addressed by Sophie and the team at the PJ.With regard to your question about use of hypertonic saline, I think it was touched on in the article, albeit not in detail.I would say it does not have a role in routine management of hyponatremia, especially in chronic hyponatremia (>48hrs) because of the risk of ODS. I would say never in the absence of close monitoring - hence why we have advocated it be done at least in a level 2 environment where those facilities are available.However in severe hyponatremia presenting with neurological symptoms, typically acute rather than chronic (although it can be a rapid drop in pre-existing chronic hyponatremia), can be treated if there are adequate monitoring requirements to avoid the risk of over-correction. In these subset of patients, we would give infusions of 150mL 3% hypertonic saline (or equivalent) over 20 mins aiming for a 5mmol/L increase ideally within the first hour, and then not more than 10mmol/L in the first day. This use (i.e. the use of hypertonic saline) is advocated by the European guidelines - found here (https://eje.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/eje/170/3/G1.xml)Hope that was the answer you were looking for.Thanks,Renita ReplyThanks Renita, great article of a complicated subject. Case studies were great. Interesting NEJM released some RCT data from Canada regarding ODS is rare and sodium may not play as big a role as we think https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/EVIDoa2200215. However, in practice I have seen the devastating effects of ODS and hypertonic saline always makes me worry....

The question has been reviewed to ensure that the answers accurately reflect the rashes pictured.Michael Dowdall - Executive Editor, Research & Learning ReplyI am a long lost aquaintenance of my dear dear neighbour and hope to think a friend .I can truly say a piece of my heart is broken to learn of Victor's passing away in 2022.I can believe his achievements and love for his community.I have always treasured one memory. When we were both kids growing up in Leeds Victor's father asked us to dig up the soil in his back garden. Well we decided , after reviewing options ,that a true achievement and more like a real brief was to transform the garden and add a feature of a 5 foot deep crater ,so we could both jump from the neighbours garage into the crater. We dug this crater from Morning until it was to dark to see.Needless to say Victor's father was not as pleased with the result as we were.Think Victor's mother and my mother probably saw the amusing aspect and recognised what we could both achieve. All my heartfelt wishes to Victor's family and friends. I can see that his colleagues truly loved him and still do. He showed that families and communities are important to welfare .There is no doubt that he would love music.Yours Stanislaw Antoni Smigielski BscHons Env Eng Long lost neighbour ReplyI believe there is an error in the second paragraph of this article.

Significant numbers of the public consume these too. ReplyDuring 40 years on the Register I quoted Dr Robinson frequently to my Pre Registration graduates. A fine man! ReplyGreat and informative article ReplyI agree with Mike Hannay's analysis of the proposals for a Government appointed PLC to oversee the leadership of the profession and share his concerns about the government's intentions Royal College status seems the best option but would be very difficult to acheive given that a Government recommendation to the Sovereign is required DVid Carrington ReplySo at last England adopts a system that has demonstrated proven benefits in the devolved administrations as well as evaluating well in pilots ( I took part in one in 2019 which really proved it's worth during the pandemic as so many GPs withdrew F2F services). But notable individuals including Sajid David as then health minister and particularly Thorrun Govind, chair of the English National Board have repeated the assertions that these are worthwhile schemes. And so, thankfully it's come to pass. Particular thanks are due to Janet Morrison and her team at PSNC but I don't think this could have happened without the support of David Webb, the new Chief Pharmaceutical Officer so I put on record my thanks to him.Well done all ReplySo sorry to hear. Carina worked with us closely on medicines safety developing audits for PQS. Her work and impact on patient safety through community pharmacies across England will live on. ReplyExciting times! ReplyPerhaps the same authors would like to comment on remote prescribing via GP practice ? ReplyVery proud of you Katie, well done for your great work xxx ReplyWouldn't it be nice if the various commentators and academics would consider that pharmacists actually have far more training on AMR and its consequences than any of the other prescribing professions? If you consider how many extra hours of pharmacology the average pharmacist graduate has studied it's actually an insult to suggest otherwise. Allowing pharmacists to advise on clinically appropriate use of antibiotics is surely the safest way forward. ReplyI also have reservations about this initiative. It will allow people to obtain antibiotics more easily which will encourage people to present earlier than waiting for a GP appointment. Patients do not always tell the truth about the length of time they have had a condition and they can access pharmacies easily. Perhaps target other initiatives for community pharmacy that don't involve antibiotics. We need fewer prescribers of this group, not more ReplyPilot should also consider other primary care providers (Community Pharmacies) for future proofing concept of testing access through different clinical pathways. ReplyExcellent read and good to hear about TOXBASE. Feel more knowledgeable about poisoning with points to look for ReplyI am saddened to hear of Don's passing. I worked with Don, and found him a kindred spirit when it came to technology. He would implementation various bits of code and programming to make like easier in the pharmacy. Immensely intellectual, and always had time for others, especially if the conversation was around technology.A great loss for the profession. ReplyThis article appears to rely on the misguided contention that Government is intent on undermining the natural order of professional leadership within the profession. Nothing could be further from the truth. The CPhOs are naturally concerned to ensure that leadership of the profession is \"fit for future\" given the professional developments and increasingly clinical roles which members of the profession will discharge over the coming years to the benefit of their patients. Nothing more, nothing less. And certainly not the conspiratorial concerns expressed by Professor Hannay. The independently chaired transitional advisory PLC will be charged with developing and delivering what the profession believes is needed. I emphasise the word \"profession\". Its deliberations and recommendations will be informed and shaped through wide ranging consultation with all interested parties, and should ultimately a Royal College be decided upon it will be established without impediment. Thankfully the recent RPS AGM motion in the authors name, which unbelievably called for the RPS to refrain from all involvement in the PLC, was resolutely defeated. It is perhaps instructive to point out that if the RPS had followed through on its remit to establish itself as the Royal College for the profession (a very clearly articulated \"end game\" when it was established in 2010) then quite probably we would not now be having this discussion. We have \"lost\" at least 5 years in not doing so, and we now need to move with pace and determination to establish what is required. ReplyVery useful article. One of the key missing actions is transparency in the supply chain. It is still unclear how many API manufacturers supply those that assemble the finished products (FDF), and how many FDF manufacturers then supply different generic companies. Without this, it is difficult to predict the potential impact of disruption at each stage. In addition, there is a need to hold larger buffer stocks at each production stage to account for disruptions because pharmaceutical manufacturing is a long game over 5-6 months, and so increases in production will not be available quickly. ReplyIn terms of discussing personal issues which impact on work, confidentially, then please consider contacting Pharmacist Support.(PS) Listening friends who are volunteers with PS are pharmacists and an experienced source of support. ReplyHi PJ team. The NICE guidance actually says \"including, but not limited to tiers 3 and 4\", so from the outset it was viewed as something potentially suitable for Primary Care initiation. ReplyI was very sad to read of David Cousins death. I first met him around 1980 when he came to work for me as a 'Saturday pharmacist' in the pharmacy I then ran on Canvey Island. He was a careful, conscientious pharmacist, someone with whom it was a pleasure to work. However he soon moved on, as did I and the next time I heard of him was in 1990 when I went at Orsett Hospital, where he had almost mythical status among those who had worked with him! We watched his career with interest, and it was no surprise that he achieved the heights he did. My deepest sympathies go to his wife and family. ReplyStating chickenpox is self limiting in adults suggests it is not a real problem. However in many cases it can be an extremely painful and unpleasant experience for many adults and Acyclovir would shorten the period of these symptoms. In my experience most patients do not receive this product in time. No figure for deaths in adults in the UK from chickenpox is available but the U.S estimates 100-150 deaths per annum.A vaccine in the Uk for those adults who have not had chickenpox would seem a worthwhile step forward. ReplyTribute to David Cousin: A Luminary in Pharmacy and Medicine SafetyIt is with profound sadness that I learned of the passing of David Cousin, a figure of unparalleled stature within the world of pharmacy strategy and an extraordinary human being. As the president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB) during our acquaintance, I was immersed in the mission to make Britain the safest place to take medicines. Our paths crossed during this pivotal time, and a shared fervour for medicine safety solidified our professional and personal bond.Our frequent interactions were an exchange of passion and knowledge, from which I gleaned invaluable insights. David's presence was highly influential and impactful, marked by his steadfast leadership both nationally and internationally.A memory that stands out vividly is of a gathering of global experts on medicine safety in Chicago. David's reputation preceded him there as well, with international colleagues expressing their immense respect and admiration for him. His natural wit and kindness added a distinctive charm to his personality, making him a cherished figure among peers and friends.The pharmacy community, as well as his beloved family, has suffered a great loss. But David's legacy, deeply rooted in the realm of medicine safety, continues to thrive, influencing current and future generations in the field.My heartfelt condolences extend to his wife, children, and extended family. David Cousin will be profoundly missed, yet his influence and memory will undeniably persist. ReplyIt was with great sadness that I learned of the death of David Cousins, a pharmacist whose legacy will live on for years to come. Our paths crossed often during his career. I was invited to be the external assessor on the interview panel when he was appointed Chief Pharmacist at Derby Royal Infirmary and many years later, I chaired the interview panel when he was appointed to the National Patient Safety Agency. History tells us that the right person was appointed on both occasions. His contribution to the advancement of hospital pharmacy practice and education and to the improvement in patient safety, through the development of policies and procedures, are recognised across the world. I offer my deepest sympathy to his wife and family. ReplyI first met David while we were doing our pre-reg year in the South-West, with its famed 2-day residential courses. Even then, he was clearly head and shoulders above the rest of us and we could tell he was destined for greatness. Although our paths didn't cross that often after that, we did speak at a few conferences together and were able to chat. I followed his career with interest and, whenever his name was mentioned, it was usually associated with the word \"first\" e.g. first to/first service to:first person. A remarkable man. ReplyAlthough David was well known in the profession I didn't meet him until he joined the NPSA while I was at MHRA and we were both charged with implementing the findings of Organisation With A Memory - a report which sought to reduce the likelihood of medication errors happening in clinical practice. Patient safety was a passion we shared and it was an enormous privilege for me to work with David and to collaborate on the many guidelines he introduced over his years with NPSA. His work has had a lasting impact not just in the UK but across the international community. Patients across the world have much to thank David for and his legacy will be be a bedrock for future work in the area of safe medication practice. David and I also shared a love of music so our interactions also touched on the joy that our music brought to those around us. I am immensely saddened by his passing. My condolences and prayers go to his family. He will be missed by the profession but his influence will certainly continue. Rest in peace David. ReplyI was shocked and saddened to hear of David's passing. David and myself were allocated adjacent benches for practical classes when we commenced at the School of Pharmacy, University of London in October 1972. So commenced a friendship that lasted in to the early stages of our careers in hospital pharmacy.On graduation David returned to his native Devon and myself to Essex. He became frustrated with the limited career progression opportunities in the West Country. After mentioning this to Jeff Watling, then Area Pharmacist for South Essex, David was promptly installed as a Staff Pharmacist at Orsett Hospital, Grays, and Trina followed a few months later to take up a pharmacist technician post at Basildon Hospital.David's pioneering qualities soon became evident. He was in the first cohort of students to graduate from the University of London's Masters in Clinical Pharmacy course based at Northwick Park Hospital. It was no surprise when David moved on to a Principal Pharmacist post at Derby Hospitals but before leaving Essex he was instrumental in founding the Essex Group of the Guild of Hospital Pharmacists (now Guild of Healthcare Pharmacists). His enthusiasm for pharmacy and life in general was always to the fore, and will be missed. ReplySoon after Keith Ridge the former CPhO announced the funding cuts in December 2015 I had a meeting with him. I asked him what he wanted his legacy to be. He had made no secret of his desire to force 3000 pharmacies to close and when asked which ones he wanted to close he said \"the market will decide \". Well now it has. And Keith's legacy is clear. A disaster for our profession. A disaster for patient safety. A disaster for patients and the public. A period of prolonged silence on behalf of the former CPhO would be welcome. But that's probably about as likely as a period of silence from Boris Johnson ReplyWhilst the news that the government is scrapping the plans to make 66 the cut off age for prescription levies is welcome, it really irritates me when the Prescription Charges Coalition claim that people with long term conditions are unable to collect their medication because they can't afford the prescription charges. They are, I feel, being more than a little disingenuous in this as they are, or should be, aware that anyone having to pay prescription charges can get relief from these by buying a pre-payment certificate. Pharmacists are not blameless in this. Anyone collecting more than three items on a regular basis who have to pay, should be counselled on how it would benefit them if they had a pre-payment certificate. The NHS provide these certificates to help people who have long term conditions which aren't eligible for free prescriptions. Yet when the news of raised prescription charges appears on TV, people will spring up claiming they won't be able to afford their medication, and their condition will get worse because of a lack of medication. Where are the pharmacists advising these people? Regards Bob Dunkley Retired Pharmacist ReplyWhat about side effects? Aren't there any significant side effects that can risk patients vitals or is it too safe to use? ReplyLike with any drug this should be discussed with the patient and counselled on it. ReplyMy belated but no less sincere congratulations to Jonathan on receiving this prestigious award. Beyond any doubt a worthy recipient in recognition of his significant contributions to pharmacy practice, an inspirational leader that has been a major influence in key developments in Scotland and beyond for many years.

David was an innovator, a firm believer in evidence as a basis for service development, a strong advocate for patient care at the centre of things, and a thoroughly nice guy... So much of what others were able to achieve was built upon the foundations provided by David. I will miss him and his common sense approach. I offer my deepest sympathy to his family and hope that the profession will continue to benefit from his leadership and example. ReplyAn excellent, thoughtful and analytical article that crystallises so many of the concerns I have felt as I've seen this approach unfold. Thank you for writing and publishing it Rachel. ReplyJohn was the first CAPO of Tayside Health Board. He brought professionalism, an understanding of how Pharmacists could work together in Hospitals and the Community.

Surely, it's time the responsible authorities use their legislative powers to prevent some \"market players\" from \"gaming\" the system and harming the collective. Replynice blog, useful information is shared on this website. Thanks for sharing. ReplyJohn Derrick Appleton died peacefully on 19th June 2023 just six months short of his hundredth birthday and six months after his wife of seventy five years. (He was John to his work colleagues but Derrick to his family). We first met in August 1978 when he gave me the greatest break in my career by appointing me as District Pharmaceutical Officer for Perth and Kinross at the age of twenty eight. Mr. Appleton, I could never bring myself to call him John, was the kindest boss I ever had. He gave me the freedom to make my own decisions but was always there with sound advice and a helping hand to rectify the consequences of the not so sensible ones.A Yorkshireman through and through, he was for several years the Chief Pharmacist at St. James's Hospital in Leeds before moving to Scotland as, up until 1974 and re-organisation of the NHS when he became Chief Administrative Pharmaceutical Officer (CAPO) for Tayside, the Regional Pharmaceutical Officer for Dundee and the East of Scotland, when he helped commission the new Ninewells Hospital in Dundee. John came from a generation of Hospital Pharmacists who were accustomed to having manufacturing as a primary activity and through hard work and cutting edge innovation, commissioned what is now Tayside Pharmaceuticals on the Ninewells Hospital site. At its opening it was the largest hospital pharmacy manufacturing facility in Europe. Sadly, in the early 1980s the role for which it was intended became unfashionable however following collaboration between NHS Tayside and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and a \u00a326m upgrade in 2019 it is still producing \"specials\" for the NHS and stands as a legacy to his vision of over fifty years ago.He was an innovator in other ways, he encouraged the concept of Individual Patient Dispensing and clinical pharmacy when both were in their infancy and on his retirement in 1987 left a Pharmaceutical Service in Tayside that was at the cutting edge of professional practice.John Appleton was one of a kind, he was passionate about the profession, a family man and, above all a gentleman who always encouraged, never belittled, and cared deeply about his fellow man. As a Yorkshireman he spoke his mind, but in a quiet unassuming way. This retired Pharmacist will be forever grateful for his support and friendship and will miss him sorely as will those others who had the privilege to know him and work with him. ReplyExcellent ReplyThe serious shortage protocols were for the chewable form - minimally used and therefore fairly irrelevant to this article. ReplyTest ReplyIn a world where we accept obesity to be a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and t2dm and many other conditions, why is the use of GLP1 agonists for weight loss use being criticised? I think it's shortsighted. Patients with obesity who feel the need to pay privately to access drugs that could help them avoid long term conditions (not to mention improved mental health) are a massive cost-saving for the NHS and should not be made to feel that they are depriving other people of medication. ReplyI have read and found good knowledge. ReplyRetired, I am Deputy Chair of Healthwatch Shropshire which as an organisation which seeks to give voice to the seldom heard. We are aware of the difficulties some individuals face in accessing healthcare. Often these individuals are very reluctant to voice their concerns and it takes a long time to gain their trust. It is a deep seated problem, not only for those who seek to give exemplary healthcare but also those who fail to receive it. ReplyAfter 16 years as Chief Pharmacist, Keith Ridge's chickens are coming home to roost. He can't say that he wasn't warned ReplyHow about EPAs for newly qualified independent prescribers?? ReplyI'm not clear how they differ from competencies? There are competencies for NMPs... ReplyExcellent article. The growth in private ADHD clinics is also driving this, but these can only thrive if the NHS isn't willing or able to provide diagnosis and treatment. ReplyIt IS a good article but there's no consideration given to root cause analysis. WHY are we witnessing this massive growth not just in ADHD but in all forms of mental health problems. I've become fascinated by the link between diet and cardio metabolic health and the link between what we eat and brain function. Could it all be down to the role of the mitochondria? Prof Chris Palmer certainly thinks so and I can't recommend his book Brain Energy too highly ReplyThe increase is not only happening in the UK but also most part of the world. see: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00509-0/fulltextIndeed not only ADHD treatment increase but also almost all psychotropic drugs in different part of the world. See: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(21)00292-3/fulltextIt is probably a combination of better recognition, diagnosis and willingness to prescribe and take. ReplySad news. Robert was my final year project tutor at Portsmouth. A dedicated and committed teacher, and a true gent. ReplyThat's really helpful, Hermant. I would add that we should consider the investment in patient health as part of the calculation of cost effectiveness. If we avoid future NHS/healthcare interventions, and support people to maintain/gain quality of life, not only will that contribute to patient experience, it also contributes to the wider economic environment. For example, perhaps it can allow people to continue working, or return to work. When you state medications should be delivered in the 'right manner', I would expand that to say - \" in a way that they can fit into their lifestyle, and obtain the maximum benefit from\" - it's important they *can* adhere to treatment, as well. K ReplyWorrying. So many things could and will go wrong. Throw in bad actors and the dangers could be immense. International regulation and expert overseeing is needed early days or sleepwalking into a real mess could ensue. ReplyI have been contacted by my GP practice who have told me they are given Flu injections in September, but would not take bookings for the Covid boosters! ReplyHow long before the expensive pharmacists will be replaced completely by technicians? ReplyShould the position come that pharmacy technicians can undertake the roles currently delivered by pharmacists, then I would expect them to be renumerated at a similar rate, based on the responsibility and liability they would be undertaking. That would seem fair to me, and I would hope they wouldn't undervalue that position. ReplyI imagine that pharmacy technicians will become just as expensive if this proposed action is taken. ReplyVery interesting article. Thank you PJ ReplyThe best solution is finding another way other than doing OSPAP to evaluate overseas pharmacists as the way GPs are evaluated. If it is impossible, we should consider that there aren't enough places in 4 universities providing OSPAP course and especially for pharmacists who are already living in the north ,Sunderland is only option to do OSPAP. If some universities like Durham and Newcastle can provide this course in the North it would be great. another problem is that the expiry date of adjudication letters is limited and it should be expanded for at least 5 years. ReplyIt would seem fair to me that pharmacy technicians took a pharmacy degree before embarking on pharmacists' responsibilities. ReplyWhat a dedication. ReplyMy husband Parkinson's disease started nearly 4 years ago, at age 52. He had a stooped posture, tremors, muscle stiffness, horrible driving skills, and slow movement. He was placed on Sinemet 50/200 at night for 7 months and then Sifrol and rotigotine were introduced which replaced the Sinemet but he had to stop due to side effects. He started having hallucinations, lost touch with reality. Suspecting it was the medications I took him off the Siferol (with the doctor's knowledge) In March this year his primary physician suggested we started him on Natural Herbs Centre ( Naturalherbscentre. com ) Ayurveda Parkinson's Protocol which eased his anxiety a bit, i'm happy to report this PD Ayurvedic treatment worked very effectively. His Parkinson's is totally under control, he had a total decline in symptoms, the tremors, shaking, stiffness, slow movement and speech problems stopped. Reply Cancel replyLogged in as . Log out?
