One very topical example is the discus - sion on Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi). An increased risk of severe infections, major adverse cardiovascu - lar events (MACE), malignant diseases, thromboses and overall mortality have been observed with JAKis. An article in this edition looks at risk minimisation and communication measures for JAKis by the US FDA, EMA and Swissmedic, while a second covers the dose-response relationship of JAKis. New data on the risk profile of a medicinal prod - uct can be collected and evaluated by analysing spontaneous case reports. The possible associa - tion multifocal leukoencephalopathy is elucidated in one article, while another outlines a university hospital's experience of using remdesivir in myas - thenia gravis. In exposed groups such as pregnant women in particular, current findings play an important role. Spontaneous reports on exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors in the perinatal period and the possible occurrence of pregnancy-related out - comes were evaluated. Regarding vaccines, adverse events following immunization (AEFI) with COVID-19 vaccines contin - ue to be monitored even after the large-scale vac - cination campaigns. Swissmedic evaluated reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination in elderly patients as well as reports of suspected AEFI following vaccination with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. One article also focuses on AEFI reports after monkeypox vaccination in Switzerland. In haemovigilance, both incorrect blood compo - nent transfused (IBCT) incidents and near-misses (errors discovered before transfusion) are report - ed and analysed to improve transfusion safety. This approach is described in the second part of our haemovigilance series. In order to continue to receive up-to-date infor - mation on the safety of medicinal products, we ask you to submit adverse drug reaction (ADR), AEFI and haemovigilance reports to Swissmedic. You can find all information on submitting reports at www.swissmedic.ch . With the present 30th edition of Swissmedic Vig - ilance News, we have also decided to refresh the layout according to contemporary criteria. We hope you enjoy reading our \"relaunched\" pub - lication.

Therefore, blockade of the im - mune checkpoints programmed cell death-1 protein (PD-1), its ligands (programmed cell death-ligand 1 cytotoxic T-lympho - cyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) could provoke an immune response against the foetus (3). Preclinical studies showed that using ICIs in pregnancy increas - es the risk of foetal death (4). Accordingly, ICIs are not recommended in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential (if not using effective con - traception) (5). However, some clinical cases of ICI exposure before, at or after conception have been reported showing favourable foetal outcomes with - out developmental abnormalities (6-17) . Considering the inherent challenges and limitations of pregnancy research, including ethical issues re - garding inclusion in clinical trials, large-scale spon - taneous reporting systems represent a privileged source of real-world data to investigate drug safety in pregnancy. To gain further insight into ICI safety in pregnancy, Noseda R et al. (18) queried VigiBase\u00ae, the World Health Organization's (WHO) global pharmacovig - ilance database, and described the largest series of spontaneous safety reports from clinical practice to date referring to ICI exposure during the peri-preg - nancy period and the possible occurrence of preg - nancy-related outcomes. Methods This study used disproportionality analysis along - side a case-by-case evaluation using de-duplicated safety reports gathered in the VigiBase\u00ae database from its inception until 30 April 2022. This comple - mentary design was implemented to provide an exhaustive pharmacovigilance perspective. Drugs of interest were ICIs reported as suspected and selected as active ingredients among ipilimum - ab, were pregnancy-related outcomes retrieved using the standardised query \"pregnancy and neonatal topics\" available through the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA\u00ae), on which VigiBase\u00ae relies. After selec - tion, safety reports were manually revised to ascer - tain ICI exposure during the peri-pregnancy period and/or the reporting of specific pregnancy-related outcomes. Safety reports included in the study co - hort were described in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics. Pregnancy-related outcomes were classified into maternal and foetal/neonatal. To detect potential safety signals, disproportional - ity analyses (raw and on the subgroup of safety re - ports concerning women aged 20-44 years - based on the characteristics of the study cohort) were per - formed for pregnancy-related outcomes reported in at least five of the included safety reports. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was computed and con - sidered to be significant when the lower limit of its 95% confidence interval (CI) was > 1. Three groups of safety reports were used as comparators: (i) the entire database, (ii) only safety reports suspecting antineoplastic agents other than ICIs to control con - founding by indication, and (iii) only safety reports suspecting antineoplastic agents other than ICIs and submitted after 2011 (when the first-in-class ICI ipilimumab received marketing authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration).6 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023Results As of 30 April 2022, 103 out of 123,289 safety re - ports with ICIs as suspected drugs were included in the study cohort. 65 (63.1%) safety reports came from the United States of America, 2 (1.9%) came from Switzerland. In 86 (83.5%) safety reports, the reporter was a healthcare professional whilst in 15 (14.6%) it was the patient/consumer. The medi - an age was 32 years (ranging from 20 to 44 years, n = 45), maternal exposure to ICIs occurred more frequently during pregnancy (n = 77, 74.8%), the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway was the target of ICI treat - ment in most of the safety reports (n = 76, 73.8%) and malignant melanoma was the most common underlying cancer type, affecting 28 (27.2%) pa - tients from the study cohort.

No patterns of major birth defects or of specific foetal/neonatal immune-related adverse events were found. Disproportionality analyses In raw disproportionality analyses for spontaneous abortion, foetal growth restriction and prematu - rity, there were no signals of disproportionate re - porting with ICIs for any of the three predefined comparator groups (Figure 1) . In subgroup dispro - portionality analyses in women aged 20-44 years, no safety signals were found for either spontane - ous abortion or prematurity, regardless of the com - parator group used (Figure 1) . Discussion This pharmacovigilance study in VigiBase\u00ae provid - ed the largest series of cases to date referring to ICI exposure during the peri-pregnancy period and reporting pregnancy-related outcomes. In line with previously published single clinical cases (6-17) , it found no specific patterns of maternal, foetal, or neonatal toxicity. No signal of disproportionate reporting was detected for spontaneous abortion, foetal growth restriction or prematurity with ICIs. Notably, most of the safety reports included in the present study were from healthcare professionals, suggesting a growing awareness of the potential negative effects of ICI use in pregnant women or those of childbearing age. Moreover, slightly less than half of the safety reports referred to ICI ex - posure during the peri-pregnancy period without mentioning any type of pregnancy-related out - comes. This finding might further support the fact that among healthcare professionals, the use of ICIs during the peri-pregnancy period, whenever chosen, remains questionable and prompts them to spontaneously report their off-label use, even in the absence of pregnancy complications. VigiBase\u00ae as a data source allowed identification and description of 56 patients who reported a cific maternal pregnancy complications occurred in three cases and included pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count) with a placental disorder, and a case of placental infarction. Among 32 more gen - eral maternal outcomes, no specific toxicity pat - terns were observed. Regarding foetal/neonatal 8 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023total of 104 pregnancy-related outcomes, a far greater number than that of clinical cases pub - lished to date concerning exposure to ICIs in preg - nancy (6-17) . Despite a lack of clinical details im - portant for the comprehensive characterisation of ICI toxicity in pregnancy, VigiBase\u00ae collects a high number of safety reports that can be exploited for data mining. Indeed, nowadays, pharmacovigilance studies using spontaneous reporting databases to investigate drug safety in pregnancy by means of disproportionality approaches are increasing. How - ever, VigiBase\u00ae suffers from the main drawbacks of spontaneous reporting systems, including over- and under-reporting, partial and missing information, the impossibility of firmly inferring causality, a lack of information on differential diagnoses and, as far as the aim of this specific study is concerned, a lack of information on the follow-up of children. Considering the increasing use of ICIs, not least in pregnant women and women of childbearing po - tential, continuous surveillance by clinicians and pharmacovigilance experts of large-scale sponta - neous reporting systems is warranted. As dispro - portionality analyses rely on the number of safety reports gathered in the spontaneous reporting sys - tem, the results from these analyses for the preg - nancy-related outcome(s) of interest might change over time, thus making reassessment of the ICI safety profile in the peri-pregnancy period of the utmost importance. Moreover, pharmacoepidemi - ological studies on different sources of real-world evidence, such as birth records, are needed to pre - cisely assess the exact timing of exposure to ICIs during the peri-pregnancy period and to Function of PD-L1 in Health and Immune-Related Diseases.

The majority of PML cases occur in patients co-infected with HIV. Other risk factors include haematological malignancies, autoimmune diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis) or im - munosuppression following solid organ transplan - tation. Some medications have been associated with an increased risk of PML, such as B-cell deplet - ing agents (rituximab) and antago For other drugs, the associa tion with PML is not clearly established (1-4) . Cases of drug-induced PML most often manifest with motor and/or cognitive deficits with radiological lesions predominantly in the frontal and parietal regions (5). In oncological settings, drug-induced PML occurs on average 14 months after the intro - duction of the offending drug (5). We report on a patient who developed PML with likely involve - ment of ibrutinib and venetoclax in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Case report A patient in his seventies with CLL diagnosed in 2014 was considered in remission after 15 cycles of rituximab and bendamustine (last administra - tion in September mg 1x/d and 1x/d were started in January 2022. The standard ibrutinib dosage was 420 mg 1x/d, but the patient received a lower dose due to a drug-drug interaction between ibrutinib and CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e. amiodarone and dilti - azem for atrial flutter). Other prescribed drugs were apixaban, olmesartan and cholecalciferol/calcium. In December 2022, a rapid onset of cog - nitive impairment with memory loss and executive dysfunction was reported. In mid-February, the pa - tient was admitted for investigation of an acute motor and hemineglect syndrome. Vital parame - ters upon admission: blood pressure mmHg, heart 67 bpm, ambient O2 saturation 95%, body temperature 36.8\u00b0C. During the neurologi - cal examination, the patient was disoriented with right multimodal hemineglect, labial ptosis, right limb droop and Babinski sign on the right foot. Laboratory tests showed stable renal function with a creatinine level of 136 \u00b5mol/l (N 62-106 \u00b5mol/l) and liver parameters, including transaminases, within normal limits. A complete blood count showed no abnormalities associated with neutro - phils. Regarding lymphocyte count: B cells were at (N 170-880 cells/mm3). HIV serology was negative. were with PML features: multifocal pe - riventricular and subcortical areas - signal predominating in the bilateral fronto-pa - rieto-occipital regions were reported. A lumbar puncture revealed elevated proteins at 707 mg/l (N 150-460 mg/l) but glucose and lactates remained in the normal range. There were no tumour cells identified on cytology and the cellularity was nor - mal. CSF microbiology was positive for JC polyo - mavirus (PCR with 900 copies/mL). Reactivation of the JC virus was attributed to the immunosup - pression associated with CLL and to the treatment with venetoclax and ibrutinib (both of which were stopped). The disease course was unfavourable and palliative care was initiated. The patient died four weeks after admission.11 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023Discussion The patient developed PML in the context of CLL one year after starting treatment with venetoclax and ibrutinib. Venetoclax, as navitoclax, is BCL-2 (B-Cell Lympho - ma): inhibits protein, resulting in mito - chondrial cell apoptosis by activation of caspases, a family of protease enzymes playing essential roles in programmed cell death. The immunosuppres - sive effect of venetoclax is ultimately due to the protracted cytopenias (6). Neutropenia and lym - phopenia with respiratory and urinary tract infec - tions are common adverse events. However, oppor - tunistic infections (such as reactivation of JC virus) are not reported as adverse drug effects, even in the long term. In the European Medicines Agen - cy database, there are five cases of PML in asso - ciation with venetoclax. According to a review by the European Society of Infectious Diseases, 3.6% of patients taking venetoclax develop opportunis - tic infections (including aspergillosis, pneumocyst - is, nocardiosis, toxoplasmosis). Yet the authors do not report an association between venetoclax and PML (7). To our knowledge, there is no case report describing an association between venetoclax and PML. By contrast, one case report mentioned a pa - tient with CLL who survived PML. Approximately seven years after the diagnosis of PML, he present - ed with a recurrence of his malignancy. Treatment with venetoclax was introduced without reactiva - tion of JC virus (8). Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine ki - nase the pathogenesis of several B-cell malignancies. BTK plays a role in the proliferation, survival and differentiation of B cells. The occurrence of PML during ibrutinib treatment is labelled in the product information. In the Eu - ropean Medicines Agency database, there are cur - rently 31 cases of PML in association with ibrutin - ib. In the literature, ibrutinib has been associated with an increased risk of PML. A study based on FDA post-marketing data observed the occurrence of PML with different biological agents and cancer treatments. For ibrutinib, they identified 10 cases of PML (9). One case series described five patients with CLL who died of PML after receiving ibrutinib (n = 1), ibrutinib + rituximab (n = 3), or ibru- tinib + rituximab + bendamustine (n = 1). The medi - an duration of ibrutinib treatment was 11 months (range: 1.5-24 months), and PML developed on average eight years after the diagnosis of CLL (range: 3-17 years) (10). The mechanism suggested to explain the association between PML and ibruti - nib is the inhibition of B-cell proliferation by ibru - tinib. B cells and the humoral immune response are thought to play a crucial role in the control of JC virus replication (interaction between B and T cells for the antiviral response) (5, 11) . In the present case, the last administration of ritux - imab and bendamustine was in September 2019. Their involvement in the occurrence of PML seems unlikely. The majority of PML cases with rituximab develop within two years of starting the treat - ment (12). The association between bendamustine and PML has not been established in the literature, and the long delay since the last administration makes this drug causality very unlikely (13-14) . About 10-20% of PML cases occurred in haematological malignancies, most commonly non-Hodgkin lymphoma and CLL (1, 3) . The treat - ments administered are often confounding factors in explaining the occurrence of PML in haematolog - ical malignancy. However, a case report described a case of a patient who was diagnosed with CLL and PML simultaneously, i.e. neither with prior chemo - therapy nor immunosuppressive therapy (15). Conclusion PML is a rare disease occurring mainly in the con - text of specific immunosuppressive conditions, such as HIV or with VLA4-integrin antagonists. In this case presentation, venetoclax and ibrutinib, which are reported only in a few case reports, could be suspected as causative agents. As PML is a very rare event, hindsight is still too limited to exclude or infer a formal causal relationship for either drug (ibrutinib approved by the FDA since 2013 and venetoclax approved by the FDA since 2016). None - theless, the increasingly common combination of a selective BCL-2 inhibitor and a BTK inhibitor should make us vigilant about their contributory role in the occurrence of PML.12 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023References (1) Cortese I, Reich DS, Nath A.

It is author - ised for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), specifically in those patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen, or in those patients who do not require supplemental oxygen but who are at increased risk of progressing to a severe form of the disease, for example when nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid\u00ae) is contraindicated due to major drug interactions. For patients with severe COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a conditional recommendation in favour of the administration of remdesivir, since it may reduce mortality and probably reduces the need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation. In the clinical trials, remdesivir was well tolerated and adverse events were rare. In patients with non-se - vere COVID-19 but who are at high risk of hospital - isation, the WHO has likewise issued a conditional recommendation in favour of remdesivir (2). Since it was only recently launched on the market, limited experience is available to date concerning its safety profile in certain subpopulations, for ex - ample in pregnant women, children or adults suf - fering from certain comorbidities: end-stage renal disease with or without dialysis, myasthenia gravis. In this context, post-marketing surveillance can provide data concerning possible risks. The aim of this article is to report our clinical experience on the use of remdesivir in adult patients suffering from myasthenia gravis (MG). Methodology We reviewed the medical records of all patients with known MG whose cases were submitted to the Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology Division for an opinion concerning the introduction of rem - desivir. Results We were asked for our opinion concerning the in - troduction of remdesivir for a total of six patients. One of the patients was excluded from our anal - ysis because she had not received remdesivir due to low kidney function. Moreover, MG was mere - ly suspected and not confirmed in this patient. Finally, five patients (four men, one woman) with known MG aged between 27 and 84 had received remdesivir. The duration of treatment was from 3 to 5 days depending on the indication. All had also received a corticosteroid. None of these five patients experienced a deterioration in their MG after taking the remdesivir. Discussion MG is an autoimmune disease in which antibodies bind to acetylcholine receptors or to functionally related molecules in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, causing the skeletal muscles to weaken. This weakness may be general - ised or localised and almost always affects the ocu - lar muscles, with diplopia and ptosis. The prevalence of MG is 150 to 250 cases per million persons (3). Certain drugs may have an adverse impact, either by triggering or by exacerbating MG. Those that cause MG de novo produce an autoimmune reac - tion against the neuromuscular junction and pri - marily include checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine 14 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023kinase inhibitors. Drugs that alter neuromuscular transmission can aggravate the symptoms of the disease and primarily include certain antibiotics (macrolides, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, penicillins), curare and class IA antiarrhythmic agents. Cases of aggravation of MG have been reported for numerous other drugs in the form of case reports, and those particularly implicated are statins, beta blockers, calcium antagonists and lithium (4). We report our clinical experience with the use of remdesivir in five patients with MG without any worsening of their underlying disease. MG is not mentioned in the contraindications listed in the Information for healthcare professionals for remdesivir (5, 6) . Although experience is still limited concerning this recent drug, its mechanism of action does not suggest that it affects acetylcho - line and its receptors (7). The literature reports five cases of MG patients in whom remdesivir was used (7-9) . The first series describes the use of remdesivir in three patients without any resulting deterioration in their myasthenia (7). One case report describes a patient admitted for SARS-Cov2 infection with a simultaneous exacerbation of his MG. He was treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir, supplemented by plasmapheresis, with a positive clinical outcome (8). The last case describes a young female patient admitted with a diagnosis of MG, who was subsequently found to have SARS-Cov2 infection, requiring the administration of dexa - methasone and remdesivir, with a good clinical response (9). In a cohort of 93 patients with MG and infected with SARS-CoV-2, 72 were treated with an acetyl - cholinesterase inhibitor and a - phenolate mofetil, cyclosporine or tacrolimus) and six with a biological agent, including four who re - ceived rituximab. Only 14 (15%) of the patients ex - perienced a worsening of their MG following the infection with SARS-CoV-2 (three of these patients died and all three had received rituximab). The treatments of remdesivir, favipiravir and convales - cent plasma taken for the infection were not asso - ciated with an exacerbation of the MG (10).In a review of the literature on COVID-19 treat - ments administered to patients with MG, remdesi - vir was considered to be safe in the absence of any evidence of adverse effects on the MG (11). According to the health authorities in the United Kingdom (NHS - National Health Service), remdesi - vir may be prescribed for patients with a neurolog - ical disorder such as MG (12). The WHO global database of adverse drug reac - tions does not report any cases of a deterioration of MG for remdesivir. Two cases of myasthenia cri - sis have been reported (probably the same patient and therefore a duplicate entry), out of a total of 10,706 reported potential side effects of this drug. No further details are available since this was a spontaneous report without any clinical details. Conclusion When remdesivir was launched on the market, the experience with its use in certain subpopulations, including MG patients, was still lacking. In our hospital, this drug has been used in five patients known to have MG without any mention in their medical records of a subsequent deterioration of the underlying disease. Therefore, our clinical ex - perience and the literature data are reassuring concerning the possibility of using this drug in pa - tients with MG when there is a proven indication.15 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023References (1) Humeniuk R, Mathias A, Kirby BJ, 2016;375(26):2570-81.

JAK inhibitors (JAKi) are used for multi - ple inflammatory and oncological disorders, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, immune-mediated essential thrombocythaemia, and more re - cently graft versus host disease (GvHD). In Switzer - land, the first JAKi to be approved were ruxolitinib (Jakavi\u00ae, 2012) and tofacitinib (Xeljanz\u00ae, 2013). The type of JAKi affinity to the receptor plays a key role in the drug properties and disease targets in these highly selective medications. All JAKi for chronic inflammatory diseases inhibit, at least part - ly, the JAK1 isoform: this specific inhibition could be associated with a class effect with respect to their safety (1). The rapid rate of resynthesis (2-4h) for the isoforms JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 impacts the spectrum of JAKi characteristics and their duration of action (2). Inhi - bition of one or more JAK isomers results in a wide range of biological responses (i.e., desired and un - toward effects). The pharmacokinetics of JAKi, such as the biologi - cal half-life, peak concentrations, the time to reach the maximum concentration at the target site, and the elimination pathways, as well as the binding type and the affinity to the four isomers, affect their pharmacodynamics. JAKi represent a chemi - cally heterogenous group of medications with var - pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic pat -terns of physiological actions: concentration-effect drug reaction (ADR) re - lationships are substance-specific. Efficacy and ADR depend essentially on the concentration-response relationship to adjust the drug dosage and drive concentrations close to target within therapeutic ranges. For instance, an association between plas - ma exposures and efficacy was observed in ulcera - tive colitis and rheumatoid arthritis patients treat - ed with upadacitinib. Similar relationships were seen for serious infections, liver transaminase or CPK elevation, lymphopenia, and decrease in (3-5) . Novel mechanisms of immunosuppression inevita - bly entail a risk of either insufficient efficacy or tox - ic effects, raising dosage optimisation concerns for a large array of non-standard patients. Safety issues of JAKi (e.g. increase in cardiovascular events, can - cers, opportunistic infections, reactivation of herpes zoster, chronic viral hepatitis infections, and latent tuberculosis) are discussed in a separate article in the newsletter. Formatted standard-of-care to patients with straightforward oral administration is the rule to streamline immunosuppressive treatments, regard - less of age, gender, pharmacogenetic profile, drug- drug interactions or disease-induced metabolic characteris - tics of JAKi and drug-drug interactions may affect the effectiveness and tolerability. In particular, the cytochromes P450 (CYP), whose activity is strong - ly influenced by genetic polymorphism and drug- drug interactions (induction or inhibition), play a critical role in the biotransformation of JAKi to active metabolites considered as active compounds. Pharmacokinetic characteristics of JAKi are summa - rised in Table 1 .17 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023MoleculeDrug nameIndications Half-life Dosage Pharmacokinetic CYP2C9 Active metabolites (renal elimination) Baricitinib Olumiant\u00ae RA, AD Swissmedic, FDA : COVID-19 FDA, EMA : alopecia areata Clinical studies : SLE, lupus nephritis, type I abetes, Substrate: CYP3A4, P-gp (minor) Fedratinib Inrebic\u00ae MF Clinical acute - loid leukaemia, essential thrombocythaemia, chro - nic beryllium disease 41 h Depends on the platelet count and adverse effects: Platelets 50 x 109/l :400 mg QD CAR-T cell therapy-related cytoki - ne release syndrome, COVID-19, leu - kaemia, 200,000/mm3: MF: 20 mg mg BID Platelets 100,000- 200,000/ mm3 MF: 15 BID PV: 10 mg Platelets 50,000- 100,000/mm3 MF: max. 10 mg BID PV: 5 mg BID Elimination: mainly hepatic (<1% renal in unchanged form) Substrate: CYP3A4 (major) Active metabolites (renal elimination)Table 1.

The drug actionability is enhanced by using dif - ferent doses for different indications in a wide range of diseases in rheumatology, dermatolo - gy, or upad - acitinib indications have been extended to include gastroenterology for inflammatory bowel diseas - es. In clinical trials, Crohn's disease patients treat - ed with upadacitinib were within off-label indica - tions, with a tripling of the dose for the induction phase (45 mg/d) and a doubling of the dose for the maintenance phase (30 mg/d) compared to the dose administered for e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis (15 mg/d) (8, 9) . However, tofac - itinib and filgotinib (approved in the EU but not in Switzerland) dosages were not sufficiently high and failed in pivotal clinical trials for the treat - ment of Crohn's disease (phase 3), in contrast to ulcerative colitis, which requires lower doses (10 mg BID and 200 mg/day, respectively, in induction therapy) (10, 11) . The difference in optimal dos - es between these patient populations with IBD is related to the difference in the exposure-response relationship and the expected risk-benefit trade- off (5). Considering the inhomogeneous pharmacoki - netic characteristics and the variations in dosage that significantly impact biological effects, JAKi are drug candidates that would require individu - al dose adjustment to optimise their effectiveness and safety profiles. Thus, dose-dependent efficacy and tolerability issues could be addressed by treat - ment individualisation approaches, such as thera - peutic drug monitoring (TDM), using blood con - centration as a marker for drug exposure-response optimisation (12). In summary, JAKi are subject to a wide range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g. drug-drug inter - actions, patient characteristics, including pharma - cogenetic profile) that influence their disease-spe - cific efficacy and tolerability. Recently, clinical trials have provided new relevant information on 19 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023the crucial role of concentration-response relation - ships to balance the expected risk-benefit ratios. Using therapeutic drug monitoring for treatment individualisation, concentration-effect and con - centration-tolerability relationships could consti - tute a new clinical marker to gain insight into the effectiveness and safety issues of JAKi.

The approved indications vary depending on the me - dicinal product as described in the respective infor - mation for healthcare professionals. Two other JAKi, Jakavi\u00ae (ruxolitinib) and Inrebic\u00ae (fedratinib), are licensed for the treatment of mye - loproliferative disorders and are not the subject of this review.Increased risk of serious infections, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), malignancies, thrombosis, and all-cause mortality with Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) for chronic inflammatory diseases Risk minimisation measures and risk communication by the FDA, EMA and Swissmedic Prof. Oliver Wildner, MD Safety of Medicines Division, Swissmedic Key messages 1.There is an increased risk of serious infections, MACE, malignancies, thrombosis and all- cause mortality with JAKi for chronic inflammatory diseases compared to TNFi (1). 2.The above AESIs are considered a class effect of JAKi for chronic inflammatory diseases (2). 3.JAKi have a dose-dependent toxicity (1). 4.There was no dose-dependent difference in the clinical efficacy of tofacitinib in RA (1). For safety, the lowest licensed/effective dose of JAKi for the indication should be used. 5.The efficacy of TNFi was similar to that of JAKi (1). Individual risk factors should be consid - ered before starting treatment with JAKi. 6.JAKi, unlike TNFi, are administered orally, which might be relevant for the treatment of advanced RA. 7.The risk minimisation measures and risk communication by the FDA, EMA and Swissmedic for JAKi for chronic inflammatory diseases were similar, with the exception of restriction of the indication to post-TNFi and dose adaptation for certain patient groups with risk factors.21 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023Cytokines are key drivers of inflammation in RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases. JAKi target and block cytokine signalling mediated by the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, thereby regu - lating the immune response and cell growth (3). JAKi inhibit the four JAK isoforms abrocitinib (JAK1) However, all JAKi that are the subject of this re - view inhibit JAK1, which is presumed to be a key target for RA and other inflammatory diseases since it associates with receptors for c cytokines, interferons, type II cytokine receptors (e.g. IL- 6) and other interleukins (5). The effects of the JAKi discussed on cytokine-receptor signalling are simi - lar when compared at clinically effective doses for RA treatment (6, 7) . Increased cholesterol levels and malignancies in the clinical development programme with tofacitinib prompted the FDA to mandate a large, long-run - ning post-approval randomised controlled study (A3921133; ORAL Surveillance) (1). This study enrolled 4,362 patients with RA 50 years of age on MTX with at least one cardiovascular risk factor. Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive 5 or 10 mg tofacitinib BID or tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi). The FDA pre-specified 1,500 pa - tients with a follow-up of 3 years, 103 MACE and 138 malignancies (excl. non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), incidence of which was already known to be increased with tofacitinib). The study had the following endpoints:i.The efficacy of JAKi and TNFi was similar, assessed as improvements in SDAI and HAQ- DI scores. i.MACE (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke) and malig - nancies (including lymphomas and lung can - cers) occurred more often with tofacitinib (5 and 10 mg) than with a TNFi. In this trial, the number needed to harm for tofacitinib at 5 mg BID relative to a TNFi was 567 pa - tient-years for MACE and 276 patient-years for cancer. This means that 113 and 55 pa - tients would need to be treated for 5 years with tofacitinib (rather than a TNFi) to re - sult in one additional MACE and malignan - cy, respectively. ii.In a prespecified subgroup analysis, differ- ences in the risk of MACE and cancers bet - ween tofacitinib and a TNFi were more pro - nounced in patients 65 years of age than in younger patients. iii.The risk for overall infections, including and excluding reactivation of herpes zoster, was significantly higher in patients treated with tofacitinib (5 or 10 mg) than with a TNFi. iv.The incidences of death from any cause and of pulmonary embolism were significantly higher among patients treated with tofaci - tinib 10 mg (but not 5 mg) versus a TNFi. v.Higher incidence of thrombosis (including pulmonary with (fatal infarction or stroke) and cancers, excl. NMSC. 2.Efficacy: Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and Health Assessment Question - naire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI).1. SafetyThe ORAL Surveillance revealed (8): 2. Efficacy22 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023Discussion Spontaneous adverse drug reaction reporting shows several limitations, which are mainly related to under-reporting (9). Integrated clinical data sets might enhance sensitivity to detect adverse drug reactions when the duration of follow-up, size of treatment groups and chosen control are ade - quate. However, the ORAL Surveillance is by far the most thorough safety evaluation of a JAKi. Despite differences in JAK-inhibition profiles, all JAKi share the same mechanism of action. In the absence of detailed safety data on non-tofacitinib JAKi, the FDA concluded that the identified risks observed with tofacitinib in RA apply to all JAKi approved for the treatment of chronic inflamma - tory diseases and extrapolated these data to all pa - tients and all licensed indications (2). Swissmedic and the EMA adopted this approach (10, 11) . The FDA, EMA and Swissmedic mandated the fol - lowing risk minimisation measures:i.Based on the results of the ORAL Surveil - lance, all three national competent authori - ties required strengthening of the warnings on the label of the JAKi covered by this re - view regarding MACE, malignancies, throm - bosis and increased all-cause mortality. ii.In addition, the Swissmedic and EMA labels of the JAKi covered in this review state that JAKi should be used in the following pa - tients only when no suitable treatment al - ternatives are available: Patients over 65 years of age, Patients who currently smoke or have previously smoked, Patients with other risk factors for malignant disease, Patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. 2. Boxed warning The FDA, EMA and Swissmedic labels of the JAKi that are the subject of this review now include a boxed warning, the strictest and most serious type of warning. The FDA updated the boxed warning at the begin - ning of the label, which now covers serious infec - tions, higher rate of all-cause mortality, malignan - cies, MACE and thrombosis. Swissmedic added a similar boxed warning at the beginning of the label covering all these important AESIs. The boxed warning in the EMA SmPC in section 4.4 \"Special warnings and precautions for use\" states that JAKi should be used only when there are no suitable alternatives available in patients 65 years, current or past smokers or those with risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer. 3. Limiting indication The FDA limited the use of the JAKi covered in this review for all licensed indications to patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNFi. The ORAL Surveillance revealed similar efficacy for tofacitinib and TNFi, with TNFi showing better safety. The results were extrapolated to all patient populations in all licensed indications.1. Update warnings 3. Dosing i.There was a dose-dependent significant dif - ference in the frequency of serious infections, thrombosis (PE, VTE) and death from any cause. For MACE and malignancies the diffe - rences did not reach statistical significance. ii.There was no dose-dependent difference in the clinical efficacy of tofacitinib (5 mg vs 10 mg) in RA.23 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023FDA EMA SMC Label update of Warnings and Precautions Boxed warning in label(Last line treatment in patients with risk factors) Limiting indication to post-TNFi -- (Further measures are under evaluation) Update of dose recommendations in patients with in - creased risk for thrombosis, MACE and malignancies-- (Further measures are under evaluation) DSC / DHPC Link Link Link In summary, the FDA mandated a large post-mar - keting safety study with a long follow-up on tofac - itinib vs. TNFi in RA patients. This study revealed that tofacitinib had a higher risk for serious in - fections, MACE, malignancies, thrombosis and all-cause mortality compared to TNFi. In contrast to the safety profiles, the efficacy was similar/compa - rable in the three treatment arms. In the absence of detailed safety data for non-to - facitinib JAKi, the FDA, EMA and Swissmedic con - sidered these AESIs to be a class effect for all JAKi for chronic inflammatory diseases. The risk minimisation measures and risk communi - cation by the FDA, EMA and Swissmedic were sim - ilar, with the exception of restriction of the indi - cation and dose adaptation for patients with risk factors (Table 1) . Table 1. Summary of risk communication on JAKi covered in this review4. Update of dose recommendations in patients with risk factors The EMA revised the dosing recommendations for certain patient groups with risk factors and man - dated a dose reduction to the next lowest licensed dose level for certain indications for patients at in - creased risk of VTE, MACE and malignancies, as well as for patients 65 years of age and for patients with a history of chronic or recurrent infections. As stated above, the ORAL Surveillance revealed dose-dependent toxicity for tofacitinib, whereas the efficacy of tofacitinib was not dose-dependent. 5. DSC / DHPC Based on the results of the ORAL Surveillance, the FDA, EMA and Swissmedic mandated drug safety communications in 2019 and 2021. In March 2023, the MAHs of the JAKi covered in this review circu - lated joint DHPCs mandated by Swissmedic and the EMA on the JAKi class effect.24 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023References (1) U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

So far, little is known about similar cases following vaccination in elderly people, although suspected cases with fatal outcome were recently published (2). There - fore, Swissmedic Pharmacovigilance performed a careful examination of case reports received in this particular age group. Methods Evaluation with descriptive statistics of case re - ports from the Swiss pharmacovigilance database in elderly patients ( 65 years). Results By the end of 2022, Swissmedic had received 32 case reports of myocarditis (n=9), pericarditis (n=14) or perimyocarditis (n=9) in elderly patients. Of these, 20 cases were reported in association with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and 11 with the Pfiz - er-BioNTech vaccine. Based on criteria of the US CDC (3), the clinical diagnosis of myocarditis and/ or pericarditis was mostly judged as \"probable\" (n=11) \"confirmed\" (n=10). cases of my - ocarditis (5/9) and perimyocarditis (4/9) remained clinically unconfirmed compared to cases of peri - carditis (2/14). The age of patients ranged between 65 and 88 years (mean=72 years) and more events were re - ported in men (n=21; 65.6%) than in women (n=9; 28%). Pre-existing cardiovascular diseases were recorded in 13 of the 32 patients. At the time of reporting, 22 cases were clinically recovered or recovering. However, 6 cases needed ICU-treat - ment and 1 case had a fatal outcome. More cases were reported after the second vaccine dose (n=16; 50%) compared to the first (n=9; 28%) or the third dose (n=4; 12%). The time to on - set (TTO) ranged from <1 to 327 days (medi - an=14.5 days), with a faster onset of symptoms after the second (median TTO=11.5 days) or third vaccine dose (median TTO=12.5 days) compared to the first dose (median TTO=22 days). In most of the 32 cases (n=23; 72%) the TTO was shorter than 28 days. Conclusions These findings enhance the knowledge about cardiac adverse reactions to the mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 in the elderly population. Swiss - medic received reports of confirmed myocarditis and/or pericarditis in temporal association with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for this age group as well. Most cases had a favourable outcome, where - as some cases had a severe clinical course. Hence, these diagnostic entities should be considered and thoroughly clarified in elderly patients with sug - gestive cardiac symptoms following vaccination.26 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023References (1) DHPC - mRNA Impfstoffe gegen Pericarditis: www. cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/ slides-2021-06/02-COVID-Oster-508.pdf .27 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023Reports of suspected adverse reactions following vaccination with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine Irene Scholz, MD, MPH; Thomas Stammschulte, MD Safety of Medicines Division, Swissmedic Swissmedic and Pfizer's bivalent booster in October 2022. In addition to the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, these vaccines also cover the stated Omicron subvariants. A total of 299 reports of side effects following vaccination with a bivalent vaccine were received up to 15 March 2023. In 127 further cases concern - ing a fourth or fifth vaccination, it remains unclear whether the bivalent vaccine was involved. These cases were excluded from this evaluation. The 299 reports result in a reporting rate of 0.3 re - ports per 1,000 vaccine doses for the bivalent vac - cines. The reporting rate is therefore lower than for the COVID-19 vaccines overall (1). The majority (n =166, 56%) of the reports came from medical professionals; in 44% (n =133) of cases, the reports were submitted by the person affected or a rela - tive. Most of the reports (n =221, 74%) were clas - sified as non-serious. concerned women, 73 (24.4%) men; 105 (35.1%) reports did not specify gender. The median age of those af - fected was 56 (age range: 2-102). In total, the reports included 980 reactions, i.e. an average of three reactions were listed per report. At the time the reports were submitted, the out - come of the adverse reaction was predominantly indicated as \"unknown\". The most frequent inci - dents given in the reports fall under the category \"Product storage errors and issues in the product use system\". These cases were not associated with an adverse drug reaction. The most commonly re - ported side effects in all reports included headache, fever, fatigue, urticaria and joint pain. Among the serious reports, headache, nausea, fatigue, fever and chills were the most common adverse reac - tions. The side effects profile is therefore similar to that of the monovalent vaccines (1). There is no evidence in the reports to indicate any hitherto unknown side effects of the vaccines. Evaluations of reports on Omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccines by other regulatory authorities reach sim - ilar conclusions (2, 3) .

Issue dated 4 December 2022.28 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023Reports of suspected adverse reactions following monkeypox vaccination in Switzerland Valeriu Toma, MD Safety of Medicines Division, Swissmedic Introduction As of November 2022, the Bavarian Nordic small - pox vaccine, which is authorised in Europe and the USA, may be administered in Switzerland to high- risk individuals as a preventive measure against infection with the monkeypox virus. The cantons are responsible for the organisation and admin - istration of the vaccinations and stipulate where people can be vaccinated. The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) has published comprehen - sive information on the ongoing vaccination cam - paign and treatment of monkeypox infections on its website (1). The vaccination with Jynneos\u00ae is provisionally be - ing administered in Switzerland on a no-label basis without authorisation. No-label means that, since Swissmedic has not authorised the product in Swit - zerland, the Jynneos\u00ae vaccine is administered with - out the information for healthcare professionals or patient information specific to Switzerland. At the end of 2022, the manufacturer Bavarian Nor - dic submitted an application to Swissmedic for the authorisation of the equivalent smallpox vaccine Imvanex\u00ae. Swissmedic is responsible for the market surveil - lance of authorised medicinal products (MPs), MPs which are exempt from authorisation as well as MPs that are not authorised in Switzerland, but are imported into Switzerland (based on exemp - tion provisions). According to the Therapeutic Products Act, medi - cal professionals must notify Swissmedic of any se - rious or previously unknown adverse reactions and medically significant incidents involving therapeu - tic products (Art. 59 para. 3 TPA).The reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions by healthcare professionals is an important pillar of vaccine safety. Medical professionals can submit reports to Swissmedic directly via the ElViS report - ing portal (2, 3) . Private individuals can also report suspected ad - verse reactions via a Swissmedic online portal (4, 5) . Results By 5 March 2023, Swissmedic had reviewed 39 re - ports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) following vaccination with Jynneos\u00ae, as well as three case reports in association with the Imvanex\u00ae vaccine. 37 (88%) ADR reports after monkeypox vaccina - tion were received from directly affected persons, i.e. the patients, or their relatives, and five (12%) reports were submitted by medical professionals. In 39 (92.9%) reports, the affected persons were men, who currently constitute the group of people at risk of contracting monkeypox.29 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023All of those affected were aged between 18 and 64 years (39.8 years on average). 31% were over 44 years of age, while 69% were in the 18 to 44 age group. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30unknown>= 75 years65 - 74 years45 - 64 years18 - 44 years12 -17 years2 - 11 years28 days to 23 months0-27 days 28 13 1 Of the 42 reports received, 40 (95.2%) were reported as \" non-serious\", while two of the suspected adverse re - actions (4.8%) were classified as \"serious\" by the reporting individuals. Most of the reports involved more than one reaction. In total, 90 reactions were reported, corresponding to an average of 2.1 reactions per report. The most commonly reported ADRs were local injection site reactions, headache, fatigue or fever (pyrexia).Figure 2.

There is no evidence in the reports to indicate any hitherto unknown risks of the vaccine. A review of 118 reports related to Imvanex\u00ae received by Lareb, the Dutch pharmaco- vigilance system, also did not indicate any new risk signals (6). Reporting adverse reactions or suspected adverse reactions makes an important contribution to the safety of the vaccine against monkeypox.

These errors include transfusion errors (\"incorrect blood component transfused\", IBCT) and errors detected before a transfusion took place (Near Misses). The analysis of these errors plays a significant role in haemo- vigilance. In Switzerland, reporting of these events to Swissmedic is mandatory by federal law. In 2021, 2,585 Near Misses and 49 IBCT were re - ported, including five cases of \"wrong component transfused\" (wrong patient / product, ABO-com - patible by chance). Introduction Haemovigilance is a set of surveillance procedures that cover the entire blood transfusion chain, from the donation and processing of blood to the epi - demiological follow-up of patients (1). In the pre - vious edition of Vigilance News, we presented an overview of the regulatory aspects governing the haemovigilance system in Switzerland and focused on transfusion reactions reported to Swissmedic in 2021. Today, we turn our attention to the re - porting of errors in the transfusion process in 2021. Errors in the transfusion chain consist of transfu - sion errors, also known as IBCT (Incorrect blood component transfused), and errors that were de - tected before a transfusion took place - so-called \"Near Misses\" (NM) or \"errors without harm\". Swissmedic is responsible for monitoring the safety of medicinal products according to Art. 58 TPA (Therapeutic Products Act, SR 812.21), in - cluding blood and blood products according to Art. 4 para. 1 TPA. Art. 59 para. 3 TPA requires serious or previously unknown adverse effects and incidents, observations of other serious or previ - ously unknown facts and quality defects that are of significance for drug safety to be reported. Equal - ly, reporting adverse events relating to medicinal products (including transfusion errors) to Swiss - medic is mandatory according to Art. 63 of the TPO (Therapeutic Products Ordinance). The explanatory report on the TPO (published in September 2018) explicitly addresses Near Misses in this context. Looked at more closely, IBCT are events where a blood component was transfused to a patient for whom it was not intended, where the transfusion was compatible by chance, was not suitable or not necessary, or where the transfusion was delayed for a significant amount of time (2). Depending on the kind of error, IBCT have a high potential to cause morbidity or death. Near Misses are \"errors without harm\" but involve incidents in which an intended process failed. Thus, a structured analysis of these events helps to identify gaps in safety mechanisms, sources of errors, effective barriers and potential points for improvement and thereby increase transfusion safety. Transfusion errors in 2021 Swissmedic classifies IBCT events following the cri - teria defined by SHOT (Serious Hazards of Trans - fusion), the haemovigilance scheme of the United Kingdom - seen in Table 1 (3). A transfusion error can originate from any point in the transfusion chain: ordering the blood product, taking the blood sample, laboratory analysis, releasing the product or the transfusion itself. In order to carry out an adequate analysis, error reports include the Swiss Haemovigilance System Incorrect Blood Component Transfused (IBCT) and Near Misses Julia Engels, MD; Max Mendez Lopez, MD Safety of Medicines Division, Haemovigilance, Swissmedic32 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023cause and type of deviation (e.g. communication, documentation, technical error), as well as error discovery and measures taken on site. In terms of severity, IBCT and NM events are clas - sified according to their potential harm or - in the case of NM - risk of mix-up. For a detailed expla - nation of severity and for further examples, please refer to the \"Annual Haemovigilance Report 2021\" (Publications & Events, swissmedic.ch ).A total of 49 IBCT and 2,585 Near Misses were re - ported to Swissmedic in 2021, which corresponds to reporting rates (RR) of 0.18/1,000 (IBCT) and 9.1/1,000 (NM) transfusions. In the case of IBCT, the RR is slightly higher than that for 2020 (0.14/1,000), but remains within the 5-year average of 0.16/1,000 transfusions (Figure 1) . Wrong component transfused (WCT) Cases in which a patient was transfused with a blood product different from the one prescribed (e.g. platelets instead of RBC), in which the blood product was of an incorrect blood group or was intended for another patient (and was ABO/RhD incompatible), or where the blood product was transfused to another patient and was compatible by chance. Specific requirements not met (SRNM) Cases in which the transfused blood component did not meet the required specifications because of an error (e.g. irradiated products or HLA-matched platelets when indicated). If the deviation is the result of a deliberate clinical decision (e.g. because of an emergency situation) it is not considered an SRNM (one exception here is the deliberate administration of Rhesus D-positive blood to Rhesus D- negative recipients in the context of a mass transfusion - this situation should be reported). Handling and storage errors (HSE) Cases in which a blood product is selected and tested correctly, but its quality or safety are compromised due to errors in handling or storage (e.g. interruption of the cold chain, incorrect thawing of plasma, shelf life exceeded). Avoidable, delayed or under-/over-transfusion (ADU) ADU is the term used to describe errors in the quantity and timing of transfusions: Avoidable transfusions : Transfusions in which the indication was incorrect, e.g. due to incorrect laboratory results (such as false low haemoglobin or platelet values), errors in transmitting results or incorrect clinical decisions. The term also covers the avoidable use of emergency products (0 RhD neg). Delayed transfusions : Clinically indicated transfusions, which were not given or were given with a relevant delay. These include, for ex - ample, the delayed provision of blood products in an emergency situation with relevant delays in patient care (e.g. rescheduling of surgery) Over-/under-transfusion : Transfusion of too large or too small a quantity of a product, e.g. due to incorrect prescription or the malfunc - tion of an infusion pump. Right blood, right patient (RBRP) Incidents in which the transfusion was correct but there were relevant errors in identifying or prescribing the blood products. These include, for example, damaged or incomplete labelling, a missing patient ID bracelet, a missing official prescription or missing signatures.Table 1.

IBCT and Near Miss 2021 Reports/1,000 transfusionsBlood products supplied (in thousands)Near Miss reporting rate The reporting rate for IBCT in 2021 remains within the 5-year average of 0.16/1,000. The reporting rate for Near Misses rose in 2021 (9.1 reports per 1,000 transfusions in 2021 versus 8.7 in 2020). The reporting rate for IBCT in 2021 remains with - in the 5-year average of 0.16/1,000. The reporting rate for Near Misses rose in 2021 (9.1 reports per 1,000 transfusions in 2021 versus 8.7 in 2020).Within the IBCT subcategories, SRNM accounted for the majority 63.3%), followed by HSE (n=7, 14.3%) (Figure 2) . The majority of at the step of \"component selection\" (n=26, 84%) and, in most cases, involved giving Rhesus D positive blood to Rhesus D negative patients (so called \"Rhesus D conversion\"; n=11, 35%). There were no ABO-incompatible transfusions reported in 2021, while three events were reported as ABO-compati - ble by chance (6%). The cause of IBCT (all subclasses) was localised in the clinical area in 56% of cases - with a similar distribution in the subclasses of SRNM and ADU. HSE occurred predominantly in the clinical area, while the majority of WCT originated in the labora - tory (Figure 3) . The majority of near misses occurred in the clinical area (preparation and administration, 96% in total), with 89% of the grade 3 errors being localised in clinical preparation. Errors were mostly discovered in the laboratory (81% of the NM re - ports), which illustrates the importance of sequen - tial control (and the possibility of discovering an error) at each step of the transfusion process.34 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 202318 1361 3 1 40 5 10 15 20 25 30 35Clinical Laboratory WCTADUHSESRNM 18 13 61 3 3 1 4 Figure 3. Localisation of error in ICBT (reported in 2021) Localisation of error in IBCT events. The numbers represent the absolute amount of reports. Different factors or situations contribute to the occurrence of transfusion errors. While half of the IBCT reported in 2021 were related to a human er - ror (51 %), contributing factors and a lack of bar- riers exist in most situations. The following contrib - uting factors were identified for the five cases of \"wrong component transfused (WCT)\": emergency situations with mix-ups due to temporary patient identification, mix-ups due to verbal prescriptions as well as the transfer of information (interface).

Conclusion Improvement in transfusion safety is one of the main goals of haemovigilance, which proactively looks for safety gaps and sources of error so that ac - tions can be taken to minimise risk. The structured analysis of IBCT and Near Misses aims to identify failed control mechanisms and points in the trans - fusion chain that can be improved. Furthermore, in - dividual examples can be helpful in raising aware - ness of particularly critical processes. The processing and reporting of errors represent an opportunity to increase the safety of transfusions.35 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023Information on the Swissmedic website Pharmacovigilance in the spotlight Learning from adverse reaction reports - cases from pharmacovigilance Side effects of COVID-19 vaccines in Switzerland 24.02.2023 Reports of suspected adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines 16,855 reports of suspected adverse vaccination reac - tions evaluatedYou can access the complete overview at hyperthyroidism 36 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 2023Healthcare Professional following the admi - nistration of Becetamol Drops at the recommended do - sage exceeds the defined thresholds for propylene glycol in neonates and children under 5 years 13.04.2023 DHPC - Simulect (basiliximabum) Important information on Simulect preparation for in - jection 10 mg and 20 mg 01.03.2023 links are available in German/French only 37 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 30 - May 202317.05.2023 Establishment licence for Dr. Heinz Welti AG: Suspen - sion of establishment licence at Gebenstorf site lifted Manufacturing and distribution activities at the Buben - dorf site still suspended 11.05.2023 Establishment licence of Amino AG: Manufacture of non-sterile medicinal products permitted again at the Gebenstorf site Manufacturing and distribution activities at the Belp site still suspended 01.05.2023 Changes to the guidance document GMP compliance by foreign manufacturers and the form Declaration by the Responsible Person for foreign manufacturers Clarification of the requirements for the submission of audit reports 01.05.2023 Changes to the forms for new authorisations of and vari- ations to human and veterinary medicinal products) Information on study design and data sources of RWE in application forms 21.04.202 Swissmedic issues warning about erectile stimulants from online sources Man hospitalised after taking illegal erectile stimulants - Swissmedic issues warning erectile stimulants from Internet sources 11.04.2023 Swissmedic approves bivalent Pfizer Ltd.
