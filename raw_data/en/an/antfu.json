Find out what to expect from some of the most common tests. If you've been diagnosed with myocarditis or you think you have symptoms of myocarditis, it can be worrying. But with treatment most people will make a very good recovery. Some people will have more serious complications and will need specialist treatment. On this page we answer the most common questions people have about myocarditis, including: Myocarditis is a disease that causes inflammation of the heart muscle (the myocardium). Inflammation is your body's natural way of fighting things that can harm it, such as infections or injuries. It can cause symptoms that affect your daily life. Myocarditis can develop suddenly (acutely), can be recurring or it can be long-lasting (chronic). Most people will recover without any lasting effects. But in rare cases, if the inflammation is severe, myocarditis can scar the heart muscle. This damage means the heart has to work harder to pump blood and oxygen around the body. In some cases, this can result in the heart muscle becoming bigger, and over time, weaker. Sometimes, myocarditis can affect the heart's electrical system, leading to an irregular heart beat (arrythmia). Myocarditis can sometimes happen together with [pericarditis ](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/pericarditis)(inflammation of the lining around the heart) and they have similar symptoms. If you have both myocarditis and pericarditis, this is sometimes known as myopericarditis. People with myocarditis can get chest pain and feel breathless. It's not unusual for these symptoms to start up to two weeks after being unwell with an infection. Common symptoms of myocarditis include: Some people have no symptoms, and their myocarditis may be picked up as part of a routine health appointment. If you think you have symptoms of myocarditis, contact your doctor straightaway, or call NHS 111. Getting diagnosed and treated early can help you feel better and lower your risk of long-term complications from myocarditis. Sometimes, symptoms of myocarditis are like heart attack symptoms. If you have unexplained chest pain and/or shortness of breath, seek emergency medical help. You should call 999 immediately, if: It's common to feel a sensation of tightness or squeezing in the chest, either when at rest or when active. It could also happen if you're lying down. You may have chest pain that feels sharp or stabbing, and chest pain/discomfort may spread to other parts of your body. If the inflammation in your heart muscle also affects the lining of the heart (pericardium), your chest pain may feel better when you lean forward, and worse when you lie back. Inflammation can also cause extra heart beats that feel like a flutter in your chest. And if you have a run of a lot of extra beats together you may also feel light-headed. Myocarditis is most commonly caused by: If you're worried, you can read more about the [ effect of Covid-19 on the heart](/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/coronavirus-and-your-health/what-does-coronavirus-do-to-your-body), including how it can cause myocarditis. When myocarditis is caused by a virus, symptoms can start to show one or two weeks later. This is because the immune system, the body's own natural defence system, overreacts to being infected with a virus, and causes inflammation. This inflammation can stay in the heart even after the virus has gone. Other causes include: Sometimes it isn't possible to find the cause of myocarditis. This can be frustrating and difficult for you.

These tests are very common, don't take long (sometimes just a few minutes), and most people don't feel any pain or discomfort when having them. Other tests such as cardiac MRI and coronary angiogram may be done to help rule out other common cardiac causes. In very rare cases a heart biopsy may be considered. This is where the doctor takes a tissue sample from your heart muscle (myocardium) for analysis. BHF-funded researchers are developing the [first-ever blood test](https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2022/november/hope-for-first-blood-test-to-detect-deadly-heart-inflammation) for myocarditis, which they hope will lead to speedy diagnosis. Your treatment will depend on your symptoms and the cause of them. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment options with you. Treatment can include: Your doctor will want to watch your progress and may ask you to come back for check-ups occasionally, although these may only be once a year. It's important to go to your appointments even if you feel well. Going to these appointments will help give you the support you need. For some people, myocarditis can scar the heart muscle, so it can't pump blood around the body as well as it should. The heart becomes enlarged, and weaker. This is sometimes called dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or heart failure. Your doctor will discuss treatments and explain which one is right for you. Some people find it useful to think about questions to ask before an appointment and write these down on paper, or on their phone, so they don't forget to discuss them with their doctor. Questions you might find helpful to ask your doctor include: You may have questions that feel embarrassing or uncomfortable to talk about. Whatever question you have, your doctor has talked to lots of other people about them too. You won't be the first or the last person to ask.

Yes - most people will have one episode of myocarditis and will get better with rest, medication and avoiding high intensity exercise while their heart recovers. Doctors will follow your progress closely at first, and then you may be offered a yearly follow up appointment depending on your circumstances. For some people myocarditis will last longer, or return. If your heart is damaged (scarred) by the inflammation, doctors will check your progress closely, with follow-up appointments at least every few months. If your symptoms return, you should see a doctor straightaway or phone 111. You may need a time to rest, so depending on how serious your symptoms are and what work you do, you may need to take time off work. If you're not well enough to go to work, or if work is holding up your recovery, you can get a \"fit note\" ( [Statement of Fitness to Work](https://www.gov.uk/taking-sick-leave)) from your GP, or in England and Wales, nurses, pharmacists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists will also be able to write fit notes. It can feel difficult to talk to work about taking time off, or you may feel worried about whether you'll get sick pay. Get answers to your questions about work and a heart condition.

Talk to your doctor about how long you should rest before re-starting exercise, and about types of exercise you can do safely.
