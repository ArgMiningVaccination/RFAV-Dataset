This handbook will provide you with essential information about the DNP program. We urge you to carefully review this document and other s provided to you by the University to strengthen your understanding of our philosophy, mission, policies, and procedures. This handbook is prepared in conjunction with the policies expressed in the UC Irvine (UCI) General Catalogue and the Graduate Policies and Procedures, and both serve as excellent resources for students. Program Description The Doctor of Nursing Practice degree is the new scholarly standard for advanced practice nursing and for nurses seeking a practice focused doctorate. Our future DNP graduates will be accomplished practitioners of translational research for evidence -based practice, advocates of innovative policy, and leaders of interdisciplinary health care teams. Mission of the School of Nursing Our mission is to advance the science of health and healthcare through innovative research, teaching, and clinical practice, and educate nursing professionals who inspire optimal health and well- being in individuals, families and communities . Vision of the School of Nursing Our vision is to transform the nursing profession by preparing pioneers in research, education, and practice to build innovative, interprofessional models of compassionate community -based healthcare. Philosophy of the School of Nursing The philosophy of the Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing is aligned with the academic goals expressed by UC Irvine and emanates from the mission and goals of both UC Irvine and the University of California; our philosophy applies to both graduate and undergraduate programs. Nursing is interdisciplinary and collaborative in its art and its science. Together with other health professionals, the professional nurse addresses health care needs of individuals, families, and gr oups from diverse backgrounds. Health care needs range across the health -illness continuum from health promotion and wellness to intervention, treatment, rehabilitation, restoration, and palliation in response to illness. Professional nursing practice can occur in any environment and includes research, clinical practice, education, and leadership roles. Nursing practice is guided by a set of ethical principles that include a commitment to service and quality health care for all people regardless of their culture, race, gender, or 3 social status. Each person with whom nurses interact possesses a unique set of biological, behavioral, socio -cultural, and spiritual characteristics. It is the responsibility of the professional nurse to understand and respect thes e characteristics and their role in the well- being of the individual. It is the right and responsibility of the individual, family, or group to make autonomous health care decisions and to collaborate with nurses and other health care professionals in their care. Nursing research and scholarship provides the evidence for nursing practice and is both basic and applied. Professional nurses evaluate the evidence when considering care alternatives. They participate in research to advance scholarly nursing pract ice that is founded on scientific principles. Nursing students are unique individuals with diverse backgrounds and life experiences that enrich the educational environment for all students. Nursing students require substantive backgrounds in the theory an d practice of nursing as well as in related disciplines including the biological, social, behavioral, medical, pharmaceutical, and biomedical sciences. They also require guidance to achieve increasingly complex levels of socialization, critical thinking, w ritten and oral expression, and research skill based on their educational level. Nursing students have the responsibility to actively participate in their learning. The University provides multiple support systems which students have the responsibility to access when needed. Faculty have the responsibility of structuring the teaching and learning environment to facilitate student learning taking into consideration individual learning styles and personal professional goals. Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) B ackground The DNP degree is a professional practice- focused doctorate designed to develop competencies for advanced clinical and leadership roles in nursing and healthcare. This program will increase opportunities to prepare nurses to meet the demands of an increasingly complex and changing healthcare landscape. The need for a practice -focused doctoral program was highlighted in 2004 when the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) recommended the establishment of the DNP as the professional, p ractice- focused doctoral degree in nursing. The AACN recommended that the DNP be the required credential for nurses seeking Advanced Practice Registered Nursing (APRN) certification, including the roles of Clinical Nurse Specialist, Nurse Practitioner, Certified Nurse Midwife and Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist. Additionally, other nurses in the United States seeking a practice- focused doctoral degree in nursing, rather than a research -focused doctoral degree, are selecting the DNP degree as a termin al degree. DNP -FNP The Doctor of Nursing Practice degree with a Family Nurse Practitioner concentration is the first and only program of its kind currently offered by a University of California campus. Our program is designed for BS and MS prepared nurses to achieve a doctoral degree with a FNP concentration in a compact and comprehensive three- year program. As rigorous as it is rewarding, the DNP - FNP program prepares graduates for autonomous family practice and interprofessional leadership at the highest level. The DNP - FNP program, for both BS and MS applicants, is a three -year hybrid commitment. This means students will participate online in asynchronous and synchronous sessions in addition to on campus intensives with the faculty and cohort . The intensives are highly focused on -campus session s held once 4 during most quarters along with mandatory attendance to the Prologue, Intersession, and Epilogue for the didactic portion of the program. Additionally, for students in the DNP -FNP track, there are two required advanced physical assessment in -person competency sessions in the fall quarter of Year 2. The DNP - FNP curriculum provides education in organizational and systems leadership, research and analytical methods, health care policy, interprofessio nal practice, clinical prevention, and population health to prepare our graduates for a multi- faceted and rounded approach to health care improvement. They will apply their knowledge in the DNP Scholarly Project - a capstone project of original work that establishes the student as a UCI Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing clinical scholar. Practice expertise in patient care is incorporated throughout the program. Students will complete a total of 1,020 hours of clinical and professional practice. DNP (Post -Master's) The Doctor of Nursing Practice program, for post -master's applicants, is a two -year online and hybrid commitment. This means students will participate online in asynchronous and synchronous sessions in addition to on campus intensives with the pr ofessors and cohort. The program may require one highly focused on -campus session during most quarters, along with mandatory attendance of the Prologue, Intersession, and Epilogue portions of the program. The DNP program curriculum provides education in or ganizational and systems leadership for quality improvement, research and analytical methods for evidence -based practice, education, policy, and population health. Students will develop their abilities throughout the program and through 500 - 1,050 hours o f project practica. DNP Post Masters students may bring in a maximum of 500 hours from their masters program. Student must prove they have had supervised hours in their masters program by submitting a letter from their university to the Student Affairs Office upon matriculation. Students who are board -certified NP's may receive 500 hours. 1020 hours are required for UCI's Post Master's program. 150 hours are accumulated throug h the DNP application courses. They will apply their knowledge in the DNP Scholarly Project - a capstone project of original work that establishes the student as a UCI Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing clinical scholar. Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Program Goals Learning Outcomes of the DNP Program: Upon completion of the DNP Program curriculum, and as consistent with AACN expectations and standards, the DNP graduate will be able to: 1. Demonstrate advanced levels of clinical judgment, system s thinking and accountability in designing, delivering, and evaluating evidence -based care to improve patient outcomes. 2. Integrate nursing science, science -based theory, and systems knowledge into the development and evaluation of new practice approache s to care. 3. Employ advanced communication skills and processes to lead quality improvement and safety initiatives. 4. Apply analytic methods to the critical appraisal of literature and other evidence to develop and support best practice. 5 5. Disseminat e data from evidence -based practice and research to support improvements in health outcomes. 6. Convene and lead interprofessional, collaborative stakeholder teams to create change and advance positive health outcomes. 7. Generate, evaluate, and articulate innovative solutions to complex care issues. 8. Analyze the impact of local, national, and global health policy on determinants of care decisions. 9.

DNP ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS AND STEPS TO SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM COMPLETION DNP - FNP Curriculum The DNP Program requires a combination of didactic and clinical content with additional doctoral practicum units. The DNP - FNP track requires eleven (11) quarters for completion and may be completed in less than 3 calendar years. DNP - FNP students are req uired to complete 98 quarter units of formal coursework, consisting of DNP core courses, APRN (NP Role) courses, and DNP APRN Practicum courses. Education focus courses are available as electives . DNP (Post -Master's) Curriculum The DNP Program requires a combination of didactic and clinical content with additional doctoral practicum units. The DNP Post -Master's track requires seven (7) quarters for completion and can be 6 completed in less than 2 calendar years. D NP (Post -Master's) students are required to complete 53 quarter units of formal coursework, consisting of DNP core courses, education focused course, and DNP practicum courses. Education focus courses are required in this curriculum. The curricular unit load and duration o f the track is consistent with other established DNP programs Required Courses To see course descriptions please access the General Catalogue . See the curriculum p lan for -Planner -for-SA-1.pdf Waiver or Transfer of Units or Courses Courses taken toward a graduate degree at another institution cannot be transferred for credit toward a DNP or PhD at UCI. However, a course requirement may be waived if a similar course was taken at another institution. The General Petition should be used for all requests for waivers of coursework. However, per University policy, all DNP students must graduate with the specified number of units required in their doctoral degree program, which is 98 units for DNP - FNP or 53 units for DNP (Post - Master's). A course waiver may be obtained for a maximum of 2 DNP courses. To obtain a course waiver for potential course equivalencies, students must provide a full description of the course, the transcript and syllabus for the course. Additional course documen ts may be requested by the faculty reviewing the waiver. If the course is determined to be equivalent by the faculty reviewing the course, it will be submitted to the Graduate Division with the General Petition form for review and approval. However, you must take another course in our DNP program in order to earn the requisite number of units for the program. One of the two education -focused electives will fulfill that requirement for DNP - FNP students; for DNP (Post -Master's) students, additional cours es may be taken from the DNP -FNP curriculum. Additionally, please be advised that course waivers do not provide a tuition fee reduction. 7 The Faculty Advisor All DNP students are assigned an academic faculty advisor in the School of Nursing. Graduate students are assigned upon entry to the graduate program. Faculty advisors are specifically focused on the professional development of students. They are also f amiliar with strategies for program success and can direct students in seeking resources. It is important to meet with your faculty advisor as needed and keep them apprised of your progress in meeting program objectives. Please make yourself familiar with the UCI Graduate Division website, which has information on all graduate policies. The DNP Program Director will serve as the faculty advisor for all DNP students during the first year of study. Once the DNP stud ent has commenced their DNP project studies, the DNP chair will serve as their faculty advisor. It is possible for students to change their faculty advisors during the program with the permission of the DNP Program Director. Students requesting a change of advisor are encouraged to discuss this request with the DNP Program Director prior to completing the change of advisor form to be submitted to the DNP Program Director and the Student Affairs Office. Evaluation of Student Progress DNP students wi ll be evaluated periodically for progress towards the degree. The DNP Program Director will review the students' Portfolios to determine whether they are progressing adequately in their studies. If students are not making satisfactory progress they will be counseled and may be placed on academic conditional status.

All UCI policies will be followed. Plagiarism software will be utilized at the discretion of the faculty for all written assignments . Faculty will review the report and maintain the authority to follow up within a range of options, inclu ding notifying students or reporting any concerns to the office of academic integrity and student conduct. PROGRESSION THROUGH THE DNP PROGRAM DNP Scholarly Project A s a professional practice -f ocused degree the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) differs from a PhD in Nursing in that DNP students will complete a Scholarly Project instead of a research -b ased dissertation. S tudents will develop their abilities throughout the program and apply their knowledge in the DNP Scholarly Project - a capstone projec t of original work that establishes the student as a UCI Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing clinical scholar. Students are encouraged to focus their scholarly project in the following areas: 1. Quality improvement project implementation 2. Health care policy project implementation 3. Evidence -based practice project implementation Each student will be matched with a DNP Scholarly Project Chair who is a faculty member in the SON . Ideally , the DNP student's interest will align with the SONs faculty's scholarly interest. That faculty member will mentor and guide the student in their Scholarly Project through completion. If at any point a student wishes to change their chair, they must complete a change of chair form to be submitted to 11 the DNP Program Director for approval. An additional DNP Scholarly Project Team Member is required , and this individual must be doctorly prepared and have a university appointment. Students should select a DNP scholarly project site mentor who has specific expertise in the area being studied. The project site mentor must be from the project implementation institution. Students are expected to progress through the curriculum as designed. Many courses provide foundational content for subsequent courses, so completing courses in sequence is required. Courses are taught once per year. Students who do not complete courses sequentially may significantly delay their time for program completion. In preparation for developing this DNP Scholarly Project , students will complete a DNP Project Proposal paper and present this to their DNP Team Chair and Team Members . Stakeholde rs, faculty, and colleagues can be invited. Once approved , the student will begin wor k on their DNP Project. Th e DNP Project will require students to demonstrate a synthesis of evidence -based practice in a practice area specific to their specialty or interest. The student will complete a formal presentation of completed work to the DNP Scholarly Project Team and stakeholders The DNP Project requires a synthesis of leadership, policy, quality, management, and practice learning experiences. Each student will collaborate with an agency, ideally their current clinical setting to address a real- world problem or health issue. Strong professional writing and public speaking skills are expected as part of the DNP Project. Institutional Review Board (IRB) registrati on for non - human subjects research , from both UCI and the proposed clinical site of the DNP Project, if indicated by IRB criteria, will be required for the respective students in accordance with policy and requirements at each setting. Copies of all IRB registration associated with the DNP Project shall be prov ided to and maintained securely on file with UCI DNP Degree program materials. Scholarly Project Completion DNP - FNP students who have successful ly presented their proposal and advanced to candidacy must complete their DNP Scholar ly Project and all coursework within sixteen quarters/terms of study from initial enrollment. DNP (Post -Master's) students who have successful presented their proposal and advanced to candidacy must complete their DNP Scholarly Project and all coursework within ten quarters/terms of study from initial enrollment. It is recommended that students communicate their progress to their DNP Scholarly Project Team Members frequently during the scholarly project series. The DNP scholarly project is an iterative experience for the DNP scholar, and the support and guidance from their DNP chair is essential for growth and und erstanding. Students are expected to complete all degree requirements within the timeline specified below. 12 DNP Program Completion Timeline The normative time to complete the requirements for the DNP - FNP is 11 quarters and for the DNP (Post -Master's) degree it is 7 quarters. Once assigned, s tudents should meet with their DNP Chair at least once a quarter/term. Satisfactory academic progress is marked by timely and successful completion of all courses, with grades of \"B\" or better in all required courses, and cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above in all coursework. Substandard work or unprofessional conduct (as reported by course instructors, preceptors or project chairs) would constitute unsatisfactory progress as would failing grades in any DNP program courses. Advancement to Candidacy A student may start implementing their project and advance to candidacy after successful completion of core coursework and after submitting a DNP form I . Students typically are allowed to start implementing the project during fall quarter of the last year in the specific program, providing there are no other deficiencies, e.g. incomplete grades. At least one quarter of study in registered student status must elapse between advancement to candidacy and conferral of the degree. Completion of Degree The DNP degree is conferred at the end of the final academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied including the submission of DNP form II . All documents are subject to the final approval of the Graduate Division A DNP degree is awarded upon successful completion of 98 units of coursework for DNP FNP and 53 units of coursework for DNP Post Masters, as well as the required clinical practicum hours and DNP Schol arly Project. Maximum Time Frame (Pace) The normative time from matriculation to degree is 11 quarters (33 months) for DNP -FNP and seven quarters (21 months) for PM . From admission to completion of DNP Scholarly Project Proposal and advancement to candidacy : 9 quarters for DNP -FNP and 5 quarters for PM . From the successful project proposal and advancement to candidacy to filing of the DNP Scholarly Project: 2 quarters minimum, ten quarters maximum for DNP -FNP and PM The maximum time for degree completion is 5 years for DNP - FNP and 4 years for PM . Periods of non -matriculated study, leaves of absence and periods of inactive status are not included in the maximum time frame (pace). 13 Lapse of Status Policy A graduate student is req uired to maintain continuous enrollment during fall, winter, spring, and summer quarter from the beginning of the program of study until awarding of the degree or certificate. This policy is designed to eliminate the need for readmission to the program, pr ovide opportunity for continuous use of facilities, including the library, and assure the development of an integrated program, which is adequately supervised and effectively completed within the time limitations allowed. Students who have failed to maintain their graduate student status will be notified in writing by the Dean of Graduate Division. Students should consult the Graduate Division for a full description regarding a Lapse of Status at: Graduate Policies and Procedures Handbook for more information. Leave of Absence (LOA) for UCI Graduate Students An academic leave of absence is intended to cover the temporary interruption of the student's academic program. Students are encouraged to meet with the DNP program director faculty advisor and Student Affairs Counselor to discuss the impact of a LOA. The following reasons for requesting a LOA must be consistent with university policy and guideline as outlined below and with the School of Nursing: 1. Serious illness or other temporary disability. 2. Family obligations. 3. Temporary interruption of the student's academic program for other appropriate reasons. An LOA does not apply under the following circumstances: 1. Student will be absent from the campus and outside California while continuing to pursue graduate research or scholarly activity (must register In- absentia - see Student Affairs for details). 2. If the student must leave the academic program for more than three quarters (should withdraw and apply for readmission at the time he/she expects to resume graduate study at UCI). 3. If the student requests such action retroactively. 4. If the student has not completed at least one quarter of graduate study at UCI. 5. If the student has not demonstrated satisfactory progress. UCI graduate students can request a leave of absence for up to one year by submitting a Leave of Absence form to Student Affairs with a written explanation of why they are requesting leave. Procedures for requesting a leave of absence . Readmission Policy A graduate student who withdraws and has not b een granted a leave of absence approved by the Dean of the Graduate Division and the School of Nursing is considered to have lapsed student status (i.e., no longer has student status). A student whose status has lapsed must re -apply to a graduate program and can only resume graduate study if readmitted. Students should refer to the Graduate Division website for information. In addition to following the UCI policy regarding readmission, students may apply for re -admission after withdrawal from the School of Nursing. Students will be required to meet with the School of Nursing 14 Admission Committee to request or discuss re -admission. Students must meet the current admission requirements set by UCI and the School of N ursing. Re -admission will be granted by majority vote of the admission committee. Re -admission will be granted on an individual basis. Students should consult with Student Affairs regarding program and university policies. Withdrawal Policy UCI Graduate students should consult the Registrar's office regarding the withdrawal policy . Students should meet with Student Affairs to discuss UCI and School policies prior to submitting withdrawal forms. Students should consult the Registrar's website for information regarding fee deadlines, refunds, and cancellation/withdrawal policies. Disqualification vs. Dismissal Disqualification means that, for one or more of the academic reasons listed below, a student is no longer eligible to continue graduate study in his/her graduate program at the University of California, Irvine. The term \"dismissal\" should not be confused w ith \"disqualification.\" Dismissal is an administrative action resulting in removal from graduate study based on behavior or conduct. Authority to terminate student status as a result of disciplinary proceedings rests with the Dean in the SON or the Dean of Students. Academic Conditional Status and Academic Disqualification Students may be placed on academic conditional status for unsatisfactory progress toward the completion of degree requirements. Unsatisfactory progress may include, but not be limited to the following: an overall grade point average below 3.0 (83.5%) ; failure to complete courses or examinations satisfactorily within the period of time specified by the graduate program Failure of both the preceptor evaluation and standardized patient exam in two clinical practicums For students failing any course with a grade of less than 83.5%, the student will be placed on academic conditional status, and counseled about the deficiency by the Faculty of Record and the Doctoral Programs Manager. The course must be retaken the following year and successfully passed. Failure of a second course will result in dismissal from the program. The DNP Program Director in consultation with student's Graduate Advisor and Faculty, may initiate procedures to place the student on academic conditional status . In such cases the student typically will receive written notice of the deficiencies and a deadline for remedying these deficiencies (i.e., for completing specific degree requirements). Failure to meet this deadline would result in a petition to the Dean of Graduate Division for disqualification from the academic program. 15 See Graduate Policies and Procedures for more details. After consultation with the DNP Program Director, Graduate Advisor and Faculty, the Dean of the Graduate Division may disqualify a student for academic reasons, including, but not limited to, having a grade point average in graduate courses below 3.0 for two or more successive quarters; or failing to pass (or not taking) a required examination or course within the time specified for that graduate program; or not maintaining satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an approved program of study. SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY POLICIES Academic Calendar Consult the Registrar's website and the UCI Catalog for detailed information on registration procedures and late changes. The School of Nursing follows the academic calendar that is posted on the Registrar's website. Grading Scale for Graduate Nursing Courses A grade of 83.5% or above is required to pass all graduate courses . Grading for nursing courses is outlined in each syllabus and adheres to university policy. Grading may consist of independent writing components such as case studies, evidence -based practice guidelines, annotated bibliographies, and article/research critiques. Grading guidelines are provided by the individual course faculty. The final grade is determined by the combination of all course requirements. Grievance Process If a student has questions about a grade, they are encouraged to discuss this with the Faculty of Record for that course. Please note that University policy stipulates that grades are final once posted. For other issues, unrelated to grades, students may contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity (OEOD) and/or the Office of the Ombudsman for supp ort. Students wishing to appeal a grade or file other grievances should first contact the Student Affairs office to begin the process. Appeals will start with the faculty of record, and if escalation is needed will then rise to the Program Director and then the Dean. If needed, the Office of the Ombudsman may be called in to mediate ( https://ombuds.uci.edu/ ). Residency Requirements In accordance with University of California policy, a minimum of six quarters in academic residence is required prior to awarding the DNP. It is the responsibility of the academic unit to inform the student upon admission to the program of the expected degree time. If a student does not meet the departmental expected degree time, not inclu ding the first three Academic Leave of Absence quarters, a letter is sent to the student and to the department requiring that the student contact her/his Faculty Advisor and set a completion date. 16 Academic Integrity As stated in UC Irvine's Code of Ethical Conduct, \" members of the University of California community are committed to the highest ethical standards in furtherance of our mission of teaching, research and public service.\" Academic integrity is a community value shared by instructors, staff, and students alike in furtherance of the University's commitment to integrity, respect, and excellence . UCI Statement of Ethical Values As outlined in UC Irvine's Academic Integrity Policy, no student shall engage in any activity that involves attempting to receive a grade by means other than honest effort and shall not aid another student who is attempting to do so. For more information s ee the University's Academic Integrity Policy Academic misconduc t includes sharing answers, using unauthorized materials, helping others to cheat, and p assing off as your own the ideas or words of another Attendance Policy Students are expected to be punctual when attending scheduled classes, seminars, and any relate d assignments, whether this is virtual or face -to-face. Students are responsible for meeting unit/content objectives covered during their absence. If course requirements cannot be met, a failure or an incomplete grade will be given, depending on the circ umstances involved. See the UCI Registrar's policy on extenuating circumstances warranting incomplete grades . Faculty Committees, School of Nursing: Student Participation DNP student participation is encouraged on the DNP Committee. This committee meets periodically throughout the academic year to conduct the business of the School of Nursing. Early in the fall quarter, email notices will be sent to all students soliciting interest in volunteering as a student representative for their respective cohort, of which 2 nd and 3rd year students will serve on the DNP committee. Students selected for committees will be required to attend the scheduled committee meetings and participate in all facets of the committee work. The term of service for DNP students will be 1 year. Students may be recused from some meetings when confidential issues are being discussed. Enrollment A full- time registration is defined as 1) payment of applicable University fees; and 2) enrollment in specified units for student's program of study. The curriculum for both the DNP - FNP and DNP Post - Master's is sequence based on course content and complexity. Each course occurs once annually. Professional Conduct Neti quette: \"Net etiquette\" describes professional communication, behavior, and collaboration in online environments. In an electronic environment, the benefit of face-to -face signaling that occurs through body language, intonation, pausing, facial expressions , and gestures may not be present or as readily clear. As a result, please be aware of the possibility of miscommunication and compose comments in a 17 positive, supportive, and constructive manner. It is expected that conduct online reflects UC Irvine's Principles of Community, which states that \"activities, programs, classes, workshops, lectures, and everyday interactions are enriched by our acceptance of one another, and we strive to learn from each other in an atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect.\" Classroom conduct : Students are expected to be prompt and knowledgeably prepared for each class at the appointed time. Courtesy is to be extended to all faculty and guest lecturers; disrespect or behavior that doesn't adhere to UC Irvine's Principles of Community will not be tolerated. Use of cell phones and texting during class and/or use of a computer for anything other than note -taking or research as directed by the instructor is not acceptable, professional behavior. Use of substances during c lass such as tobacco or other substances will result in immediate dismissal from the class. Students who wish to record the lecture must request permission to record prior to the class or provide a letter from UC Irvine's Disability Services Center. The f ollowing are examples of classroom conduct which are considered unprofessional: Disrupting the classroom by behaviors such as arriving late, not turning phones to vibrate or silence, not turning off other electronic devices, or actively engaging in non -class activities during class time. Negative behavior directed toward peers, facul ty, patients , and others with whom you have contact on line, on campus, or in any setting where the student represents the university and/or the nursing profession. Conduct that distracts or intimidates others such as talking during lectures or presentation s, bullying, aggressive behaviors, unwarranted comments, and addressing peers or faculty with disrespect Virtual Classroom Professionalism Cameras should remain on during the entirety of class. This helps your peers and instructors connect with you, and you to them. Virtual background filters may be utilized for a professional presentation . Choose an appropriate setting for attending class or instructor office hours; at home or a quiet, private space is expected. Attending class from a caf\u00e9, car, work, or other public setting is distracting, unprofessional, and violates student and patient privacy. The learning environment should be free of distractions. A learning environment with, loud noises, children, guests, and other active conversations, pedestrians , automobiles and other disruptions interferes with student learning and may violate student and patient privacy. Phones and tablets do not allow for full functionality of the virtual classroom, a laptop or desktop computer should be used to attend virtual classes. Students should be punctual and arrive to class by the scheduled class time . Before class, create a space that is conducive to focus and learning. As with an in -person lecture, come prepared with questions and comments on that we ek's course material. Have materials ready to jot down ideas and take notes. Make sure family, friends, and work knows this is a time you won't be communicating so you can focus on class. You should treat Zoom class like a regular class - come prepared, as k questions, take notes, and participate actively. 18 Dress Guidelines : Professional attire should be worn for presentations, ceremonies, job interviews, as well as any activity where a student is representing the nursing profession or the UCI School of Nursing. This may include a business suit or dress, skirt or dress slacks and blouse, or a suit or jacket and tie. Closed toe shoes are part of professional dress. In live, online class sessions students may wear professional but comfortable clothes. The type and fit of clothing should reflect an understanding of the classroom as a professional setting. See the DNP Clinical Guidelines for information on appropriate dress in the clinical setting. Unprofessional Conduct The Nurse Practice Act defines unprofessional conduct as failing to meet the minimal standards of acceptable nur sing practice. Unprofessional conduct can jeopardize the health, safety, and welfare of the public. For students, unprofessional conduct behaviors include, but are not limited to, the following: Using unsafe judgment, technical skills, or inappropriate interpersonal behaviors in providing nursing care. Rude and profane conversation and comments. Failing to maintain patient confidentiality. Speaking about or to patients, staff, or others in a dis respectful or demeaning manner. Disregarding a patient/client's dignity, right to privacy, or right to confidentiality. Failing to provide nursing care because of diagnosis, age, sex, race, color, or creed. Abusing a patient/ client / colleague/ instructor verbally , physically, emotionally, or sexually. Consistent lack of punctuality. Frequent unexcused absences. Unprofessional attire. Dismissal from a clinical site. Violation of a clinical contract. 19 Process for Addressing Unprofessional Conduct If unprofessional conduct is observed during academic activities, the student will be notified by the Faculty of Record. Standard School of Nursing processes will be implemented to address unprofessional conduct: see flow chart below. Student unprofessional conduct flow chart Consequences of Unprofessional Conduct Students are held responsible for content presented in class or clinical venues. Students who demonstrate unprofessional conduct will receive sanctions, which may include but are no t limited to: class grade being lowered, failing a course, academic conditional status, suspension or dismissal from the class or program. 20 PRACTICALITIES Change of Address, Phone or Name All local addresses, permanent addresses, and telephone numbers must be maintained through the UCI Office of the Registrar.

The Project is the required culminating deliverable in a DNP program whereby the student scholar demonstrates mastery of the scholarship of practice and bridges the gap between new science and the integration into clinical practice. The clinical scholar questions existing models and methods of care delivery within systems, agencies, or communities, and engages in the development of innovative healthcare delivery models, translates, and disseminates evidence -based outcom es, evaluates systems of care using best practices, develops and refines new protocols for care and implements policy changes to achieve improved care and outcomes (AACN, 2015a). DNP students will create a DNP project that: Reflects a translation of evidence into practice Focuses on health, practice, or policy outcomes Reflects a systems or population focus Demonstrates implementation of the change in the appropriate area of practice Includes a plan for sustainability and an evaluati on of processes and/or outcomes . The project will provide a foundation for future practice scholarship. Therefore, it is important to select a topic in which continued development will occur long after the conferral of the DNP degree. Types of DNP Scholarly Projects for UCI DNP Students National organizations such as AACN and NONPF suggest a variety of Scholarly Project types and examples that are suitable for this practice doctoral degree (See Appendix D). At UCI, DNP students will focus on these br oad areas for their individual projects: Quality improvement project implementation Health care policy project implementation Evidence -based practice project implementation DNP Scholarly Project Resources Each student will discover and utilize scholarly resources to plan, propose, implement, evaluate and disseminate their DNP Scholarly Project. In addition to this guide and individual course syllabi, the DNP Program will utilize the following resources throughout the curriculum to assist the student through the project process: Melnyk, B. & Foneout- Overholt, E. (2018). Evidence -based practice in nursing & health care, (4th edition.). Wolters Kluwer: Philadelphia, PA. ISBN 9781496384539 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. (2006).

DNP role development for doctoral advanced nursing practice, (2nd edition.). Springer Publishing Company: New York, NY. ISBN -13 978- 08261717333 25 THE DNP SCHOLARLY PROJECT TEAM - ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES Each DNP Project Team consists of at least one doctorally prepared SON faculty member (DNP Project Chair), one UCI faculty team member/ content expert, and a scholarly project site me ntor. Roles and responsibilities are outlined below. DNP Student Scholar The DNP student will develop their skills and acumen as a clinical practice scholar as they progress through this program, building their expertise in a specific practice area. The student is responsible for all facets of the DNP Scholarly Project as they \"own\" it and drive each phase in developing their Project. The DNP student's Scholarly Project is linked to required coursework, and they will receive support from the Faculty of Record for the courses linked to the Scholarly Project as well as their Schol arly Project Chair and Team. In addition, students are responsible for: Identifying a project site mentor and project site Uploading the project site mentor's CV and license to Typhon Obtaining a signed letter of support from the project site Complet ing a conflict -of-interest form (as needed) Completing the site -specific approval process for the project (as needed) DNP Scholarly Project Chair Each DNP student will be matched with a DNP scholarly project chair. The DNP student's chair must be: 1. A faculty member in the SON, and 2. Have earned a doctoral-level degree (DNP, Ph.D., EdD, PsyD, MD, etc.). The DNP program director and faculty of record for the DNP scholarly project course will attempt to match the student's scholarly interest with the S ONs faculty's scholarly interest and expertise. Factors that are considered when assigning a chair include faculty's other commitments and workload. The role of the DNP project chair is to provide general oversight, facilitate project development, and support the student's project through completion. This includes offering direction or advice, reading drafts, providing academic and professional mentorship, offering resources as appropriate, and meeting as needed to support the student. The DNP project ch air is not an editor, and students are encouraged to utilize all resources, including the UCI Center for Excellence and Academic Writing . Chairs are required to grade and approve a project proposal paper, proposal presentation, final project paper, and final presentation. DNP project chairs also are responsible for signing all required forms (DNP Form I and II) from Graduate Division. The Chair must attend the student's DNP scholarly project proposal presentation (virtually or in -person) and final project presentation in person during NS 243 DNP Epilogue. DNP Scholarly Project Faculty Team Member Scholarly project faculty team member must be a faculty member in the SON and have earned a doctoral- level degree (DNP, Ph.D., EdD, PsyD, MD, etc.). DNP chairs, in collaboration with DNP program director, scholarly project FOR, and student, may request a faculty member to serve as a DNP Scholarl y Project faculty team member. This request may be granted at the purview of the DNP chair. The purpose of the faculty team member is to provide additional support and/or to serve as a content expert for the 26 student's scholarly project. The DNP scholarly p roject faculty team member will participate in the initial planning and throughout the development and implementation of the project but will not provide feedback on written documents or proposals. The faculty team member will attend the proposal and final project presentation. Additionally, the faculty team member will need to complete documents requiring DNP scholarly faculty team member's signatures (DNP Form I and DNP Form II). DNP Scholarly Project Site Mentor All DNP students should identify a DNP scholarly project site mentor at their DNP project site. These experts have specific expertise in the student's area of scholarship to serve as an additional content expert and to provide oversight around the DNP project planning and implementation. The site mentor must hold a master's or higher academic degree. They will provide mentorship and guidance to the student in a more informal role and are not required to sign university documents for their degree conferral. Faculty of Record for DNP Scho larly Project Courses The faculty of record (FOR) for the DNP scholarly project courses has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the course syllabus, the day -to-day delivery of the course, ensuring course learning outcomes are covered and assessed, and the confirmation that grades have been submitted by the DNP chairs. The FOR also serves as a resource expert for DNP chairs and DNP students. THE DNP SCHOLARLY PROJECT - CURRICULUM DNP scholars achieve mastery of the UCI Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing DNP Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) and the nationally recognized DNP Essentials of Doctoral Education (Essentials) competencies through completion of a carefully constructed curriculum. The following courses prepare th e student through the DNP project process, ultimately culminating in dissemination of their final DNP scholarly project. NS 231 DNP Prologue - (2 units - Intensive - On Campus - Beginning of the first year) An onsite 2- 3 day immersive experience introdu ces DNP scholarship and foundations essential for academic success in a doctoral program. Preparatory activities and onsite individual and group assignments are completed. Students discuss and begin writing on their phenomenon of interest in this course.

This occurs through structured resources organized by the faculty of record. Project conceptualization and development will occur under the direction of the DNP chair and faculty team member. T he DNP chair will grade the conceptualization paper. This is the first of four DNP scholarly project courses . You are required to complete a minimum of 30 scholarly project hours over and above the time spent on course work. This time will be confirmed by your DNP chair and credit awarded by the faculty of record. 27 All DNP Students: Some community partner/agencies may require an Affiliation Agreement or Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), and/ or their own approval (their own IRB approval or committee approval) prior to the student undertaking the Scholarly Project; students must check with community partner/agency officials for information pertaining to this and confer with their scholarly project chairs if needed. All required onboarding and orientation activities must be in place prior to starting to implement the DNP scholarly project. In addition, letter of cooperation and conflict of interest form need to be completed by the end of NS 235. Conflict of interest form is required when student's project take place at their workplaces. If needed, these requirements and documents are the responsibility of the DNP student. Early identification of the DNP project approval process at the clinical site is strongly encouraged. NS 237 DNP Intersession (2 units - Intensive - On-Campus - Summer of final year) An onsite 2 -day immersive experience provides DNP students an opportunity to present and receive faculty and peer feedback on their DNP project plan. Recommendations related to methodology and practical data collection, information gathering approaches, and data analysis are also emphasized. NS 240 DNP Scholarly Project II - Proposal (1 unit - Online Seminar) Students will develop a full proposal that reflects a synthesis of the student 's knowledge from prior coursework and work in an area of interest or expertise under the direction of the DNP chair, faculty team member, faculty of record for this course, and the DNP project site mentor. This is the second of four DNP scho larly project courses. DNP chair will grade the proposal paper. Receiving a passing grade for a DNP scholarly project proposal paper is a prerequisite to a project proposal presentation. The presentation will be graded by DNP chair/faculty team member. A s uccessful proposal presentation as determined by the DNP project chair/faculty team member is necessary for Graduate Division's DNP Form I (See below for Proposal Requirements ). Please note that both DNP -FNP clinical and scholarly hours are managed by the faculty of record of the corresponding DNP APRN practicum course. Therefore, students will log all scholarly project hours in the corresponding clinical practicum course (NS288) in the Typhon. Postmaster students should log their DNP scholarly hours into a corresponding DNP practicum courses NS291. NS 241 DNP Scholarly Project III - Implementation & Evaluation (1 unit - Online Seminar) In this course, students continue developing knowledge, skills, and abilities as they implement and evaluate their DN P project implementation. Students receive direction from their DNP chair and/or faculty team member, faculty of record for this course, and DNP scholarly project site mentor as they become engaged in the microsystem where they are implementing their DNP scholarly project. Please note that DNP -FNP students will log all scholarly project hours in the corresponding clinical practicum course (NS289) in the Typhon. Postmaster students should log their DNP scholarly hours into a corresponding DNP practicum cours es NS292 . NS 242 DNP Scholarly Project IV - Implications (1 unit - Online Seminar) Students will analyze the outcome measures of their DNP Scholarly Project and complete their final DNP scholarly project paper. The DNP scholarly project chair will grade the final project 28 paper. Receiving a passing grade for a DNP scholarly project final paper is a prerequisite to a final project presentation in NS 243. This course includes reflection and mapping of the DNP scholarly project with DNP Essentials as published (See below for details regarding the Final Project Requirements). Please note that DNP -FNP students will log all scholarly project hours in the corresponding clinical practicum course (NS290) in the Typhon. Postmaster students should log their DNP scholarly hours into a corresponding DNP practicum courses NS293. NS 243 DNP Epilogue (2 units - Intensive - On-Campus, End of a final quarter) This is an on -site 2 -3 day intensive experience where DNP students disseminate the findings of their project to colleagues, faculty and stakeholders (dissemination). Students complete and submit their presentation file to the DNP scholarly project chair and faculty team member. The chair will grade the final deliverables. Continued reflection on the DNP Program and plans for further dissemination and DNP career impacts are explored. The f ollowing courses provide the student an opportunity to develop and master DNP competencies through didactic and experiential learning in preparation for development, implementation, and dissemination of the DNP Project. Students must document 30 DNP practi cum hours in hybrid courses (NS 232, 234, 239, 239) in the Typhon. NS 232 Leadership & Professional Collaboration in Healthcare (3 + 1 units - Hybrid Course) Explore and debate the relationship between various leadership and collaboration models, theori es in health care practice, and outcomes.

Please refer to Appendix E for instructions on how to log DNP scholarly project hours. DNP SCHOLARLY PROJECT - CONCEPTUALIZATION /PLANNING PROPOSAL , IMPLEMENTATION , EVALUATION & DISSEMINATION UCI DNP Proposal and Final Project Template The DNP scholar must adhere to the university formatting and submission requirements of the graduate project. UCI Libraries maintain the templates to assist in formatting the graduate manuscript. The DNP 30 scholar will utilize the School of Nursing DNP template that will be provided in the scholarly project course series. This template adheres to the university requirements. Students are encouraged to utilize the template from the beginning of the scholarly project course series. Project Identification/Conceptualization/Planning The project begins with clinical or practice -based scholarly inq uiry to build on the NS 233 Appraisal and Translation of Evidence course. Students will consider project options, such as a quality, safety or practice improvement initiative, development of a healthcare program or healthcare delivery innovation, or a health policy evaluation or initiative. Regardless of the project type, evidence synthesis, leadership, and measurement of outcomes are incorporated (Moran et al., 2019). Students are encouraged to consider how they will address the following within their proj ect: \"EC as PIE: Enhancing outcomes (health/practice/policy), Culmination of practice inquiry, Partnership engagement, Implementing evidence, and Evaluation of outcome\" (Waldrop, Caruso, Fuchs, and Hypes, 2014). In the first DNP scholarly project series course, NS 235, students will conceptualize and begin to create their project plan. Students will develop a draft of the project plan and complete half of their project proposal draft (Conceptualization paper: Background, PICOT, Project Framework, Literatu re Review). At this time, students will assume a leadership role to identify and secure necessary resources for completion of their project as well as ongoing project leadership necessary for successful completion of their project. Students must identify a community, organization, or agency in which they will implement their project, secure an affiliation agreement, if necessary, identify their project site mentor, stakeholders (including inter- or intra- professional collaborations), and identify their faculty member with collaboration with their DNP chair. The project plan is contained within their project proposal and approved by their DNP chair. Project Proposal & Concurrent DNP or DNP -FNP Practicum In the second DNP project series course, NS 240, stud ents will finalize the method section of the proposal, mobilize resources to facilitate successful implementation, and complete a full proposal based on course guidelines. Implementation & Evaluation and Concurrent DNP or DNP -FNP Practicum The third project series course, NS 241, provides faculty support and guidance to the student as they assume leadership roles within the organization or setting to implement their project and collect their data. During and upon the completion of implementation, studen ts should perform evaluation of program implementation (formative and summative evaluations). Evaluation of Outcomes Measures/Implications and Concurrent DNP or DNP -FNP Practicum The fourth and final project series course, NS 242, provides faculty support and guidance to the student as they complete their project. Students will reflect on the application of the DNP Essentials as related to the project as well as individual transformational change. Students will start analyzing collected data and find answers for their project questions. DNP projects are designed to assess percent improvement of the practice change. Quality or performance improvement projects should assess percent improvement or attainment of benchmarks. The DNP student is not required to utilize advanced statistical software programs or complete an advanced statistical analysis. 31 Students will complete their final project paper including all written deliverables.

DNP SCHOLARLY PROJECT : IRB REQUIREMENTS (UCI AND COMMUNITY ) All UCI faculty, staff, and students may log into Kuali Research Protocols (KRP ) and follow the steps to complete their application for registration of their project. This tool is now online, and no paper versions are needed. All DNP projects should fall under non- human subjects research. If a student suspects that they may need full IRB approval, then they should consult with their chair for clarification. Research studies require full IRB approval. DNP projects do not. Kuali Research Protocols (KRP) User Guide for step -by-step instructions. Human Research Protection (HRP) staff also hold office hours on Z oom every day of the week . If students have any questions regarding their project, they may join any office hours without an appointment. https://research.uci.edu/human -research -protections/contact- hrp-staff/hrp -office - hours/ 33 Institutional Human Research Protections (HRP) Kuali Research Protocols (KRP): Administrative Determination vs IRB Protocol Submission Version February 16, 2022 There are 3 types of applications in KRP . Keep this reference on hand when navigating human subject research at UCI. Non- Human Subjects Research (NHSR) Self-Determination Exempt Self -Determination UCI allows Exempt Self- Determination for Categories 1 -4ii. There are exceptions for certain populations and procedures. Exempt Research that Requires IRB Approval Exempt research that is not eligible for Self-Determination or that requires limited IRB review, must be submitted for UCI IRB review and approval. NOT Human Subject Research Human Subject Research UCI IRB Review is NOT Required UCI IRB Review Required Administrative Determination Submission Required IRB Protocol Submission Required Existing self -determinations completed prior to the launch of KRP (September 2021) remain valid. Do not re- submit in KRP. Activities may begin once the self -determination form is completed and submitted. The UCI IRB will not review or approve the submission. If sponsor requires evidence of NHSR, print the Administrative Determination Submission from KRP and provide this documentation to the sponsor. The Education and Quality Improvement Program (EQUIP) will conduct routine quality assurance review of the submissions to ensure accuracy of the self -determinations. Amendments are not necessary unless activity no longer qualifies for the self - determination. In that case, ame nd the submission in KRP to allow for IRB review OR submit a new study in KRP. Activities may begin once UCI IRB Approval has been granted. EQUIP will conduct routine quality assurance reviews of IRB approved protocols. Minor changes to exempt research do NOT require an amendment. Significant changes to exempt research require UCI IRB review and approval. See HRP website: Protocol Amendments **** Students may also be asked to complete IRB approval at their DNP project site. All requirements and committee submissions are the responsibility of the student. Students are encouraged to identify all project needs early as the process may take several months to complete. 34 DNP STATISTICS The completion of a basic statistics course within 5 years is a prerequisite for the DNP program. DNP projects are designed to assess percent improvement of the practice change. Quality or performance improvement projects should assess percent improvement or attainment of benchmarks. The DNP student is not required to utilize advanced statistical software programs or complete an advanced statistical analysis. PROQUEST The electronic vers ion of the master's thesis , doctoral dissertation , doctoral capstone, including a DNP project, must follow all formatting requirements set forth in the UCI Formatting manual. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that the thesis/dissertation / DNP project appears as originally intended when it is accessed or printed. DNP students must utilize the DNP project template and are advised to utilize the template from their first scholarly course. The DNP project paper must be submitted as a single electronic Portable Document Format (PDF) file. If the original DNP project paper is a Microsoft Word or RTF file, you will be able to convert the DNP project paper to a PDF at t he UCI Thesis/Dissertation Submission Site . If the doctoral paper is not in Microsoft Word, RTF, or PDF - e.g. LaTeX or WordPerfect - it must be converted to PDF before the student uses the Subm ission Site. Certain types of fonts and graphics work better with PDF, and special attention should be paid to creating equations for PDF conversions. Optional supplemental files (images, video, audio) that are an integral part of the DNP project paper but not part of the full text may also be submitted electronically . Students will adhere to the university requirements and deadlines . DNP PORTFOLIO Each DNP student will develop and submit a professional portfolio documenting individual achievement of the program learning outcomes. The portfolio will include reflection on evidence demonstrating clinical scholarship and competency in all domains of DNP practice, as outlined in 1) the American Association of Colleges of Nursing Essentials of Doctoral Education for Advanced Nurse Practice, 2) Program Learning Outcomes, and 3) the DNP Core Competencies established by the National Association of Nurse Practitioner Faculties (DNP/FNP only). Evaluation of the DNP Portfolio occurs at the end of NS 243 and is based on the DNP Portfolio Rubric. The DNP Portfolio is an electronic platform. See below for instructions. 35 Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Program DNP Port folios Instructions for Accessing Student Folders All DNP Students will be given a Microsoft\u00ae OneDrive folder to upload mastery and portfolio assignments.

This portion of the program is designed to maximize clinical learning and skill progression over time. Specific requirements fo r each clinical course will be provided in the individual course syllabus. During your clinical rotations you are representing the University of California, Irvine, School of Nursing, Family Nurse Practitioner Track, as well as the nurse practitioner profe ssion. You are also establishing a professional network for your future: a clinical preceptor might be a future employer or provide a reference for letters of recommendation. It is recognized that patient problems encountered in the clinical setting fre quently do not coincide with the didactic content. Nonetheless, the student is expected to gather complete subjective and objective data on all patients. All students are required to demonstrate knowledge, critical thinking, and clinical skills within the practice setting. Students are not expected to be able to diagnose all problems or to develop treatment plans for all patients depending upon their standing in the program; however, the student must know and respect their limitations in knowledge and consu lt or refer appropriately to ensure patient safety. Every effort to critically think and contribute to the plan of care for each patient encounter should be employed. Clinical performance is expected to progress alongside the student's academic advancement each quarter. The ability to obtain a history, present patient cases, perform physical examinations, interpret findings, integrate lab data, articulate differential diagnoses, and delineate initial management plans is expected to progress with increasing accuracy each quarter. Upon graduation from UCI's DNP/ FNP program, the student will be prepared to care for individuals and families across the lifespan with a focus on delivering patient centered care. Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Program Goals Upon completion of the DNP Program curriculum, and consistent with AACN' s position statement, expectations, and standards, the DNP graduate will be able to: 1. Demonstrate advanced levels of clinical judgment, systems thinking and accountability in designing, delivering, and evaluating evidence -based care to improve patient outcomes within an increasingly complex practice. 2. Integrate nursing science, science -based theory, and systems knowledge into the development and evaluation o f new practice approaches to care. 3. Employ advanced communication skills and processes to lead quality improvement and safety initiatives. 4. Apply analytic methods to the critical appraisal of literature and other evidence to develop and support best p ractice and the education of the current and future workforce. 5. Disseminate data from evidence -based practice and research to support improvements in health outcomes. 6. Convene and lead interprofessional, collaborative stakeholder teams to create chang e and advance positive health outcomes. 39 7. Generate, evaluate, and articulate innovative solutions to complex care issues. 8. Analyze the impact of local, national, and global health policy on determinants of care decisions. 9. Support cost and resource efficiency, quality, and accessibility of health care for diverse client groups. 10. Advocate for nursing and socially and ethically relevant policy in health care design and delivery. 11. Support and effectively lead quality improvement initiatives that enhance safe, high quality, and evidence -driven care. 12. Effectively synthesize data from research, practice evidence, and other credible sources to drive care recommendations and policy. Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP -FNP) Program Goals Upon comple tion of the DNP Program curriculum, and as consistent with AACN expectations and standards, the DNP graduate will be prepared to sit for the national Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) board certifying exam. 1. Conduct comprehensive health and psychosocial asses sments in a culturally sensitive manner for a specific population, including a detailed health history and complete physical examination. 2. Order and interpret diagnostic tests and procedures. 3. Differentiate, diagnose, and manage acute and chronic health prob lems. 4. Prescribe and manage pharmacotherapeutic agents and other therapies. 5. Provide health teaching and supportive counseling with an emphasis on development, prevention of illness, health maintenance, and chronic disease management. 6. Apply a holistic perspe ctive to form therapeutic partnerships to facilitate informed decision making, positive lifestyle change, and appropriate self- care. 7. Manage and negotiate a variety of healthcare systems with an emphasis on vulnerable and underserved populations. Clinical P lacement Process Clinical practicums provide experiences that build on each student's knowledge and skills as they progress through the program. The clinical placement process is fluid and dynamic and is secured through a partnership with students, faculty , preceptors, and healthcare organizations. Students are encouraged to actively partner with the FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator and make referrals of clinicians within their community with whom they have a professional relationship and that may serve as a preceptor. As active participants in the placement process, students are to provide all available information they may have regarding referrals, contacts, or potential preceptors. (Refer to \"Pearls for Recruiting Preceptors\" in Appendix D). Students with a potential new preceptor should complete the \"New Preceptor/Clinical Site Information\" form for processing as soon as possible. The form is available in Appendix E and should be submitted to the FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator. Faculty will review and 40 approve all p otential clinical sites and potential preceptors for their ability to support students in meeting course objectives. Upon approval efforts will be made to secure an affiliation agreement if such an agreement is not currently in p lace and active. This process is laborious, requiring extensive review by Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs at UCI Health and approval by the Dean, so it is to the student's benefit to submit requests as soon as the opportunity presents itself. Clinical placement sites will, ideally, be in the primary care setting and align with our mission and vision to prepare the future advanced practice nursing workforce to provide healthcare to vulnerable populations Students will be assigned to faculty approved clinical placements , considering the following factors: o Learning opportunity/value o Specific advanced practice registered nursing course learning objectives o Students' strengths/needs in conjunction with clinics/preceptors' strengths/needs o Preceptor/site availability o Bilingual capability/clinic requirement Students may not decline a clinical placement for any reason; clinical placement selections are a collaborative effort involving multiple factors. o For your rights, options, and resources regarding religious accommodations (based on a held religious belief, practice, or observance), please contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity (OEOD) at oeod@uci.edu . o For your rights, options, and resources regarding pregnancy related accom modations (including pre -pregnancy, pregnancy, post -partum, and pregnancy loss), please contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity (OEOD) at oeod@uci.edu . Although faculty and staff will make every effort to identify sites for precepted rotations as close to the student's place of residence as possible, statutory regulations, UCI Health policies and procedures, requirements of health care provider sites, competition for sites, etc., may limit the location and selection of sites o Students need to be prepared to travel up to 100 miles and have flexible schedules to accommodate clinical experiences. In some cases, additional travel distance may be necessary to secure a clinical site. The student's tenure at each site will vary: the usual duration consists of one to three quarters with varied weekly hours. o While it is ideal for one preceptor to provide all required clinical experiences each practicum, it is not uncommon to have 2 -3 preceptors assigned per quar ter to ensure there are ample opportunities to meet course requirements The clinical experience includes family practice, adult/gerontological medicine, pediatrics, and OB-GYN. Additional rotations in subspecialty practices may be completed during the clinical practicum. Specialty sites will be considered for placements but must provide learning opportunities aligned with advanced practice registered nursing course objectives and be approved by the FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator. The FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator manages student placements throughout clinical rotations in partnership with the faculty of record. o Site visits, interviews, and meetings with preceptors will be conducted as necessary to ensure clinical sites provide appropriate learning valu e. 41 The School of Nursing will secure all necessary legal affiliation agreements among the clinical sites and/or preceptors and the University. o Each clinical site requires an active affiliation agreement. o The Affiliation Agreement must be in place prior to a student beginning a clinical rotation. The student may NOT attend clinical at a site without an active affiliation. Upon approval of the clinical site, the clinical coordinator will work with the administrative team to secure an affiliation, however, t he outcome is not guaranteed. Students will receive correspondence from the FNP Faculty Clinical coordinator with information regarding their assigned clinical site and preceptor before the start of the term, when possible. o While every effort is made to achieve 100% successful placement, on -time placement is not guaranteed. Placement delays include but are not limited to lack of available preceptors, extensive onboarding requirements, insufficient medical records, unexpected public health restrictions, et c. Students are expected to respond to communication regarding clinical placements within 48 business hours o Failure to respond to communication pertaining to a clinical placement can result in unfavorable consequences including but not limited to a delayed start and loss of a clinical placement Health and Other Requirements Vaccinations, Boosters, and Titers (Evidence of Immunity): 1.

If a site requires additional prerequisites including but not limited to additional titers, EHR training, orientation, completion of web -based modules, etc. this must be completed at the student's expense and done prior to beginning a clinical rotation. o Hours spent on these processes are not counted as part of your clinical hours. Clinical hours are defined as direct patient care time: Hours in which direct clinical care is provided to individuals, families, and groups in one of the population focused areas of NP practice and in primary care or acute care as appropriate It is the student's resp onsibility to maintain communication with the site and placement team and ensure prerequisite training and documentation is completed to the site's satisfaction. All communication pertaining to the clinical site must be sent via a UCI email address and res ponses must be received within 48 hours (about 2 days) Failure to meet site requirements or maintain communication with assigned preceptor/clinical site may result in loss of clinical placement 45 IF placement is lost due to student unresponsiveness or unprof essional behavior, it is the student's responsibility to secure an alternate preceptor at a UCI affiliated site meeting program requirements for placement Students must attend clinical rotations as scheduled and must arrange alternate plans when a precepto r is absent from the clinical site. Students must attend the clinical seminar sessions as scheduled. Students must wear their UCI name badge and lab coat during clinical rotations. Students must introduce themselves as a Nurse Practitioner Student to the patient prior to conducting the patient encounter. Students must notify the FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator immediately of any problems that arise while in the clinical setting. Equipment: Pre paring for Clinical Rotations 1. UCI ID/ nametag to be always worn while in clinical settings 2. UCI White lab coat (3/4 length), clean and pressed 3. Stethoscope 4. Watch with second hand 5. Minimal money 6. Clinical Documents: Typhon patient case logs, H & P or Progress Note templates, etc. 7. References : bring your own reference books and/or electronic devices 8. Do not enter patient data while in clinic unless you have approval from your preceptor. 9. All patient information data must be de -identified. 10. Professional attire (scrubs are unacceptable unless specifically requested by one's preceptor) Clinical Experience Requirements While in the clinical practicum courses, students should expect to spend several da ys per week in clinical. Most clinical sites operate between the hours of 8 -5pm Monday through Friday; however, providers may split their days commonly working in four -hour blocks, hold hours in the evening, or on weekends. Students are expected to be avai lable when their preceptor can accommodate them in the clinical setting while enrolled in a practicum course. o Students must be enrolled to participate in direct patient care Students may not attend clinical after the course has ended unles s the student has a documented \"incomplete\" for the course, is actively enrolled in the DNP - FNP program, and has approval from the FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator and Student Affairs. o Students may not attend clinical prior to the start of the term. o Students may not attend clinic during required synchronous class time without specific permission from their faculty of record o Students cannot attend clinic between academic quarters or when the University is closed for a holiday. 720 direct patient care hours are required for program completion in the DNP -FNP track see appendix E for details. 46 o All hours must be accounted for on a preceptor signed clinical log and within the student tracking system for health education with all required patient demographic , payer, and visit information reported The minimum patient encounter goal for all students is 700. All patient encounters must be recorded with required demographics , payer type, and visit details in Typhon, the student tracking system for health education. o To obtain credit for direct patient care hours, demographic, payer, and visit details must be documented in the student tracking system. The expectation is that students see one to two patients an hour at minimum, as time management is an essential skill for advance practice registered nurses in the FNP concentration . Students are expected to start their clinical hours by Week 2 of the quar ter. Every attempt should be made to evenly distribute the scheduling of clinical hours to span the entire quarter. This ensures that appropriately paced clinical learning can occur throughout the 10-week course. o Exceptions may be made at the discretion o f the Preceptor, Faculty of record, and FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator in the face of extenuating circumstance Clinical Preceptors A major part of the clinical learning is accomplished under the direction of the community preceptor who is trained and c linically active in the provision of health care services. The preceptor helps the student learn clinical skills while applying didactic knowledge to the clinical setting. Ideally, students will be placed with a NP; however, students may be placed with other care providers. NP students may be precepted by a board - certified (AANP or ANCC) Nurse Practitioner (NP), Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM), Medical Doctor (MD), or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO). NP students may also be precepted by licensed clinical professionals such as PAs, Optometrists, Podiatrists, Clinical Nurse Specialists, etc., on a case -by-case basis and as approved by the FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator. Clinical preceptors for the program provide experience in performing the diagnostic and treatment procedures necessary for nurse practitioner practice. It is the goal of the program to educate the student to work within an interdisciplinary team consisting of the NP, PA, physician, and/or other healthcare professionals such as physical therapists, pharmacists, mental health professionals, case managers, and social workers, along with the patient and their family, sharing knowledge and responsibility for patient care. Nurse Practitioner clinical preceptors must hold an active RN licensure, NP certificate, and NP furnishing number. It is preferred that NP preceptors hold board certification in their area of specialty. Certified Nurse Midwives must hold an active RN licensure, CNM certificate, and CNM furnishing number. CNMs must ho ld national certification. Physician clinical preceptors must hold an active MD or DO licensure, board certification in the area of specialty is preferred A ll other licensed healthcare professionals that may precept with must hold an active California license in their discipline and appropriate board certification. 47 Evaluation 1. The preceptor shall contribute to the practicum grade by evaluating the student at the end of the clinical rotation; we also encourage students to ask preceptors for feedback on their performance mid -way through the quarter , however, the final clinical grade/evaluation is the responsibility of the course Faculty of Record. 2. The student shall evaluate the preceptor and clinical site at the end of the practicum. 3. The Faculty of Record shall review all student and preceptor evaluations at the end of the quarter. a. Any concerns regarding a student's attainment of competency and/or satisfactory performance in clinical will be brought to the Faculty Clinical Coordinator. 4. The Clinical Instructor and/or Faculty will also conduct site visits, interviews, and maintain regular communication with preceptors throughout the quarter to ensure students are progressing as expected. Clinical Preceptor Role & Responsibilities Serving as role models and supervisors for students during clinical rotation, preceptors must guide students in the clinical setting by performing the following responsibilities: 1. Provide adequate clinical space for the student to see patients in their setting 2. Provide a variety of patient encounters for the student to have a balanced learning experience in primary care 3. Supervise, demonstrate, teach, and observe the student in clinical activities to develop the student's skills and to ensure appropriate patient care a. All intimate physical exams must be chaperoned by a licensed clinician 4. Delegate assignments gradually, increasing levels of responsibility to the student for the c linical assessment and management of patients as the student's skills develop 5. Allow the student to document, as appropriate, in the patient charts or electronic health record (EHR) or use a chart note simulation in cases in which students may not record th e encounter in patient medical records or the EHR 6. Review and, if necessary, add information to the student's entry in patient charts/EHR and co - sign all patient records/EHR written by the student 7. Participate in the evaluation of the student's clinical skills and didactic knowledge base by: giving direct supervision and observation in the clinical setting giving feedback to the student based on the oral case presentation reviewing the student's chart notes/EHR discussing the student's progress with faculty electronically, by phone, email, or in person during site visits a. Students should have a clear understanding of their performance throughout the quarter, so their final evaluation is of no surprise completing a written (online) evaluation of student 8. Students may NOT make care management recommendations to patients or initiate treatment without prior preceptor discussion/review, including diagnostic tests, medications, or referrals 48 Professional Conduct in Clinical Rotations All students are expected to interact in a professional, courteous, and responsible manner with staff, patients, colleagues, and visitors in the clinical setting. As a UCI DNP/ FNP student, you are an ambassador for the university and will be representing yourself as a future nurse leader and DNP. Adherence to the American Nursing Association (ANA) Code of Ethics and the Standards of Professional Practice is an expectation. The code of ethics will serve as an ethical standard for the profession and will guide the student with ethical analysis and decision - making. ANA CODE OF ETHICS FOR NURSES The nurse practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and unique attributes of every person. The nurse's primary commitment is to the pati ent, whether an individual, family, group, community, or population. The nurse promotes, advocates for, and protects the rights, health, and safety of the patient. The nurse has authority, accountability, and responsibility for nursing practice; makes decisions; and acts consistent with the obligation to promote health and to provide optimal care. The nurse owes the same duties to self as to others, including the responsibility to promote health and safety, preserve wholeness of character and integrity, maintain competence, and continue personal and professional growth. The nurse, through individual and collective effort, establishes, maintains, and improves the ethical environment of the work setting and conditions of employment that are conducive to safe, quality health care. The nurse, in all roles and settings, advances the profession through research and scholarly inquiry, professional standards development, and the generation of both nursing and health policy. The nurse collaborates with other health professionals and the public to protect human rights, promote health diplomacy, and reduce health disparities. The profession of nursing, collectively through its professional organizations, must articulate nursing values, maintain the integrity of the profe ssion, and integrate principles of social justice into nursing and health policy PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION & BEHAVIOR In addition to adhering to the ANA Code of Ethics and Standards for Professional Practice, the student must adhere to all policies outlined in the UCI Code of Student Conduct. These Policies address the rights and responsibilities of members of the University community as well as others while on University property. These Policies also address the responsibilities of students as defined herein and provide University wide standards for campus implementing regulations as a means of sustaining this community. Each member of the University shares in the responsibility for maintaining this unique community so that the University's mission of teaching, research, and public service can be achieved. These Policies and their campus implementing regulations are designed to protect and promote the rights of members of the University, prevent interference with university functions 49 or activities, and assure compliance with all pertinent laws and other app licable University policies. PROFESSIONALISM IN THE CLINICAL SETTING Students will be provided with clinical syllabi and objectives for each quarter. These documents are to be shared with your preceptors at the beginning of the rotation. Students are to a ssume responsibility for patients only in the designated program settings and under approved supervision. Students are not permitted to initiate care of a patient without the direct supervision of their preceptor. An infraction of this policy is cause for dismissal from the program. 1. Introduce yourself to all staff in the clinical environment and be sure you introduce yourself as a nurse practitioner student. 2. Dress: must follow Professional Attire Guidelines; see below. 3. Punctuality is essential. Arrive early (suggest arriving 15 minutes early for your clinical day); plan for traffic, etc. 4. Review patient schedule: look up diagnoses and labs before the patient encounters when possible. 5. Preceptors may give students assignments such as research on a particular diagnosis, management of disease, treatment guidelines, etc. It is expected that the student completes these assignments as directed by preceptors. Failure to do so will be reflected on your evaluation. 6. Obtain a cell phone number or contact number of the preceptor/clinic in case of absence. You must inform the preceptor prior to the scheduled rotation AND notify the FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator AND the faculty of record for the clinical course in case of absence. 7. Do not conduct personal or business pho ne calls during your clinical time; this is your time to LEARN; make the most of each day in your clinical experience. Turn all cell phones to SILENT mode. 8. Take initiative and be an assertive, adult learner\u2014 students are encouraged to ask to observe cases o r procedures; always be respectful of patients/colleagues. 9. Be prepared with clinical notes and resources (books, electronic devices). Do not expect the preceptor to have resource material for you to utilize. 10. Conclude your rotation with a meeting with your preceptor to discuss your clinical progress throughout the rotation. A farewell thank- you note is always appreciated as preceptors have VOLUNTEERED their time to mentor you. PROFESSIONAL DRESS AND PERSONAL APPEARANCE Refer to the UCI SON Dress Code Policy A. General Dress Guidelines 1. Student appearance reflects the individual, the School of Nursing, and the University of California, Irvine. A professional, neat, and well- groomed appearance must be maintained at all times. 2. A white lab coat will be purchased by the student through a UCI School of Nursing vendor which will be embroidered with the University name. a. Professional business type attire is required for clinical rotations. Casual attire is not acceptable such as stretch pants/leggings, \"skinny jeans,\" jeans/denim, 50 Capri pants, open toe shoes/flip flops, hats. Scrubs should only be worn if specifically asked. b. Appropriate attire includes shirt and tie, long pants. Dress or sk irt of appropriate length (remember you will be sitting on an exam stool) or dress pants and blouse. 3. Wear comfortable, closed -toed shoes in the clinical areas ( no sandals ). 4. UCI School of Nursing name badges must be worn with the white lab coat in clinical settings. 5. All clothing should be clean, neat, free of wrinkles, and properly fitted. B. Other Grooming and Personal Appearance Guidelines 1. Hair should be clean and arranged neatly. 2. Appropriate standards of bathing and grooming are expected. 3. Beards/mustaches must be short and neatly trimmed. 4. Nails should be kept clean and short; nail polish should be light -colored or neutral; artificial nails (acrylic or other) are prohibited per UCI policy. 5. Extreme styles of dress, hairdos, and makeup are not permitted. 6. Students should only wear limited, non -obtrusive jewelry in the clinical setting, the student must be cognizant of safety risks imposed by the jewelry. 7. Some clinical sites may have other guidelines pertaining to grooming. As a visitor to such sites, students must also adhere to their guidelines. Tattoos and piercings may be required to be covered by clothing/adhesive. 8. Avoid perfumes, colognes, lotions, and body sprays. Attendance Policy Consistent, punctual, and regular attendance to all clinical and cours e days is an essential requirement of the program. Students must present to clinic on time, prepared, and ready to begin patient care. Students are expected to remain at the clinical site for the duration of their preceptor's workday. It is an expectation that students schedule any personal or medical appointments on days and times that do not conflict with class or clinical days. Students must comply with the attendance policy as it is outlined below: Attendance on each scheduled practicum day is expected unless the student has notified the preceptor, faculty of record, and the FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator of an excused absence prior to the beginning of the workday (Refer to the attendance policy) o Unexpected absences should be reported as soon as possible to the preceptor, faculty of record, and FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator Inconsistent attendance to clinical may jeopardize the students' acquisition of knowledge and skills, impede progression in the program, and result in an \"Unsatisfactory\" evaluation for the rotation. If a student misses a clinical day for an unavoidable and serious reason, an excused absence can be obtained. If a student maintains employment, flexibility with scheduling is necessary to fulfill clinical and academic requirements. Work obligations are not excused absences. 51 Failure to comply with the attendance policy may result in appropriate corrective action, including and not limited to failure of the clinical practicum course. Patient Privacy and Social Networking HIPAA prohibits sharing of a patient's medical information in all settings and violation may result in federal penalty, including sharing identifiable patient information during clinical seminar discussions. You may not take pictures of a patient's condition i n the clinical setting. Information about patients should be shared only with your professional colleagues on a need -to-know basis and this should be done in professional/ private settings. Do not discuss any patient information in public places such as hallways or break rooms. Sharing of patient information in public places (i.e., with friends, on social networking sites, etc.) is a breach of confidentiality and violates patient privacy laws and will not be tolerated. Incidents in Clinical Settings It is the student's responsibility to report any problems that are encountered in clinical immediately. The student will be counseled by the Faculty of Record and/or FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator and corrective action will be taken. As stipulated in the DN P program disqualification policy, students may be dismissed from the program for unprofessional conduct in the clinical practicum rotation. Examples of such conduct may include, but are not limited to unprofessional conduct in the clinic setting including consistent lack of punctuality, frequent unexcused absences, unprofessional attire, dismissal from a clinical site for HIPPA violations, unsafe practices, violation of a clinical contract and disrespectful behavior/encounters with members of the healthcar e team etc. Academic conditional status and/or academic disqualification will result if there is failure to pass the clinical practicum with an 83.5% (Satisfactory) or higher. Standardized Patient Exams Clinical competency performance exams: Skills Appraisal Exam (SKA), Objective Structured Clinical Exams (OSCEs), and Clinical Practice Exams (CPX) are used periodically throughout the program to evaluate student's progress toward achieving clinical competencies. The use of these standardized patient exams follows national best practices as defined by the National Task Force and in alignment with the 2022 Standards for Quality Nurse Practitioner Education are not included in the minimum direct patient care hours. Scoring of these exams is done by trained standardized patients and/or faculty observation. In the event a student does not demonstrate baseline competencies at the expected level on the first attempt at a SKA or OSCE, the Faculty of Record will develop a remediation plan with the student for succes sful achievement of competencies. Remediation plans are to be determined by the faculty of record in conjunction with the Faculty Clinical Coordinator and may include but are not limited to additional clinical hours, repeat assessment, additional in - pers on site visit, etc. 52 The Clinical Practice Examination (CPX) is a comprehensive performance (practical) exam administered in the last quarter and is used as one measure of a student's overall competency prior to graduation. It is an exam utilizing standardized patients. Students are required to perform an appropriate history, physical exam, and psychosocial assessment, and create a diagnos is and management plan. In the event the student does not demonstrate baseline competency at the expected level on the CPX (Clinical Practice Exam) , the student will be required to remediate as determined by the faculty of record in conjunction with the Faculty Clinical Coordinator and complete a re -examination. Failure to pass the re - exam will result in a failure of t he course. If the SKA, OSCE, or CPX is missed for any reason, the course requirements will be considered unmet. If the absence is excused by the faculty of record, a make- up OSCE must be arranged, and a passing grade obtained to complete the course and pr ogress in the program. It is understood that the need to take the CPX at an alternative date and time may delay graduation. Practicum Evaluation Each practicum course must be passed with an 83.5% (Satisfactory) or better. The student's final evaluation is completed by the Faculty of Record utilizing multiple evaluation methods which may include standardized patient exams, preceptor evaluations, faculty site visits observations, and assignments by the Faculty of Record as outlined in the practicum syllabus. Students must complete the clinical hour requirements for each practicum by the date specified in the syllabus to obtain a satisfactory grade in the course . Remediation and Grounds for Dismissal and Academic Disqualification in Practicums Students must pass both the preceptor evaluation and standardized patient exam for each clinical practicum with an 83.5% or higher. Failure to pass either the standardized patient exam or the preceptor evaluation will require remediation at faculty discretio n, which may include repeating additional clinical hours. Prior to graduation students are required to take and pass a written comprehensive exam with an adjusted score of 83.5% or higher. Failure to pass will require remediation at faculty discretion, w hich may include repeating additional course work, clinical hours, practice tests, and the comprehensive exam. Failure of any clinical practicum course will result in academic conditional status. Failure of a second course in the program is grounds for a cademic disqualification from the program. Additionally, unprofessional behavior resulting in dismissal from a clinical site is grounds for dismissal from the program. Faculty Clinical Site Visit The FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator or designated clinical instructor or faculty within Nursing Science will periodically schedule site visits, virtually or in -person, to observe and evaluate the physical site, interaction between the preceptor, student and patients, and the student's clinical progress. It is als o an opportunity to work with the preceptor toward the development of the student's clinical skills. During the site visit, the NP Faculty may observe the student in patient encounters, during presentation of cases to preceptor, and will review charting. A written report will be completed by the faculty and placed in the student's file in Typhon. In the event the faculty evaluation documents the student is 53 below level of expected performance, the faculty will discuss the results with the student, preceptor, faculty of record, and the FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator and a remediation plan will be developed. Record Keeping 1. A schedule for the clinical rotation for the entire quarter should be mapped out and submitted to the faculty of record to ensure timely completion of all required clinical hours. 2. Typhon NPST system is used to track the Clinical Preceptorship information. Students will be trained in the use of this web -based clinical preceptorship tracking system and will be required to input clinical and patient data daily. Students will not be authorized to input data after 7 days. If not done in this timeframe, the student will lose the time and patient encounters for the omitted day(s). 3. All clinical hours must be completed by the end of the quarter. Failure to complete clinical hours in a particular population may result in delayed program progression. a. Direct Patient Care Time as defined by National Task Force on Quality Nurse Practitioner Education (2021) as Hours/time in which direct clinical care is provided to individuals, families, and groups in one (1) of the six (6) population -focused areas of NP practice and in primary care or acute care as appropriate 4. Inaccurate and/or falsified data entry on clinical logs or in the Typhon NPST system will be considered academic dishonesty and will be reported to the UCI Office of Academic Integrity & Student Conduct and may result in academic disqualification or academic conditional status. 5. Students will evaluate each preceptor and site once during the quarter for each clinical rotation; evaluations must be completed by the designated due date. 6. All records must be submitted at the end of each quarter. Failure to do so will result in an \"Unsatisfactory\" grade for the clinical rotation. Expo sure Guidelines to Bloodborne Pathogens (BBP) and Other Potentially Infectious material (OPIM) Participation in direct patient care activities can pose a risk to health care professionals, particularly in terms of exposure to infectious and/or communicable diseases. Costs of testing, diagnosis, and treatment of any infection and/or communicable diseases will be the responsibility of the student. As licensed registered nurses, graduate nursing students have current knowledge of universal safety precautions . It is expected that all students strictly adhere to practices and principles of universal precautions, and routinely use appropriate barrier precautions and appropriate safety devices when occupational exposure to blood borne pathogens and other potentia lly infectious material is likely. Students must maintain adequate health insurance through the academic school year as a prerequisite for clinical placements and as a non -academic condition of enrollment. Whenever in a clinical placement site, students are advised to keep their health insurance cards with them. Upon receipt of the Nurse Practitioner Track Student Guidelines for Clinical Rotations, students must sign a receipt acknowledging that they have read the guidelines and intend to follow them. The receipt then becomes part of their file. 54 IF A STUDENT IS INJURED WHILE IN CLINICAL: 1. The student should immediately notify the clinical preceptor and the FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator and/or Faculty of Record for the course. 2. If necessary, the student will be excused from clinical for the day to seek medical treatment. The student remains responsible to fulfill all required clinical hours during the quarter. 3. If required, emergency care may be provided directly at the clinical site, at the stud ent's expense. 4. The student is responsible for contacting his/her own health care provider following emergent care to arrange for post -injury follow -up. 5. A needle stick is considered an urgent medical concern (see post -exposure guidelines below). 6. All costs that are associated with the immediate and/or follow -up treatment are the responsibility of the student. POST -EXPOSURE GUIDELINES: BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS If a student comes in contact with another person's blood or body fluid (e.g., through a needle stick injury, contact with skin, or mucous membrane splash), take the following steps: 1. Immediately clean wound site with antiseptic soap and flush area with water. Notify preceptor immediately. 2. Any student exposed to blood or body fluid from a patient must be evaluated within one -hour post -exposure to obtain the most effective early prophylaxis. Preceptor should consult with the nursing supervisor or medical director immediately for facility's process. Students will be excused from clinical for the day to seek treatment as indicated. Clinical hours missed must be made up later in the quarter. 3. After the exposure, the student should document the date and time, patient's name, identification number, and the clinical site in which the exposure occurred. Keep this information in a secure place. This information should be utilized to complete an incident report per facility requirements. In addition, immediately contact the nursing supervisor or medical director at the clinical site and provide the supervisor or director with the information pertaining to the blood borne exposure and source patient. If there is a UC Irvine faculty member on -site, s/he should be notified about the incident immediately . The nursing supervisor or medical director should request and obtain a source patient blood sample for Hepatitis B screening, Hepatitis C screening, and HIV screening. The nursing supervisor or medical director is authorized to release the results of the blood tests to the student. The student is responsible for contacting the supervisor or director to obtain this information. **Note that post- exposure guidelines will vary among clinical sites and agencies; additionally, some clinical venues will have limited ability for on -site laboratory testing. Follow the agency guidelines for the site where the exposure occurs. Should the injury take place at UCIMC or a UCI Healthcare Facility during clinical: post - exposure care is provided by Occupational Health Services during business hours. The student is to demonstrate insurance coverage and is responsible for any costs that may be incurred for post -exposure treatment. If the incident occurs after hours or on weekends/holidays, the House Supervisor will page the Infectious Disease Fellow on -call to review the details of the incident and estimate the risk of exposure. The Infectious Disease Fellow will discuss the incident, counsel the student, and will call the House Supervisor to order the HIV test on the sour ce patient, if indicated. The University of California, Irvine 55 Healthcare has a Policy and Procedure for EXPOSURE: BLOODBORNE PATHOGEN PREVENTION AND CONTROL PLAN , (2017). Should the injury take place at any other facility other than UCI Health during cl inical: For cases of exposure occurring outside of UCI, the student should still follow steps #1 -3 above. UCIMC will not be able to obtain the source patient's lab results. The student is responsible for obtaining these as discussed above. Post -exposure gu idelines will vary among clinical sites and agencies; additionally, some clinical venues will have limited ability for on -site laboratory testing. Follow the agency guidelines for the site where the exposure occurs. Post -exposure prophylaxis shall be provided when medically indicated per CDC general guidelines and as prescribed for the individual student by the Occupational Health advanced practice provider, Infectious Disease advanced practice provider, or Emergency Room advanced practice provider. For students with private health insurance : Students may see their personal health care provider for post -exposure evaluation and care. There may be fees for the office visits, lab tests, medications and other procedures which are the responsibility of the student. The students' private insurance carrier may be billed; however, if the student's insurance will not accept the facilities' services, s/he must follow their carrier's accepted protocol and s/he will be responsible for the cost. Again, it is the student's responsibility to know his/her benefits, exclusions, and limitations. Most insurance plans have provisions which include the need to report the injury to the insurance company within a brief period after the in jury. 4. The student must follow -up with their healthcare provider through the \"window period\" as appropriate: 72 hours (about 3 days), 6 weeks (about 1 and a half months), 12 weeks (about 3 months) and 6 months. Refer to CDC guidelines for bloodborne pathogen post -exposure care. 5. The student must contact his/her healthcare provider if any of the tests are positive and must provide them with the supporting documentation. The students' primary healthcare provider should provide post -test counseling and appropr iate intervention. 6. Within 24 hours of the incident, the student should notify the UC Irvine School of Nursing FNP Faculty Clinical Coordinator and/or the Faculty of Record for the course.

These resources may be accessed directly from any of the UCI computer networks, and remotely via simple authentication using your UCINetID. - 4 - The VPN (Virtual Private Network) - https://www.lib.uci.edu/connect i. You may connect to these online resources from off -campus using the VPN. We strongly suggest using the software option (Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client) which is available for current Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. There are also options available for several popular mobile devices (iOS, Android, Chromebook). This option will give you access to the largest number of our online resources from home, or your favorite coffee shop. For more information on obtaining and installing the VPN software go toh ttps://www.oit.uci.edu/help/vpn/ . Follow the installation instructions clos ely. Be sure to select UCIFULL (Route all traffic through the UCI VPN) from the Group drop -down menu the first time that you open the VPN software after installation. ii. A second option is the WebVPN. This merely requires that you go to the webpage at https://vpn.nacs.uci.edu/ and login with your UCINetID. You will then be taken to a second webpage with links back to the UCI Libraries. We do not encourage this option as there are some resources, notably PubMed, that may not work well (or at all) with the WebVPN. However, this may be the only method to use if you are not able to install the VPN software on the device you are using such as a computer at a public library, hospital computer lab, etc. iii.

National Organization for Nurse Practitioner Faculties (NONPF) DNP Scholarly Recommendations NONPF Recommended Criteria for NP Scholarly Projects in the Practice Doctorate Program 1. The project is related to advanced practice in the nursing specialty and benefits a group, population or community rather than an individual patient. Often arises from clinical practice May be done in partnership with another entity: clinical agency, school, health department, church, government, voluntary organization or community group, etc. 2. The project leadership may be solo or collaborative depending on scope of the project and university requirements. 3. The scholarly project addresses identified needs. 4. The literature review suggests an evidence base for the projec t or supports the need for the project. 5. Description of the innovation is adequate for others to use (essential components for success, cost, etc.) 6. A systematic approach is used and data are collected using methods and tools that meet accepted standards. 7. Expected outcomes are defined and measured (quality improvement, cost savings, etc.). 8. The project is conducted according to ethical principles. 9. Dissemination modes are professional and public (peer review is included). Types of Scholarly Projects include but are not limited to: The following includes a list of general topics and the grouping of projects by category. This is not an exhaustive list of projects or of categories. Evaluate interventions, innovations in care techniques Obtain baseline data, design an evidence -based intervention and plan and evaluate Collaborate with other NPs or other professional colleagues to compare/ evaluate group visits Capture data on common problems and effectiveness of treatments with recommendations for change Evaluate management of psychiatric patients (protocols, meds, metabolic monitoring) Evaluate peer led support groups and their impact Evaluate pain contro l in palliative care Promote patient safety by reducing errors in medications Evaluate home care comparing satisfaction with physician and NP care Health Promotion & Community Health: Epidemiology and Continuity of Care Compare strategies for healt h promotion / disease prevention (community, schools, churches, etc.) Identify trends in patient visits, outreach programs Launch collaborative new health promotion program in vulnerable community population and evaluate it Develop and evaluate mon itoring tools or screening programs - 8 - Evaluate screening protocols Evaluate programs (care, training volunteers, education) Evaluate community responses to disasters Develop and evaluate the impact of self- care models Develop and test transition pr otocols to promote continuity of care across settings Evaluate high -risk patients and develop approaches for risk reduction (child and elder abuse) for policy or care improvement Policy- Related Scholarly Projects Implement new policy collaboratively by designing and evaluating HPV vaccination for 6th grade girls to prevent cancer (partnering with School/ Health Dept., etc.) Evaluate or compare nursing home policies for treating chronic pain Evaluate students at risk (school dropouts, depressed, substance users, pregnant) and recommend policy change, programs Evaluate employer policies regarding health and potential cost savings of new policies Evaluate the effect of evidence -based policy in NICU Evaluate inconsistencies in scope of practice issues and use evidence - based knowledge and to recommend changes Integration of Technology in Care and Informatics Related Projects Create a database for monitoring childhood injuries in urgent care and evaluate its impact Use tec hnology to improve care (telehealth consultation, interactive \"home\" visits, etc.) and evaluate results Evaluate technology's impact on care (information transfer to point of care, etc. ) Establish protocols that integrate use of technology in patient assessment in urgent care and evaluate their impact Acknowledgment: The above examples were developed and generalized from several sources including publications, web sites, and information shared by deans of various Nursing Practice Doctorate programs. Some examples were common to several schools and others were unique to specific programs. NONPF would like to acknowledge the following schools whose projects are reflected in the list above: Medical College of Georgia; Rush University; Oregon Health and S cience University; University of Tennessee, Memphis; University of Arizona; University of Kentucky; and University of Washington.

We are thrilled you are joining us; here is some information about your clinical experiences that begin in your 2nd year, winter quarter. Your first clinical rotation will begin in January of your second year. The University of California, Irvine takes pride in selecting and overseeing preceptors and managing student preceptorships to ensure high quality clinical experiences; it is a role we take very seriously. We have some clinical placements available to students in the Orange County area and surrounding counties; however, to make certain each student receives ample clinical experiences, we are asking each student to identify 2 preceptors to augment your clinical learning experie nces. One preceptor will ideally be in a primary care clinical site (family medicine/practice, internal medicine, geriatrics and/or a community clinic), the other should be a preceptor who provides obstetrical (pre -natal) care to women or pediatrics. We have had significant challenges identifying preceptors for our students' OB -pediatrics rotations and as a family nurse practitioner, pre - and post -natal care and pediatrics are an essential experience in your scope of practice. Students may be precepted by MD's, DO's, NP's, and/or CNM's. Examples of clinical settings include community clinics, private practice sites, group practices, and HMOs. Your clinical rotation experience will begin with primary care. Additional rotations, such as primary care pediatrics and women's health and obstetrics, will follow. The following information will assist you in this effort: Suggestions for clinical sites might be your own personal clinician, colleague, or other acquaintances. Most hospital physicians, with whom you may work, have an outpatient practice, and may consider precepting an NP student, or may help you to network with colleagues. Preceptors are expected to precept a student for 8 -16 hours a week (1 -2 days) for 10 weeks (about 2 and a half months) per quarter . Ideally, a student should remain in the same site for two quarters (5 -6 months). Preceptors are expected to carry malpractice insurance for themselves and their practices. All students have UCI malpractice insurance which provides coverage only in UCI af filiated clinical sites. You will also be required to purchase your own individual professional malpractice coverage. UCI requires that we have an affiliation agreement with each clinical practice. The affiliation agreement will be facilitated by Lila S apolu, Operational Support Analyst, and the process may take up to 6 months to complete -- so please bear this in mind. The preceptor experience is NOT simply a \"tag -along\" observational experience; the usual routine is for the student to observe the preceptor (the first day or so), and then the student is expected to gradually increase autonomy in patient care through the quarter, under direct supervision of the preceptor. All medical records will be signed by your preceptor and feedback from the preceptor is expected to make sure the student is progressing. If you identify a potential preceptor, please complete the New Preceptor and Clinical Site Form and email to Candice Whealon. The SON will contact the potential preceptor directly to discuss d etails. We appreciate your commitment to a rewarding clinical experience as a nurse practitioner student. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us. - 13 - APPENDIX I : NEW PRECEPTOR AND CLINICAL SITE INFORMATION FORM YESNO YESNO YESNO YESNO ADMIN RECEIVED DATE / INITIAL ________________Address: Type of Facility: Type of Practice:Private Practice?
