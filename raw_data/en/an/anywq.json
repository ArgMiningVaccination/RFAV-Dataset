Our Current Studies [A Pilot Investigation of Emergent Multi-Class Imitation Training](/documents/csh/EMIT-Recruitment-Flyer-Revised-Nov-2022.pdf) (age 5 or younger): Rutgers University is evaluating a comprehensive intervention protocol designed to rapidly teach imitation to young children diagnosed with an ASD. They are seeking children age 5 or younger with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder who are minimally vocal (more details in flyer hyperlinked in title). For more information, please contact Dr. Meghan Deshais at [m.deshais@rutgers.edu](mailto:m.deshais@rutgers.edu). [A Pilot/Feasibility Study of the Use of High Dose Propranolol to Treat Severe and Chronic Challenging Behaviors in Adolescents and Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders](/documents/csh/Interventional-Research-Protocol.pdf) (12-30 years): Rutgers University (RWJMS) is examining the efficacy of propranolol to treat severe and chronic challenging behaviors in adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder. They are seeking children and adults (12-30 years old) with a diagnosis of autism to participate in a double-blind study.

(age 4 months): ](/documents/csh/ISL-FLYER-EIRB-ASD-VERSION-2020.5).pdf)Experience with sound cues may strengthen abilities important for language in infants at familial risk for autism. The infancy studies laboratory (ISL) at Rutgers-Newark is inviting siblings of children with autism to participate in an interactive, baby-friendly game that encourages them to discriminate between brief sounds that become increasingly faster and more complex. The study begins at age 4 months and compensation up to $400.00 will be provided for study completion. For more information, please email us at [babylab@newark.rutgers.edu](mailto:babylab@newark.rutgers.edu), or visit the ISL website: [https://www.babylab.rutgers.edu](https://www.babylab.rutgers.edu/) and [watch a video](https://youtu.be/OSZJrnsw7jw).
