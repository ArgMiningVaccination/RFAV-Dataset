An additional important strategy to remain healthy is to support your immune system with the right nutrients. [Significant research](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/health-disease/immunity) shows that certain vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids play important roles in immunity. These nutrients support the specialized defenses that keep viruses and bacteria out of our bodies, destroy invaders that enter, and assist with recovery from illness and infection. Many nutrients form the foundation of a healthy immune system. If you fall short of any of these nutrients highlighted here, you have more risk for serious illness and infection. Do your usual food choices meet our recommendations on this list? Contact a [registered](https://www.eatright.org/find-an-expert) [ dietitian nutritionist](https://www.eatright.org/find-an-expert) (RDN) to see how your daily diet measures up. If you think you are falling short, be sure to check the \"Where can I get more?\" section of the table. We list a few food examples to help you get started, but the LPI has nutrition information for many additional foods at its [Micronutrient Information Center](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic). If you already know that your body is low in a specific nutrient, such as iron in the case of anemia, focus on that nutrient first. If you have anemia... Anemia weakens the immune system. Low folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, or iron can all be possible causes. If you have anemia, work with your doctor to determine which nutrients might help you resolve it as soon as possible. | | Nutrient | | The LPI | | Where can I get more? | | DHA | | Men & Women: Eat two servings of oily fish every week | | 1 large egg 30 mg | | Vitamin A | | Men: 900 \u00b5g/day | | 1 large egg 80 \u00b5g | | Vitamin C | | Men & Women: 400 mg/day | | 1 cup bell pepper 120-190 mg | | Vitamin D | | Men & Women: 2,000 IU/day | | 3 oz salmon 300-500 IU | | Vitamin E | | Men & Women: 15 mg/day | | \u00bd cup almonds 10-12 mg | | Folate or Folic Acid | | Men & Women: 400 \u00b5g/day | | 1 cup cooked lentils 180 \u00b5g | | Vitamin B12 | | Men & Women: 2.4 \u00b5g/day | | 3 oz beef 3-6 \u00b5g | | Vitamin B6 | | Men & Women: 1.3 mg/day | | 3 oz chicken 0.5 mg | | Zinc | | Men: 11 mg/day | | 3 oz beef 4-9 mg | | Iron | | Men: 8 mg/day | | 3 oz beef 1.5-2.5 mg | | Copper | | Men & Women: 900 \u00b5g/day | | 1 oz dark chocolate 500 \u00b5g | | Selenium | | Men & Women: 55 \u00b5g/day | | 3 oz tuna 90 \u00b5g | | These recommendations are for all adults under 50 who are not pregnant or breastfeeding. Adults over 50 may need additional vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 from supplements, and no supplemental iron. See our Amounts of nutrients listed are approximate and can depend on source and preparation. All of the LPI recommendations meet or exceed the recommendations of the National Academy of Medicine. Scroll Down for More While it is best to get most of your nutrients from foods, it is not always possible. The best strategy is to know where you fall short and add supplements to fill the gaps. The experts at the Linus Pauling Institute have identified four \"immune essential\" supplements that all adults should consider taking. Vitamin C, vitamin D, DHA (an omega-3 fatty acid), and zinc all can help our bodies fight off infection. Following our guidelines, you can add one or more of these supplements to help support your immune system. Multivitamins are also important to reach your goals. These supplements can help you reach all of the LPI recommendations, especially for minerals. Most general multivitamins will provide what you need. An expensive brand is not necessarily better. Important: be sure to select the right type for you, such as those for women or older adults. As we get older, our immune system does not function as well as it used to. This is related to not absorbing nutrients from foods as well as younger adults and also needing more nutrients as we age. For these reasons, it is important for older adults to take certain supplements. Therefore, the LPI has set [specific supplement recommendations](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/life-stages/older-adults) for older adults. All of the guidelines listed here will help people over the age of 50 support their immune system. Caution: Older adults should not get too much iron (8 mg/day from food is enough) or zinc (no more than 40 mg/day). In addition to the above, look for the following in your multivitamin supplement: Also, make sure you are getting: Optimal nutrition promotes optimal immune function. To fight viruses and support a strong [immune system](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/health-disease/immunity-in-brief), it is very important to get the nutrients you need to stay healthy. In times of health crisis, we would all do well to follow these general guidelines: eat a balanced diet and take a daily multivitamin. For extra support, consider taking \"immune essential\" supplements, especially older adults.
