Are you having a difficult time gaining weight and keeping it on even though you are eating well? Are you losing weight without trying to and are concerned about becoming underweight or looking too thin? Are you looking to gain weight in a healthy and natural way without consuming junk foods, excessive fats and foods with poor nutritional value? Being underweight has many factors to it: Bulimia is when the individual \"purges\" meaning they eat an excessive amount of food at one time and afterwards purposefully throws up the food. This cycle of overeating and vomiting is quite hard on the body as it can irritate the upper gastrointestinal tract with hydrochloric acid and lead to a loss of potassium and other nutrients. Bulimia may or may not be a part of anorexia nervosa. Treatment for bulimia may require both medical and psychological help. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder which entails loss of appetite due to psychological factors. It mainly affects young women between the ages of 13-25. Those suffering from anorexia nervosa have a distorted view on weight and body image (body dysmorphic syndrome) and often have a significant fear of eating food because of possible weight gain. This is also accompanied by low self-esteem. Anorexics are malnourished and deficient in nutrients and calories. They may also be using laxatives as well as involved with vigorous exercise both of which can lead to a further loss of nutrients. They may also become socially separated for fear of going out in groups and being pressured to eat. This is a serious problem and people suffering from this syndrome should receive treatment immediately with education, emotional support, understanding and food. Since it is most common in teens, this is a concern because this age group requires high nutrition. It is also important not to over-diagnose or over-treat young people who may watch their weight and eat small amounts. Encourage good-quality, low-calorie foods and supplementation. The naturopathic treatments we offer for clients at our naturopathic clinic based in Toronto are for people who want to gain weight in a natural and healthy way, but also want to identify the root cause of their weight issues. The naturopathic program is the opposite of our [weight loss program](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/weight-loss/toronto-weight-loss-centre.html), but with the same emphasis on avoiding junk foods, excessive fats and other poor nutritional choices. People who need to gain weight need to consume much more of the calorie dense healthy foods, which can be a real problem. The naturopathic approach to addressing weight issues includes a thorough assessment to identify what the root cause of the problem maybe and then doing the appropriate tests such as blood to identify any vitamin or mineral deficiencies, hormonal issues and food sensitivities or allergies that maybe affecting your weight. At the clinic, during your initial 1 hour one - on - one consult with our [Naturopathic Doctor, Dr. Sushma Shah](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/meet-our-therapists.html), you will undergo a comprehensive symptom intake in detail, and at the end of the visit, you may be required to do some blood and urine testing. Her assessment is oriented toward determining what is impeding your body's ability to function optimally. She will determine which assessment tools are most helpful in establishing a treatment strategy specific to your health needs. Naturopathic Doctor Sushma Shah may order some specialized testing, if need be in order to get all the necessary physiological information and to get a more complete picture of your symptoms - to get to the root cause of your symptoms. Following this visit, you will be coming in for your second visit, in which she will be doing a full physical check-up, a traditional Chinese medicine tongue and pulse diagnosis, body fat analysis and blood glucose testing. After having gone through your case thoroughly, she will be suggesting an individualised natural treatment plan that is specific to the symptoms you have and your health goals. For those experiencing problems of being underweight, it is important to get a proper medical evaluation / assessment done, especially if the problems are recent. A physical exam and basic blood test may rule out anemia, thyroid issues, and even cancer maybe suggested. Mineral tests and an evaluation of diet may also help in looking for nutritional deficiencies. If thinness runs in the family though, no medical problems will appear on any testing; a fast metabolism and low potential for fat storage is usually the explanation. One of the most important factors when it comes to gaining weight is good nutrition through a proper diet and appropriate supplements (if your body is lacking certain nutrients and vitamins). Dr. Shah, ND firmly believes that supplementation should be through proper nutrition. The foundation of this plan is to consume healthier portions, and meals with extra snacks throughout the day- all being healthy and easily digestible calorie dense foods. People who are underweight and have a difficult time gaining weight may require a combined program; a psychologist, stress counselor or hypnotherapist may be of great use to help deal with psychological, attitudinal or emotional factors that are affecting the person's ability to gain weight. Stress reduction therapies such as acupuncture, massage, meditation, music, relaxation exercises maybe suggested. These are important for nervous and highly stressed individuals or individuals suffering from anxiety as it teaches them to slow down internally and externally helps with the assimilation and metabolism of nutrients. If you have a low risk for cardiovascular issues, with a moderate cholesterol level and good blood pressure, consuming more fats especially monounsaturated helps could be of great use (e.g. olive oil). Usually, underweight people also experience coldness and fatigue more because fat helps to keep us warm, and with low body fat and poor circulation, vitality and warmth are affected. Nutrient deficiencies are also linked with fatigue along with low caloric diets and low intake. Vegetarians and people who consume macrobiotic diets tend to have lower weights, however, they may be healthier weights given they are consuming proper amounts of calories, proteins, and vegetable oils - mostly nutrient-rich foods. However, these diets may lead to deficiencies in calorie intake because most of the food being consumed are low-calorie foods which are used to help in weight loss. It is important for those looking to gain weight to \"live to eat\" rather than to \"eat to live\" at least for the time being in which they are in the process to gain weight. Please ask your doctor or naturopath before starting on any supplements. Its is better to first identify the cause and then treat it with the right remedies, even though those mentioned above have minimal side effects.
