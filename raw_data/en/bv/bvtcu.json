Part I: Etiology and Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS Your client, Mr. Glover, has been diagnosed with HIV. You don't know much about HIV and are concerned whether you can \"catch\" HIV by working with him or even shaking hands. You recognize your need to be better educated so you can give appropriate care without bias or fear. You know that quality care can be given when you have a sound understanding of the disease, risk factors, diagnostics, clinical symptoms, and treatments. Becoming culturally sensitive to the unique needs of your patients requires you to better understand your patient's values, definitions of health and illness, and preferences for care.Definition of HIV and AIDS [Material in this course is from CDC unless otherwise cited.] The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has infected tens of millions of people around the globe in the past three decades, with devastating results. In its advanced stage \u2014acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) \u2014the infected individual has no protection from diseases that may not even threaten people who have healthy immune systems. While medical treatment can delay the onset of AIDS, no cure is available for HIV or AIDS. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) kills or impairs the cells of the immune system and progressively destroys the body's ability to protect itself. Over time, a person with a deficient immune system ( immunodeficiency ) may become vulnerable to common and even simple infections by disease-causing organisms such as bacteria or viruses. These infections can become life-threatening. The term AIDS comes from \"acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\" AIDS refers to the most advanced stage of HIV infection. Medical treatment can delay the onset of AIDS, but HIV infection eventually results in a syndrome of symptoms, diseases, and infections. The diagnosis of AIDS requires evidence of HIV infection and the appear ance of specific conditions or diseases beyond just the HIV infection. Only a licensed medical provider can make an AIDS diagnosis. A key concept is that all people diagnosed with AIDS have HIV, but an individual may be infected with HIV and not yet have AIDS. How HIV Infects the Body HIV enters the bloodstream and seeks out T-helper lymphocytes, which are specialized white blood cells essential to the functioning of the immune system. One of the functions of these cells is to regulate the immune response in the event of attack from disease- causing organisms such as bacteria or viruses. When the virus infects the T -helper lymphocyte, the cell sends signals to other cells, which produce antibodies. This T -helper lymphocyte cell is also known as the T4 or the CD4 cell. Antibodies are produced by the immune system to tag the specific foreign invaders that can cause disease and signal to phagocytic white blood cells where to destro y the pathogens. Producing antibodies is an essential function of our immune system. The body makes a specific antibody for each disease. For example, if we are exposed to the measles virus, the immune system will develop antibodies specifically designed to attack the measles virus. Polio antibodies identify the poliovirus and signal to other white blood cells where they are in the bloodstream so they can be destroyed.When our immune system is working correctly , it protects against these foreign in vaders. HIV infects and destro ys the T -helper lymphocytes and damages their abilit y to signal for antibody production. When this happens, the immune system ev entually becomes ineffectiv e against an y invading pathogen or antigen. There are fiv e stages of HIV/AIDS infection: Primary or Acute HIV Infection Primary or acute HIV infection is the first stage of HIV disease\u2014t ypically lasting only a week or two\u2014 when the virus first establishes itself in the body . This is the period of time between first infection and when the body begins to produce antibodies. The virus is highly infectious but unfortunately not detectable b y any tests. During this primary infection, patients ha ve no symptoms. Primary or acute infection1. The window period ending with serocon version 2. The asymptomatic period3. The symptomatic period4. Full-blown AIDS5.Answer: CTest Your Learning Acute primary HIV infection is: Online Resource Video: How HIV Kills So Many CD4 T Cells https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gnpnUFNloo Window Period The window period is the period of time between initial infection with HIV and the point when the body produces detectable antibodies, which can vary from 2 to 12 weeks. During the window period a person is infectious, with a high viral load, but still presents with a negative HIV antibody test. This means the infected person might get a negative test result while actually having HIV. The point when the HIV antibody test becomes positive is called seroconversion. Patients also may remain asymptomatic during the window period with no clinical manifestations, which decreases patient motivation for testing.

The time when antibodies are first detected.D.Answer: ATest Your Learning The window period: Asymptomatic Stage After the acute stage of HIV infection, people infected with HIV continue to look and feel completely well for long periods, sometimes for man y years. During this time, the virus is replicating and slowly destro ying the immune system. This asymptomatic stage is sometimes referred to as clinical latency . This means that, although a person looks and feels health y, they can infect other people through an y body fluid contact such as unprotected anal, v aginal, or or al sex or through needle sharing. The virus can also be passed from an infected woman to her bab y during pregnancy , birth, or breastfeeding when she is una ware of being HIV positiv e. Unless the infected person is given antiretro viral ther apy, the onset of AIDS occurs an a verage of 10 y ears after being infected with HIV .

Is the first stage of HIV disease.D.Answer: DApply Your Learning Q: If a person has been infected with HIV but is not symptomatic, how would y ou explain this to a patient with HIV? A: Although there ma y be no clinical symptoms, the HIV is replicating and slowly attacking the immune system' s CD4 cells. An untreated person can look and feel health y, sometimes for man y years, howev er the virus is still present in the blood and can cause infection in others. Also , the virus can be passed through unprotected sex and from pregnant or lactating mother to child. Test Your Learning During the asymptomatic state of HIV infection: Symptomatic Stage The symptomatic stage occurs when clinical manifestations appear , including nausea, vomiting, cold and flu-lik e symptoms, weight loss, malaise, and gener al infections. Because these symptoms occur with man y other illnesses, patients don' t recogniz e them as unique to HIV infection and often do not get screened, tested, diagnosed, or treated. Clinical symptoms appear as the body' s immune system can no longer respond effectiv ely to other pathogens because the HIV has tak en over the CD4 lymphocytes. Full-blown AIDS Autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is alw ays caused b y HIV , but HIV is not alw ays in the full state of AIDS . Only after the HIV has completely infected the CD4 cells and used their metabolism and multiplication abilit y is the body' s immune system incapacitated. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 count is less than 200 compared with the normal r ange of 1,000 T cells in health y people. Primary tests for diagnosing HIV and AIDS include a positiv e ELIS A test, vir al load test, or W estern Blot T est.The virus can be passed through unprotected sex, but cannot be passed to a baby through breastfeeding.A. The virus is in the dormant stage and is not replicating.B. People infected with HIV experience frequent illnesses. C. An untreated person can look and feel health y for an a verage of 10 y ears before the start of AIDS symptoms.D.The Origin of HIV Since the human immunodeficiency virus w as identified in 1983, researchers ha ve work ed to pinpoint the origin of the virus. In 1999 an international team of researchers reported that they disco vered the origins of HIV -1, the predominant str ain of HIV in the dev eloped world. A subspecies of chimpanz ees nativ e to W est Equatorial Africa w as identified as the original source of the virus. R esearchers believ e that HIV -1 was introduced into the human population when hunters became exposed to infected blood. The tr ansmission of HIV w as driven from Africa b y migr ation, housing, tr avel, sexual pr actices, drug use, w ar, and economics, which affect both Africa and the entire world. HIV Strains and Subtypes HIV has divided into two primary str ains: HIV-1 and HIV-2 . Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV -1, and gener ally when people refer to HIV without specif ying the t ype of virus they are referring to HIV -1. The relativ ely uncommon HIV -2 type is concentr ated in W est Africa and is r arely found elsewhere. HIV is a highly v ariable virus that mutates v ery readily . This means there are man y different str ains of HIV , even within the body of a single infected person. Based on genetic similarities, the numerous virus str ains ma y be classified into t ypes, groups, and subt ypes. Both HIV -1 and HIV -2 ha ve sev eral subt ypes. It is virtually certain that more undisco vered subtypes are in existence now . It is also probable that more HIV subt ypes will ev olve in the future. As of 2001, blood testing in the United States can detect both str ains and all known subtypes of HIV . Epidemiology of HIV and AIDS Epidemiology is the study of how disease is distributed in populations and the factors that influence the distribution. Epidemiologists try to disco ver wh y a disease dev elops in some people and not in others. Clinically , AIDS w as first recogniz ed in the United States, including the State of W ashington, in 1981. In 1983 HIV w as disco vered to be the cause of AIDS. Since then, the number of AIDS cases has continued to increase, both in the United States and in other countries.People who are infected with HIV come from all r aces, countries, sexual orientations, genders, and income lev els. Globally , most of the people who are infected with HIV ha ve not been tested, and are una ware that they are living with the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention (CDC) estimate that 1.2 million people aged 13 y ears and older are living with HIV infection, including 168,000 (14%) who are una ware of their infection. This is a decline from 25% in 2003 and 20% in 2012, and it is a positiv e sign because studies ha ve shown that people with HIV who know that they are infected a void behaviors that spread infection to others; also , they can get medical care and tak e antivir al medications that could reduce HIV spread b y as much as 96% (CDC, 2016a). CDC estimates that that there are only 4 tr ansmissions per y ear for ev ery 100 people living with HIV in the United States, which means that at least 95% of people living with HIV do not tr ansmit the virus to an yone else. This represents an 89% decline in the tr ansmission rate since the mid-1980s, reflecting the combined impact of testing, prev ention counseling, and treatment efforts targeted to those living with HIV infection (CDC, 2013). The estimated incidence of HIV has remained gener ally stable in recent y ears, at about 50,000 new HIV infections per y ear (CDC, 2014a). While this number is still too high, stabilization is in itself a sign of positiv e progress. With continued increases in the number of people living with HIV due to effectiv e HIV medications, there are potentially more opportunities for HIV tr ansmission than ev er before. Y et, the annual number of new infections has not increased (CDC, 2013). Worldwide, there were about 2.1 million new cases of HIV in 2013, and about 35 million people are living with HIV around the world. Of those, 3.2 million are children, 2.1 million are adolescents, and 4.2 million are people o ver age 50. In 2013 new HIV infections worldwide were 2.1 million, but new infections ha ve fallen 38% since 2001 and new infections among children ha ve fallen b y 58% in the same period (CDC, 2014b; UNAIDS , 2014b). Through 2011 the cumulativ e estimated number of deaths of people with diagnosed HIV infection ev er classified as stage 3 (AIDS) in the United States w as 648,000 (deaths ma y be due to an y cause, which can mak e data interpretation complex). Nearly 39 million people with AIDS ha ve died worldwide since the epidemic began (CDC, 2014b). Globally , AIDS-related deaths, which peak ed in 2005 at 2.4 million and ha ve declined steadily ev er since, were estimated at 1.5 million in 2013 (UNAIDS , 2014a). Ev en though Sub-Sahar an Africa bears the biggest burden of HIV/AIDS , countries in South and Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Centr al Asia, and those in Latin America, are significantly affected b y HIV and AIDS (CDC, 2014b; UNAIDS , 2014b).The disco very of combination antivir al drug ther apies in 1996 resulted in a dr amatic decrease in the number of deaths due to AIDS among people giv en the drug ther apies. On the down side, man y people who ha ve access to the ther apies ma y not benefit from them or ma y not be able to toler ate the side effects. The medications are expensiv e and require strict dosing schedules. Furthermore, in dev eloping countries man y people with HIV have no access to the newer drug ther apies. The W ashington State Department of Health collects surv eillance data and publishes a report twice a y ear. In W ashington State from 2011 to 2015 more than 20,000 people have been diagnosed with HIV and o ver 6,700 ha ve died as a result. The number of new cases in the state has recently seen a small decrease. Between 2011 and 2015 new cases decreased from 570 to 470 persons per y ear. At the end of 2015 more than 12,500 people across the state were living with HIV , and the majorit y (44%) were black males with the highest incidence in King Count y (WDOH, 2016). These reports are a vailable on the Department 's website. HIV and AIDS Cases Are Reportable HIV cases became reportable to the U .S. Department of Health in the fall of 1999. AIDS cases ha ve been reportable (ph ysicians must confidentially report an y cases among their patients) to the CDC since 1984, when the existence of the syndrome that follows HIV infection w as clearly established. AIDS and symptomatic HIV infections ha ve been reportable to the W ashington State Department of Health (WDOH) since 1984 and 1993, respectiv ely. HIV cases became reportable to the W ashington State Department of Health in fall 1999. Part II: Transmission and Infection Control Necessary Conditions for HIV Infection HIV is a relativ ely fragile virus that is not spread b y casual contact. HIV is not easy to \"catch\"\u2014it must be acquired . In order for HIV to be tr ansmitted, three conditions must occur: There must be an HIV source . There must be a sufficient dose of virus . There must be access to the bloodstream of another person.Body Fluids That Can Transmit HIV Anyone infected with the virus is potentially a source of HIV infection. T ransmission occurs primarily through infected blood, semen, v aginal secretions, or breast milk. S weat, tears, saliva, urine, and feces are not capable of tr ansmitting HIV unless visibly contaminated with blood. In settings such as hospital oper ating rooms, other fluids\u2014cerebrospinal fluid, syno vial fluid, pleur al fluid, pericardial fluid, amniotic fluid\u2014ma y be considered infectious if the source is HIV -positiv e. These fluids are gener ally not found outside the hospital setting. Therefore, common body fluids considered potentially infectious for HIV are blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk. Sufficient Dose The concentr ation and amount of HIV necessary for infection to occur is called a sufficient dose . People ma y become infected with HIV if they engage in specific risk beha viors or if they are exposed through needle stick injuries (usually in a healthcare setting). Other blood contact with mucous membr anes or non-intact skin pro vides a possible, but not probable, chance of transmission. Blood Access to another person' s bloodstream in volves beha viors or circumstances that place someone at risk for infectious fluid entering their bloodstream. The most common of the risk beha viors are unprotected sexual intercourse (anal, vaginal, oral) with an infected person, and use of contaminated injection equipment for drugs. HIV tr ansmission ma y occur during pr actices such as tattooing, blood-sharing activities such as \"blood brother \" rituals, or an y other t ype of ritualistic ceremonies where blood is exchanged, or when unsteriliz ed equipment contaminated with blood is shared. HIV transmission ma y also occur in occupational settings. HIV Transmission People ma y become infected with HIV if they engage in specific risk beha viors or if they are exposed through needle stick injuries (usually in a healthcare setting). Other blood contact with mucous membr anes or non-intact skin pro vides a possible, but not probable, chance of transmission. HIV is tr ansmitted through:Unprotected anal, v aginal, and or al intercourse Sharing needles or other injection equipment A mother passing the virus to her bab y either before or during birth An infected woman breastfeeding her infant Accidental needle stick injuries, or infected body fluid coming into contact with the broken skin or mucous membr anes of another person (as with healthcare work ers) A transfusion prior to 1986 of HIV -infected blood or blood products In extremely r are cases, HIV can be tr ansmitted b y sharing r azors or toothbrushes if infected blood from one person w as deposited on the toothbrush or r azor and the blood entered the bloodstream of another person. HIV Transmission Requirements The tr ansmission of HIV depends upon the availability of the infectious agent (HIV) in sufficient quantit y and the viability of the infectious agent (how strong it is). It also depends upon the virulence of the infectious agent (how infectious it is) and the abilit y of the infectious agent to reach the bloodstream, mucous membr anes, or brok en skin of a potential host. One of the predictors of the infectious lev el of an HIV positiv e person is vir al load\u2014how much HIV is present in the bloodstream. Studies show a clear connection between higher viral load in the blood and increased tr ansmissibilit y of HIV . The transmission of HIV depends upon: The availability of the infectious agent (HIV) in sufficient quantit y The viability of the infectious agent (how strong it is) The virulence of the infectious agent (how infectious it is) The ability of the infectious agent to reach the bloodstream, mucous membr anes, or broken skin of a potential host (the entry for getting into another person' s body) One of the predictors of the infectious lev el of an HIV -positiv e person is vir al load, which is how much HIV is present in the bloodstream. Studies show a clear connection between higher vir al load in the blood and increased tr ansmissibilit y of HIV . Blood TransfusionsTransmission b y contaminated blood or blood products occurred in the United States before March 1985. T esting for HIV at blood banks and organ tr ansplant centers began in 1985 and has almost completely eliminated the risks for tr ansmission in dev eloped countries. In 1999 about 1% of national AIDS cases were caused b y transfusions or use of contaminated blood products. The majorit y of those cases were in people who receiv ed blood or blood products before 1985. Probability of HIV Transmission from One HIV Exposure Donor screening, blood testing and other processing measures ha ve reduced the risk of transfusion-caused HIV tr ansmission in the United States to between 1 in 450,000 and 1 in 600,000 tr ansfusions. Donating blood is alw ays safe in the United States, because sterile needles and equipment are used. All used syringes, needles, and blood or body fluid spills should be considered potentially infectious, and should be treated using Standard Precautions (formerly known as Univ ersal Precautions). *A 1% risk means 1 chance in 100 for infection to occur. An 0.10% risk means 1 chance in 1,000. Source: CD C.Probability of Infection Following One Exposure to HIV* Source of infection HIV infection rate (%) Contaminated blood transfusion (prior to 1986) 95.0 One intravenous syringe or needle exposure 0.67 One percutaneous exposure (e.g . a needlestick) 0.4 One episode of receptive anal sexual intercourse 0.1-3 One episode of receptive vaginal intercourse 0.1-0.2 One episode of insertive vaginal intercourse 0.03-0.09 Sexu al Intercourse HIV can enter the bloodstream through mucous membr anes\u2014breaks, sores, and cuts in the mouth, anus, v agina, or penis. Anal, v aginal and or al intercourse (both receptiv e and penetr ative) can tr ansmit HIV from person to person. Anal IntercourseUnprotected anal intercourse is considered to be the greatest sexual risk for tr ansmitting HIV. Anal intercourse frequently results in tears of mucous membr anes, which mak es it very easy for the virus to enter the bloodstream. The receptiv e (bottom) partner is considered to be at more risk of getting HIV if the virus is present. Risks v ary for the insertiv e (top) partner . Vaginal Intercourse Unprotected v aginal intercourse with the ex change of semen, pre-ejaculate fluid, menstrual blood, or v aginal fluid is also a risk for HIV tr ansmission. Studies ha ve shown that women are more lik ely to become infected with HIV through v aginal sex than men. The larger amount of mucous membr ane surface area of the v agina is a probable reason for women' s greater r ate of HIV infection from their male partners. Sharing Needles a nd Drug Injection Equipment Sharing injection needles, syringes, and other drug par aphernalia with an HIV -infected person can put HIV directly into the user 's bloodstream and is the beha vior that most efficiently tr ansmits HIV , hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV). Indirect sharing occurs when drug injectors share injection par aphernalia or divide a shared or jointly purchased drug while preparing and injecting it. The par aphernalia that carry the potential for tr ansmission are the syringe, needle, \"cook er,\" cotton, and rinse water. Sharing these items (sometimes called \"works\") ma y transmit HIV \u2014or other bacteria and viruses. Examples of indirect sharing are when a user squirts the drug back (from a dirt y syringe) into the drug cook er or someone else' s syringe or shares a common filter or rinse w ater. HIV and Pregnancy An HIV -infected woman ma y transmit the virus to her bab y during pregnancy , during the birth process, or following pregnancy b y breastfeeding. One of the predictors of how infectious the woman will be to her bab y is her vir al load (how much HIV is present in her bloodstream). W omen with new or recent infections or people in later stages of AIDS tend to have higher vir al loads and ma y be more infectious. In 1994 researchers disco vered that a course of the antiretro viral drug AZT (zido vudine) significantly reduced the tr ansmission of HIV from woman to bab y. In 2002 medications such as AZT and others were introduced during pregnancy and deliv ery to prev ent transmission of HIV .HIV is tr ansmitted from an HIV -infected woman to her bab y in about 25% of pregnancies if interv ention with antiretro viral medications does not occur . The perinatal tr ansmission r ate has dropped dr amatically in the United States due to the widespread use of AZT b y HIV - infected pregnant women. When a woman' s health is monitored closely and she receiv es a combination of antiretro viral ther apies during pregnancy , the risk of HIV tr ansmission to the newborn drops below 2%. In some pregnancies, cesarean section (C -section) ma y be recommended to reduce the risk of tr ansmission from woman to bab y. Advice about medications and C -section should be giv en on an individual basis b y a medical pro vider with experience in treating HIV - positiv e pregnant women. W ashington State la w requires pregnant women to be counseled regarding risks of HIV and offered v oluntary HIV testing.

Unprotected v aginal intercourse. B. Breastfeeding.C. Direct sharing of drug par aphernalia. D.HIV infection is lifelong\u2014once people become infected with HIV , their blood, semen, v aginal secretions, and breast milk will alw ays be potentially infectious. Transmission of Multidrug-Resist ant Forms of HIV There is evidence of tr ansmission of multidrug-resistant forms of HIV . People who ha ve been infected with HIV and ha ve used a number of the a vailable antiretro viral medicines may transmit forms of HIV that are resistant to some of these a vailable drug ther apies. This reduces the treatments a vailable for the newly HIV -infected person. Risk Factors Affecting HIV Transmission The Presen ce of Other STDs The presence of other sexually tr ansmitted diseases (STDs) increases the risk for HIV transmission, because the infected person ma y have a much larger number of HIV -infected white blood cells present at the site of infection. The infected person' s immune system ma y be less able to suppress or combat HIV infection. Lesions from STDs break down the protectiv e surface of the skin or mucous membr ane, which mak es the infected person more vulner able to other infections. The presence of infection with other STDs increases the risk of HIV tr ansmission because: STDs lik e syphilis and symptomatic herpes can cause breaks in the skin, which provide direct entry for HIV . Inflammation from STDs, such as chlam ydia, mak es it easier for HIV to enter and infect the body . HIV is often detected in the pus or other discharge from genital ulcers of HIV -infected men and women. Sores can bleed easily and come into contact with v aginal, cervical, or al, urethr al, and rectal tissues during sex. Inflammation appears to increase HIV vir al shedding and the vir al load in genital secretions. Multiple Partners Having multiple partners for drug injection or sexual intercourse increases the chances of being exposed to a person infected with HIV . People who ha ve unprotected sex with multiple partners are considered to be at high risk for HIV infection. In some studies, the CDC defines multiple partners as six or more partners in a y ear. Howev er, someone who has only one partner is still at risk if the person is HIV -positiv e and they ha ve unprotected sex and/or share needles.Use of Non-Injecting Drugs Use of other substances, including alcohol and non-injecting street drugs, can also put a person at risk for getting HIV . These substances impair judgment, increasing the lik elihood that a person will tak e risks (ha ve unprotected sex, share needles), or ma y place the person in unsafe situations. Additionally , some substances ha ve physiological and biologic effects on the body , including masking pain and producing sores on the mouth and genitals, which can create additional \"openings\" for HIV and other sexually tr ansmitted diseases. Gender and Equality Issues Lack of power (being subservient) in a relationship can affect a person' s abilit y to insist on sexual protection, such as the use of condoms. W omen are socially and economically dependent upon men in man y societies. This sometimes results in their being unable to ask their partner to use condoms or to lea ve a relationship that puts them at risk. In some cultures, females are not encour aged to learn about their bodies, sex, birth control, or other sexualit y topics. Other cultures promote the v alue of the male ha ving multiple sexual partners, while discour aging the same beha vior in females. Casual Contact HIV is not tr ansmitted through the air or b y sneezing, breathing, or coughing. T ouching, hugging, and shaking hands do not tr ansmit HIV . HIV tr ansmission is not possible through restaur ant food prepared or serv ed by an HIV -infected emplo yee. HIV is not tr ansmitted through casual contact in the workplace. No cases of HIV transmission ha ve been link ed to sharing computers, food, telephones, paper , water fountains, swimming pools, bathrooms, desks, office furniture, toilet seats, showers, tools, equipment, coffee pots, or eating facilities. Howev er, personal items that ma y be contaminated with blood, including but not limited to r azors, toothbrushes, and sex to ys, should not be shared. There ha ve been no cases of HIV tr ansmission b y children pla ying, eating, sleeping, kissing, and hugging. Unusual Cases o f HIV TransmissionTo date, less than a doz en known cases of HIV tr ansmission ha ve occurred in household settings in the United States and elsewhere. R eports of these cases ha ve been thoroughly investigated b y the CDC. The researchers determined that the tr ansmissions were caused by sharing a r azor contaminated with infected blood, exposure of infected blood to cuts and brok en skin, and (possibly) deep kissing in volving a couple who both had bleeding gums and poor dental h ygiene. It is important to remember that these cases were extremely unusual. Sensible precautions with bleeding cuts and not sharing personal hygiene items would ha ve prev ented these cases of infection. There are also isolated cases of tr ansmission from healthcare work ers to patients. T o date, there were three instances where tr ansmission of HIV could only be tr acked to the HIV - infected clinician treating the patient. A t least one of these cases occurred prior to the implementation of strict equipment disinfection. Biting Biting poses v ery little risk of HIV tr ansmission. The possibilit y only exists if the person who is biting and the person who is bitten ha ve an ex change of blood (such as through bleeding gums or open sores in the mouth). Bites ma y transmit other infections, and should be treated immediately b y thoroughly w ashing the bitten skin with soap and w arm water and then disinfecting with antibiotic skin ointment. Workplace Sit uations Workplace exposures gener ally occur through a needle stick injury but can occur through a splash of infectious blood or exposure to blood-contaminated material.

What would y ou teach him? A: Your risk of exposure to HIV increases b y risky beha viors such as ha ving multiple sexual partners, unprotected anal and v aginal intercourse and exposure to an y used and infected IV needles and drug par aphernalia. Risk Reduction Methods There are man y effectiv e methods for reducing the risk of sexual and drug-related transmission of HIV . Sexu al Abstinence Sexual abstinence (not engaging in anal, v aginal, or or al intercourse or other sexual activities where blood, semen, or v aginal fluid can enter the body) is a completely safe and 100% effectiv e method for prev enting the of HIV . Non-Penetrative Sex Non-penetr ative sex, where the penis does not enter the v agina or anus, and penetr ative sex to ys are not shared, is a safer sex method that greatly decreases y our risk of getting infected with HIV . This pr actice will not tr ansmit HIV , provided that there is no ex change of blood, semen, v aginal fluids, or breast milk in the sexual contact. Non-penetr ative sexual intercourse, howev er, may still be a risk factor for the tr ansmission of other sexually transmitted diseases. Monogamous Long-Term RelationshipsUnprotected v aginal intercourse. A. Breastfeeding.B. Unprotected Direct sharing of drug par aphernalia. D.Monogam y\u2014having sex with only one person who only has sex with y ou\u2014is another choice to prev ent/reduce the risk of HIV infection. If neither partner is infected with HIV or other STDs, and neither has other sexual or injection equipment \u2014sharing contacts, then neither partner is at risk of exposure to HIV or other STDs. In order for monogam y to protect against HIV and STDs, both partners must be free of disease and both partners must remain monogamous. Limiting Partners The decision to limit the number of sexual or drug-injecting partners ma y reduce the risk of HIV tr ansmission, but is not a guar antee of safet y. The fewer the partners the greater the reduction of risk. Safer Sexua l Practices Did you know . . . Not all condoms and lubricants pro vide effectiv e protection against the transmission of HIV and other STDs. Latex condoms Latex condoms, when used correctly and consistently during sexual intercourse, (anal, vaginal, and or al) are highly effectiv e in prev enting the tr ansmission of HIV . To prev ent tearing of latex condoms, only w ater-based lubricants should be used. Oil-based lubricants like petroleum jelly or cooking oils should not be used because the oil in these products breaks down the latex condom. Polyurethane Condoms For the male, polyurethane condoms are made of a soft plastic. They look lik e latex condoms but are thinner . Lab tests show that sperm and viruses (lik e HIV) cannot pass through polyurethane. Female condoms are insertiv e (fit inside the v agina or anus). They are made of polyurethane, which blocks sperm and viruses (lik e HIV). These condoms ma y be inserted several hours before intercourse. If howev er, there is still blood/semen contact with a cut on the outside of the v agina, this ma y still serv e as a point of entry for the HIV ev en if the female condom is used. Dental DamsDental dams\u2014large pieces of new , unused, clear , non-microw aveable plastic wr ap\u2014and latex condoms ma y be used to pro vide a barrier to reduce the risk of HIV tr ansmission during or al intercourse. The latex condom can be cut into a square for use as a dental dam. W ater-based lubricants ma y be used with the dental dams, plastic wr ap, or cut -open condoms to enhance sensitivit y and reduce friction. Natural Membrane Condoms Did you know . . . Natur al membr ane condoms (skins) do not pro vide protection from HIV, HBV , and some other STDs. (They can, howev er, help prev ent pregnancies and some STDs, such as syphilis.) When Both Partners Are HIV Positive If two people are infected with HIV , do they still need to ha ve protected sex? Some people think it is safe for HIV -infected people to ha ve unprotected sex with each other , but latex condoms are advised when both partners are HIV -positiv e. Each additional exposure to the virus ma y further weak en an immune system already damaged b y HIV . Other STDs are transmitted through unprotected sex. An y additional vir al or bacterial infection stresses the immune system and should be a voided. Avoidance of Injection Drug Use Not injecting drugs is another w ay to a void tr ansmission of HIV . If abstaining from using injecting drugs is not possible or if the infected person refuses to abstain from injecting drugs, then use a clean needle each time and do not share injection equipment. This includes people who use needles to inject insulin, vitamins, steroids, or prescription or non- prescription drugs. Syringe Exchange Syringe ex change, or needle ex change, is a disease prev ention progr am for people who use illegal drugs. It pro vides new sterile syringes in ex change for used ones. P eople who trade in their used syringes/needles for clean ones at needle ex changes significantly reduce their risk for sharing needles and becoming infected with HIV or hepatitis. Syringe ex changes are also referr al sources for drug treatment. P articipants ma y be able to secure drug treatment through the interv ention of the syringe ex change staff . Public support for syringe ex change has grown in recent y ears. Man y local health departments in Washington State, some in conjunction with other organizations, oper ate syringe exchanges in their communities. F or more information, contact y our local/district HIV/AIDS progr am.It is safest alw ays to use new , sterile needles and syringes, as well as other \"works\" (which can all become contaminated with blood). If someone cannot a void sharing syringes, rinsing out the syringe/needle with full-strength bleach and clean w ater helps clean the syringe/needle and kill an y HIV inside it. There is high prev alence of HBV and HCV infection among injecting drug users; these viruses are stronger than HIV and are not lik ely to be killed b y short contact with bleach. Cleaning the syringe with bleach and w ater is not lik ely to prev ent tr ansmission of HBV or HCV. There is no substitute for a new syringe. If there is no possible w ay to obtain new needles, the directions for using bleach to clean syringes/needles follows: It is important to follow these steps exactly , because inadequate cleaning can result in the possibilit y of HIV infection. Alw ays do the final rinse with w ater! Occupational Exposure Occupational exposure means reasonably anticipated skin, ey e, mucous membr ane, or parenter al contact with blood or OPIM that ma y result from the performance of an emplo yee's duties. Exposure incident means a specific ey e, mouth, other mucous membr ane, non-intact skin, or parenter al contact with blood or OPIM that results from the performance of an emplo yee's duties. Examples of non-intact skin at risk include skin with dermatitis, hangnails, cuts, abr asions, chafing, or acne. Occupational groups that ha ve been widely recogniz ed as ha ving potential exposure to HBV/HCV/HIV include, but are not limited to , healthcare emplo yees, la w enforcement, fire, ambulance, and other emergency response, and public service emplo yees.Fill the syringe completely with w ater. 1. Tap it with y our finger to loosen an y traces of blood. 2. Shake the syringe and shoot out the bloody w ater. 3. Repeat these steps until y ou can' t see an y blood. Then: 4. Fill the syringe completely with fresh bleach.5. Keep the bleach inside the syringe for at least 30 seconds. 6. Shoot out the used bleach.7. Rinse out the syringe with new , clean w ater. 8. Shake the syringe and squirt out the w ater. 9.The following requirements are mandated b y Washington Administr ative Code (W AC) Chapter 296-823, Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne P athogens. They are enforced b y the Department of Labor and Industries Division of Occupational Safet y and Health (DOSH). Please check with y our agencies to mak e sure y ou are in compliance with the requirements of this rule. F ailure to comply ma y result in citations or penalties. The compliance directiv e of the feder al Occupational Safet y and Health Administr ation (OSHA) on occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens, CPL 2-2.69, ma y be consulted for additional direction.

The following standards and rules are specifically for the state of W ashington, howev er man y states ha ve similar standards and compliance with the occupational exposures rules outlined here are effectiv e in minimizing risk of bloodborne vides requirements to protect emplo yees from exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM) that ma y contain bloodborne pathogens. This section applies to emplo yers who have emplo yees with occupational exposure to blood or OPIM, ev en if no actual exposure incidents ha ve occurred. Answer: DTest Your Learning Occupational exposure means: Apply Your Knowledge Q: Healthcare professionals need to receiv e bloodborne pathogens tr aining. What would it include? A: Training includes protectiv e measures to minimiz e the risk and what to do if exposure occurs. Bloodborne Pathogens While HBV and HIV are specifically identified in the standard, bloodborne pathogens include any human pathogen present in human blood or OPIM . Bloodborne pathogens ma y V-II, and vir al hemorrhagic fev er. According to the CDC, hepatitis C (HCV) infection is the most common chronic bloodborne infection in the United States. Hepatitis C is a vir al infection of the liv er transmitted primarily b y exposure to blood. Blood and Other Potentially Infectious Materials (OPIM) Bodily fluids that ha ve been recogniz ed as link ed to the tr ansmission of HIV , HBV and HCV , and to which Standard Precautions apply , are: Blood Blood products SemenExposure to food serv ed by an HIV -infected emplo yee. A. Being infected b y an occupational work er. B. Caring for a patient who has HIV . C. Reasonably anticipated skin, ey e, mucous membr ane, or parenter al contact with blood or OPIM that ma y result from the performance of an emplo yee's duties.D.Vaginal secretions Cerebrospinal fluid Synovial (joint) fluid fluid Peritoneal (gut) fluid Pericardial (heart) fluid Amniotic (fluid surrounding the fetus) fluid Saliva in dental procedures Specimens with concentr ated HIV , HBV and HCV viruses Body fluids such as urine, feces, and v omitus are not considered OPIM unless visibly contaminated b y blood. W astew ater (sew age) has not been implicated in the tr ansmission of HIV , HBV , and HCV and is not considered to be either OPIM or regulated w aste. Howev er, plumbers working in healthcare facilities or who are exposed to sew age originating directly from healthcare facilities carry a theoretical risk of occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Emplo yers should consider this risk when preparing their written \"exposure determination. \" Plumbers or w astew ater work ers working elsewhere are probably not at risk for exposure to bloodborne pathogens. W astew ater contains man y other health hazards and work ers should use appropriate personal protectiv e equipment (PPE) and maintain personal h ygiene standards when working. Exposure Control Plan (ECP) Each emplo yer covered under W AC 296-823 must dev elop an Exposure Control Plan (ECP). The ECP shall contain at least the following elements: A written \"exposure determination\" that includes those job classifications and positions in which emplo yees ha ve the potential for occupational exposures. The exposure determination shall ha ve been made without taking into consider ation the use of personal protectiv e clothing or equipment. It is important to include those emplo yees who are required or expected to administer first aid. The procedure for ev aluating the circumstances surrounding exposure incidents, including maintenance of a \"sharps injury log. \" The infection control system used in y our workplace. Documentation of consider ation and implementation of appropriate, commercially available safer medical devices designed to eliminate or minimiz e occupationalexposure. The ECP must be updated at least annually and whenev er changes occur that effect occupational exposure. Bloodborne Pathogens Training Training will include information on the hazards associated with blood/OPIM, the protectiv e measures to be tak en to minimiz e the risk of occupational exposure, and information on the appropriate actions to tak e if an exposure occurs. Retraining is required annually , or when changes in procedures or tasks affecting occupational exposure occur . Emplo yees must be pro vided access to a qualified tr ainer during the tr aining session to ask and ha ve answered questions as questions arise. All new emplo yees or emplo yees being tr ansferred into jobs in volving tasks or activities with potential exposure to blood/OPIM shall receiv e training in accordance with W AC 296-823-120 prior to assignment to tasks where occupational exposure ma y occur. Hepatitis B Va ccination All emplo yees with occupational exposure to blood or OPIM must be offered hepatitis B vaccination after receiving required tr aining and within 10 da ys of initial assignment. The vaccine must be pro vided free of charge. Serologic testing after v accination (to ensure that the shots were effectiv e) is recommended for all people with ongoing exposure to sharp medical devices. The pro vision of emplo yer-supplied hepatitis B v accination ma y be dela yed until after probable exposure for emplo yees whose sole exposure risk is the pro vision of first aid (see W AC 296-823-130). Infection Control Systems Universal Precautions w as a system designed to prev ent tr ansmission of bloodborne pathogens in healthcare and other settings. Under Univ ersal Precautions, blood/OPIM of all patients should alw ays be considered potentially infectious for HIV and other pathogens. Standard Precautions is the preferred, newer system because it considers all body fluids except sweat to be potentially infectious.Standard Precautions (and Univ ersal Precautions) in volve the use of protectiv e barriers\u2014 defined in the following section\u2014to reduce the risk of exposure of the emplo yee's skin or mucous membr anes to OPIM. It is also recommended that all healthcare work ers tak e precautions to prev ent injuries caused b y needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments or devices. Both Standard and Univ ersal Precautions apply to blood and OPIM. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Gloves, masks, protectiv e eyewear and chin-length plastic face shields are examples of personal protectiv e equipment (PPE). PPE shall be pro vided and worn b y emplo yees in all instances where they will or ma y come into contact with blood or OPIM. This includes but is not limited to dentistry , phlebotom y, or processing of an y bodily fluid specimen, and postmortem (after death) procedures. Traditionally , latex glo ves ha ve been advised for use when dealing with blood or OPIM. Howev er, some people are allergic to latex. In most circumstances, nitrile, vin yl, and other glove alternativ es meet the definition of \"appropriate\" glo ves and ma y be used in place of latex glo ves. Emplo yers are required to pro vide non-latex alternativ es to emplo yees with latex and other sensitivities. R eusable PPE must be cleaned and decontaminated, or laundered, b y the emplo yer. Lab coats and scrubs are gener ally considered to be worn as uniforms or personal clothing. When contamination is reasonably lik ely, protectiv e gowns should be worn. If lab coats or scrubs are worn as PPE, they must be remo ved as soon as pr actical and laundered b y the emplo yer. All new emplo yees or emplo yees being tr ansferred into jobs in volving tasks or activities with potential exposure to blood/OPIM shall receiv e training in accordance with W AC 296-823-120 prior to assignment to tasks where occupational exposure ma y occur. The pro vision of emplo yer-supplied hepatitis B v accination ma y be dela yed until after probable exposure for emplo yees whose sole exposure risk is the pro vision of first aid (see W AC 296-823-130). Safer Medical Dev ices Safer medical devices and work pr actices are prefer able to personal protectiv e equipment to minimiz e or eliminate emplo yee exposure. There are now man y safer medical devices available.Emplo yers must include emplo yees in ongoing ev aluation of safer medical devices and implement these devices whenev er feasible. Ev aluation and implementation of these devices must be documented in the ECP . Safer medical device lists can be accessed through websites maintained b y the California Division of Occupational Safet y and Health SHARP progr am, the National Association for the Primary Prev ention of Sharps Injuries, and the International Health Care W orker Safet y Center . Hand Hygiene Hand h ygiene (soap- and-water w ashing or use of a w aterless alcohol-based hand rub) must be performed: After remo val of glo ves or other protectiv e equipment. Immediately after hand contact with blood or other infectious materials. Upon lea ving the work area. It is also recommended that hand h ygiene be performed before and after patient contact and after using restroom facilities. Soap- and-water hand w ashing must be performed whenev er hands are visibly contaminated or there is a reasonable lik elihood of contamination. Proper soap- and-water hand w ashing technique in volves the following: Using soap , warm (almost hot) w ater, and good friction, scrub the top , back, and all sides of the fingers. Lather well and rinse for at least 10 seconds. When rinsing, begin at the fingertips, so that the dirt y water runs down and off the hands from the wrists. It is prefer able to use a pump-t ype of liquid soap instead of bar hand soap . Dry hands on paper towels. Use the dry paper towels to turn off the faucets (don' t touch with clean hands). It is advisable to k eep fingernails short, and to wear a minimum of jewelry . Additional information on hand h ygiene can be found on the CDC Hand Hy giene.

Housekeeping The work area is to be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition. The emplo yer is required to determine and implement a written schedule for cleaning and disinfection based on the location within the facilit y, type of surface to be cleaned, t ype of soil present, and tasks or procedures being performed. All equipment and en vironmental and working surfaces must be properly cleaned and disinfected after contact with blood or OPIM. Contaminated brok en glassw are must be remo ved using mechanical means, lik e a brush and dustpan or v acuum cleaner . Disin fectants Chemical germicides and disinfectants used at recommended dilutions must be used to decontaminate en vironmental surfaces.

D.Specim en Handling Specimens of blood or OPIM must be placed in a closeable, labeled or color -coded, leak - proof container prior to being stored or tr ansported. Laundry Laundry that is or ma y be soiled with blood or OPIM, or ma y contain contaminated sharps, must be treated as though contaminated. Contaminated laundry must be bagged at the location where it w as used, and shall not be sorted or rinsed in patient -care areas. It must be placed and tr ansported in bags that are labeled or color -coded (red-bagged). Laundry work ers must wear protectiv e gloves and other appropriate personal protectiv e clothing when handling potentially contaminated laundry . All contaminated laundry must be cleaned or laundered so that an y infectious agents are destro yed. Guidance regarding laundry handling and w ashing procedures in the health care setting can be found in the CDC Guidelines for En vironmental Infection Control in the Healthcare Facilities, 2008. Regulated Waste Disp osal WAC 296-823 defines \"regulated w aste\" as an y of the following: Liquid or semi-liquid blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM) Contaminated items that would release blood or OPIM in a liquid or semi-liquid state, if compressed Items that are cak ed with dried blood or OPIM and are capable of releasing these materials during handling Contaminated sharps Pathological and microbiological w astes containing blood 7 0.95K addresses \"biomedical waste management.\" Individual count y or health jurisdiction w aste management regulations ma y need to be consulted.

How would y ou explain the process? A: Regulated w aste is suspicious of body fluids and ma y not be flushed down toilets and must be placed in closeable, leakproof containers or bags and color -coded or labeled. It does also include items on which blood has dried. Sharps Disp osal Needles are not to be recapped , purposely bent or brok en, remo ved, or otherwise manipulated b y hand. After they are used, disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp items are to be immediately placed in puncture-resistant, labeled containers for disposal. Phlebotom y needles must not be remo ved from holders unless required b y a medical procedure. The intact phlebotom y needle/holder must be placed directly into an appropriate sharps container . Tags/Labels Tags or labels must be used to protect emplo yees from exposure to potentially hazardous biological agents in accordance to the requirements contained in W ACs 296-823-14025, 296-823-14050, and 296-800-11045. All required tags must ha ve the following: Tags must contain a signal word or symbol and a major message. The signal word shall be BIOHAZARD , or the biological hazard symbol. The major message must indicate the specific hazardous condition or the instruction to be communicated to the emplo yee. The signal word must be readable at a minimum of fiv e feet or such greater distance as warranted b y the hazard. The tag' s major message must be presented in either pictogr aphs, written text, or both. The signal word and the major message must be understandable to all emplo yees who ma y be exposed to the identified hazard.All emplo yees will be informed as to the meaning of the v arious tags used throughout the workplace and what special precautions are necessary . In accordance to the requirements contained in W ACs 296-823-14025, 296-823- 14050, and 296-800-11045, all tags and labels must meet the abo ve listed requirements. Personal Activities Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm, and handling contact lenses are prohibited in work areas that carry occupational exposure. F ood and drink must not be stored in refriger ators, freez ers, or cabinets where blood or OPIM are stored, or in other areas. Post Exposure Management Emplo yers must mak e a confidential post exposure medical ev aluation a vailable to emplo yees who report an exposure incident. The post exposure medical ev aluation must be: Made immediately a vailable Kept confidential Provided at no cost to the emplo yee Provided according to current U .S. Public Health Service recommendations The emplo yer is also responsible for arr anging individual testing in accordance with WAC 296-823-160. Additional requirements for HIV/HBV research labor atories and production facilities can be found in W AC 296-823-180. Occupational Exposure to HIV/HBV/HCV and Other Bloodborne Pathogens An occupational exposure to a bloodborne pathogen is defined as a percutaneous injury such as a needle stick or cut with a sharp object, or contact of mucous membr ane or non- intact skin (eg, exposed skin that is chapped, abr aded, or afflicted with dermatitis) with blood, tissue, or OPIM. The CDC states that the risk of infection v aries case b y case. F actors influencing the risk of infection include: Whether the exposure w as from a hollow -bore needle or other sharp instrument Non-intact skin or mucus membr anes (such as the ey es, nose, and/or mouth)The amount of blood that was involved The amount of virus present in the source's blood Answer: ATest Your Learning An example of an occupational exposure to a bloodborne pathogen is: Risk of HIV Transmission The risk of HIV infection to a healthcare worker through a needle stick is less than 1%. Approximately 1 in 300 exposures through a needle or sharp instrument result in infection. The risks of HIV infection through splashes of blood to the eyes, nose, or mouth is even smaller\u2014approximately 1 in 1,000. There have been no reports of HIV transmission from blood contact with intact skin. There is a theoretical risk of blood contact to an area of skin that is damaged, or from a large area of skin covered in blood for a long period of time. The CDC reports that \"as of 2010, 57 documented transmissions and 143 possible transmissions had been reported in the United States,\" and \"no confirmed cases of occupational HIV transmission have been reported since 1999\" (CDC, 2016). Answer: BTest Your Learning HIV transmission risk to healthcare workers is: Risk of Hepatitis B and C TransmissionA needle stick from a patient who does not have HIV.A. Taking the temperature of an HIV-infected patient using Standard Precautions.B. Carrying a red-bagged urine specimen to the lab.C. Assisting an HIV-infected patient to walk in the hallway using Standard Precautions.D. Highest with a blood splash to the eyes, nose, or mouth.A. Less than 1% from a needle stick.B. Exactly the same as that of HCV.C. Less than 10% from a needle stick.D.The risk of getting HBV from a needle stick is 22% to 31% if the source person tests positiv e for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). If the source person is HBsAg-positiv e and HBeAg-negativ e, there is a 1% to 6% risk of getting HBV unless the person exposed has been v accinated. The risk of getting HCV from a needle stick is 1.8%. The risk of getting HBV or HCV from a blood splash to the ey es, nose, or mouth is possible but believ ed to be v ery small. As of 1999, about 800 healthcare work ers a y ear are reported to be infected with HBV following occupational exposure. There are no exact estimates on how man y healthcare work ers contract HCV from an occupational exposure, but the risk is considered low . Treatment After a Potential Exposure Follow the protocol of y our emplo yer. As soon as safely possible, w ash the affected area(s) with soap and w ater. Application of antiseptics should not be a substitute for w ashing. It is recommended that an y potentially contaminated clothing be remo ved as soon as possible. It is also recommended that y ou familiariz e yourself with existing protocols and the location of emergency ey ewash or showers and other stations within y our facilit y. Mucous Membrane Exposure If there is exposure to the ey es, nose, or mouth, flush thoroughly with w ater, saline, or sterile irrigants. The risk of contr acting HIV through this t ype of exposure is estimated to be 0.09%. Sharps Injuries Wash the exposed area with soap and w ater. Do not \"milk\" or squeez e the wound. There is no evidence that shows using antiseptics (lik e hydrogen pero xide) will reduce the risk of transmission for an y bloodborne pathogens; howev er, the use of antiseptics is not contraindicated. In the ev ent that the wound needs suturing, emergency treatment should be obtained. The risk of contr acting HIV from this t ype of exposure is estimated to be 0.3%. Bite or Scratch Wounds Exposure to saliv a is not considered substantial unless there is visible contamination with blood or the saliv a emanates from a dental procedure. W ash the area with soap and w ater, and co ver with a sterile dressing as appropriate. All bites should be ev aluated b y a healthcare professional. Did you know . . .For human bites, the clinical ev aluation must include the possibilit y that both the person bitten and the person who inflicted the bite were exposed to bloodborne pathogens. Exposure to Urine, Vomitus, or Feces Exposure to urine, feces, v omitus, or sputum is not considered a potential bloodborne pathogens exposure unless the fluid is visibly contaminated with blood. F ollow y our emplo yer's procedures for cleaning these fluids. Reporting the Exposure Follow the protocol of y our emplo yer. After cleaning the exposed area as recommended above, report the exposure to the department or to the individual at y our workplace who is responsible for managing exposure. Obtain medical ev aluation as soon as possible. Discuss with a healthcare professional the extent of the exposure, treatment, followup care, personal prev ention measures, the need for a tetanus shot, or other care. Your emplo yer is required to pro vide an appropriate post exposure management referr al at no cost to y ou. In addition, y our emplo yer must pro vide the following information to the evaluating healthcare professional: A description of the job duties the exposed emplo yee was performing when exposed Documentation of the routes of exposure and circumstances under which exposure occurred Results of the source person' s blood testing, if a vailable All medical records that y ou are responsible to maintain, including v accination status, relevant to the appropriate treatment of the emplo yee. Remember that HIV and hepatitis infection are notifiable conditions under W AC 246- 101. A cop y of W AC 296-823-160 must be giv en to the emplo yee. Post Exposure ProphylaxisPost exposure prophylaxis (PEP) provides anti-HIV medications to someone who has had a substantial exposure, usually to blood. PEP has been the standard of care for occupationally exposed healthcare work ers with substantial exposures since 1996. Animal models suggest that cellular HIV infection happens within 2 da ys of exposure to HIV and the virus in blood is detectable within 5 da ys. Therefore, PEP should be started as soon as possible, within hours not da ys, after exposure and continued for 28 da ys. Howev er, PEP for HIV does not pro vide prev ention of other bloodborne diseases lik e HBV or HCV . Hepatitis B PEP for susceptible people would include administr ation of hepatitis B immune globulin and HBV v accine. This should occur as soon as possible and no later than 7 da ys post exposure. The benefit of the use of antivir al agents to prev ent HCV infection is unknown, and antivir als are not currently FDA -appro ved for proph ylaxis. Because of the frequent advances in treatment, doses and medications are not listed here. P ost exposure proph ylaxis can only be obtained from a licensed healthcare pro vider. Your facilit y may have recommendations and a chain of command in place for y ou to obtain PEP . PEP is not as simple as sw allowing one pill. The medications must be started as soon as possible, and continued for 28 da ys. Man y people experience significant medication side effects. It is v ery important to report occupational exposure to the department at y our workplace that is responsible for managing exposure. If post exposure treatment is recommended, it should be started as soon as possible. In rur al areas, police, firefighters, and other at -risk emergency pro viders should identif y a 24-hour source for PEP (thebody .com, 2017). In addition, in man y states, health care and civil work ers ha ve a right to file a work ers' compensation claim for exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Industrial insur ance co vers the cost of post exposure proph ylaxis and follow -up for the injured work er. Answer: DApply Your Knowledge Q: A fellow healthcare work er has just had a needle stick and the source w as HIV positiv e. She panics and asks y ou what to do . What resources exist to help her? A: After immediately cleaning the affected area with soap and w ater and a disinfectant, direct her to her supervisor and her facilit y director o ver occupational health so she can get PEP . She needs to mak e a work ers' compensation claim for the PEP , which she will need to tak e for at least 28 da ys. Tell her the National Hotline for PEP is also a resource. PEP should begin immediately , prefer ably within hours of exposure. Healthcare professionals and pro viders can call 888 448 4911 for the latest information on PEP for HIV , hepatitis, and other pathogens. Washington State work ers ha ve a right to file a work ers' compensation claim for exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Industrial insur ance co vers the cost of post exposure proph ylaxis and follow -up for the injured work er. HIV/HBV/ HCV Testing Post Exposure All occupational exposures should be ev aluated b y a healthcare professional. Ev aluation should include followup counseling, post exposure testing, and medical ev aluation, regardless of whether PEP is indicated. Antibody testing for HIV , HBV , and HCV should be conducted for 6 months after occupational exposure. After baseline testing at the time of exposure, followup testing is recommended to be performed at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after exposure. Extended HIV followup (eg, for 12 months) is recommended for those who become infected with HCV after exposure to a source co-infected with HIV . Extended followup in other circumstances (eg, for those people with an impaired abilit y to mount an antibody response to infection) ma y also be considered. Source Testing Many states require the emplo yer to arr ange to test the source individual\u2014someone whose blood or OPIM an emplo yee was exposed to\u2014for HIV , HBV , and HCV as soon as feasible after getting their consent. If the emplo yer does not get consent the emplo yer must document such and inform the emplo yee. Mandatory Source TestingIf you experience an occupational substantial exposure to another person' s blood or OPIM, you can request HIV testing of the source individual through y our emplo yer or local health officer . Before health officers issue an order for HIV testing of the source individual, they will first determine whether a substantial exposure occurred and if the exposure occurred on the job. Depending on the t ype of exposure and risks in volved, the health officer ma y mak e the determination that source testing is unnecessary . In the case of occupationally exposed healthcare work ers, if the emplo yer is unable to obtain permission of the source individual, the emplo yer ma y request assistance from the local health officer pro vided the request is made within 7 da ys of the occurrence. Source testing does not eliminate the need for baseline testing of the exposed individual for HIV , HBV , HCV , and liv er enzymes. Pro vision of PEP should also not be contingent upon the results of a source' s test. Current wisdom indicates immediate pro vision of PEP in certain circumstances, with discontinuation of treatment based upon the source' s test results.

Online Resources Video (2:43): Exposed to HIV Infection? PEP, Post Exposure Prophylaxis within 72 hours https://www .YouTube.com/w atch?v=ObgC -dhXCLY Because of an increased risk for HIV exposure, the R evised Code of W ashington 70.24.340 pro vides for HIV antibody testing of a \"source\" when a la w enforcement officer , firefighter , healthcare pro vider, or healthcare facilit y staff , and certain other professions experience an occupational exposure. Non-Occupational Exposure to HIVPost exposure proph ylaxis for occupational exposure is standard, and its effectiv eness has been documented. F or sexual exposure (assault or consenting) or for needle-sharing, PEP is not standard medical pr actice in man y communities. Good places to start PEP include your local emergency room. Post exposure proph ylaxis (PEP) should nev er be used for primary prev ention of HIV . Unlike emergency contr aception to prev ent pregnancy , there are no good studies to show that PEP works for post -sexual exposure. It is a complicated combination of medicines that sometimes ha ve serious side effects. Depending on y our location in W ashington State, pro viders ma y not ev en be familiar with the idea of pro viding PEP to people who ha ve post -sexual exposure to HIV . In Seattle and W estern W ashington there are clinics that specifically treat HIV e people. http://www .kingcount y.gov/healthservices/health.aspx and http://www .kingcount y.gov/healthservices/health/communicable/hiv/resources/testing.asp Procedures for Homes and Home-like Settings People who liv e or work in homes and home-lik e settings should pr actice good h ygiene techniques in preparing food, handling body fluids, and medical equipment. Cuts, accidents, or other circumstances can result in spills of blood/OPIM. These spills ma y be deposited upon carpeting, vin yl flooring, clothing, a person' s skin, or other surfaces. It is important that ev eryone, ev en young children, ha ve a basic understanding that they should not put their bare hands in, or on, another person' s blood. Safe pr actices for some commonly encountered situations can help minimiz e the risk of HIV exposure and infection. Gloves Gloves are a vailable in latex, nitrile, or vin yl. Some people ha ve allergies to latex. Gloves should be worn when caretak ers anticipate direct contact with an y body substances (blood or OPIM) or non-intact skin. When y ou are through, carefully pull the glo ves off , inside-out, one at a time, so that the contaminated surfaces are inside and y ou avoid contact with an y potentially infectious material. Gloves should be changed and hands w ashed as soon as possible between children, patients, and others.Never rub the ey es, mouth or face while wearing glo ves. Latex glo ves should nev er be washed and reused. Handwashing Technique Correct handw ashing is extremely important. The steps to follow for good handw ashing technique include: Use soap , warm (almost hot) w ater, and good friction, making sure to scrub the top , back, and all sides of the fingers. Lather well and rinse for at least 10 seconds. When rinsing, begin at the fingertips, so that the dirt y water runs down and off the hands from the wrists. It is prefer able to use a pump-t ype of liquid soap instead of bar hand soap . Dry hands on paper towels. Use the dry paper towels to turn off the faucets (don' t touch with clean hands). A waterless handw ashing product should be made a vailable for immediate use if a suitable sink is not readily a vailable in the home or work setting. This product does not replace proper handw ashing with soap and w ater. Refer to the manufacturer 's directions for use. People who ha ve been exposed to body fluids should w ash their hands before, as well as after, using the toilet. The paper towel that w as used to dry the hands ma y also be used to open the bathroom door , if necessary , before disposing of the towel. Precautions with Personal Hygiene Items People should not share r azors, toothbrushes, personal towels or w ashcloths, dental hygiene tools, vibr ators, enema equipment, or other personal care items. Cleaning Blood/OPIM Wear appropriate glo ves. Use sterile gauz e or other bandages, and follow normal first -aid techniques to stop the bleeding. After applying the bandage, remo ve the glo ves slowly , so that fluid particles do not splatter or become aerosoliz ed. Hands should be w ashed using good technique as soon as possible. Cleaning Body Fluid Spills o n Vinyl FloorsAny brok en glass should be swept up using a broom and dustpan (nev er bare hands!). Empty the dustpan in a well-mark ed plastic bag or hea vy-duty container . The body fluid spill ma y be pretreated with full-strength liquid disinfectant or detergent. Next, wipe up the body fluid spill with either a mop and hot soap y water or appropriate glo ves and paper towels. Dispose of the paper towels in the plastic bag. Use a good disinfectant such as household bleach 5.25% mix ed fresh with w ater 1:10 to disinfect the area that the spill occurred. If a mop w as used for the cleaning, soak it in a buck et of hot w ater and disinfectant for the recommended time. Empt y the mop buck et water in the toilet, r ather than a sink. Sponges and mops used to clean up body fluid spills should not be rinsed out in the kitchen sink, or in a location where food is prepared. Cleaning Body Fluid Spills o n Carpeting Pour dry kitt y litter or other absorbent material on the spill to absorb the body fluid. Then pour full-strength liquid detergent on the carpet, which helps to disinfect the area. If there are pieces of brok en glass present, the broom- and-dustpan method can be used next to sweep up the kitt y litter and visible brok en glass. Use carpet -safe liquid disinfectant instead of diluted bleach on the carpeting. P our this carefully on the entire contaminated area; let it remain there for the time recommended b y the manufacturer . Follow this b y absorbing the spill with paper towels and sturdy rubber glo ves. Vacuum normally afterw ards. Any debris, paper towels, or soiled kitt y litter should be disposed of in a sealed plastic bag that has been placed inside another plastic garbage bag. T wist and seal the top of the second bag as well. Cleaning Laundry in Home Set tings Clothes, w ashable uniforms, towels, or other laundry that ha ve been stained with blood/OPIM should be cleaned and disinfected before further use. If possible, ha ve the person remo ve the clothing, or use appropriate glo ves to assist with remo ving the clothes. If it is a distance to the w ashing machine, tr ansport the soiled clothing items in a sturdy plastic bag. Next, place the items in the w ashing machine, and soak or w ash the items in cold, soap y water to remo ve any blood from the fabric. Hot w ater permanently sets blood stains. Use hot soap y water for the next w ashing cy cle, and include sufficient detergent, which will act as a disinfectant, in the w ater. Dry the items using a clothes dry er. Wool clothing or uniforms ma y be rinsed with cold soap y water and then dry cleaned to remo ve and disinfect the stain. Apply Your Knowledge Q: A family member of an HIV -positiv e patient asks y ou how to best w ash the patient 's laundry to a void infection with HIV . How would y ou advise her? A: When caring for an HIV -infected person at home, clothes or towels that are contaminated with blood or OPIM should be laundered and disinfected before further use. If there is no blood contamination on clothing, the clothes can be w ashed with regular soap lik e any other clothing. Diaper Changes Care pro viders should use a new pair of appropriate glo ves to change diapers. Glo ves should be remo ved carefully and discarded in the appropriate receptacle. Hands should be washed immediately after changing the diaper . Disinfect the diapering surface afterw ards. Cloth diapers should be w ashed in v ery hot w ater with detergent and a cup of bleach, and dried in a hot clothes dry er. Cleaning Sponges and Mops Sponges and mops that are used in a kitchen should not be used to clean body fluid spills or bathrooms. All sponges and mops should be disinfected routinely with a fresh bleach solution or another similar disinfectant. Toilet/Bedpan Safety It is safe to share toilets/toilet seats without special cleaning, unless the surface becomes contaminated with blood/OPIM. If this occurs, disinfect the surface b y spraying on a solution of 1:10 bleach. W earing glo ves, wipe this a way with disposable paper towels. People with open sores on their legs, thighs, or genitals should disinfect the toilet seat after each use. Urinals and bedpans should not be shared between family members unless they are thoroughly disinfected beforehand. Thermometers Electronic thermometers with disposable co vers do not need to be cleaned between users, unless they are visibly soiled. Wipe the surface with a disinfectant solution if necessary . Glass thermometers should be w ashed with soap and w arm w ater before and after each use. If it will be shared between family members, the thermometer should be soak ed in 70%-90% eth yl alcohol for 30 minutes, then rinsed under a stream of w arm w ater between each use.Pet Care Precautions Certain animals ma y be health hazards for people with compromised immune systems. These animals include turtles, reptiles, birds, puppies and kittens under the age of 8 months, wild animals, pets without current immunizations, and pets with illnesses of unknown origin. Did you know . . . HIV cannot be spread to , from, or b y cats, dogs, birds, or other pets. Pet cages and cat litter bo xes can harbor infectious, sometimes aerosoliz ed organisms. These pet items should be cared for only b y someone who is not immunocompromised. If this is not possible, a mask with a sealable nose clip , and disposable latex glo ves should be worn each time pet care is done. F ollow all pet care with thorough handw ashing. Animals ma y carry a v ariety of diseases harmful to people with weak ened immune systems. Some of these diseases ma y be passed b y the animal licking their person' s face or open wounds. W ash hands after stroking or other contact with pets. K eep cats' and dogs' nails trimmed. W ear latex glo ves to clean up a pet 's urine, feces, or v omitus. The soiled area should be cleaned with a fresh solution of 1:10 bleach. Pet food and w ater bowls should be regularly w ashed in w arm, soap y water, and then rinsed. Cat litter bo xes should be emptied out regularly and w ashed at least monthly . Fish tanks should be k ept clean. It is possible to order disposable latex \"calf -birthing\" glo ves from a v eterinarian for immunocompromised individuals. These glo ves should offer protection from the organisms that are present in the fish tank. Do not let y our pet drink from the toilet, eat other animal' s feces, or eat an y type of dead animal or garbage. It is best to restrict cats to the indoors only . Dogs should be k ept indoors or on a leash. Man y communities ha ve volunteer groups and v eterinarians who will assist people with HIV tak e care of their pets, if needed. Do not hesitate to consult y our veterinarian with y our questions. Kitchen Safety and Proper Food Preparation Wash hands thoroughly before preparing food and use care when tasting food. Use a clean spoon and w ash the spoon after using it once. P eople with HIV infection should a void unpasteuriz ed milk, r aw eggs or products that contain r aw eggs, r aw fish, and cr acked or non-intact eggs. Cook all meat, eggs, and fish thoroughly to kill an y organisms that ma y be present in them. W ash fruits and v egetables thoroughly before eating.Disinfect countertops, sto ves, sinks, refriger ators, door handles, and floors regularly . Use window screens to prev ent insects from entering the room. Discard food that has expired or is past a safe stor age date, shows signs of mold, or smells bad. Use separ ate cutting boards for meat and for fruits and v egetables. Disinfect cutting boards frequently . Avoid wooden cutting boards if possible. Kitchen garbage should be contained in a leakproof , washable receptacle that is lined with a plastic bag. Seal the garbage liner bags and remo ve the garbage frequently . Answer: ATest Your Learning When caring for an HIV -infected person at home: Safe and Legal Disposal of Sharps Disposal of syringes, needles, and lancets is regulated. These items are called sharps. They can carry hepatitis, HIV and other germs that cause disease. Throwing them in the tr ash or flushing them down the toilet can pose health risks for others. R egulations go verning disposal of sharps protect garbage and other utilit y work ers and the gener al public from needle sticks and illness. There are different rules and disposal options for different circumstances. Contact y our local health department to determine which option applies to your situation. Found Syringes in Public Lo cations Syringes that are found in parks, along roadsides, in laundromats, or in other public locations present potential risk for accidental needle sticks. Risks for infection from a found syringe depends on a v ariety of factors, including the amount of time the syringe w as left out, the presence of blood, and the t ype of injury (scr atch v ersus puncture). The risk of HIV infection to a healthcare work er from a needle stick containing HIV -positiv e blood is about 1 in 300, according to CDC data.Clothes or towels that are contaminated with blood or OPIM should be cleaned and disinfected before further use.A. It is not necessary to tak e precautions with blood or OPIM. B. Urinals and bedpans should be disposed of after each use.C. Hands should be w ashed before contact with pets to prev ent tr ansmission of HIV to the animals.D.Anyone with an accidental needle stick requires an assessment b y a medical professional. Clinicians should mak e certain that the injured person had been v accinated against hepatitis B and tetanus and ma y also recommend testing for HIV , HCV , and HBV . If a found syringe is handled, but no needle stick occurred, testing for HIV is not necessary . Handling a syringe is not a risk for HIV tr ansmission. Safe Disp osal of Found Syringes Found used syringes or needles a risk for HIV , HBV , HCV , and other pathogens. Parents and other caregiv ers should mak e sure children understand they should nev er touch a found needle or syringe, but instead should immediately ask a responsible adult for help. Your local health department can pro vide a list of what disposal sites are a vailable to you. For safe disposal of found syringes: If you find a syringe or needle, do not pick it up with y our bare hands. W ear glo ves and use tongs, a sho vel, or a broom and dustpan to pick it up . Hold the needle a way from y our body . Do not break the needle off from the syringe. Needles can carry HIV , hepatitis, and other germs. Do not flush needles or syringes down the toilet! Place used sharps and syringes in a safe container: one with at least a 1-inch opening and a lid that will seal tightly . An empt y plastic laundry detergent, shampoo , pickle, oil, or similar bottle or jar will work. If a glass jar is used, place it into a larger plastic bucket or container that has a tight -fitting lid. Soda cans are not good containers to use because people often try to recy cle discarded cans. Carefully place the needle or syringe into the bottle or jar and seal the lid tightly . Tape it shut for added safet y, and label it with the w arning: Sharps, Do Not R ecycle. The sealed container should not be placed where children might open it. Call y our local health department to determine what disposal sites are a vailable to y ou.

Part V: Legal and Ethical Issues Did you know . . .In the case of HIV or AIDS , reportable means that pro viders who diagnose a person must submit a confidential case report to the local health jurisdiction within 3 da ys. HIV and AIDS Are Reportable Conditions Reporting of HIV and AIDS cases assists local and state officials in tr acking the epidemic. It also allows for effectiv e planning and interv ention to be pro vided in the effort to reduce the transmission of HIV to other people. AIDS and HIV are reportable conditions in W ashington State, b y statute W AC 246- 101. AIDS (medically diagnosed) and symptomatic HIV infection ha ve been reportable conditions in W ashington since 1984 and 1993 respectiv ely. In 1999 asymptomatic HIV infection also became reportable. Anonymous Tests and Reporting Positiv e HIV results obtained through anon ymous testing are not reportable. Howev er, once a patient with positiv e results seeks medical care for conditions related to HIV or AIDS , the provider is required to report the case to the local health department. Answer: ATest Your Learning Positiv e HIV test results obtained through anon ymous testing are not reportable to the health department unless that person seeks medical care for conditions related to HIV or AIDS: Spousal Notification Federal Public La w 104-146 (1996) requires that states tak e action to require that a \"good faith effort \" be made to notif y all spouses of HIV -infected people. A spouse is defined as anyone who is or has been the marriage partner of an HIV -infected individual within 10 years prior to the HIV diagnosis. Notification means that individuals testing positiv e will be counseled about the importance of notif ying spouses and partners and will be giv en the choice to notif y, to allow the healthcare pro vider to notif y, or to refer to the local health jurisdiction for assistance in notifying the spouse.True A. False B.Confidentiality All medical records are confidential and must be maintained in a manner that protects that confidentialit y. Confidentialit y of medical information means that a person' s medical information (including HIV testing and HIV results) ma y not be disclosed to an yone unless the individual signs a release-of -information form. Howev er, there are ex ceptions to this. Medical information can be disclosed under certain circumstances, including: When it is giv en from one healthcare pro vider to another healthcare pro vider for related ongoing medical care of the patient In a life-or -death emergency To a third-part y payer (insur ance pro vider) In reporting notifiable conditions to the local health jurisdiction or the DOH Violation of the abo ve-mentioned la ws is a misdemeanor and ma y result in civil liabilit y actions for reckless or intentional disclosure up to $10,000 or actual damages, whichev er is greater . It is the responsibilit y of the count y's health officer to in vestigate potential breaches of confidentialit y of HIV identif ying information and report them to the Department of Health. Special requirements regarding HIV and AIDS are found in W AC 246-101 and RCW 70.24.105. Additional Confidentiality Protections Some areas of the medical record ha ve additional confidentialit y requirements because disclosure of the information to the wrong person or agency could mean additional harm to the patient. It has been determined that there exists a lev el of prejudice, fear , and discrimination directed at people with these medical conditions. Therefore, there is a balance between civil protection and information access.

Federal and state jurisdictions differ in approaches to disability. The laws also protect HIV-infected and AIDS-diagnosed people from employment discrimination. Employers may not discriminate against people with HIV infections or AIDS in: Employment Recruitment Hiring Transfers Layoffs Terminations Rate of pay Job assignments Leaves of absence, sick leave, any other leave or fringe benefits available by virtue of employment Did you know . . . State and federal laws do not cover all employers. For example, state law does not cover employers with fewer than eight employees, religiously controlled non-profits, and Indian tribes. Discrimination-Free Environment Employers are required to provide and maintain a working environment free of discrimination. They must assure that no harassment, intimidation, or adverse action or personnel distinction is made in terms and conditions of employment based on HIV status.If a worksite situation dev elops that poses the threat of discrimination, it is best pr actice for the emplo yer to pro vide education and supervision to emplo yees in order to end harassment, the use of slurs, or intimidation. An emplo yer should promptly in vestigate allegations of discrimination, tak e appropriate action, and not retaliate against the person who complained. If someone is in a situation in which they feel they are being discriminated against, they should first document the discrimination, speak with their supervisor , and follow the entity's internal process to file a discrimination charge. Howev er, it is not necessary to follow an internal griev ance process. An aggriev ed person can also file directly in state court. A complaint must be filed within 180 da ys of the alleged discriminatory incident. If these remedies do not work, a person should contact the Office for Civil Rights or the W ashington State Human Rights Commission. Reasonable Acco mmodation Emplo yers are responsible for pro viding reasonable worksite accommodations that will enable a qualified disabled emplo yee or job applicant to perform the essential tasks of the particular job . Reasonable accommodation means modifications to a worksite or job , in the context of the entire emplo yer's oper ation, such as: Providing special equipment Altering the work en vironment Allowing flex -time Providing frequent rest breaks Allowing the person to work at home (telecommute) Restructuring the job An emplo yee with a disabilit y must self -identif y and request a reasonable accommodation. The emplo yer must engage in an inter active process with the requestor . The reasonable accommodation gr ant ma y not be exactly the same one as requested b y the emplo yee, but one that is equally effectiv e. The emplo yer does not ha ve to change the essential nature of its work, or engage in undue hardship or hea vy administr ative burdens. The essential functions of the job must be accomplished, with or without reasonable accommodations. Potentially Prejudicial InformationWhen a person goes for a job interview or is hired, it is best pr actice for an emplo yer to refrain from asking questions directed at the perception or presence of HIV infection or AIDS unless the emplo yer has obtained a \"bona fide occupational qualification\" (BFOQ) from their state. It is best pr actice for an emplo yer to refr ain from asking \"lifest yle\" questions, such as inquiring about an applicant 's religion, living arr angements, sexual orientation, or gender identit y. Exceptions to the abo ve are applicants for the U .S. military , the P eace Corps, the Job Corps, and people applying for U .S. citiz enship under feder al law, which supersedes state la w.

Authorities a nd Responsibilities o f Hea lth Officer s The local health officer is the ph ysician hired to direct the oper ations of the local count y's health department or health district. Included in the broad responsibilities of the health officer is the authorit y to: Interview people infected with an STD . Notify sexual or needle-sharing partners of exposure to disease. Order people suspected of being infected to receiv e examination, testing, counseling, or treatment. Issue orders to cease and desist from specific conduct that endangers the public health of others. Court enforcement of these orders can be sought. State la w delineates the standards that must be met before action b y the health officer ma y be tak en. After all less-restrictiv e measures ha ve been exhausted, the la w allows for a person to be detained for periods up to 90 da ys after appropriate hearings and rulings b y a court. This detention must include counseling.For HIV, Washington state law permits an additional step\u2014the detention of an HIV- infected person who continues to endanger the health of others. W ashington State law (RCW 70.24) and rules (WAC 246-100 and 246-101) give state and local health officers the authority and responsibility to carry out certain measures to protect the public health from the spread of STDs, including HIV. Reporting Non-Compliance By state law and rule, healthcare providers are required to provide instruction on infection control measures to the patient who is diagnosed with a communicable disease. They are also required to report certain information to the local health officer where there are either impediments to or refusal to comply with prescribed infection control measures. When a healthcare provider has knowledge that a specific patient is failing to comply with prescribed infection control measures (eg, acquisition of a new STD , sex without disclosure of HIV status to sexual partners, failure to disclose HIV status to needle-sharing partners, donating or selling HIV-infected blood) they should contact the local public health officer to discuss the circumstances of the case and to determine if the name of the person should be reported for investigation and followup. Case Investigation The health officer or other authorized representative will investigate the case if credible evidence exists that an HIV-infected person is engaging in conduct endangering the public health. Other laws and regulations concern endangering behaviors as well as occupational exposures. These may be specific to professions and to the jurisdictions of public health officers.

Men who ha ve sex with men and injecting drug users\u2014 who ma y already be stigmatiz ed and subjected to social and job-related discrimination\u2014ma y encounter ev en more societal pressure and stress with a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS . Ninet y percent of all adults with AIDS are in the prime of life and ma y not be prepared to deal with death and dying. The infections and malignancies that accompan y AIDS\u2014 along with certain medications\u2014can diminish and disfigure the body . People who are living with HIV face the need to pr actice \"safer sex\" and tak e medications for the remainder of their lives. One thing that char acteriz es the grief around AIDS is the repetition of deaths that one person ma y experience. Man y people working with or living with AIDS for y ears ha ve gone to countless funer als and ha ve seen a succession of their friends pass a way. This is sometimes termed chronic grief . Chronic grief intensifies when an individual realiz es that before the grieving process for one death is complete man y more people ma y have died compounding the grieving process. The idea of cumulativ e multiple loss or grief satur ation is not new .

Grief can manifest itself in ph ysical symptoms, including clinical depression, h ypochondria, anxiet y, insomnia, and the inabilit y to get pleasure from normal daily activities. Dealing with these issues ma y lead to self -destructiv e beha viors such as alcohol or drug abuse. Disbelief , numbness, and inabilit y to face facts occur for some. The fear of the unknown, the onset of infections, swollen lymph nodes, loss of weight (or unusual weight gain) can be accompanied b y fear of dev eloping AIDS , or of getting sick er. People infected with HIV/AIDS are often rejected b y family , friends, or co- workers. In some cases, guilt develops about the disease, about past beha viors, or about the possibilit y of ha ving unwittingly infected someone else. People living with HIV ma y feel as though their \"normal\" liv es ha ve completely ended as they must plan detailed medication schedules and medical appointments. The cost of the medications for HIV ma y result in financial hardship , even if the person has medical coverage. Sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, withdr awal, and isolation are often present. Anger is common: at the virus, at the effects of the medications or the failure of some of the medications, at the prospect of illness or death, and at the discrimination that often encountered. Some people with HIV consider suicide or attempt suicide, and some ma y actually kill themselv es.

Call the W ashington State DOH at 877 376 9316 if y ou or someone y ou know needs help pa ying for HIV care and medications.Caregivers Caregiv ers ma y find it necessary to acknowledge their own experiences and feelings when dealing with all aspects of this disease. Good self -care for the caregiv er is important. There are other issues for people who share a home with, or pro vide home care for , people with HIV or AIDS . Often feelings experienced b y the caregiv er will mirror those of the patient; these can include a sense of vulner ability and helplessness. Caregiv ers ma y experience the same isolation as the person with HIV infection. Finding a support system, including a qualified counselor , can be just as important for the caregiv er as for the person who has HIV disease. Support from co- workers can be especially important. Stages of Grief Grief has been described in a v ariety of forms. It ma y be best understood as a process that doesn' t involve a str aight line. P eople do not mo ve predictably step-b y-step through the various stages of their grieving, but progress at their own speed. There seem to be discreet phases of grief , including: Shock and numbing Yearning and searching Disorganization and despair Some degree of reorganization The length of time it tak es to mo ve between these stages is determined b y individuals and their v alues and cultur al norms. In uncomplicated grief , an individual is able to mo ve through these stages and come out of the grieving process. Complicated grief is described as an exagger ation or distortion of the normal process of grieving. P eople experiencing multiple losses are more at risk for complications. If an individual has been impacted b y multiple deaths, it ma y be difficult to reorganiz e (mo ve on) with the process. Things to Do Do meet with a support person, group , or counselor on a regular basis to discuss y our experiences and feelings. Do set limits in caregiving time and responsibilit y, and stick to those limits. Do allow y ourself to ha ve questions. Let \"not knowing\" be OK. Do get the information and support y ou deserv e and need.Do discuss with y our emplo yer ways to reduce stress and burnout. Do remember that Standard Precautions are for the patient 's health and welfare, as well as y our own. Things to A void Don't isolate y ourself . Don't try to be all things to all people. Don't expect to ha ve all the answers. Don't deny your own fears about AIDS or dying. Don't continue to work in an area where y ou can' t cope. Don't dismiss Standard Precautions because y ou know the patient. Special Populations Although HIV infection affects people from all ethnic groups, genders, ages, and income levels, some groups ha ve been significantly affected b y the AIDS epidemic. These groups include men who ha ve sex with men, injecting drug users, people with hemophilia, women, transgender people, and people of color . The following information details how these different populations ma y be uniquely affected b y the AIDS epidemic. Men Who Have Sex with Men American societ y has issues with homosexualit y. Grief ma y not be v alidated when relationships are viewed through prejudice and considered unacceptable. An example of this ma y be the reaction of churches to those who are living with, or ha ve families living with, AIDS . Man y congregants report that they do not get the support they need from their church families because of the stigma attached to HIV , AIDS , and homosexualit y. Self- esteem issues and psy chological issues, including depression, anxiet y, diagnosed mental illness, and risk -taking beha viors, ma y also complicate the liv es of these men. Additionally , there are the issues with HIV -negativ e men who ha ve sex with men. Most of the attention, resources, and services are focused on HIV -positiv e gay men. As with an y behavior change, people can become \"tired\" of safer sex messages, and ma y mak e choices that place them at risk. Some ma y feel that HIV infection is inevitable (although it is not) and purposely engage in unprotected sex. Men who ha ve sex with both men and women (who do not ex clusiv ely self -identif y as ga y) face additional challenges. It is more difficult to reach men who do not identif y as being gay with HIV prev ention efforts and activities. Bisexual men face man y similar challenges as ga y men but ma y not ha ve the social and communit y resources they need.Women Who Have Sex With Women Women who ha ve sex with women, regardless of whether they self -identif y as lesbian or bisexual, are at potentially greater risk than monogamous heterosexual women through their possible use of fingering, or al sex, and sex to ys. The risk is lower than women who have sex with infected men because less bodily fluid is exchanged between women. Safer sex guidelines still apply , including a voiding an y body fluid ex change through v aginal secretions, breast milk, or blood. It is important to a void or al sex if either partner has mouth sores or cuts. Heterosexual Transgender Women These women ha ve very specific risks because societ y at large is only now becoming a ware of them. When their declar ation of tr ansgender is made, they often lose their family support system. T ransgender women often face emplo yment and insur ance discrimination, and the cascade of rejections can lead to a higher lik elihood of doing sex work (Oper ario, 2008). Until now there w as a tendency to include these women in the category of \"men who ha ve sex with men, \" which is not only inaccur ate but also hides the particular reasons they are at higher risk. Injecting Drug Users American societ y also has issues with illegal drug use and with marginaliz ed individuals such as those in po verty and the homeless. P eople who continue to use injecting drugs, despite w arnings and information about risks, ma y be viewed b y some as \"deserving\" their infection. Harm reduction measures lik e syringe ex change progr ams, ha ve been pro ven to reduce the transmission of bloodborne pathogens lik e HIV , because some people believ e that pro viding clean needles and a place to exchange used needles constitutes \"appro val\" of injection drug use. In addition, po verty, self-esteem issues, and psy chological issues (including depression, anxiet y, diagnosed mental illness, and risk -taking beha viors) ma y also complicate the liv es of injecting drug users. The desire to stop using illegal drugs ma y be v ery far apart from the abilit y to stop . The realit y about inpatient treatment facilities is that while there is a large demand for spaces v ery few are a vailable. Man y substance abusers are placed on waiting lists when they w ant treatment, and b y the time there is a place for them, they may be lost to followup . People with HemophiliaHemophiliacs lack the abilit y to produce certain blood clotting factors. Before the adv ent of anti-hemophilic factor concentr ates (\"factor VIII\" or \"factor IX, \" which are clotting material pooled out of donated blood plasma), hemophiliacs could bleed to death. These concentr ates allowed hemophiliacs to receiv e injections of the clotting factors that they lacked, which in turn allowed them to lead relativ ely normal liv es. Unfortunately , because the r aw materials for these concentr ates came from donated blood, many hemophiliacs were infected with HIV prior to the adv ent of blood testing. During the 1980s, 90% of sev ere hemophiliacs contr acted HIV or HCV through use of these products. There is anger within this communit y because there is evidence to show that the companies manufacturing the concentr ates knew their products might be contaminated but continued to distribute them an yway. Some people considered hemophiliacs to be innocent victims of HIV , but there has been discrimination against them. The R yan White Care Act, funding HIV services, and the Ricky Ray Act, which pro vides compensation to hemophiliacs infected with HIV , were both named after HIV -positiv e hemophiliacs who suffered significant discrimination (arson, refusal of admittance to gr ade school) in their home towns. Women with HIV Women in the United States and worldwide are becoming infected with HIV at higher r ates than an y other group of people. This is particularly true of women of color . Women who are infected with HIV , or who ha ve family members who ha ve HIV , face some unique challenges. Women ma y become infected with HIV from a partner who either used injecting drugs or had other sexual partners. Man y of these women assumed that the relationship w as monogamous, or that they \"knew\" their partner 's history . Man y others are unable to discuss or implement safer sex pr actices because they lack the skills or because domestic violence is present in their relationship . Women ma y postpone taking medication, or going to medical appointments, in order to care for their children or other family members. W omen (and also men) ma y fear disclosing their HIV status to others, fearing loss of their jobs, housing, or other forms of discrimination. Single parents with HIV ma y feel particularly fearful because of their lack of support. Many women ha ve problems with lack of tr ansportation, lack of health insur ance, limited education, and low income. They ma y have childcare problems that prev ent them from going to medical appointments.Many women who are infected with HIV do not consider this to be their worst problem. Their symptoms ma y be mild and manageable for man y years. Mean while, they ma y have more pressing concerns, such as their lack of income, housing, access to medical care, possible abusiv e relationships, and concerns about their children. People of Color African Americans and Hispanics ha ve disproportionately higher r ates of AIDS in the United States, despite the fact that there are no biologic reasons for the disparities. African American and Hispanic women mak e up less than 25% of the total U .S. population, but account for 77% of all reported AIDS cases in women. African Americans mak e up about 12% of the population, but account for 37% of all AIDS cases in the United States. Hispanics mak e up about 13% of the population, but account for 20% of the AIDS cases in the United States. In some areas, disparities also exist in the number of AIDS cases in Native Americans. There is no single reason that stands out as to wh y the disparities exist. One factor is health disparities, which are link ed to socioeconomic conditions. Another factor is distrust of the healthcare system. Both legacies of the past and current issues of r ace mean that many people of color do not trust \"the system\" for a v ariety of reasons. Thus, ev en when income is not a barrier , access to early interv ention and treatment ma y be limited. And HIV may be only one of a list of problems that also includes adequate housing, food, and emplo yment. Another factor ma y be the div ersities within these populations. Div ersity is evident in immigr ant status, religion, languages, and geogr aphic locations, as well as socioeconomic conditions. Pro viding targeted information to these div erse populations is challenging. A significant amount of denial about HIV risk continues to exist in these communities. As with other groups, there ma y also be fear and stigmatization of those who ha ve HIV . Prevention messages must be tailored and presented in a cultur ally and linguistically appropriate manner . The messages must be carried through channels that are appropriate for the individual communit y. These channels ma y include religious institutions or respected elders in the communit y. Ironically , it ma y be these institutions or elders who , in the past, ha ve contributed to the misinformation and stigma associated with HIV . Many HIV prev ention progr ams are recognizing the importance of working with div erse communities. Input from these communities must be included in planning, deliv ering, and evaluating HIV prev ention activities. Children with HIVThe major cause of HIV in children under age 13 has been mother to child tr ansmission during pregnancy , childbirth or breastfeeding. T esting for antibodies for newborns is ineffectiv e as the maternal antibodies remain in the infant 's system for up to 18 months. Childhood deaths are related to opportunistic infections and up to 20% of children will acquire an opportunistic infection during their first y ear of life. Simple infections such as colds, fev er, diarrhea, deh ydration, fungal infections from diaper r ash can dev elop into more sev ere infections and longer hospital sta ys.
