Presentation One 10-15 minute slide presentation by each student on a specific product or therapy , including specific supplements for a specific indication (including any those listed below ). Must be an evidence -based review emphasizing the highest level evidence from meta -analyses and large clinical trials when available . Lower level evidence may be presented when high level evidence is absent, or when large observational studies add significant information. The final slide s hould be a list of key take home (testable) points. Each student must pick a topic by October 23, and should submit a draft presentation to me no later than the Mon day prior to their presentation week . At that time the presenter should also submit 3 potential test questions related to key points on the final slide. The final presentation and voice -over should be forwarded to me by the Friday prior to their presentation week.
