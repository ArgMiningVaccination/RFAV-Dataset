[Uncategorized](https://premierechiro.com/category/uncategorized/) [Traditional Chinese medicine](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/traditional-chinese-medicine-what-you-need-to-know) has been an area that has stuck around for centuries in the health field. This holistic approach to medicine has shown many successful treatments for patients with all sorts of chronic health conditions. In today's article, we're going to evaluate the practice of tonification and discuss how it may help you with your medical condition. The basis of traditional Chinese medicine relies on the idea of [Qi](https://acupuncturistseattle.com/what-qi-chi-health/) (pronounced chee), which can be explained most simply as vital [energy](https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/explore-healing-practices/traditional-chinese-medicine/what-qi-and-other-concepts) that constantly flows throughout all objects in life, including the human body. This Qi is known to flow throughout various materials, like computers and animals, and intangible objects, like light and heat. Any good chiropractor El Segundo can explain this concept in more detail. In [tonification](https://www.healthline.com/health/tonification), these channels are referred to as meridians. Each meridian must have an equal balance of yin and yang for a person to feel good. When imbalances in your Qi occur, acupuncture therapy in El Segundo is said to be able to put your Qi back in balance. A balanced Qi results in physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional well-being. A [chiropractor El Segundo](https://premierechiro.com/) may specialize in tonifying the body through massage. This process manipulates and stretches the skin, muscles, and joints of the human body. A common form of massage that is a known tonifier is shiatsu. This uses gentle pressure on the [body's meridians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(Chinese_medicine)) to balance the flow of Qi and promote self-healing. Acupuncture therapy in El Segundo is one of many tonification practices that can be performed on your body to balance your Qi or energy flow. When you undergo [acupuncture El Segundo](https://premierechiro.com/acupuncture/), multiple needles are placed throughout the body. [These needles](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/acupuncture) are said to trigger energy flow throughout the body to help balance the body's Qi. If you're not interested in acupuncture for back pain because of its use of needles, you can undergo acupressure therapy, which is very similar. The only difference is that the practitioner uses their fingers and hands instead of needles to manipulate the body's meridians. Conditions Tonifying Can Treat Acupuncture El Segundo among many other tonifying practices, are said to treat a variety of medical conditions. Some of the most well-known include: - Kidney Problems - Digestive Problems - Lung Issues - Liver Problems - Heart Issues The basis behind why acupuncture for back pain and other conditions is so effective is because they help to enhance the circulation of blood throughout the body. No medical evidence up to this point has notated the existence of Qi in the human body. For this reason, there is a lack of solid medical evidence that tonifying is effective at treating the many health conditions noted above. However, that doesn't stop many believers from undergoing these tonifying treatments. As with most traditional Chinese medicine, many health professionals are unable to find any solid medical proof that proves its source of effectiveness. It's assumed that studies will continue to be conducted on the positive effects that tonifying has on various conditions of the human body. "}
