Common examples include: musculoskeletal pain, insomnia, anxiety, depression, attention deficit disorder, hypothyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, they can help with the side effects of cancer treatments, fatigue, and brain fog. Acupuncture is recommended for various pain conditions by [the CDC and the American College of Physicians](https://www.nwhealth.edu/news/cdc-recommends-chiropractic-care-acupuncture-and-massage-therapy-in-new-opioid-guideline/) and is increasingly being used as a first-line treatment for pain. How Acupuncture Works Acupuncture is a whole-body medicine that uses ultra-fine needles to stimulate prescribed points. Practitioners may also use mild heat, manual pressure, or gentle electrical current. Acupuncture does not focus on treating only symptoms. It looks at the whole picture to treat the underlying causes of imbalance. By stimulating the body to heal itself, acupuncture can reduce the need for drugs and offers a conservative alternative to orthopedic surgery and other riskier therapies. Chinese Herbal Medicine Your practitioner may also prescribe Chinese herbal formulas. These formulas have been developed over thousands of years and are customized to the unique needs of each individual patient.
