These are vaccine](/flu/prevent/adjuvant.htm). - The recommended timing of vaccination is similar to last season. For most people who need only one dose for the season, September and October are generally good times to get vaccinated. Vaccination in July and August is not recommended for most adults but can be considered for some groups. While ideally it's recommended to get vaccinated by the end of October, it's important to know that vaccination after October can still provide protection during the peak of flu season. - The age indication for the cell culture-based inactivated flu vaccine, Flucelvax Quadrivalent (ccIIV4), changed from 2 years and older to 6 months and older. - Pre-filled Afluria Quadrivalent flu shots for children are not expected to be available this season. However, children can receive this vaccine from a multidose vial at the recommended dose. Flu Vaccine [Annual flu vaccination is recommended for everyone 6 months and older, with ] [few exceptions](/flu/prevent/whoshouldvax.htm) as has been the case since 2010. New this season, however, is a preferential recommendation for the use of higher dose and adjuvanted flu vaccines in people 65 and older over standard dose, unadjuvanted flu vaccines. More information on this new recommendation can be found [here.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm) [There are many different flu viruses, and they are constantly changing. The composition of U.S. flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed. The recommendations for the 2022-2023 season include two updates compared with the recommended composition of last season's U.S. flu vaccines. Both the influenza A(H3N2) and the influenza B(Victoria lineage) vaccine virus components were updated.] The recommendations for egg-based and cell-based and recombinant flu vaccines are listed below: vaccine composition recommendations: a virus (B/Yamagata (B/Victoria lineage) (updated); - a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage). This recommendation is the same as the Southern Hemisphere flu vaccine recommendation. For more information, visit [Influenza Vaccine for the 2022-2023 Season | FDA](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/lot-release/influenza-vaccine-2022-2023-season) Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so [supply](/flu/prevent/vaccine-supply-distribution.htm) depends on manufacturers. Vaccine manufacturers have projected that they will supply the United States with as many as 156.2 million to 170 million doses of influenza vaccines for the 2023-2024 season. These projections may change as the season progresses. All flu vaccines for the 2023-2024 season will be quadrivalent (four component). Most will be [thimerosal-free or thimerosal-reduced](/flu/prevent/thimerosal.htm) vaccine (91%), and about 21% of flu vaccines will be egg-free. Yes, for some people. For the 2022-2023 flu season, there are three flu vaccines that are preferentially recommended for people 65 years and older. These are [Fluzone High-Dose flu vaccine](/flu/prevent/adjuvant.htm). There is not a preferential recommendation for one of these three higher dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines over the others. On June 22, 2022, CDC's [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted unanimously](/media/releases/2022/s0630-seniors-flu.html) to preferentially recommend these vaccines over standard-dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines. This recommendation was based on a review of available studies which suggests that, in this age group, these vaccines are potentially more effective than standard dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines. There is no preferential recommendation for people younger than 65 years. If one of the three preferentially recommended flu vaccines for people 65 and older is not available at the time of administration, people in this age group should get a standard-dose flu vaccine instead. CDC has annual educational campaigns to increase awareness about the importance of seasonal flu vaccination. For the 2022-2023 season, CDC will continue to emphasize the importance of flu vaccination beginning in September and for the entire flu season. The agency will conduct targeted communication outreach to specific groups of people who are at higher risk for developing serious complications from flu. Communication strategies for providers and the public will include: - Educational outreach activities by CDC, including social media, press conferences, web page spotlights, radio media tours, op-eds, and other publications. - Special educational efforts and a digital campaign to inform the general population, people with underlying health conditions, children, pregnant people, and African American and Hispanic audiences about the importance of flu vaccination. In addition, as part of its new [Partnering for Vaccine Equity](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/health-equity/index.html) program, CDC has provided more than $150 million in funding to support national, state, local, and community-level partners working to increase confidence in COVID-19 and flu vaccines among adults in racial and ethnic minority groups. If you don't have a health care provider you regularly see, you can find flu vaccines at many places, including health departments and pharmacies. It's best to be vaccinated before flu begins spreading in your community. September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated against flu. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. However, even if you are not able to get vaccinated until November or later, vaccination is still recommended because flu most commonly peaks in February and significant activity can continue into May. Additional considerations concerning the timing of vaccination for certain groups include: - Adults, especially those 65 years and older, should generally not get vaccinated early (in July or August) because protection may decrease over time, but early vaccination can be considered for any person who is unable to return at a later time to be vaccinated. [Some children](/flu/highrisk/children.htm#anchor_1577721999236)need two doses of flu vaccine. For those children it is recommended to get the first dose as soon as vaccine is available, because the second dose needs to be given at least four weeks after the first. Vaccination during July and August also can be considered for children who need only one dose. Early vaccination can also be considered for people who are in the third trimester of pregnancy, because this can help protect their infants during the first months of life (when they are too young to be vaccinated). Flu Vaccine and COVID-19 Vaccine Coadministration [Yes, you can get a COVID-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine at the same time if you are eligible and the timing coincides.] Even though both vaccines can be given at the same visit, people should follow the recommended schedule for either vaccine: If you haven't gotten your currently recommended doses of COVID-19 vaccine, get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can, and ideally get a flu vaccine by the end of October. Visit [Getting a Flu Vaccine and a COVID-19 Vaccine at the Same Time](/flu/prevent/coadministration.htm) for more information. [Studies conducted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic indicate that it is safe to get both a COVID-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine at the same visit. A recent ] [CDC study published in JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2794318) suggests people who received a flu vaccine and an mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccine at the same time were slightly more likely (8% to 11%) to report systemic reactions including fatigue, headache, and muscle ache than people who only received a COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine, but these reactions were mostly mild and resolved quickly. The findings of this study are consistent with safety data from clinical trials that did not identify any serious safety concerns with coadministration. If you have concerns about getting both vaccines at the same time, you should speak with a health care provider. Visit [Getting a Flu Vaccine and a COVID-19 Vaccine at the Same Time](/flu/prevent/coadministration.htm) for more information. [Yes, you can get a flu vaccine at the same time you get a COVID-19 vaccine, including a COVID-19 booster shot.] Visit [Getting a Flu Vaccine and a COVID-19 Vaccine at the Same Time](/flu/prevent/coadministration.htm) for more information. [Yes, children who are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination can get a COVID-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine at the same visit.] If your child is [eligible](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html), get them up to date on their recommended COVID-19 vaccine and annual flu vaccine as soon as possible. You can get both vaccines at the same time, but don't delay either vaccination in order to get them both at the same visit. Both vaccines are recommended, and your child should get the recommended doses for each vaccine. All children 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine. Most children will only need one dose of flu vaccine. Your child's healthcare provider can tell you if your child needs two doses of flu vaccine. Visit [Getting a Flu Vaccine and a COVID-19 Vaccine at the Same Time](/flu/prevent/coadministration.htm) for more information. Flu Activity [Flu viruses are constantly changing so it's not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year. More information is available at ] [how flu viruses change](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm). Flu Vaccine Coverage [CDC's Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard](/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-dashboard.html) will again provide preliminary, within-season, weekly influenza vaccination data which will be updated during the season as more data become available. The first posting of vaccine coverage data for the season is expected in early October. Visit the [National Flu Vaccination Dashboard](/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-dashboard.html) for more information. [Flu vaccination coverage among children is assessed through the ] [National Immunization Survey-Flu](/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/about.html) ( [NIS-Flu](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/about.html)), which provides weekly flu vaccination coverage estimates for children 6 months-17 years old. NIS-Flu is a national random-digit-dialed cellular telephone survey of households conducted during the flu season (October-June). Additional information about NIS-Flu methods and estimates from 2021-2022 season are available at [FluVaxView](/flu/fluvaxview/index.htm). Visit [CDC's Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard](/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-dashboard.html) for more information. [Flu vaccination coverage estimates among pregnant people are available via ] [CDC's Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard](/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-dashboard.html). These estimates are based on electronic health record (EHR) data from the [Vaccine Safety Datalink](/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/index.html) (VSD), a collaboration between CDC's Immunization Safety Office and nine integrated health care organizations. Of note, because these estimates are based on data from nine integrated health care systems, they may not be representative of all pregnant people in the United States. [CDC tracks the number of flu vaccines administered at pharmacies and doctor's offices by utilizing new sources of vaccination data, including ] [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/) data for vaccinations administered in retail pharmacies (e.g., pharmacy chains, mass merchandise, food stores, and independent pharmacies) and doctors' offices. Visit [CDC's Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard](/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-dashboard.html) for more information. [CDC's Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard](/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-dashboard.html) provides preliminary, within-season, weekly flu vaccination data which will be updated during the season as more data become available. The first posting of vaccine coverage data for the season is expected in early October. Visit the [National Flu Vaccination Dashboard](/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-dashboard.html) for more information. [Click here](/flu/fluvaxview/earlier-seasons.htm) for vaccination coverage estimates from past flu seasons. CDC will continue to provide end-of-season estimates of flu vaccination coverage from these data sources. Seasonal Flu and COVID-19 Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. You cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 by symptoms alone because some of the symptoms are the same. Some PCR tests can differentiate between flu and COVID-19 at the same time. If one of these tests is not available, many [testing locations](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/community-based-testing-sites/index.html) provide flu and COVID-19 tests separately. Talk to a healthcare provider about getting tested for both flu and COVID-19 if you have symptoms. Learn more button: [Similarities and Differences between Flu and COVID-19 | CDC](/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm) While difficult to predict what will happen in the fall and winter, CDC expects SARS-CoV-2 to continue to spread during the fall and winter along with flu viruses. Your health care professional may order a test to help confirm whether you have flu or COVID-19 or some other illness. Get more information on COVID-19 and [flu testing](/flu/symptoms/testing.htm) and [symptoms of COVID-19 and flu](/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm). Yes. There are tests that will check for seasonal influenza A and B viruses and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Testing for these viruses at the same time gives public health officials important information about how flu and COVID-19 are spreading and what prevention steps people should take. These tests also help public health laboratories save time and testing materials, and possibly return test results faster. More [information for laboratories](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/multiplex.html) is available. Yes. It is possible to have flu and other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, at the same time. This is called a coinfection. Because COVID-19 is still a relatively new illness, we have little information about how flu illness might affect a person's risk of getting COVID-19. No. Flu vaccines do not protect against COVID-19. Flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness, hospitalization, and death in addition to having been shown to have other important [benefits](/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm). Likewise, [getting a COVID-19 vaccine](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/your-vaccination.html) is the best protection against COVID-19, but those vaccines do not protect against flu. Visit the CDC's [FAQ](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html) page for information about COVID-19 vaccinations. No. There is no evidence that getting a flu vaccination raises your risk of getting sick from COVID-19 or any other coronavirus. ( [Common human coronaviruses](/coronavirus/general-information.html) usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold.) Health care professionals may have different practices for diagnosing and treating flu during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as wearing masks in a health care setting or offering [telemedicine](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/global-covid-19/telemedicine.html). If you have flu symptoms and are at [higher risk of serious flu complications](/flu/highrisk/index.htm), you should call your health care professional as soon as possible to tell them about your symptoms. They may decide to treat you with flu antiviral medications. Follow the recommendations of your health care provider and CDC for [doctor visits](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html). The past two flu seasons have seen historically low levels of flu. We might expect to see more coinfections as flu activity increases and as COVID-19 continues to spread. Yes. CDC is tracking flu and COVID-19 coinfections through its surveillance systems: - CDC uses [FluSurv-NET](/flu/weekly/influenza-hospitalization-surveillance.htm)and [COVID-NET](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covid-net/purpose-methods.html)to see how many people who are hospitalized with a positive lab test for flu that also have a positive lab test COVID-19.. - CDC can look at data from public health labs to see how many specimens tested for both flu and COVID-19 were positive for both. - Based on data in FluSurv-NET and COVID-NET, for the 2021-2022 season (between October 1, 2021 through April 30, 2022), 5.4% of patients hospitalized with flu also had COVID-19. - During the 2021-2022 season, of the flu positive tests reported by public health labs and also tested for COVID, a little more than 4% of tests were positive for both flu and COVID-19. CDC will provide data from the current 2022-2023 season as it becomes available. Getting a Flu Vaccine During the COVID-19 Pandemic Yes. Getting a flu vaccine is an essential part of protecting your health and your family's health every year. Take recommended [precautions](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) to protect yourself from COVID-19 while getting your flu vaccine. Yes. Wearing a mask and avoiding crowds and others who are sick can help protect you and others from respiratory viruses, like flu and the virus that causes COVID-19. However, the best way to reduce your risk of flu illness and its potentially serious complications is for everyone 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine each year. By getting a flu vaccine, you may also be protecting people around you who are more vulnerable to serious flu complications. Information for Health care Professionals for Administering Flu Vaccine during the COVID-19 Pandemic CDC developed [ guidance on drive-through vaccination clinics](/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass-clinic-activities/curbside-vaccination-clinics.html) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Curbside and drive-through vaccination clinics are an option for vaccination clinics. No. Flu vaccination should be deferred for people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, whether or not they have symptoms, until they have met the [criteria](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html) to discontinue their isolation. While mild illness is not a contraindication to flu vaccination, vaccination visits for these people should be postponed to avoid exposing health care personnel and other patients to the virus that causes COVID-19. When scheduling or confirming appointments for flu vaccination, patients should be instructed to notify the health care professional's office or clinic in advance if they currently have or develop any symptoms of COVID-19. Flu vaccination should be deferred until a patient is no longer acutely ill. This may be different for patients who are already being cared for in a medical setting than it is for patients who are isolating at home. In a medical setting, the timing for vaccination is a matter of clinical discretion. In general, patients who are isolating at home should wait until they meet [criteria for leaving isolation](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html) (even if they have no symptoms) to come to a vaccination setting in order to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others. CDC has [guidance](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html) for when people can be around others after having COVID-19. CDC released [Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic](/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html). This guidance is intended to help vaccination providers in a variety of clinical and alternative settings with the safe administration of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care professionals who give vaccines should also consult guidance from state, local, tribal, and territorial health officials. Clinicians, for more information visit, [Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Dosage & Administration | CDC](/flu/about/qa/vaxadmin.htm) Best practices for [administering more than one vaccine](/vaccines/hcp/admin/administer-vaccines.html), including COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines, include: - When preparing more than one vaccine, label each with the name and dosage (amount) of vaccine, lot number, the initials of the preparer, and the exact beyond-use time, if applicable. - Always inject vaccines into different injection sites. Separate injection sites by 1 inch or more, if possible so that any local reactions can be differentiated. Each muscle (deltoid, vastus lateralis) has multiple injection sites. - If administered at the same time, COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines that might be more likely to cause a local injection site reaction (for example, [high-dose and adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines](/flu/prevent/adjuvant.htm)) should be administered in different limbs, if possible. - Inject vaccines rapidly without aspiration since aspiration is not recommended before administering a vaccine. - There are many existing resources on administration and co-administration of vaccines relevant for health care providers, including: [Pink Book: Vaccine Administration Length (cdc.gov)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/downloads/vaccine-administration-needle-length.pdf) [Vaccine Administration: Intramuscular (IM) Injection Children 7 through 18 years of age](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/downloads/IM-Injection-children.pdf)and [Vaccine Administration: Intramuscular (IM) Injection Adults 19 years of older](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/downloads/IM-Injection-adult.pdf) [Intramuscular (IM) Injection: Sites Hadler S. Simultaneous administration of childhood vaccines: an important public health policy that is safe and efficacious. Pediatr Infect Dis J 1994;13(5):394-407](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8072822/) [COCA Call: 2021-2022 Influenza Vaccination Recommendations and Guidance on Coadministration with COVID-19 Vaccines](https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/2021/callinfo_090921.asp) - You can get your flu vaccine as you normally do, whether that's through your health care provider or your local pharmacist. CDC has been working with health care providers and state and local health departments on how to vaccinate people against flu without increasing their risk of exposure to respiratory viruses, like the virus that causes COVID-19, and has released [Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic](/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html). More information is available in the ' [Administering Flu Vaccines during the COVID-19 Pandemic](/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2020-2021.htm#Administering-Flu-Vaccines-During-the-COVID-19-Pandemic)' section below. This guidance is current for this season. Applying infection prevention practices to all patient encounters is very important, including physical distancing when possible, wearing masks, hand hygiene, surface decontamination, and source control while in a health care facility. The potential for asymptomatic spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 underscores the importance of these practices. Immunization providers should refer to the guidance developed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in [health care settings](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html), including [outpatient and ambulatory care settings](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/facility-planning-operations.html). Yes. Guidance has been developed for giving vaccines at pharmacies, [temporary, off-site, or satellite clinics](https://www.izsummitpartners.org/content/uploads/2019/02/off-site-vaccination-clinic-checklist.pdf), and [large-scale influenza clinics.](/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass-clinic-activities/index.html) Other approaches for vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic may include drive-through immunization services at fixed sites, curbside clinics, mobile outreach units, and home visits. - The general principles outlined for [health care facilities](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/facility-planning-operations.html)should also be applied to alternative vaccination sites, with additional precautions for physical distancing that are particularly relevant for large-scale clinics in communities with high levels of COVID-19 transmission. Read more in the [Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic](/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html). More information is also available in the ' [Administering Flu Vaccines during the COVID-19 Pandemic](/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2020-2021.htm#Administering-Flu-Vaccines-During-the-COVID-19-Pandemic)' section below. Testing and Treatment of Respiratory Illness when SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Viruses are Co-circulating While waiting on [results of testing](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html), non-hospitalized persons with acute respiratory symptoms should isolate at home. Even if people test negative for both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses, they should isolate because of the potential for false negative [testing results](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antigen-tests-guidelines.html) - depending upon [what kind of test](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/naats.html) was done (e.g., [antigen test, molecular test](/flu/professionals/diagnosis/index.htm)) and the level of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus transmission in the community. Persons not hospitalized with suspected or confirmed influenza who are at [increased risk](/flu/highrisk/index.htm) for complications from influenza should receive [antiviral treatment for influenza](/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm) as soon as possible, regardless of illness duration. For hospitalized patients, empiric oseltamivir treatment should be started as soon as possible for patients with suspected influenza without waiting for influenza testing results. Get more information on [testing and treatment when SARS-CoV-2 and flu viruses are co-circulating](/flu/professionals/diagnosis/index.htm). CDC has developed [clinical algorithms](/flu/professionals/diagnosis/index.htm) that can help guide decisions for influenza testing and treatment when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are co-circulating. FDA-approved antiviral medications for treatment of influenza have no activity against SARS-CoV-2 viruses, nor do they interact with medications used for treatment of COVID-19 patients. If a patient who is at higher risk for influenza complications is diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus co-infection, they should receive antiviral treatment for influenza. "}
