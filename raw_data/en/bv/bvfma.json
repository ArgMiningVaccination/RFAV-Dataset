Although created to do good, there are also undesirable side effects that can occur due to a vaccination. A plethora of different studies and stories show that harmful results may come from certain vaccinations. The Institute of Medicine Committee found that the current vaccinations recommended have not been fully tested for safety2. There are still some questions when it comes to this topic. Some symptoms that can occur after receiving a vaccination include swelling or redness at the injection site, hives or rashes, a state of shock, crying, fever, muscle weakness, fatigue, and paralysis2. Aside from basic physical and emotional side effects like these, the shots are said to be linked to other more serious diseases and disorders as well. Asthma, ADD, Tourette's Syndrome, epilepsy, and autism are all said to be possibly correlated with vaccinations2. A specific vaccination concerned parents think about is the MMR. Short for \"measles, mumps, and rubella\", this vaccination was created to protect children against those specific diseases. The CDC recommends that children receive this vaccine in two doses between the ages of 12 months and 12 years3. With rises in reported ASD's (autism spectrum disorders) since more kids have been receiving MMR, parents are starting to see a correlation between the disorder and the treatment1. Every vaccine given and trusted by doctors also comes with a risk, like anything. This risk can range from a slight soreness to even death, in some cases. Choosing Not to Vaccinate The CDC already advises that pregnant women not get MMR, for it can harm the baby4 - this itself should be an alarm that this vaccination and more might not be the right option for you and your children. Before deciding to inject your children, be wary of the risks you're taking. You might be saving them from a deadly disease - yet, you might be exposing them to one instead. "}
