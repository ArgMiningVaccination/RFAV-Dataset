This means they're essentially found everywhere, and since nobody checks air particles at the border, it's a good bet that if it's ubiquitous in the US it's common in Canada too: - Xylenes - Tetrachloroethylene - Ethylbenzene - Benzene - 1,1,1-trichloroethane You also may have been exposed to these chemicals in your every day life.
