When we talk spiritually about vaccines, we need to be rigorous and discerning. Like so many unpleasant encounters today, this one began on Facebook. I got a message from someone I had met once at a spiritual retreat. We had a pleasant time together, connected on social media, and then never crossed paths again. Out of the blue, she showed up via Messenger with a screenshot of a post (see below) warning me that taking a Covid-19 vaccine would somehow block my divine connection to spirit and eliminate my chakras.

If you're awakened spiritually and know not to believe every thought that passes through your mind, why should you believe random thoughts passing through your FB feed from a stranger without at least subjecting them to some minimal standard of scrutiny?

Next, separate and apart from their authority, consider whether the information they provide bears indicia of reliability. Look at the clarity and detail of their opinion; obvious holes, gaps in information, or leaps in logic should be warning signs. Finally, consider whether they offer corroborating evidence of some kind, such as data... "}
