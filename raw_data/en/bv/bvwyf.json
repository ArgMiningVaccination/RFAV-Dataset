Beaty, MSPH, andAllison Kempe, MD, MPH Introduction: Since 2009, pharmacists in all 50 states have been authorized to provide vaccinations to adults. The objective of this study was to assess primary care physicians' (PCPs) experiences with and attitudes about pharmacists administering vaccinations. Methods: Internet and mail survey of PCPs representative of American College of Physicians' and American Academy of Family Physicians' memberships. Results: Response rate was 69% respondents agreed (79% \"Strongly,\" 19% \"Somewhat\") that it is their responsibility to assure their adult patients receive recom- mended vaccinations. Most respondents agreed that pharmacists either did not have access to patient medical information (33% \"Strongly,\" 45% \"Somewhat\") or did not have adequate vaccination history (33% \"Strongly,\" 41% \"Somewhat\"). The majority also agreed that pharmacists inform themwhen vaccinations were given (35% that it is helpful to have pharmacists share the role ofvaccinating adults. Conclusions: PCPs have mixed feelings about pharmacists delivering vaccines. Universal use of IISs by pharmacists could partially address physicians' concerns by providing a systematic way for pharma-cists and physicians to share patient vaccination histories.

Keywords: Immunization, Pharmacists, Primary Care Physicians, Primary Health Care, Surveys and Questionnaires, Vaccines Introduction Adult vaccinations have proven effective at prevent- ing morbidity and mortality as well as protecting the community from vaccine-preventable diseases, yet vaccines for adults are underused.1Vaccinationshave traditionally been delivered in physician prac-tices, hospitals, and public health systems. Pharmacists administering vaccinations has been a rapidly growing practice since the 1990s. Since2009, pharmacists in all 50 states have been author-ized to provide vaccinations, and during the 2014 to 2015 in fluenza season, 22% of adults received a vaccination at a retail pharmacy. 2-4 As more pharmacists deliver vaccinations, there has been increased discussion surrounding the pharmacist 'sThis article was externally peer reviewed.

Downloaded from role in administering vaccinations, including dialog around how receipt of a vaccination in a pharmacywould affect the patient 's\"medical home. \" 4In 2007, the\"Joint Principles of the Patient-Centered Medical Home \"was issued, outlining an approach to provide comprehensive primary care for children, youth, andadults. These principles outline the importance of theuse of information technology and communication for coordinated care across all disciplines within the com- plex health care system. 5To address the concerns of how vaccinations received in a pharmacy would affectthe integrity of the patient 's\"medical home, \"the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) pub- lished \"Standards for Adult Immunization Practice \" that highlighted the critical role that all vaccine pro-viders have in improving vaccination coverage as well as documenting receipt of vaccination. 6The American Pharmacist Association coined the term \"immunization neighborhood \"outlining a collaborative approach to providing vaccinations.4,6,7Pharmacists have an impor- tant role in providing vaccinations to adults due to sev-eral vaccines being covered by Medicare Part D, apharmaceutical bene t; therefore, they can play a large role in establishing an immunization neighborhood.Thus, understanding primary care physicians' (PCPs) perceptions and experience with pharmacists adminis-tering vaccinations is a fundamental next step for fur-thering this relationship. 7 This study aimed to assess PCPs 'experience with and attitudes about pharmacists administering vaccinations to their adult patients. Methods Study Setting From January to February 2019, we administered a survey to physicians who spent at least half their time practicing primary care. The survey was conducted by the Vaccine Policy Collaborative Initiative, a sur- vey effort that assesses physician attitudes about vac- cine issues in collaboration with the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC). We estab- lished a network of PCPs by recruiting general inter- nal medicine physicians (GIMs) and family practice physicians (FPs) from the membership of the American College of Physicians (ACP) and theAmerican Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). We performed quota sampling to ensure that net- works of physicians were comparable to the ACP and AAFP memberships with respect to practice setting, region, and urban versus rural location. 8,9Survey Design We used 4-point Likert scales for assessing physi- cian agreement with statements about delivery ofvaccinations to adult patients by pharmacists (\"Strongly Agree \"to\"Strongly Disagree \"). A national advisory panel of GIMs (n = 6) and FPs(n = 5) pretested the survey, which was modi ed based on their feedback. We pilot tested the survey among 71 GIMs and 13 FPs nationally and further modi ed the survey instrument based on their feedback. Survey Administration Depending on individual physician preference, the survey was administered through US mail or the Internet (using Qualtrics). We sent the mail group an initial mailing and up to 2 additional mail reminders and the Internet group an initial e-mailwith up to 8 e-mail reminders. Nonrespondents in the Internet group were also sent up to 2 mail sur- veys in case of problems with e-mail communica- tion reminders. 9 Statistical Analysis We pooled Internet and mail surveys for analy- ses.8,10-12We compared characteristics of respond- ents with nonrespondents and responses by type ofpractitioner (GIM FP) and practice setting (pri- vate practice, for continuous variables and Pearsons 'sc 2or Fisher 's exact tests for categorical variables, as appropriate.Characteristics of nonrespondents were obtained from the recruitment survey for the sentinel net- works. All analyses were performed using SAS, ver- sion 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results The overall response rate was 69% (642/926), withGIM response rate of 74% (364/494) and FP response rate of 64% (278/432). Respondents were on average younger and had a larger median num- ber of providers in their practice. Respondents did not differ from nonrespondents by other practiceand physical characteristics (Table 1). Ninety-eight percent of respondents agreed (79% \"Strongly, \"19% \"Somewhat \") that it is their responsibility to see that their adult patients receiverecommended vaccines even if they get them out- side of the practice.

Downloaded from patient medical information (33% \"Strongly, \"45% \"Somewhat \") or did history (33% \"Strongly, \"41% \"Somewhat \")t o determine if an adult needs a vaccination, with more GIMs strongly agreeing that pharmacists do not have access to patient medical information than FPs ( P=.005). The majority also reported that pharmacists did not inform them when vaccines are given (35% \"Strongly, \"39% \"Somewhat \") and did not immunizationinformation systems (IISs) (20% \"Strongly, \"37% \"Somewhat \") (Figure 1). There were no other dif- ferences in responses between type of practitioneror practice setting. Discussion This study found that a high proportion of physi- cians had concerns that pharmacists do not haveaccess to adequate patient medical information or vaccination history to determine if an adult needs a vaccination, that pharmacists do not inform them when vaccinations are given, and that they do not enter vaccinations administered into an IIS. Thesendings suggest that collaboration between PCPs and pharmacists needs improvement. Despite theseconcerns, a large majority of respondents felt that it is helpful to have pharmacists share the role of vac- cinating adults with physicians, and 50% agreedthat it is more convenient for adults to get vaccina- tions at a pharmacy than at their practice, high- lighting the important role pharmacists have in providing adult vaccinations as part of an immuni-zation neighborhood. Pharmacists play a key role in providing vaccina- tions to adults. First, some adult vaccines are coveredby Medicare Part D, a pharmaceutical bene t, and therefore cannot easily be delivered in a PCP of ce. Medicare Part B, an of ce-based bene t, provides coverage for most vaccines that adult patients need,including hepatitis B, in fluenza, and pneumococcal vaccines and vaccines directly related to treatment ofan injury or direct exposure to a disease or condition.Medicare Part D covers all commercially availablevaccines, except those covered by Part B. 13Ar e c o g - nized challenge in the delivery of adult vaccines is the presence of these various Medicare plans.14There are platforms (TransactRX\u00a9) by which PCPs can bill for Medicare Part D covered vaccines, though this process can be cumbersome; therefore, it is often lesscomplicated for patients to receive vaccinations cov-ered by Medicare Part D at a pharmacy. Having alladult vaccines covered by Medicare Part B has beenconsidered but ultimately decided against, 15,16thus care needs to be given to better systematicallyimprove the current process. Second, the practice ofpharmacists providing adult vaccinations has substan-tially increased since 1995. 17Not only are more US-Table 1.

Downloaded from based pharmacy schools incorporating vaccination practices into their curriculum but more than 90% of the US population lives within 2 miles of a pharmacy, making pharmacy-based immunization services amore convenient way to obtain an important healthservice. 18-20 Alongside PCPs 'reported concerns about phar- macists giving vaccinations, pharmacists have alsoreported barriers including lack of time or staff at the pharmacy and inadequate vaccination exper- tise. 21Knowing that both PCPs and pharmacists have concerns and recognizing that pharmacists are an integral part of the immunization neighborhoodis important for furthering the pharmacist -provider relationship. These ndings and known challenges highlight key opportunities for pharmacists to ensure they are following NVAC published stand-ards and establishing immunization neighborhoods.The NVAC standards state that all vaccinators, pharmacists included, incorporate routine immu- nization assessment into daily interactions withpatients, administer recommended and needed vaccinations, provide patients with vaccine infor- mation, record the vaccination in the vaccineregistry, and communicate receipt of vaccination with the patient 's medical home as well as serve asFigure 1.

Downloaded from a role model for patients.4,6Pharmacists ful lling the NVAC standards, speci cally recording within the IIS and communicating receipt of vac- cination to the patient 's medical home, will help to strengthen the immunization neighborhoodsthat have already been established and would help to address the concerns raised by PCPs. Documentation of vaccination by pharmacists within their employer 's electronic medical record is likely occurring on a consistent basis, but it is not standard practice across the United States that phar- macists are documenting within the IIS. A 2014 survey by the American Immunization Registry Associationassessed pharmacy reporting of vaccinations to an IIS.Of the 45 state IISs that responded, 36 (80%) reportedthat pharmacies reported vaccinations to the IIS, but only 22 (49%) states had mandatory reporting laws for pharmacies. 22The variation among states as well as not having mandatory reporting laws or a stream-lined process for reporting in all states impacts theability for pharmacists to adequately report receipt of vaccination to an IIS and highlights the need for changes in policies and procedures. There are both strengths and limitations to our study. The results of this study were generated from PCPs across the nation with an overall excel- lent response rates for a physician survey. Althoughthe sample of PCPs was designed to be representa-tive of ACP and AAFP memberships, the experi-ence and attitudes reported may not be fullygeneralizable. In addition, nonrespondents may have had different views or experiences with phar- macists giving vaccinations than respondents did. To our knowledge, this is the rst survey to assess the physician 's perspective on the role of pharmacists in delivering vaccinations. These nd- ings illustrate that PCPs have mixed feelings aboutpharmacists delivering vaccinations to adults.Greater use of the IIS and communication by phar-macists to the patient 's medical home could par- tially address physicians 'concerns by providing a systematic way for pharmacists and physicians toshare patient vaccination history.
