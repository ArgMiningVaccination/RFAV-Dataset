And why not? Popular culture has spread the \"right-brain\" vs \"left-brain\" theorem around like mad. Most case studies involving meditation focus on its involvement in cultivating a stronger \"right-brain\" mindset. But the reality is that, if we allow it, our \"left-brain\" can offer many advantages in meditation. It's a subject that we hear little about, but the logical and the rational mind was something Robert Monroe thought to be an essential tool in meditation and out-of-body experiences. First, let me give a quick explanation for those who are not well acquainted with the left-brain vs right-brain premise. This turn of phrase comes from a centuries-old theory discussing which side of the brain is more dominant and how that affects a person's personality. Those who tend to be more creative and artistic are often called \"right brained,'' while those who are more logical and analytical are referred to as \"left brained.\" Second, as brain science progresses, recent studies postulate that the left-brain/right-brain dominance classifications are not literally accurate. As many scientific theorems go, it is being regularly challenged and evolving with new ideas. However, for the purposes of this article, we are referring to the societal trend of calling someone left-brained vs right-brained. We can consider a left-brain perspective to imply a strong intuitive bent, and a right-brain perspective to imply a strong linear, analytic bent. If we allow it, our \"left-brain\" can offer many advantages in meditation. The advantages of the left brain in your meditation Bob Monroe specifically found the logical, rational mind helped him to remain focused on his objectives during his out-of-body experiences, and to help him retain memory of his experiences with great clarity. I'm sure all of us who meditate heavily have been there. I have dived so deeply into my meditations while taking a program at the Monroe Institute that I've fully released logic and completely and creatively played. When being called back after whichever exercise I was caught up in, my full recollection of what I had experienced had almost entirely dissipated, like a dream floating on the wind. I couldn't recall anything, despite knowing that I had a pretty in-depth, important experience. One of my major objectives in meditation is recording and understanding my experiences to help improve my life. Losing recall of a full meditational experience is very counterproductive to what I'm trying to accomplish. So, with that being said, I do agree it is essential to utilize your logical (or \"left\" brain) in your meditation practice to help retain your experiences and to be able to recall them. Aside from that, many of us choose objectives prior to going into a mediation, especially those of us who rely more on our rational minds. We tend to be goal-driven people. I always pick an objective that is important for me prior to any mediation, even one as simple as \"I'd like to cultivate feelings of gratitude.\" As I'm sure you all know, especially when utilizing Monroe Sound Science, your meditations can take you on wild journeys. You can easily get sidetracked on your out-of-body adventures if you don't have something keeping you focused. That's another place where your theoretical left brain can be of great service to you. The logical part of your brain can help you to stay grounded in your intention and focused on your objectives so you don't get too sidetracked on your adventures. It can be your anchor, if you will, to your objectives. The advantages of balance in your meditations I won't go into detail on the importance of the right brain in your meditation, as that information can be found everywhere. Almost everyone who writes about or studies meditation focuses on meditation as a creative, \"right-brained\" outlet. What makes the Monroe Institute and Bob Monroe's work so important, in my opinion, is Monroe's idea of implementing both sides of the brain, both the rational and creative mind, into his out-of-body work in other reality systems. The benefits are clearly profound. The logical part of your brain can help you to stay grounded in your intention and focused on your objectives so you don't get too sidetracked on your adventures. It can be your anchor, if you will, to your objectives. For myself, while utilizing Monroe Sound Science, I have had some of the most artistically creative, deep, and moving experiences,hub while still being able to rationalize them and record them for analysis. And that, right there, is the importance of having balance in your meditations. You can go on these profound adventures using your creative side and utilize your logical mind to help you stay grounded and focused throughout the experience. The end result creates a deep, meaningful journey within yourself that only those who have truly experienced it can understand.
