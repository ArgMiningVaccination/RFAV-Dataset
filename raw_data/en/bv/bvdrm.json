Say hello to Spring with a refreshed and radiant glow. Amethyst House's 50 minute Signature Energy Facial engages the mind-body connection to provide a restorative and deeply relaxing experience ideal for pampering not only the soul but also the skin. If glowing skin is the result of optimal mental and physical health then mind body therapies seem like a no brainer when it comes to finding a solution to achieving this desirable state. Beauty products are often the go-to when seeking the fountain of youth and can help with signs of aging, but many have undesirable ingredients or do not go far in helping change the mental state of the person applying them. This is where Amethyst House comes in. Within the walls of this peaceful cottage sanctuary, the energetic, calming qualities of Reiki combine with the vibrational benefits of Sound and Crystal therapy as well as the beautiful aromas and healing qualities of Aromatherapy, to form the ultimate service in relaxation and beauty. But what exactly are these therapies and how do they help the skin? Long known as an effective technique to relax and de-stress the body, Reiki is alone an incredible modality for producing results when it comes to revitalizing the skin. After sessions people often find they have the \"Reiki glow\" that is produced as energy flows more freely through the body and its natural healing process is activated. As the body and mind relax, inner radiance begins to shine. As tension is released, the body's muscles relax including back, jaw and facial muscles improving circulation and blood flow as well as releasing stress and providing an overall state of wellbeing, all of which, not unlike beauty sleep, reflect in the skin. Amethyst House's special sound protocol uses the gentle vibration of tuning forks to promote greater relaxation, lymph movement, relieve facial tension, increase muscle tone and smooth skin. One simply relaxes as the calming sounds and vibrations play to tune the body and release energetic blockages or dissonance. Specially tuned forks resonate to bring the body and its nervous system into harmony. Forks placed on pressure points and on targeted areas such as the jowls or those with wrinkles all add to the healing benefits. Tuning forks also work with fascia (a web of connective tissue that runs throughout our bodies, holding in place organs, muscle, blood vessels etc.) that now is believed to be a very important component of our makeup in terms of communication between our brain and the rest of the body. Our fascia can become dehydrated and tight, but protocols using tuning forks can prove very beneficial to releasing and reviving it. Fascia is made primarily of collagen (the stuff that keeps our skin from sagging) and as we age, it is more difficult for our bodies to produce enough. Keeping it healthy is essential to youthful skin. Another perk of vibrational sound therapy are what are called binaural beats. These can be created by instruments such as tuning forks and work to entrain the brain (alter brain states) to create deeper relaxation and produce physiological healing responses such as the release of nitric oxide (widely considered one of the most important molecules produced in the human body) which we can start producing less of in response to stress. Crystal therapy and Aromatherapy are also luxurious additions that support a healthy complexion. Crystals have been used in beauty rituals for thousands of years. The ancient Egyptians used them for an array of anti-aging protocols. Chinese culture began incorporating them thousands of years ago as well. They are beautiful, feel soothing on the skin and have colors and energies all their own that can aid one in feeling less stressed and finding a more revitalized complexion. They engage the mind, body and spirit to promote wellness and have their own special qualities. For instance, Rose Quartz and its association with the energy of the heart chakra, and its ability to promote compassion and self love or Aquamarine and its association with youthfulness and tranquility are two good examples of stones that are ideal for incorporating into a beauty regime. Placing them on the body can be a great way to harmonize with the stones. Crystal facial grids (applied in the Signature Beauty service) use a variety of crystals placed on the face in geometric patterns and are a luxurious, magical way to pamper yourself and experience the special qualities they can offer. Essential oils and Aromatherapy have also been used for thousands of years for healing and beauty purposes. When applied they can nourish the skin all while creating a sense of calm upon inhalation. Not only can they naturally provide benefits physically, but they can also make you feel beautiful, which can be just as important. For example, Rose is a wonderful moisturizer as well as a mood booster. A symbol of beauty and love it exudes self care that can be felt when applied or inhaled. Certain essential oils excel as beauty enhancers and is important to know how to work with them. Amethyst House's products and protocols have been created by a certified aromatherapist to make sure they are safe and effective. Aromatherapy products can be restoring, anti-inflammatory, improve skin texture and reduce signs of aging. The perfect accompaniment to any self care regime. After a Signature Energy Facial at Amethyst House you will want to return and each time you do your skin and spirit will benefit. A wonderful holistic alternative to more invasive cosmetic procedures, this service can not only make you look and feel great, but is also painless...A win-win! Come experience an hour of bliss that will benefit your whole being and have you leaving feeling refreshed, radiant and "}
