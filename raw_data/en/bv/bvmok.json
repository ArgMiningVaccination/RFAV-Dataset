Mobile applications are strategic, paper not so much Timeliness of data to information Paper takes 2-3 days on average to transform into data Mobile manifest is near real-time (minutes, not days) Quality of data to information Paper requires interpretation of driver's handwriting 5,000+ drivers across DFA Mobile is dependent upon a driver's typing skil ls, which is minimized to weight and temperature primarily Barcode scanning captures majority of the data elements Accuracy improves as drivers become acclimated to the application Sustainability Paper consumes natural resources - 1 million multiple-part manifests annually Mobile consumes electronic resources 5 WWhy mobile manifest? The intent is to implement a mobil e manifest application with the following attributes: Utilization of the applicat ion on a smartphone or tablet (Apple or Android) Integrates with DFA SAP Milk Marketing Solutions Continue to work with custome rs to enhance data sharing Design technically to a standard of reusable programs to accommodate the frequent change in technological capabilities Mobile manifest is a journey, not a big bang Requires coordination wi th each DFA customer Requires thorough tr aining for each driver Requires Subject Matter Experts (SME's) 6HHauler data collection 7To Start: Driver logs in and selects route. Truck ID, seals, wash tags, and other fields are as entered or scanned At the Farm: Farm information captured by scanning tank QR Code Weights captured Sample information entered by barcode Producer's location confirmedDelivery: As Hauler approaches scale an email is generated with PDF attachment of manifest Plant delivery Tanker QR Code Receiver will: Scan tanker QR codeScan Tanker Seals to verify Enters:Temperature Enter load notes/comments Accept Load: Signature 8 Why dispatch? The dispatch solution enables DFA, its customers and haulers to gain visibility into milk supply schedules and plant demand schedules Provides automated communications with haulers and plants through electronic notifications Mobile Manifest integrates with the dispatch tool Validates unique load numbers as they are entered Provides visibility to load locations and status 9 Implementation approach DFA's Mountain Area was the first to begin testing functionality of the mobile manifest and dispatch solutions Colorado fully transitioned to mobile manifest and dispatch in May 2019 Idaho and Utah implementation is currently in progress Other Areas are interested in utilizing these tools 10 Mountain Area project timeline 11Oct 2017Discovery Project preparation Business case Application evaluation Sep 2018Planning Develop DDC and DFA integration Executed Conference room pilot Customer and Hauler briefings May 2019Execution Implementation preparation Executed driver training Executed customer training Implemented in Colorado In Progress Utah and Idaho implementations Current success rate Since implementation, over 93% of Colorado manifests have been successfully uploaded into the DFA SAP system Manifests that contain errors are conveniently managed through an error screen Customers using the tool today have a high level of confidence and are pleased with the new processes 12Lowell T.

Hopefully immunity to it will confer immunity to most strains. A vaccine is made. Vaccine is tested for safety and efficacy. Vaccine is approved. Vaccine becomes available. 13 Challenges associated with this approach: Must handle bad bugs in the lab. Several years from idea to release of commercial vaccine. Cost to get approval: high Must hope that you started with a strain that will result in immunity to many strains. Must hope that the strain that you started with will continue to confer immunity to many strains. Influenza example. 14 A bit on how vaccines work: \"Modified Live\" vaccines: Bad bug is modified so that it does not cause disease. Vaccine (made of modified bad bug) is administered to animal. Vaccine (modified bad bug) multiplies / reproduces for a brief period -until immune system recognizes it as foreign, mounts an immune response, and eliminates it. Animal's immune system now has mem ory of the \"antigens\" of that bug and can eliminate the bug if / when it sees it again. 15 A bit on how vaccines work: \"Killed\" vaccines: Bad bug is killed but not destroyed. Typically, an adjuvant is added. Vaccine (made of killed bad bug) is administered to animal. Vaccine \"shows\" the immune system an example of the bad bug. Animal's immune system now has mem ory of the \"antigens\" of that bug and can eliminate the bug if / when it sees it again. 16 A bit on how viruses work: A virus is a bit of RNA or DNA inside a shell. A virus cannot replicate by itself. A virus gets into a host cell and the host cell's machinery is tricked into making copies of the virus. Thus some folks do not consider a virus to be \"alive\". 1116666666616666611116616616111161666611111116111111611111111666111166666611161111 17 How Sequivity works: A bad bug is isolated on a farm or at a diagnostic lab. Antigenic proteins from th e sample are sequenced. An email is sent to Sequiv ity HQ with the protein sequence. RNA coding for that protein se quence (i.e. the antigen) is inserted into a viral particle that has been made unable to replicate. 18 How Sequivity works: Viral particle (containing RNA coding for antigen) is administered to animal. Dendritic cell captures the viral particle and travels to lymph node. Dendritic cell's machinery translates the RNA coding for the antigen of interest into a protein - that is, the dendritic cell manufactures the antigen. Dendritic cell then presents the antigen to both B-cells and T-cells thus evoking an immune response. 19 Why Sequivity is cool / useful / better: Speed - 8 to 12 weeks No handling of dangerous pathogens Agile - can address \"this year's strain\" No adjuvant required Very safe Can update vaccine to protect against new strain 20 Sequivity: Questions? 21 Mastitis: Mastitis Five Point Plan ~1970: 1.
