The term \"vaccination\" (\"vacca\" is Latin for \"cow\") derives from this.History, cont. 1870's: Koch proved that infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms- anthrax 1860's-1880's: Louis Pasteur developed vaccines against cholera quite by accident - attenuation . Coined \"vaccine\" in honor of Jenner. Also made first anthrax and rabies vaccines.Vaccines do not prevent infection But... They can prevent diseaseTHE GOAL OF IMMUNIZATION: MEMORYPolio: another success story 1952: 58,000 Americans contract polio Salk: inactivated polio vaccine - 50th anniversary last year Sabin: live vaccine 1994: Western world \"free\" of polio Success leads to modification of recommendation Passive Cellular Immunity Transfer of NK cells or activated NK cells - LAK therapy Transfer of immune T cells - Tumor infiltrating lymphcytesLyme Disease 1998 Cholera toxin 1992 Hepatitis B 1986 Pertussis 1981 Hepatitis B 1981 Tetanus 1927 Diphtheria 1923 Pneumococcus 2000 Haemophilus influenzae b 1987 Typhoid fever Meningococcus 1982 Pneumococcus 1977 Tick-borne encephalitis 1990 Hepatitis A 1995 Japanese encephalitis 1992 Rabies 1980 Polio 1956 Influenza 1936 Pertussis 1914 Plague 1897 Cholera 1896 Typhoid Fever 1896 Adenovirus 1980 Rubella 1969 Mumps 1967 Measles 1963 Polio 1963 Smallpox 1800 Yellow Fever 1938 Tuberculosis 1927 Rabies 1880LIVE VACCINESLIVE 1995Traditional Vaccine ApproachesLive, Attenuated Mimic natural infection without disease Can be delivered at appropriate site Classically done by passaging virus in foreign host cells or by temperature Often work with one administration - develop good immunological memory and long-term protection. Major advantage in developing world Now can be done by deletion of virulence factors from the organismInactivated Vaccines Typically chemicaly inactivated - formaldehyde treated Advantages: Stable; safer than live refrigeration not reqd. Disadvantages: Weaker immune response; boosters reqd. Salk vs. Sabin polio vaccines - Why the switch? Reversion 1:2.4 million; may spread through water systemToxoid Vaccines Disease is caused by a toxin released by the organism Give chemically modified toxin - \"toxoid\" E.g. tetanus, diptheriaConjugate Vaccines - H. Flu Haemophilus influenzae - Infection problematic in young children - Antibody to capsular polysaccharides is protective- Young children respond poorly to polysaccharide vaccines (T independent response weak; poor memory) - Creation of polysaccha ride-toxin conjugate enables child to respond H flu polysaccharides conjugated with tetanus toxoid, known to induce strong in childrenFigure 6-37 Multi-valent subunit vaccineLIPOSOME or ISCOMS: DELIVER CYTOPLASMVACCINIA VIRUS VECTORSDangers of Vaccination Current recommendation: Salk Flu also AcellularHow do we know if someone is immune? Check for antibody - just knowing the individual is immunized isn't enough - IgG vs. IgM - titer Measure T cell proliferation to antigen Measure CTL responses Skin test - e.g. PPD Boosters: stimulate memory cells, raise affinity, raise Ab titerDoes Immune Response = Immunity? Not Necessarily! - E.g. HIV-1 initially induces a good antibody response, but it is not protective - HIV-1 vaccines that induce antibody haven't been protectiveWhy do I need a flu vaccine every year? Antigenic shift and antigenic drift: virus escapes immune response Short incubation time (2 days) - No time to activate memory cells - No time to boost antibody levels- Existing antibody might not be protective anywayWhat about the \"Novel flu\"? \"Novel flu\" (AKA H1N1, swine flu) Nearing pandemic levels - what does this mean? Has genes from two swine flu viruses, common human flu and bird flu Arising by..... (fill in the blank) Last seen at pandemic levels in 1957 - seems less deadly than expected in older individuals, suggesting memory is helpful Young individuals more affected? - Unclear if this is holding up - \"Cytokine storm\" resulting in too robusts an immune response? - Some immunity in older individuals Sensitive to antivirals (e.g. Tamiflu) Vaccine?Synopsis (from http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/update.htm) : During week 18 (May 3 - 9, 2009), influenza activity remained at appr oximately the same level as last week in the United States, indicating that there are higher levels of influenza-like illness than is normal for this time of year. One thousand four hundred fifty-four (11.9%) specimens tested by U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating labor atories and reported to CDC/Influenza Division were positive for influenza.The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was below the epidemic threshold.Three influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported.The proportion of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) was above the national baseline. Three of the ten surveilla nce regions reported ILI above their region-specific baselines. Eight states reported geographically widespread influenza activity, 14 states reported regional activity, the District of Colum bia and 15 states reported local influenza activity; and 13 states reported sporadic influenza activity. Overall: 4,714 confirmed cases in US, 4 deaths. 14 in New Jersey During a normal flu season, up to 20 % of Americans are infected and up to 36,000 die.What's New..... Flumist - live influenza vaccine, cold attenuated Papilloma virus vaccine - cervical cancer Viral vectors - e.g. canarypox DNA vaccines - stable at room temp. DC vaccines - let the DC choose the epitopes - tumors (melanoma, others), infectious diseaseWhat's Needed? Effective vaccines for HIV, HSV, EBV, malaria etc. Better compliance - e.g. measles - Can it be eradicated? Better adjuvants for human use - Adjuvants increase magnitude and duration of response - stimulate expression of co-stimulatory molecules - Most current vaccines induce Th2 responses Asthma connection - Need adjuvants that will favor Th1, costimulation Inclusion of cytokine, plasmid DNA (CpG)What's needed (cont.) Safer vaccines More effective vaccines Cheaper vaccines - fewer whole organisms? Stable vaccines - no refrigeration - DNA vaccinesCan we eradicate more diseases by vaccination? Smallpox vs. measles - Smallpox eradicated; goal to eradicate measles by 2010, but it's still a major killer in 3rd world - Relatively low infectivity vs. higher infectivity. Herd immunity: the number of people needed to give immunity to population depends on the infectivity of the virus and the rate of vaccine \"takes\"; for measles, this required rate is much higher than for smallpox - Man is only host for both (no animal reservoir); no latency - Immunity lifelong to both but measles requires two doses - Compliance: Timing and dosing; Should vaccination be a choice?Other Vaccine Strategies Therapeutic vaccination- enhance host immune response against existing cells - Tumor vaccines: enhance immunity to existing tumors. - Therapeutic vaccination in infectious disease - turn on or switch to more protective immunity H I V ?Challenges to Developing an HIV Vaccine Surface Glycosylation Confirmational epitopes Latency/Integration Reservoir sitesWhy we need a vaccine against HIV Source: World Health Organization and Join t United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 2006 ReportPercentage of population in need receiving antiretroviral therapyWorldwide variation of HIVgp120 Subunit Vaccination Ineffective February 24, 2003 LARGE TRIAL FINDS AIDS VACCINE FAILS TO STOP INFECTION By ANDREW POLLACK WITH LAWRENCE K.
