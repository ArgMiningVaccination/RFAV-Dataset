Biological diversity, biodiversity, is the term ref erring to the entire biological world on earth, including genes, species, populations, commu nities and ecosystems, and all the components, of which it is composed, constitute the life-sustaining system on earth and lay a foundation for the sustainable development of the e conomy. It has been formed through as long history as 4 bil lion years since the birth of living things on earth. The increase in population, rapid development of ec onomy and extensive consumption of natural resources have seriously damaged the biodiv ersity which forms the foundation of the survival of mankind and the economic development. It was the urgency of the conservation and sustaina ble use of biodiversity and its components for the present and future generations t hat led to the adoption of the Convention on Biological Diversity at Rio Summit in 1992. During the last decade of the 20 th century since its adoption and even at the dawn of the new millennium, the biodiversity has been, however, still menaced seriously with the destruction of ecosystems, environmental deteriorat ion, loss of wild animals and plants as well as their habitats due to regional disputes, po verty and unsustainable consumption of natural resources in developed countries, despite t he active efforts of international community for conserving biodiversity. In order to meet its own commitment as a party to t he CBD, the DPR Korea made two rounds of increases in number and acreage of nature protected areas according to Article 8 of the Convention since the Rio Summit. At present, the acreage of nature protected areas r eaches 7.27% of the territory of DPRK. While integrating biodiversity conservation into th e Master plan for Land Development, the DPR Korea set the General Mobilization Period f or Land Development for each month in spring and autumn since 1996, and has pushed forwar d it as an all-people campaign. Biodiversity in DPR Korea suffered serious damages due to the massive exploitation of natural resources during the Japanese colonial rule protracted for about half a century and the indiscriminate bombing during the Fatherland Libera tion War (1950-1953). Since then, the rehabilitation of the land and natu ral environment has been promoted National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 5 according to several national measures, resulting i n the considerable recovery of destructed land and nature. However, the intensified economic sanction and seve re natural disasters continued for several years led to the over-exploitation of fores t resources for firewood, the deforestation of not a few mountains and hills due to the burnt-fiel d farming for food, and the considerable destruction of inland water ecosystem caused by the accumulation of mud and pebbles on rivers. With full understanding of the actual situation, th e great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il gave, on March 6, 2002, a vital teaching to make th e whole country as beautiful as a golden tapestry in the Workers' Party era by strongly prom oting the forest and water conservation, so as to take national measures to mobilize the entire party, the whole country and all the people to its implementation. At present, the Government of DPRK is closely combi ning the biodiversity conservation with the afforestation and gardening of the whole c ountry at country level, to promote the rehabilitation of degraded forests and the transfor mation of the whole territory into a golden tapestry in the Workers' Party era in conformity wi th the requirements of the new century. In this context, there was a need of updating the s trategies and action plans on biodiversity in DPR Korea, as required by developin g situations. In accordance with Article 6 of the Convention, the first \"National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan\" was prepared in 1998, with its foc us on followings: - Establishing the protected area network system involving areas of key importance in the biodiversity conservation and improving its management; - Recovering ecosystems damaged by natural disasters and implementing the biodiversity conservation plan in close combination with the land use plan; - Increasing actively bio-resources and establish the system for their sustainable use; - Reinforcing laws and regulations on biodiversity conservation; - Intensifying the scientific research on biodiversity conservati on; - Promoting the training for experts and officials on biodiver sity, etc. Based on the review and assessment of national prog resses in the implementation of the convention for the last decade, the updated NBSAP m entions the issues to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the convention in the field of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use within the coming decade at lea st, in consideration of the decisions adopted at the meetings (4th ~8th ) of the Conference of Parties (COP) to the CBD. It also keeps some issues, though not achieved in t he last decade, for new possible progresses likely to be made through its further pr omotion. Chapter 1 of the updated NBSAP gives an outline of the status of biodiversity in DPR Korea in all aspects of ecosystem, species and gene tic diversity and describes the features of National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 6 biodiversity in the country, the threats to biodive rsity and their reasons, and the needs and urgencies of biodiversity conservation. Chapter 2 evaluates the conservation and sustainabl e use of biodiversity in DPR Korea from the aspects of in-situ and ex-situ conservation, sustainable use of biodiversity components and their identification and monitoring. Chapter 3 includes the detailed description of cros s-cutting measures including legislation, institution, scientific research, communication, ed ucation and incentives, and also does the creation of models based on the ecosystem approach and the international cooperation. Chapter 4 provides the strategy for biodiversity co nservation in DPR Korea in the aspects of conservation, sustainable use, benefit-sharing a nd cross-cutting measures, while taking the original one into account. Chapter 5 includes priority projects and action pla ns in biodiversity conservation and sustainable use. The updated version of the NBSAP reflects the urgen t need to further develop the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in DPRK to meet the new century's demands. It will be a milestone for further successful imple mentation of the CBD in DPR Korea, making an active contribution, via its implementati on, to the conservation of biodiversity at country, regional and global levels. 2007. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 7 Introduction Geographical background DPR Korea is a peninsula located in the east of the Asian continent. It is flanked to the east and west by the Korean Ea st Sea (KES) and the Korean West Sea (KWS), and bordered on the north by China and Russi a across the River Amnok and the River Tumen. Korea has a typical temperate climate with the aver age annual temperature of around 8 ~12 , which has a considerable variation from region to region and from season to season. The average annual precipitation is 1,000 ~ 1,200mm . Dry season is from April to May and the rainfall du ring the rainy season from June to August is over the half of the annual precipitation . Mountainous areas take almost 80% of the whole terr itory and the climate in DPR Korea is influenced by such topographical conditions. With many mountains and rivers, the topography of D PR Korea is characterized by deep valleys and steep slopes. The territory is divided into 15 large catchment ar eas clearly demarcated and the rivers have fairly large outflows for its size. DPR Korea has very diverse phases and distinct hori zontal/vertical zonal characteristics of soil, which can be divided into 12 types, for it s size as large as 122,762km2. The vegetation zone can be divided into 3 types: su barctic coniferous forest zone (including polar plant zone in the alpine zone) and middle and southern temperate forest zones of coniferous and broadleaved (latifoliate) t rees. In DPRK, there are more than 100 natural lakes and 1,700 artificial ones or reservoirs. The water area including lakes, reservoirs and rive rs covers about 6% of the territory. It has long coastline and about 340 islands. The se as are occupied mostly by the continental shelf and in particular the KWS complet ely. The surrounding seas are strongly affected by the P acific Ocean via several straits. There appears the wide tideland due to high tidal r ange in the KWS, which is greatly different from the KES in its oceanographic feature s. During the 4 th (Quaternary) glacial period, DPR Korea had not been directly influenced by glacier in most areas except some mountain areas , thus preserving \"living fossils\" of the Mesozoic era and the 3rd (Tertiary) glacial period to a considerable extent . And during the glacial and interglacial periods, there had been nu merous migrations of northern and southern animals and plants. Since then, animal/plant species settled in the Kor ean peninsula had gradually adapted to the complex physiographical conditions and evolved into new species and/or varieties, National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 8 resulting in the enriched biodiversity. Physiographical conditions of the Korean peninsula with changeable climate, topographical complexity, ramified river network, n umerous lakes, long coastline and vast territorial waters provide various habitats for the existing fauna and flora. And that is why DPR Korea has rich diversity of fauna and flora and takes a high place in number of species per area among the northeast Asian countries. Objectives of updating the NBSAP At the meetings of COP to CBD since the preparation of National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan of DPRK with support from GEF and U NDP, important decisions and recommendations have been adopted on 2010 Biodivers ity Target, Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, Ecosystem Approach and thematic progr ammes of works related to the forest biodiversity, inland water biodiversity, coastal an d marine biodiversity and agricultural biodiversity. The 2010 Biodiversity Target stresses 4 strategic p roblems related to: Mainstreaming the Convention in international processes related to biodiversity; Improving financial, human, technical and technological capa city of the parties; Role of the NBSAP as an effective framework to implemen t the Convention; Raising public awareness and understanding of the signific ance of biodiversity and the Convention, to make broader participation acros s society in its implementation. And the 8 th meeting of COP stressed the importance of communic ation, education and information exchange relevant to biodiversity. Since the publication of NBSAP in 1998, DPR Korea h as been still faced with challenges such as the decrease in forest resources, deteriora tion of eco-environment and unsustainable use of natural resources caused by the adverse econ omic conditions. For implementing the CBD, DPR Korea has taken state measures to expand protected areas, improve the basin management and develop agr icultural production, and during the period, established the national framework for bio- safety. The Government of DPR Korea updated the NBSAP with support from UNEP, aimed at assessing progresses made in the past decade and fu rther promoting the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in accordance with the requirement for the sustainable development in the new millennium. Relations between the NBSAP and sectoral plans of n ational economy The NBSAP of DPR Korea is closely relevant to natio nal economic plans of several sectors, inter alia forestry, fishery, Koryo medicine manufacturing an d agriculture with major National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 9 relation to the use of natural resources, and also to the scientific research development plan, energy development plan and Master Plan for Land De velopment, as already mentioned in the former version. In the past decade, the implementation of the NBSAP has been promoted in close relation with the Master Plan for Land Development (MPLD). T he general mobilization for land development in both spring and autumn every year fr om 1996, as an all-people campaign, has played a significant role in the land management an d biodiversity conservation. In the fields of forestry, fishery and Koryo medici ne manufacturing, programs were or are being prepared and now undertaken to establish the systems and processes for the conservation and sustainable use of ecological envi ronment, mainly focused on the creation of resources. In particular in fishery, there was a fi rm conversion from catching fishery into cultivating one with great emphasis on the conserva tion of coastal ecosystem. In the scientific research work on biodiversity con servation, considerable progresses have been made during the period of 5-Year Plan for Scie nce & Technology Development (2003- 2007), on the basis of which the following 5-Year p lan (2008-2012) is being prepared with great efforts on the research and technological dev elopment for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. At present in the field of education, the action pl an is under preparation to improve the education on biodiversity and environment. Relations of the NBSAP with other international con ventions The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is one of the 3 major conventions related to the global environment along with the FCCC and C CD. DPR Korea is one of the parties to the 3 above-mentioned conventions. In recent years, international efforts have been ma de for preventing global warming. At the UN Inter-governmental Group Meeting on Clima te Change in 2007, it was suggested that over 90 % of major reasons of sudden rise in atmospheric temperature has origin in manmade greenhouse gases from the middle of the 20 th century, and that the increased consumption of fossil fuel caused the glo bal temperature rise in the last 50 years, which is two times higher than that in the former 1 00 years. It was also warned that, serious environmental disasters would be inevitable without any approach to the global warming. For preventing the global warming, it is urgent to: Decrease the greenhouse gas discharge by 6 % of that in 199 0 until 2012 and then implement the Kyoto Protocol; Increase the proportion and effect of renewable energy cons umption such as wind and solar energy, and bio-fuel; Enhance the ecological service function of forest storing CO 2. The improvement of biodiversity and ecological serv ices of forest ecosystem is also National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 10 closely related to the implementation of the CCD. In DPR Korea, the National Capacity Needs Self-Asse ssment (NCSA) project for the implementation of 3 major conventions on environmen tal management had been undertaken under the support from GEF and UNEP from July, 2004 to December, 2005. The report on the NCSA project analysed the cross-c utting issues of 3 major agreements which constraints capacity, and identified prioriti es for capacity building as follows: Simultaneous implementation of the build-up and man agement of forest resources and the introduction of renewable energy in rural a reas; Monitoring network system for observing biodiversit y components and land status; Regular updating of national inventory development system and the inventory of greenhouse gases; Development of technologies for organic farming and eco-farming and their application; Identification of criteria, indicator and method fo r EIA; International cooperation and exchange for the impl ementation of Rio Convention in training, technical transfer, information exchange and planning. In its strategy for capacity building, it also sugg ested 6 following targets to implement the conventions: Establishment of effective institutional system for implementing the Rio Convention; Development of information system for environment m anagement; Development of the operating methods and means; Intensification of the transfer and development of technologies for environment management; Strengthening environmental education and the human resources exploitation; Raising the public awareness on environmental issue s. Process of updating of the NBSAP in DPR Korea Updating of the NBSAP of DPR Korea was conducted by the State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) with the support from UNEP from December, 20 06 to September, 2007. During the project, main emphasis had been put on t he taxonomic need, protected areas, alien species, traditional knowledge, sharing of be nefits from gene resources, conservation of agricultural biodiversity, etc. There had been several rounds of meetings, consulta tions and technical workshops on the updating of NBSAP. Authorized by the NCCE of DPR Korea, the State Acad emy of Sciences organized the 1 st consultation to update the NBSAP on December 3, 200 5. Agreement on the organization of the expert group w as made at the consultation, which was participated by many agencies and stakeholders related to biodiversity conservation and National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 11 sustainable use, including: /circle2 State Academy of Sciences (SAOS); /circle2 Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP); /circle2 Ministry of Forestry (MOFr); /circle2 Ministry of Fishery (MOF); /circle2 Ministry of Education /circle2 Ministry of ( inter alia of Koryo Medicine); /circle2 Ministry (MOC) inter alia Cultural Relics Conservation Administration); /circle2 Mt. Daesong Management Bureau, etc. During the period from Jan.30 to Feb.2, the expert group made an in-depth discussion about the content of updated NBSAP and ways of acce ss to and analysis of information by items and allotted responsibilities according to ea ch items. Based on information collected by the expert group, the NCCE arranged the national workshop on updating of NBSAP in Sep.20-21, 2006. The workshop, participated by 10 relevant agencies including SAOS, MOFr, MOF, MOPH, discussed specific approaches to NBSAP. The NCCE authorized the expert group to prepare the draft of updated NBSAP until February, 2007, arranged a review on NBSAP updated in March, 2007 and allowed to complete the preparation until June, 2007. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 12 Chapter 1 Status of biodiversity in DPR Korea 1.1 Outline 1.1.1 Ecosystem Diversity The CBD defines the ecosystem as a dynamic complex of plants, animals, and micro- organisms and also non-biotic environment interacti ng as a functional unit with them. The ecosystem diversity could be considered one of the major components of biodiversity, the conservation of which leads the biodiversity co nservation. Special attention in conservation of ecosystem dive rsity should be paid to conserving properly and improving the service function of ecos ystem. Generally, natural ecosystems in DPR Korea can be c ategorized into 4 types; forest ecosystem, agricultural ecosystem, inland water eco system and coastal and marine ecosystem. 1.1.1.1 Forest ecosystem The forest ecosystem holds an important place in th e conservation of biodiversity in DPR Korea, where the forest land covers about 73% of th e territory. Forests in DPR Korea belong to the Northern Tempera te Zone forest, which are divided into 3 types; coniferous forest, broadleaved forest and coniferous-broadleaved mixed forest. 1) Coniferous forest About 41% of forests in DPRK are covered by the con iferous forest, the representatives of which are jezoensis forest is a typical subarctic coniferous forest , and the main tree nephrolepis, Picea jezoensis (spruce), P.koraiensis, etc . It is distributed in the areas 700-1,800m hi gh, including Paektu Plateau and Kaema Plateau. It takes about 14.5% of coniferous f orests. - Larch (Larix olgensis) forest The larch forest, a typical subarctic coniferous on e, is distributed mainly in alpine regions 1,000~1,900m high in Ryanggang Province and south a nd north Hamgyong provinces, the representatives of which are Larix olgensis var, Koreana and Larix olgensis . It forms single or mixed forests, and takes conside rable proportion of coniferous forests. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 13 - Pinus koreaiensis forest It is distributed in very wide area covering all ov er the country except some areas in Paekmu and Kaema plateaus. It is native to our coun try. Its distribution stretches to the areas 1,200m high in Ryanggang Province and Jagang Province, and intensively in the area around Mt. Og a. - Pinus densiflora forest It consists of Pinus densiflora , and is added with the artificial forest of P.rigida and the natural one of P.thunbergii in some areas. It is distributed in most areas except the northern uplands below the altitude of 1,000m. The productivity of the forest, the 2 nd one, differs greatly from area to area. 2) Broadleaved forest By the climate zone and biological characteristics, it can be categorized into subarctic, temperate and subtropical deciduous broadleaved for ests. The The temperate one consists mainly of oaks ( Querqus sp.), and is mixed with Tilia amurensis, Acer coreanum, Acer triflorum, Juglans m andshurica, pilosissima , Cyclobalanopsis vibrayana , oliv tree, etc. The broadleaved forest covers about 35.6% of the fo rest, and mostly consists of oak (approx. 52.4%). The oak forest is a forest communi ty mainly composed of Querqus mongolica, Q. dentata and Q. acutissima . The main type of oak forest is the Querqus mongolica forest distributed widely to areas with an altitude of 1,400m, so that the temperature broadleaved forest of our country might be regarded to be a community of Querqus mongolica. In addition to oak forest, the broadleaved forest i ncludes forests of Betula platyphylla (altitude 3) Coniferous and broadleaved mixed forests It can be classified according to climatic zone int o: - Subarctic evergreen mixed conif erous/broadleaved ones, Pinus National about 22% of the whole forest area. Main types of coniferous and broadleaved forests ar e : - Pinus densiflora-Quercus serrata forest, distributed in mountainous areas of north a nd south Hamgyong provinces, Kangwon Province, north a nd south provinces Koraiensis - Tilia of Pinus densiflora . DPR Korea is covered by mountain ad agricultural ec osystems but not any typical grassland ecosystem of large-scale. Originated from and surrounded by forests, grasslan ds, if any, is subject to the change into forest via natural processes without artificia l management. Therefore, grasslands in DPR Korea could be conside red as forest-type grassland ecosystem and their species are Miscanthus sinensis, a japonica, Artemisia montana and Senecio nemorensis. In DPR Korea, forest resources are distributed from the south to the north and from the lowland to the upland with clear features of horizo ntal zone and vertical zone. In particular, it is diverse in topography and rugg edness and bordered by seas on 3 sides, thus subject to oceanic climate. The isotherms are, therefore, U-typed, not parallel to latitude, so that the horizontal distribution limit of plant resources according to the climate zone is a bit upwards to the north in coastal areas of the Korean East Sea and Korean West Sea with clear verticality for many high mountain regions. Rich in acreage and stock of forest resources are, in general, uplands, northern areas in Ryanggang Province, Jagang Province and north and s outh Hamgyong Provinces. On the other hand, forests on lowlands in South Pyo ngan Province and north and south Hwanghae Provinces are very poor in forest stock fo r serious impact by human. Especially, the ones near populated areas are greatly degraded. As a result, heavy rains due to climate change caused serious soil erosion in mountains and failure in flood mitigation. In this context, it is urgent to recover the forest s degraded and also strengthen forest National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 15 conservation, to maintain and enhance the fertility of forest soil. In general, the more fertile the forest soil, the r icher diversity it may have; the lower fertile, the poorer it may have. In this aspect, as sessment should be conducted on biodiversity within forest ecosystem in DPR Korea. 1.1.1.2 Alpine ecosystem Alpine plant communities in DPR Korea are distribut ed like spots along high peaks over 2,000m high. The vegetation of alpine ecosystem is alpine meadow shrub forest distributed in peaks over 2,000m high, in an alpine zone, arctic floral zone. Such mountains with developed alpine plant communit ies are Mt. Rangrim (2186m). There are some 250 species of alpine plants of Arct ic origin in alpine floral zone, which is represented Pinus anentii and also includes 30 endemic and 50 medicinal plant species. Below the alpine plant communities, sub-alpine ones are distributed like spots on the peaks 1300-2000m high in north and south Pyongan pr ovinces, Jagang Province and Kangwon Province. The alpine ecosystem in DPR Korea is of great value as tourist resources for its particular scenic beauty. It is, however, subject to degradation, so it is an important object of conservation. The global warming brings about rapid changes in th e alpine ecosystems worldwide. The alpine ecosystem in DPR Korea is changing in sp ecies composition as well, and so requires more intensified research. 1.1.1.3 Inland water ecosystem. Rivers, lakes and reservoirs are important as habit ats for aquatic life, including fishes, and sources of industrial and agricultural waters. DPR Korea has well-developed drainage network with density of 0.4~0.6km/km 2. In general, rivers which empty into the KWS are lon g with well-developed tributaries and have wide catchment area compared to their length, while rivers into the KES are short with steep declivity. Vegetations in catchment area have functions of wat er catchment and soil protection. In management of catchment ecosystem, it is, theref ore, very important to ensure the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 16 stability of the ecosystem as much as possible by c losely combining the basic studies on its plant communities with the afforestation and manage ment of catchment area, and in particular, to promote the conservation of biodiversity by rest oring degraded forest and river ecosystems as soon as possible. Inland water ecosystems are of great significance i n conservation of endemic fish species and production of freshwater fish production, and a lso as a habitat for birds. So it is important to improve the management of inland water ecosystem subject to pollution and other human activities. In particular, crossing waters of fresh water and sea is of special significance for its rich biodiversity. On the whole, the conservation of biodiversity in t he inland water ecosystem should be integrated closely into the sustainable management of water basins. 1.1.1.4 Marine and coastal area ecosystems The KWS and KES are influenced by Pacific Ocean thr ough several straits. The Rivers Amnok, Chongchon and Taedong from DPR Ko rea and Rivers Yellow and Yangtze from China are flowing into the KWS, carryi ng enormous amount of deposits. The KWS has high tide (a maximum of 11.02m high). T he offshore of the KWS is known to have 250 species of fish. Average depth of the KWS is 39m, and therefore, it is important to protect the water environment of the K WS. The KES has long length (from north to south) over the width (from east to west). About 600 fish species are found to be in waters of DPRK of the KES. The KES has very favourable conditions for shallow- sea culture. The coast is estimated to have 546 species of seaweeds. Northern and south ern species of seaweeds intermingle at the east coast of the DPR Korea. The KWS has large area of tideland and many islands and islets. And in the seaside regions lie the major granaries. On the other hand, the KES is deep and has low tide, and most of its coastline is rocky except some estuaries. From these topographical differences, they have dif ferent biota from each other. Since the rise of sea level is predicted as a resul t of global warming, the investigation and research on changes in costal ecosystems of DPRK ar e suggested to be extremely important. In DPR Korea, wetlands are generally distributed in the coast. Of course, there are alpine wetlands in the marshla nds and peat lands of high mountain areas, but not so large. In particular, the tidelan ds along the whole coast of the KWS have rich biodiversity. The tideland plant communities are distributed alon g the west coast from Islands Bidan and Dasa at the estuary of River Amnok with its wid th of 300~500m at the mouth of the bay, and at the estuary of River Kumya in the east coast . Being related to the formation history of the KWS, the history of tideland vegetation is National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 17 not so long. Therefore, there is little different i n the composition and distribution of plant species. The major plant species are Salicornia europae , Suaeda japonica, S. glauca, of high bio-mass productivity. The tideland has diverse species of invertebrates w ith high distribution density. In particular, the tidelands in the coast of the KW S provide major habitats for shells of industrial value including clam worms and Metrix lamacki , main feeds for water-birds including snipes. The wetlands along the east and west coasts are imp ortant transit and wintering places for migratory birds in the northeast Asia. The main are as are: Dongrim ri, Mundok County, South Pyongan River Chongchon; Haejung ri, Kumya County, South Hamgyong Province at the of River Kumya; Da edong bay between Ryongyon, Taetan and Ongjin Counties, South Hwanghae Province; the 9 .18 Reservoir in Chongdan County, South Hwanghae Province; lake area in Rajin-Sonbong City, North Hamgyong Province. Wetlands along the shore of DPRK are placed on the flyway from the East Asia to Australia, one of 8 global flyways of migratory bir ds. In this context, coastal wetlands of DPR Korea, esp ecially in the estuaries and the coasts of Rivers Amnok, Chongchon, Daedong and Kumya are o f great regional/global significance. 1.1.2 Species diversity Species is a main part of biological evolution and the species diversity is the whole of all biological species and their transformation. Important in species diversity are to mitigate thre ats to species diversity and also to resolve mechanisms of its formation, evolution and conservation. DPR Korea, located in the northeast Asia, is charac terized by relatively diverse species of animals and plants thanks to its formation history and geographical location. Having taken a shape of peninsula in the northeaste rn region, the land of DPRK had been subjected to frequent changes from the strait to th e land or sea during the glacial and interglacial periods repeated 4 times, which had be en followed by migration of plants and animals from the continent and southern region. In this process, there had occurred the extension, retreat or separation of distribution of fauna/flora, enabling diverse species of plants/ani mals to inhabit and consequently leading to their differentiation into native species, survival of living fossils, etc. Also, it has made mountain topography complex, habi tat circumstance variable and rich fauna/flora maintained. 1.1.2.1 Plant In DPR Korea, about 10,000 plant species are record ed as of the late 2006, among which National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 18 the vascular plants are 3,623 species, spermatophyt es 3,364 species, bryophytes 781 species and lichens 583 species, respectively. In addition, about 2,300 species of fungi and 2,700 species of algae are known. Lower plants take the place of primary producer amo ng the components of ecosystem and are important for the conservation of terrestri al and marine ecosystem biodiversity. In DPR Korea it is anticipated that more species of lo wer plants will be found through intensified survey and research. 1.1.2.2 Animal Vertebrate animals recorded in DPR Korea by the end of 2006 are 1,435 species of 472 genera of 151 families. 1) Mammals Mammals are 107 species of 69 genera of 28 families , among which terrestrial ones are 79 species of 48 genera of 20 families, composed of 11 species of Insectivora , 24 of chiropter , 2 of Carnivora and 7 of Artiodactyla . The representatives of mammals are tiger, leopard, jackal, grey wolf, brown bear, bear, sable, common otter, deer, musk deer, water deer, r oe deer, goral and so on. 2) Birds 420 species of 190 genera of 61 families of birds h ave been recorded in DPR Korea, among which non-migrant, winter migrant, passing-by and stray birds have 64, 106, 83 and 73 species respectively. These figures show the hig h proportion of migratory birds among them. The migratory ones are represented by cranes, egret s, spoonbills, storks and swallows. 3) Amphibians and Reptiles Reptilians involve 26 represented by the Eumeces coreensis , Ancistrodon halys , mud turtle, bufo , Rana temporaria ornativentris, R. chosenica, R.coreana, etc. 4) Fishes Up to date, there have been records of 865 species of fishes including marine ones, which consist of 111 of freshwater, 59 of brackish and 15 of anadromous species, with lots of endemic freshwater species. 5) Invertebrate 8,360 species of invertebrate including about 5,970 species of insects have been recorded so far and its number is anticipated to increase 3~ 4 times as much as the current one via National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 19 ongoing detailed study. 1.1.2.3 Microorganisms In DPR Korea 1,005 species of 140 genera of microor ganisms were isolated from various ecological environments, and preserved, including t axonomical groups of bacteria (227 species of 50 genera), Actinomyces (316 species of 6 genera), yeasts (203 species of 35 genera) and molds (259 species of 49 genera). The investigation on the microorganisms in Mt. Paek tu area recorded 306 species of 43 genera, among which molds (113 species of 15 genera ) predominated, followed by yeast (81 species of 18 genera), Actinomyces (71 species of 2 genera) and bacteria (41 species of 8 genera). By the further intensified taxonomical research on microorganisms, increase in the number of species is anticipated and their regional characteristics will be revealed more clearly. 1.1.3 Genetic diversity Genetic diversity is one of main components of biod iversity, forming the basis of ecosystem diversity and also species improvement in cluding for crops, domestic animals, trees and fishes. All the genetic resources are originated from wild animals and plants adapted to physiographical/ecological conditions of relevant l ocal areas, and inter alia, wild relatives of cultivated plants and livestock. In the field of breeding, genes of wild species fin d active use to breed high-yield varieties resistant to diseases and pest, which provides econ omic benefits to a great deal. It is nature reserves that play a significant part in the conservation of genetic resources of wild plants/animals. Genetic resources of crop plants and domestic anima ls are of great significance, which have been selected, bred, cultivated and raised dur ing the long course of history. Our ancestors with a long history of over 50 centur ies have cultivated/raised various kinds of cops and domestic animals. Since 6000 years ago, they have cultivated rice, be ans, foxtail ), which are proved with many evidences in historic relics. Data shows that they cultivated rice, millets, foxt ail millet, sorghum and barley early in 1500-1000 B.C., and the Korean rice different from foreign ones was found in the Namgyong Relic of Honam ri, Samsok District, Pyongyang, a re lic of New Stone Age. At the centre of the site of an old building 36 in the relic, there were 5 kinds of cereals National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 20 including rice, bean, millet, foxtail millet and so rghum inside soil. The rice grains took the same type of short-grain a s the earliest rice from Japanese relics, proving that our ancestors did advanced rice farmin g and disseminated the rice farming techniques to inhabitants of neighbor areas includi ng Japan early at the period. Our ancestors have used abundant plant/animal resou rces as raw medicinal materials for traditional medicine from ancient times. They were the first in the world that used wild ins am ( Panax schinseng ) as a medicine, and established its cultivating method including ri ght place for its cultivation, to begin cultivating an insam (\" Bonchokangmok \", an outlook of medicinal plants , vol.16, 122p). Koryo Insam is now as famous in the world as ever. The Koryo age had encouraged to cultivate Rehmannia glutinosa (the \"History Koryo Dynasty\" vol.9, Segamunjong 33, July) and been famo us for matrimony vines of Is. Jindo. The Geography of \"Chronicles of the Sejong Dynasty\" (issued in the 15 th century) contains the names, distributions and varieties und er cultivation of 400 kinds of medicines to be taken and used in different areas, while the \"Ha ndbook of Korean Traditional Medicine\" (published in 1433) does 699. Many books related to medicine including \" Wuibangryuchi \" (1477), \" Tonguibogam \" (1611) and \" Dongwuisusebowon \" (1894) made contributions to disseminate the cult ivation of medicinal plats across the country. Now in the world, the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources are very important for developing all branches of economy in cluding agriculture, livestock and public health. In particular, continuing loss of biodiversity at g lobal level is addressing the conservation of genetic resources of countries and areas rich in biodiversity as a special priority related to livelihood of native/minority peoples (referred to 1st part of Chapter 2 on fair and equitable sharing of benefits from genetic resources). 1.1.3.1 Wildlife DPR Korea is relatively rich in wild plants and ani mals for its size. It has more than 900 species of medicinal plants, i ncluding Panax ginseng, Schizandra chinensis, Rheum coreanum Moschus moschiferus, Hydropotes inermis, Ra na temporaria ornativentris and so on. In addition, it has many species of crop-relatives like Glycine soja. 1.1.3.2 Cultivated plants Genetic diversity of cultivated plants is the valua ble component of biodiversity with great practical significance. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 21 At present, DPR Korea has about 55,840 kinds of pla nt genetic resources in total, among which cereal, vegetable and industrial crops are ab out 41,700, 10,900 and 3,240 kinds respectively. In particular, the cultivation of medicinal plants is being encouraged. 1.1.3.3 Domesticated animals DPR Korea has 57 breeds of 7 species of livestock ( including 8 cultivars of cattle, 8 of sheep, 11 of pig and 13 of rabbit), 31 breeds of 7 species of domestic fowl (including 8 breeds of chicken, 7 of duck and 6 of goose). In addition, it has 246 breeds of 3 species of silkworms and 3 breeds of honeybees. The breeding of medicinal animals is also promoted and in particular there are 45 stock- farms for deer and 1 for musk across the country. 1.1.3.4 Aquatic organisms Surrounded by seas on 3 sides and characterized by dense drainage network and lots of lakes and reservoirs, the DPR Korea is rich also in aquatic organism species. There are 185 species of freshwater fish and 59 of coastal bracki sh-water fish. Great efforts in the field of fishery are being rec ently made to rear marine animals like Haliotis gigantea and lobsters of high economic value and to cultiva te marine algae like Laminaria japonica , Undaria and laver. Considering the physiographical conditions of DPRK, the genetic diversity of aquatic ecosystem has a great significance in the economic development and improvement of people's livelihood through eco-environment preserv ation and fishery development. As for the conservation of genetic resources of our country, agricultural resources are administered by Institute of Crop Variety, Academy of Agricultural Science(AAS), livestock resources by Institute of Stockbreeding, microbiolo gical resources by Institute of Crop Variety and Institute of Fermentation, Branch Acade my of Light Industry, SAOS, forest resources by the Institute of Forest Breeding, Bran ch Academy of Forestry, SAOS, fishery resources by institutions under Branch Academy of F ishery, SAOS (including Institute of Fishery, Shore Institute and Institute of Fish Farm ing, and other resources by relevant institutions (ex. silkworms by Institute of Sericul ture, AAS, and bees by Institute of Bee, AAS). During the last half century, lots of varieties of crops, domestic animals high in yield and adapted to natural features of our country have bee n bred and introduced in several fields, with many strains of microbes developed and applied . For successful promotion of conservation and use of genetic resources, it is necessary to: - Strengthen and modernize the capacity of depositories for genetic resources , and National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 22 construct the databases and information system for genetic r esources obtained and preserved, so as to establish the regular informati on service system for producers from several fields of national economy; - Establish the new conservation system in undeveloped fields as soon as possible; - Study and develop many application aspects of genetic resources incl uding survey of resources, breeding of new varieties and production of bio-actives by advanced bio- technology, so as to make those resources effective ly available for improving people's livelihood; - Promote the survey and preservation of wild relatives and the conservation of local varieties. 1.2 Features of biodiversity in DPR Korea 1.2.1 Ecological and evolutionary features of biod iversity 1.2.1.1 Ecological and evolutionary features DPR Korea is not only rich in the number of plant/a nimal species for its size but also surpasses the neighboring countries in the rate of species per unit area, e.g. 3,943 species of higher plants with the rate of 0.03 species/km 2 and 420 of birds with 0.003 species/km 2. It is also characterized by the diverse composition of biological species. The territory of DPR Korea is a peninsula located i n the east of Asian continent that was not directly influenced during the tertiary glacial era. And also, northern species from Arctic, northeast China and Mongolia, southern species of t emperate and subtropical origin and cosmopolites from northeast Asia and Eurasian conti nent had migrated and distributed intensively during the glacial and interglacial era . And another reason is put to that the animal/plant species survived have developed into endemic species through evolutionary processes adap ting to the diverse physiographical conditions of the country after the glacial period. The main living plant fossils in the country are Magnolia sieboldii, jankowskii are the typical avian living fossils of Tertiary period, and Hydronotes inermis for mammalian ones. Among freshwater fishes, Gonoprokopterus mylodon and Microphysogobia koreensis are endemic fishes differentiated during the time when the KWS was the tributary of palaeo- Lota lota and Hucho ishikawai distributed in the northern highland are also the living fossils of Te rtiary period, related to the paleo-Amur hydrosphere. Fauna and flora of DPR Korea has special significan ce in view of the evolutionary National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 23 history of bio-species in northeast Asia. 1.2.1.2 Endemic species DPR Korea has endemic species of high rate in the t otal plant species. According to the proven data, there are 14 species of Pteridophyta (7 varieties), 3 species of gymnosperms (5 varieties, 1 forma), 198 species of angiosperms (197 varieties, 17 forma), totalling to 315, which account for 10% of total va scular plant species. There are 6 endemics (with single species and singl e of single genus: Keumkangsania asiatica and K. latisepala . There are many endemic species with high medicinal value such as Rheum coreanum and Astrogaalus setsureianus. As for endemic animals, the vertebrate is known to have 33 species/subspecies of fish, 3 of amphibian, 2 of reptile, 2 subspecies of bird an d 1 subspecies of mammal, which account for 2.9% of total vertebrate species. The reason of richness of DPRK in endemic species i s that the complex physiographical conditions and biological isolations in some areas had facilitated the formation of endemic species. That is, topographical conditions of DPRK with some 10 mountains over 2,000m high and high density of mountain ranges and valley s and their complicated intersection resulted in great differences of microclimate and e co-environmental conditions which have restrained the seed distribution and pollen exchang e of plants. It is expected that more endemic species in DPRK wi ll be discovered via the taxonomical research on lower plants and invertebrates to be de epened. 1.2.2 Diversity of economic species Most animals and plants distributed in DPRK have hi gh economic values. The number of plant species of economic value in re gard to use is given in table 1-1. In DPR Korea, there are: - Tree species of high value as a plants including walnut, Juglans cordiformis, b lack(wild) walnut, Pinus National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 24 koreaiensis and Evodia daniellii ; - species in DPRK by usage Usage Species Number Medicinal plant About 900 Wild edible grass 200 Wild fruits 30 Forage plant 160 Timber plant 100 Fiber plant 100 Oil plant 50 Aromatic plant 60 Melliferous plant 170 Garden plant 300 Sugar source plant 10 Total 2,080 As for wild forest animals with economic value, the re are thousands of ducks-wild gooses ( Anatidae ) migrate along the coastal plains and wetlands of the KWS and KES. In the inland waters there are 185 species of fresh water, brackish water and anadromous (or catadromous) fishes and in the coastal waters, innumerable seaweeds and invertebrates National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 25 with high industrial value such species of Rhodophyta , 130 species of Rhaeophyta, 87 species of Chlorophta and in total 546 species of seaweeds are known. Am ong them, 309 species of Algae including 63 species of high medicinal value have high economic values. Microorganism resources have high economic and envi ronmental values as well. The investigation on the microorganisms in the area of Mt. Paektu recorded 306 species of 43 genera, among which molds (113 species) predo minate. Over 2,310 species of fungi include 170 species of Myxomycetes , over 820 of parasitic species, 870 of mushroom and 290 of soil-fungi spec ies. And there are more than 2,700 species of Algae, including over 2,050 of microalga e. 1.2.3 Threatened species The 2010 Biodiversity Target, adopted as a decision (VI/26) of the meeting of Convention of Parties to the CBD, stresses the importance of i dentifying the change in status of threatened species for identifying the status of selected ecos ystems and habitats and the trends in abundance and distribution of selected species as w ell. The threatened plant species (seed plant) in DPR Ko rea account for about 4.54% of the total number of species thereof. Threatened plants can be classified, according to t he criteria of IUCN, into extinct (EX), critically endangered (CR), endangered (EN), vulner able (VU) and near threatened (NT) species as follows (Table 1-2). Table 1-2.

All of 5 above-mentioned factors give, though to di fferent extents, threats to biodiversity in DPRK as well In this context, the main factors of threats to bio diversity in DPRK are the overuse of natural resources, loss of habitats due to deforest ation and fragmentation and deterioration of environment. Of course, the invasive alien species and environmental pollution also exert influence to a certain extent. 1.3.1 Excessive use of natural resources The excessive use of natural resources over its rep roduction capacity causes depletion of natural resources and loss of biodiversity. The excessive use of natural resources is closely r elated to population increase. The DPR Korea is relatively high in population dens ity for its territory. The degradation of forest ecosystem is caused by ov eruse of forest resources, inter alia firewood due to acute rural energy problem accordin g to population increase. The degradation of forest ecosystem due to overuse of its resources causes the decrease in animal/plant resources. The overuse of fishery resources causes rapid fall in relevant species. In particular, the overuse of seaweeds leads to the loss of fishes. 1.3.2 Deforestation and loss of habitats National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 28 In DPR Korea with over 80% of its territory covered by mountains, the conservation of forest holds an important place in the biodiversity conservation. The increase of treeless areas caused by the excess ive use of forest resources deteriorates the ecological service of forest. In particular, th e denudation of sloping land gives rise to the loss of soil and water, and exerts subsequently gre at influence to water ecosystem. Tense food problem due to difficult economic deadlo ck in 90's of last century made sloping forests subjected to the transformation int o agricultural land, resulting in serious loss of biodiversity. Reckless deforestation followed by its fragmentation causes loss of habitats for wild animals and plants. It is large-sized animals like Urus tibetanus that are most impacted by the fragmentation of habitats. Fragmentation of habitats for Lutra lutra due to change in rivers and streams caused rapid decrease in its population. Loss of wetlands is a t hreat to global threatened species including Grus japonensis and G. vipio , and not a few waterfowls. The 2010 Biodiversity Target stresses the importanc e of mitigating the destruction of ecosystems and habitats, and of reducing the rate o f loss of species, community and genetic diversity. Important for the conservation of ecosystem and hab itats in DPRK are; - to promote the conservation of forest biodiversity by blocking the destruction of forest ecosystem and actively recovering the degraded ones , taking into account the mountainous land covering over 80% of the territory , - to make great efforts to conserve the coastal ecosy stem with its focus on wetlands, main habitats for migratory birds in view of penins ula-shaped territory, and - to strengthen the conservation of agricultural biod iversity within rural areas covering about 17% of the territory in the consideration of regional characters. 1.3.3 Environmental deterioration The loss of water and soil and the accumulation of sands and pebbles in rivers, lakes and reservoirs due to the destruction of forest, follow ed by increase in flood damage cause serious losses not only to the economic development but als o to habitats for animals and plants, thus leading to loss of biodiversity. The main problem in environmental deterioration is the water pollution due to massive waste waters from industry and populated areas, whi ch causes a serious decrease in self- purification function of the lakes and reservoirs t hemselves and eutrophication and consequently damage to human health and loss of bio diversity in inland water ecosystem as well. In shallow-sea-culture also cause, excess of its pu rification capacity would cause the appearance of red water due to extra nitrogen and p hosphor to be followed by serious National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 29 damages to the culture. The acid rain due to air pollution damages forests, and also acidifies lakes and reservoirs, to threaten survival of aquatic biomes. The prevention of the environmental deterioration i n DPRK is linked to the prevention of flood damages due to the frequent heavy rains that is caused by abnormal weather due to the climate change. In this context, it is necessary to take measures to block the vicious cycle of ecosystem and mitigate damages from natural disaste rs by actively promoting the afforestation and gardening of the whole country to recover the degraded forests as soon as possible. And it is also important to assess the comprehensiv e impacts of introduction of alien species on loss of biodiversity to conserve biodive rsity inherent in DPR Korea. 1.4 The necessity and urgency of biodiversity cons ervation 1.4.1 Necessity Biodiversity forms the most important material base of humanity's subsistence and development. Prospective economic development, impr ovement of life environment, material and cultural life are closely related to various human activities of using biological resources in the economic fields like forestry, agriculture, fishery , etc. The CBD defines the biological resources to include genetic resources, organisms or parts thereof, populations, or any other biotic com ponents of ecosystems with actual or potential use or value for humanity. Overuse of biological resources, beyond its reprodu ctive ability, for immediate benefits would lead to the exhaustion of biological resource s and irreparable destruction of habitats. Hence, the conservation of biodiversity, removal of the factors of threats to biodiversity and promotion of the sustainable use of biodiversit y components, in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals, are literally the mor al duty of the present generation for the next generations. In this regard, it is still necessary to increase p ublic understanding and appreciation of the direct economic benefits from and indirect and logi cal value of biodiversity and to enhance the institutional, human, technical and technologic al capacity for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. 1.4.2 Urgency Following issues are urgently requesting DPR Korea to take new innovative measures for the conservation of biodiversity: - Excessive exploitation of forest resource for firew ood and timber; National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 30 - Loss of forest land due to reclamation and infrastr ucture construction; - Destruction of forest due to excessive grazing; - Erosion and degradation of soil, decrease of water resources, loss of forest biodiversity and the adverse impact on inland water biodiversity ; - Loss and fragmentation of habitats attributable to unsustainable management of ecosystem. The Government of DPRK has conducted several activi ties to support the implementation of the CBD adopted at Rio Summit in 1992, but the o bstacles by economic blockade, in particular energy deficiencies, exert adverse impac t on the biodiversity conservation as well. In this context, it is important to actively develo p and use renewable energies, to halt land degradation and to convert agriculture into sustain able one, to integrate the biodiversity conservation into the sustainable development of lo cal economy with respect to local features and to raise the ecosystem services, so as to impro ve eco-environment fundamentally. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 31 Chapter 2 Assessment of Conservation of Biodiversity and Its Sustainable Use in DPR Korea 2.1 In-situ Conservation DPRK has taken a series of measures for the in-situ conservation, including expanding of the nature protected areas. 2.1.1 Protected Areas For conservation of the habitats, it is important t o expand the protected areas and establish framework of their management and net to manage them on scientific line and establish the monitoring system for conservation of biological diversity in the protected areas, and to increase the whole biological resources in t he protected areas and to sustainably use them. 2.1.1.1 Designation of Protected area Since DPRK has signed to CBD in 1995, the governmen t made national measure to expand protected areas to 696,927 ha, 5.68% of the territory. In addition, the government took measure to expand to 879,275 ha, 7.2% of the territory. The nature protected areas were expanded to 7.2% of the territory according to types of the protected areas(Table 2-1). Table 2-1.

Successful progresses in this work will lead to fol low the decision of the 7 th COP to the CBD on the effective conservation of at least 10% o f every ecological areas of the world. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 34 The protected areas of DPRK, at present, help to es tablish framework for conservation of 50 percent of the most important areas in plant divers ity conservation as one of the Global Strategy of Plant Conservation, which was suggested in the 6th COP. Followings are status of the protected areas in DPR K according to types: Strict Nature Reserves In strict nature reserves, designated at some areas of natural regions in the original state of natural forests and primary forests, all activit ies of destroying nature are strictly prohibited. They involve the areas with alpine and sub-alpine v egetations, with typical natural forests, spectacular landscapes and special topographical, g eographical and natural phenomena and with congested habitats of threatened plants and an imals. Strict Nature Reserves in DPRK cover 88,159ha inclu ding the core areas of the Mts. Paektu and Kuwol Biosphere Reserves and other 6 are as of Mts. Oga, Kwanmo, etc. Further measures are necessary to establish specifi c monitoring system for thorough isolation and improve its management. Nature parks At present, many nature parks including at Mts. Kum gang, Myohyang and Chilbo, have been designated as the nature protected area, which account for 3.2% of the territory. It will be necessary to investigate and monitor eco systems and wildlife and to prepare management plans and detailed measures for nature p arks, and especially to intensify the public awareness, propagandas and dissemination of value of biodiversity via the nature parks. Habitat reserves Every wildlife species are the component of ecosyst em as the essential element of biodiversity conservation. The reduction of wildlife, inter alia the extinction of threatened species is a global i ssue. In DPR Korea, the priority areas in conservation of wildlife, especially threatened species, are designated as animal/plant reserves. At present there are 25 animal reserves (58,973.4ha ) and 25 plant ones (25,698.2ha) in the country. In particular, in view of its situation in the East Asia-Australia flyway, one of 8 global flyways, the DPRK has designated 12 wetlands (about 10,000ha) as migratory bird(wetland) reserves including the estuary of Chongchon River i n Mundok County, South Pyongan Province, tideland around the 9.18 Reservoir (South Hwanghae Province), etc. These migratory bird reserves aim to mainly protect the global threatened species, cranes, Platalea minor, Anser cygnoides , Anas formosa and so on. Natural monument reserves National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 35 The DPRK designated the precious scientific natural entities with rich biodiversity and related to the formation of proper national culture as the living monument, which is being protected. The designated areas as the living monument play si gnificant roles in conservation of ecosystems and species in our country. Regular survey, preparation of preservation plans a nd management of protected areas are processing for the protection of natural monuments. Resource reserves Resource reserves of DPRK, established for the cons ervation of forest, inland and coastal water resources, includes 26 aquatic resource reser ves (11 for inland and 15 for coastal waters totaling 50,690ha), 4 plant resource reserves (6,65 9ha) and the buffer zones around biosphere reserves in Mts. Paektu and Kuwol, covering 96,588. 6ha in total. For the fishery resource reserves, some measures ar e taken to protect water environment, such as the preparation of spawning ground and reso urce survey. 2.1.1.2 Various Kinds of Protected Forests In DPRK, various kinds of protected forests, except the nature protected areas, cover 343,200ha (2.8% of the territory), including hygien ic and scenic forests, protective forests for river banks, reservoirs and farmlands, and windbrea k forests. Various kinds of protected forests are significant in conservation of eco-environment, wildlife and genetic resources, and in the national conservation net of protected areas. 2.1.1.3 Problems for Designation of the Protected Areas It needs to provide the minimum area for the minimu m viable population (MVP) in conservation of biodiversity, especially preservati on of wildlife in the protected areas. As it is difficult to expand each protected area in our country, small in size of the territory and high in population density, it is necessary to designate buffer zones around protected areas and create the ecological corridors linking e ach other, while expanding each area as much as possible. In addition, it is indispensible to prepare and rei nforce the laws and regulations relevant to its conservation and management and rearrange th e institutional management systems for protected area. As several ministries and agencies such as the Mini stry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP), Ministry of Forestry (MOFr) and Cultural Relics Conservation Administration (CRCA) are now involved in protected area management, it is necessary to establish an independent institution in protected a reas and define the demarcation of its responsibilities and to ensure the liaison between agencies concerned. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 36 Moreover special attention should be paid to improv ing qualifications of officers. The settlement of management personnel is desirable in the areas where it is unreasonable to set up management institution. It is also important to do systematic investigation s on and to set up monitoring system for protected area, including: To conduct regular survey on resources and systemat ic research on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and on the pres ervation and multiplication of threatened species; To investigate economic and medicinal animals and p lants, and sustainable tourism; To make local power organs pay great attention to t he management of protected area and make the investigation results contribute to th e vitalization of local economy; To regularize the ecological monitoring and to prom ote the establishment of information system for protected area. In order to promote the education and communication via protected areas, public awareness and understanding of the importance and v alue of biodiversity should be increased through their visits to protected areas, and variou s types of media products (book, cahier, magazine and CD) should be manufactured based on th e data obtained from systematic investigation and research for the communication an d dissemination of the importance of biodiversity. For this purpose, the national investment for prote cted area construction and management should be increased to perfect the infrastructure o f protected areas for the integration of management, research, monitoring, education and com munication. 2.1.2 Management of the Protected Areas The protected areas in DPRK have been in charge by Ministry of Land and Environment Protection, Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Agric ulture, Revolutionary Facts Guidance Bureau, Cultural Relics Conservation Guidance Burea u. The institutions for conservation have been establi shed in the protected areas and scenic spots, including Mts. Paektu, Myohyang, Kumgang, Ch ilbo, Kuwol etc, to manage by expert managements. In addition, the protected areas are m anaged by the protectors from forest- management authorities. But the nature protected areas have no-arrangements of the management structure for preparation of the unified planning, collaboration between sectors and synthetic management to face the increasing protected areas, including s ome defects of the collaboration/coordination between central agencies and between central and local organs of power and lack capacity of the lowest managing unit s. It needs to retrain the personnel of the lowest man aging units, with factual measures, to encourage the active scientific research for improv ing the management of protected areas and National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 37 to reinforce the education and propaganda for publi c awareness, basing on results of the scientific research work. 2.1.3 National Legislations National laws related to the habitat conservation a re as follows: \"Law on Environment Protection\" (1986); \"Law on Forest\" on Environmental Impact Assessment\" (2006); In line with the proclamation of laws and regulatio ns on habitat conservation, national measures including regular explanations of law and regulation are being undertaken to raise public awareness and to establish the atmosphere of law observance. The units that are active and successful in observa nce and execution of laws and regulations are awarded the title of \"Model Law-abi ding County\" and the generalization of their examples is gaining more impetus. However, the laws that entirely deal with the conse rvation of protected area and wild plants are not formulated yet. In this context, it is important to recheck the exi sting laws and management regulations for protected areas and make them more detailed to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. 2.1.4 Scientific Research Notable successes have been achieved in the scienti fic research on protected areas during the past decade, for instance: Classification of the forest ecosystem of Mt. Paekt u Biosphere Reserve and their historic succession process (1995-2000); Assessment of and protection measure for the eco-en vironment of Mt. Paektu area (2000-2006); National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 38 Assessment of the diversity of plant/animal species and ecosystems at priority areas of the country (2003-2007); Protective biological study on major protected area s and on rare/threatened species of plant and animal (1999-2002). In addition, a data book, \"Protected Areas in DPR K orea\", was prepared in collaboration with UNESCO in 2005 and collective investigation wa s performed on Mt. Kuwol area which was registered as international biosphere reserve a fter the Mt. Paektu Biosphere Reserve. However, there are still many holes in the detailed investigation and research on protected areas in general. In the investigation and research on protected area s, it is important to closely combine investigation and research with management and to e stablish observation stations and monitoring spots at key protected areas to conduct regular investigation and monitoring. Necessary in the investigation and research on prot ected areas are as follows: Study on the structure and function of ecosystem, o n the population ecology, reasons of extinction, protection measures and artificial p ropagation of threatened species; Study on the targets and ways of, and environmental impact assessment on, resource exploitation and use, based on the investigation in protected areas; Study on the cooperation between the protected area management and local socio- economic development; For the protected area management, application stud ies are also needed on: Development of evaluation indicators and bases, sta ndards for ecological monitoring, database and information system, management styles; Establishment of ecological corridors outside prote cted areas; Functional classification of protected areas and th e ways how to ensure the satisfactory conservation and sustainable use of pr otected area in conformity with their features 2.1.5 Alien Species The Article 8 of the CBD stipulates that the alien species threaten to ecosystems, habitats and species should not be introduced and be eradica ted or controlled. The 2010 Biodiversity Target also stressed the cont rol of the threats from invasive alien species. As being high in dissemination ability, adaptabilit y to environment and viability, invasive alien species have high risk to cause genetic pollu tion, predation of and habitat concurrence with other species and ecosystem disturbance. Parti cularly, invasive alien species are threatening the ecosystems and species specific to the country and also causing large damage to agriculture, stockbreeding and forestry. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 39 At present, the border transit of invasive alien sp ecies is checked by the Central Plant Prevention Center and Central Veterinary Prevention Center under the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and customhouses. The National Committee for Emergency Quarantine has the functions of arranging collaboration between sectors at every stage of che ck, early warning, control and eradication of invasive alien species and of rapidly correspond ing to emergency. According to the data surveyed so far, more than 60 invasive alien species of plant have been rooted in our country. Pigweed ( Ambrosia artemisifolia ), the representative of invasive alien species, is notorious for its pollen that cau ses allergic diseases and for its threats to indigenous plant communities. As for animal, Lecidomja brachyntera and Matsucoccus pini are major invasive alien species harmful to forest, and Lissorhoptrus oryzopholis to paddy rice. The assessment on the impact of alien species to th e whole biodiversity of the country including protected areas is still in its infancy. In particular in the fishery, assessment of the impact from the aquatic animals and plants introduc ed for higher productivity has been sparsely conducted. Followings are suggested to be priorities for the c onservation of ecosystem, habitat and species and the sustainable use of bio-resources in DPR Korea: Preparing overall inventory of alien species in the country to evaluate their eco- environmental and economic threats; Enhancing the monitoring capacity on invasive alien species; Making the relevant legislations perfect; Establishing a national database on alien species; Raising public awareness of the impact of alien species; Promoting the training of experts concerned. It is particularly important to maintain red alert on avian influenza and take measures for its prevention. 2.1.6 Biosafety The Article 8 of the Convention on Biological Diver sity stipulates that each contracting party shall, as far as possible and as appropriate, establish or maintain means to regulate, manage or control the risks associated with the use and release of Living Modified Organisms (LMOs) resulting from biotechnology which are likel y to have adverse environmental impacts. DPR Korea signed the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafet y in April 2001 (ratified in July 2003). It had implemented the UNEP/GEF-supported pr oject \"Development of National Biosafety Framework\" during the period of 2002 to 2 004. Through the process of that project, framework of the national work system for research and development, production, export and National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 40 import and treatment of GMOs was provided in confor mity with the demand of the Cartagena Protocol. DPR Korea adopted the 'Law on the Biosafety of GMOs ' on December 22, 2004 and prepared regulations and by-laws for its enforcemen t. In March 2005, National Committee for Biosafety was established as a leading organ for biosafety management, and under the control of the State Academy of Science, National Management Center of Biosafety was inaugurated. At present, DPR Korea has the system and process in place to meet the demands of the Article 8 of the CBD and be able to prevent the thr eatening factors of GMOs to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity an d human's health. In future, it is necessary to guarantee the smooth operation of national biosafety system and to build biosafety-related capacity including t he regular identification and monitoring of the potential factors of threat to habitat and huma n's health. 2.2 Ex-situ Conservation It is the important solution to conservation of ani mals and plants to ensure stable life of the species population. But only the conservation a nd improvement of habitats are not just solution for species conservation, among the extinc tion species. Therefore, it needs to take measure for ex-situ conservation to reintroduce the proliferated popul ations to nature. Ex-situ conservation of wildlife and valuable biological r esources as well is quite important to development of the whole bio-industry including agriculture, fishery and forestry. Application of bio-engineering is significant in ex-situ conservation as well. 2.2.1 Ex-situ Conservation of Wildlife with Priority to Threaten ed Species Zoos and aquaria, botanical gardens and arboreta ha ve equipments and experts for breeding, cultivation and propagation of wildlife, and play important role in controlling hazardous degree for maintenance of populations and maintaining the local modified organisms. 2.2.1.1 Ex-situ conservation in Zoos and Aquaria The Central Zoo is located at the foot of Mt. Daeso ng in Pyongyang with an area of 100 ha and more than 650 animal species. DPRK has the zoos in every provincial capital where the local animals are kept in. The Central Zoo with good experiences in breeding o f extinction species including tiger, leopard and red-crowned crane, is intending to expa nd the area as much as twice for future. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 41 It is essential to take measures to strengthen the capacity of ex-situ conservation of extinction species in the Central Zoo, to register the pedigree of extinction species in close contact with the local zoos, and to improve breedin g and management of tame animals to make greater capacity of ex-situ conservation. 2.2.1.2 Ex-situ Conservation in Botanical Gardens and Arboreta The Central Botanical Garden, established in Pyongy ang, Capital of DPRK, with the area of 270 ha, and the local botanical gardens, the nat ure reserves in Mts. Paektu, Oga, Yangdok, Ongjin etc, the botanical gardens under the researc h institutes and flower gardens are key base for ex-situ conservation of the threatened species plants and industrial plants. In the Central Botanical Garden, more than 6,500 sp ecies of plants are being cultivated (2,500 species of them inhabited in our country). I t functions, in particular, as a breeding ground for \" Dendrobium Kimilsung flower \", bred in the Bogor Botanical Garden of Indonesia, and \" Begonia tuberhybrida Uoss cv. Kimjongilhwa \" bred by a Japanese horticulturist. .. Therefore, it needs to improve function and role of botanical gardens and arboreta for ex- situ conservation of critically endangered species. 2.2.2 Conservation of Genetic Resources Conservation of genetic resources is posed to be an urgent task, considering the global loss of biodiversity. It is essential to take measures of collection, cha racter assessment and rationalistic conservation of genetic resources which are contrib utable to agriculture, fishery, herbs and food industry for the industrial development of usi ng of biological resources. In DPRK, the conservation of crop and husbandry gen etic resources is put under the charges of the Agricultural Gene Bank of Pyongyang Crop Genetic Resources Institute and the Research Institute of Zootechnics of AAS, respe ctively. In addition, the Branch Academy of Forestry Science , SAOS, is a focal point for the conservation of arboreta, the Branch Academy of Fis hery Science for aquatic life genetic resources, and the Korean Center for Culture. It needs to keep the various conservation types pro per to genetic resources according to the long-term plans, including in type of seed, in-vitro , pollen, spore, DNA, and in-field, with material and technical, financial support for these works. International cooperation is also significant for g enetic resources conservation. In 2004, 'National Workshop on the Conservation and Use of P lant Genetic Resources in DPR Korea' took place in Pyongyang with the support from the I nternational Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI). National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 42 2.3 Sustainable Use of Biological Resources Sustainable use of biodiversity component is key pr oblem in the ecological environment conservation as well as development of agriculture, fishery, public health, food industry and bio-technology. In recent years, the government of DPR Korea, takin g account of the decisions of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, took a ser ies of national measures for the conservation of biological diversity and the sustai nable use of its components. Sustainable use of biodiversity components, in part icular bio-resources, is very significant for developing local economy and for im proving the agricultural eco-environment and the livelihood of local people and farmers. 2.3.1 Forestry 2.3.1.1 Status and Progress The DPR Korea, in which over 80% of territory is mo untainous, has relatively an wide area of forest land, but is small in a per-person a rea and poor in forest accumulation. The majority of its forest resources are concentrat ed in the northern part of the country, while seas and hillocks are poor in forest accumula tion. Particularly considering the forest destruction due to recent economic difficulties of the country, it is urgent to intensify the actions in order to halt the deterioration of eco-e nvironment, conserve forest biodiversity and raise the ecological service of forest. In 2005, forest land area in DPR Korea was 8,927,30 0ha, which accounts for about 72.5% of territorial area. Among forest land, treed forest land is 7,643,200ha wide, treeless forest land reaches 876,800ha and remains for other s. During the past decade, treeless forest land area had increased as wide as 496,800 ha from 380,000 ha (in 1996). Main factors for the expansion of treeless forest l and are excessive felling due to firewood shortage in rural areas and the unsustaina ble land reclamation for the cultivation of crops. Moreover damages by pest and disease related to the change of forest ecosystems and by fire are not ignorable. Without active measures to the protection of soil e rosion, it takes long time to recover the forests, once destroyed, in our country of having d ry spring, rainy summer (more than 60% of annual precipitation), steep and rugged mountains. In this context, the government of DPR Korea has pu t forward the policy for tree-planting and afforestation to increase forested area and to improve the structure and ecological function of the forest. Nationwide campaign for imp lementing this policy has been strenuously promoted. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 43 The MLEP arranged the restoration of destroyed nurs eries and the establishment of a new Central Nursery with an area of 100 ha in 2000, and also organized the construction of mother nurseries of 20-25 ha at municipal and county level s, which resulted in the increase of sapling production capacity in 2002 four times as much as t hat in 1994. since 2002, annual reforestation of over 900,000,000 trees has been or ganized as a nationwide campaign. The creation of firewood forests (total area of 800 ,000 ha) to solve the problem of wood for fuel, which is to blame for forest destruction and soil degradation, is gaining more and more impetus. On the other hand, the government of DPR Korea has quadrupled the number of forest rangers in order to strengthen legal controls on th e lawless deforestations and to improve forest management. In the field of forestry for lumber production, act ive reforestation has been promoted at deforested areas in compliance with the principle o f cyclic felling, and forest transformation and afforestation for erosion control have been ene rgetically driven at the areas low in productivity and extraordinary high in soil erosion . In particular, it is recommended to correct the ten dency to concentrate felling at the areas with favorable cutting conditions, and actively app ly the methods of lumber transportation which cause less forest and land destruction. 2.3.1.2 Assessment and Task of Sustainable Use In DPR Korea, forest land area is 0.4 ha per capita and average accumulation of forest tree is about a half of worldwide average. Expansion of sparsely wooded or treeless areas, in particular, at the hillocks around populated areas exacerbates the loss of soil and wa ter and thus exerts negative influence on agricultural ecosystems. In this context, it is imp ortant to promote afforestation preferably of hillsides and to take measures for the sustainable use of forest as well. It is important to actually promote the restoration and maintenance of degraded forests (740,000ha) through afforestation and succession, s ustainable management of industrial forests (2,000,000 ha), introduction of agro-forest ry management into sloping lands (340,000ha) and effective management of co-operativ e farms' forests (200,000 ha.) In relation to this, it is urgent to: Develop and disseminate effective technologies for the recovery of degrade d and destructed forest; Apply sustainable management approaches for national for est reserves and industrial forests, including intensive forestation of firewoo d forests with high productivity and eco-protective forests, and their sustainable use; Improve the catchment area management fundamentally; National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 44 Expand the size of protected areas and improve their conse rvation for both present and future benefits; Remove or mitigate the threats to forest biodiversity through the est ablishment and management of protected areas. The Global Strategy for Plant Conservation adopted at COP7 ( decision VI/9 ) stipulates as its 6th target that at least 30% of production lands shoul d be managed consistent with the conservation of plant diversity. For the proper balance between lumber production an d forest biodiversity conservation, it is imperative to create, disseminate and generalize the model of applying ecosystem approaches to flexible conservancy and management. For the conservation and sustainable use of forest resources, it is also important to establish and intensify the inter-sectoral relation s; and as cornerstone thereof the perfection of the monitoring systems and activities for public aw areness should be promoted with specially paying attention to maintenance of sound forest eco system and improvement of eco-service function. 2.3.2 Agriculture 2.3.2.1 Status and progress Soil is one of the main means of production in the agriculture which is generally carried out at natural environment. Since this is so, agric ulture is not only for crop production, but also closely related with land protection and other many functions. In 2005, agricultural land of DPR Korea was 2,042,1 00 ha, which accounts for 16.6% of the land area, with dry field (1,005,000 ha), paddy field (574,000 ha), orchard (144,000 ha) and mulberry field (85,000 ha). During the past decade, by the various kinds of con struction, about 60,000 ha of agricultural land have been vanished. Paddy-field farming is a traditional method of agri culture in DPR Korea. It is free from damages of repeated cultivation and from soil erosion, and does little harm to the underground water. Paddy-field farming, howe ver, requires durable and stable water supply, for which the conservation and management o f forest are prerequisite. As 80% of the whole territory of the country is mou ntainous, dry-field farming is always subject to soil erosion. At present, the area of sloping fields over 5\u00b0 reac hes 61% of whole dry-field area, while the arable sloping land over 16\u00b0 covers 18% of the territory. Sloping land management is as important as ever for ensuring the stability of agriculture. As for the arable sloping land, soil erosion, close ly related to the covered status, is almost twice around the deforested hillsides as severe as that of well-covered ones. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 45 Flood damages in 1995-1996 and difficulties in the country by economical sanctions have decreased the agricultural productivity and lowered the crop yields. Decrease in the fertility of soil, due to the loss of nutrients by soil erosion and deficiency of organic sources, hampers the increase of agricultural production. In view of these conditions, the government of DPR Korea is taking measures for securing the conservation, management and sustainab le use of land resources administratively and in a scientific and technical way, and mobilize s the whole country and all the people for it. In DPR Korea all the land properties are in possess ion of state or social and cooperative organizations, and the use and management of land r esources are strictly in conformity with the 'Land Law of DPR Korea'. During the \"General Mobilization Period for Land De velopment\" every spring and autumn, the cooperative farms make great effort to promote reforestation and conservation of forests. On the other hand, the government of DPR Korea has injected new vigor into the nationwide dissemination and application of scienti fic farming, in which whole farmland is integrated into ecological regions on the basis of physiographical assessment and land productivity evaluation and the agricultural struct ure is improved on the principle of cultivating the right crop at the right place. In the scientific farming, followings are essential s: improvement of crop structure; rearrangement of crop varieties; optimization of fertilizer distribution; selection of the right soil for double cropping and its expansion; effective use of fertilizers and agrochemicals; improvement of agricultural management; sloping land management; soil fertility increase; In 1998, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) prepared the strategy and action plan for the conservation of agricultural eco-environment and su stainable agricultural development, and is carrying forward it. In connection with soil fertility and food safety, active application of organic farming is gaining more attention. And in line with the 'green revolution policy', the MOA is vigorously promoting the highly productive varieties. Steady g rowth of bean farming, preservation of agricultural gene resources, expansion of microbe m anure production and intensification of plant quarantine, especially the control over the g enetically modified crops, are all its focal points. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 46 2.3.2.2 Assessment and task for sustainable use The area of farmland per capita in DPR Korea is 0.0 9ha and that for grain like rice and maize is not more than 0.06ha. In this context, protection and sustainable use of farmland emerges as one of the most pressing issues for the increase of agricultural pr oduction. Since the DPR Korea is particularly abundant with sloping lands and surrounded by sea o n two sides, it is very important for ensuring stable agricultural production to prevent soil erosion and create protective forests for fields of flat area. In recent years, through the implementation of the FAO-supported project for the application of protective farming, DPR Korea has ac cumulated considerable experiences. Such experiences should be disseminated extensively as soon as possible. Ongoing nationwide dissemination of scientific farm ing should be further accelerated so as to convert the agriculture into sustainable one. FAO considers sustainable farming to be the basic w ay of conserving and using natural resources and guarantee for firmly securing the nee d of present and next generations on agricultural products through the improvement of sy stem and technology. In DPR Korea, it is considered to be very important to solve the urgent food problem and to meet the growing demand for grains due to popula tion increase,. In this regard, followings are essential to: Promote scientific farming and improve agricultural infras tructure; Enhance the sense of responsibility and role of farmers as the masters of agriculture; Develop and disseminate the agricultural technologies for promoting the conservation and sustainable use of environmental r esources related to agriculture such as soil, forest and water resources, for decre asing the consumption of fertilizer and energy for agricultural production, and for gua ranteeing high efficiency and large yield with small investment. For the sustainable development of agriculture, spe cial attention must be paid to the conservation of agricultural biodiversity. For the conservation of agricultural biodiversity, research and development on the following items should be promoted. Establishment of comprehensive agricultural product ion system, especially the integration of agriculture and forestry; Type, structure and functions of complex agricultur al ecosystem; Conservation of crop genetic resources; Soil organisms in farmland and enhancement of soil fertility; Biological control of harmful insects to crops and livestock. Furthermore, the results and fruits of the research and development should be applied in consonance with the realities of the country. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 47 As each of these projects is still in its infancy, to establish a unique system comprising all the processes and to make it effective in the reali ty, are particularly important. Through these courses, systems and processes for the organic, eco logical and environment-protective farming, suited for the reality of the country, sho uld be established. Along with this, rearrangement of farm villages and reforestation of rural areas, in view of the environmental conditions, should be promoted . To increase the proportion of fruit trees in tree planting at rural areas is very useful for scenery, for farmers' real profit and for the general improvement of agro-ecological environment. In our country, intensive reforestation of fruit tr ees and establishment of agro-forestry ecosystems in farm villages and rural hillsides wil l exert positive influences on the following two problems: Raising public awareness and deepen the knowledge and unde rstanding of the goods and services from biodiversity; Increasing the quality of people's living; In relation to the conservation of agricultural bio diversity, special attention should be paid to the conservation and sustainable use of pol linators, which were mentioned at COP5. The total area of orchards is 144,000ha in DPR Kore a and the pollinators play great role in the increase of productivity of many fruits and vegetables. In consideration of the position and of pollinators in the food chain of agro-ecosys tem, it is important to evaluate their role and promote their conservation and sustainable use. 2.3.3 Fishery 2.3.3.1 Status and Progress It needs to take synthetic measures to ensure and s ustainably increase production of seafood for effective using in the people's livelih ood. It is very important for the DPR Korea with dense d rainage network and surrounded by sea on two sides to conserve and make of sustainabl e use inland water, coastal and marine ecosystems. In recent years, hard economic conditions in DPR Ko rea have hampered the growth of fisheries production. Waters area of DPR Korea reaches 737,400ha, about 6 % of total area. Inland water ecosystem biodiversity in DPR Korea is rich with 185 species of freshwater fishes, in addition to shellfish, lobster, aquatic plant, freshwater planktons and so on. Because of forest destruction in recent years, the environment of inland water ecosystems has undergone extensive changes. Water pollution by organic wastes makes the situation worse. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 48 Marine condition changes, decrease in aquatic resou rces due to excessive use in coastal areas and particularly the reduction of pelagic fis hery by recent hard economic conditions have hampered the growth of fisheries output. In this context, the Ministry of Fishery (MOF) and the Department of Fish Farming concentrate on expanding inland water fish farming and on the development of coastal cultivation, inter alia of seaweed. In consideration of the current economic conditions , the Ministry of Fishery (MOF) has adhered to the conversion of fishery from only catc hing fishery into cultivating one and achieved considerable successes therein. The Yanghwa Fishery Station and many others of the KWS and KES are equipped with breeding facilities for the aquatic plants and anim als of economic value, and much engaged in the creation, maintenance and management of coastal fishery. On the other hand, reformation of fishery structure toward the conservation and propagation of coastal non-migratory fishes is gain ing more attention as a new orientation for fishery development. In the inland water areas, extensive construction a nd enlargement of fish farms, and scientification and modernization of their manageme nt are being energetically promoted in order to meet the demands of the people for freshwa ter fishes. In accordance with the national measures, promotion of fish farming is gaining impetus as a movement of the whole masses. In DPR Korea wit h limited area for cultivation, the main direction of fish farming development is to make be st use of natural feeds and to expand the multi-dimensional fish breeding. In compliance with the legal requirements of the 'L aw on Fishery' and the 'Law on Fish Farming', state control for the conservation of aqu atic resources has further tightened. The MLEP is in charge of the management of 11 freshwate r aquatic resource reserves and 15 coastal ones. 2.3.3.2 Assessment and Task of Sustainable Use In DPR Korea, resource-preservative fishery at the coastal areas is still in its infancy and thus unable to satisfy the demand for fisheries pro ducts. In the field of fishery, proper balance between hig h productivity and biodiversity conservation of water ecosystems still remains unse ttled. First of all, the preparation of comprehensive plan for coastal management is imperative for the coastal fishery. For the promotion of this, it is important to establish a system for regularly investigating and monitoring coastal biod iversity in consideration of the importance of creating the framework of cultivating fishery an d of modernizing the shallow-sea farm management by scientific means. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 49 For the conservation and sustainable use of coastal bio-resources, the followings are also important: Intense activities for communication and public awa reness; Legislation of laws and regulations on resource man agement and pollution prevention; Establishment of systems and processes for coastal bio-resource management; Improvement of the management of coastal biodiversi ty reserves; Rearrangement of protected area system and enhancem ent of its functions; Assessment of the threats from alien species to coa stal biodiversity and establishment of appropriate tracing and monitoring system. In line with the expansive development of seaweed f arming and cultivating fishery, a great deal of efforts should be directed to the con servation and sustainable use of marine bio- resources. Above all, it is necessary to improve the resource management, to assess and develop the potentiality of marine bio-resources and to respect international conventions and agreements. It is a prerequisite for converting inland-water fi shery into a sustainable one to conserve Inland water biodiversity on the basis of ecosystem approaches closely integrated with the conservation and management of water resources and catchment area More attention should be paid as focal points to re cover degraded inland water ecosystems, to establish a tracing and monitoring s ystem on alien species, and to mitigate negative impacts on inland water ecosystem like hab itat destruction and pollution,. In particular, the conservation of threatened species of aquatic animals and plants in inland water area is very much important. For the conservation and sustainable use of inland water biodiversity, cross-sectoral integration, perfection of laws and regulations, an d public awareness of its importance are of great importance. In the development of fish-culture, followings are regarded as essential factors: Elevation of scientific level of fish farming; Normalization of fish farm operation; Perfection of the facilities for supply, drainage a nd recycling of water, and for waste treatment; Protection and improvement of the environment of fi sh farms. On the other hand, enhancement of the productivity of natural waters via the fish farms, e.g. the incubation and stocking of fishes like sal mon, trout, sweet fish, etc., should be energetically promoted. 2.3.4 Public Health (Traditional Korean medicines) National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 50 2.3.4.1 Status and progress In DPR Korea, the pharmaceutical industry of Koryo medicine is one of traditional ones, which comprises profound knowledge, abstruse expert ise and mysterious recipes accumulated for a long time. In DPR Korea, the production of Koryo medicines is under the direct control of the Management Bureau for Koryo Medicine Production (MB KMP), which is in charge of herb farms, stations for the protection and propagation of medicinal animals, and deer and musk pastures. Along with this, there are herb managemen t stations at municipal and county levels. The cultivation and use of medicinal plants in DPR Korea are subject to the Law on Medicinal Plant (Dec. 29, 2004) and its enforcement regulations. Under the control of the MBKMP, the Prospecting Tea m for Koryo Medicine Resources (PTKMR) undertakes the periodic nationwide investig ations on Koryo medicine resources, inter alia of medicinal plants. By relying on these investigation data which are classified by region and species, Designing Office for Koryo Medi cine Resources (DOKMR) prepares plans relevant to Koryo medicine resources. Technol ogy development for and dissemination of Koryo medicines are in charge of Korea Koryo Med icine Technology Center (KKMTC). Recent decrease in forest resources brought about t he changes of mountain ecosystem, which consequently made a great impact on the produ ction of natural medicinal herbs. These conditions make it difficult to meet growing demand s for Koryo medicines. 2.3.4.2 Assessment and Task for Sustainable Use There are about 900 species of medicinal plants in DPR Korea, 170 of which are widely used in traditional Koryo medicine. 70 of them are being cultivated. From the viewpoint of the conservation and sustaina ble use of natural medicinal herb resources, parts of herbs with medicinal value are of great importance. At present, 33% of the medicinal plants are for whole use, 30% for root, 5 .7% for fruit and seed, 2.6% for leaf, 1.8% for bark, 1.3% for flower, 1% for stem and twig and 0.8% for others. As to medicinal plants for the use of whole body, r oot or bark, excessive picking has a risk of exhausting their resources. In this regard, general investigation of medicinal herb resources and creation of its data base, conservation and creation of natural herb res ources and active role of herb farms, are indispensable for satisfying the growing demands fo r Koryo medicines. It is very important to improve the management of existing herb farms and t o increase the species and production of cultivated medicinal plants The MBKMP, KKMTC and the Pharmacology Institute of the Academy of Medical Sciences under the Ministry of Public Health are fo cal points of these operations. It is thus important to strengthen their capacity for resource conservation and medicine development. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 51 The establishment and management of protected areas are very important for the conservation and sustainable use of Koryo medicines . Special attention should be paid to the conservatio n and sustainable use of the threatened species with high economic value as Koryo medicine resources, e.g. Panax ginseng, which are listed in the \"Inventory of Threatened plants of DP R Korea\" (2005). As for the conservation and sustainable use of Kory o medicine resources, high sense of responsibility and active role of the local institu tions concerned and strict trade control are of great importance. In this regard, rigid enforcement of regulations and control for the strict observance of the Law on Medicinal Plants is impera tive. Moreover, it is important to protect the habitat environment of Koryo medicine resources and promote its creation. At the same time, researches on the medicinal herb cultivation should be intensified and efforts should be directed to satisfying growing demands. Special attention should be paid to the conservatio n and sustainable use of medicinal plant resources that are widely used in the Koryo m edicines. With this view, the mixed management of forestry and herb cultivation, i.e. i ntercropping of trees and medicinal plants, should be promoted and models suited to the geograp hical characteristics should be developed and generalized. And furthermore, ex-situ conservation of the genetic resources of Koryo med icine should be given great importance. Genetic resource conservation capacity of botanical gardens and arboreta should be intensified; and by the re-equipment and expansion of conservation facilities, a new turn should be brought about in the conservation of Kory o medicine resources that is the basis of traditional medicine. 2.3.5 Rest, recreation and tourism 2.3.5.1 Status and progress Rest, recreation and tourism, especially eco-touris m, are the parts of sustainable use of biodiversity that make people understand the import ance of biodiversity, and of gaining benefits from biodiversity. In DPR Korea, the areas with excellent scenic beaut y, e.g. Mts. Paektu, Myohyang, Kumgang, Chilbo, Kuwol, etc., are very famous as th e center of rest, recreation and tourism. Sanatoria and recreation centers are placed at the areas with diverse scenic beauties. Particularly, in the nature parks and scenic spots, the Children's Union camps are built for rising generations. Every year, hundreds of thousan ds of people visit the revolutionary battlefields and historic sites, at where the campi ng places and lodging houses are provided. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 52 Recently, each county is preparing the recreation c enters for farmers at its places of scenic beauty to promote their rest and recreation. 2.3.5.2 Assessment and Task for Sustainable Use In DPR Korea, there are a lot of recreation facilit ies, Children's Union camps and lodging houses at old revolutionary battlefields, but the e ducation and communication for public awareness of the conservation and sustainable use o f biodiversity are still in their infancy. The lack of personnel who can be in charge of those res ponsibilities is one of the most important factors and thus training and securing of the talen ted personnel are considered to be very much important. It is also important to prepare action plans, to pr ovide necessary information, to reinforce insufficient infrastructure and to establish a unif ied network, especially, to provide the expanded nature parks with necessary facilities. According to the recent state measure that all stud ents are recommended to make excursion to Mt. Chibo, proper campaign has been co nducted for preparing appropriate conditions. In this context, further promotion of t he field education on biodiversity is indispensable. Peoples' contact with nature through public gardens and surrounding forests of cities, beaches and riversides should be promoted according to the actual conditions of rural and urban communities and costal and mountainous villag es. For this purpose, the creation and operation of working space for the education and co mmunication of the value and importance of biodiversity and its sustainable use should be g iven foremost importance. 2.3.6 Bio-engineering by using of genetic resource s It is one kind of sustainable use of biodiversity c omponents. In recent days, biotechnology plays a great role in agriculture, public health and environmental conservation. Biotechnology is applied to rearing of the new high anti-harmful insect, species resistant to drought and salt in agriculture, to the producti on of growth hormone with transform technique of nucleic acid and of gene therapy drug in the public health and to the improvement of food industry with using of microbia l gene resources including amino acid, lactic acid, and vitamin, hormone and anti-biotic m aterials in food industry etc. Biotechnology in the environmental protection is al so significant, including techniques of pollution abatement and purification of environment with treating with salvages and waste water. DPRK has been advancing Research and development of bio-engineering at the national level. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 53 The fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources is arising from utilization of genetic resources with using of bio- engineering. For this, it needs to establish the legal framework of benefit sharing arising from the genetic resources and to promote the international collaboration. 2.4 Identification and monitoring of components of biological diversity Field investigation, inventory preparation and moni toring of the distribution, actual state and utilization of bio-resources should be conducte d in order to identify the components important for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Particular attention should be paid to the elements requiring urgent conservation measures and those which offer the greatest potenti al for sustainable use. It is also important to identify processes and categories of activities which have or are likely to have significant adverse impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and to monitor and reduce their effects. (Article 7 of the CBD) A great deal of importance should be attached to th e identification and monitoring on the components of biodiversity, which constitute the ba sis of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment it. 2.4.1 Identification and monitoring In DPR Korea, the subsidiary institutes of the SAOS are responsible for the investigation on natural environment. In recent years, the SAOS has carried out over-all investigations on the main nature reserves of the country for biodiversity conservati on. The \"Encyclopedia of Mt. Paektu\" was published as a result of the comprehensive investigation over the area of Mt. Paektu in the 19 90's. And in the early 2000's, a series of biodiversity investigation data on nature reserves was published as follows; \"Biodiversity of Mt. Kumgang\" (with support from UN ESCO in 2000) \"Threatened and Rare Species of Animals of DPR Kore a\" (in 2000) \"Threatened and Rare Species of Plants of DPR Korea \" (in 2005) Further intensification of the basic surveys for na tural environment protection and biodiversity investigation should be promoted. In t his regard, the establishment of the information network for gathering information and d ata about biodiversity conservation and supplying them to the authorities concerned is indi spensable. With this view, more progress should be made in the scientific research work in t he field of taxonomy and ecology. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 54 2.4.1.1 Needs and capacity building in the field o f taxonomy For the identification of and monitoring on the com ponents of biodiversity, the preparation of the biodiversity inventory should be conducted, which will conduct synthesis and analysis of the information about the status an d trends of gene, individual, population, community, habitat and ecosystem through the proces ses, such as investigation, classification, quantification, mapping and so on. In this context, active role of the taxonomists is indispensable. In DPR Korea, taxonomic study on the higher plants and vertebrates has progressed comparatively well, but the research on invertebrat es (estimated number of species reaches over 200,000, but only 10,000 species were recorded ) and lower plants (esp. Ascomycetes ) has many holes. Moreover, the enhanced role of specimen gallery as an infrastructure of taxonomy is posed to be urgent. Herbaria at the Institute of Botany under the SAOS (with about 130,000 specimens of higher plants and 200,000 of lower ones) and the Ce ntral Botanical Garden (with over 300,000 of higher plants) are the centers for the c onservation of botanical specimens, while the Institute of Zoology under the SAOS (2000 speci mens of vertebrates and insects and 100,000 of others) and the Nature Museum of the Kim Il Sung University are for zoological specimens. However, these facilities have the low-l evel technical equipments for specimen conservation. And the training of talented taxonomist is also imp ortant. At present, the institutions and organizations engaged in the taxonomic study and re search are as follows: - SAOS Institute of Botany and Institute of Zoology under the Branch Academy of Biology; East Sea Fishery Institute and West Sea Fishery Ins titute under the Branch Academy of Fishery; Economic Forest Institute and Breeding Science Inst itute under the Branch Academy of Forestry; - Ministry of Education (MOE) Kim Il Sung University; Kim Hyong Jik University of Education; The universities and colleges of education and agri culture at provincial level (esp. Wonsan University of Agriculture); - Mt. Daesong Management Bureau (MDMB) Central Botanical Garden; Central Zoo. But all these facilities and organizations are cons iderably lacking in the reserve taxonomists. In this regard, retraining of present research personnel, education and training of National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 55 the new ones and education on the fundamentals of t axonomic study at the higher education system, are very important. On the other hand, it is important to establish a c entral institution which will coordinate the taxonomic research work in a unified way. It is a prerequisite for pushing forward the taxono mical investigation and research, expert training, information exchange and infrastructure c onstruction at the same time. For the conservation and sustainable use of biodive rsity, database of classified information is also indispensable. In addition to the above-mentioned issues, internat ional exchange and collaboration with DIVERSITAS, BioNET, etc. should be intensified for the further development of taxonomic research in our country. Through these processes, the modernization of taxon omic methodology and the improvement of the capacity of taxonomic institutio ns should be promoted, so as to make the taxonomy more contributable to the identification o f biodiversity components. 2.4.1.2 Monitoring of Biodiversity It is of great urgency to set up regular and/or irr egular monitoring system on the status and change of biodiversity. The priority targets of this system are the forest, inland water and coastal area ecosystems. The Branch Academy of Forestry under SAOS, the MLEP and the Ministry of Forestry (MOFr) are conducting irregular monitoring on the f orest ecosystems respectively. In this context, it is necessary to perfect the fac ilities for regular monitoring of typical forest ecosystem, to improve the evaluation indicat ors and to intensify monitoring activities. Since the disturbance of ecosystem due to forest de struction affects not only forest itself but also inland water and coastal area ecosystems, following measures are necessary to: Set up the monitoring system on protected areas urgently a nd expand it gradually to a comprehensive one on the typical water ecosystems a nd finally to a national network. Perform regular, continuous and comprehensive investigation and monitoring on the biodiversity of reservoirs, rivers and coastal area s with high productivity. 2.4.2 Identification and monitoring of the activit ies affecting biodiversity In DPR Korea, following processes and activities ha ve or are likely to have significant adverse impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity: Excessive exploitation of natural resources causing the destruction of ecosystem and habitat (firewood cutting, load construction and so on); National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 56 Development projects (land reclamation, constructio n of hydraulic structures and industrial plants, etc.) causing the loss of ecosys tem and habitat; Activities (discharge of sewage and waste water, in appropriate consumption of chemical fertilizers and agrochemicals) that cause the degradation of ecosystem and habitat; Uncontrolled introduction of alien species and irre sponsible picking and hunting of particular species (medicinal herbs, large animals, etc.) that might cause the ecosystem disturbance. Since over 80% of territory is mountainous in DPR K orea, forest and sloping land management is one of the most vital problems in mai ntaining the ecosystem stability. In recent years, the greatest challenges to the com ponents of biodiversity are over-felling of trees for firewood and lumber, reclamation of fo rest land and the subsequent soil erosion, e.g. decrease of organic matters in forest land, ar idity of forest land and decline of water accumulation. The defects in sloping land management consequently exert influence on inland water and coastal ecosystem biodiversity. On the other hand, over-exploitation of coastal aqu atic resources has adverse impacts on the coastal biodiversity. Hence, it is of great imp ortance to set up a monitoring and information system to prevent excessive forest expl oitation, discriminative felling, damage by pest and diseases, forest fire, avalanche and overu se and pollution of coastal aquatic resources. 2.4.3 Environmental impact assessment (EIA) Article 4 of the Convention on Biological Diversity stipulates that each Contracting Party should introduce appropriate procedures requiring e nvironmental impact assessment of its proposed project that are likely to have significan t adverse effects on biodiversity with a view to avoiding or minimizing such effects and, where a ppropriate, allow for public participation in such procedures. DPR Korea has been constantly taking measures to de crease or eliminate the factors that are likely to have adverse effects on land and envi ronment through the legislation of following Planning\" (2002); \"Law on City Planning\" (2003); National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 57 Relying on these bases, DPR Korea formulated the 'L aw on Environmental Impact Assessment' in 2006 to assess beforehand the enviro nmental impact of the various sectorl plans of national economy including construction. The Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (ML EP) is a supervisory body for its enforcement. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is one of the components of environment assessment together with the environmental pollutio n and environmental quality assessment. Smooth performance of EIA requires the selection of evaluation factors, establishment of indicator system and the preparation of reliable re port based on proper evaluation method. The Institute of Environmental Protection under the MLEP is responsible for the scientific and technological research work for this purpose. In our country, it is very important to see to it t hat all the projects are observant of state standards which have, already, been formulated for the prevention of environmental pollution. Regional assessment of the adverse effects to ecolo gical state and security and ecosystem services should be conducted to promote the general improvement of regional eco- environment. In this context, the public education and communica tion of EIA should be attached great importance as a prerequisite for the voluntary obse rvance of state laws and regulations. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 58 Chapter 3 Cross-cutting measures for the conservation of biodiversity in DPR Korea Successful conservation and sustainable use of biod iversity requires its integration into the national economic plans simultaneously with est ablishment of the legal framework for biodiversity conservation. In addition, due review and the relevant measures a re required on the central and local administrative institutions to ensure the integrate d leadership and planning, the cooperation and comprehensive management for conservation and s ustainable use of biodiversity, with the creation and provision of financial resources. And it is also necessary to promote scientific rese arch, to enhance public education and training on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and to create, generalize and promote the models in this field. It needs more to promote the cooperation with the i nternational and regional organizations for extension of information exchange and technical and scientific collaboration with the requirement of the Article 17 and 18 of CB D. 3.1 Legislations The Article 57 of the \"Socialist Constitutional Law of DPR Korea\" regulates the importance of the state role in environmental prote ction. The \"Law on Environmental Protection\" is the main l aw for the environmental protection in DPR Korea (issued on April 9, 1986, modified and supplemented on March 4, 1999 and July 4, 2000). Important laws relevant to the conservation of envi ronment and biodiversity are as of Cultural Relics\" (1994); \"Law on the Protection of Scenic Spots and Natural Monuments\" (1995); National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 59 Fishery\" (1995); \"Law on Hygienic Quarantine\" (1996); \"Law for Land and ment\" (1998); \"Law on \"Law on the the Pollution of River Ta edong (2005); \"Law on Environmental Impact Assessment\" (2005); \"Law on Organic Industry\" (2005) In recent years, various sectoral and thematic laws , regulations and specific rules for the conservation of environment and biodiversity have b een legislated. Although there are laws and regulations closely rel ated to biodiversity conservation, DPRK has no laws on the conservation of wild plant and threatened species and the comprehensive biodiversity conservation and therefo re, still some challenges remained. But further reinforcement of legal system is expected f or the conservation of eco-environment and biodiversity. In this context, it is necessary to supplement the relevant laws and regulations and take the measures to strictly keep them for the biodiver sity conservation and its sustainable use. The nationwide movement for winning the title of \"M odel Law-abiding County (City)\" is gaining more impetus as an effective way for raisin g the spirit of law observance. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 60 3.2 Administrative institutions The National Coordinating Committee for Environment (NCCE) under the Cabinet of DPR Korea is a non-permanent organization for envir onmental protection and the Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP) is a represe ntative one in this field. Under the unified coordination of the Cabinet, foll owing central organizations and institutions are engaged in the conservation and su stainable use of biodiversity: Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP); State Planning Commission (SPC); State Academy of Sciences (SAOS); Ministry of Agriculture (MOA); Ministry of Fishery (MOF); Ministry of Forestry (MOFr); Ministry of Education (MOE); Ministry of Public Health (MOPH); Ministry of City Management (MOCM); Ministry of Trade (MOT); Ministry of Construction Supervision (MOCS); Ministry of Finance (MOFn); Ministry of People's Security (MOPS); Cultural Relics Conservation Administration (CPCA); Management Bureau of Revolutionary Site Mt. Daesong Management Bureau (MDMB, administrative organ over the Central Botanical Garden and Central Zoo) People's committees at provincial, municipal and co unty levels are the regional power and administrative organs in DPR Korea and they are focal points of environmental protection activities conducting at local levels. As there is no central or local administrative inst itution in charge of biodiversity, the collaboration is indispensable between various orga nizations concerned (forestry, agriculture, environmental protection, fishery, construction). The Cabinet is responsible for the coordination of the concerted activities of central organizations. Scientific research work for the conservation and s ustainable use of biodiversity is directed by the State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) in a unified way. The Korea Nature Conservation Union (KNCU) and Kore an Federation of Science and Technology (KFST) are main non-governmental organiz ations which play active role in the biodiversity conservation. The KNCU, responsible fo r public education and communication, has sectoral and thematic subordinate associations such as the Korean Association of Plant Protection, Korean Association of Animal Protection and Korean Association of Water National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 61 Resources, etc. The Korean Federation of Science & Technology (KFST) is in charge of the transfer and dissemination of science and technolog y on resource management and eco- environment conservation. Academic institutions such as the Society of Biolog y, the Society of Zoology, the Society of Botany, the Society of Agriculture, the Society of Forestry and the Society of Horticulture, are all engaged in the research, communication, edu cation and scientific exchange. For the conservation and sustainable use of biodive rsity, it is desirable to establish an institution with authority to direct the activity o f relevant organizations, and also to strengthen the systematic guidance and control over the assign ment and execution of responsibilities. 3.3 Science and technology The SAOS is the focal point of research and develop ment for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Related to biodiversity conservation and sustainabl e use are: Branch Academy of Biology (Institute of Botany, Ins titute of Zoology, Institute of Experimental Biology, Biodiversity and Eco-engineer ing Center, Institute of Mushroom and Koryo Pesticide Center); Branch Academy of Cell and Genetic Engineering; Branch Academy of Fishery (Institute of Marine Cult ivation and Institute of Fishery at both seas); Branch Academy of Forestry (Institute of Economic F orest, Institute of Forest Management, Breeding Institute, Institute of Plant Protection, etc.); Institute of Microbiology and Institute of Geology. It is responsible for the supervision and control o ver the scientific research and technological development not only in its affiliate d bodies, but also at the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Academy of Medical Sciences, Environment and Development Center under the MLEP, Kim Il Sung University (Department of Bio-Sciences and Department of Global Environment), Kim Hyong Jik University of Ed ucation (departments of Biology and Geology). Representative research projects (1995-2006) for en vironmental protection and biodiversity conservation are as follows (except fo r the research projects on protected areas mentioned at Part 1.4 of Chapter 2 related to scien tific research): - Forestry Reasonable forest management at the catchment area of River Taedong; Rapid afforestation of lowland mountains by the imp roved sapling production and planting method; Assessment of the water-regulation function of main forest tree species; National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 62 Creation of forest tree resources with economic val ue (e.g. yew of Jagang Province); Sapling propagation of rapid-growing poplar; Improvement of planting method and after-planting c are of trees; Practical use of willow ( Salix andersoniana ) for firewood; - Fishery Investigation on the distribution and quantity of i ndustrial non-migratory aquatic resources at the coast of South Hwanghae Province; Clarification of migratory characteristics and reso urce structure of anadromous and catadromous fishes via the fish-way of the West Sea Barrage; Assessment of the impact by over-exploitation of th e major productive species of shellfish resources in the Korean East Sea and the prescription of the reasonable production limitation; Estimation of the recovery status of deep-sea fish resource in the KES; Factors on shellfish resources and its conservation ; Artificial fishing reef for the increase in aquatic resources; Application of cultivating fishery [stocking of sea cucumber ( Stichopus japonica) , echinus and haliotis]; - Agriculture Research on the microflora of soil applied with mic robial fertilizers; Establishment of organic-oriented fertilizing syste m correspondent to soil status; Genetic resources of crops; Application of botanical chemicals for the preventi on of mulberry insects and mulberry silkworm grasserie (nuclear polyhedrosis); Production and application of biological phosphate fertilizer; - Environment protection Impact of sandy dust phenomena on growth and yield of crops; Distribution of sandy dust phenomena in DPR Korea a nd its impact on eco- environment; Development of environment cleansing techniques by using effective microorganisms; Waste water purification and substitution of paper material by Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes); Waste water purification of high grade by biologica l method; Industrial waste water purification and metal recla mation by microbes; Eco-environment preservation at the downstream area of River Tumen; - Geographical Information system (GIS) GIS for the selection of right soil for crops and f orest; National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 63 Forest resource estimation system via GIS; 3S system and information processing for the effect ive development and use of national resources; Mapping of vegetation by analyzing satellite inform ation; Natural resources estimation system via satellite i nformation; - Taxonomy Taxonomical research on the plant communities of DP R Korea Preparation of thematic floras Preparation of thematic faunas Remarkable achievements have been registered in the R&D for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Various kinds of books have been published, such as \"Flora of Korea\", \"Spore-bearing Plants Korea\", \"Pisces the Korean West Sea\", \"Pisces of Korean East Sea\" and \"Freshwater Fishes of Korea\", etc. Conservation of threatened species, including crane and black-faced spoonbill, has been considered as an important research project and com prehensive investigation and research have been recently conducted on the Mundok Migrator y Bird Reserve, situated at the estuary of River Chongchon, which is a significant spot on the East Asia-Australia flyway. The Branch Academy of Cell & Genetic Engineering (B CGE), SAOS, is the focal point of the R&D for bio-safety and the establishment of national bio-safety system. However, there are still many holes in the R&D for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Representative research projects and development it ems are as follows: Basic researches on phylogeny, inventory preparatio n and taxonomy so as to fill the holes in taxonomic study on the diversity of animal s, plants and microorganisms Ecological research into the factors which have or are likely to have significant impacts on the function of biodiversity Systematic study on the conservation, restoration a nd sustainable use of biodiversity; R&D for the establishment of biodiversity monitorin g system and information network. (Importance of biodiversity inventory and information gap between areas are considered) Rearrangement of microorganism inventory Gene analysis for inter-specific biodiversity and r esearch item for bio-safety. International cooperation for the joint research an d global information network is very much contributable to the conservation and sustaina ble use of biodiversity. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 64 In this regard, it is likely to be necessary to set up a specialized institution under the SAOS, so called 'Biodiversity Committee', which wil l coordinate the R&D for biodiversity in a unified way. The far-sighted and future-oriented combination of basic and applied researches for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and the close collaboration between research institutes, universities and field institutions to avoid duplication and wasteful repetition will be its main responsibility . On the other hand, the dissemination of biodiversit y-related knowledge and information should be promoted and data sharing system establis hed. Measures for the development of science and technol ogy related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity should be taken to improve human, technical and technological capacity in support of the implementation of the st rategic objectives of the 2010 Biodiversity Targets. 3.4 Education and communication 3.4.1 Education The 11-year compulsory education system of DPR Kore a comprises 3 stages of kindergarten (1-year preschool education), primary school (4-year) and middle school (6- year). The education on environment protection begins at t he stage of kindergarten and continues through the stage of primary education (N ature Observation during the 1 st and 2 nd grades and Nature subject during the 3 rd and 4 th grades). At middle school, Biology and Geography subjects are providing students with the knowledge of animal and plant conservation and environment protection. 14 teacher-training colleges and 19 universities of education are conducting the teacher training for primary and middle school. At the stage of higher education, subjects related to environmental protection have been taught since 1993 in consonance with the actual con dition of every unit. The Faculty of Biology and Faculty of Geography of the Kim Il Sung University were renamed Faculty of Life Science and Faculty of Glob al Environment, respectively, at the early 2000's. Agricultural universities and fisheries colleges at provincial level, especially Hyesan Agro-Forestry College in Ryanggang Province and Pih yon Land Administration College in North Pyongan Province, are attaching great importa nce to the education on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. In every province (including municipality), there a re school children's palaces that play the role as a center of extracurricular education f or primary and middle school pupils. In its science education, special attention is being paid to nature conservation. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 65 Care-for-the-homeland Teams in every primary and mi ddle school, whose mission is to maintain the cultural and sanitary conditions of th eir villages, streets and towns, are conducting various activities for biodiversity cons ervation, especially during the period of 'Month for Beneficial Birds' in April and 'Month of Tree Planting' in March and November. Further improvement of the quality of education on biodiversity conservation and its sustainable use should be promoted at the stages of middle and higher education. In this regard, it is necessary: for the stage of secondary education, to promote th e in-service training of teaching staff, and to author and spread multimedia products related to biodiversity in accordance with actual conditions of primary and mi ddle schools; for higher education, to foster manufacture and dis seminate multimedia teaching aids suited to the condition of university and coll ege, and to intensify data collection of advanced technologies related to biod iversity and its wide spread. Preparation of Action Plan for the information sect or of environment and biodiversity education, and the active operation of its focal po int are very important for above-mentioned purposes. 3.4.2 Dissemination and communication Communication for public awareness, as well as prof essional education, is very important for the conservation and sustainable use of biodive rsity. Various kinds of communication media such as TV, ra dio, newspaper and magazine, are engaged in the dissemination of the basic knowledge of biodiversity and the communication of its importance. The Korean Natural Conservation Union (KNCU) is the focal point of these communication activities. Either the international days like \"Day of Global E nvironment\" and \"Day of Biodiversity\" or national occasions such as \"Month of Tree-planting\", \"Month of Bird Conservation\", \"Month of Conservati on\" and \"Month of Medical Herb Cultivation\" are representative periods for the com munication campaign on biodiversity Moreover, communication related to biodiversity con servation and nature protection is actively undertaken at natural parks, scenic spots, city parks, zoological and botanical gardens and arboreta, in close relation with extracurricula r education at schools. Along with the active role of the KNCU, joint effor t and coordinated operation of the working people's organizations such as the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, the Union of Agricultural Working People of Korea, the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League and the Korean Democratic Women's Union, are very impor tant for the planning and implementation of social activities for public awar eness and enlightenment on ecological safety. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 66 On the other hand, active participation of the Kore an Federation of Science and Technology (KFST) for disseminating techniques rela ted to biodiversity is very much desirable. For the promotion of communication, education and p ublic awareness, as mentioned at COP8, implementation structure and processes should be established and action plan for this should be prepared. In particular, measures for establishing e-infrastr ucture and network in harmony with the IT era should be taken. They will provide more favo rable conditions for promoting public participation in the implementation of the 2010 Bio diversity Target 3.5 Training It is important to train experts competent to the c onservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and to reeducate public officials of t he authorities concerned and teaching staff. In this regard, more experts in environment, biolog y and resource management should be trained by improving the capacity of the Kim Il Sun g University and other universities and colleges of agriculture, fishery, education and con struction & building materials. Along with this, retraining of the protected area m anagement personnel for their better quality is indispensable. In particular the role of the University of National Economy, central reeducation institution for administrative staff of national and local levels, is vital to promote understanding of the importance of biodiversity and to improve capacity of the incumbent officials with respect to the conservation and sust ainable use of biodiversity. Action plan comprising all these problems should be prepared an d implemented. 3.6 Model creation To make models for protected area management, susta inable use of bio-resources, restoration and sustainable development of degraded ecosystem and creation and management of agro-forestry ecosystem and to generalize them a re of great significance for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. 3.6.1 Development of Models of Nature Reserves Through the implementation of the projects, \"Conser vation of Biodiversity at Mt. Myohyang Nature Park\" (2000-2003) Korean West Sea\" (2003-2006), GEF had supported the manage ment of Mt. Myohyang Nature Park and Mundok Migratory Bird Reserve (Wetland). Generalization of the experiences from these projec ts is very important. On the other hand, management of the Mt. Paektu Bio sphere Reserve and Mt. Kuwol Biosphere Reserve which have been registered in the biosphere reserve network of UNESCO National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 67 should be promoted and models of scientific researc h, diversification and resource management should be developed and propagated. 3.6.2 Development of Models of the Sustainable Use of Biodiversity Following items should be considered as main subjec ts of model development for the activation of local economy and income increase of rural population by means of simultaneous seeking of economic and eco-environmen tal profits. For forestry: catchment area management, restoratio n of degraded forest ecosystem and its sustainable use; For fishery: cultivating fishery and seaweed cultiv ation; For medicinal plant cultivation: resource creation and sustainable use of medicinal herbs For agriculture: creation of agro-forestry ecosyste m and mixed management framework. 3.6.3 Application of Ecosystem Approach to Model D evelopment For the conservation and sustainable use of biodive rsity, which is conducted at different socio-economic conditions, adaptable management met hodologies are indispensable. Ecosystem approach, based on modern comprehensive m anagement methodology, integrates appropriate technologies and innovative approaches for the effective management of protected areas, conservation of species and sus tainable use of bio-resources, and is applied to the adaptable management practice which is ensur ing cross-sectoral cooperation. Via the development of models, how the comprehensiv e management methodology is applied to the management activities of proper scal e in complicated practical situations will be demonstrated. For the present, models of ecosystem approach appli ed to the sustainable management of forest, coast and agro-forestry should be developed immediately. 3.7 Incentive Measures 'Each Contracting Party shall, as far as possible a nd as appropriate, adopt economically and socially sound measures that act as incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.' (Article 11 of the CBD) The subsidies from the Government and local power o rgans for the development of above-mentioned biodiversity models are examples of economical incentive measure. Capacity-building of the tree nurseries of central and local levels for the reforestation of destroyed forest is being promoted by the state bud get of the Government of DPRK. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 68 The Korean Natural Conservation Union (KNCU) has, r ecently, established the \"Korean Nature Conservation Fund\" to encourage nature conse rvation. In the DPK Korea, various social incentive measures are also promoting nature and biodiversity conservation. They include national co mmendation for excellent activities related to wildlife protection and tree planting, award and prize for all sorts of symposia. For the conservation and sustainable use of biodive rsity, adoption of social and economical incentives should be further extended an d strengthened. 3.8 International Cooperation Since the conservation of biodiversity is a regiona l and global problem beyond the boundary of one nation, DPR Korea attaches great im portance to the international cooperation in this field. 3.8.1 Cooperation with International Organizations During the past decade, GEF-supported projects, \"Co nservation of Biodiversity at Park\" (2000-2003) and \"Coastal Biod iversity Management at Korean West Sea\" (2003-2006), have been undertaken in DPR Korea for the implementation of the CBD. Through these courses, considerable progresses have been made in the management of protected areas and forestry ecosystem and the cons ervation of wetland ecosystem biodiversity. Since 2003, as partial projects of the \"Plan for Ag riculture Restoration and Environmental Protection', 'Comprehensive Catchment area Management at Highlands' and some other projects have been undertaken in DPR Kor ea under the auspices of the FAO. Those projects were particularly significant for DP R Korea where the mountain forestation and safety of agricultural production are closely r elated. From 2006, FAO, through its supports for the projec ts of forestation and protection of agricultural production in plains, has been and is still promoting the development of models for small basin management at hill areas, riverside protection and construction of agro- forestry ecosystem. Protective agriculture projects were also conducted with the assistance of FAO. On the other hand, several cooperation projects for seed improvement, food supply, vermin control, grazing and small-scale animal husb andry, have been conducted by various international organizations including UNDP. DPR Korea signed the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafet y in 2001 and ratified it in July, 2003. For its implementation, UNEP-supported projec t, 'Development of National Biosafety Framework in DPR Korea', was executed (2002-2004). The implementation of this project was geared to the establishment of national system for boisafety, resulting in the fundamental National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 69 framework of legislative and administrative system, application and approval system, risk assessment system, public education system and data exchange system for biosafety. GEF and UNEP have supported, in 2004, the implement ation of the project, \"National Capacity Needs Self-Assessment for Global Environme nt Management in DPR Korea\" (NCSA), through which the assessment of constraints and need of capacity-building and priority order for the implementation of 3 major co nventions was carried out. 3.8.2 Bilateral Cooperation Swiss-supported project, \"Sloping Land Management i n Suan County\" (from 2000), can be cited as an example of bilateral cooperation in the field of biodiversity. Main aim of the project is to develop a model of agro-forestry mana gement. Agriculture-related cooperative projects have also been promoted energetically. The representative one is \"Leguminous Manure Crop and I ts Minimum Plowing for Rice/Corn- centered Grain Cultivation\" (2000) with the support from the International Agricultural Research Centre in Australia. In particular, the \"National Workshop on Conservati on and Use of Plant Genetic Resources\" was held under the auspices of the Inter national Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) in 2001. 3.8.3 International Joint Research In close cooperation with UNESCO, the MAB Internati onal Joint Research Project had been successfully conducted, resulting in the regis tration of the Mt. Kuwol area as an International Biosphere Reserve following the Mt. P aektu Biosphere Reserve. The conservation and management of the Mt. Paektu a nd Mt. Kuwol Biosphere Reserves which are included in the East Asia Network of Inte rnational Biosphere Reserves is of great significance for biodiversity conservation. In this regard, the establishment of field facilities for long-term survey, research, education and enlig htenment in the both biosphere reserves is vital. 3.8.4 Others During the past decade, the collaboration with NGOs of several countries has been very active in DPR Korea. The representative ones of NGO -supported projects are as follows: \"Introduction of organic farming and green manure c rops\" by the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC); \"Grassland Creation, Goat Rearing and Milk Processi ng\" by the Campus for Christs; \"Operation of the Environmental Information Centre\" by the Environmental Education Media Plan (EEMP). National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 70 3.8.5 Promotion of International Cooperation In 2006, strategic framework for the cooperation be tween DPR Korea and United Nations was created, in which the biodiversity-related envi ronment management was considered to comprise the development of environment-concerned l aws, strategies and programs, capacity- building, sustainable use of environmental resource s, prevention of environmental pollution and ecosystem management. Taking the strategic framework into consideration, the arrangement of domestic conditions, active information exchange and more regular and ha rmonious contacts with international and regional organizations are vital for the promotion of international cooperation with respect to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversit y. Through the international cooperation, access to an d transfer of advanced technologies, technical and scientific cooperation, expert traini ng and inter-governmental exchange should be promoted in accordance with the requirements of the Articles 16 and 18 of the CBD. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 71 Chapter 4 National Strategy of DPR Korea for Biodiversity Conservation The President Kim Il Sung , father of socialist Korea, had often given earnes t instructions to make our country as a tapestry-like land teeming with birds and animals and set forth directions and ways of improving the people's livel ihood by making better use of mountains and seas. The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il said that our country, so blessed with scenic beauty and natural resources as to be called 'golde n tapestry of three thousand ri ', should be further protected and elaborated, and thus transfor med into a socialist paradise and golden tapestry of the Worker's Party era with picturesque landscape and all kinds of fruits. The national strategy for biodiversity conservation is geared to make the whole country as a tapestry-like land teeming with birds and anim als and to make people lead an affluent and civilized life by thoroughly implementing the last instructions of President Kim Il Sung and the plan and intention of the great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il. It will also serve the perfect implementation of international obligations require d by CBD. 4.1 Strategic goals The biodiversity conservation in DPR Korea is aimed at transforming the country into a socialist paradise and golden tapestry of the Worke r's Party era, to promote the conservation of wild animals/plants and their eco-environment an d make sustainable use of mountains, rivers, coasts and seas, thus enabling people to en joy substantial benefits from biodiversity. The strategic goals of biodiversity conservation an d sustainable use make it a principle to: Give precedence to the conservation; Put an emphasis to priorities while improving eco-envi ronment as a whole; Make sustainable use of natural resources, as to ensure the sustainable development in good harmonization with natural resources, envir onment and industry. In this regard, the long-term objectives of the nat ional biodiversity strategy are: to enhance the conservative ability of protected ar eas including nature reserves and to establish protected area networks, so as to comp lete national protected area system; to make efforts to conserve ecosystem, species and genetic resources and establish the system for sustainable use of biodiversity comp onents while, thus enabling the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 72 present and coming generations to enjoy the rich an d civilized life with benefits from biodiversity. The immediate objectives are: to restore degraded ecosystems, halt the deteriorat ion of ecological environment, reduce the rate of loss of biodiversity components and improve the whole ecological environment; to improve the management of nature reserves for ra ising the effectiveness of the system; to increase bio-productivity and service function o f ecosystem and establish the system for the sustainable use of bio-resources, th us enabling people to gain both environmental and socio-economical benefits via bio diversity conservation and sustainable use. For these purposes, it is necessary to improve the legal, human, institutional, scientific, technical, and financial capacity for the conservat ion and sustainable use of biodiversity, and also to raise public awareness and understanding of the CBD, thus ensuring that all the people will participate in biodiversity conservation and i ts sustainable use in a manner of masters. 4.2 Specific goals and targets The specific targets and objectives for biodiversit y conservation and sustainable use in DPRK are as follows. Goal 1: Establish national nature reserve network system, comprehensive protected area networks Objective: By 2010, the size of protected areas is increased to 8% of the territory (at present 7.2%) and a comprehensive protected area ne twork system established in a far- sighted-way with a linkage to national nature reser ve network system. 1) Rearrangement of existing protected areas to im prove capacity and effectiveness. Site-based protected area management plan is in pla ce to establish appropriate institutions and to complete management systems. In particular, the infrastructure of comprehensive conservation and management at the areas of Mts. Kumgang, Chilbo, Chail and Oga, o f key importance in biodiversity conservation, is reinforced. Protected area management personnel should be re-ed ucated to enhance their leading role in biodiversity conservation. National system is established to enable regular re source survey and effective monitoring of protected areas. 2) Establishment of new nature reserves in areas o f great significance in the biodiversity National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 73 conservation. By 2010, the size of protected areas is increased t o 8% of the territory by improving the management and conservation of nature reserves and establishing new protected areas and management system in key areas in biodive rsity conservation, in consideration of possibility to increase to 10%. 3) Establishment of a comprehensive national conse rvation network with its centre on nature reserve system It is important to establish the national network c onnecting nature reserves via ecological corridor. National network is planned, designed and establish ed in harmonious connection, via ecological corridors, between nature reserves and v arious types of environmentally- friendly forests including scenic forest, windbreak forest, bank-protecting forest and field-protecting forest) Goal 2: Strengthen the conservation of threatened s pecies, animals and plants of economic value and genetic resources Historically, the Korean peninsula in the northeast Asia has played an important role in the immigration and exchange of plants and animals. Now it is situated on the East Asia- Australia flyway, one of the 8 global flyways of mi gratory birds. In this context, the first and foremost priority sh ould be given to the conservation of universally threatened species (threatened bird spe cies, large/medium-size endangered mammals like tiger, panther, bear and otter) and en demic plant rupicola and Kumkangsania asiatica ), and the conservation of medicinal herb resources for tradit ional medicine. In particular, it is necessary to further survey an d monitoring of status of threatened species and to make an effort to conserve natural h abitats perfectly and remove and/or mitigate factors of threats. The capacity and role of ex-situ conservation facil ities (botanical garden, arboretum, medicinal herb garden, zoological garden and aquari um) for the conservation of threatened and economic species should be enhanced. It is also important to return and reintroduce into original habitats threatened and economic species multiplied by ex-situ conservation, focusing on plants including Taxus cuspidate and Stewartia pseudo- camellia conservation of genetic resources of crops, dom estic animals and micro-organisms should be further strengthened, with its special at tention to indigenous genetic resources of our country (like Kaesong Panax ginseng , Pungsan dog). It requires the establishment and effective applica tion of the national database of species National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 74 and genetic resources. Monitoring and control should be enhanced to ensure that relevant national and international laws and regulations are strictly obs erved in trade with wild flora and fauna in accordance with the international conventions. Goal 3: Establish a system for sustainable use of b iodiversity components. It is urgent to establish systems for sustainable u se of biodiversity components in various industrial fields such as forestry, agriculture, fi shery, traditional medicine and tourism, in which socio-economic activities are based on the va lue of biodiversity components. Recent economic difficulties have caused considerab le deforestation which is the main factor of soil degradation and water resource defic iency. In this context, the quantitative increase of bio-r esources, its effective, reasonable and sustainable use, and the comprehensive solution to the rural energy problem are vital for ecological security and sustainable development of the national economy. It is, therefore, necessary to: - For forestry Promote afforestation to restore degraded forests and halt forest destruction; Maintain the capacity of forest ecosystem to deliver goods and services and support livelihoods; - For agriculture Conduct the conservation of soil biodiversity and agro-bio diversity to protect agricultural eco-environment; Develop the organic farming, both indigenous and ecologica lly-friendly, ensuring high and stable harvest yield; - For fishery Give priority to the conservation of inland water and co astal area ecosystem biodiversity; Develop the cultivating fishery and fish farming, to satis fy increasing demands on aquatic products; - For traditional medicine materials Promote the creation, conservation and management of medici nal herb resources so as to meet the increasing demands in s ustainable way; - For recreation and tourism Increase significantly public awareness and understanding o f the importance of biodiversity; Maintain and improve the status and service of the ecosystems in recrea tion and tourist centres and scenic spots; - For sustainable solution to the rural energy proble m National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 75 Considering that the destruction of eco-environment in rural areas is caused mainly by the lack of energy, Towards the comprehensive system and processes for rural area energy supply and further sustainable development of rural economy, Increase firewood forest creation and the productio n of renewable energy such as methane gas, hydraulic power, wind and solar ene rgy and bio-fuel; Reduce the consumption of biomass fuels via the dev elopment and application of fuel-saving oven; this improving the people's living standard and pro moting the biodiversity conservation. Goal 4: Manage forest, inland water and coastal are a ecosystems in comprehensive and sustainable ways In consideration of topographical and meteorologica l conditions of the country with over 80% of the territory covered by mountainous areas, its drainage network very dense and the most precipitation converged during July-August, it is necessary to: Improve fundamentally the catchment area management and pr event the soil degradation and water loss; Promote the agro-forestry management at the deforested hil locks and afforestation of steep slopes, to halt soil loss and prevent natu ral calamities; Plant the protective forests for riverside and lakeside extensively and actively conserve the inland water ecosystem biodiversity by applying nature-friendly construction methods on small rivers and streams; Prevent the deterioration of coastal area and wet land eco system and establish comprehensive development and management system, to effectively conserve the biodiversity in coasts and wetlands; Control the threat from invasive alien species to ecosyste ms; Establish the comprehensive management system adaptable to e cosystem, the ecosystem approach, establish the early warning system of natural calamities and give precedence to the integral ecosystem monitoring sy stem and environmental impact assessment (EIA) of construction and develop ment. Goal 5: Prevent impacts of environmental pollution on biodiversity For further mitigating and reducing impacts of envi ronmental pollution on biodiversity, it is necessary to: Further strengthen national regulations and controls on environmental pollution; Introduce clean production technologies and ecological techn iques into the national National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 76 economy; Strictly prevent the effluence and discharge of pollutants into nat ure; Promote the reclamation and recycling of organic wastes; Actively promote the forestation and gardening in the urban and rur al areas, the infrastructure construction for sewage treatment an d waste disposal, and the improvement of eco-environment in towns and village s. Goal 6: Create, disseminate and generalize demonst rations of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use Biodiversity conservation and sustainable use could be ensured only by voluntary and conscious activities of broad masses. The most effective ways of promoting public partici pation is to: Create and extensively generalize demonstrations of the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, in many aspects (i ncluding the management of nature reserves and its vicinity, forestation and s ustainable management, agro- forestry complex management, organic farming and co mprehensive solution to rural energy problems), at various levels (family, ri, county); Encourage prudent introduction of foreign experiences in con formity with actual situations of the country. Goal 7: Strengthen scientific research on conserva tion and sustainable use of biodiversity Scientific research is an important way for the suc cessful promotion of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use. It is necessary t o: Promote the general investigative study on the type, featu re, function and value of ecosystem, as well as changes in its status, and th e monitoring and assessment of biodiversity, technology development for the restor ation of degraded ecosystem, and the sustainable use of biodiversity components; Encourage the continuous introduction of advanced technologi es such as satellite information analysis and GIS; Develop the EIA of economic activities, including construc tion and development, and ecological techniques to mitigate their impacts ; Intensify research on the prevention of the threats, inter alia , from invasive alien species and on the bio-security of GMOs; Closely combine the research on the forestry, agriculture and fish ery with practices related to use of bio-resources so as to contribute to its sustainable use, and Further strengthen the international joint study on the biodiversity conservation and National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 77 sustainable use and substantially improve the trans fer of advanced technology. Goal 8: Strengthen communication, education and tr aining on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity For improving biodiversity conservation and sustain able use, it is necessary to: Promote mass communication activities for public awareness of and general participation in the conservation and sustainable u se of biodiversity; Actively promote public communication in various forms and diverse ways, i.e. on the occasion of several commemoration periods and t he period of general mobilization for land development, and by means of all sorts of mass media (newspaper, TV, etc.); Enhance the school education on biodiversity at primary an d middle school stages and encourage the extracurricular activities for be tter understanding of the nature; Manufacture and disseminate various types of educational multimedia products i n accordance with each stage of education on the cons ervation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and substantially improve the re-educ ation of the teachers of biology and geography at primary and middle schools; Raise the level of education on environment and biodiver sity significantly at universities and colleges of education, science and technology, and also train a wealth of talents with profound expertise and pract ical ability in the land management, environmental management and sustainabl e use of biodiversity; Strengthen the vocational education aimed at improving the qu alification of the protected area and forest rangers, and the re-train ing and social education of the state officials, inter alia engaged in the bio-resource development. Goal 9: Integrate biodiversity conservation into t he Masterplan for Land Development (MLD) and other sectoral plans of natio nal economy It is important to: Integrate biodiversity concerns into the Masterplan of Land Development (MLD), comprehensive national plan related to land, resour ces and environment, to significantly promote the conservation and sustaina ble use of biodiversity at various levels (state, province, city and county), thus enabling to obtain environmental and socio-economical benefits and con tribute to improving the local economy and people's livelihood; Integrate the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversi ty closely into relevant sectoral plans of the national economy (forestry, a griculture, fishery...), and in this regard, to take comprehensive approaches in support of the implementation of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 78 objectives via setting the objectives and identifyi ng priorities from the stage of planning as to ensure the biodiversity conservation and sustainable use and to integrate priorities into national plans. Goal 10: Expand International exchange & cooperatio n for biodiversity conservation Followings will be helpful to promote biodiversity conservation and sustainable use and implement the Convention: Making active efforts to implement the CBD and its relate d conventions, FCCC and CCD, and to promote the conservation and sustainabl e use of biodiversity as required by the conventions; Further strengthening the South-South cooperation for biodiversity conse rvation and regional cooperation including agreements betwe en neighbouring countries for the conservation of migratory birds; Further promoting the multilateral exchange & cooperation and the pr udent transfer of advanced technology to DPR Korea, to significant ly contribute to the biodiversity conservation at global and/or regional levels. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 79 Chapter 5 National Biodiversity Action Plan of DPR Korea 5.1 Principles of Biodiversity Action Plan The principles of the National Biodiversity Action Plan of DPR Korea are as follows: To reinforce national laws and regulations related to biodiversity and ensure the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in accordance with the political requirement of the construction of self-supporting national economy; To promote the conservation of forest, inland water , coastal and marine ecosystem biodiversity and to enhance the functions and services of ecosystem so as to get more environmental and socio-economic ben efits; To encourage the close combination of the conservat ion and reasonable use of biodiversity and thus contribute to the sustainable economic development; To attach great importance to the main or priority activities, while developing and generalizing their models; To fully respect the requirements of the CBD and fu lfil international obligations and responsibilities. 5.2 Action plan 5.2.1 Actions for conservation Action 1: Identify and monitor the components of bi odiversity important for its conservation and sustainable use Proper establishment of the system and process to i dentify and monitor the biodiversity components important for its conservation and susta inable use is still of great significance for the biodiversity conservation in DPR Korea. It is a lso a major content of Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. In view of the physiographical conditions of DPR Ko rea, the forest, inland water, coastal, wetland and agricultural biodiversity are particula rly important areas for biodiversity conservation as well as essential substances for th e Millennium ecosystem assessment. For the sound identification and monitoring, listin g, assessing and monitoring the biodiversity of forest, inland water, coastal, wetl and and agricultural ecosystems are conducted at regional levels by using national indi cators. In particular, it is imperative to list and identify the activities by indices which have o r are likely to have significant adverse National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 80 impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity of pertinent areas, and assess and systematically monitor those impacts. Active application of the remote sensing (RS) and G IS will be encouraged for the identification of and monitoring on ecosystem diver sity. As for the species diversity, enhanced monitoring w ill be done on threatened, key, alien, protected and indicator species. Biodiversity monitoring system in DPR Korea with sm all territory should be established in harmony with early warning system of natural cal amity so as to minimize the economic loss thereby. Based on the identification and monitoring, more ef fective legislative measures and public awareness programs will be conducted to esta blish a comprehensive management system for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Action 2: Promote the conservation of ecosystem and habitat biodiversity Conservation of ecosystem and habitat is the most v ital for biodiversity conservation. Key point of ecosystem and habitat conservation is the establishment of protected areas and protected area system. For DPR Korea, of importance is to improve the mana gement quality of already established protected areas that has stretched 7.25 % of the whole territory since 2003. Site-based biodiversity objectives for each protect ed area will be identified, corresponding management institutions and regulatio ns be established and legal control and protective management be improved. Restoration of the recently degraded ecosystems wil l be encouraged. Bio-resource management in the protected areas and their vicinit y should be improved in respect to the high population density of the country. With this v iew, education & public awareness will be enhanced, and the model of participatory management of protected area will be created and generalized, where reserve's industry will be found while local residents will obtain eco- environmental and socio-economic benefits from rese rve. Acreage of protected area is intended to be enlarge d to 10% of the whole territory of DPR Korea. Action 3: Strengthen the conservation of species di versity Special attention should be paid to the conservatio n of the threatened species of worldwide significance in DPR Korea. In considerati on of the position of DPR Korea located on the East Asia-Australia flyway, one of 8 major g lobal flyways of migratory birds, the conservation of global threatened species including cranes and Platelea minor which migrate via this flyway will be improved. The list of threa tened species (Red Data Book) will be National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 81 continuously supplemented and their status will be substantially improved. In consideration of the topographical condition of DPR Korea where 80% of the territory is mountainous, the species and habitat conservatio n of threatened and valuable species in forest will be promoted. Of great importance herein are to stop habitat fragmentation, conserve forest biodiversity, and improve habitat q uality. Public awareness on the conservation of species div ersity will continuously enhanced and the conservation of threatened and valuable species will be converted into participatory work. Restoration of animal and plant species to the natu re, in particular of threatened and economic ones propagated through ex-situ conservati on, will be performed, where relevant scientific and technological problems are solved an d its model will be developed and disseminated. Wildlife trade will be conducted strictly as requir ed by national laws and regulations, especially the trade of threatened species as requi red by the international agreements on trade of endangered species including CITES, so as to mak e no impact on species diversity conservation. Action 4: Strengthen the conservation of genetic di versity Conservation of the genetic diversity of wild and c ultivated/bred plant and animal species of socio-economical value is very important both fo r biodiversity conservation and for economic development of the country. As to wild animal and plant species, assessment wil l be performed on the relations between viability of endangered species and genetic diversity in DPR Korea and between size and survival probability of populations, and on the basis of it, appropriate conservation measures will be designed and implemented. As to cultivated/bred plant, livestock, aquatic org anisms and micro-organism of economic value, identification and management of th eir genetic resources will be improved and strengthened. Enough measures will be taken to conserve genetic d iversity of bio-species and fully exert its capacity. Particularly, genetic assessmen t will be performed on population viability and minimum viable population. Proper framework for the collection, storage, regen eration, recording, information system, improvement and exchange of genetic resource will b e established and the work of halting genetic resource loss in the nature will closely be integrated to in-situ and ex-situ conservation. Traditional knowledge that has been accumulated for a long historic period of time will be protected. Special attention will be paid to bio-safety and th e function and role of current bio-safety system will continuously be enhanced National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 82 Action 5: Build up ex-situ conservation capacity Facilities and their sound operation for ex-situ co nservation of animal, plant and micro- organism are of great significance for biodiversity conservation. It is very important for DPR Korea who has already a certain capacity of ex-situ conservation to build up the capacity and enhance f unction and role. For ex-situ conservation of wildlife, of importance is the role of botanical and zoological gardens and arboreta. In this context, facilities for building up the con servation capacity of threatened species will be expanded, a genealogical registration syste m will be set up for major threatened species, and the conservation, breeding and cultiva tion techniques for them will be developed. Capacity building for ex-situ conservation for plan t and micro-organism is of great significance for the development of bio-technology and moreover the national economy. In this regard, the conservation mode from seed, in-vi tro, pollen, and in-vivo conservation will wisely be selected in accordance with the character istics of the species, and the capacity of conservation facility will be enhanced. Setting-up the database and information system rela ted to ex-situ conservation will be promoted so as to facilitate their sound use by sci entists, technicians and producers. 5.2.2 Actions for sustainable use Action 6: Improve the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in forestry, agriculture, fishery and Koryo medicine, and reduce unsustainable consumption of bio-resources Active creation, conservation and sustainable use o f biological resources by the main sectors of national economy that have intensive use of bio-resource, such as forestry, agriculture, fishery and Koryo medicine (traditiona l Korean medicine), are essential in meeting the demand for bio-products and sound prote ction of the eco-environment of the country. They are also closely related to the susta inable development of national economy and the improvement of people's livelihood, in particul ar at rural areas. In DPR Korea, socio-economic activities have alread y been performed under the national policy that intends to develop the national and loc al economy and improve the people's livelihood by making effective use of mountain in m ountainous area and sea in coastal area. From the viewpoint of biodiversity conservation, th ese activities have close relation with the conservation of forest, agricultural coastal an d inland water biodiversity. In the forestry sector, intensive measures will be taken on reforestation of degraded forests, transformation of forest of low productivi ty into one of high productivity, increase in total quantity and improvement in quality of forest bio-resources, strict adherence to cyclic National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 83 felling and sustainable forest management. In this regard, followings will be performed: to prevent and mitigate the negative impacts of mai n threats on forest biodiversity by means of reforestation, improvement of basin manage ment, creation of firewood forest and establishment/management of protected ar ea; to provide institutional and socio-economic environ ment for the conservation and sustainable use of forest biodiversity; to establish assessment/monitoring system on forest biodiversity, including designating at least 30% area of productive forest as protected area; to ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits ar ising out of the use of forest genetic resources; to apply ecosystem approach to forest management, a nd create and generalize models of sustainable management, in close relation with reducing unsustainable consumption of forest resources, e.g. over-felling of firewood forest and with continuously increasing the public awareness of the importance of forest biodiversity In the fishery sector, giving top priority to the c onservation of inland water and coastal biodiversity, more intensive activities of converti ng fishery mode from spending to breeding and culturing will be executed so as to meet the ne ed of fishery product while improving fundamentally waters eco-environment. In the agricultural sector, special attention will be paid to the conservation of agricultural biodiversity, while soundly meeting the demand of n ational economy on agricultural products. With this view, agricultural economy will in overal l be activated in the way that pressure of agriculture on environment will be decreased whi le maximizing agricultural product and improving livelihood of farmers. In this context, i ntegrated agricultural system will be hopeful where seed treatment, soil management, nutrition ad ministration and insect & disease control will be collectively promoted, capacity of rural en ergy will be built up, rural eco-environment conserving, organic farming will be expanded etc. Responsible attention will be paid to the conservat ion of agricultural genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from the use of agricultural genetic resources. In the Koryo medicine production sector, promoting the creation and conservation of mountain medicinal herb resources, capacity buildin g will be conducted on the in-situ and ex- situ conservation system for genetic resource of medici nal plant. Both production per area and quality will be raised for meeting the increasing n eed of Koryo medicine resources indispensable for public health. By encouraging artificial propagation of medicinal animal resource, its need will be soundly met and field collection in the nature will be adjusted and controlled. In the biological resource-consuming industrial sec tors, the system for sustainable use of National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 84 bio-resources based on their reproductive capacity should firmly be established to reduce the unsustainable consumption and waste of bio-resource s. Action 7: Encourage sustainable recreation and tour ism, inter alia eco- tourism Recreation and tourism, inter alia eco-tourism, play significant role in satisfying t he demand for public health and cultural & emotional l ife of people, and in increasing public awareness of the conservation and sustainable use o f biodiversity. Recreation and eco-tourism are also considered to c ontribute significantly to the local economy development and bring great profits to loca l community in pertinent areas. In this regard, enhanced education and public aware ness of the value of and benefits from biodiversity will be provided by making effective u se of recreation and tourism facilities currently available in DPR Korea. A guide for sustainable eco-tourism suited for dome stic conditions of DPR Korea will be prepared and indigenous specialities peculiar to sc enic spots will be developed and commercialized, the benefits from which will furnis h with funds to local economy development and ecosystem management. Action 8: Recover degraded ecosystems and halt habi tat loss Afforestation should be integrated with indigenous species-centred forestation and the recovery of degraded forest by means of succession. Since the deterioration of forest ecosystem is exerting adverse impact on the biodive rsity of inland water, coastal and agricultural ecosystems, forest recovery is one of the top-priorities for biodiversity conservation. In this regard, destruction of eco-environment shou ld be halted and ecosystem recovery techniques to achieve ecological equilibrium should actively be developed and transferred. In the recovery of forest ecosystem, priority order will be identified for catchment area management including inland water ecosystems on the basis of integrated survey and assessment on the catchment area. Plan for land use in catchment area will be prepared and examples for sustainable use of water and soil reso urces, pollution prevention and monitoring systems & processes in catchment areas will be crea ted. Habitat loss will also be respected. Giving priority to improving the management of rese rves and eco-environment protective forest, national protection network will be formed, which will be composed of eco- environment protective forests and reserves connect ed with buffer zones around them and ecological corridors, so that habitat fragmentation can be halted and the function and services of ecosystem can also be exerted fully. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 85 Action 9: Promote socio-economic measures that act as incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of components of b iological diversity. Various kinds of incentive measures such as publici ty, commendation and reward for units and individuals exemplary in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity will be taken. The creation and expansion of models in which local residents are able to get both eco- environmental and socio-economic benefits from the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, esp. of biological resources will act ively be promoted. In this context, the dissemination of eco-engineeri ng that enable the synchronous creation of eco-environmental and socio-economic benefits by the integrated use of mountain, river and sea and resource recycling will be encouraged s o as to make all counties activate their local economy and improve people's life by their ow n incomes. Action 10: Control threats from invasive alien spec ies Overall assessment of alien species' impacts on bio diversity will be conducted and capacity building will be performed to prevent or c ontrol the threats from introduction and invasion of alien species is. With this view, inventory of alien species will be prepared and system will be set up to develop, expand and share the database on invasive alien species. EIA systems will be built on the introduction of al ien species, inter alia , in waters, and human and institutional capacity will also be built up. Action 11: Strengthen biodiversity-inclusive enviro nmental impact assessment (EIA) Including assessment on quality and pollution of en vironment, impact assessment of human activities such as development on the environ ment will be further strengthened. Considering the legislative base on EIA already in place, of importance is human and institutional capacity building. All units that are engaged in development and explo itation will be obliged to submit authentic report on EIA and to monitor the impacts on biodiversity even after development. In this regard, public awareness on the importance of EIA in biodiversity conservation will be encouraged. Action 12: Build up capacity in biosafety Further capacity building is needed in legal and in stitutional framework for national National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 86 biosafety and the application & approval system for biosafety which are already in place. Inspection and verification system will be set up f or alien genes contained in the seed, foodstuff and processed goods of GMOs that are intr oduced by import and via other pathways. Strict safety guarantee on the industrial use of GM Os will get ready by improving quantitative evaluation of alien genes in GMOs, ris k assessment of GMOs and supervision and control on the treatment of GMOs. Measure will be taken for improving public awarenes s on biosafety. Action 13: Cope with challenges from climate change , and pollution to biodiversity It is important to take measure for coping with cha nges of the components of biodiversity. First of all, capacity of sustainable land manageme nt will be built up. With this view, current state of land degradation w ill be assessed, scientific research to halt land degradation and recovering degraded fores t will be strengthened, through which the sustainable management of forest resource will be p romoted. Sustainable development of agriculture will be encouraged, including dissemina tion of organic Secondly, improvement will be achieved in basin man agement and in the protection of land and water resources, and enlargement in eco-en vironment protective. Next, endeavours will be given to reduce the factor s that accelerate climate change, especially the global warming in various sectors of national economy including industry, agriculture and forestry, and inter alia to diminish the to-atmosphere emission of methane gas in stockbreeding. Continuous efforts will be paid to reduce the impac t of environment pollution on biodiversity. National criteria for the control of environment po llution will strictly be obeyed. Wide application of clean production technologies i n industrial sectors will be done and a waste monitoring system will be set up on the basis of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) which assesses the potential impacts of the whole product ion process from raw material procurement, via manufacture and use, to waste treatment. Green technology and eco-engineering will actively applied, afforestation in urban and rural area will be promoted, environmentally-friend ly building and will be promoted and anti- pollution infrastructure will be rearranged to fund amentally improve the eco-environment of urban and rural area made. 5.2.3 Benefit sharing Action 14: Preserve and encourage traditional knowl edge, innovations and practices National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 87 It is of great importance for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity to preserve and encourage traditional knowledge, innov ation and practices that human has developed and maintained for a long time in various sectors including agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery, forestry and public health. To scout out and collect traditional knowledge on i ndigenous biological resources such as crops, medicinal herbs etc. as well as the genetic resources that have come down from way back of local communities and residents in accordan ce with diverse physiographical characteristics of our country are of great signifi cance not only for the activation of national tradition, but also for the development of modern s cience. Local specialities will intensively activated throu gh the preservation and encouragement of traditional knowledge, including furnishing need ed facilities and training manpower, and thus local economy will be activated and farmer's l ife will be elevated. Action 15: Ensure the fair and equitable sharing of benefits among areas and communities Local residents and communities are obtaining enorm ous benefits from biological resources, which are local in its nature. However, the quantitative assessment of these benefits is still in its infancy and so are the understandin g and awareness on the immediate and long- range benefits. In this context, promoted study and assessment will be performed on the immediate and long-range benefits of recycling bio-resources, mea sures will be taken to ensuring the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from bio-resources, a mong local residents, communities and agencies. The research on, development and in-proper-price co mmercialization of local specialities from biological resources will be encouraged and th us they will make significant contribution to earnings to individual's livelihood and local bu dgetary income. Action 16: Complete biodiversity information system and build up the capacity of CHM Information sharing is one of ways of ensuring the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. In this regard, it is indispensable to complete the biodiversity database with such information that is high in quality and rich in qua ntity. In view of the depressiveness of biodiversity-relat ed information, the database will be established in such a way that sectoral ones will b e created according to unified plan and they will further integrated at national level. It will cover a wide range of fields from species, via threatened species, genetic resources, in-situ and ex-situ conservation, ecosystem, habitat, National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 88 nature reserve, economic bio-resources and alien sp ecies, to socio-economic development and population. The creation of database will be followed by integr ating the comprehensive systems of analysis, planning, assessment and management, and ultimately resulted in a national biodiversity information network. Along with this, the capacity of CHM through which data related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity will be shared will be built up so as to fully play its effective role in the introduction and transfer of advanced t echnology. Action 17: Promote the joint development and transf er of the technologies related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity Active transfer of advanced technologies and joint development of new ones for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity ar e of great significance in reducing the waste of labour and fund, in developing economy and in enabling people to get substantial benefits for their livelihood. In this context, sharing, joint-study and joint-dev elopment of technology and technique between the institutes of developed and developing countries are the effective ways of technology transfer. DPR Korea will promote the joint study of its resea rch institution on the common objects for the conservation and sustainable use of biodive rsity with ones of neighbours like China and Russia and of other Asian countries. It will also encourage the joint research programs at global levels in close relation with UNESCO, IUBS and SCOPE. Special attention will be paid to developing the ne w technologies with national and international significance in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, e.g. effective forestation method in dry land, and to continuously developing the South-South cooperation in all fields of biodiversity conservation and sust ainable use. Action 18: Create and generalize models of the cons ervation and sustainable use of biodiversity To create models for each sector and project relate d to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity where local communities and res idents are able to get eco-environmental and socio-economic benefits is very important in pr omoting public participation in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. In this regard, nature reserves will be transformed into the utilitarian models of scientific research, education and communication, sustainable use of resource and diversified management. The model of participatory protected ar ea integrating wild animal conservation National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 89 and sustainable agriculture, around the wintering p laces of crane and breeding places of black-faced spoonbill will be created. Models for forestry, agriculture and fishery will b e encouraged to be created, propagated, disseminate and generalized with the subjects of re storation of degraded forest ecosystem, catchment area management on various scales, sustai nable forest management and agro- forestry management on the sloping land of village hillocks, organic and ecological farming, protected forest, rural energy construction, cultiv ating fishery and the creation of medicinal herb resources and its sustainable use. 5.2.4 Cross-cutting measures Action 19: Integrate biodiversity concerns into the National Economic Plan (NEP) and the Master Plan for Land Development (MPL D) R&D, expert training, institutional capacity-buildi ng, financial support and EIA concerning the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity will be integrated into the National Economic Plan (NEP) through participatory discussion processes. Plan-maker will identify obvious objectives and pri ority actions of biodiversity. Priority actions will be integrated into the sector al and cross-sectoral plans of national economy, with much consideration of their implement ation and its monitoring. The Master Plan for Land Development is a unified a nd comprehensive plan for reasonable exploitation, utilization, improvement a nd beautification of land in accordance with prospective development of national economy, p romotion of people's well-being and general improvement of economic life of the country . In this regard, the conservation of biodiversity carries great weight in planning the M PLD at national and major-local levels. The MPLD will be prepared, by means of sound link b etween several sectors in plan making stage, so reasonably that land can intention ally utilized and managed with the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity wh ile eliminating the waste of materials and funds. In preparing the land use plan, special cons ideration will be taken into the conservation of biodiversity so as to reduce the biodiversity lo ss in land construction. Action 20: Strengthen scientific research on biodiv ersity conservation and its sustainable use Investigation and development study on biodiversity should be strengthened for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. With this view, following works will be performed. Study will be enhanced on classification, distribut ion and ecology of wild fauna/flora and microorganism, structure and function of every kind of ecosystem, assessment of biodiversity National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 90 and its conservation mechanism, interrelation betwe en the components of biodiversity and monitoring and reviewing methodology, particularly on the completeness of national inventory of biodiversity. Beside basic research, development of bioengineerin g in several sectors including environment, agriculture, forestry, fishery, public health and food industry, and the development and transfer of technologies for compre hensive use and conservation of environmental resources will be strengthened. The DPR Korea will encourage the joint research and development between domestic research institutions and universities as well as w ith other countries including neighbouring ones. Action 21: Strengthen education, training and publi c propaganda on biodiversity The c education, training and public propaganda sho uld be promoted on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in order to fac ilitate the public participation thereto. DPR Korea will prepare and implement the national a ction plan for the biodiversity education at school level. With this view, it will facilitate re-qualification training for the teachers of primary and middle school, while raisin g the level of education programs on biodiversity and environment protection at higher e ducation stage. It will also promote the nature study and extracurr icular education on biodiversity at primary and middle school stages, manufacture and d isseminate various types of teaching aids related to conservation and sustainable use of biod iversity, especially multimedia products in keeping with demands of IT era and actual condition of educational institutions, and establish e-infrastructure and network for this purpose. For the social education on biodiversity, dissemination and propaganda via newspaper, television and other various publicatio ns will be strengthened. It will expand the training of experts engaged in t he conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity as well as the re-qualification traini ng of reserve rangers and bio-resource-related technicians, and public officials and management st affs. Action 22: Provide necessary financial support to the institutions related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversit y Since the conservation of the natural environment a nd animal & plant species is the prerequisite of sound ecosystem management and sust ainable development of the national economy including forestry, agriculture, fishery et c., financial support for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity is of great sig nificance for both immediate and future benefits National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 91 However, the continuous natural calamities and econ omic difficulties in recent years hindered the growth of investment and financial sup port. In this regard, DPR Korea will identify clear finan cial output scale for priority actions related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and take measure to cover them with national and local budget. With this view, it will let biodiversity experts, p lanning and financial experts actively support the Ministry of Finance and local administr ative organizations, while integrating a series of additional financial measures necessary f or promoting biodiversity into existing budget plan. Action 23: Improve international cooperation for th e conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity Fundamental aim of the Convention on Biological Div ersity (CBD) is the sound conservation e global ecosystem, a base of human ex istence. However, each country has sovereign rights over their own biological resource s and components of biodiversity like habitat, species and gene resources. Because of its geographical position and the format ion history of species diversity, DPR Korea is in a special position in East Asia. In this context; various types of joint research an d cooperation will be promoted in support of the implementation of the Convention at regional and international levels, including jjoint research and cooperation with Chin a for the management of the Mt. Paektu Biosphere Reserve and inland waters ecosystem of th e River Amnok, joint research and collaboration with China and Russia on the conserva tion of estuary ecosystem of the River Tumen and wetland, collaboration on the conservatio n of migratory birds with Russia, China, Japan and Southeast Asian countries. There are several conventions related to CBD, such as the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Ha bitat (Ramsar Convention, 1971), Convention on International Trade in Endangered Spe cies(CITES, 1973) and Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage(WHC, 1972) Taking into consideration the geographical conditio ns of the Korean Peninsula, on where wetlands of regional and international signif icance in the migration of birds are located, DPR Korea will pay particular attention to the inte rnational collaboration for the conservation of migratory birds and their wetland habitats and t he endangered plant & animal species of regional and global significance. 5.3 Priority actions for biodiversity conservation Priority action for the conservation and sustainabl e use of biodiversity is identified National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 92 according to the following criteria: Whether it is of national or international & region al significance for biodiversity conservation; Threatened status of ecosystem, species and their h abitat; Immediate and future benefits from the sustainable use of bio-resource; Precedence of conservation over development and the ir integration; Effect of creation and its generalization of the mo del for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; Economic effectiveness of the investment of financi al, material and manpower resources etc. 5.3.1 Priority actions for ecosystem conservation 5.3.1.1 Forest ecosystem Among the protected areas of DPR Korea, the priorit y is given to 10 reserves and nature parks of, inter alia , forest ecosystem. 1) Mt.

In addition to above-mentioned areas, the forest ecosystems of Kwanmo Peak, Chail Peak, W agal Peak and Mt. Turyu areas also belong to priority areas. 5.3.1.2 Wetland ecosystem 5 wetland ecosystems among 11 bird reserves around the estuaries and field areas of the Korean West Sea and Korean East Sea, which are loca ted on the East Asia-Australia flyway, one of the major flyways of migratory birds worldwi de, has been identified to be priority objects. 1) Estuary of River Chongchon Wetland at the estuary of River Chongchon in Mundok County, South Pyongan Province, is an important transit place for East Asian migrat ory birds. At present, it serves as a periodic habitat for 12 species among 28 globally threatened bird that dwell in DPR Korea, including Anser cygnoids, and G. monacha . 180 species of birds are observed at the estuary of River Chongchon. This area is blessed with high productivity of inve rtebrates and wetland plant. 2) Estuary of River Amnok The area around the Silk Island of Sindo County, No rth Pyongan Province, situated at the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 94 estuary of River Amnok, serves as major transit pla ce for threatened bird species including Grus About 170 species of birds are observed in this area. 3) Taedong Bay area This area, situated between Ryongyon and Ongjin cou nties, South Hwanghae Province, is major wintering place for Grus japonensis and swan, important transit site for white stork, wild geese and longbill, and main habitat for shell fish. 4) 9.18 Reservoir area The 9.18 Reservoir in Chongdan County, South Hwangh ae Province and its vicinity, in particular islands along its seashore are breeding place for Black-faced spoonbill ( Platelea minor ), globally endanged species, and major transit sit es for crane, duck, wild goose and longbill. 5) Estuary of the Tumen River The wetland of Tumen River in Rason City, North Ham gyong Province, situated in border area with Russia, is a transit site for migr atory birds including Grus japonensis , G. vipio , moorhen and swan which migrate along the coast of the Korean East Sea. And over 200 species of birds have been recorded so far. 5.3.1.3 Coastal and Marin ecosystem Among 10 coastal aquatic resource reserves, the coa stal ecosystems of Monggumpo and Ongjin areas of South Hwanghae Province, Riwon area of South Hamgyong Province, Tongchon Kangwon Province and Mts. Chilbo a nd Kumgang are given priority. Among 15 marine resource reserves, 7 areas of water s have taken of priority, including Hwangjin Bay waters in Myongchon County and Sinchan g Bay waters in Pukchong County of North Hamgyong Province; Kosong Bay waters in Ka ngwon Province, offing waters of Kangryong, Ongjin and Kwail Counties of South Hwang hae Province; offing waters of Cholsan County of North Pyongan Province. 5.3.2 Priority for the conservation of species div ersity 5.3.2.1 Plant (24 species) - Critically species Quercus neoglandulifera Celtis cordifolia Stewartia Mammals (13 species) - Critically endangered species (CR) Phanthera tigers - Endangered species (EN) Pauthera pardus Cuon alpines zibellina Felis lynx Moschus moschiferus Nemorphaedus goral 2) Critically endangered species (CR) Dryocopus jarensis Tadorna cristata species (EN) Pinodon rufozonatus Eumeces coreensis - Vulnerable species (VU) Flaphe schrenskii National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 97 Geodemys reevesii 4) Amphibians - Endangered species (EN) Hynobins keyserling - Vulnerable species (VU) Rana coreana Rana shosenica Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 98 - Vulnerable species (VU) Parnassius bremery P. nomion, etc. 5.3.3 Priorities for gene diversity conservation Followings are the traditional genetic resources th at have taken of conservation priority for crops, domestic animal, medicinal herbs, fishes , etc. 1) Crops red Anju cotton 2) Domestic animal Korean ox, Jangyon Korean ox, Saebyol sheep chicken, Daehung Ryongyon 1 1) Title: Establishment of management system and building-up management capacity of national protected areas 2) Objectives: In accordance with the increase in number and acrea ge of protected areas, to establish a management system and improve management capacity of national protected areas. 3) Justification: After entering into the CBD, DPR Korea has twice in creased the number and acreage of protected areas to 7.25% of the whole territory by the early 2007. In this context, National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 99 to establish an adequate system for the conservatio n and management of protected areas is vital. At present, the protected areas which have been est ablished long ago are provided with infrastructure for their conservation and mana gement, but not the newly established ones are properly with facilities and p ersonnel for management and consequently very weak in their management capacity . Therefore, the conservation objectives and plans wi ll be prepared, their function will be distinguished and subsequent measures for conser vation management will be taken for the protected areas newly established. Emphasis will be put on the monitoring and management of habitats and wildlife, inter alia , of threatened species, and regular assessment will be done on the effectiveness of the management measures. Besides, a series of systems will be set up for nature reserve , including systems of administrative institutions, scientific research, public propagand a and education, finance, industry construction and cooperation with local administrat ions in nature reserve, on the basis of socio-economic assessment on nature reserve. The se systems will be developed into then a regular and integrated one. 4) Activities: To identify the general targets of conservation for every protected area and prepare plan To reinforce the legislation on protected area mana gement, and monitor and supervise their implementation To establish management and scientific research ins titutions To make overall survey of resources in protected ar eas To establish protected area information system To develop models for effective management of prote cted areas To increase financial investment in the management of protected areas To establish nature management system according to the classified functions of protected areas To encourage protected area industry To assess socio-economic benefits from protected ar eas To train conservation and management personnel for protected areas 5) Implementation agency: Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP) State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) Ministry of Forestry (MOFr) 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) Ministry of Fisheries (MOF) National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 100 Cultural Relics Conservation Administration (CRCA) People's Committees at all levels 7) Period: 3 year Project 2 1) Title: Planning and designing of national system of prote cted area network 2) Objectives: To Plan and design a national system of protected a rea network in such a way that protected areas are established as node and environ mental protection forests as ecological corridor 3) Justification: DPR Korea is willing to enlarge its protected area to 10% of whole territory by the end of a next decade of years. This will have trend of improving in-situ conservation out of protected areas and of connecting nature res erves by ecological corridors to set up nationwide network of protected areas. By transforming all kinds of protection forests sca ttered outside protected areas into ecological corridors, total acreage of protected ar eas nationwide will likely to reach about 10% of the whole territory. Then DPR Korea will consequently be able to achieve the objectives of the 2010 Biodiversity Target and the Global Strategy for Pla nt Conservation (GSPC). And the whole eco-environment of the country will be improv ed and the conservation of threatened species having their habitat outside pro tected areas will be strengthened in accordance with the requirement of GSPC, while prov iding favorable condition for the conservation of traditional cultivated plants a nd domestic animals and improving the conservation of insect-pollinators and natural enemies favorable to the conservation of agricultural biodiversity as well. 4) Activities: To survey and assess the current status and trends of existing environment- protective forests, e.g. windbreak, field protectiv e, hygienic and ornamental, bank protective, and road protective forests To apply GIS techniques to positioning and designin g ecological corridors To identify type and structure of ecological corrid ors To assess regional landscape diversity by means of landscape simulation To prepare the plan and design for the national sys tem of protected area network To assess the ecological environment of and socio-e conomic benefits from the national system of protected area network To integrate the plan of the national system of pro tected area network into the Master Plan for Land Development National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 101 5) Implementation agency: Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP) State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: Ministry of Forestry (MOFr) Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) 7) Period: 5 years Project 3 1) Title: Conservation and management of biodiversity in Mt. Kumgang and Mt. Chilbo Nature Parks 2) Objectives: To build up the conservation and management capacit y of these two nature parks which have great significance in the conservation o f species and landscape diversity, focusing at creating models of the comprehensive co nservation and sustainable use of their biodiversity 3) Justification: In Mt. Kumgang Nature Park, covering the area of 47 ,838 ha, there are 1,228 species of higher plants. Among them are included 112 kinds of endemic plants (about 20% of the total number), 14.4% of which are the genera of single-genus-single-species indigenous in Korea's flora. The nature park has 46 threatened species, 21.7% of which are indigenous plants, and its fauna has 258 species of vertebrates and 154 of butterflies including globally threatened species. Mt. Chilbo Nature Park, with the acreage of 27,754 ha, is also rich in landscape and species diversity. The park is known to be inhabite d by 855 species of higher plants and 274 of vertebrates. Both these nature parks have their peculiar landsca pe diversity not only nationwide, but also worldwide and rich biological diversity as well. At present, they are provided with tourism infrastructure, but having weak capaci ty at education, mass propaganda and scientific research with regard to biodiversity . In this context, to enhance the capacity of conservation and management of these na ture parks is of national, regional and global significance. 4) Activities: To assess in overall the value of the biodiversity in Mts. Kumgang and Chilbo Nature Parks To establish ecosystem observation center and regul arly monitor and study their biodiversity National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 102 To establish information systems on biodiversity To reinforce facilities for and activities of publi c propaganda To make clear functional classification of the Mt. Kumgang and Mt. Chilbo Nature Parks, and to draw up and implement the func tion-based plan for the conservation and management; To promote eco-tourism and nature park's industry 5) Implementation agency: State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP) 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: The People's Committees of Kangwon and South Hamgyo ng provinces; Management Bureau of Tourism 7) Period: 5 years Project 4 1) Title: Preparation of Wetland Action Plan and restoration of degraded wetland ecosystem 2) Objective: To create the national action plan which will serve as a guideline for the improvement of public awareness on the importance o f the conservation and sustainable use of wetland ecosystem, and for the s cientification, standardization and modernization of the conservati on and sustainable use of wetlands; To restore the wetlands which are of international significance but have been considerably degraded, on which creating and extens ively disseminating the model 3) Justification: Wetland is one of the significant natural resources indispensable for sustainable development of national economy. The ecological fun ctions and services it offers are various and enormous, including the natural disaste r prevention and biodiversity conservation, but public awareness on them is compa ratively low. For DPR Korea, which has high density of drainage a nd is surrounded with seas at its three sides, it is particularly important to improv e the management of wetland ecosystem. Moreover, the wetlands on the coast of Korean penin sula, being located on the East Asia-Australia flyway that is one of 8 global flywa ys of migratory bird, serve as important transit sites for the migratory birds. Such wetlands of global significance are under the high pressure by human's National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 103 activities, e.g. overexploitation of coastal aquati c resources. Even though there are many administrative sectors engaged in the conserva tion and use of wetlands, the inter-sectoral cooperation is not satisfactory, and a strategic plan and guideline to coordinate the conservation and sustainable use of wetland are not in place. A framework of the conservation and management of w etlands that has already been set up through the implementation of the UNEP/GEF-s upported project \"Coastal Biodiversity Management of DPRK's West Sea\" focusin g at the Mundok Migratory Bird Reserve during 2004-2006 will further be enhan ced. 4) Activities: To develop integrated system for the conservation, management and sustainable use of wetlands To study legislative aspect of the conservation and use of wetland resources To strengthen the propaganda, education and trainin g with regard to wetland ;conservation and its sustainable use To establish a comprehensive assessing and monitori ng systems on wetland To transfer appropriate technologies for the restor ation of degraded wetlands To draw up site-based management plan for migratory bird reserves To build up the livelihood capacity of residents in wetlands To prepare, publish and disseminate wetland action plan 5) Implementation agency: State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP) 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) People's Committees at provincial, municipal and co unty levels 7) Period: 5 years Project 5 1) Title: Updating of \"Red Data Book\" and capacity-building f or conservation of threatened species 2) Objective: To update the existing \"Red Data Book\" (Plant and A nimal editions); To in overall assess the priority order of threaten ed species conservation and thus build up capacity for in-situ and ex-situ conservation of threatened species; 3) Justification: \"Red Data Book\" (animal edition in 2000 and plant e dition in 2005) was prepared under the supervision of the State Academy of Scien ces (SAOS), with the support from UNESCO. It is necessary to update them in acco rdance with the changes in eco-National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 104 environment and to draw up species diversity strate gy and action plan by conducting comprehensive assessment to recheck the priority or der of protected species from the viewpoint of national and international significanc e. In this relation, DPR Korea intends: to reassess th e causes of threats to threatened species and their habitats; to evaluate the acreage of the protected area and the minimum viable population (MVP); to strengthen the research on the prevention of habitat loss and habitat diversification, on the ec ological corridor between habitats and its establishment, and on the population size a nd genetic diversity conservation; to organize the conservation allotment for priority species in ex-situ conservation facilities including botanical and zoological garde ns according to the priority order of threatened species, with actively developing techno logies for species conservation and artificial multiplication, and to make a framew ork for their return to nature. 4) Activities: To reinvestigate and reassess threatened species of plant and animal To re-identify the priority order of threatened spe cies conservation To assess the MVP of main threatened species To transfer appropriate technologies for habitat di versification To design ecological corridors between habitats To prepare, publish and disseminate the updated ver sions of \"Red Data Book\" To develop and transfer technologies for artificial propagation and cultivation of main threatened species in botanical and zoological gardens To establish a species registration system for the threatened species which are under ex-situ conservation To make plan and framework for the return of main t hreatened species to nature To reinforce the research for the return of main th reatened species to nature 5) Implementation agency: State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) Central Botanical Garden (CBG) Central Zoo (CZ) 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP) Cultural Relics Conservation Administration (CRCA) 7) Period: 8 years Project 6 1) Title: Conservation of black-faced spoonbill and crane 2) Objectives: To substantially improve the conservation of black- faced spoonbill that is a globally National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 105 threatened species and its breeding place is found so far only on the Korean Peninsula and the crane for which the Korean peninsula is an important wintering and transit place 3) Justification: DPR Korea is the breeding place of black-faced spoo nbill, one of the globally endangered species (its total number worldwide is 1 ,600). And its wintering places cover Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Red Catchment area in Vietnam and Kyushu in Japan. Up to now, its breeding places have reportedly been some uninhabited islands in the Korean West Sea (Taegam and Sogam islets in the off ing of Sonchon County, North Pyongan Province, Tok Islet in the offing of Onchon County, South Pyongan Province, and Ryongmae and Hambak islets in the off ing of Chongdan County, South Hwanghae Province). White crane with red crest winters in the central r egion of the Korean Peninsula. White-necked crane monachus ) migrate from the breeding places in Russia and China to the wint ering places in Kyushu area of Japan via the Korean Peninsula, in which some of their flock s spend the winter. White cranes with red crest are still under critica lly endangered state due to the habitats restricted in narrow area and to the other factors like epizootic diseases. In this context, the improvement of the conservatio n and management of black-faced spoon bill's breeding places and crane's wintering places is the basic requirement for preventing the extinction of these species. The habitat conditions of black-faced spoon bill sh ould be improved and the wintering places of crane restricted in narrow area should be dispersed to original wintering places. 4) Activities: To overall resurvey the breeding places of black-fa ced spoonbill and regularly monitor and research their breeding conditions To investigate and improve the management of breedi ng places of black-faced spoonbill To re-assess the habitat conditions of wintering an d transit places of cranes in a comprehensive way To research on and implement the dispersion of whit e crane's wintering places To improve the habitat eco-environment of the areas to where the wintering places of cranes are expected be dispersed To strengthen laws and regulations for the conserva tion of black-faced spoonbill and crane To develop the models of community-participatory pr otected area management 5) Implementation agency National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 106 State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP) Cultural Relics Conservation Administration (CRCA) 7) Period: 5 years Project 7 1) Title: Site-based conservation and management of wildlife in the places close to populated rural areas 2) Objectives: To set up a participatory conservation system compa tible with the sustainable agricultural development of pertinent areas for the effective conservation of threatened wildlife species inhabiting in the vicin ity of populated rural areas 3) Justification: In DPR Korea where the population density is high, the habitats of many bird species including cranes, one of the globally threatened sp ecies, mammal species (e.g. otters), insect species in low hill areas and threatened pla nt species are located in close vicinity of populated rural area. In this context, it is urgently requested to: Create socio-economic conditions which enable to maintain and manage the regional environment inter alia the universal foundation of guaranteeing sustainable agricultural development, while increas ing public awareness on biodiversity conservation in rural areas Establish open protected areas which promote the active part icipation of local communities and residents in the site-based conserv ation of wildlife Build the comprehensive management capacity on environme nt and ecosystem in pertinent areas 4) Activities To assess the habitat status of the threatened spec ies selected nearby populated rural areas and reasons of threats To enhance propaganda, education and public awarene ss on habitat value To transfer protective bio-technologies related to the conservation and restoration of habitat To promote the introduction of organic farming to s elected rural areas To establish the foundation for sustainable agricul tural development in selected rural areas National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 107 To provide necessary financial and technical suppor t to the selected rural villages in connection with their conversion into e co-village To establish the participatory management system fo r threatened species and their habitats, and build up the capacity of villag e custodians To establish participatory monitoring system for th reatened species and their habitats To improve the livelihood capacity of residents in selected rural villages To develop and disseminate models of site-based con servation of wildlife 5) Implementation agency: Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: Ministry of Education (MOE) Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP) Cultural Relics Conservation Administration (CRCA) 7) Period: 4 years Project 8 1) Title: Capacity-building for ex-situ conservation of genetic resources 2) Objectives: To enhance the institutional, technical and human c apacity of the facilities for ex-situ conservation of genetic resources, e. g. botanical and zoological gardens, arboreta and agricultural gene banks 3) Justification: Now, the artificial propagation of threatened, ende mic and economic species is actively undertaken in botanical and zoological gar dens and arboreta, but not meeting the international requirements for species conserva tion including breed registration. And the conservation facilities for the conservatio n of genetic resources of crops, domesticated animals and microbes are small in scal e and weak especially in technical and human capacity. In this regard, the capacity-building of gene conse rvation facilities, transfer of advanced technologies, comprehensive development of theory and practice related to the effective use of genetic resources are imperati ve for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. With this view, an action plan for the capacity-bui lding of ex-situ conservation should be in place so as to facilitate the information exc hange and duty assignment among the conservation facilities scattered around the co untry, and to enhance the role of gene conservation facilities.

On December 22, 2004, the \"Law on the Management of Genetically Modified Organisms\" was adopted and subsequently the enforce ment regulations and detailed rules relative to its implementation have been prom ulgated. For the regular establishment and sound management of national biosafety system in support of the implementation of national legislati ons, the country set up the National Biosafety Management Center in September, 2005 as a focal point of biosafety- related issues. Main areas of NBMC's responsibility are: supervisio n on and control of the biosafety-related law enforcement; inspection and v erification of GMOs-containing National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 109 imports and exports; registration and/or deposit of genetic resources and GMOs possessed by institutions and enterprises; study an d preparation of biosafety-related legislation; propaganda, education and public aware ness; arrangement of qualification examinations of the personnel engaged in gene-handling. In spite of a series of successes in the general pr ocesses related to GMOs, the regular operation of NBMC is still facing many challenges. In this regard, the capacity of National Biosafety Management Centre (NBMC) should be substantially enhanced. 4) Activities: - To strengthen the supervision and control over t he enforcement of laws, regulations, detailed rules in relation to: Observation of application and approval system for genetically modified crops Marking genetically modified crops Registration and deposit of genes Observance of regulations on the grade of gene-rela ted laboratories and their handling procedures Waste treatment - To promote education, public awareness and invol vement in support of the biosafety of GMOs Installation and operation of rooms for visual-educ ation, training center and dissemination halls Installation and operation of consultation offices for facilitating public participation Publication of pamphlets and journals Manufacture of multimedia presentations Propaganda by means of various media, such as newsp aper, radio and TV - To establish inspection and verification system on GMOs Establishment of alien gene detection mechanism Detection of GMOs from food, feed and processed foo dstuff Detection of GMOs from arbores, animals and fishes 5) Implementation agency: National Biosafety Management Centre, as a subsidia ry of SAOS 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: Branch Academy of Biotechnology (BAB, a subsidiary of SAOS) Academy of Agricultural Science (AAS) Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) Quality Supervision Administration (QSA) Ministry of Education (MOE) National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 110 7) Period: 3 years Project 10 1) Title: Restoration of degraded forests and improvement of catchment area management 2) Objective: To promote the quick restoration of recently degrad ed forests and integrated it to the catchment area management so as to build up the cap acity for sustainable management of catchment areas 3) Justification: Degradation of sloping land forests, due to the top ographical conditions of DPR Korea that 80% of its whole territory is mountainou s and to the recent economic difficulties, causes subsequent soil erosion and wa ter loss, resulting in further soil desolation, adverse impact on inland water ecosyste m and the loss of natural. In this context, nationwide enlargement of tree nur series, increase in sapling production capacity and all-people campaign for for est restoration have been and are well under way. If the restoration of degraded forest is not merely restricted to artificial reforestation, but promoted in a far-sighted way and in close inte gration with the objectives of catchment area management (e.g. conservation of for est biodiversity, enhancement of water control capacity, prevention of soil degradat ion, sustainable use of sloping land, inland water ecosystem stability, mitigation of neg ative impacts on downstream areas etc.), the ecological functions and services of cat chment area forests (e.g. prevention of natural calamities, guarantee of ecological safe ty and so on) will be enhanced, while making contribution to the welfare of rural a rea residents as well. The project is aimed at raising public awareness, a ctive transfer of associated technologies so as to build up general capacity for the sustainable management of catchment areas in support of the implementation of above-mentioned objectives. 4) Activities: To plan and design multi-dimensional and mixed refo restation for the restoration of degraded forests To transfer the restoration technologies of artific ial forests corresponding to various degrees of their degradation To transfer appropriate technologies for the restor ation of natural forests To collect, classify and assess the information on catchment areas To create participatory model on the integrated man agement of catchment area To design and disseminate various types of protecti on forests for catchment area National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 111 To transfer and disseminate appropriate technologie s for sloping land management To transfer the monitoring techniques for catchment area management; To assess the eco-environmental and socio-economic benefits from the integrated management of catchment area and perform the activi ties for public awareness 5) Implementation agency: Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP) State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) Ministry of Forestry (MOFr) 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: People's Committees at provincial, municipal and co unty levels 7) Period: 10 years Project 11 1) Title: Model development for the conservation of forest bi odiversity and sustainable management of forest 2) Objectives: To create and generalize the models of sustainable forest management, so as to promote forest biodiversity conservation 3) Justification: In DPR Korea, 80% of whole territory is mountainous and 73% is forest land. Therefore, forest plays a major role in eco-safety and biodiversity conservation of the country. Unsustainable forest management accelerates the deg radation of forest land and brings about biodiversity loss. The restoration of degraded forests of 700,000 ha, sustainable management of industrial forests for lumber production (2,000,000 ha) and the management improvement of the forests belonging to cooperative farms (200,000 ha) are urgently requesting the establishment of sustainable forest management system with emphasis on the biodiversity conservation of forest ecosyste m. In this regard, followings issues should be solved: Development of criteria and indicators for sustaina ble forest management Organization of optimal production to meet the dema nd for forest products from sustainable forest management Securing the ecological sustainability including th e conservation of soil and water resources by the sustainable management of fo rest land Fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from sustainable management by public participation National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 112 Preparation of forestation plan, selection of tree species, management of forested land, development of pest & disease contro l technologies Conservation of forest resource and key & threatene d species in the important areas for biodiversity conservation 4) Activities: To enhance the education and public awareness on th e conservation of forest biodiversity and sustainable forest management To develop action plan for and guide to sustainable forest management To reinforce the scientific research on and technol ogy development for the assessment and monitoring of sustainable forest man agement To build up the sustainable management capacity of management offices of protection & industrial forests at municipal and co unty levels for sustainable forest management To develop participatory management technologies of forest and to promote fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising form them To create and disseminate the model of sustainable forest management To apply cyclic felling method and enhance producti on efficiency on the basis of conservation technology of forest resource To develop and disseminate diversified forest manag ement methods To perform consultative service for scientific and technical matters related to the sustainable forest management To prepare and implement a plan to manage at least 30% of production forest lands in accordance with the conservation of plant biodiversity 5) Implementation agency: Ministry of Forestry (MOFr) Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP) State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: People's Committees, Forest Management Offices, Ind ustrial Forest Management Offices, Rural Economy Committees at provincial, mu nicipal and county levels 7) Period: 10 years Project 12 1) Title: Dissemination of agro-forestry management 2) Objective: To develop and widely disseminate agro-forestry man agement methods corresponding to various conditions of location, ma inly centered on degraded forest lands of populated area for setting up natural reso urce management system National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 113 ecologically safe and economically beneficial 3) Justification: Most of the recently enlarged treeless land is loca ted in the vicinity of populated areas. Therefore, the prohibition of cutting and reforesta tion at forest lands of gradient over 20\u00b0, design and model development & dissemination o f agro-forestry management at sloping lands of gradient lower than 20\u00b0, which pre vents soil degradation, guarantees ecological safety and enhances soil productivity, a ccording to various conditions of location, will produce new goods and provide favora ble conditions for the promotion of livelihood of farmers and local residents, activ ation of local economy and improvement of eco-environment. In this regard, it is important to fix the structur al model of reasonable agro-forestry management corresponding to location condition by i ntensifying scientific research on it and to strengthen education and public awaren ess, inter alia for the management personnel of local economy on purpose to enhance th eir capacity. These objectives, if implemented in close combinati on with the sustainable use of biodiversity components, would be able to give birt h to various innovative plans. For example, Raised socio-economic benefits arising from agro-fo restry management can activate the site-based renewable energy development in rura l areas and consequently it will be possible to halt the degradation of forest due t o overexploitation of firewood and ensure the ecological balance and benign circle of eco-environment. 4) Activities: To fix the reasonable model of structure for agro-f orestry management and strengthen scientific research on its cultivation t echnologies To develop the methodology of participatory agro-fo restry management To strengthen the education and expert training on agro-forestry management To create models of agro-forestry management and in tensify public awareness and propaganda through them To build local officials' capacity for agro-forestr y management To assess eco-environmental and socio-economic bene fits arising from agro- forestry management To establish the system of processing technology tr ansfer, commercialization and distribution of the goods derived from agro-forestr y management 5) Implementation agency: Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP) Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) Ministry of Forestry (MOFr) State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 114 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: People's Committees, Forest Management Offices, Rur al Economy Committees at provincial, municipal and county levels 7) Period: 5 years Project 13 1) Title : Dissemination of environmentally friendly farming system and conservation of agro-biodiversity 2) Objective: To promote sustainable development of agriculture, with improving agricultural eco- environment and raising farmer's income at the same time, by integrating the introduction & dissemination of organic farming bas ed on the healthy soil with the conservation of agricultural biodiversity 3) Justification: Production and distribution of organic agro-product s and green ones arising from both organic farming and eco-farming are one of imp ortant ways that make it able to obtain both ecological and socio-economical benefit s by improving environment conservation and local economy. It is also of great significance in the production of and provision people with agro- products high in nutrition and safety. In order to produce the organic and unpolluted agro -products aiming at environment conservation, safety and health, the assessment on and creation of production environment, establishment of production process in conformity with technical criteria of production and test & verification and so on should meet the international requirements. Organic farming needs ecological balance and divers ity, nutrition circulation and sound soil fertility, and should be closely integra ted with the conservation of agro- biodiversity. The conservation of soil biodiversity is particularly important for maintaining and raising soil fertility. Besides, organic farming is related to the technolo gy transfer and public awareness on the conservation and sustainable use of agro-bio diversity, e.g. the conservation of traditional crop and livestock breeds including one s of pest & insect resistance, the conservation of natural enemies and pollinator inse cts, nutrition circulation and the safety of productivity and ecosystem etc. As the organic and green agro-products are competit ive with the advantage of overcoming the so-called \"Green Barrier\" in interna tional trade market, they are of great significance in the development of rural econ omy, in raising income and livelihood capacity of farmers and in sustainable a gricultural development.

In consideration of the repeated overexploitation o f coastal aquatic resources and stagnation of deep-sea fishery due to recent econom ic difficulties, the establishment National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 116 of a system for the conservation and sustainable us e of coastal aquatic resources is emerging as a pressing issue. In this context, the Ministry of Fishery (MOF) has concentrated on the conversion of fishery from only catching into cultivating one and achieved considerable successes in establishing and readjusting nurseries at severa l fishery units including Yanghwa Fishery Station and in creating coastal fisheries. Further expansion of the successes achieved in coas tal fishery, inter alia centered on cultivation, is very important in developing major coastal fisheries of the KES and KWS into cultivation-centered fisheries. For this purpose, it is required to; prepare comprehensive plans for coastal water devel opment so as to increase fisheries output by making full and effective use o f the biological productivity of coastal waters improve the management of coastal aquatic resource reserves in accordance with the demands of the fundamental guide related t o coastal aquatic resources conduct regular monitoring of the biodiversity of c oastal fisheries and coastal aquatic resource reserves by means of advanced tech nologies such as GIS and RS, and promptly integrate the results thereof into the practice of production and conservation 4) Activities: To survey and assess the biodiversity of major coas tal ecosystems To strengthen regulation and control on the use of coastal aquatic resources To promote the transfer of advanced technologies fo r rearing/cultivation-centered coastal fishery To create and generalize the model of rearing/culti vation-centered coastal fishery To improve the management of coastal aquatic resour ce reserves To conduct regular assessment and monitoring on coa stal fisheries and coastal aquatic resource reserves by using RS system To train technical experts in rearing/cultivation-c entered fishery To assess the impact of alien species on coastal bi odiversity 5) Implementation agency: Ministry of Fishery (MOF) 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) 7) Period: 5 years Project 15 National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 117 1) Title: Conservation and sustainable use of Koryo medicine resource of wide use 2) Objective: To set up the system for the conservation and susta inable use of Koryo medicine resource so as to satisfy the demand for it 3) Justification: In DPR Korea, there are about 900 species of medici nal plants, 170 of which are major species widely used in traditional medicine. As for the major species of medicinal plants, follo wings can be a nd soft-shelled turtle are main animal-origin medicinal materials. In case of the medicinal herbs of being used their whole part or root, priority should be given to the resource creation in consideration of the demand expected, and intensive cultivation and mountain cultivation should properl y be combined. Considering the situation that not a little of medi cinal herb resources has seriously been lost by over-exploitation due to the economic difficulty recent years, it is necessary: to conduct the resource assessment of th e whole medicinal herbs and based on it to prescribe the exact limit of resource expl oitation; to increase the kinds and production scale of cultivated medicinal plant; and to improve public awareness on the conservation and creation of medicinal plant resour ce. 4) Activities: To assess the amount of medicinal plant resources To promote the scientification and modernization of medicinal herb farms and transfer technologies associated with cultivation; To improve the management of medicinal plant resour ce reserves To enhance the conservation capacity for genetic re sources of medicinal plants To create and generalize the models of integrating the creation of mountainous medicinal plant resource to forestry management To conduct technical rehabilitation of artificial p ropagation facilities for medicinal animals To promote propaganda and dissemination on the cons ervation of medicinal plant resources National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 118 5) Implementation agency: Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) Academy of Medical Science (AMS) 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP) Ministry of Forestry (MOFr) 7) Period: 5 years Project 16 1) Title : Establishment of the bases and network of ecologi cal observation for the improvement of ecosystem management 2) Objective: To create the bases and network of ecological obser vation on forest and inland water ecosystems to perform the long-term and comprehensi ve monitoring and research on the types and environment of local ecosystems and t o improve the management of terrestrial ecosystem, and thus to secure the susta inable economic development 3) Justification: Systematic performance of the long-term and compreh ensive research and monitoring on forest and inland water ecosystems ma kes a great contribution to the conservation of forests and rivers and ecological s afety and to securing the sustainable development of local economy. At present, there are stationary observation posts set up at provincial, municipal and county levels and at large catchment area areas and a system of comprehensively analyzing the observed data from the posts and arti ficial satellite in meteorological and hydrologic sector in place. However, the comprehensive and long-term observatio n and research on the biodiversity of forest and inland water ecosystems are still in its infancy. In this context, it is necessary: To observe the changes in terrestrial ecosystems co mprising forest, river and agricultural areas, to comprehensively assess the e cological models and statistical figures obtained and to further seek th e possibility of integrating them into the network of meteorological observation; To establish the ecological observation bases for m ain forest, inland water and agricultural ecosystems; To establish the scientific early warning system on natural calamity and catchment area management system by combining vario us approaches including RS, GIS and mathematical modeling 4) Activities: National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 119 To select the ecological observation bases on fores t and inland water ecosystems and draw up the plan for their construction To build the selected eco-observation bases and rei nforce their facilities and equipments for observation and research To train the experts engaged in eco-observation bas es To ensure the normal operation of eco-observation b ases and reinforce their capacity for synthesizing, analyzing and assessing data To set up the network of eco-observation centers 5) Implementation agency: State Academy of Sciences (Branch Academies of Fore stry and Fishery Sciences) 6) Stakeholder involved in the implementation: Ministry of Land and Environment Protection (MLEP) Ministry of Forestry (MOFr) Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) Hydrometeorology Bureau 7) Period: 5 years Project 17 1) Title: Establishment of national biodiversity information system 2) Objective: To set up information system based on biodiversity- related data and analysis thereof in order to support monitoring on biodiversity, dis seminate scientific knowledge and assure inter-sectoral integration through the excha nge of the information on science and economy 3) Justification: Biodiversity-related database is in the stage of co nstruction, and the CHM has already been established with the support of the UNEP and i s in the process of capacity- building.
