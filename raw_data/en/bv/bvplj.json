It is exclusively prepared with fresh ayahuasca vine and fresh chacruna leaves, which are boiled several hours in the daytime. Nihue Rao offers a fresh, refined, and high-quality medicine. The ayahuasca vine is used to open the spiritual world and the chacruna leaves bring forth the visions within this world. When a shaman drinks the ayahuasca brew, he or she enters a medicinal state where he or she can call forth the spirits and doctors of the spirit world and connect anyone to the sacred medicine. Ayahuasca Ceremonies Ceremonies at Nihue Rao take place four times a week on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. No ceremony is held on Wednesday, so that participants can rest and integrate their experience. Weekends are also dedicated to rest and integration. Each ceremony starts at 8 p.m. Each participant comes forward individually to drink the medicine. However, participants are not required to drink ayahuasca to receive a spiritual treatment, and can simply choose to attend and enjoy the ceremony. Approximatively one hour after drinking the medicine, the full effect of the medicine experience opens and the shamans begin to sing to call good energies into the maloka.

Later in the night, each participant is called forward in front of the shaman's mat to receive a personal medicinal song, or icaro, dedicated to his or her personal healing and spiritual intentions. The shaman may also smoke natural and local tobacco or spread perfumes to complete a treatment. A ceremony generally finishes between 1 and 2 a.m. After the ceremony's close, participants may return to their rooms for sleep, or chat and talk about their experiences with others and playing music. Ayahuasca is natural plant medicine that is used to heal. Typical effects may include nausea, vomiting, or going to the bathroom. Each person is given a bucket to use at his or her disposal, and toilets are located approximately 30 feet from the ceremonial maloka. We also recommend the use of traditional shamanic tobacco, called mapacho, and/or perfumes to improve the healing experience. During the ceremony, an experienced international team of staff members and shamanic apprentices of maestro Ricardo Amaringo are available and ready to give any kind of support and help to anyone during the nightly healing process. Three days a week, after ceremony, participants gather to share ceremony and diet experiences and receive guidance from Maestro Ricardo Amaringo and/or other experienced facilitators. A professional translator who speaks Spanish and English is available during these sessions. We typically also have staff on hand who speak French. Integration Meeting At the beginning of your journey at Nihue Rao, you will have a private meeting with maestro Ricardo Amaringo to discuss your personal intentions and healing journey. Participants who stay ten days or longer will receive a traditional master medicinal plant treatment. Additionally, prior to your first ceremony, maestro Ricardo Amaringo leads a collective meeting to the grups to introduce to the shamanic world of the ayahuasca healing ceremony and answer participants' questions. Maestro Ricardo Amaringo also typically facilitates post-ceremony meetings three days a week. During these meetings, participants may share experiences and visions from the ceremony and get feedback and advice from Ricardo. Throughout your time at Nihue Rao, participants keep in touch with an experienced international team of staff members who speak English, French, and/or Spanish. You can share your experiences, ask advice, or receive individualized guidance and care at any time. All staff members are experienced and are trained by Ricardo. Medicine Plant Treatment Nihue Rao is a modern plant medicinal healing center that follows the principles and wisdom of traditional shamanic Shipibo knowledge. A journey at Nihue Rao starts with a personal meeting with Maestro Ricardo Amaringo, who prescribes a complete individualized healing process, often with a traditional medicinal plant. Purgative Plants The day before the first ceremony, participants drink a preliminary traditional remedy called a purgative. This remedy cleans the stomach and the body, frequently causing vomiting, and is necessary in order to receive the ayahuasca brew properly. It's a preparation of two traditional Shipibo medicinal plants. These plants are a lily called Azucena, which is combined with sap of a tree called Oje. Flower Bath Twice a week, we prepare a natural flower bath made with a selection of several perfumed plants. These plants clean the energetic body field and attract good energy for the ceremony and diet. The flower bath can help to attract love and luck in life. Vapor Bath For certain health conditions and strong spiritual disorders, our shaman may prescribe a powerful treatment known as a vapor or steam bath. This bath is a mixture of various traditional medicinal plants or the bark of trees that is boiled together. The vapors from the bath deeply cleanse the body and the mind. Cataplasm For local pain or certain health conditions, our shaman may prescribe a topical application of various medicinal plants. This external cataplasm may be prescribed for several days during your journey. Botanical Garden Other powerful trees or plants may also be prescribed by our Maestro. Each plant has its own particular skills and healing abilities. Some of these plants include many others.
