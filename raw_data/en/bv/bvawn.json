Kimmel Pavilion and Hassenfeld Children's Hospital-34th Street. Building these facilities from the ground up afforded a unique opportunity for us to think holistically about how creative design and advanced technologies could be leveraged to empower our faculty, staff, and medical students to attain new levels of excellence in patient-centered care. As with our Science Building, these are milestones that represent the realization of our longtime vision to achieve the best in education, research, and clinical care. Our goals for the coming decade are as ambitious as ever. They include: I ncorporating the innovations of the Kimmel Pavilion and Hassenfeld Children's Hospital into the renovation of our flagship Tisch Hospital, new medical facilities at NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn, and enhancements at NYU Winthrop Hospital and system-wide C apitalizing on the latest in information technology\u2014especially big data, predictive analytics, and telemedicine\u2014to increase the safety, quality, and accessibility of life-changing services I nvesting in medicine's future by constructing state-of-the-art research facilities for our brilliant investigators and recruits, and a cutting-edge medical education facility for our talented students This issue of Grapevine explores how our care for children, in particular, exemplifies our momentum. We profile the ways Hassen-feld Children's Hospital along with the Sala Institute for Child and Family Centered Care are redefining the field today while trailblazing physician-scientists like Theodore P . Nicolaides '01 chart a course for its future. Additionally, we debut a column focused on the impressive accomplishments of our resi-dency programs' alumni. Together, these articles make clear that NYU Langone Health's backbone is its people: alumni, faculty, staff, students, and supporters who care so much about its success\u2014a fact that was top of mind during our recent alumni reunion, where I had the pleasure of meeting many of you. Ours is a community full of inspiring individuals, and it is with great pride that we highlight some of them here. Sincerely, ROBERT I. GROSSMAN, MD THE SAUL J. FARBER DEAN AND CEOThis August, a new chapter was added to NYU School of Medicine's legacy as a pioneer in medical education. At our White Coat Ceremony, we were thrilled to announce that we are the nation's first top-ranked medical school to offer full-tuition scholarships to every student enrolled in our MD degree program. The tuition-free initiative is driven by a moral imperative to bring forth the broadest, most talented group of students to our School and to medicine while enabling all graduates to pursue their greatest passions. As peer institutions take notice of our leadership on this crucial issue, we anticipate many will follow suit.

By 2015, that number had ballooned to 24 million, largely due to the huge increase in the number of obese individuals. The tools that were available for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes were limited to urine measurements of glucose (outside a lab), insulin injec-tions, and oral agents called sulfonylureas. Metformin from a class of drugs called bigua-nides was not approved in the United States until the 1990s. The lead article in the spring issue of Grapevine called \"Igniting a Transformation\" indicated the enormous advances that have been made and are being made in our institution alone. From an understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes to multiple approaches to the treatment of obesity and the complications of diabetes including eye disease, neuropathy, kidney disease, and heart disease, NYU School of Medicine scientists are at the forefront. I have spent a lifetime treating people with diabetes, and the work of these scientists leaves me with a feeling of great optimism for the future. ALAN L. RUBIN '66 Dr. Rubin is the author of 17 medical books, including Diabetes For Dum-mies, Type 1 Diabetes For Dummies, Prediabetes For Dummies, and Diabetes Meal Planning and Nutrition For Dummies. I was very pleased to see, in the spring issue of Grapevine, that the Apple Distinguished School Award had gone to NYU School of Medicine. As mobile healthcare technology continues to advance, allowing more bedside patient engagement with clinicians, medical schools need to integrate these tools as surely as the stethoscope has been integrated for centuries. The ability of clinicians to directly show complex imaging and have instant access to the totality of their patient's data allows the patient to directly participate in his or her own care. It also reduces the number of \"let me find that out for you\" episodes, increasing patients' trust in their clinical team. The recognition of the depth of usage of these technologies in the medical education offered at NYU [School of Medicine] means we are turning out clinicians trained for the expected technologies of the future, and shows the hard work of the educational technology team at the medical school. I for one am proud of our alma mater in this area.

GROSSMAN, MD, SAUL J. FARBER DEAN AND CEONew (s) Photo: Jay BradyNYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE is now the first top-ranked medical school in the nation to offer full-tuition scholarships to all current and future students enrolled in its MD degree program. Robert I. Grossman, MD, the Saul J. Farber Dean and CEO of NYU Langone Health, announced the news to the incoming class at the White Coat Ceremony on August 16, 2018. Starting this fall, thanks to the extraordinary generosity of more than 2,500 alumni, donors, and friends, students at NYU School of Medicine no longer have to worry about overwhelming financial debt. For each of student in the MD degree program, regardless of class year, that amounts to an annual scholarship of about $55,000 and significantly re- duces the average financial debt for graduates, which was previ-ously estimated at $184,000. \"Tuition-free medical education goes beyond the merit and financial scholar-ships and debt cancellations that other academic centers have traditionally favored,\" says Rafael Rivera, MD, MBA (STERN '15), associate dean for admissions and financial aid. \"More importantly, by taking tuition off the table for all of our MD students, it sends a clear signal down-stream to all those consid-ering a career in medicine that it is now within reach of everyone\u2014regardless of their financial means.\" Grants, much like merit and financial aid, are made only after students have chosen their career path, explains Dr. Rivera, who is also an alumnus of the NYU Langone Health residency program. \"That's too late if we wish to expand the pipeline to bring forth the broadest, most talented group of students, and to give them the financial freedom to choose medicine over other careers.\" ACHIEVEMENTS Full-Tuition Scholarships for All5 | GRAPEVINE ALUMNI MAGAZINE FALL 2018Photos: Jeff GoldbergBUILDINGS IN JUNE 2018, NYU Langone opened the Helen L. and Martin S. Kimmel Pavilion\u2014one of the most technologically integrated and digitally sophisticated inpatient facilities in the United States. Set within the Kimmel Pavilion is Hassenfeld Children's Hospital\u201434th Street, a dedicated pediatric inpatient facility (see page 16). Our goal was to push the boundaries of the digital frontier,\" says Nader Mherabi, senior vice president, vice dean, and chief information officer. \"But we've been very careful not to implement technology for technology's sake. Every decision was guided by what's right and best for the people we serve. We're empowering patients with personalized, convenient, state-of-the-art tools that enhance their hospital experience before, during, and after their stay.\" These innovations, some unique to NYU Langone, were developed with input from clinicians and patients. They include a variety of applications \u2014handheld workstations for care providers, autonomous robots that transport meals and linens, and surgical navigation displays in the operating rooms, among others. But what they share is their value to patients, their families, and caregivers. \"The Kimmel Pavilion's high-tech tools support not only physicians and nurses with real-time data as they care for patients at the bedside, but also their connections with other clinicians across NYU Langone and the entire health system,\" says Paul Testa, MD, chief medical information officer and a member of the technology leadership team. Take the Clinical Mobile Companion, which is installed on 2,600 iPhones; it enables the patient's care team to access his or her medical record, monitor vital signs, review lab results, send secure text messages, receive alerts from patient monitoring devices, and scan identification bar codes on medication containers and wristbands. Even the hospital beds at Kimmel can be personalized, thanks to a host of sophisticated electronic features that enhance patient safety and comfort.

A digital medication drawer, the first of its kind to be implemented at a U.S. hospital, syncs prescriptions and dosages with the patient's electronic medical record, customizing and updating its inventory. A new full-service electronic communications system called MyWall gives patients greater access to their own records. At the touch of a screen or button, patients can get to know their care team, review test results with physicians, ask questions about their treatment plan, view educational videos, and order meals that fall within the prescribed diet. Kimmel is also a sustainable building\u2014it's on track to receive LEED Platinum certification, which signifies that it is resource efficient, uses dramatically less energy and water, and reduces green-house gas emissions. After the 2012 flooding caused by Hurricane Sandy, NYU Langone also took steps to ensure that the building would be resilient in the case of extreme weather events. Last but not least, the new spaces were planned to support patients' healing. \"We take a holistic view of creating environments of the highest quality for our patients and families,\" says Vicki Match Suna, AIA, senior vice president and vice dean for real estate development and facilities. \"The Kimmel Pavilion is designed to enhance one's connection with the environment and create a sense of engagement, comfort, and calm.

The hope is that the area's homeless population will see these murals and utilize the services at the free clinic themselves or pass on the information to people they know in need. The Rudin Fellowship in Medical Ethics and Humanities was established as a core component of the Master Scholars Program in Humanistic Medicine (MSPHM) in 2014 through a generous grant from The Louis and Rachel Rudin Foundation, Inc. The competitive program supports medical students, residents, and clinical fellows conducting innovative and creative research projects in medical humanities and biomedical ethics. Under the mentorship of expert faculty, Rudin Fellows pursue scholarship that is typically beyond the scope of traditional medical education and training, further advancing the mission of the MSPHM to promote interdisciplinary scholarship and humanistic values in medical education at NYU School of Medicine.

Novick '65, together with Cynthia Morrow and Carole Novick, shares important case studies describing policy and administrative interventions to address public health problems or events. Dr. Novick is professor emeritus at the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice. An excerpt from \"A Case Study of Ebola Containment in Nigeria Using Principles and Practices of a Public Health Emergency Center, \" by Faisal M. Shuaib and Philip F. Musa (from 21 Public Health Case Studies on Policy and Administration): In July 2014, Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian- American diplomat who had been visiting relatives in Liberia, stepped off a plane and collapsed in Lagos, Nigeria, the most populous city in Africa. Mr. Sawyer died of Ebola five days later, becoming the first [casualty] in Nigeria associated with the devastating 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. By the time of his death, Mr. Sawyer had exposed 72 people to the lethal virus. Under the circumstances, this single event could have resulted in widespread transmission of Ebola in a densely populated country but, as Dr. Thomas Frieden, Director for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the time, stated, Nigeria's \"extensive response to a single case of Ebola shows that control is possible with rapid, focused interventions.\" This case study tells the story of what happened behind the scenes of Nigeria's Ebola Emergency Operations Center (EEOC). 189th and Washington: Stories from a Wonderful Bronx Neighborhood (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2018), by Michael J. Napoliello '66, is a series of fictional narratives that capture the essence of the predominantly American-Italian neighborhood where he grew up and the wonderful people who lived there. Dr. Napoliello is president of PharmaSavant, LLC. An excerpt: The apartment building took on an orange glow in the sunset. That orange glow, per an ambitious stretch of the imagination, was somewhat reminiscent of that seen on churches in Italy. It was a nostalgic tease that escaped the awareness of all but a few of the older inhabitants of the neighborhood, whose dreams of returning to their land of birth, triumphant with dollars, were fading in concert with their tired bones and failing hearts. Koh-Do World: Rex and the Blue Planet (Lulu Publishing Services, 2018), by Steven G. Wallach '90, is a science fiction/action adventure following the escapades of a teenager and his two friends trying to save Earth from an alien invasion. Dr. Wallach is a plastic surgeon in New Y ork City. An excerpt: Rex picked up his gym bag, and the three walked toward the Great Lawn, as Sam and Zach pushed their bikes along. As usual, the park was packed with all kinds of people on the Great Lawn doing all kinds of things on such a perfect fall day. Rex felt a strange pulsation in his left forearm, something he had only felt before when something really bad was going to happen. It was never more than a slight twinge, but then again, he had never really noticed that lump until a few months ago when it started to grow. With the increase in size, the pain associated with it became more intense. He grabbed it with his right hand and tried to rub the pain away, but it wouldn't go away as easily as in the past. The winds began to pick up at a furious pace just as they made their way onto the Great Lawn, passing by people who were marking out their territory to enjoy the beautiful day. All of a sudden, the sky began to turn black, and only a few moments before there was not even a cloud in the sky. A strange eclipse of the sun began to appear, but unlike the typical solar eclipse phases that would take several hours, the sky went completely dark in just seconds. Shock and fear in their eyes appeared as they looked up, and what they figured was an unusual solar eclipse was actually a large spacecraft hovering over them. A quick burst of light came from the bottom of the spaceship\u2014and then everything went black.BOOKS New from Alumni Authors Looking for your next read? Here are a few excerpts from books recently published by our graduates.12 | NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Photo: Matthew Septimus 12 | NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE13 | GRAPEVINE ALUMNI MAGAZINE F A L L 2 0 1 8 Why Theodore Nicolaides '01, a leader in pediatric neuro-oncology, believes we can do more to fight tumors in children By Travis AdkinsPERSONAL CARE THE CHILD, A NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL, tucked a lock of her curly black hair behind her ear as Theodore Nicolaides '01 asked how she had been feeling. \"Good!\" she answered. \"Good.\" She had the alert, intent manner of an enthusiastic student eager to be called on by a teacher. Fifteen minutes before, in the waiting room, she had been wholly absorbed in a game involving a kitchen play set, bustling to serve imaginary pizza to her younger sisters and brother. After six months of treatment for thalamic malignant glioma (an aggressive, infiltrative brain tumor), so far she had responded well. To all appearances, and in her own telling, her health seemed to be as good as could be hoped\u2014yet Dr. Nicolaides, the director of the pediatric neuro-oncology program at Stephen D. Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer & Blood Disorders, heard something in her answer that concerned him. \" Why did you hesitate?\" he asked, looking at her closely. \"You said 'good,' and then hesitated before you said 'good' again. Is there something going on?\" 13 | GRAPEVINE ALUMNI MAGAZINE F A L L 2 0 1 814 | NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE His instincts were correct. Encouraged by his attention, the girl began telling him about a recent trip to a beach. Dr. Nicolaides listened patiently as she recounted the story in a breathless mix of jumbled-up facts, details, and imaginary adventures. Finally she revealed that her eyes had bothered her that day, and with a couple questions, Dr. Nicolaides determined that her prescription eye drops, which are necessary to counteract certain complications from her chemotherapy, were the source of the problem. He asked the girl and her parents a few follow-up questions, enough to be sure that the eye drops had caused only relatively minor side effects, and reassured them that he would monitor the issue carefully. Then he moved on to other questions, asking about headaches, dizziness, balance, and reciting the girl's entire recent medical history without once looking at any notes. Dr. Nicolaides has become known as an emerging leader in pediatric neuro-oncology thanks in large part to the role he's played in moving the field toward a more precise form of treatment targeting the genetic signature of an individual patient's unique tumor. His research has already yielded insights that perhaps one day soon will help bring about more personalized drugs. It's clear from watching him in the clinic that Dr. Nicolaides is equally adept at practicing a different, but no less powerful, kind of personalized medicine: the kind that involves a physician being so attuned to his patient that he can pick up on a slight hesitation in the voice of a small girl. \"Dr. Nicolaides listens carefully, asks insightful questions, and cares deeply about his patients,\" says Catherine S. Manno, MD, the Pat and John Rosenwald Professor of Pediatrics and chair of the Department of Pediatrics. Dr. Manno, along with her colleague Adam J. Ratner, MD, led the search committee that recruited Dr. Nicolaides to NYU Langone. \"He is that rare breed of pediatrician who trained in pediatric hematology-oncology and further trained in pediatric neuro-oncology. There are vanishingly few of these important pediatric physicians in the world. He possesses many capabilities that combine to make him a special doctor.\" A Pathway to Precision Medicine After graduating from NYU School of Medicine, Dr. Nicolaides stayed to complete his residency in pediatrics. While he was at the School of Medicine, he became intrigued by emerging cancer drugs, such as Gleevec (imatinib), that were much more targeted and less toxic than chemotherapy. \"When I saw that happening, I thought, wow, this is amazing,\" he says. \" All this biology that we' d learned was now being translated into a precision medicine approach to treat cancer, and that really fascinated me.\" It was then that he decided to shift his focus and become a physician scientist studying the biology of brain tumors. His studies eventually led him to investigate the MAP kinase pathway, which is important for regulating cell growth, and in particular the BRAF gene, one of the most important genes in the MAP kinase pathway. At the University of California, San Francisco, where he was an assistant professor in residence in the Division of Hematology/Oncology in the Department of Pediatrics and director of the Brain Tumor Center Preclinical Core, Dr. Nicolaides collaborated with a group that discovered that a particular BRAF mutation, BRAF V600E, was found in a wide array of pediatric brain tumors. As it happened, Dr. Nicolaides knew that a nearby drug discovery company was developing a compound to inhibit the BRAF V600E mutation in melanoma, which was showing dramatic responses. He convinced the company to grant him access to the drug to test it against brain tumor cells, which showed that in the cells that had the BRAF V600E mutation, the compound was successful. Subsequent animal model tests confirmed that in certain brain tumors with the BRAF V600E mutation, the compound delayed the growth of the tumors and improved survival\u2014but just as importantly, showed that in brain tumors without the mutation, the compound actually accelerated the growth of tumors, and shortened survival. Based on the findings, Dr. Nicolaides secured funding for a national clinical trial, which just finished the phase I stage. \"The results look very good,\" he says. \"The majority of patients had at least some benefit, meaning that their tumors either stayed stable for a long period or shrank. These are patients who traditionally would be treated by radiation or cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs that can affect hearing, weaken their immune system, and put them at an increased risk of secondary cancer like leukemia later in life, so we don't want to expose them to those risks. With this treatment, these tumors can be manageable conditions, essentially.\" Dr. Nicolaides is now studying whether treating the tumors with a combination of the compound and immunotherapy is even more effective than the compound alone. \"Dr. Nicolaides' studies on the BRAF pathway in pediatric gliomas have helped guide clinical trials and contributed to novel treatment strategies,\" says Dr. Ratner. \"The Dr. Nicolaides has become known as an emerging leader in pediatric neuro-oncology th anks in large part to the role he's played in moving the field toward a more precise form of treatment targeting the genetic signature of an individual patient's unique tumor. 15 | GRAPEVINE ALUMNI MAGAZINE F A L L 2 0 1 8 ability to translate laboratory observations to patient care and clinical trials is of enormous importance, and his experience in each of these areas makes Dr. Nicolaides an outstanding choice to lead the pediatric neuro-oncology program.\" The Next Generation of Neuro-Oncology Care Integral to an institutional commitment to expand and strengthen its brain tumor program for children and adults, Dr. Nicolaides is one of several experts specializing in neuro-oncology, including Erik P . Sulman, MD, who was recently recruited by NYU Langone Health. These new recruits will join the program's longtime leaders, including Sharon L. Gardner, MD, and Jeffrey C. Allen, MD, as well as John G. Golfinos, MD, the chair of the Department of Neurosurgery, to put NYU Langone at the forefront of rapidly emerging precision medicine developments in neuro-oncology. \"Until about 10 years ago, a pathologist would just look at a sample of a brain tumor under a microscope and say, 'This is a low-grade glioma or high-grade glioma,'\" says Dr. Nicolaides. \"They might have had five or six different tests to confirm that, but that's all they had in their arsenal. Now we can pinpoint which oncogenes are mutating and driving the growth of these tumors, and we have drugs that can interfere with those pathways. Some of them have been proven to be effective, some of them are still being tested, and some of them might be in the pipeline. We're getting that information so that we can then stratify the patient and hopefully customize the therapy in some situations.\" \"Dr. Nicolaides is a poster child for preci- sion medicine,\" says William L. Carroll, MD, Julie and Edward J. Minskoff Professor of Pediatrics, who served as the director of the Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology until recently and who was one of Dr. Nicolaides' mentors during his time as a student and resident at the School of Medicine. \"I remember him as a bright, highly motivated resident; he had a natural curiosity. He wasn't afraid to ask questions and challenge dogma. I was delighted to help recruit him back to the School of Medicine, because that's just the kind of physician scientist we were looking for to lead our neuro-oncology program.\" \"Meet them where they are\" In conversation, Dr. Nicolaides is measured and thoughtful as he speaks about his career, in the way of a wise physician who has learned to strike the difficult balance between being compassionate and being clearheaded. Pediatric neuro-oncology can be a particularly draining specialty; the children and families whom Dr. Nicolaides sees are facing the most difficult time of their lives, and their pain and fear can be overwhelming. Early in his career, Dr. Nicolaides says, there were moments when he wasn't sure he had made the right choice. \"It's devastating for the families. It's just the worst thing in the world. And, initially, I felt like I had something to do with it.\" In time, however, he came to feel that his responsibilities were a privilege, not a burden. \"It's a real privilege being a doctor in general, but in pediatric oncology, you meet a broad spectrum of people, and they are at the weakest point in their life,\" says Dr. Nicolaides. \"I'm basically the messenger who says, 'This is what's happening to your child. And these are [your child's] options.' It's always important also to let them know that there's nothing that the child did that caused this, or that the family did that caused this, because they all feel a lot of guilt. You need to meet them where they are, and help them through this process at their own level. It's the heart of medicine.\" Left: Dr. Nicolaides, the Otto and Marguerite Manley and Making Headway Foundation Assistant Professor of Pediatric Neuro-Oncology, at Dean's Honors Day on October 4, 2018.

Kimmel Pavilion\u2014a hospital within a hospital\u2014this technologically advanced, 160,000- square-foot facility has all single-patient rooms and state-of-the-art procedural and surgical services designed for children's unique needs. \"Children's services are very important to any academic medical center,\" says Robert I. Grossman, MD, the Saul J. Farber Dean and CEO of NYU Langone. \"To do them well, you need a dedicated children's hospital. The opening of our new Kimmel Pavilion and Hassenfeld Children's Hospital location is the culmination of more than a decade of planning and construction, reflecting our overall vision to grow as a world-class, patient-centered, integrated academic health system focused on quality and excellence in clinical care, education, and research.\" Hassenfeld Children's Hospital doesn't look like a typical inpatient facility. Inspired by the concept of viewing New York City through a child's eyes, each floor evokes a welcoming, lighthearted atmosphere designed to make children and their families feel safe, comfortable, and supported. For example, a 38-foot-tall Dalmatian named Spot balancing a life-sized taxi on her nose greets children and visitors at the entrance. Among Spot's tricks are lighting the cab's headlights at night and turning on its wipers in the rain. The Children's Hall hosts performances, family nights, fitness classes, talent shows, religious services, and more. \"Everyone, from doctors to nurses to support staff, is dedicated to making sure that children are put at ease, that parents' voices are heard, and that the entire family knows their children aren't just cared for, but cared about,\" says Catherine S.

Adds Susan Block Casdin, NYU Langone trustee, and the granddaughter of Sylvia Hassenfeld, \"We have the best specialists in the world, in all of their different disciplines. We've given our doctors and nurses the optimal environment to deliver outstanding care.

Their input became integral to the hospital's aesthetics and inner workings, thanks to the efforts of the Sala Institute for Child and Family Centered Care. This unique partnership among children, families, and health professionals focuses on advancing the practice of family-centered care at Hassenfeld Children's Hospital and beyond. The Sala Institute brought together members of the Sala Y outh Advisory Council and Sala Family Advisory Council to create the hospital alongside institutional leaders, architects, artists, developers, health professionals, and planners. \"Through my work on the Family Advisory Council, I saw a lot of changes in what ended up being [part of] Hassenfeld Children's Hospital, \" says Jeremy Donovan, whose son William received extensive cardiac care in the old pediatric site as an infant. \"I got a tour of the new hospital shortly before it opened. The elevator doors swept open and I started seeing the things that we had talked about for the past three years. It was very special to see it all come to life. \" Of the many Hassenfeld Children's Hospital projects that the advisory councils worked on, Donovan is especially impressed with how the MyWall interactive screen evolved. Designed by and for NYU Langone, MyWall is a unique 75-inch, 4K resolution electronic display screen that gives patients control of their environment and the ability to customize their experiences. Using a tablet, children can view entertainment at the bedside, communicate with family and friends, control their room's ambiance, and interact with their care team in real time. \"First, groups presented to us at council meetings about the design of the MyWall interface, \" Donovan says. \"As it developed, they kept coming back with questions. When we toured the new hospital and tried MyWall in real life, everything from the entertainment to video chat options lined up exactly with what we had discussed in our meetings. \" Other elements of the hospital that children and families helped to shape are wide-ranging; diverse examples include artwork selection, the process of communicating with families during surgery, gift shop design, child life programming, family presence and visitor access, security, website design and content, and furniture selection. T rudy Elbaum Gottesman, who is an honorary alumna of the School of Medicine and a trustee of NYU Langone Health, cofounded\u2014with her husband, Robert Gottesman\u2014the Sala Institute. \"It's a dream come true, \" she says, \"to finally see the space that will be here for children and families for years to come, and create an environment that's designed to give the best care. \" Sala Y outh Advisory Council members meet monthly to tell us what no one else can\u2014what it's really like to be a patient at Hassenfeld Children's Hospital.22 | NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THE PROMISE OF PEDIATRICSMEET FIRST-YEAR RESIDENTS AT SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS By Jen Swetzoff23 | GRAPEVINE ALUMNI MAGAZINE F A L L 2 0 1 8 This year, graduates from NYU School of Medicine landed residency placements at some of the country's most innovative children's hospitals. \"We've been very fortunate to have exceptionally strong students applying in pediatrics consistently over time,\" says Linda R. Tewksbury '90, associate dean for student affairs and a member of the Faculty Alumni Council. \"We're very proud of our students, who go on to top hospitals around the country, and we're thrilled to attract students to our own excellent residency program.\" Because of a shortage of pediatricians in the United States, this next generation of doctors will be critical to helping shape the future of children's healthcare. Here, in their own words, four first-year residents share their experiences and outlooks on pediatrics. Biggest challenge in pediatrics: In children's health, I think income inequality is definitely one of the biggest challenges of our time. Early exposure to stress, through adverse childhood events, can have a huge impact on physical and mental health throughout our lives. Hope for the future: I hope that I'll be able to make a big difference in the lives of my patients, and I'm interested in taking on a leadership role in improving healthcare and helping people connect with the resources they need. I'm also interested in using journalism to help communicate and advocate for patients, and bring issues to light in a way that makes people want to take action. Impact of NYU School of Medicine: I had a more circuitous path to medical school than most students, having worked as a science journalist for several years before applying. So when I was considering various programs, I emailed faculty members and administrators to ask a few questions. Even before I had finished my application, every single person I emailed at NYU wrote back to me immediately. People were so open and welcoming, and I quickly knew I wanted to be a part of this community. Brit Trogen '18 Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU Langone Health Hassenfeld Hospital at NYU Langone Health THE PROMISE OF PEDIATRICSIf you're interested in preventive medicine, then you have to be interested in pediatrics. So many chronic illnesses, like obesity and diabetes, have their roots in everyday behaviors and patterns that often begin in early childhood.\" Brit Trogen '18 Undergraduate degree: University of Alberta Hails from: Alberta, Canada24 | NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Biggest challenge in pediatrics: Poverty as a driver of disease is a huge challenge. It's very difficult to watch kids go back into an environment that you know may keep them from being well\u2014whether that's due to a lack of access to healthy foods or being in an environment where they're exposed to trauma, or whether they and their families don't have enough financial or emotional support. Hope for the future: I don't know exactly what kind of doctor I'll be yet, or where I'll practice, but I believe in finding open doors and going through them. No matter what I end up focusing on, I think part of my responsibility as a pediatrician will be advocating for better resources for children and their families. I know that's something that a lot of people who have had longer careers than I have are very passionate about and trying to address, but I hope to join those efforts. Impact of NYU School of Medicine: Being at Bellevue, in particular, was a great opportunity to see health as a human right and a public resource\u2014providing healthcare to patients of all statuses, from all five boroughs of New York City. Working with a diverse patient population of kids and their families confirmed that I was heading in the right direction with pediatrics. '' I'm one of those people who holds a baby, even for 10 seconds, and my heart explodes. It gives me so much personal satisfaction.\" Helen Stanley '18 Undergraduate degree: Georgetown University Hails from: Allentown, Pennsylvania The way that information is being disseminated and consumed is something we have to pay close attention to, as it may have potential effects on how the brains of children and adolescents are forming.\" H. Rhodes Hambrick '18 Undergraduate degree: Furman University Georgetown, Children's Hospital of PhiladelphiaBiggest challenge in pediatrics: With today's increasingly rapid pace of technological advances, it can be difficult to know how to incorporate new tools into everyday practice. With genome sequencing, for example, we're increasingly able to diagnose genetic disorders and chromosomal abnormalities. But even though we can characterize something, we may not yet understand how to treat it. That can present real challenges in communicating with patients and their families. Hope for the future: I'm still just taking it a day at a time. But my hope, every day, is to make a family or a patient's day a little bit better, to bring some light or hope into their lives. Impact of NYU School of Medicine: I met so many mentors who I hope to emulate going forward. I made connections with other students that will last for years. And I had transformational experiences, like building 3D models of a child's heart and volunteering when called at Bellevue. As a medical student, you're paired with a child who has a chronic illness. You accompany them to their appointments, and really learn more about their family's experience with disease. Biggest challenge in pediatrics: As more and more children use mobile devices from a very young age, we're seeing higher rates of depression and anxiety. I think the implications of screen time and social media use are going to present new issues in pediatrics over the next decade. Hope for the future: My hope is that, throughout the entirety of my career, I can always find ways to connect with all of my patients and their families. Even if I only see a patient for five minutes, I want to make that person and their family members feel heard, safe, and comforted. I want to help them understand what's happening. Even if we may not have a perfect cure, my goal is to provide children and their families with the most information and support available. Impact of NYU School of Medicine: I felt at home in a collegial and collaborative environment, while training with truly diverse patient populations. I met people from all over the world, providing care to patients regardless of the ability to pay. I will forever be a more empathetic doctor because of my experience at NYU. Pediatrics is so varied. Within every age range, you can see the same symptom but have a totally different differential diagnosis. That complexity is one of the things I love about this field.\" Hannah Tredway '18 Undergraduate degree: University of Utah Hails from: Gunnison, Colorado 25 | GRAPEVINE ALUMNI MAGAZI NE F A L L 2 0 1 8 H.

Dr. Zimmerman and his wife, Barbara, had a recent experience in London that resulted in an extraordinary professional opportunity. \"We were checking out of our B&B and a gentleman asked if we needed help with our luggage,\" Dr. Zimmerman says. \" As he was wearing a suit and tie, I could tell he was not a tourist. He told me he was going to a meeting at the British Museum, and I mentioned that I have lectured there on Egyptian mummies.\" The gentleman turned out to be Dr. Hani Hayajneh, dean of the faculty of archaeology and anthropology at Yarmouk University in Irbid, Jordan, and he invited the Zimmermans to visit him there. As a result of their serendipitous meeting, Dr. Zimmerman presented a keynote speech at Yarmouk University during a workshop on ancient Egyptian burial practices. He also gave a lecture to the faculty on medical practice, disease, and death in ancient Egypt, and his wife spoke to the Hijjawi faculty for engineering technology on computer science. \"We had a wonderful time,\" Dr. Zimmerman says, \"including the opportunity to visit Petra, and are looking forward to a continuing relationship with Yarmouk.\" When he's not enjoying his retirement from practice and traveling around the world, Dr. Zimmerman serves as a visiting professor at the University of Manchester, an Heard We're grateful to all the individuals, employers, and community members who share the personal and professional accomplishments of our alumni.

KIMMEL '76 A former scholarship recipient, now a nationally recognized specialist in kidney disease, pays it forward and honors his late classmate Claudia McClintock '76. PAUL L. KIMMEL '76, a nephrologist, researcher, and clinical professor of renal diseases and hypertension at George Washington University, has been supporting NYU School of Medicine for more than 35 years\u2014largely inspired by the generosity he himself received as a student. \"I will forever be grateful to NYU School of Medicine for the confidence it placed in me, \" Dr. Kimmel recalls. \"Just before I was admitted into the medical school, my father died; he was a physician who inspired me to enter the field of medicine. At a very difficult time in my life, when I was just 20 years old, NYU showed its commitment to my success, providing full financial aid through a combination of loans and scholarships. \" Dr. Kimmel's experience at the School helped put into place a meaningful career, one he has dedicated to the treatment and study of chronic kidney disease, which affects more than 20 million adults in the United States. Among his many other notable achievements, Dr. Kimmel has helped identify sleep apnea as a common complication in hemodialysis patients and conducted groundbreaking studies on HIV-immune complex renal diseases. He participated in the identification of MYH9 and APOL1, genetic susceptibility factors for renal disease, and is now involved in evaluating the clinical utility of these genetic markers. He also published a comprehensive textbook called Chronic Renal Disease (Elsevier, 2014) with Mark Rosenberg, MD. But most significant, he says, is that he has always applied what he learned at NYU School of Medicine\u2014prioritizing the care of patients\u2014and is currently focusing on how depression, anxiety, pain, and poor quality of life affect patients with chronic kidney disease. \"Dialysis was a tremendous life-saving treatment when I started my career, \" he says. \"I believe that it's one of our greatest advances over the last 50 years in clinical care. But as I've grown older, I've seen firsthand how the patient perspective is really the most important factor in chronic kidney disease. \" After completing his fellowship, Dr. Kimmel moved to Washington, D.C., where he continues to live today with his wife of 25 years, Prudence P . Kline, MD, a recently retired physician and emeritus professor at George Washington University. The couple share a passion for opera and literature\u2014interests, he says, developed during medical school thanks to the office of culture that provided students with free tickets to theater and musical performances. He is a prolific writer, having recently completed his first novel, a work of historical fiction that begins in Lvov, where both of his parents were born, during World War II. Next, he plans to write another nonfiction book on kidney disease. The School of Medicine remains vivid for Dr. Kimmel, who notes that his dear friend Claudia McClintock '76, a gastroenterologist who passed away in 2008, was a Julliard-trained pianist before beginning medical school at age 30. In her honor, Dr. Kimmel recently led an ambitious fundraising effort with his classmates to establish the Claudia McClintock Scholarship Fund.

They met as medical students through Dr . Zitrin's late wife, Charlotte Marker Zitrin '43, during a period of tremendous change for the nation at large, for medicine, and for the School. Friends even before they were physicians, the Zitrins and Dr . Witus kept in touch. Here, we share their recent reflections on their remarkable lives. PASSIONATE TROUBLEMAKER Not long before Dr. Arthur Zitrin's 100th birthday, the New York City Bar Association's Capital Punishment Committee presented him with a special award recognizing his activism against capital punishment\u2014work he began in earnest after the age of 80. The committee leader who presented his award described him\u2014admiringly\u2014as \"a highly successful, world-class troublemaker.\" Dr. Zitrin would very likely reject everything from that portrayal but troublemaker, with characteristic good humor and humility. \"I really didn't do anything remarkable,\" he says, \"except hold out longer than a lot of other people.\" His modesty is unwarranted. A passionate scholar, educator, political crusader, filmmaker, and psychiatrist, Dr. Zitrin has spent the better part of his life striving to make people think differently about the issues that should matter most to us as a society, in his view. Raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, Dr. Zitrin is a product of the City's public schools and City College of New York. After serving in the Army, which paid for his medical education, he did his residency with NYU School of Medicine; his clinical focus was with the VA Hospital. He later took a position at Bellevue as director of Psychiatry, which he held for 15 years. Outside the clinic, Dr. Zitrin was driven by a passion for debating ethical matters in medicine and science. In 1973, he cofounded the NYU School of Medicine Bioethics Colloquium and chaired it for nearly three decades. He is widely published on subjects of import to psychiatry and bioethics. Meanwhile, in the 1970s, Dr. Zitrin began to carve out a name for himself as an amateur documentary filmmaker, working alongside the late Daniel Klugherz, a professional documentarian, and winning awards for their work. Several films pay tribute to thought leaders whom Dr. Zitrin feels have had a powerful impact on healthcare; others present individuals who fought against anti-Semitism during World War II. And the remainder bear titles such as Women and Sexuality: A Century of Change, Women in Sports, and Women's Rights in the U.S. \"I suppose I am guilty,\" Dr. Zitrin says, \"of being a feminist.\" Perhaps it was this quality that first led him to his wife, Charlotte Marker Zitrin '43. They married in 1942, and had two children, Elizabeth and Richard. Following her own successful medical career, Charlotte died in 2013 at the age of 95. \"Charlotte was beautiful and brilliant,\" her husband recalls, his voice breaking slightly. She started out as a pediatrician but later switched to psychiatry, and eventually started a successful clinic dealing with phobias. Many of her original treatment protocols are in use today, or led to the development of contemporary treatments. Throughout their lives, Charlotte and Arthur made notable contributions to medicine and society. Inspired to give back to the institutions that had shaped their lives so radically, they were remarkably philanthropic: Gifts created the Charlotte Marker Zitrin Endowed Scholarship Fund at the School of Medicine, which currently supports four students a year, and endowed a chair and launched the NYU Center for Bioethics. They funded an endowed faculty chair and an endowed scholarship at City College. Dr. Zitrin won't take any praise for their generosity either. \"It's just money,\" he says. \"The point is helping people.\" 29 | GRAPEVINE ALUMNI MAGAZINE FALL 2018INTREPID PIONEER Ann Lublin Witus, who celebrated her 104th birthday in March, was always determined to do more with her life than was customary for women of her time. She wanted a family, yes, but she also wanted a career. She decided in high school to become a doctor \"because the only people who could fire you were your patients,\" she jokes. \"But really,\" she continues, \"I just wanted to help people.\" The youngest of four in the midst of the Great Depression, Dr. Witus worked odd jobs to put herself through Smith College, her income supplemented by scholarships; she served as a laboratory technician during the summers for $100 a month. Dr. Witus recalls that out of some 2,000 women at Smith, just one was African American. \"She was a year ahead of me,\" says Dr. Witus, \"and I admired her a great deal. I thought she had a lot of guts.\" Many of Dr. Witus's own life choices required similar courage and intrepidness. As a woman in medical school, she chose the challenging path of the pioneer. After graduating from Smith, she worked for several years to earn tuition for medical school. She entered NYU School of Medicine in 1939; she was one of just 10 women in a class of 120, she remembers, along with Charlotte Zitrin '43. NYU School of Medicine was generally more open to accepting women than other medical schools in the country, and its participating hospital, Bellevue, was the first to accept female interns, and the regimen was tough. By the time the first week of medical school was over, at least 10 students had dropped out, she recalls, with more to follow in subsequent years. But, she says proudly, \"all of the women made it to the end.\" In fact, they finished slightly early. With the nation at war, physicians were desperately needed\u2014both on the front lines and to fill the gaps left at home\u2014so the School agreed to accelerate her class's fourth year. \"We didn't even have time to invite our parents\" to graduation, Dr. Witus says. She completed her first year of residency in pediatrics at Bellevue. Dr. Witus notes that her options were limited. \"Surgery, anesthesiology, radiology, orthopaedics\u2014forget it. We [women] would never have been allowed to go into those higher-paying professions. But pediatrics, we could do.\" Dr. Witus had a successful career in that specialty, continuing her residency at Children's Hospital of Michigan. When she arrived in Detroit, she says, \"there were more women than men on the house staff. Boys had been called in to serve, so they accepted more women\u2014because they had to.\" She became chief resident, and later accepted a position at the hospital, where she worked for 35 years. She also taught for several decades at Wayne State University, affiliated with Children's Hospital. Dr. Witus and her husband, Carl\u2014also a pediatrician\u2014married in 1946. For the next several decades, the couple lived in greater Detroit, remaining there through times of tremendous change for that city. They had two children\u2014Ellen and Marc. Carl died in 2010. In 2003, Drs. Ann and Carl Witus made a gift to establish the Dr. Ann Lublin Scholarship Fund at NYU School of Medicine. \"I believe it is important to give back to whatever helped you in life,\" she says. \u2014Joanna Bock 30 | NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINEadjunct professor of biology at Villanova University, and a lecturer in anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania.

Previously, Dr. Sun served as CEO for Melinta Therapeutics. Before that, he was vice president at Abbott Laboratories, where he led the development and worldwide regulatory approval of the landmark HIV protease inhibitor Kaletra, and oversaw the development and approval of multiple indications for Humira. Dr. Sun also served on the FDA Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee. HERNANDO GARZON '88 , the director of emergency management and global health at Kaiser Permanente in northern California, was honored with the 2018 NYU Alumni Changemakers Award. The fall 2017 issue of Grapevine covered his notable humanitarian relief work, including after the tsunami in Sri Lanka and the Kashmir earthquake in Pakistan, and during the famine in Somalia and the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. Most recently, he joined the International Medical Corps' hurricane response team in Puerto Rico. '90 s M.

Photo: Matthew Septimus33 | GRAPEVINE ALUMNI MAGAZINE FALL 2018 CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RECENT APPOINTMENT AS PRESIDENT OF THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION. Thank you. I'm humbled to be in this position, and I intend to do everything in my power to help the medical school at this momentous time, with the in-credible tuition-free initiative that went into effect this year. YOU'VE HAD REMARKABLE SUCCESS IN YOUR CAREER AS A DERMATOLOGIST. WHAT ARE YOU PROUDEST OF? Building my own practice and just being known as a good physician\u2014as an expert in skin cancer and dermatologic surgery, and for doing beau-tiful cosmetic surgery. I also love teaching residents, and I'm proud to have received the award for Surgical Attending of the Year three times. As an im-migrant, I had a goal of helping people become financially successful. TELL ME MORE ABOUT WHAT THE IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCE HAS MEANT TO YOU. I came to Brooklyn as an Irani- an refugee with my older sister in 1979. I was 12 years old. I didn't speak any English. My parents hoped to follow within the year, but it ended up taking them four years. So my sister and I really raised each other during adolescence, along with two of our cousins who we shared an apartment with in Long Island. I had to get myself up to go to school, come home, and do my homework. I had to start working\u2014deliv-ering the newspaper, having a Penny Saver route on the weekend, being a busboy at night. I experienced the full immigrant experience\u2014trying to make a living, survive, and build a future for myself. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE? NYU School of Medicine was my first choice\u2014both because I had liked my undergradu-ate experience at NYU and because I wanted to be close to my family. By then, my parents had arrived from Iran, so I was responsible for helping them and my younger brother\u2014they had to learn the language and assimilate to the way things worked here. I remember walking into Dean Brienza's office, who was the dean of admissions at the time, and having a very frank discussion with him about my life situation. NYU was very generous to me, but I still took out loans and worked the whole time I was a medical student. HOW DID YOU DECIDE TO SPECIALIZE IN DERMATOLOGY? I initially thought I' d become a surgeon. But as one of my jobs during medical school, I start-ed working in the phototherapy unit of NYU Medical Center, an outpatient clinic that admin-istered light treatments for in-flammatory skin diseases that responded to light treatment. That's what opened my eyes to dermatology, realizing that I could help people who, despite being healthy, had a skin disease that could make them feel psychologically unhealthy. I loved that connection. Later, I also became interested in skin cancer and ultimately decided to specialize in head and neck dermatological surgery. Deep inside, I always saw myself as an artist, but I also loved science and helping people. Luckily, I could combine those passions through being a der - matologist. People tell me I was this precocious, crazy kid. I had so many goals. I was definitely scared, afraid of failing. But I had this inner voice that said, \"You can do it.\" YOU HAVE A PHILOSOPHY OF \"LESS IS MORE. \" WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU? We live in a society where, un- fortunately, aging is difficult for all of us. But we can get carried away trying to hold on to our youth. So when I go into an exam room, I pay close atten-tion to how a patient is feeling and I remind them that we can enhance one's look, but it's most important to be natural. The less you do, the better. It's important to me to connect with my patients and understand any unresolved conflicts they may be expe-riencing\u2014whether it's stress or anxiety. Our emotions can contribute to skin disease and other physical issues. They're intertwined. NOW THAT YOU'RE PRESIDENT OF THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION, WHAT ARE YOUR PRIORITIES FOR WORKING WITH YOUR FELLOW ALUMNI? It is incumbent on us as alum- ni to understand not only the challenges that students face, but the challenges that their families face in terms of getting through medical school. By helping to fulfill one person's dream, we're dramatically changing the lives of fami-lies and we're exponentially making this world a better place. I believe that when you help someone, they are going to want to help too\u2014partic-ularly in their own commu-nities\u2014and that makes a real difference. That's how things get better. WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO GIVE BACK TO NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE? My wife and I decided to give back because both of us were recipients of financial aid and scholarships. Now, being able to help other students is a phenomenal feeling. A lot of happiness comes from giving back. We've taken our two oldest sons to the scholarship dinners at NYU School of Medicine, and they're blown away when they hear what the students say as they thank the audience. For us, showing gratitude is really important.\u2014J.S.Photo: Matthew Septimus34 | NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINEHeard FRANK C. SPENCER, MD (HON '99) , professor and chair of the Department of Surgery at NYU School of Medicine from 1966 to 1998, died July 24, 2018, at 93. His work in tech-niques such as coronary ar - tery bypass grafting served as the basis for modern cardiac surgery, and what was origi-nally considered a high-risk surgery became an almost routine procedure. Under his leadership, Bellevue Hospital became a national center for open-heart surgery in the 1960s. Born in Haskell, Texas, in 1925, Dr. Spencer was the youngest freshman at North Texas State College at the age of 15 and finished college in two and a half years. He then entered Vanderbilt Univer - sity School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, and then did an internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital. He began his residency in surgery at the University of California, Los Angeles, but his training was put on hold by his service in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War. During his two years in the U.S. Navy Medical Corps, his knowledge of artery repair saved countless young soldiers from gangrene and amputation; he was honored with the Navy's Legion of Merit Award for exemplary service. He returned to his surgical training at Johns Hop-kins in 1953, and completed his residency in 1955. In addition to his contribu- tions to general cardiothoracic surgery (including reoperative surgery), surgery for congen-ital heart disease, valvular heart surgery, thoracic aneu-rysm, and experiments with artificial hearts, Dr. Spencer made education a priority. He received numerous accolades for his teaching, including twice earning the Distin-guished Teacher Award from NYU School of Medicine. Dr. Spencer was committed to getting to know his students and patients, inquiring about their family lives, hobbies, and interests, and focusing on sympathetic listening as one of a physician's primary IN MEMORIAM Our condolences to the families and friends who have recently lost loved ones.

His approach to medicine lives on in his trainees, many of whom went on to become chairs of surgical departments across the country. Throughout his career, Dr. Spencer was an advocate for surgeons and patients. He was a 54-year member of the American College of Surgeons and its president from 1990 to 1991. He also served as president of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS), and the American Surgical Association. In 2010, he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award from the AATS in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the specialty of thoracic surgery. He is survived by his daugh- ters, Dr. Elizabeth Kay Spencer Crabb and Patricia Spen-cer, and his grandchildren, Elizabeth and Adelaide. He was predeceased by his wife, Connie, and his son, Frank.

ANTHONY IMPARATO '46 , chief of vascular surgery at NYU Langone Health for more than 20 years and a longtime facul-ty member, died February 12, 2018, at 95. He was one of the first six surgeons to establish the subspecialty of vascular surgery, in 1980, and receive his board certification in it, as detailed in the book Band of Brothers\u2014Creators of Vascular Surgery. Dr. Imparato dedicat-ed much of his professional life to educating vascular surgeons around the world. A prolific teacher, speaker, and writer, he gave more than 200 invited lectures, contributed more than 170 peer-reviewed publications, and developed many training programs. In 1985, he was elected president of the Society for Vascular Sur - gery, and he served as an offi-cer in every principal vascular society in the United States as well as in many international organizations. Prior to his medical career, he served in the U.S. Naval Forces from 1943 to 1953 and was in active duty during WWII. After retiring in 1991, he continued to serve as professor emeritus and chief emeritus until his passing.

'04) , PhD, a research professor of pathology and professor emerita of microbiology and pathology at NYU School of Medicine, died April 1, 2018, at 89. Her groundbreaking dis-coveries helped pave the way for the development of the first human malaria vaccine, which was recently approved for use in Africa by the World Health Organization. From a young age, Dr. Nussenzweig knew she wanted to work on scientific research related to the prevention, cure, and treatment of diseases. As a child during WWII, she and her family fled from Austria to Brazil. She later received her MD and PhD from the Univer - sity of S\u00e3o Paulo, where she met her husband, but then emigrated again to escape a military dictatorship. \" All this was a lesson of survival that strengthened my resources and hardened my will to be a scientist,\" she told Science magazine in 2013. While she was still in medical school, Dr. Nussenzweig and her husband discovered a blue dye that could inactivate the disease-causing organism of the insect-borne Chagas dis-ease in blood for transfusion. During her career at NYU, she discovered a protein on the surface of malaria sporozoites called circumsporozoite, or CSP . She also held numerous leadership roles, including as chair of the Department of Medical and Molecular Parasi-tology for nearly 20 years; she was the first woman to chair a department at NYU School of Medicine. Dr. Nussenzweig served as a member of the Scien-tific and Technical Advisory Committee of the World Health Organization, the Pew Foundation, and the Royal Academy of Medicine of Bel-gium. She authored more than 200 peer-reviewed publica-tions and was on the editorial boards of prestigious journals including Nature and Science. In 2006, she was elected to the Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies; in 2013, she was elected to the National Academy of Sci-ence. A mentor to countless colleagues and students, and an internationally renowned leader in the study of tropical and parasitic diseases, Dr. Nussenzweig left an indelible mark on the NYU community and on the world of medical research.

Gerry Hunt Coles with L. Jay Oliva, former president of New Y ork University38 | NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE I Remember Distant Memories of Medical School BY MARTIN DUKE '54 Martin Duke, MD, FACP , attended NYU School of Medicine from 1950 to 1954. In his recent memoir, published in the spring of 2018, he reflects on his medical student years. It is now more than 60 years since I was in medical school. Most of the classes I attended and many of the people I came in contact with are increasingly difficult to remember. However, the memories I do have continue to be a source of pleasure and reflection as the years go by. An instructor in one of my labor atory sessions was Dr. Otto Loewi. It is embarrassing to say that the name of this 1936 Nobel Prize laureate, known for his discovery of the chemical transmission of nervous impulses, meant little to me at the time. I wish it had been otherwise. Lectures by Dr. Severo Ochoa and by Drs. Dickinson Richards and Andr\u00e9 Cournand, all later Nobel Prize winners, also did not carry as much weight with me as they should have, wrapped up as I was in the daily grind of keeping up with my studies in anatomy, phys-iology, biochemistry, pathol-ogy, therapeutics, and other courses, details of which have long since been forgotten. How little I really knew, and what missed opportunities these were. During my clinical rota- tion in pediatrics, I had a discussion with the chair of the Department of Pediatrics about a small boy I had seen as a patient on the wards of Bellevue Hospital. The boy had told me when I examined him that there were bugs and insects under his bed. Because he had been admit-ted to the sometimes far from clean wards of a large and old city hospital, I had accepted his account at face value. Photo courtesy of the Lillian and Clarence de la Chapelle Medical Archives at NYUThis piece has been excerpted with permission from Hektoen International, A Journal of Medical Humanities.39 | GRAPEVINE ALUMNI MAGAZINE FALL 2018 However, it was explained to me that the boy was actually experiencing visual hallu-cinations due to atropine overdose. A look under the bed indeed satisfied me that no bugs or insects were pres-ent. I had learned a valuable lesson\u2014to avoid precon-ceived ideas and biases when examining patients. While I was on the medical wards of the Third Division at Bellevue Hospital, Dr. Ludwig Eichna taught me how to use the stethoscope properly when listening to heart sounds and murmurs. I particularly remember being with him at the Thursday Night Cardiac Clinic one winter evening when we were examining an elderly Chinese gentleman together. As the patient was about to leave the room at the conclusion of the examination, I noticed Dr. Eichna reach into his pocket for some money and say, \"Eng, it is cold out. Take a taxi home tonight.\" That moment made a deep impression upon me. Kindness and consider-ation can be as important as heart sounds and murmurs in the care of patients. Dur ing the second year of medical school, I had fallen behind in my studies in pathology because of a lengthy hospital stay for severe back problems. I had failed the final exam in the course, which meant that I was faced with the possibility of having to take the second year over again. The kindness of the chief of pathology, Dr. William Von Glahn, in arranging for extra tutorial sessions and in allowing me to retake the exam\u2014this time with a successful outcome\u2014has never been forgotten. Dr. Sherwood Lawrence, the director of student health who was well known for his studies in immunology and the \"transfer\" factor, is also fondly remembered for the courtesy and consideration he always showed me when making house calls during the time I was housebound with incapacitating infectious mononucleosis. I was living alone then, and he some-times prepared a meal for me during these visits. This was a meaningful moment in my medical education, not because I ever fully came to understand the intricacies of Dr. Lawrence's research, but because I became aware of how much personal contact through a house call meant for a sick person, a message I would carry with me during my years of medical practice. I took an elective clinical clerkship at the newly opened Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, named for its founder, Dr. Howard Rusk, where I helped with the physical therapy of injured and paraplegic coal miners. Detailed group discussions were held on every patient, with each meeting attended by individuals from the many disciplines of medicine, including internists, physiat-rists, urologists, neurologists, psychiatrists, orthopedists, nurses, social workers, speech therapists, physical thera-pists, occupational therapists, and others when needed. This was truly an eye-opener for me and was an import-ant opportunity to observe the best of multidisciplinary medicine at work. Time spent courting my future wife during my third and fourth years of med-ical school was limited to weekends because of Juli's obligations during the week as a social worker and my class schedule and atten-dance at clinics. My four years at medical school ended with two lasting memories\u2014Juli and I were married on June 6, 1954, while I was still officially a medical student, and three days later I received my medical degree at graduation exercises with my wife, my parents, and my new parents-in-law in attendance. By some miracle, I had emerged as a doctor, grateful to the guardian angels that watch over and guide medical students to prevent them from doing harm to them-selves and others, and hope-ful for many more memories in the years ahead. Following his postgraduate training in medicine, pathology, and cardiology, Dr . Duke was in private practice in Manchester, Connecticut. He served as the director of medical educa-tion and chief of cardiology at the Manchester Memorial Hospital, and he also held a teaching appointment at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. He is the author of two books and more than 100 medical articles.Photo courtesy of the Lillian and Clarence de la Chapelle Medical Archives at NYUAS THE PATIENT WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE ROOM AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE EXAMINATION, I NOTICED DR.
