Dr. Esau, ND has studied acupuncture extensively during her 4 year Doctor of Naturopathy degree. She is trained in making Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnoses and to select the appropriate acupuncture points to help create balance in the body. She is certified to practice acupuncture by the Manitoba Naturopathic Association. She has successfully completed all the training required by the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine to practice acupuncture with a global understanding of how to apply the theories and diagnostic methods of TCM. What is the difference between acupuncture that a massage therapist or physiotherapist does and a naturopath does? These practitioners all use acupuncture points but naturopathic doctors have more extensive training in Traditional Chinese Medicine theory and point selection. How much time would I get with the Naturopathic Doctor? You will spend a full hour in your initial visit so that your ND can get down to the bottom of what is happening. In some cases you may need to get blood work or imaging done before arriving at a diagnosis. We take the time to listen to your concerns and your health goals. Your ND will create a health plan with you that works for you. Are Naturopaths and Homeopaths the same? No. Naturopathic doctors/ Naturopaths are trained in homeopathy and may use it as part of their practice but it is only one of many modalities they use. Naturopaths also use nutrition, traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, do physical exams, read blood work/ lab results, perform spinal manipulations, diagnose medical conditions, prescribe herbs and supplements and more. Homeopaths are trained only in homeopathy. Can my Naturopathic Doctor order a blood test for me? Yes! Naturopathic doctors can order and interpret blood work. When a ND orders blood work it is not paid for by the province like it would be from a medical doctor but your extended health plan may cover lab work. Would Dr. Erin Esau, ND prescribe pharmaceutical drugs? No. Is Naturopathic Medicine covered by insurance? Many extended health coverage plans include naturopathic medicine. Check your plan and see what your benefits are. "}
