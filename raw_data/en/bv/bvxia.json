There is the warmth of a sunbeam, the warmth of a fire, warmth of interest, warmth of heart, warmth of anger, warmth of fever, and the fiery warmth of enthusiasm! Warmth is powerful-integrating and overlapping-and a tool that our body intentionally creates during an inflammation. Anthroposophic medicine places a lot of focus on warmth because it plays such a key role in processes of transformation.

We don't have much energy, we can't do our usual activities, we need to sleep more. If we look at it from the outside\u2014say if you were looking at another person who is \"resting\"\u2014we might conclude that resting consists of not doing anything. This goes along with the saying \"Rest is rust.\" That outside view can make us think that stopping activity is bad, a loss or a waste, even make us feel guilty for slowing down. But what about from the inside? Is resting just about being lazy? No. Consider sleep. Sleep provides the primary time for repair and recovery. Instead of our energy being directed to outside activity and outside impressions, during sleep (and intentional rest), our forces are redirected inward. If we don't get sufficient rest then we may lose track of how we are doing inside.

What if this time is truthfully a deeply needed push, urging us make changes that would otherwise be inconvenient or ignored? Most of the news we hear centers around masks, quarantines, social distancing and vaccine development. Those are all outside factors, which will only influence our health from outside. What about inside factors\u2014can they make a difference? How does our soul state influence our health and our immunity?

We are all a little bit frozen in our soul (this is true whether you are experiencing summer in the Northern hemisphere or winter in the Southern hemisphere). The release of summer here in the States, which everyone longed for and hoped for during March, April and May, has never really arrived. As a collective group our summer exhale never fully \"blossomed\" or expanded or released. The natural world kept its rhythm, but that has not been true for many of the peoples of the earth. Usually when Springtime ends, school finishes, and the weather warms, everyone relaxes and softens. People go outside, go on trips, get out of the house. New ideas and new initiatives are appropriately postponed. They are forgotten for a time. It's the part of the year when, as a medical doctor, I can usually take some vacation and people hardly notice.

That fact is unusual. We generally worry about children becoming more ill with a new virus because they have not encountered it before. The seemingly continuous \"six-month-cold\" that virtually every child gets when she begins school or daycare is really the repeated process of working through one infection after another. There is a whole repertoire of respiratory viruses they have never met before. With each illness process immunity builds, and in time, the inflammatory reaction becomes brisker and the child more resilient. As adults, we are surely exposed to those same viruses and bacteria all the time, but have gained protection, gained \"experience\" around working with them. We therefore do not have the same repeated symptoms. But meeting the coronavirus seems to be different, almost opposite. No one has existing protection from this virus-that is why it is labelled as \"novel\"\u2014and yet, young age seems to be of physiologic benefit. There is something about the way younger children get sick that we should pay attention to. [Read More](/blog/breathing-in-the-time-of-a-pandemic) [](/blog/support-for-working-through-flu-treatments-which-should-help-with-coronavirus-too) [ Support for Working through Flu (treatments which should help with coronavirus, too) ](/blog/support-for-working-through-flu-treatments-which-should-help-with-coronavirus-too) There are many small things we can do to help support each other through a flu. We can collectively work to understand \"When I am sick, what is my body trying to accomplish, what does it need to do to get better?\" and then we work to support those tasks. Fever is created by the immune system to physiologically aid the process of dissolving and clearing out what has become too isolated, too stuck, too cooled in our own body. Inflammatory reactions\u2014also part of the immune system's activity\u2014work to recognize and remove those things that do not belong in us, which is why we get inflammations during infections with viruses and bacteria (even if we get a splinter in our finger). It is possible to guide and support the body to accomplish its tasks. The suggestions listed below are helpful for illnesses or influenza-type illnesses with strong fever.

Cancer is an illness that seems to magnify the importance of many of the questions and concerns that people have all of the time. It occasions extra consciousness, for we want to really be aware of what we are doing and the possible consequences. We are forced to reconsider many of the things we have previously done out of habit or convenience, and whether we should continue them or make a change. In terms of diet and cancer it is very clear that we need to choose things that support good vitality and that nourish us, and that we need to avoid things that are burdensome and depleting. Here is a brief list of several of the common themes that emerge in discussions about diet and cancer, with some introductory insights: [Read More](/blog/what-is-the-best-diet-for-cancer) [](/blog/the-therapeutic-value-of-maintenance-as-a-life-process) [ The Therapeutic Value of \"Maintenance\" as a Life Process ](/blog/the-therapeutic-value-of-maintenance-as-a-life-process) We all need to devote energy to \"maintenance.\" No, this does not refer to some kind of human 30,000-mile check, like what you might do for your car (although healthcare would be much simpler if it only required a new water pump or brake pads at certain intervals). No, we are referring to a different kind of maintenance. What is being recommended is more along the lines of taking the time to really work through what has been taken in, so that it can fully become one's own.

And for a lot of people that means diving back into stress (of course the holidays are not necessarily free from busy schedules or lots of unusual demands, either!). Stress is, however, a natural part of life, and there are aspects of our stress response that are very healthy, even life-saving in an emergency. At the same time continued chronic stress can make us really sick. There is a kind of \"waterfall\" effect that relates acute stress and physical illness. Here is one perspective that has proven to be helpful in talking to many different people about stress.

This is an important question, as there are sure a lot of people with food allergies and sensitivities right now. One logical, initial step is to work to identify what it is that is bothering you (food diaries and allergy elimination diets work well for this). Then, when you have confirmed that something is a problem you should make sure that we are not eating it in excess. Sometimes it is even necessary to eliminate it from your diet completely. This gets to be a little bit of a complicated issue because, more and more, as we eliminate certain foods from the diet (like gluten) other foods tend to take a larger part of what we take in (like corn). Blood testing for antibodies, skin testing for reactions, and muscle testing are all important tools too. But then what do you do with the information? When we take something out of our diet, does that mean we can never eat it again? [Read More](/blog/dont-wash-your-dishes-so-well) [](/blog/sensing-like-the-heart) [ Sensing Like the Heart ](/blog/sensing-like-the-heart) Feel your heart. Stop, pause for a moment and see if you can sense the rhythmic beating of your heart. It is an amazing organ because it is in constant movement, so flexible and mobile that the moment you say \"there, now it is contracting\" it has actually already started expanding, and by the time you say it is relaxing it has again started squeezing. The heart creates an tremendous organic activity\u2014it is not so much a pump as a physiologic archetype of balance\u2014faithfully and continuously working through our whole lifetime, steady, steady, steady (can you imagine carrying out the same activity for 70, 80, 90 years?), yet simultaneously so dynamic that it never really rests. Because of these dueling activities it is hard to capture the essence of the heart in a single work or image; there are too many aspects. [Read More](/blog/sensing-like-the-heart) [](/blog/working-with-fear) [ Working with Fear ](/blog/working-with-fear) There sure are a lot of things to be afraid of in the world right now. Part of that seems related to these being turbulent times, but part of it is probably because we are connected to so many things and people and places. How many pieces of news can you really digest in a day, even if it is all good news? How many pieces of news can you digest if most of them are bad? Certainly the worrisome and scary events in the world seem to get the most press so that sometimes it can feel like everything is collapsing. That makes it hard to find places to safely orient ourselves. ... [Read More](/blog/working-with-fear) [](/blog/the-integrated-care-package) [ The Integrated Care Package ](/blog/the-integrated-care-package) There are currently places in the world where large hospitals, medical clinics and retreat centers are able to offer multi-disciplinary anthroposophic care (Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden), but the current medical model and insurance programs in the U.S. do not make this possible. This is a challenging moral quandary, as participation in insurance plans immediately creates oversight and rigid expectations around the kind of medical care that is being provided. Services must meet the \"standard of care,\" or practitioners face severe scrutiny, as well as potential punitive limits on medical practice and monetary fines. For these reasons we continue to make the decision that it is better to remain outside of the insurance system, recognizing that it is limiting access but it also allows us to provide a fully individualized, holistic approach to the healing process. We would like to try to take one step towards healing that conflict.

But that is not the only place where we are being numbed into disconnection. A lot of our human authenticity is threatened by the way we connect to the outside world around us, especially the people we know and love. How do you communicate with them? How often do you feel that you have made a real connection? It's easy these days to do a lot of communicating, but not very much connecting.There is an important distinction between them\u2014we can speak, write, or text a lot, but that doesn't mean that a real connection is being built. Other times\u2014miraculously\u2014we may not need to say very much, but feel that there is really good understanding and that a deeper connection develops. Those latter experiences are more rare, but also more valuable. So how do we create a space where we can really connect?

Might seem like a strange question, as most people today are living in a world of such tremendous material abundance that it has no real historical precedent. People have never lived such complicated lives with so much stuff. There are, of course, scary times and hard situations when people do not have enough to eat or do not have a safe place to live, and unfortunately there are many places in the world right now where people are experiencing just this kind of desperation and loss. If you think about their lives very much, it is overwhelming. And sadly (but perhaps not so shockingly), it is very possible for most of us to go about daily life without giving it too much thought or too much worry. It becomes something we are aware of as a factual aspect of the news\u2014one additional piece of information. It all becomes kind of abstract. How does that happen, that we can be connected to so much of the world and disconnected from it at the same time? What has been lost? Doesn't our loss of that capacity for real connection speak to another kind of inner, moral deprivation? [Read More](/blog/artificial-sweeteners-and-what-they-do-to-our-humanity-part-1) [](/blog/inflammation-as-transformation-how-to-get-unstuck-part-2) [ Inflammation as Transformation: How to Get Unstuck? Part 2 ](/blog/inflammation-as-transformation-how-to-get-unstuck-part-2) One of the truest definitions of health that continues to prove itself over and over again is that when we get sick, our immune system can work thoroughly and efficiently so that the illness comes to a full resolution. In other words, being healthy does not mean that we never get sick (which would assume that at baseline we have some kind of perfection of physiology, and illness is always a deviation from it). That makes for a clean model, but is a very static view. We are more dynamic beings than that. At important times an illness process can actually open the door for us to transform and rebalance. Small children are particularly good at this. When they get stressed or worn down, they quickly show the world that they don't feel well (adults are not quite so honest, and we can hold out a lot longer with supports like caffeine, deadlines, duty, and yes, the fear of finally letting down...). But sick children do what their bodies need: they slow down, they lose their appetite, get a fever, whine and cling, and discharge what they don't need (with a drippy nose, loose stools, a red rash, etc). That process needs a few days, but usually children swiftly turn the corner and build back to a good appetite and full activity-often better balanced than they were before. So an essential part of health is that our body has the flexibility to loosen and shift and change to a new state as needed. [Read More](/blog/inflammation-as-transformation-how-to-get-unstuck-part-2) [](/blog/can-you-have-a-tumor-in-your-feeling-life) [ Can you have a tumor in your feeling life? ](/blog/can-you-have-a-tumor-in-your-feeling-life) There is a very unusual description of a tumor in anthroposophic medicine. It comes from some comments made by Rudolf Steiner, who helped to found anthroposophic medicine with a group of physicians about 100 years ago. It says that a tumor is a \"sense organ\"\u2014like an eye or an ear\u2014in the \"wrong place.\" That sounds very bizarre, until you start to spend some time thinking about the process, the activity of a sense organ, which is create a space where the outside world can penetrate into us, undisturbed. Our eye, or our ear, should accurately convey our surroundings without altering them. That is not the only way the outside world comes in: we breathe air, but warm and humidify it, and what we breathe in is different than what we breathe out; we take in food, but it is (necessarily) radically transformed through our digestion. Our sense impressions, however, really should come in without disruption or distortion. So our eyes, and our ears and our smell, can truly be thought of as little \"harbors\" where the outside world comes into us.

If there are gallstones, but no symptoms, in most cases leave it alone (diabetes was an exception). It was, and is, a very mechanical view of the liver and gallbladder, sort of like swapping out parts on a car engine. If it is causing problems take it out, if it is not, leave it be. And it is true that a primary activity of the gallbladder is to function as a storage sack for the gall and wait until the right kinds of foods are eaten, then send a bunch of gall down into the small intestine. But the gallbladder is more important than that. For the active excretion of the bile through the gallbladder is an essential activity of the liver, and for digestion in general. [Read More](/blog/gallstones-and-your-mood) [](/blog/where-does-anxiety-come-from) [ Where does Anxiety come from? ](/blog/where-does-anxiety-come-from) Feeling anxious? Then you probably need to reconnect your thinking with your feet. Why is that true? Well, anxiety, in all its different forms usually means that we are thinking, watching, waiting, and can't quite let go of that activity. Sometimes exaggerated sensing activity is healthy and appropriate\u2014for example, if a dog jumped out and bit your leg, then you should be extra watchful and guarded if you have to walk by that dog's house again. But if you became so worried that you never went for a walk, or find that when you do go for a walk you are still worrying about the dog long after you have arrived home, closed the door, even gotten into bed in your pajamas, then that watchfulness is no longer healthy. In a way, our nervous system gets stuck in the \"on\" position and doesn't switch off (another term for "}
