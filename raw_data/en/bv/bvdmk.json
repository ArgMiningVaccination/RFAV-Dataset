Learn the different ways to feel truly cleansed", "sitename": "Recoverlution", "date": "2022-11-24", "cleaned_text": "Addiction Recovery: Cleanse the Mind, Body & Soul Our mind, body, and spirit are all interwoven. The further into addiction recovery we go, the more apparent this becomes. As this is the case, then not only do we need to cleanse our bodies of substances when pursuing recovery, but we also need to cleanse our minds and souls as well. Addiction is complex, and treating it often requires huge transformation. Experiencing a true physical, mental, and spiritual overhaul is what leads to long-lasting recovery. It is in this space where true freedom from addiction can be found. What It Means To Feel Truly \"Clean\" In Addiction Recovery When experiencing recovery from addiction, not only does the physical body need to be cleared of substances. The mind and spirit also require a complete overhaul in order to maintain and grow in recovery. Even those struggling with process addictions, such as sex or gambling addiction, will need to undergo a mental and spiritual cleanse in order to maintain ongoing recovery. This isn't an overnight process and takes time, patience, and consistent effort. It can also look vastly different between individuals. Everyone views addiction recovery differently, and everyone has their own definition of what it means to be clean. It is truly a gift to be able to acquire clean time as the days go by. However, for some, this accomplishment simply isn't enough. For some people in recovery, being clean may mean abstaining completely from all illicit substances. For others, it can mean to be clean from all addictive prescription drugs. Others may go even further and tackle other toxins in the body such as caffeine, sugar, or [tobacco](https://www.recoverlution.com/knowledge/tops-tips-quitting-smoking). Although each person's idea of being clean is unique and based upon their own experiences and beliefs, there is a recovery programme for everyone, and no one's idea of what it means to be clean should be judged. Body Cleanse in Addiction Recovery Cleansing the body of substances is vital to a healthy recovery from addiction. Though a medical detox is recommended, there are many holistic ways to speed up the detox process and cleanse the body of drugs and alcohol. Medical Detox Programme When beginning the process of addiction recovery, you must first detox the body of problematic substances. Although eliminating substance use on your own is entirely feasible, there are some substances, such as alcohol and benzodiazepines, whose withdrawal symptoms can be fatal if not carefully monitored. For this reason, it is worth considering entering a [medical detox programme](https://www.recoverlution.com/knowledge/drug-alcohol-detox-methods) to ensure a safe and healthy cleanse of substances from the body. A medically assisted detox can help to manage your withdrawal symptoms while cleansing your body safely [1]. This is the first step in building a long, healthy recovery from addiction. Addiction Recovery Supplements When cleansing the body in early recovery, you can take over-the-counter supplements and vitamins to begin replenishing your body with nutrients. The body will be deficient in many essential vitamins and minerals after ongoing substance use, so taking supplements such as thiamin, vitamin b-12, magnesium, zinc, and multivitamins, will be highly beneficial [2]. Hydration & Exercise You can also utilize an all-natural juice cleanse or incorporate exercise into your routine in order to speed up the process of cleansing your body of toxins. Drinking tons of water whilst detoxing will also help to flush your body of unwanted toxins and chemicals. Starting and ending your day with a tall glass of water is a great first step towards increasing your daily water intake. Veganism When it comes to cleansing the body, many individuals choose to modify their dietary habits. One option for doing this is to cut out animal-based foods. Some people choose to explore a vegan diet as part of transitioning into an overall healthier and more spiritual lifestyle. This is simply one option that can help you to cleanse your body and feel more connected to the Earth around you. Mind Cleanse in Addiction Recovery Detoxing the body is only the beginning of the addiction recovery process. Just as important to overall healing is cleansing the mind. For many, drug and alcohol use is a symptom of repressed pain or unresolved traumas. Trouble coping with [challenging emotions](https://www.recoverlution.com/knowledge/emotions-impact-cravings) and difficult life events can elicit thoughts of using and lead to potential relapse, if not addressed in a healthy way. Maintaining optimal mental health is crucial in regard to relapse prevention. Whether you are struggling with drug and alcohol addiction or process addiction, the chances of maintaining long-term recovery are slim if the root causes of the addiction are not understood and worked through. Therapy for Addiction Recovery There are many ways to cleanse the mind during recovery. One option would be to attend therapy sessions, whether in the form of individual therapy or group therapy. Here, you can learn about your internal triggers for substance abuse, you can learn about your behaviours and thought processes and how to change them in a safe, non-judgmental space. Therapy is also fundamental in supporting the prevention of addiction relapse. Meditation Practising meditation is also a great way to cleanse the mind and remain grounded. Meditation practices allow you to look inward and learn more about whom you truly are. A consistent meditation practice can lead to great stillness, peace, and acceptance in your life. Research studies indicate that meditation is also a great way to increase relaxation and reduce stress [3]. Stress Reduction Activities For A Healthy Recovery Practising [stress reduction activities](https://www.recoverlution.com/knowledge/6-hacks-reduce-stress-natural-remedies), like meditation, will help keep your mind clear and calm, and will assist in maintaining your recovery. For some, this could mean going for a walk. For others, this could mean reading a book or writing in a journal. A stress reduction activity can even be something as simple as watching a funny film or rewatching your favourite Netflix series. Whether it's practising yoga or trying out a new recipe, incorporating a stress-reducing activity into your daily routine will help you maintain a healthy recovery from drugs and alcohol. Nightly Reviews Another way of maintaining a healthy mind is by practising nightly reviews, which is a practice derived from Alcoholics Anonymous. You can do this practice every night by taking inventory of how you stayed in contact with your higher power throughout the day. You can also look at how you felt during the day, how you behaved, what struggles you faced, and what barriers you may have placed between yourself and your higher power. This is also a time to practice prayer and meditation [4]. Practising Gratitude Another way of cleansing the mind is by practising gratitude. Practising gratitude daily has been shown to significantly reduce negative emotions and improve mental health [5]. When you are having a tough day or are going through a difficult time, searching for silver linings is a simple yet effective way to uplift yourself and maintain your mental well-being. Soul & Spirit Cleanse in Addiction Recovery With the body free of addictive substances and the mind clear of clutter, it is finally so important to cleanse the spirit as part of a healthy recovery from drugs and alcohol. When drowning in the depths of addiction, you may have felt numb or disconnected from yourself. On the other side of addiction, however, comes connection and transformation. Cleansing your spirit will allow you to reach new levels of healing. It will provide you with empathy, peace, love, and optimism. Meditation & Yoga One way to cleanse the spirit is to practice meditation or yoga. These ancient practices will allow you to find an internal stillness separate from the outside chaos of the world. Through meditation and [ yoga](https://www.recoverlution.com/knowledge/best-yoga-types-addiction-recovery), you will be able to access your inner knowing. These practices will propel you towards achieving even greater levels of self-awareness and conscious decision-making that will carry you through the recovery process. Holistic Practises You may also venture into the world of sage smudging, aura cleansing, or chakra cleansing via reiki. These alternative methods of healing are meant to clear your energy and increase your vibration. These methods can be used daily, weekly, or simply whenever you are feeling low or stuck, and they are a great way of cleansing your spirit and helping you to feel restored. Connecting With Others Another great way to cleanse the spirit is to spend time with the people you love. Put yourself around people who make you laugh, who make you feel good, and who you can be your authentic self around. You can also find ways to help others, whether it's in the form of volunteering or performing a random act of kindness. Connecting with others is part of our nature, and maintaining positive connections with others has a positive impact on our well-being. Our [Community ](https://www.recoverlution.com/community-landing)offers free connection and access to groups and meetings with like-minded others [6]. Spending Time in Nature Spending time in nature is another way to cleanse the spirit. The healing power of nature has been demonstrated by many research studies over the years. Working with plants and spending time in nature has the power to reduce stress, decrease symptoms of depression, and even improve immune function [7]. Whether you make a trip to the woods or beach, marvel at the greenery in your own garden, or simply purchase a plant to take care of in your flat, the benefits of connecting with nature will help you continue to experience a healthy and holistic recovery from drugs and alcohol.
