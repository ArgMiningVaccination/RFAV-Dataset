Fang, M.L.I.S. fang@library.ucsf.eduInformation Services Librarian Kalmanovitz Library and Center for Knowledge Man agement University of California, San FranciscoSan Francisco, California 94143-0840 Background : The amount of reliable information av ailable for compleme ntary and alternative medicine (CAM) is limited, and few authoritative resources are avail able. Objective : The objective is to investigate the information-seeking behavior of health professionals seeking CAM informat ion. Methods : Data were gathered using a W eb-based questionnaire made available to h ealth s ciences fa culty af\u00aeliated with the University of California, San Francisco. Results : The areas of greatest interest were herbal medicine (67%), relaxation exercises (53%), and acupuncture (52%). About half theresp ondents perceived their CAM searches as being only partially successful. Eighty-two percent rated MEDLINE as a useful resource,46% personal contacts with colleagues, 46% the W eb, 40% journals, and20% textbooks. Books and databases most frequently cited as usefulhad information about herbs. The largest group of resp ondents was in internal medicine (26%), though 15% identi\u00aeed their specialties as psychiatry, psychology, behavioral medicine, or addiction medicine. There was no correlation between specialty and patterns of information-seeking behavior. Sixty-six percent expressed an interest in learningmore about CAM resources. Conclusions: Health professionals are frequently un able to locate the CAM information they need, and the majority have little knowledge ofexisting CAM resources, relying instead on MEDLINE. Medicallibrarians need to educate health professionals in the identi\u00aecation and use of authoritative CAM resources. INTRODUCTION The National Center for Compleme ntary and Alter- native Medicine (NCCAM) de\u00aenes compleme alternative medicine (CAM) as ``a broad range ofhealing philosophies (schools of thought), approaches,and therapies that mainstream W estern (conventional)medicine does not commonly use, accept, study, un- * Preliminary results were presented at MLA 2001, the 101st Annual Meeting of the Medical Library Associat ion, Orlando, Florida; May 30, 2001.derstand, or make avail able'' [1]. CAM covers a wide range of therapies and practices popularly referred toas simply `` alternative'' or ``c ompleme ntary'' medicine. It includes acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and a host of oth-er practices. Over the past decade, use of CAM therapies by the American public has increased dramatically. This usewas brought to the attention of many health profes-sionals in the 1990s by surveys carried out by DavidEisenberg's group at the Center for Alternative Medi-cine Research and Educat ion, Beth Israel DeaconessOwen and Fang 312 J Med Libr Assoc 91(3) July 2003Medical Center [2, 3]. These studies indicated that as many as four out of ten Americans used alternativemedicine therapies, with the total number of visits toalternative medicine practit ioners ex ceeding visits to all U.S. primary care physicians [4]. Other surveyshave since con\u00aermed the continued widespread use ofCAM therapies in the United States and in other in-dustrialized W estern nations [5]. Most signi\u00aecantly, ina recent paper, Kaptchuk and Eisenberg suggestedthat the United States is witnessing a major paradigmshift in the structure of contemporary health care,where the current dominant biomedi cal-based system is being replaced by ``medical pluralism,'' in whichpeople use the rapies and practices from a variety of healing systems [6]. For both information specialists and health care pro- fessionals, \u00aending reli able information for even the more widely known areas of CAM can be a daunting task. First of all, ef\u00aecacy and safety data based on stan-dard clinical trials are signi\u00aecantly lacking, so oftenlittle published information exists in the mainstream biomedical literature. Sec ond, bibliom etric studies have shown that much CAM information is scattered in alarge number of journals, published in many languag-es [7]. Furthermore, important information can oftenonly be found in the dif\u00aecult-to-\u00aend ``gray literature,''such as trade journals, pamphlets, conference proceed-ings, and market research reports [8]. Federally fundedinstitutions such as NCCAM and the National Libraryof Medicine (NLM) have tried to remedy this by de-veloping tools that facilitate access to CAM informa- tion in the journal literature: such as CAM on PubMed,a subset of PubMed. H owever, core biomedical biblio- graphic databases such as MEDLINE still do not i ndex many journals relevant to CAM practit ioners, and cur- rently only about \u00aefty to CAM. This paucity of informationresources is re\u00afected in the 2001 Bra ndon/Hill list of books and journals, which names only seven textbooksand one journal for the w hole area of CAM [9]. A few studies have investigated physicians' experi- ence with and interest in CAM therapies [10, 11]. In a1998 paper, Curry and Smith cons a library's spective, interviewing physicians, medical st udents, and librarians to ascertain opinions on the desirabilityof adding CAM resources to a library's collection [12].Kleijnen and Knipschild compared standard onlinebiomedical databases such as MED LINE and EM- BASE SMfor information on vitamins, herbs, and ho- meopathy [13]. A study by Stone et al. compared eightdatabases for information on ``natural products'' usedas drugs and found that the European-based EMBASEdatabase contained the greatest number of relevant ci-tations [14]. These authors also searched the W eb forCAM information and noted the great variability in thequality of W eb-based CAM material [15]. H owever, there were no published studies on the informationneeds and information-seeking behavior of health pro-fessionals seeking CAM informat ion. This paper reports the \u00aendings of a W eb-based sur-vey designed to study the information-seeking behav- ior of health professionals seeking CAM informat ion. Our objective was to attempt a preliminary delineationof the relevant literature while identifying educational opportunities for librarians in CAM on the Universityof California, San Francisco (UCSF), campus. SETTING/SUBJECTSUCSF is one of nine campuses in the University of Cal- ifornia (UC) system, but the only one dedicated s olely to graduate and professional study in the health sci-ences. It includes four professional schools, in dentist-ry, medicine, nursing, and pharmacy; a graduate di-vision for predoctoral and postdoctoral s cientists; the UCSF Medical Center; and the Langley Porter Psychi-atric Institute. UCSF encompasses several sites in SanFrancisco, including UCSF Mount Zion Hospital, andmaintains partnerships with two af\u00aeliated institutions: San Francisco G eneral Hospital (SFGH) Medical Cen- ter and the V eterans Affairs Medical Center (V AMC).It also operates many clinics in the San Francisco BayArea that specialize in particular health pr oblems or are targeted to speci\u00aec groups. UCSF employs an es- timated 5,800 faculty and research staff, including anextensive network of af\u00aeliated health professionals,committed to research, patient care, educat ion, and outreach. In 1998, UCSF received a $10 million giftfrom the Bernard Osher Foundation to establish theOsher Center for Integrative Medicine (OCIM), with amission to search for the most effective treatments bycombining CAM and mainstream W estern approachesto health care. As part of its mission to educate UCSFhealth professionals in CAM, the center provided \u00ae-nancial support for this project. METHODOLOGY The survey instrument was a brief questionnaire, with thirteen si mple qu estions and write-in sections for in- dividuals to provide additional information if neces-sary (Appendix). Individual questions were formulat-ed with assistance from af\u00aeliated faculty at the OCIM.Before being distributed, the survey was reviewed andapproved by the university's Committee on HumanResearch (CHR). Individuals were given the option ofcompl eting a W eb-based questionnaire or returning a paper copy provided as a Microsoft tWord document email attachment. The sa mple population was a group of 295 UCSF-af\u00aeliated faculty, c omprising both clini- cians and researchers, who had previously self- iden- ti\u00aeed as interested in CAM. These self- identi\u00aeed in- dividuals had resp onded to a survey originally sent out to UCSF faculty in 1998 by staff at the UCSF OCIMand designed to identify individuals who were inter- ested in, or were currently using, CAM protocols andtherapies. They identi\u00aeed their status as assistant, as- sociate, adjunct, or clinical professor (58%); postdoc-toral or postgraduate researcher (8%); and res ident (6%). Only email addresses were obtained from theCAM information-seeking behavior J Med Libr Assoc 91(3) July 2003 313Figure 1 Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) areas of interest (N 5121) Note on percentage values: respondents can indicate interest in more than one area of CAM. OCIM, so individuals who c ompl eted the survey re- mained anonymous. The \u00aerst mailing\u00d0consisting of an email message with an introductory message from UCSF librarians,the uniform resource locator (URL) of the W eb-basedquestionnaire, and the Word attachment \u00aele\u00d0was sentout from the UCSF library in a batch mailing in lateSeptember 1999. A remi nder mailing was sent out in February 2000. The response to the \u00aerst two mailingswas considered low. After consultations with facultyat the OCIM, a third mailing was sent out in June 2000,this time originating from the OCIM instead of fromthe library. This mailing resulted in a much hi gher response rate, bringing the total number of returnedsurveys to 121. Results were analyzed using SPSS t10 for Windows. Basic univariate statistics, such as freq uency tables and means, were used to describe the data, and the chi-square test was used to determine correlations be-tween specialties and area of interest in CAM, typesof resources consulted, and other patterns of in for- mation-seeking behavior. Statistical results thoughwere not signi\u00aecant due to small sa mple sizes. RESULTS The survey yielded a total of 121 responses, 114 online and 7 paper-based questionnaires, giving a total re-sponse rate of 41%. Although the authors obtained ap- proximately 500 email addresses from the OCIM (i.e.,UCSF faculty expressing an interest in CAM), by thetime our survey was \u00aerst mailed out in September1999, many of these email addresses had become ob-solete, so that the \u00aenal number of distributed surveyscame to 295. Figure 1 shows the main CAM areas of interest to UCSF health s ciences fa culty. Of the thirteen types of CAM therapies listed on the survey, the area of great-est interest was herbal medicine (67%). H owever, more than half (53%) expressed interest in relaxation exer-cises (encompassing a variety of techniques used tocontrol tension and enhance relaxation), as well as acu-puncture (52%). Furthermore, more than 40% reportedan interest such as the Ornish diet(45%), biofeedback (42%), and guided imagery (42%). Other major selected were meditation (38%),movement the by about a quarter ofresp onde nts. It is important to note that resp ondents could express interest in more than one CAM modality (Appendix). A variety of more esoteric areas of CAM were cited as being of interest by a small number of resp ondents (mentioned by just one or These anthroposophical medicine (``R July 2003Figure 2 Use of CAM Information (N 5121) Note on percentage values: respondents can indicate more than one application.

As shown in Figure 2, when asked whether CAM information was sought for clinical, research, or edu-cational use, more than half (65%) indicated the in for- mation was for use in a clinical setting. Fifty-one per-cent used it in teaching, 41% for research, 36% for pre-paring publications, and 27% for preparing grant pro-posals. A small number (3 resp onde nts) indicated use of CAM information for personal health and wellness.(Note that these percentages do not add up to 100%,because resp ondents could ch oose more than one op- tion: thus some individuals might use CAM informa-tion not only for clinical decision making but also inteaching and research.) Eighty-one percent reported that they had sought CAM information within the last year, and about 53%said they did so at least once a month. Though notstatistically signi\u00aecant because of the small sa mple size, it was interesting that individuals in clinical phar-macy searched for information more frequently thanothers, doing so on a weekly basis. Similarly, respon-dents identifying their specialty as family practice,nursing, and social s cience or anthropology were the next most frequent searchers, having looked for CAMinformation at least once a month during the past year. As a preliminary step in identifying any perceived barriers to \u00aending CAM informat ion, survey respon- dents were asked ``The last time you looked for CAMinformation: (1) Approximately how much time didyou spend; and (2) Did you \u00aend the information youwere looking for?'' Over half (54%) did not respondto the \u00aerst part of this quest ion, but the ave rage length of time spent looking for information by those whodid was thirty minutes.

For question \u00aeve, resp ondents were asked to rank the usefulness of sources they used to \u00aend CAM in-formation (Figure 3). (Note that resp ondents could se- lect more than one source.) Forty-six percent said theyconsidered their colleagues as ``somewhat'' or ``veryuseful'' sources of CAM information and 41% the W eb.Journals were rated ``somewhat'' or ``very useful'' by40%, and almost half of resp ondents wrote in the name of at least one journal they had consulted withinthe past year. Speci\u00aec journal titles rated as being``very useful'' or ``somewhat useful'' are listed in T able 1. One newsletter, Alternative Medicine Alert (2%), was also ment ioned. On e-third (33%) of those who re- sponded to question rated databases ``somewhat'' or ``very useful.'' Through GALEN II (the digital library of UCSF), the library provides faculty, staff, and st udents with free access to several major biomedi cal/health databases, including MEDLINE, BIOSIS Previews t, PsycINFO Abstracts t, ISI Current Contents t(CC), In- ternational Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), and theCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Free accessto other more specialized databases, such as Micro-medex-AltDex t, is provided by individual schools or departments. Figure 4 summarizes data on knowledgeof and use of databases (note that resp ondents could indicate more than one). The majority of resp ondents(87%) rated MEDLINE as useful, with 75% having used it in the past year, while 11% used BIOSIS Pre-views and 9% the NCCAM's free CAM Citation I ndex (renamed in 2001 as CAM on PubMed). Note, h owever, that knowledge and use of the following importantCAM databases was low: the British Library's Alliedand PRoductsALERT (NAPRALERT) database (12%), and Elsevier'sEMBASE (10%). These three resources are not provid-ed free to UCSF researchers but are fee-based andsearched through an intermediary. Other databaseswere cited and cons idered useful by only a small num- ber of resp ondents (1%): these and PsycINFO. Mostsigni\u00aecantly, cons idering its use as a of evi- dence-based medicine (EBM) information for CAM,the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review swas cit- ed by only one individual! Though 41% said the W eb was one resource they found useful for CAM informat ion, only a few indi- viduals were able to name so urces of the information they found there. In their write-in answers, several re-spondents stated that they used search engines such as Google tbut did not know or remember the name of the actual W ebsites where they had found CAM ma-terial.

The others wrote com-ments such as ``not sure,'' ``Please provide access tomore relevant books and journals,'' and ``Please make us more aware of resources already avail able and how to access or use them.'' In answering question 14,``Other comments or suggestions,'' four users made asimilar request for help in accessing and using CAMresources. Seventy-six percent of resp ondents stated they were interested in learning more about CAM resources. Al-most half (45%) expressed a preference for computer-assisted and online instruct ion. Thirteen percent wished for classroom-based instruct ion, and 8% w ant- ed in-person consultations. Other learning methodsand sources suggested by individuals included writtenmaterials distributed by mail or within the library(1%), a W ebsite or electronic mailing list (1%), andsymposia (1%). Figure 5 shows the wide range of medical specialties represented in our survey populat ion. Note that there were no statistically signi\u00aecant correlations betweenspecialty and patterns of CAM information-seekingbehavior. Although the following results were not sta-tistically signi\u00aecant (due to small sa mple size), some interesting trends and observations might merit fur-ther investigation:1. Categories: The single largest group of resp ondents categorized their work as internal medicine (26%); 15%listed their specialty as psychiatry, psyc or addiction medicine; 7% of were in family medicine and another 7% in pe-diatrics.

Internal medicine (31 individuals, 26% of all re-sponde nts): Eighty-\u00aeve percent reported that herbal medicine was applicable to their work, and more than two-thirds said that diet regimens, relaxation exercises,acupuncture, or a combination of these was relevant.Eighty-nine percent were familiar with MEDLINE,and 81% had used it in the past year.3. Psychiatry, psychology, behavioral medicine, or ad- diction medicine (17 individuals, 15% of all respon-dents): The majority of these resp ondents reported that relaxation exercises (82%), guided imagery (65%),and acupuncture (59%) were applic able to their work. Just over half (53%) said that mediation and prayer,herbal medicine, or a combination was relevant. Likethe internal medicine specialists, those behavioral spe-cialists reported that colleagues (59%) and the W eb(41%) were useful sources of CAM informat ion. But about 47% also said that journals and the news media provided useful informat ion. 4.

The other resp ondents said that none were relev ant. DISCUSSIONThe purpose of this study was to investigate the in- formation-seeking behavior of health professionals atUCSF seeking CAM informat ion. Most impor tantly, our results showed that they frequently did not \u00aendthe information they sought. Furthermore, the majorityof our survey resp ondents were unf amiliar with sev- eral important CAM resources. There have been several studies of the information- seeking behavior of physicians, or clinicians, investi-gating the resources they use and the way they \u00aendand use information [16]. Though our study popula-tion of health s ciences fa culty was heterogeneous, en- compassing individuals from all UCSF schools, clinics,and departments, 65% of our resp ondents stated they sought information for use in clinical applications,with around 85% identifying a speci\u00aec medical spe- cialty. Because the majority of our resp ondents sought information to use in clinical practice, we thereforethink it is useful and valid to compare our results forseekers of CAM information with other investigationsthat have speci\u00aecally examined the information-seek-ing behavior of physicians seeking more mainstreammedical or health informat ion. In making such a com- parison, we can make some interesting observationsand see some possible trends among those seekingCAM information. Studies of the use of information resources by phy- sicians' and other related groups of information seek-ers indicate that clinicians choose the informationsource that is most readily avail able, easily a ccessible, and easy to use [17]. At UCSF , MEDLINE is readilyaccessible from computer networks throughout themain campus and its af\u00aeliated sites, and we knowfrom our usage statistics that it has always been themost heavily used database on campus. It was there-fore not unexpected to \u00aend that MEDLINE was theresource most frequently used by the majority of re-spondents seeking CAM information: 87% were aware of the database, and 75% had used it during the pastyear. However, there was a huge gap between the number of resp ondents using MEDLINE (75%) and those using BIOSIS (11%), the next most useful data-base. W e were also surprised to learn that more than85% were not aware of or had not used importantCAM databases such as the British Library's AMEDand NCCAM's CAM on PubMed. Several studies of physician preferences for infor- mation resources have identi\u00aeed textbooks as one of the most important sources of information for patientcare, and they are often a \u00aerst choice for those seekinganswers to clinical questions asmall resp ondents question ``Within the last year, which textbook(s) haveproved most useful for CAM informat ion,'' answer, 5% wrote 91(3) July 2003Table 2 Books used to \u00aend complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) information Title Authors or editors Ranking Rational Phytotherapy: A Physicians' Guide to Herbal Medicine PDR for Herbal Medicines Handbook of Women's Herbs The Honest Herbal Therapeutic Guide to Herbal Medicines Complete Commission E German Monographs The Holistic Pediatrician Stress, Immune Function, and Health: The Connection Primary Care Complementary/AlternativeMedicine: An Evidence-Based Approach times cited by respondents. not use,'' or ``none.'' This result is not surprising, giv- en the current paucity of texts g enerally held to be authoritative sources of CAM informat ion. The absence of an established core group of resources is re\u00afectedin the 2001 Bra ndon/Hill selected list of print books that contains only seven books for the w hole area of CAM [19]. T able 2 lists those texts that were named as useful by resp onde nts. Almost all these titles are in the area of herbal medicine, with two, the PDR for Herbal Medicine and the Commission E Monographs, ac- tually appearing on the Bra ndon/Hill list. Only 41% of our resp ondents useful.'' consulted during the past year ranged fromthe more mainstream biomedical jo urnals such as JA MA and New England Journal of Medicine to more spe- cialized ones such as Phytomedicine and Journal of Trans- personal Psychology. Note, however, that even JAMA, the journal most frequently named, was cited by only 12%of resp onde nts. Although studies of physicians and clinicians seeking more mainstream medical informa-tion have shown that, along with books, journals areoften the primary source used for clinical information[20], the major mainstream medical journals avail able in the United States are still regarded as being poorsources of CAM information [21]. NCCAM and NLMestimate that worldwide 695 journals Fontanarosa the number of CAM citations in MEDLINE wassteadily increasing, many of these citations were sim-ply letters to the editor or editorials, and there werestill few published ra ndomized controlled trials rele- vant clinician [23]. Forty-six percent of our considered their to be ``somewhat'' or ``very useful''sources of CAM informat ion. So for those seeking CAM information, personal communication seems tobe of greater importance than textbooks or journals(Figure 3). Note also that a few of our resp ondents (2%) reported that patients, fr iends and f amily, news media, and newsletters were useful sources of in for- mation. We inberg et al. have noted the importance of physicians seeking advice from colleagues [24], butthis information-seeking behavior might be more im-portant in CAM, where information is dif\u00aecult to \u00aendin print and online resources. Librarians were regard- ed as a useful source of information by only 6% ofresp onde nts. A recent study reported that 90% of physicians ac- cessed the W eb in 2000, with 55% using it on a dailybasis [25]. Casebeer et al., in a study of physician med-ical information-seeking behavior and its relevance tocontinuing education (CE), found that many physi-cians were now using the Internet to seek informationto help in patient care [26]. Forty-one percent of ourresp ondents reported that they used the W eb as a source of CAM informat ion, placing it alo ngside col- leagues and journals as an important resource (Figure3). However, less than 10% were able to name speci\u00aec W ebsites they had accessed, relying instead on the useof general search engines such as Google; seven re-spondents mentioned that they did not even rememberthe name of the sites where they had found CAM ma-terial! Given the wide variation in the quality of in for- mation found on many health-related W ebsites and theplethora of unveri\u00aeed health information posted there,this \u00aending resp ondents exp ressed an interest in learning more about CAM resources, our results show thatthere are considerable oppor tunities for medical li- brarians to educate users in selecting and evaluatingInternet-based CAM informat ion. Although there was interest in a wide variety of CAM therapies and procedures, the area of greatestinterest was herbal medicine (67%). Even if a clinicianremains skeptical of the ef\u00aecacy of herbal remedies, allhealth care prov iders are likely to enco unter patients who use such preparations. Physicians and pharma-cists must therefore become knowledge able about the adverse effects of herbal remedies and the possibilityof deleterious interactions with conventional drugs[28]. The importance of herbal medicine was also re-\u00afected in the resp ondents' choice and knowl edge of resources, where the majority of named textbooks (Ta-ble 2) were recognized important sources of informa-tion about herbs. In addition to several mainstreammedical journals that now regularly carry articles onherbs (such as JA MA and BMJ), several specialized journals named by individuals are also importantsources of herbal information: for exa mple, Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, HerbalGram, and PlantaCAM information-seeking behavior J Med Libr Assoc 91(3) 2003 Similarly, in addition to MEDLINE, the biblio- graphic databases most frequently cited as being rel-evant were ones known to contain unique informationon herbs, such as BIOSIS, NAPRALERT, EMBASE, andAMED. At UCSF , the last three databases are not pro-vided free to the campus community and must besearched for a fee. That they were still cited as ``useful''or ``very useful'' prob ably a ttests to the importance of these resources. When performing mediated onlinesearches for UCSF faculty, we have noted the impor-tance of the NAPRALERT database for hard-to-\u00aend in-formation on Chinese herbal formulations and EM-BASE for unique information on herbal pharmacology. Because CAM therapies and procedures are begin- ning to play a more prominent role in U.S. medicine,academic h ealth s ciences lib rarians must become aware of these new developments and m odify services accordingly. For exa mple, our survey results show that many health professionals si mply do not know where to go to \u00aend reliable CAM information, rel ying too heavily on MEDLINE and W eb-based resources. Datafrom this survey have prompted UCSF librarians topay greater attention to collection dev elopment in CAM, particularly in herbal medicine, highlighting aneed to increase the number of quality print and on-line CAM resources avail able to the campus. Similarly, new W eb pages listing the most reli able CAM We bsites have been added to GALEN II. Data from our survey have been invaluable in help- ing us plan new CAM training programs for bothhealth professionals and af\u00aeliated staff. Because ourresults indicated that UCSF-af\u00aeliated health profes-sionals were interested in learning more about CAMresources, we introduced a class on this topic to thelibrary's informatics program. This class has been wellattended by both faculty and staff. Similarly, the in- creased contact between UCSF faculty and librariansarising from this survey has resulted in invitationsfrom the UCSF School of Nursing and OCIM to giveCAM presentations to both st udents and faculty. In 2002, we also cooperated with faculty from OCIM tocompile lists of appropriate resources for use in theCAM section of the UCSF School of Medicine's cancercurriculum classes. Our survey results indicate that many health pro- fessionals are not familiar with some of the most im-portant sources of CAM informat ion. Hence, in our role as educators, librarians can play an important rolein CAM by teaching health professionals how to \u00aendand use the most reliable p rint and electronic resourc- es.
