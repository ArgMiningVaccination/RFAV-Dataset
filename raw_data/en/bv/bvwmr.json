The body has many natural ways of detoxifying including the liver, kidneys, as well as the lymphatic system (just to name a few). In order to give your immune system a boost this fall, it's time to clear out any build up. Autumn weather causes us to gear up, as well as wind down, as the kids head back to school and the daylight hours dwindle. Routines are in full swing and we can begin to take stock of what will help us cope best through the winter months. Now is a great time to do a full body [cleanse](https://pascoe.ca/products/pascoe-detox-kit). If you're looking at how to reset your digestive system or how to reduce [ inflammation](https://pascoe.ca/products/lymphdiaral-drops) in the body, the answer may be in a full body reset. And lucky for you, the number one immune system booster is also to clear out clutter, removing toxins from the body through detox and boost overall functioning with a healthy diet and active lifestyle. Here are our top tips for detoxing in manageable ways. Reduce Sources of Chronic Inflammation Sometimes we need to get out of our own way! There are several common habits, however, that put extra stress on the body. These include excessive caffeine consumption, overconsumption of refined sugars and carbohydrates, too many inflammatory foods, and living a sedentary lifestyle. Here's how to work to reduce these risk factors and adopt a healthier routine. Caffeine Consuming too much coffee stresses us out and contributes to a vicious cycle. It is a crutch for our energy levels. Decrease your daily consumption and/or start subbing some for decaf. Break the cycle, power through a bit of withdrawal, and come out the otherside with increased [energy](https://pascoe.ca/products/vitapas-b), more restful [ sleep](https://pascoe.ca/products/pascoflair-night), and fewer sugar cravings. Sugar and Simple Carbohydrates If you've ever tried detoxing for weight loss, you've probably cut down on refined sugar and carbohydrates. Sugar is not the enemy, but it can keep you in a similar cycle. These are quick burning energy sources, and as a result, we burn through them really quickly! This leads to a quick crash and has us reaching for more. Pair sugars with healthy fat, like a handful of almonds or some nut butter, or protein, like cottage cheese. Adopt an Anti-Inflammatory Diet An anti-inflammatory diet is low in processed foods and full of whole foods. Sub in heart healthy foods like omega-3s found in cold water fish, chia seeds, flax seeds, and walnuts, for [inflammatory](https://pascoe.ca/products/lymphdiaral-drainage-cream) omega-6 rich processed foods. If you need convenience food, pick items with short ingredient lists with only words you understand. Movement Regular movement is key to keeping the body in working order. Exercise encourages [detoxification](https://pascoe.ca/medical-conditions/detox/) and helps defend the body against bacterial invaders. Find something you enjoy and commit to 10 minutes every day. Exercise is easy to do when we make a routine out of it! Supporting Detoxification Daily detoxification is the path to a healthier and happier life. Stagnancy in the body leads to depression and lack of motivation. Start by increasing your water intake. The body requires a lot of H2O to function optimally and often, we're not getting enough. A simple calculation to remember is to drink half your body weight in ounces everyday. Next up is increasing fibre. This can mean more complex carbohydrates, like whole wheat (minimally processed) bread, beans, or by supplementing your diet with fresh ground flax or chia. Fibre encourages proper elimination, removing toxins from the body through bowel movements. Increasing fibre intake also affects the gut microbiome. Fibre-rich foods feed good bacteria and support healthy [digestion](https://pascoe.ca/products/pascoflair-night). A healthy gut means minimal bloating, burping, or passing gas, and having a [bowel movement ](https://pascoe.ca/products/legapas)1-2 times a day. Avoid Extreme Dieting Extreme detox diets aren't always necessary - unless of course you are suffering severely and need dramatic interventions. The body is designed to detoxify itself. By getting out of its way, limiting stressors, and assisting with its natural processes, we can see dramatic results. The kidneys function by eliminating water-soluble waste products through our urine. Kidney detox, however, requires adequate water consumption to cleanse optimally. To maintain kidney health, they require regular flushing to avoid waste product and toxin build up, which can quickly impair its functioning. Our lymphatic vessels are the key to cleansing the [lymphatic system](https://pascoe.ca/medical-conditions/lymphatic-system/) of waste products and toxins. The lymphatic vessels, nodes, organs and tissues are a system that works closely with our immune system. Lymph circulates through each, filtering out toxins, before eliminating them from the body entirely. Proper lymphatic drainage is a vital part of immune health. Regular exercise encourages this systemic circulation and proper elimination, and helps ensure we maintain strong immunity. To support your immune health further, don't forget about your liver. The liver has a lot of responsibility! The liver produces bile which helps with fat digestion. Liver detox is responsible for filtering all the blood in the body and eliminating waste products and toxins. On top of that, the liver helps balance blood sugar levels, regulate blood clotting, and over 500 vital functions in total! You can support liver detoxification by limiting alcohol consumption, taking stock of the environmental toxins you take in, and decreasing overall toxic load on the liver. You can support its overall functioning by exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet with moderate amounts of fat. Fall Reset This Fall, give your body the room it requires to reset. Reduce your toxic load and systemic stressors, and support its functioning through proper diet and supplementation. Let's help our bodies to get a fresh start before winter kicks in. Let's set our [immune](https://pascoe.ca/products/aronia-pascoe) system up for success! Disclaimer Pascoe Canada does not offer health or medical advice as we are not a healthcare practitioner.
