Goel et al., Science 10.1126/science. abm0829 (2021 RESEARCH ARTICLE S First release: 14 October 2021 science.org (Page numbers not final at time of first release ) 1 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVI D-19) pandemic ha s resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Community -level immunity, acquired through infection or vaccination, is necessary to control the pandemic as the virus continues to circulate ( 1). mRNA vaccines encoding a stabil ized version of t he full -length SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein have been widely administered and clinical trial data demonstrated up to 95% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID -19 ( 2, 3). These mRNA vaccines induce potent humoral immune responses, with neutr alizing antibody titers proposed as the major correlate of protection ( 4-6). Current evidence suggests that circulating antibodies persist for at least 6 months post -vaccination ( 7), though there is some decay from peak levels achieved after the second dos e. This decline f rom peak antibody levels may be associated with an increase in infections over time compared to the initial months post -vaccination ( 8, 9). Yet, vaccine -induced immunity remains highly effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalizatio n, and death even at later timepoints when antibody levels may decline ( 10-12). Previous research has largely focused on responses early in the course of vaccination, with transcriptional analysis identifying potential links between myeloid cell responses and neutralizing antibodies ( 13).

Email : wher ry@pennmedicine.upenn.edu The durability of immune memory after SARS -CoV -2 mRNA vaccination remains unclear. Here, we longitudinally profiled vaccine responses in SARS -CoV -2 na\u00efve and recovered individuals for 6 months after vaccination. A ntibodies decline d from peak levels but remained detectable in most subjects at 6 months. We found mRNA vaccines generated functional memory B cells that increased from 3 -6 months post - vaccination, with the majority of these cells cross -binding the Alpha, Beta, and Delta v ariants. mRNA vaccination further induced antigen- specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and early CD4+ T cell responses correlated with long -term humoral immunity. Recall responses to vaccination in individuals with pre - existing immunity primarily increased anti body levels without substantially altering antibody decay rates. Together, these findings demonstrate robust cellular immune memory to SARS -CoV -2 and variants for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination.

Although antibodies are oft en correlates of vaccine efficacy, memory B cells and memory T cells are important components of the recall response to viral antigens and are a likely mechanism of protection, especially in the setting of exposures in previ- ously vaccinate d individuals whe re antibodies alone do not provide sterilizing immunity ( 23). In such cases, memory B and T cells can be rapidly re -activated, resulting in enhanced control of initial viral replication and limiting viral dissemi- nation in the host ( 24, 25). By responding a nd restricting viral infection within the first hours to days after exposure, cellu-lar immunity can thereby reduce or even prevent symptoms of disease (i.e., preventing hospitalization and death) and po- tentially reduce the ability to sprea d virus to others (26, 27). Immunological studies of SARS -CoV-2 infection show that memory B and T cell responses appear to persist for at least 8 months post -symptom onset ( 28, 29). However, the durabil- ity of these populations of memory B and T cells foll owing vaccination remains poorly understood. The emergence of several SARS -CoV-2 variants, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and B.1.617.2 (Delta), has also raised concerns about increased transmission and potential evasion from vaccine - induced im munity ( 30-33). As such, it is necessary to develop a more complete understanding of the trajectory and dura-bility of immunological memory after mRNA vaccination, as well as how immune responses are affected by current vari- ants of concern (VOCs). Moreover, the United State s and other well -resourced countries have recently announced plans for a third vaccine booster dose, yet information on how pre -existing serological and cellular immunity to SARS - CoV-2 is boosted by mRNA vaccination remains limited. Spe- cifically, it is unc lear how different components of the im- mune response may benefit from boosting and whether boosting has any effect on the durability of these compo- nents. Here, we investigated these key questions by measur- ing SARS -CoV-2-specific antibody, memory B cell, an d memory T cell responses through 6 months post -vaccination in a group of healthy subjects generating primary immune responses to 2 doses of mRNA vaccine compared with a group of SARS -CoV-2 recovered vaccinees generating recall re- sponses f rom pre -existing immunity. These analyses provide insights into mRNA vaccine -induced immunological memory and may be relevant for future vaccine strategies, including recommendations for additional booster vaccine doses. Results and Discussion Cohort Desig n We collected 34 8 longitudinal samples from 61 individuals receiving either the Pfizer BNT162b2 (N=54) or Moderna Fig. 1A), ranging from pre -vaccination baseline to 6 months post - vaccination. This study design allowed u s to monitor the in- duction and maintenance of antigen- specific immune re- sponses to the vaccine. Specifically, sampling at 1 -, 3-, and 6 - months post -vaccination enabled analysis of immune trajec- tories from peak responses after the second va ccine dose throug h establishment and maintenance of immunological memory. This cohort was divided into 2 groups based on prior SARS -CoV-2 infection (N=45 SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve, N=16 SARS -CoV-2 recovered). Age and sex were balanced in both groups. Paired serum a nd peripheral blo od mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected from all individuals, allowing detailed analysis of both serologic and cellular immune memory to SARS -CoV-2 antigens. Notably, the subjects with a prior infection allowed us to study the dy namics of reac- tivating pre -existing immunity with mRNA vaccines. Though pre-existing immunity generated by infection may differ from that generated by vaccination, responses observed in this group may provide insights into boosting of vaccine -induced immun ity using additio nal doses of vaccine. Antibody Responses to SARS -CoV -2 mRNA Vaccines We first measured anti- Spike and anti -RBD binding antibody responses in plasma samples by enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). As reported previously by our group and others, mRNA v accines induced robust circulating anti- body responses to the SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein and Spike RBD with distinct patterns of early response in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve and recovered individuals ( Fig. 1B ) Peak levels of anti-Spike and anti -RBD IgG wer e observed 1 week after the second vaccine dose and subsequently declined over the course of the next 2 months with a half -life of ~28 -33 days (Fig. 1B ), consistent with the dynamics of a typical immune response. This decrease in antibody levels slowed fro m 3-6 months post -vaccination (decay rates were significantly dif- ferent before and after day 89 by likelihood ratio rest; p = 0.004 for anti -Spike IgG, p for anti -RBD IgG) ( Fig. 1B ). Of note, the calculated decay rates for anti -Spike IgG were not si gnificantly different between SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve and re- covered vaccinees. Even after the decrease from peak anti- body responses, all individuals had detectable anti- Spike IgG at 6 months. To examine the functional quality of cir culating antibod- ies, we used a neutralization assay with pseudotyped virus expressing either the wild -type Spike with the prevailing D614G mutation or the B.1.351 variant Spike (sequences in Methods). We focused on B.1.351 neutralization as this Downloaded from https://www.science.org on November 29, 2021 First release: 14 October 2021 science.org (Page numbers not final at time of first release ) 3 variant has consistently shown the highes t immune evasion among the current VOCs. In line with our binding antibody data, neutralizing titers for D614G and B.1.351 declined from peak levels after the second dose to 6 months for both SARS - CoV-2 na\u00efve and recovered tralizing decay kinetics, with slightly longer half -lives than binding antibody responses. Modeled 2 -phase decay rates for D614G neutralization were not significantly different between SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve and re- covered vaccinees wit h a half -life of 72 days between 3 -6 months post -vaccination ( Fig. 1C ). In contrast, relative sta- bilization of neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant was observed between 3 and 6 months post- vaccination in indi- viduals without a prior SARS -CoV-2 infection with a half -life of 231 days, compared to 63 days in SARS -CoV-2 recovered subjects ( Fig. 1C ). titers titers to were significantly lower than D614G. Despite reduced neutralizing ability, 31/33 SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve and 9/9 SARS - recovered individuals still had neut ralizing antibodies against B.1 .351 above the limit of detection at 6 months post- vaccination ( Fig. 1 , C and D). Finally, cross -sectional analysis of 6-month antibody responses also demonstrated that bind- ing antibodies remained highly correlated body responses retain their functional characteristics and neutralizing capacity over time. Memory B Cell Responses to SARS -CoV -2 mRNA Vac- cines In addition to antibodies, we measured the encies of SARS -CoV-2 Spik e- and RBD -specific memory B cells in pe- ripheral blood using a flow cytometric assay. Antigen speci-ficity was determined based on binding to fluorescent SARS - CoV-2 Spike and RBD probes ( Fig. 2 , A and B). Influenza he- magglutinin (HA) from the 2019 flu vacci ne season was also included as a historical antigen control. Full gating strategies are provided in fig. S1A. SARS -CoV-2-specific memory B cells were detectable in all previously uninfected individuals after 2 vaccine doses (the currentl y recommended prima ry vaccination series) and re- mained stable as a percentage of total B cells from 1 -3 months post-vaccination ( Fig. 2C ). All SARS -CoV-2 recovered individ- uals in our study had a robust population of antigen -specific memory B cells at pre -vaccination baseline , and these pre- ex- isting memory B cells were significantly boosted by the first vaccine dose with little change after the second vaccine dose (Fig. 2C ). No changes were observed in influenza HA+ memory B cells after SARS -CoV-2 vaccinatio n for either group (Fig. 2C ). Longitudinal analysis revealed a continued increase in the frequency of Spike+ and Spike+ RBD+ memory B cells from 3-6 months post -vaccination in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve individu- als, whereas the frequency of these antigen -specific me mory B cells in SAR S-CoV-2 recovered subjects continued to decline from peak levels ( Fig. 2C ). One possible explanation for the observed increase in frequency of vaccine -induced memory B cells over time in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve vaccinees is prolonged germinal c enter activity, res ulting in continued export of memory B cells. Indeed, antigen -specific germinal center B cells have been documented in axillary lymph nodes at 15 weeks post -mRNA vaccination in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve subjects (14), though germinal center dynam ics in vaccinees with prior immunity to SARS -CoV-2 remain to be defined. SARS - CoV-2 recovered individuals had consistently higher frequen- cies of antigen -specific memory B cells up to 3 months post - vaccination ( Fig. 2C ). However, due to distinct trajectorie s, both SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve and SARS -CoV-2 recovered individu- als had similar frequencies of Spike+ and Spike+ RBD+ memory B cells at 6 months post -vaccination ( Fig. 2C ), per- haps reflecting some upper limit to the frequencies of anti- gen-specific memory B cells that can be mainta ined long - term. We next investigated the phenotype of mRNA vaccine -in- duced memory B immunoglobulin isotypes in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve vaccinees revealed a steady increase in IgG+ memory B cells over time ( Fig. 2 , D and E, and fig. S2 , A to C), indicating ongoing class -switching. By contrast, IgM+ cells were most abundant at pre -immune baseline and early post-vaccination timepoints. IgM+ and IgA+ memory B cells represented a minor fraction of the overall response in the blood at later timepoints (Fig. 2F and fig. S2C). In SARS -CoV- 2 recovered vaccinees, the majority of Spike+ and Spike+ RBD+ memory B cells were IgG+ at baseline, and the fraction of IgG+ cells continued to increase following vaccination ( Fig. 2, D and E, and fig. S2 , A to C). More over, we asses sed the activation status of antigen- specific memory B cells by CD71 expression ( 37). The percent of Spike+ memory B cells ex- pressing CD71 increased over the course of the primary 2 - dose vaccine regimen in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve individuals, peak- ing at 1 week af ter the second vaccine dose ( Fig. 2G ). The per- cent of CD71+ antigen- specific memory B cells then steadily declined by the 6 -month timepoint, indicating a transition toward a population of mature resting memory B cells. A sim- ilar decrease in C D71 expression was observed from 1 -6 months post -vaccination in SARS -CoV-2 recovered individu- als (Fig. 2G ). Given the robust generation of Spike - and RBD -binding memory B cells, we next tested whether vaccine- induced memory B cells could produce functional antibodies up on re- activation. For other pathogens, this reactivation- induced an- tibody production from memory B cells may be especially Downloaded from https://www.science.org on November 29, 2021 First release: 14 October 2021 science.org (Page numbers not final at time of first release ) 4 relevant in the setting of antigen re -encounter, either through exposure to live virus or an additional vaccine dose ( 38). To this end , we established an in vitro culture system to differ- entiate memory B cells into antibody secreting cells ( 39). PBMC samples from vaccinated individuals at the 6 -month timepoint were cultured with a combination of R848, a TLR7/8 agonist, and IL -2, and cult ure supernatants were col- lected to measure antibody levels and function Fig. 2H ). Anti-Spike IgG was detected in supernatants 4 days post -stimulation ( Fig. 2I ), indicating that memory B cells can act as a rapid source of secondar y antibody pro duc- tion. All 6 -month samples tested generated significant levels of anti -Spike IgG in this assay compared to unstimulated con- 2J in vitro anti -Spike IgG production also correlated with the frequency of fl ow func- tion of memory B cell -derived antibodies from culture an correla ted with the f requency of RBD - specific memory B cells in peripheral blood ( Fig. 2L ). Moreo- ver, pseudovirus neutralization assays demonstrated that an- tibodies produced by memory B cells upon restimulation were capable of neutralizing the B.1.351 and B.1.617 .2 VOCs (Fig. 2M), and RBD -ACE2 binding inhibition (fig. S3 , A to D). The neutralization potential of memory B cell -derived anti- bodies was greater for B.1.617.2 than B.1.351 but was not sig-nificantly different between SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve and recovered neutralizing titers tants correlated with the frequency RBD -specific memory B cells by flow cytometry ( Fig. 2 , N and O), further supporting the functional r elevance of quantifying a ntigen -specific memory B cells in the blood. Taken together, these data demonstrate that mRNA vaccines induced a population of memory B cells that were durable for at least 6 months after vaccination and were capable of rapidly pro ducing functional antibod ies against SARS -CoV-2, including neutralizing anti- bodies against VOCs, upon stimulation. Memory B Cell Responses to Major Variants of Concern (VOCs) We next developed an expanded antigen probe panel to bet-ter quantify memory B cel l specificities to differ ent regions of the Spike protein and test how RBD binding by memory B cells may be affected by the mutations found in emerging VOCs. Specifically, we designed B cell tetramers for 8 SARS - CoV-2 antigens, including full -length Spike, N-terminal B.1.351, and B.1.617.2), and the ( Fig. 3 , A and B). Spike - specific memory B cells were defined based on a multiple - discrimination approach, with binding to full -length Spike plus one or more additional probes . This strategy also al- lowed us to identify memory B cells that cross -bind all variant RBDs (RBD++++). SARS -CoV-2 nucleocapsid was used as a vaccine -irrelevant antigen (but one for which SARS -CoV-2 immune subjects had detecta ble pre -existing immunity; fig. S4, A and B). Full gating strategies are provided in fig. S1B. We also leveraged a separate cohort of healthcare workers (HCW, table S1) who had mild COVID -19 and were sampled longitudinally after a positive serology test to compare vac- cine-induced responses with infection alone ( 40). mRNA vaccination induced robust memory B cell re- sponses to all SARS -CoV-2 Spike antigens in previously unin- fected individuals, and the frequency of these memory B cells increased from 3 -6 months post-vaccination ( Fig. 3C ). In in- dividuals with immunity from prior COVID -19, vaccination resulted in a significant expansion of memory B cells target- ing all Spike antigens. These responses subsequently con- tracted from peak levels, remaining slightly abov e pre - vaccination frequencies at 6 mo nths post -vaccination ( Fig. 3C). In the mild infection HCW cohort, a gradual increase in the frequency of Spike+ NTD+ and Spike+ RBD++++ memory B cells was observed from 2 weeks to 6 months post - seropositive test ( Fig. 3C). Cross -sectional analysis at 6 months post -vaccination or sero -positivity revealed similar antigen- specific memory B cell frequencies between all groups (fig. S4B), suggesting that both vaccination and infec-tion can induce durable memory B cell populat ions. As our panel included probes co vering much of the Spike protein, including NTD, RBD, and S2, we also examined im-munodominance patterns and how B cell immunodominance to Spike changed over time. In previously uninfected individ- uals, ~30% of Spike -binding at pre-vaccine baseline ( Fig. 3D ). Previous work has shown that the S2 domain of SARS- CoV-2 Spike is more conserved with other coronaviruses and it is likely that S2 -binding memory B cells detected at baseline reflect cross -reactivity to these commonly circulati ng coronaviruses ( -specific in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve vaccinees, with S2 -binding B cells ac- counting for 40- 80% of the total Spike -specific memory B cell population at 6 months ( Fig. 3D ). Although the overall fre- quency of NTD+ and RBD+ memory B cells increased over time, they were comparatively less immunodominant than S2 as a percentage of total Spike+ memory B cells ( Fig. 3 , C and D). mRNA vaccination in duced a gradual increase in NTD - specificity over time in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve individuals, whereas RBD -specificity as a percent of Spike+ memory B cells had a more prominent peak 1 week after the second vac-cine dose and then stabilized from 3 -6 months post -vaccina- tion ( Fig. were immunized with mRNA vaccine, a similar immunodomi-nance pattern was observed with S2 -specificity representing Downloaded from https://www.science.org on November 29, 2021 First release: 14 October 2021 science.org (Page numbers not final at time of first release ) 5 most of the total anti -Spike response ( Fig. 3D ). Vaccination transiently increased NTD - and RBD -specificity in this group; howev er, this effect returned to baseline by 6 months post - vaccination. In the context of infection only, we found that NTD, RBD and S2 immunodominance remained relatively stable from early convalescence through late mem ory, with a slight increase in NTD -specif icity over time ( Fig. 3D ). We next examined memory B cell binding to B.1.1.7 (Al- pha), B.1.351 (Beta), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) to WT RBD ( , E and F, and fig. S4 , C and D). All RBD probes wer e used at the same concentration to facilitate di- rect com parisons, and specific point mutations are shown in Fig. 3 , A and B. Variant -binding memory B cells were detect- able in all SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve individuals after 2 vaccine doses and were stable as a perc entage of WT RBD+ cells from 1 -6 months post vaccination ( Fig. 3F). In SARS -CoV-2 recovered individuals, vaccination resulted in a significant increase in memory B cell cross -binding to the B.1.617.2 variant ( Fig. 3F ). ered from a mild infec- tion, there was a gradual increase in cro ss-binding to variants over time ( Fig. 3F ). Class -switching to an IgG dominated re- sponse was also observed in all groups, with vaccination pro-ducing a higher percentage of IgG+ cells compared t o infection alone (fig. S4 , E and F). Of note, the variants and corre sponding mutations tested in our panel had different magnitudes of effect ( Fig. 3 , E and F, and fig. S4 , C and D). B.1.1.7 RBD with a single N501Y mutation had relatively little change in binding compared to WT RBD. Consistent with the in vitro pseudovirus neutralization data above, B.1.351 RBD resulted in a more substantial loss of cross- binding, whereas B.1.617.2 RBD had an intermediate effect on binding. Cross- sectional analysis of variant -binding at the 6 -month timepoint also revealed two major findings. First, all vac-cinated individuals in our study maintained variant -specific memory B cells for at least 6 months, with an average of >50% of WT RBD+ memory B cells also cross -binding all 3 major variants of concern ( Fig. 3 , G and H). Second, mRNA vaccina- tion in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve individuals induced a stronger re- sponse to B.1.351 than infection alone ( Fig. 3H ). One possible explanation for this difference is the immunogen itself. Vac- cinated individuals mount a primary response to the mRNA - encoded prefusion stabilized Spike trimer, potentially allow-ing increased recruitment and/or selection of specific clones that can bind conserved regions of RBD ( 43, 44). In contrast, convalescent individua ls were primed against native, non- stabilized Spike protein. Taken together, our data in dicate ro- bust B cell memory to multiple components of the Spike pro- tein as well as currently described VOCs that continues to evolve and increase in frequency over time. Clonal Evolution of Variant -Specific Memory B Cells We next asked what differences may underly variant -binding versus non -binding properties of memory B cells. Here, we focused on the Beta B.1.351 variant RBD containing the K417N, E484K, and N501Y mutati ons as this variant resulted in the greatest loss of binding relative to WT RBD ( Fig. 3 , E, G, and H). We designed a sorting panel to identify 3 popula- tions of memory B cells with different antigen -binding speci- ficities: 1) memory B cells that bind full -length Spike but not RBD, 2) memory B cells that bind full- length Spike and WT RBD but not B.1.35 1 variant RBD, and 3) memory B cells that bind full -length Spike and cross- bind both WT Fig. 4A and fig. S5A). Na\u00efve B cells were also sorted as a control. These populations were isolated from 8 SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve and 4 SARS -CoV-2 recov 4A and fig. S5A). Con- sistent with our previous data, between 50 -80% a majority of RBD epitopes in the response are shared by the WT and mutant RBDs. To gain insight into the clonal composition of the differ- ent spike and/or RBD -binding B cell populations, IgH rear- rangements were amplifie d from the sorted populations (N=48 total) and related sequences were grouped into clones (N=348,346 clones, table S2). We analyzed the contribution of the top copy number clones to the overall repertoire as measured by the D20 index. The D20 index ranged from less than 1% for na\u00efve B cells (which is expected for a diverse, non - clonally expanded populatio n) to greater than 20% for some of the antigen- binding populations ( Fig. 4C ). B.1.351 trended toward higher D20 sco res, suggesting greater clonal expansion and/or lower diversity compared to the other antigen- binding populations (Fig. 4C ). The clonality of antigen -binding memory B cell pop- ulations was not significantly different after vaccination based on prior immunit y, although there was heterogeneity in clonal expansion across individuals. We further analyzed IGHV gene usage across the different antigen- binding memory B cell populations. Hierarchical clustering revealed that VH gene profiles were overall similar in vaccinated individuals regardless of prior SARS -CoV-2 in- fection status ( Fig. 4D and fig. S5B), indicating that both vac- cination and infection followed by vaccination can recruit similar clones into the response. Rather, IGHV gene usage largely clustered bas ed on the antigen specificity, with in- creased usage of VH3 -53 and Fig. 4D and fig. S5B). Of note, both of these IGHV genes are known to be enriched in spike -binding B cells ( 45, 46). These differences in IGHV gene usage between WT only and variant cross- binding phenotype suggested that these cells may derive, at least partial ly, from different B cell clones that were independently recruited into the vaccine response. Analysis of VH gene sequences also revealed clear diffe r- ences in somatic hypermutation (SHM) between the different Downloaded from https://www.science.org on November 29, 2021 First release: 14 October 2021 science.org (Page numbers not final at time of first release ) 6 antigen- binding populations. As expected, SARS -CoV-2- specific memory B cell clones had significantly more VH nu- cleotide mutations compared to na\u00efve B cell clones ( Fig. 4 , E and F, and fig. S5C). S pike+, RBD non -binding memory B cells (which include NTD - and S2 -binding populations) had high SHM ( Fig. 4 , E and F, and fig. S 5C), consistent with ger- minal center -dependent responses as well as possible recall responses of pre -existing S2 cross- reactive c lones. Notably, significantly higher levels of SHM were observed in variant RBD cross -binding clones compared to WT RBD only cl ones (Fig. 4 , E and F, and fig. S5C). Additionally, boosting of infec- tion-acquired immunity by mRNA vaccination in SARS -CoV- 2 rec overed donors did not produce higher SHM in RBD - binding memory B cell clones compared to vaccination alone (Fig. 4F ). To determine if var iant cross- binding clones could evolve from WT RBD -binding clones, we next investigated if there was any clonal overlap between these populations. For clonal overlap analysis, we focused on larger clones (defined as hav- ing copy numbers at or above 50% of t he mean copy number frequency within each sequencing library) ( 47), as larger clones are more readily sampled at both t he clonal and sub - clonal levels. Among such larger clones, 2.5% had sequence variants that were isolated from both WT RBD and cross-bindi ng populations ( Fig. 4G and S5D). Lineage that WT and cross -binding sequence variants local- ized on separate branches (representative lineages shown in Fig. 4H ), indicating that the shift in antigen- reactivity was not due to contaminatio n of the sorted populations (in which case sequence variants localize to the same nodes). Next, to determine if cros s-binding activity arose from WT binding or vice versa, we used SHM as a molecular clock and counted the fraction of overlapping clonal line ages in which variant binding had higher, lower, or equivalent levels of SHM to WT RBD-binding variants. Consistent with the overall SHM data, this analysis of overlapping clones revealed higher levels of SHM in the variant binding sequences compared to WT only binding sequences ( Fig. 4 , I and J), suggesting a clonal evolu- tion from WT only binding to variant RBD co -binding for at least some clones. Taken together, these data indicate that mRNA vaccine - induced memory B cells that bind variant RBDs have higher SHM compared to clones that only bind WT RBD. Moreover, the clonal relationships between WT -only and cross -binding RBD-specific memory B cells suggest that variant binding ca- pacity can evolve from clones that initially bound to WT RBD. Ongoing evolution and se lection of these clones could there- fore facilitate cross- protection against different VOCs. These findings are consistent with earlier work suggesting that SHM and affinity maturation are important for the acquisi- tion of broader neutralization activity of RBD -binding anti- bodies that are formed in response to SARS -CoV-2 infection (48, 49). It is presently unclear h ow additional antigen expo- sure through booster vaccination, environmental virus expo-sure, or overt infection may impact additional affinity matura tion toward improved variant -binding. Memory CD4+ and CD8+ T Cell Responses to SARS -CoV - 2 mRNA Vaccines In add ition to antibodies and memory B cells, memory T cells can contribute to protection upon re -exposure to virus. Memory T cell responses have also b een shown to be less af- fected by variants of concern than humoral immune re- sponses ( 21, 50). To determine whet her mRNA vaccination induced durable antigen -specific memory T cell responses, we performed a flow cytometric analysis using an activation induced marker (AIM) assay. PBMCs were stimulated with peptide megapools containing optimized Spike epitopes ( 51, 52). Antigen- specific responses were quantified as the fre- quency of AIM+ non -na\u00efve T cells in stimulated samples with background subtraction from pai red unstimulated controls (Fig. 5 , A and B) (19). Full gating strategies are provided in fig. S6. Antigen -specific CD4+ T cells were defined based on co-expression of CD40L and CD200. Antigen -specific CD8+ T cells were defined based on expression of 4 of 5 total activa- tion markers as described previously ( 19). Consistent with recent studies, SARS -CoV-2 mRNA vac- cination efficiently primed antigen- specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells ( Fig. 5 , C and D) (20-22). All individuals in our cohort, regardless of prior inf ection with SARS -CoV-2, had detectable CD4+ T cell responses above their individual base- line one week f ollowing the second vaccine dose ( Fig. 5C ). Most (36/41) SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve individuals also generated detectable CD8+ T cell responses after the second do se (Fig. 5D). In contrast, vaccination did little to further boost pre - vaccination antigen- specific CD8 + T cell frequencies in SARS - CoV-2 recovered individuals ( Fig. 5D ). A marked contraction phase was observed from peak responses to 3 -months post - vaccinat ion, with a half -life of 47 days for CD4+ T cells and 27 days for CD8+ T cells ( Fig. 5 , C and D). These kinetics are consistent with a typical T cell response after the effector phase ( 53). After this initial contraction, antigen- specific memory CD4+ T cell freq uencies stabilized from 3 -6 months post-vaccination with a half -life of 187 days, whereas CD8+ T cells continued to decline. Overall, 28/31 SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve individuals had vaccine -induced antigen -specific CD4+ T cell responses at 6 months post -vaccination above pre -vaccina- tion baseline levels, and 13/31 had detectable CD8+ T cell re- sponses above base line ( Fig. 5 , C and D). In SARS -CoV-2 recovered subjects, mRNA vaccination had only a modest im-pact on T cell responses and did not elevate the magnitude of long-term antigen -specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cell memory above baseline levels ( Fig. 5 , C and D). Take n together, these data indicate that mRNA vaccination generates durable Downloaded from https://www.science.org on November 29, 2021 First release: 14 October 2021 science.org (Page numbers not final at time of first release ) 7 SARS -CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell memory in individuals who were not previously infected with SARS -CoV-2 and only tran- siently boosts these responses in SARS -CoV-2 recovered indi- viduals. Antigen- specific T cells can further be classified into dif- ferent memory subsets using cell surface markers ( Fig. 5E ). Peak CD4+ T cell responses following SARS -CoV-2 mRNA vaccination were composed of predominantly central memory (CM; - CD27+ -) cells in both SARS na- \u00efve and recovered individuals ( Fig. 5F ) During contrac- tion from peak responses, antigen -specific CCR7+ CM cells were largely lost from circulation, whereas antigen -specific CCR7- EM1 cells stabilized in frequency from 3 -6 months post-vaccination. Moreover, the percentage of the peak CD4+ response that was EM1 cells, but not other memory subset s, was significantly associated with the durability of the overall CD4+ T cell respon se at 3 and 6 months post -vaccination ( Fig. 5, G and H), suggesting that EM1s are long -lived memory CD4+ T cells and that early skewing toward an EM1 pheno-type contributes to du rable CD4+ T cell memory. Although our AIM assay allows detection of low -freque ncy memory CD8+ T cell responses for overall quantification, reliable sub- setting of antigen- specific CD8+ T cells at memory timepoints was not feasible due to the low number of events. mRNA vaccination also preferentially induced antigen- specific CD4+ cTfh and Th1 helper cells in both SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve and recovered individuals, whereas Th2, Th17, and Th1/17 cells were detected at lower levels in the AIM assay (Fig. 5I ). Although the overall frequency of antigen -specific CD4+ T cells stabilized from 3 -6 mont hs post -vaccination, cTfh and Th1 cells had distinct trajectories. Specifically, cTfh cells declined more rapidly than Th1 cells both during the in- itial contraction phase and fr om 3 -6 months post -vaccination (Fig. 5J ), perhaps reflecting redistribution phoid contrast, Spike -specific Th1 cells did not de- cline in the blood from 3 -6 months post -vaccination. While cTfh cells may be important in the early st ages of vaccine re- sponse, these data indicate that the durable component of the memory CD4+ T cell response at 6 months post -vaccine is largely composed of Th1 cells, and boosting of pre -existing immunity with mRNA vaccine does not change the magni- tude or subset composition of the CD4+ memory T cell re- sponse. Integrated Analysis of I mmune Components and Vac- cine -Induced Memory to SARS -CoV -2 A goal of this study was to assess the development of multiple components of antigen -specific immune memory over time in the same individuals following SARS -CoV-2 mRNA vac- cination. This dataset allo wed us to integrate longitudinal an- tibody, memory B cell, and memory T cell responses to construct an immunological landscape of SARS -CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. To this end, we app lied uniform manifold ap- proximation and projection (UMAP) to visualize the traj ec- tory of vaccine -induced adaptive immunity over time. This analysis revealed a continued evolution of the overall im-mune response in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve subjects after mRNA space ( Fig. 6A ). Projection of individual immune components onto the UMAP space revealed that pri-mary vaccination was largely defined by rapid induction of CD4+ T cell immunity ( Fig. 6B ). The second vaccine dose in- duced peak antibody, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell responses. Antibodies and CD4+ T cells then remained durable through later memory timepoints, coinciding with a trajectory shift toward peak memory B cell responses. Notably, al l 6-month samples clustered away from pre -immune baseline samples (Fig. 6A ), highlighting the durable multi -component immune memory induced by mRNA vaccination. At 6 months, we ob-served some heterogeneity in the immune landscape. This heterogeneity may be partially driven by a significant nega- tive correlation between age and anti -Spike IgG (fig. S7 , A and B). Sex did not appear to have any association with the overall antigen- specific response to mRNA vaccination (fig. S7C). SARS -CoV-2 recovered individuals occup ied a wide range of UMAP space at baseline, highlighting the variability of infec-tion-induced virus -specific immunity ( Fig. 6A ). Time since in- fection did not appear to fully explain the observed variability for SARS -CoV-2 recovered individuals at pre -vacci ne baseline (fig. S7D). Vaccination uniformly shifted SARS -CoV-2 recov- ered individuals at 3 months post -vaccine to a region defined by high levels of all antigen -specific immune parameters an- alyzed ( Fig. 6A ). This region was largely unoccupied by SARS - CoV-2 na\u00efve vaccinees, underscoring the unique potency of reactivating pre -existing immune responses. These uniquely high responses were transient, however, as SARS -CoV-2 re- covered individuals at 6 months post -vaccine shifted toward the UMAP space occupied by memory timepoints in SARS - CoV-2 na\u00efve individuals at 3 and 6 months post -vaccine. A second question is how different antigen -specific mRNA vaccine -induced immune components interact with each other over time. Antibody responses after the first or second vaccine dose did not correlate with the magnitude of B cell memory at 6 mon ths (Fig. 6C ). However, at 3 - and 6 -months post-vaccination antibodies were significantly associated with contemporaneous memory B cell responses, an effect most prominent for B.1.351 neutralizing titers ( Fig. 6C ). Given Tfh cells in generating efficient humoral immun- ity, we next investigated the relationship between antigen- specific T cells and humoral responses. CD4+ T cell re-sponses, especially cTfh responses, as early a s 2 weeks after the first dose of mRNA vaccine were positively correlated with antibody responses up to and including 6 months post - Downloaded from https://www.science.org on November 29, 2021 First release: 14 October 2021 science.org (Page numbers not final at time of first release ) 8 vaccination ( Fig. 6D and fig. S7E). This observation suggested that rapid mobilization of CD4+ T cell responses by the first mRNA vaccine dose had a lasting effect on humoral immun- ity. Like memory B cells, the magnitude of CD4+ T cell re-sponses at 6 months was also correlated with antibodies at 6 months ( Fig. 6D ), suggesting that antibody levels may pro- vide a useful (though incomp lete) proxy for the magnitude of memory B and CD4+ T cell responses at 6 months post -vac- cination. Taken together, these data identify key temporal re-lationships between different branches of the human immune response that are associated with long -term immu ne memory after mRNA vaccination. Next, we investigated if the magnitu de of peak responses after the second vaccine dose in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve subjects was predictive of memory responses at 3 and 6 months. In- deed, peak antibody levels were significantly corr elated with later antibody levels (fig. S7F). Memory B cell frequencie s 1 week after the second dose were also correlated significantly with 3 - and 6 -month frequencies (fig. S7F). Like antibodies and memory B cells, peak T cell responses after the second dose were predictive of later timepoints (fig. S7F). Overall, these dat a suggest that the magnitude and trajectory of indi- vidual components of the immune response are patterned soon after the second vaccine dose in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve indi- viduals. This dataset also presented an opportunity to investigate the impact of mRNA vacci nation in subjects with pre -existing immunity, in this case from a prior SARS -CoV-2 infection. To investigate the dynamics of these recall responses, we exam-ined the change in individual SARS -CoV-2-specific immune responses from pre -vaccine baseline levels . Vaccination mod- estly increased pre -existing memory B cell and CD4+ T cell frequencies at 1 month, with a more robust increase in anti- body levels ( Fig. 6E ). To investigate the contribution of pre - existing immune memory to these recall antibody responses, we correlated the magnitude of pre- vaccine memory re- sponses with the change in antibody levels after vaccination. The frequency of SARS -CoV-2-specific memory B cells was the only feature of pre -existing immunity that correlated signifi- cantly with antibody responses after vaccination ( Fig. 6F ), consistent with a major role for memory B cells in recall re- sponses. As we observed that memory B cell frequencies con- tinue to increase in the months post -vaccination, we investigated whether time since infection impa cted the mag- nitude of the antibody recall response. Indeed, a longer inter-val between infection and vaccination correlated with a significantly greater neutralizing antibody recall respo nse to D614G, with similar trends for B.1.351 neutralization and for binding antibodies to Spike and RBD ( Fig. 6F ). Thus, these data suggest that there may be some benefit to a longer in-terval between initial priming and subsequent restimulation or boost of immune responses to SARS -CoV-2. Finally, we evaluated the decay kine tics of SARS -CoV-2- specific recall responses. Boosting of Spike - and RBD -specific memory B cell and memory CD4+ T cell responses was tran-sient and returned to pre -vaccination baseline by 3-6 months (Fig. 6E ). CD8+ T cell responses were not boosted in SARS - CoV-2 immune subjects and decayed from peak at a compa- anti -Spike and anti -RBD binding antibodies was also transient an d returned to near baseline by 6 months post-vaccine ( Fig. 6E ). Only D 614G and B.1.351 remained substantially above pre -vaccine baseline levels (~10 -fold increase at 6 months), but these antibody lev- els were also declining over time. Notably, the decay rate of antibodies was similar between SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve and SARS - CoV-2 recovered vaccinees ( Fig. 6E ). Lastly, we estimated benefit of mRNA vaccine -mediated \"boosting\" of pre -existing immunity in this setting by calculating, based on antibody half-lives, the time it would take for recall responses to re turn to pre -vaccine antibody levels. We estimated from these cal- culations that recall responses to mRNA vaccination will maintain antibodies above pre -vaccination levels in this co- hort o f mostly young individuals who recovered from mild COVID -19 for approx imately 7 -16 months. In addition, recall responses in this cohort remained above peak responses in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve vaccinees, where clinical efficacy is well - established, for 2 -3 months for Spike -binding antibodies and 6-10 months for neutralizing titers (table S3). Overall, these data suggest that boosting of infection- induced immunity with mRNA vaccination does not dramatically enhance al-ready durable memory B cell or memory T cell res ponses. Ra- ther, the benefit of vaccination in the context of pre -existing immunity may be limited to a significant but transient in- crease in antibody, with some of this benefit to antibody lev-els remaining at 6 months. Concluding Remarks These studies prov ide insight into the evolution of immuno- logical memory following SARS -CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Specifically, the continued increase in SARS -CoV-2-specific memory B cells between 3 and 6 months post -mRNA vaccina- tion, even as antibody levels declined in the s ame individuals, suggests that prolonged germinal center reactions ( 14) con- tinue to generate circulating memory B cells for at least sev-eral months following vaccination. A majority of these memory B cells were able to cross -bind VOCs, including B.1.1.7 (A lpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and B.1.617.2 (Delta), and clonal relationships indicated that at least some of these cross -bind- ing memory B cells evolved via somatic hypermutation from clones that initially lacked variant binding. This evolution of variant binding may have implications for booster strategies aimed at targeting antib ody responses to future variants. As demonstrated here, these memory B cells are capable of Downloaded from https://www.science.org on November 29, 2021 First release: 14 October 2021 science.org (Page numbers not final at time of first release ) 9 mounting rapid recall responses, providing a new source of antibodies upon infection or booste r vaccination. Further- more, there may be differences in immunity gener ated by mRNA vaccination versus infection, as memory B cells 6 months post -vaccination were qualitatively superior at bind- ing VOCs compared to memory B cells 6 months after recov- ering fr om mild COVID -19. Variant binding developed rapidly following two -dose mRNA vaccination but evolved more slowly following infection, consistent with conclusions drawn from other approaches ( 17). In addition to durable B cell memory, SARS -CoV-2-specific mem ory CD4+ T cells were relatively stable from 3 -6 months post mRNA vacc ination, and the vast majority of vaccinees maintained robust CD4+ T cell responses at 6 months. Early CD4+ T cell responses cor- related with 3- and 6 -month humoral responses, highlightin g a role for T cell immunity in shaping the overall response to vaccin ation. Together, these data identify durable cellular im- munity for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination with persistence of high -quality memory B cells and strong CD4+ T cell memory in most individuals. These data may also provide context for understan ding potential discrepancies in vaccine efficacy at preventing in- fection versus severe disease, hospitalization, and death ( 10, 11). Declining antibody titers over time likely reduce the po- tential that vaccination will completely prevent infection or provi de near -sterilizing immunity. However, the durability of cellular immunity, here demonstrated for at least 6 months, may contribute to rapid recall responses that can limit initial viral replication and dissemination in the host, thereby pre- venting severe disease. Finally, by examining individuals with pre-existing immunity following infection, we were able to gain insights into the possible effects of booster vaccination. In this setting , boosting of pre -existing immunity from prior infection with mRNA vac cination mainly resulted in a tran- sient benefit to antibody titers with little -to-no long -term in- crease in cellular immune memory. Antibody decay rates were similar in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve a nd recovered vaccinees, suggesting that additional vaccine doses will temporarily pro- long antibody- mediated protection without fundamentally altering the underlying landscape of SARS -CoV-2 immune memory. It will be important to examine whether similar dy- namics exist following other types of immune boosting in- cluding a third dose of mRNA vaccine in previously vaccinated individuals or SARS -CoV-2 infections that occur after vaccination. Nevertheless, these data provide evidence for durable immune memory at 6 months after mRNA vac- cination and are relevant for interpreting epidem iological data on rates of infections in vaccinated populations and the implementation of booster vaccine strategies. Despite the overall strengths of this study, including the large sam ple size and integrated measurement of multiple components of the anti gen-specific adaptive immune response, there are several limitations. First, the overall num- ber of subjects, while substantial for studies with high depth of immune profiling, was still limited compared to epidemi- ological or phase 3 clinical trials. In par ticular, only 9 -10 in- dividuals with pre -existing immunity from SARS -CoV-2 infection were fully sampled through 6 months post -vaccina- tion. Second, it is possible that the timepoints in th is study do not perfectly capture the full kinetics of the response fo r each individual immune component. For example, it is possi-ble that antibody levels could stabilize at timepoints beyond 6 months rather than continuing to decay at the observed rates. Additionally, the comparison of variant -specific im- mune memory induced by vaccination versus infection is lim- ited to mild COVID -19 cases and does not include more severe disease. Timepoints for sampling of infection only, although broadly consistent with the vaccination studies, were also not perfectly aligned with the date of actual infection as samples were longitudinally collected following a positive serology test rather than an acutely positive PCR test in most cases. Regarding CD8+ T cell responses, o ur AIM assay was effective at capturing peak responses after vaccinati on; however, this assay may not be sensitive enough to detect very low fre-quency CD8+ T cells at memory timepoints. Other ap-proaches, such as MHC tetramers, will be necessary in the future to further interrogate memory CD8+ T cell responses after vaccinati on. Finally, our cohort is skewed toward young healthy individuals. As such, the results described may not fully represent the durability of vaccine -induced immunity in older individuals or populations with chronic diseases and/or compromised immune system s, and future studies will be re- quired to better quantify the immune response over time in these populations. Methods Clinical Recruitment and Sample Collection 61 individuals (45 SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve, 16 SARS -CoV-2 recov- ered) were consented and enrolled in th e longitudinal vac- cine study with approval from the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board (IRB# 844642). All participants were otherwise healthy and based on self -reporte d health screening did not have any history of chronic health condi- tions. Subjects were stratified based on self -reported and la- boratory evidence of a prior SARS -CoV-2 infection. All subjects received either Pfizer (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA -1273) mRNA va ccines. Samples at 6 timepoints: baseline, ~2 weeks post -primary immunization, day of secondary ~1 week post -secondary im- munization, ~3 months post- -primary immunization. 80 -100mL of peri pheral blood samples and clinical questionnaire data were collected at each study visit. A separate cohort of 26 SARS -CoV-2 con- valescent individuals was used to compare vaccine -induced Downloaded from https://www.science.org on November 29, 2021 First release: 14 October 2021 science.org (Page numbers not final at time of first release ) 10 immune responses to immune responses upon natural SARS - CoV-2 infection. This cohort was a subset from a sero -moni- toring study previously desc ribed ( 40) that was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board (IRB# 842847). Recent or active SARS -CoV-2 infections were identified based on SARS -CoV-2 RBD antibody levels and/or SARS -COV-2 PCR testing. Longitudinal samples were col- lected from seropositive participants up to ~200 days post se- roconversion to study long -term immune responses. Full cohort and demographic information is provided in table S1. Additional healthy donor samples were collected with ap-proval from the Unive rsity of Pennsylvania Institutional Re- view Board (IRB# 845061) Peripheral Blood Sample Processing Venous blood was collected into sodium heparin and EDTA tubes by standard phlebotomy. Blood tubes were centrifuged at 3000rpm for 15 min to separate plasma. H eparin and EDTA plasma were stored at - 80\u00b0C for downstream antibody analysis. Remaining whole blood was diluted 1:1 with R1 (RPMI + 1% Penicil- and layered onto SEPMATE tubes (STEMCELL Technologies) containing lymphoprep gradient (STEMCELL Technologies). SEPMATE tubes were centri-fuged at 1200 g for 10 min and the PBMC fraction was col- lected into new tubes. PBMCs were the n washed with R1 and treated with ACK lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher) for 5 min. Sam- ples were wa shed again with R1, filtered with a 70 m filter, and counted using a Countess automated cell counter (Thermo Fisher). Aliquots containing 5 -10x10 6 PBMCs were cryop reserved RBD -Specific Anti- bodie s Plasma samples Plasmids encoding the recombinant full- length Spike protein and the RBD were provided by F. Krammer (Mt. Sinai) and purified b y nickel -nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). ELISA plates (Immulon 4 HBX, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with PBS or 2 ug/mL recombi- nant protein and store d overnight at 4C. The next day, plates were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween- 20 (PBS -T) and blocked for 1 hour with PBS -T supplemented with 3% non-fat milk powder. Samples were heat -inactivated for 1 hour at 56C and diluted in PBS -T supplemented with 1% non - fat milk powder. After washing the plates with PBS -T, 50 uL diluted sample was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 2 hours and washed with PBS -T. Next, 50 uL of 1:5000 diluted goat -HRP anti -human IgM-HRP (SouthernBiotech) was added to each well and plates were incubated for 1 hour. Plates were washed with PBS-T before 50 uL SureBlue 3,3 ,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (KPL) was added to each well. After 5 min incuba- tion, 25 uL of 250 mM hydrochloric acid was added to each well to stop the reaction. Pl ates were read with the Spectra- Max 190 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at an optical density (OD) of 450 nm. Monoclonal antibody CR3022 was included on each plate to convert OD values into relative an- tibody concentrations. Plasmids to express CR3022 were pro- vided by I. Wilson (Scripps). Detection of SARS -CoV -2 Neutralizing Antibodies 293T cells were seeded for 24 hours at 5 X 10 6 cells per 10 cm dish and were transfected using calcium phosphate with 35 g of pCG1 SARS S encoding a codon SARS -CoV-2 S gene with an 18 -residue truncation in the cytoplasmic tail (kindly provided by Stefan Pohlmann). Mutations in pseudo- virus constructs cells were fed with fresh media containing 1mM sodium bu- tyrate to increase expression of the transfected DNA. 24 hours after transfection, the SARS -CoV-2 Spike expressing cells were infected for 2 hours with VSV-G pseudotyped VSVG-RFP at an MOI of ~1. Virus containing media was re- moved and the cells were re- fed with media without serum. Media containing the VSV G-RFP SARS -CoV-2 pseudotypes was harvested 28 -30 hours after infection, clarified by centrif- ugatio n twice at 6000 g, then aliquoted and stored at - 80\u00b0C until used for antibody neutralization analysis. All sera were heat-inactivated for 30 min at 55\u00b0C prior to use in the neu- tralization assay. Vero E6 cells stably expressing TMPRSS2 were seeded in 100 l at 2.5x10 4 cells/well in a 96 well colla- gen coated plate. The next day, 2 -fold serially diluted serum samples were mixed with VSV G-RFP -CoV-2 pseudo- type virus (100 -300 focus forming units/well) and incubated for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. 1E9F9, a mouse anti -VSV Indiana G, was also included in this mixture at a concentration of 600 ng/ml (Absolute Antibody, Ab01402 -2.0) to neutralize any potential VSV-G carryover virus. The serum -virus mixture was then used to replace the media on VeroE6 TMPRSS2 cells. 22 hours post-infection, the cells were washed and fixed with 4% par- aformaldehyde before visualization on an S6 FluoroSpot An- alyzer (CTL, Shaker Heights OH). Individual infected foci were enumerated and the values were compared to control wells without antibody. Th e focus reduction neutralization ti- ter 50% (FRNT 50) was measured as the greatest serum dilu- tion at which focus count was reduced by at least 50% relative to control cells that were infected with pseudotype virus in Downloaded from https://www.science.org on November 29, 2021 First release: 14 October 2021 science.org (Page numbers not final at time of first release ) 11 the absence of human serum. FRNT 50 titers for each sample were measured in at least two technical replicates and were reported for each sample as the geometric mean of the tech- nical replicates. Detection and Phenotyping of SARS -CoV -2-Specific Memory B Cells Antigen- specific B cells were detected using biotinylated pro- teins in combination with different streptavidin (SA) - fluorophore conjugates as described ( 16). All reagents are listed in table S4. Biotinylated proteins were multimerized with fluorescently labeled SA for 1 hour at 4C. Full -length Spike protein was mixed with SA -BV421 mass ratio Spike RBD was mixed with SA -APC at a 2:1 mass ratio (25ng RBD with 12.5ng SA; ~4:1 molar ratio). Biotinylated influenza HA pools were mixed with SA -PE at a 6.25:1 mass ratio (100ng HA pool with SA; ~6:1 molar ratio). Influenza 2019 trivalent vaccine (A/Bris- bane/02/2018/H1N1, B/Colorado/06/2017) were chosen as a historical antigen and were biotinylated using an EZ -Link Mi- cro NHS -PEG4 Biotinylation Kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Excess biotin was subse-quently removed from HA antigens using Zebra Spin Desalt- ing Columns 7K MWCO (Thermo Fisher) and protein was quantified with a Pierce BC A Assay (Thermo Fisher). SA - BV711 was used as a decoy probe without biotinylated protein to gate out cells that non- specifically bind streptavidin. All experimental steps were performed in a 50/50 mixture of PBS + 2% FBS and Brilliant Buffer (BD Bioscience ). Antigen probes for Spike, RBD, and HA were prepared individually and mixed together after multimerization with 5uM free D - biotin (Avidity LLC) to minimize potential cross -reactivity be- For staining, 5x10 6 cryopreserved PBMC sam- ples were pre pared in a 96 -well U -bottom plate. Cells were first stained with Fc block (Biolegend, 1:200) and Ghost 510 Viability Dye for 15 min at 4C. Cells were then washed and stained with 50uL antigen probe master mix containing 1 hour at 4C. Following incubation with antigen probe, cells were washed again and stained with anti - CD3, anti -CD19, anti -CD20, anti -IgM, -IgG, and anti -IgA for 30 min at 4C. After surface stain, cells were washed and fixed in 1% PFA overnight at 4C. Antigen- specific gates for B cell probe assays were set based on healthy donors stained without antigen probes (similar to an FMO control) and were kept the same for all experi mental runs. Detection of Variant RBD, NTD, and S2 -Specific Memory B Cells Variant RBD, NTD, and S2 -specific memory B cells were detected using a similar approach as described above. SARS - CoV-2 nucleocapsid was used as a vaccine -irrelevant antigen control. All reagents are listed in table S4. Probes were mul- timerized for 1.5 hours at the following ratios (all ~4:1 molar ratios calculated relative to the streptavidin- only component irrespective of fluorophore): 200ng full -length Spike was mixed with 20ng -BV421, 30ng -terminal domain with 14ng 12.5ng SA -BUV615 was used as a decoy probe. All antigen probes were multimerized sep- arately and mixed together with 5uM free D -biotin. Prior to staining, total B cell s were enriched from 20x10 6 cryo- preserved PBMC samples by negative selection using an EasySep human B cell isolation kit (STEMCELL, #17954). B cells were then prepared in a 96 -well U -bottom plate and stained with Fc block and Ghost 510 Viability Dye as de- scribed above. Cells were washed and stained with 50uL an- tigen probe master mix for 1 hour at 4C. After probe staining, cells were washed again and stained with anti -CD3, anti - CD19, anti -CD27, anti -CD38, anti -IgD, and anti -IgG for 30 min at 4C. After surfac e stain, cells were washed and fixed in 1X Stabilizing Fixative (BD Biosciences) overnight at 4C. For sorting, pre -enriched B cells were stained with Fc block and Ghost 510 Viability Dye, followed by full -length Spike, WT RBD, and B.1.351 RBD probes as des cribed above. Cells were then stained for surface markers with anti -CD19, anti-CD20, anti -CD27, and anti -CD38, and anti -IgD. After sur- face stain, cells were washed and resuspended in PBS + 2% FBS for acquisition. In Vitro Differentiation of Memory B Cells to Antibody Secreting Cells Memory B cells from bulk PBMC samples were differentiated into antibody secreting cells as described ( 39). Briefly, 1x10 6 cryopreserved PBMCs were seeded lates. PBMCs were then stimulated with 1000U/mL recombinant human IL -2 and 2.5ug/mL R848 for 10 days. Supernatants were collected at the indicated timepoints. anti -Spike IgG was quantified using a Human SARS -CoV-2 Spike (Trimer) IgG ELISA Kit instructions. RBD -ACE2 binding inhibition was measured us- ing a SARS -CoV-2 Neutralizing Ab ELISA Kit (Invitrogen). For anti -Spike IgG culture supernatants at a 1:2 dilution. Pseudovirus neutralization titers were also measured in culture supernatants starting at a 1:2 Downloaded from https://www.science.org on November 29, 2021 First release: 14 October 2021 science.org (Page numbers not final at time of first release ) 12 dilution as described above. Detection of SARS -CoV -2-Specific T Cells SARS -CoV-2-specific T cells were detected using an activation induced marker assay. All reagents are listed in table S5. PBMCs were thawed by warming frozen cryovials in a 37\u00b0C water bath and resuspending Streptomycin (R10). Cells were washed once in R10, counted using a Countess automated cell coun- ter (Thermo Fisher), and resuspended in fresh R10 to a den- sity of 5x10 6 cells/mL. For each condition, duplicate wells containing 1x106 cells in 200uL were plated in 96 -well round - bottom plates and rested overnight in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. After 16 hours, CD40 blocking antibody (0.5ug/mL final concentration) was added to cultures for 15 min prior t o stimulation. Cells were then stimulated for 24 hours with costimulation (anti analyses, CD8 -E for all CD8+ T cell analyses) at a final con- centration of 1 ug/mL. Peptide me gapools were prepared as previously described ( 51, 52). Matched unstimulated samples for each donor at each timepoint were treated with costimu- lation alone. 20 CD40L, CD107a, CXCR5, and CCR6 culture along with monensin (GolgiStop, BD Biosci-ences) for a 4 -hour stain at 37\u00b0C. After 4 hours, duplicate wells were pooled and cells were washed in PBS supple-mented with 2% FBS (FACS buffer). Cells were stained for 10 min at room temperature with Ghost Dye Violet 510 and Fc receptor blocking solution (Human TruStain FcX, Bio- Legend) and washed once in FACS buffer. Surface staining for 30 min at room temperature was then performed with antibodies directed were washed once in FACS buffer, fixed and permeabilized for 30 min at room temperature (eBioscience Foxp3 / Tran- scription Factor Fixation/Permeabilization Concentrate and Diluent), washed once Permeabilization Buffer prior to staining for intracellular IFN -g overnight at 4\u00b0C. Cells were then washed again and resuspended in 1% para-formaldehyde in PBS prior to data acquisition. All data from AIM expression assays were background - subtracted usin g paired unstimulated control samples. For memory T cell and helper T cell subsets, the AIM+ back- ground frequency of non -na\u00efve T cells was subtracted inde- pendently for each subset. AIM+ cells were identified from non-na\u00efve T cell populations. AIM+ CD4+ T c ells were de- fined by co- expression of CD200 and CD40L. AIM+ CD8+ T cells were defined by a Boolean analysis identifying cells ex- pressing at least four of five markers: Sorting Samples were acquired on a BD Symphony A5 instrument. Standardized SPHERO rainbow beads (Spherotech) were used to track and adjust photomultiplier tubes over time. Ul-traComp eBeads (Thermo Fisher) were used for compensa- tion. Up to 5x10 6 cells were acquired per sample. Data were analyzed using FlowJo v10 (BD Bioscience). For Boolean anal-ysis of variant cross- binding, data were imported into SPICE 6 (NIH Vaccine Research Center ( 55)). Cell sorting was per- formed on a BD FACS Aria II instrument in low pressure mode using a 70um nozzle. Cells were sorted into DNA LoBind Eppendorf tubes containing cell lysis buffer (Qiagen). B Cell Receptor Sequencing Library Preparation DNA was extracted from sorted cells using a Gentra Puregene Cell kit (Qiagen, family DNA samples using primers in FR1 and JH as described previously (47, 56). Two biological replicates were run on all samples. Sequencing was performed in the Human Immunology Core Facility at the University of Pennsylvania using an Illumina 2\u00d7 300 Reads from an Illumina MiSeq were filtered, annotated, and grouped into clones as d escribed previously ( 16, 57). Briefly, pRESTO v0.6.0 ( 58) was used to align paired end reads, re- move short and low -quality reads, and mask low -quality ba- ses with Ns to avoid skewing SHM and lineage analyses. Sequences which passed this process were aligned and anno- tated with IgBLAST v1.17.0 ( v0.29.10 ( 60, 61) for clonal inference, downstream pro- cessing. For clonal inference, sequences with the same IGHV gene, IGHJ gene, and CDR3 length from each donor were hi-erarchically clustered. Sequences with 85% or higher similar- ity in their CDR3 amino -acid sequence were subsequently grouped into clones. Clones with productive rearrangements and >= 2 copies were filtered for downstre am analysis. Lineage Construction & Visualization For each clone, a lineage was constructed with ImmuneDB as described in ( 61). ete3 ( 62) was used to visualize the lineages where each node represents a unique sequence, the size of a node represents its rel ative copy number fraction in the clone, and the integer next to each node represents the num- ber of mutations from the preceding vertical node. Overlapping Clone SHM Analysis Clones were filtered based on size using a copy number filter Downloaded from https://www.science.org on November 29, 2021 First release: 14 October 2021 science.org (Page numbers not final at time of first release ) 13 such that clones which had a copy number less than 50% of the mean copy number frequency (50% mcf) within the sub- ject were excluded. From this population, only clones that ap- peared in both WT RBD and cross -binder included. The SHM of ea ch clone was averaged across each unique sequence, weighted by the copies of each se-quence, and visualized as categorical variables (pie chart) and as frequencies (boxplots). Data Availability Raw sequencing data for all donors and subsets is available on SRA under BioProje ct PRJNA752617. Processed AIRR -seq data will be made available on the AIRR Data Commons via the iReceptor portal ( 63). Estimating Decay Rates To understand and compare the rate of loss of immune re- sponses after vaccination, w e tested different statistical mod- els of decay against the data. We first tested if there was significant decay (i.e., was the decay rate significantly differ- ent from zero). We then tested if there was evidence for a slowing of decay with time (using a two -phase model). This is a heuristic approach to understanding decay and does not imply a mechanism or that the underlying immune dynamics may be more complex. The decay rate post -second dose of vaccine was estimated using a censored mixed effect regres-sion framework. Briefly, the depende ncy of variables of inter- est on days post vaccine can be modeled by using either one constant decay slope or a decay slope that changes with time (assume a two - phase decay with a fixed break point at T 0). The model of the im mune response y for participant i at time tij can be written as below: yij = 0 + b0i + 1tij + b1itij - for a model with a single slope; and yij = 0 + b0i + 1tij + b1itij + 2sij - for a model with two different slopes, in w hich: 0 000, ,ij ij ij ijtT st Tt T<= The parameter 0 is a constant (global intercept), and b0i is a patient -specific adjustment (random effect) to the global intercep t. The slope parameter 1 is a fixed effect to capture the average decay rate for all individuals before T0; and b1i is a patient -specific random effect of the decay rate. To fit t he model with a two -phase decay slope (with break point at time T0), an extra parameter 2 (with a subject -specific random ef- fect b2i) was added to represent the difference between the two slopes. Throughout the manuscript, we chose the median of the ti mepoints post -second dose of vaccine as the break point i n decay rate (i.e., T0=day 89). To account for values less than the detection threshold in the assay, a censored mixed -effect regression method was used to estimate the parameters in the model. Valu es less than 10 were censored for the neutralization d ata. For T cell measurements, this detection threshold varies (see supple-mental information - determining the limit of detection for details on how this variable limit of detection was captured). The li near models above were fitted with censoring of values below the limit of detection using lmec library in R ( 64) (with the maximum likelihood algorithm option to fit for the fixed effects). We used a likelihood ratio test to determine if the response varia bles where better fit with either the single or two-phase decay models (by testing whether 2 = 0), and to test whether the decay rates were different between SARS - CoV-2 na\u00efve and recovered subjects (this test compares the likelihood value of the nested mod els and the difference in the number of parameters) . These analyses were carried out in R version 4.0.4. Determining the Limit of Detection for Estimating De- cay Rates For each individual and at each time point (i.e., each sample) the limit of detection in assays of T cell stimulation varied. This is because the background level is determined by run- ning paired assessment of cells from a given sample in (SARS - CoV-2 peptide) stimulated and unstimulated cultures. The quantify of interest (of which we wish to me asure the decay rate) is the difference in the frac tion of T cells activated in the stimulated and unstimulated cultures. The variable limit of detection (LOD) for each sample must be considered when determining the decay rate for T cell responses. To determine if the fraction of activated cells in a stimu lated sample was significantly higher than the fraction of activated cells in the corresponding unstimulated sample (i.e., if the sample was above the limit of detection) we used a one- sided two propor- tion Z test. Formally, we let the proportion of unstimu lated and stimulated responses (over total non -na\u00efve cells) be de- noted by U i,j and Si,j for patient i at time j, respectively. It fol- lows that we are interested in estimating the decay rate of the quantity i,j = Si,j Ui,j. A one -sided two proportion Z test was used to determine if Si,j > Ui,j. Briefly, for each patient i at time j, the following quantity was cells in stimulated group for sub- ject i at time j, Downloaded from https://www.science.org on November 29, 2021 First release: 14 October 2021 science.org (Page numbers not final at time of first release ) 14 ,ijun = total non- na\u00efve cells in unstimulate d group for subject i at time j. For each subject, we calculated the minimum difference needed to achieve significance by solving the above equation for i,j (assuming p is constant) at the Zcritical level (i.e., with =0.05, Zcritical=1.645 for a one -sided test). This + We censored subject i if the difference is not statistically significant ( i.e., Zi,j<1.645, with =0.05). The detection limit for subject i was calculated by taking the maximum value of ,ijMIN across all timepoint for that subject. The values i,j were normalized by the maximum ,ijMIN for each subject, hence the li mit of detection was set to zero, and the lmec re- gression models applied to the normalized data in order to determine the decay rates of T cell responses. High Dimensional Analysis and Statistics All data were analyzed using custom scripts in R and visual- ized using RStudio . Pairwise correlations between visualized as a correlogram using cor- rplot with FDR correction as described previously ( 65). For heatmaps, data were visualized with pheatmap. For construc- tion of UMAPs, 12 of Spike+ memory B, % and cell frequency data were log10 transformed and scaled by column (z -score normalization) prior to generating UMAP co- ordinates. Statistical tests are indicated in the corresponding figure legends. All tests were performed two -sided with a nominal signif icance threshold of p < 0.05. Benjamini - Hochberg (BH) correction was performed in all cases of mul-tiple comparisons. Unpaired tests were used for comparisons between timepoints unless otherwise indicated as some par-ticipants were missing samples from indiv idual timepoints. * indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01, *** indicates p < 0.001, **** indicates p < 0.0001.
