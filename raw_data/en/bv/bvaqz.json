This systematic review was conducted as part of the Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project (P/B-24 Project ) by USDA's Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR). The purpose of the P/B -24 Project was to conduct a series of systematic reviews on diet and health for women who are pregnant and for infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months of age. This project was a joint initiati ve led by USDA and HHS, and USDA's NESR carried out all of the systematic reviews. A Federal Expert Group (FEG), a broa dly representative group of Federal researchers and program leaders , also provided input throughout the P/B -24 Project. More information about the P/B -24 Project has been publishedii and is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/project -specif ic- overview -pb-24-0 NESR, formerly the Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL), specializes in conducting food - and nutrition -related systematic reviews using a rigorous , protocol -driven methodology . To conduct each P/B -24 systematic review, NESR's staff worked with a Technical Expert Collaborative (TEC) , which is a group of 7 -8 leading subject matter experts . NESR's systematic review methodology involves developing and prioritizing systematic review questions, searching for and selecting studies, extracting and assessing the risk of bias of data from each included study, synthesizing the evidence, developing a conclusion statement, grading the evidence underlying the conclusion statement, and recommending future research. A detailed description of the methodolog y used in conducting systematic reviews for the P/B -24 Project has been publishediii and is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/pb -24-project -methodology -0. In addition, starting on page 49, this document includes details about the methodolo gy as it was applied to the systematic review described herein. An analytic framework that illustrates the overall scope of the question, including the population, the interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outcomes of interest, is found on page 49.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMA RY What is the question? The question is: What is the relationship between the timing of introduction of complementary foods and beverages (CF B) and growth, size, and body composition? What is the answer to the question ? Moderate evidence suggests that first introducti on of any CFB between 4 -5mo compared to approximately 6mo of age is not associated with weight status, body composition, body cir cumferences, weight, or length among generally healthy, full -term infants. Limited evidence suggests that introducing CFB before 4mo of age may be associated with higher odds of overweight/obesity. There is not enough evidence to determine the relationshi p between introduction of CFB at 7mo of age or older on growth, size, or body composition. Why was this question asked? This important public health question was identified and prioritized as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of He alth and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project. How was this question answered? A team of Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review staff conducted a systematic review in collaboration with a group of experts called a Technical Expert Collabor ative What is the population of interest? Generally healthy infants and toddlers who were fed complementary foods and beverages from ages 0 -24mo and had growth, size, and/or body composition outcomes measured across the lifespan What evidence was found? Eighty -one articles examined the association between timing of introduction of CFB, as early as 1mo and as late as 12mo of age, and growth, size, and/or body composition outcomes across the lifespan In the majority of studies, no significant associations were reported. A limited number of observational studies suggested that CFB introduction before age 4mo was associated with higher odds of overweight/obesity. No conclusion was drawn regarding the introduction of CFB at 7mo or older. Limitations in the evi dence included inconsistency among all studies and a preponderance of null findings 10 How up -to-date is this review? This review includes literature from 01/1980 to 07/2016 11 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background Systematic reviews were conducted as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the following question: What is the relationship between timing of introduction of compl ementary foods and beverages (CFB) and growth, size, and body composition? Complementary feeding is the process that starts when human milk or infant formula is complemented by other foods and beverages, beginning during infancy and typically continuing to 24 months of age. CFB were defined as foods and/or beverages other than human milk or infant formula (liquids, semisolids, and solids) provided to an infant or young child to provide nutrients and energy. Conclusion Statement and Grades Moderate evidence suggests that first introduction of any complementary food or beverage (CFB) between 4 -5 months compared to approximately 6 months of age is not associated with weight status, body composition, body circumferences, weight, or length among generally health y, full -term infants. Grade: Moderate Limited evidence suggests that introducing CFB before 4 months of age may be associated with higher odds of overweight/obesity. Grade: Limited There is not enough evidence to determine the relationship between introduc tion of CFB at 7 months of age or older on growth, size, or body composition. Grade: Grade Not Assignable Methods This systematic review was conducted by a team of staff from the Nutrition Evidence Library in collaboration with a Technical Expert Collabor ative. Literature search was conducted using 4 databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and CINAHL) to identify articles that evaluated the intervention or exposure of timing of CFB introduction and the outcomes of developmental milestones. A manual search wa s conducted to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were screened by two analysts? independently for inclusion based on pre -determined criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were c onducted for each included study, and both were checked for accuracy. The body of evidence was qualitatively synthesized to inform development of a conclusion statement(s), and the strength of evidence was graded using pre -established criteria evaluating t he body of evidence on risk of bias, adequacy, consistency, impact, and generalizability. Summary of Evidence This review includes 81 articles that examined the association between timing of introduction of CFB and growth, size, and/or body composition acr oss the 12 lifespan Timing of CFB introduction is the age at which any or specific types of CFB were first consumed and was examined as early as 1 month and as late as 12 months of age. Timing of CFB introduction was not associated with growth, size, body composition, and/or weight status in the majority of included studies. A limited number of observational studies suggested that CFB introduction before 4 months of age was associated with higher odds of overweight/obesity. Given the normal variation in heal thy child gro wth patterns, caution should be used when interpreting results between timing, types and/or amounts of CFB and outcomes for individuals based on findings at the population level. 13 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the relationship between timing of introduction of complementary foods and beverages and growth, size, and body composition? Conclusion statement Moderate evidence suggests that first introduction of any complementary food or beverage (CFB) between 4 -5 months compared to approximately 6 months of age is not associated with weight status, body composition, body circumferences, weight, or length among generally healthy, full -term infants. Limited evidence suggests that introducing CFB before 4 months of age may be associat ed with higher odds of overweight/obesity. There is not enough evidence to determine the relationship between introduction of CFB at 7 months of age or older on growth, size, or body composition. Grade s Moderate - Introduction of CFB between 4 -5 compared t o 6 months of age Limited - Introduction of CFB before 4 months of age Grade Not Assignable - Introduction of CFB at 7 months of age or older Summary This review includes 81 articles that examined the association between timing of complementary foods and b everages (CFB) introduction and growth, size, and/or body composition from birth through adulthood, including: o Five articles from two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) o 71 prospective cohort studies o One retrospective cohort study o One nested case -contr ol study o Three case -control studies Timing of CFB introduction is the age at which any or specific types of CFB were first consumed and was examined as early as 1 month and as late as 12 months of age. Studies that examined the introduction of specific t ypes or amounts of CFB are addressed in a separate review. Outcomes included weight, length/height, body circumferences (e.g., head, waist, chest, arm, thigh), adiposity (e.g., fat mass, skinfold thickness), weight -to- height ratio (e.g., body mass index ( BMI), weight -for-length Z -score (WLZ)), and weight status (e.g., risk of overweight or obesity). Outcomes were assessed at a range of ages from birth to 42y of age a t either a single, pre -determined time point or at multiple time points or as continuous va riables to capture change over time. Having data both before and after introduction of CFB is very important, as outcomes that do not take into account the infant's initial anthropometric status (before any CFB are introduced) are hard to interpret (e.g., risk of reverse causation) 14 Timing of CFB introduction was not associated with growth, size, body composition, and/or weight status in the majority of included studies. A limited number of observational studies suggested that CFB introduction before 4 m onths of age was associated with higher odds of overweight/obesity. However, due to inconsistency in findings and methodological limitations, a stronger conclusion was not made considering the preponderance of studies with null findings. There is insuffic ient evidence to support any association between timing of CFB introduction and body circumferences among generally healthy, full -term infants. Given the normal variation in healthy child growth patterns, caution should be used when interpreting results b etween timing, types and/or amounts of CFB and outcomes for individuals based on findings at the population level. Many studies examined the relationship between timing of CFB introduction and only one outcome, primarily weight, which, without informatio n about other aspects of growth (i.e., length/height, or weight for length/height), provided limited information towards understanding how timing of CFB introduction may impact overall growth patterns. Therefore, studies that examined multiple outcomes, in cluding outcomes that could be used to determine whether growth was healthy or unhealthy (e.g., risk of obesity, fat mass) were weighted more heavily in drawing conclusions from the body of evidence. Additional factors, which may mediate or moderate the r elationship between the time at which CFB are introduced and growth, size, body composition, and/or weight status outcomes need to be considered including: o Specific types and/or amounts of CFB introduced o Early infant milk feeding practices (human milk, fo rmula, and/or mixed) o Parental feeding styles and the rationale for determin ing when to initiate CFB (e.g., perceived infant readiness, infant growth or size, fear of inadequate milk supply, sleep promotion, responsive feeding, infant food neophobia/accepta nce) o Early infant growth patterns o Cultural preference related to parental history and/or feeding practices Description of the evidence This systematic review includes 81 articles that examined the association between the timing of introduction to CFB an d growth, size, body composition, and/or weight status from infancy through adulthood . These articles include two RCTs, which are reported in five articles (1-5); 71 prospective cohort studies (6-76), one retrospective cohort study (77), one nested case -control study (78), and three case -control studies (79-81) (Supplemental Table S1). Multiple articles reported data from the same cohort but presented different types of outcomes, the same outcomes at different ages, or 15 different outcomes at different ages (21, 24, 25, 30, 49, 51, 56, 60) (9, 18, 19, 63) (10, 12, 28, 31, 32, 35, 57) . Description of subject characteristics Sixty -eight articles were from studies conducted in countries categorized as \"very high\" according to the Human Development Index, which is a composite measure of life expectancy, education, and standards of living of countries (82): Australia (8, 29, 62, 68); Canada (27, 42 -45, 58, 75) ; Denmark (11, 20, 61) ; Finland (50, 59) ; Germany (40); Iceland (2-5, 38) ; Ireland (48); Israel (22); Norway (46); Netherlands (9, 17 -19, 63); U.K. (10, 21, 31 -33, 35, 39, 49, 56, 57, 60, 66, 67, 70) ; Scotland (6, 26) ; U.S. (1, 7, 12 -14, 16, 23 -25, 28, 30, 36, 37, 47, 51, 53, 55, 71, 73, 74, 77, 79) . Nine studies were conducted in countries categorized as \"high\" according to the Human Develop ment Index (82): Brazil (52, 64) ; China (76, 80, 81) ; Iran (41); Mexico (15, 65) ; Peru (54). Four multi -site studies were co nducted with participants from various countries. Two studies included participants from European countries all categorized as \"very high\" (34, 78) , one study included participants from three countries categorized as \"very high\" or \"high\" (72), and one study combined participants from seven countries categorized as \"very high\", \"high\", \"medium\", and \"low\" (69). The majority of studies included participants who were health y, full -term infants, though six prospective cohort studies did not report gestational age and birthweight of participants (15, 21, 62, 66, 70, 71) . Almost all studies enrolled both girls and boys (~43-55% female), with one study including only girls (23). Studies varied in terms of whether infants were fed human milk, infant formula, or both. Most studies included participants regardless of their feeding method and adjusted for feeding m ethod in the analyses. However, several studies only included infants who were either exclusively breastfed (EBF ) (2-5, 41, 55, 64, 69) or exclusively formula -fed (EFF ) (1, 33, 73, 74) . In a few studies, the relationship between timing of CFB introduction and growth, size, and/or body composition was analyzed separately in BF and FF infants (14, 36, 37) . Description of timing of int roduction of complementary foods and beverages Timing of CFB introduction was determined as the age at which CFB was first introduced. However, studies differed in terms of whether timing was analyzed categorically or continuously, what categories of ages were evaluated and compared, and the methods used for determining age of CFB introduction, whether prospectively or retrospectively. For specific time points of exposures, see Supplemental Table 1 . One RCT (reported in 4 articles) randomized EBF infants t o either receive CFB starting at 4 mo of age or remain EBF from 4 until 6 mo of age (2-5). The second RCT randomized EFF infants to either receive CFB at age 16 wk, or remain EFF from 16 to 26 wk of age (1). Sixty -three observational studies analyzed age of CFB introduction categorically, often considering introduction of CFB before 4 mo as the earliest category and at/after 6mo as the latest category. Categories of timing of CFB introduction varied across studies, which examined two ( e.g., <4 mo vs. at/after 4 mo of age), three (e.g., <2 vs. 3 -5 vs. >6 mo), or four (1 -8 vs. 9 -16 vs. 17 -24 vs. 25 -32 wk) comparison groups. Few articles attempted to achieve greater specificity in terms of timing by further differentiating categories of CF B introduction within the 4 -6 mo 16 timeframe. There were a number of studies that examined more extreme categories of introducing CFB a s early as 1 mo (44, 56) or 2mo (49, 68, 69, 75) to as late as at/after 12 mo of age (15). Timing of CFB introduction was analy zed continuously in 16 studies (7, 14, 16, 24, 25, 42, 43, 45, 50, 61, 62, 65, 66, 72 -74). Several studies examined timing of CFB introduction both continuously and categorically (24, 34, 36, 45, 50, 61) . Two studies did not clearly define their methods for analyzing timing of CFB introduction (27, 57) . Description of growth, size, and body composition outcomes Outcomes that were reported in relation to timing of CFB introduction ranged in age from birth to 42 y (see Supplemental Table S1). As defined by the included studies, outcomes relevant to 'growth' were examined over multiple time -points or intervals betw een baseline and endpoint of the study, outcomes relevant to 'size' were examined as an absolute measurement at one point in time, and 'body composition' outcomes were examined via proxies or indices, both across time and at single time points. Studies var ied in how they accounted for growth beyond absolute size, such as by measuring outcomes at or across multiple time points, adjusting for baseline weight or earlier growth, or adjusting for birth weight. Therefore, the outcomes are discussed in the followi ng categories, utilized herein to describe the included evidence: weight status, body composition (including adiposity, weight relative to length/height, and waist circumference (WC)); weight and length or height measures; and body circumferences (except w aist). Weight status Twenty -eight articles in this SR (1 RCT; 27 from observational studies) reported weight status (2, 6, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 25, 30, 35, 37, 45, 48, 50 -53, 56, 58, 61, 62, 68, 76 - 81). The relationships between timing of introduction of CFB and incidence of malnutrition, growth faltering, stunting, or wasting were not reported by studies included in this SR. The majority of studies published after 2007 u sed either BMI and/or BMI z -score (BMIZ) to classify participants older than 2 y of age as having obesity if 95th percentile or overweight if 85th percentile. However, cut -points varied slightly across studies according to international standard referenc es at the time the studies were conducted or respective country growth references (e.g., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), International Obesity Task Force (IOTF), World Health Organization (WHO), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS )). One study classified obesity as a weight -for-age at or above the 98th percentile and computed models based on child BMI to compare with WHO, CDC, and IOTF cut -offs (30). In another study, risk of overweight was defined as having a BMI 85th percentile, and obesity was defined as having a of BMI 85th percentile and skinfolds Body c omposition Adiposity. Nineteen articles in this SR (2 from RCTs; 17 from observational studies) assessed adiposity with measures of fat mass (FM) or skinfold thickness (1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 14, 17 -20, 37, 42, 43, 49, 57, 67, 70 , 75, 77) . A wide variety of assessment methods were used including dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA) to derive FM, FM index (FMI), lean mass, lean mass index, and/or body fat percentage (18, 49, 57, 77), total body water to obtain FM, fat free mass (FFM), and/or lean mass (5, 67) , bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to calculate body fat percentage (70), or a combination of DXA, total body water, and/or bioelectrical impedance to calculate FM, 17 FFM, FMI, FFMI, FM z -score (FMZ), or FFM z (FFMZ) (14, 17, One article used DXA to examine android -gynoid fat ratio (18). Studies used calipers by trained staff to measure triceps and subscapular (1, 9, 10, 14, 19, 67) , suprailiac (1, 9, 19) , bicep (19), and/or flank quadriceps skinfold thicknesses (14), or sum of skinfold thicknesses (7, 9, 19, 37, 42, 43, 75) . Weight -to-height. Twenty -nine articles in this SR (2 from RCTs; 27 from observational studies) assessed weight -to-height indices such as BMI and weight -for-length z -score (WLZ) (2, 5, 7, 17, 18, 21, 23, 29, 3 3, 34, 36 -38, 42 -44, 46, 55, 57, 60, 61, 63, 64, 68, 70-72, 76, 77) , with most using standard procedures to calculate BMI or WLZ from measurements. Several studies used weight and length or height from parent -report (76), clinical/school records (46, 81) , a combination of measurements and self -report (61), or did not describe how they obtained weight and length/height (6). Waist circumference (WC)/abdominal fat. Five articles in this SR (1 RCT; 4 from observational studies) assessed abdominal fat and/or WC via ultrasound (18), measured WC (1, 15), self -reported WC (61), or by calculating a sum of core skinfold thickness measures to reflect 'central FM' (19). Weight and length or height Twenty -eight articles in this SR (4 from RCTs; 24 from observational studies) examined both weight and length or height outcomes (1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 23, 33, 34, 36 -38, 41, 44, 47, 55, 59, 64, 65, 67, 69 -72). The majority of studie s reported growth and/or size outcomes at or in the first year of life, though five studies reported growth and/or size during the second year of life and four studies reported growth and/or size during childhood, between 2 -7 y of age. Most studies reporte d using standard procedures to obtain weight and height, (e.g., duplicate measures from calibrated scales/stadiometers). However, a few studies obtained weight and/or length via parent -report (11, 28, 39) , clinical /school records (47, 71) , unstandardized methods (44), or did not describe their methods (1, 33) . Nine studies calculated weight -for-age z scores (WAZ) and eight studies calculated height/length -for-age z -scores (HAZ/LAZ) from either measured or reported weight and/or length. Head, arm, and thigh c ircumference Eight studies reported head circumference growth and/or size (1-5, 13, 14, 44) . Two of these studies also reported chest, arm, and thigh circumferences (1, 14) . Most studies reported using standard procedures to obtain head, arm, or thigh circu mferences (e.g., non-stretchable tape and standard landmarks). Evidence s ynthesis Results from the included studies, organized by study design and similar outcomes, are described in Table 1. Randomized controlled tria ls In the RCTs, EBF infants (2-5) were randomized to start receiving CFB at 4 vs. 6 mo of age or EFF infants were randomized to start receiving CFB at 16 wk vs. 26 wk of age (1). Results from four articles (one RCT) among BF infants (2-5) showed no significant associations between timing of CFB and weight, length, or HC at 6 mo (5), from 0 -6 mo, or from 4 -6 mo (4); BMI, lean mass, or FM at 6 mo (5); WAZ/LAZ at 18 mo or change in WAZ/LAZ from 29 -38 mo (2); weight status at 18 mo or from 29 -38 mo (2); HC z -score at 6 mo (5), HC or HC -for-age at 18 mo (2, 3) ; or change in HC from 29 -38 18 mo (2). In the trial with EFF infa nts, timing of CFB was examined relative to weight, length, adiposity, and body circumference outcomes (1). Significant findings were reported for isolated outcomes. The EFF infants who were introduced to CFB at 16 wk vs. 16 -26 wk had increased change in length and a smaller decrease in suprailiac skinfold thickness from 16 -26 wk of age. Notably, groups significantly differed in length by 1cm at baseline and these differences were not clearly accounted for so the results should be interpreted with caution. Further, the groups did not differ in length at 26 wk. No other significant differences between groups were found in relation to additional outcomes including total skinfold thickness, or change in skinfold thickness, weight, or body circumferences from 16 -26 wk of age. Sever al of these articles from both RCTs (1, 4, 5) reported outcomes a t or before 26 wk of age, when accumulation of FM is maximal relative to body weight, which makes drawing a stronger conclusion on inadequate or exce ssive growth, size, body composition, and/or weight status difficult without additional follow -up measurements over time. Observational studies Weight status Twenty -seven articles from observational studies examined the relationship between timing of CFB introduction and weight status outcomes (6, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 25, 30, 35, 37, 45, 48, 50 -53, 56, 58, 61, 62, 68, 76 -81). About half of these 27 articles reported no a ssociation between timing of CFB introduction and weight status, such that early introduction of CFB (primarily <4 mo of age) was not significantly associated with risk of overweight/obesity during childhood, at ages ranging between 2 -14 y (12, 15, 18, 21, 25, 45, 48, 50, 52, 56, 58, 77, 78, 80) . The remaining articles reported significant negative associations between timing of CFB and weight status, such that earlier introduction of CFB (pri marily <4 mo of age although timing of CFB varied) was significantly associated with higher weight status (6, 30, 35, 37, 51, 53, 61, 62, 68, 76, 79, 81) . Higher odds of overweight/obesity in those with earlier CFB introduction were observed primarily in childhood between 2 -6 y of age (range of 2 -42 y). Several articles included multiple comparison groups (e.g., introduction of CFB <4, 4 -6, >6 mo) but found higher odds of overweight/obesity only for those who were i n the earliest CFB introduction group (6, 37, 51, 68, 76, 81) . A few of these articles reported additional null associations, depending on the comparison group and/or age of outcome. Across the studies that examin ed timing of CFB introduction relative to weight status outcomes, there was heterogeneity in categories of CFB introduction, age of outcome assessment (ranging from 2 -42 y), methods used for outcome assessment (e.g., weight status derived from either measu red vs. reported weight and height), and variable cut -offs for either BMI or BMIZ to classify obesity and/or overweight separately or as one \"above healthy\" category of weight status. Two studies examined age of introduction of sugar -sweetened beverages (S SBs) specifically rather than CFB generally (15, 53) .Very few of these studies examined other outcomes that may help with interpretation of weight status. For instance, some articles that examined timing of introdu ction of CFB in relation to weight status also examined timing of CFB in relation to adiposity (18, 37, 77) and/or weight (37, 48, 50) . Most of those studies found no significant association between timing of CFB and adiposity during childhood (3 -6 y) or weight during the first 3 y of life. One study showed no significant association between 19 timing of CFB introduction (either <4, <5, or <6 vs. 6 mo) and weight status at 3 y but observed increased weight at 9 mo (48). Huh et al. reported that earlier CFB introduction (<4 vs. 4 -5 mo but not vs. 6 mo) in FF infants was associated with increased weight status, BMI, BMIZ, and WAZ at 3 y but results in BF infants were null (37). In either BF or FF infants in that study, timing of CFB was not significantly associated with skinfold thickness at 3 y. Studies also varied in adjusting the results for potentially key confounding factors. For example, all of the articles that reported significant results adjusted for birth weight, but did not consistently adjust for baseline weight, length or other measures of weight status. In addition, studies varied in the magnitude of observed effects. Body composition Adiposity. Seventeen observational studies examined the relationship between timing of CFB introduction and adiposity outcomes (7, 9, 10, 14 , 17-20, 37, 42, 43, 49, 57, 67, 70, 75, 77) , of which the majority reported no significant association between timing of CFB introduction and adiposity outcomes in childhood (ag e ranges between 6 mo and 15 y), including skinfold thickness, FM and FFM, le an mass and FM indices, and percentage of body fat (7, 9, 10, 14, 18, 20, 37, 43, 49, 57, 67, 75, 77) . Three of the 17 articles reported significant negative associations between timing of CFB and either skinfold t hickness at 12 mo (52) or 24 mo (19), or body fat percentage at 7 y (70), One of the 17 articles also reported a negative association such that later CFB introduction > 6 m o vs. < 4 mo was associated with lower FMZ at 5 -6y, but this was no longer significant in the final model (17). These studies (4 of 17) found no significant associations when examining other related outcomes (e.g., peripheral FM at 24 mo (19), BMI at 12 mo (42), FFMI at 5 -6 y (17)). Across the studies that assessed timing of CFB relative to adiposity, a number of studies had substantial methodological limitations such as limited generalizability from using a very early (<4 mo) age of introduction of CFB (10, 17, 49, 57, 67, 70, 75, 77) . Several examined additional outcomes in cluding weight -to-height ratios, weight, length, and/or central adiposity (7, 10, 14, 17, 19, 37, 43, 57, 67, 70, 77) . Of those studies that examined additional outcomes, the results for adiposity outcomes were primarily null and inconsistent in terms of direction and/or sub -group of interest (e.g., FF vs. BF) relative to other outcomes. For example, Agras et al. (7) found that age of (continuous) introduction of CFB was not significantly associated with skinfold thickness at any age but delayed introduction was positively associated with BMI at 1, 2, and 3 y of age. However, it is unclear what drove those findings with respect to BMI because Agras et al. (7) did not report weight or height outcomes. Baird et al. (10) found null results between timing of CFB (<3, at 3, at 4 vs. 5 mo) and both adiposity and weight from birth -6 mo of age, but found that timing of CFB ( at 3 vs. 5 mo) was associated with gain in length from birth -6 mo of age. There was substantial varia tion in the adiposity outcomes reported and corresponding assessment methods. For example, some studies reported FM measured via DXA or bioelectrical impedance while others reported FM via sum of skinfold thickness. There were no clear patterns observed ba sed on the technique used to measure of adiposity. Weight -to-height. Twenty -seven articles from observational studies examined the relationship between timing of CFB introduction and weight -to-height outcomes (7, 17, 18, 21, 23, 29, 33, 34, 36 -38, 42 -44, 46, 55, 57, 60, 61, 63, 64, 68, 70 -72, 76, 77) of which the majority reported no significant associations between timing of CFB 20 introduction and BMI or BMIZ mostly in early childhood (ages r anged between 2 and 11.5 y) . Several of the 27 observational studies reported inconsistent but significant associations between timing of CFB and/or BMI, BMIZ, or WLZ. Most of the significant findings identified were negative associations, with earlier CF B introduction significantly associated with higher BMI at 3 y (37), 4-5 y (76), and 42 y (61), BMIZ at 36 mo (34), and WLZ from 9 -12 mo (44). However, across the studies with significant findings, a few positive, null, and/or mixed associations were also reported (7, 33, 34, 55). See Table 2 for more details. Grote et al. (33) reported a significant negative association between timing of CFB introduction (13 vs. 22 wk) and BMI -for-age trajectory until 24 mo but found no relationship relative to WL Z, BMI or BMIZ at 24 mo of age. Notably, most of the studies with significant associations (in either direction) compared groups of CFB introduction at either very early ages such as <4 mo relative to various other ages, or at unique ages such as 9 mo. In addition, most of the studies with any significant finding relative to weight -to-height indices had substantial methodological limitations such as limited generalizability and potential for reverse causality. Across the studies that examined timing of int roduction of CFB and weight -to-height, there was heterogeneity in terms of: age of outcome assessment (6 mo - 42 y), methods used for outcome assessment (e.g., BMI obtained from measured vs. self - reported weight and height), type of CFB introduced (e.g., j uice, cereal, meat), and which potential key confounders were adjusted for in analyses. For instance, the majority adjusted for birth weight in addition to baseline anthropometric values but did not account for maternal age, gestational age, or parental we ight/height status in analyses. Most of the studies that examined weight -to-height indices examined additional outcomes, such as adiposity, weight, and/or length or height. Many, but not all, of those studies examined weight and/or length or height outcome s at the same or different ages. Results were inconsistent across these studies for weight -to-height indices and weight. For example, although Grote et al. (33) found no significant association of timing of introdu ction of CFB with respect to BMI, WLZ, or BMIZ at 24 mo, those who were introduced to CFB earlier vs. later (13 vs. 14 -17 wk) or later vs. earlier (18 -21 vs. 14 -17 wk) had higher WAZ at 24 mo of age. Haschke et al. (34) reported that EBF infants introduced to CFB <4 mo compared to those who remained EBF from 4 -6 mo had lower BMIZ at each mo assessed (between 1 and 36 mo of age), and lower WAZ at 3, 4, 5, and 6 mo of age, but no significant association with WAZ at y ounger or older ages (birth, 1, 2, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, or 36 mo). In addition, Haschke also reported significant positive correlations between age of CFB introduction and BMI gain (kg/m2/y) and weight gain (g/mo) from 1 -12 mo, but these associations were no t significant for outcomes from 1 -24 mo or 1 -36 mo of age. A few studies examined only weight -to-height (length) indices, all of which had null findings (29, 46, 60, 63) . Because weight -to-height indices are a pro xy for body composition, results from these studies are difficult to interpret given the different implications of body composition early in infancy/childhood as opposed to adulthood. Weight -to-height indices, such as BMI, alone provide limited information without other relevant outcomes (e.g., weight status, adiposity, weight and length outcomes). Waist circumference (WC)/Abdominal fat. Four observational articles examined the 21 relationship between timing of CFB introduction and central adiposity outcomes (15, 18, 19, 61) , of which three reported no significant associations with WC at 24 mo or 42 y, or abdominal fat at 6 y or 8 -14 y (15, 18, 19, 61) . Earlier CFB introductio n, measured continuously, was associated with increased WC at 42 y in one study (61). However, that study had substantial methodological limitations including use of non - standardized anthropometric assessments (e.g., self -report) and limited gene ralizability due to CFB practices at the time of original data collection (e.g., 1959 - 1960). Two of the studies had very long time to follow -up at 8 -14 y and 42 y and reported associations for categories of age of CFB introduction at very early (<4 mo) or very late (<12 mo) ages (15, 61) . Across these four observational studies, there was variability in terms of methods used to measure central adiposity, age of outcome assessment and methodological limitations. Weig ht and length/height Twenty -four articles from observational studies examined the relationship between timing of CFB introduction and both weight and length or height outcomes (8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 23, 33, 34, 36 -38, 41, 44, 47, 55, 59, 64, 65, 67, 69 -72), of which the majority (16 studies) reported at least one significant association with weight and/or length (8, 10, 13, 16, 1 7, 33, 34, 36 -38, 44, 55, 59, 65, 69, 70) and eight reported null findings for both weight and length (14, 23, 41, 47, 64, 67, 71, 72) . Of the articles that found significant relationships, the direction of findin gs was inconsistent. In eight of the 24 studies, there were no significant associations between timing of CFB relative to length/height (13, 16, 36, 37, 39, 55, 65, 70) , but either positive (13, 55) or negative associations relative to weight (36, 37, 39, 65, 70) . Several observational studies found negative associations between timing of CFB and length/height, such that either earlier introduction of CFB was associated with greater length/height, or later introduction of CFB was associated with shorter length/height (18, 20, 27, 69 (8, 17) , but found either no significant association with wei ght (10, 59) or negative associations with weight (8, 17) . The studies with mixed findings also varied based on the timing of CFB introduction, age at which outcome was ass essed, or the type of CFB introduced. Across the studies that examined the relationship between timing of introduction of CFB and weight and length/height, most studies also examined the relationship between timing of CFB introduction and at least one oth er relevant outcome with potential health implications (e.g., obesity, adiposity, weight -to-height indices). Huh et al. examined obesity at age 3 y in addition to weight, length, weight -to-height ratios, and adiposity outcomes (37). As noted in the section on weight status results, all of the significant associations that Huh et al. identified were found in FF infants, and no associations were found in BF infants (when comparing CFB introduction <4 vs. 4 -5 mo, or 6 vs. 4 -5 mo). Other articles also examined adiposity outcomes, in addition to weight and length (10, 14, 17, 67, 70) . A few studies shared the same direction of findings for weight and adiposity but the findings ac ross these studies were inconsistent in terms of direction, age of outcome assessment (e.g., weight at 6 -12 mo but adiposity at 5 -6 y), and specific timing interval for CFB introduction. For example, Wilson et al. (70 (Wilson, 1998 #105) found a negative association between timing of CFB (<15 vs. >15 wk) and weight as well as FM at 7 y, but found no relationship with height at 7 y. deBeer et al. (17) found that timing of CFB (<4 vs. >6 mo) was negatively associated with conditional weight at 6 -12 mo, height at 6 -12 mo, and FMZ at 5 -6 y, but the association with FMZ at 5 -6y was no longer significant after fully adjusting models and there were no associations with other outcome s (e.g., BMIZ, FFMZ). 22 Head, arm, and thigh circumference Timing of CFB introduction was not significantly associated with head circumference (HC) in most of the articles in this SR that examined body circumferences (8 articles total: 3 from observational studies discussed here and 5 from 2 RCTs previously discussed). These null findings were observed at various ages, ranging from approximately 6 mo to ~3 y of age, and when HC was examined at a single time point, or when change in HC over time was considere d. One observational study (44) reported that introduction of cereal at 3mo of age, but not at 6 or 9 mo, was associated with lower HC from 3 -6 mo. Notably, cereals consumed in that study were not representative of infant cereals consumed in the U.S. and only 1.2% of the children were consuming cereals at 3 mo. In addition, that study is limited by the potential for reverse causality and use of unstandardized anthropometric assessments. Only two studies in this SR, one from an RCT previously discussed and one observational study, examined other circumferences (arm, thigh, and chest); differences between groups were not significant at 26 wk, from 16 -26 wk, or between 6-24 mo of age (1, 14) . Although these two studies had minimal methodological limitations, they varied in study design and assessment of timing of CFB. 23 Table 1.

The independent variable/exposure of interest included timing of CFB introduction. 2. Outcomes were categorized in accordance with the analytical framework (also see Figure 1). Results were extracted from multivariate -adjusted analyses wherever possible rather than univariate analyses, crude, and/or unadjusted measures. Standard deviation (SD) or standard err or of the mean (SE) are indicated. Abbreviations: CFB, complementary food/beverage; BF, breast no associations; NSGD, no significant group differences; SD, standard deviation; SE, standard error of the mean 41 Discussion Moderate evidence suggests that first introduction of any CFB between 4 -5 mo compared to approximately 6 mo of age is not associated with differences in weight status, body composition, body circumferences, weight or length among generally healthy, full -term infants. Limited evidence suggests that introducing CFB before 4 mo of age may be associated with higher odds of overweight/obesity. There is not enough evidence to determine the relationship between introduction of CFB at > 7 mo of age on growth, size, or body composition. With the exception of the five included articles from two RCTs, which have a stronge r study design relative to the observational studies, little evidence was provided to permit evaluation of causal relationships between timing of CFB introduction and growth, size, body composition, and/or weight status. The majority of included evidence c ame from prospective cohort studies (71 of 81 articles). Authors of three articles (both RCTs) noted limitations regarding sample size (1-3). Many of the observational studies (35 of 75) did not account for high ra tes of attrition/missing data but some did have large sample sizes to investigate the relationship between timing of introduction to CFB and growth, size, body composition, and/or weight status. The majority of studies included in this SR were consistent across the body of evidence in terms of direction and statistical significance of findings, reporting no significant association between timing of CFB introduction and outcomes in terms of weight status (14 of 28 articles), body composition ( adiposity: 14 of 19 articles, weight - to-height: 19 of 29 articles, and central adiposity: 4 of 5 articles), weight and length/height (18 of 28 articles), and/or head, arm, or thigh circumferences (7 of 8 articles). The evidence is strongest for studies examining introdu ction of CFB at approximately age 4 mo compared to 6 mo, which includes two RCTs (1-5). For the remaining observational studies that make up the body of evidence, there were considerable methodological limitations and inconsistencies in both the magnitude of observed effects and direction of findings. There was sufficient consistency among the observational studies reporting higher odds of overweight/obesity or weight when comparing very early (<4 mo) relative to la ter CFB introduction (various time points), such that a limited conclusion was warranted. Few studies examining growth, size, and/or body composition made an attempt to more specifically differentiate introduction at 4-5 vs. 6 mo of age. Combining particip ants into categories such as CFB 6 mo made comparisons across the body of evidence difficult, such that no conclusion was drawn regarding the introduction of CFB at age 7 mo or older. There was also inconsistency across studies in the body of evidence wi th respect to several factors: milk-feeding practices, the specific type of CFB that were introduced, the specific age interval when CFB were introduced, w hich outcomes were considered, and the age at which the outcome was measured. Most studies in this SR directly examined timing of introduction of CFB and the outcomes of interest but varied in practical/clinical significance. Consideration of a broader -spectrum of growth -related outcomes than were included in many of the studies in this body of evidence m ay have led to stronger conclusions. For example, studies that examined weight status tended to report only weight status and not multiple outcomes, which would have provided important contextual information to aid 42 in the interpretation of weight status re sults. Any relationships observed within this body of evidence must be interpreted with caution, as earlier (i.e., human milk/infant formula) and later (toddler) feeding practices associated with CFB introduction may have stronger influences on growth, siz e, body composition, and/or weight status. Overall, there was good generalizability with respect to the U.S. population. However, several studies were conducted in populations that were less similar to the U.S. population. For example, studies conducted i n Israel, Peru, and Brazil enrolled participants, who either migrated from other countries with lower HDI or were from very disadvantaged populations (22, 54, 64, 68) . In addition, some studies were less relevant t o the U.S. due to differences in complementary feeding practices at the time the study was conducted and/or because they examined specific CFB that are less prominent as typical CFB in the U.S (15, 61, 76) . Limita tions A primary methodological limitation across the observational studies was the variability in controlling for confounding factors. The majority of observational studies did not account for more than one of the key confounders from the analytic framewor k. Of the studies that identified at least one significant association, many did not adjust for baseline anthropometric values and either adjusted for birth weight or reported anthropometric outcomes at multiple time points. The majority of articles (~80%) adjusted for feeding practices aside from complementary feeding but how feeding practices were accounted for varied across studies. For example, studies may have enrolled either BF or FF infants, enrolled both but analyzed BF and FF infants separately, ad justed for duration of BF or FF in analyses, or did not adjust analyses but reported no differences between groups at baseline. There was minor inconsistency across studies in the description of human milk, infant formula, and/or types and amounts of CFB c onsumed. The majority of studies commonly defined CFB as solids other than human milk or infant formula, but several studies also reported the age of introduction of specific types of CFB (9, 11, 15, 18, 19, 44, 60, 61, 76) , which are discussed in more detail in a separate SR (83). Another limitation is the limited reliability/validity of assessment methods for both timing of CFB introduction and outcome assessment. Several studies used reported, not measured, weight/height from vario us sources (11, 28, 39, 47, 61, 71) . Several studies did not describe their methods to assess outcomes (1, 33) or used unstandardized methods (44). Although the majority of observational studies reported using \"standard procedures\" for anthropometric measurements, many of the studies either lacked sufficient description of outcome assessment or indicated that measures were only colle cted once as opposed to in duplicate or triplicate (6, 8, 13, 22, 26, 31 - 34, 36 -38, 40, 42 -44, 46, 48, 50, 53, 55, 59, 64 -67, 70, 76, 81) . Another limitation common to the body of evidence was the assessment of timing of CFB introduction. Two studies did not clearly define their methods for analyzing timing of CFB introduction (27, 57) . Multiple studies had distinct or unique age s at which they examined timing of CFB introduction (for examples see 25, 54, 69, 79), which does not allow for interpretation based on time points outside of those distinct or unique ages. Finally, many of the included articles examined CFB introduction < 4 mo of age as the earliest category of introduction, with fewer relative comparison groups between 4 -6 43 mo of age and/or >6 mo of age. Finally, internal validity was a concern in several studies. In both of the RCTs, blinding of investigators could not be determined and participants were not blinded as they either received CFB or remained exclusively BF/FF. In the majority of the observational studies, blinding of outcome assessors could not be determined. Adequacy of statistical methods in several studies was insufficient due to either a lack of detail describing data or inconsistency of data reported (5, 16, 47, 54, 66) or difficulty in interpretation based on time points reported (69). 44 Research recommendations Future research should account for the substantial individual variability that is likely in terms of the ideal timing of CFB introduction, which may contribute to the relationship between timing of CFB and growth, size, body composition, and/or weight stat us in a given study population. Factors to consider include: o Parent rationale for timing of introduction of CFB (e.g., infant feeding style, infant demand, infant size/growth faltering, attitudes/beliefs, fear of inadequate milk supply, infant sleep promo tion) o Plasticity across time (intrauterine, genetic, and/or environmental effects) o Predominant type of early milk feeding (e.g. exclusive breastfeeding or formula feeding or mixed) In studies examining the association between timing of CFB introduction and child growth, inclusion of multiple growth -related measures substantially aid interpretation of results. Observational studies should be a low priority, in particular those that examine only one outcome and/or categorize by CFB introduction before 4 mo of age, in favor of additional rigorous RCTs that examine multiple outcomes and/or CFB introduction between the ages of 4 mo and 6 mo or later.

When a country was not included in the Human Development Report 2014 ranking, country classification from the World Bank was used instead (84). Medium Development countries were originally included, but due to concerns about generalizability to the U.S. of study participants (i.e., baseline health status) and complementary foods and beverages typically consumed, a deci sion was made to exclude \"Medium\" countries in October 2017 53 Search terms and used PubMed: Date(s) 7/19/2016 NOT OR formula)) AND ( feeding* OR food OR beverage*[tiab] OR beverages[mh] OR eating diet[tiab] OR diet[mh] OR breast feeding*[tiab] OR breast -feeding*[tiab] OR breastfed[tiab] OR breast -fed[tiab] OR breast -feed OR breast -feeds) OR (Bottle feeding[mh] OR bottle feeding*[tiab]s OR bottle feeding OR bottle -feeding*[tiab] OR bottle - feedings OR bottle -fed[tiab] OR movement ASQ[tiab] OR cognition[mh] OR body weight \"body \"weight weight OR \"Body Weights and Measures\"[mh] OR weight[ti] OR \"Anthropometry\"[Mesh:noexp] body OR body weight[mh] OR waist -hip ratio[mh] Hip*[tiab] OR OR Length*[ tiab] OR head circumference*[tiab] OR arm circumference*[tiab] OR thigh circumference* OR limb circumference* OR fat free mass*[tiab] OR skinfold[tiab] OR skin fold*[tiab]) AND infant* OR baby OR babies OR toddler* OR newborn*[tiab] OR \"Child, Preschool \"[Mesh] years\"[tiab] pre - OR OR five*[ti] OR young child*[ti] OR \"head start\"[tiab] OR prekindergarten[tiab] OR pre -kindergarten[tiab] OR we anling* OR limit to child, preschool for child 0 -18 all develop outcomes for all; body wgt/comp/bone NOT nutritional status[mh] OR nutritional status*[tiab] OR Nutrition Status*[tiab] OR Iron[mh] OR iron[tiab] Acids, Omega -3\"[Mesh] OR \"Fatty Acids, Omega OR family) NEAR/3 (feed* OR food* OR beverage* OR eating OR diet) OR (Complementary OR transition* OR introduct* OR wean*) 'whole grains' OR dairy OR egg OR eggs OR meat OR poultry OR seafood OR fruit* OR milk OR fish* OR poultry OR beverage* OR vegetables* OR pea OR peas OR nut OR nuts OR cereal OR bread* OR yog*urt* OR chee se* OR juice* OR rice soup snack* OR (for food*):ab,ti (infant*:ti,ab infant/exp) (baby OR babies OR OR 'body growth'/exp 'body growth':ti,ab OR 'whole grains' OR dairy OR egg OR meat OR poultry OR seafood OR fruit* OR milk OR fish* OR poultry OR vegetables* OR pea OR beans OR legume* OR nut OR cereal OR beverage* OR bread* OR seafood OR yog*urt* OR cheese OR juice OR snack OR yogurt OR yoghurt OR nut OR nuts OR honey OR mea l OR meals) NEAR/3 (Complementary OR supplementa* OR wean* OR transition* OR introduct* family) Physiological Phenomena\"] OR [mh OR OR (MH (MH \"Diet\") OR (MH \"Eating\") OR (MH \"Eating Behavior\") OR (MH \"Taste\") OR Buds\") \"Cereals\") OR (MH \"Dairy Products\") OR (MH \"Yogurt\") OR (MH \"Cheese\") OR (MH \"Milk\") OR (MH \"Eggs\") OR (MH \"Fruit\") OR (MH \"Fruit Juices\") OR (MH \"Meat\") OR (MH \"Seafood\") OR (MH \"Fish\") OR (MH \"Poultry\") OR (MH \"Vegetables\") OR (MH \"Nuts\") OR (MH \"Legumes\") OR (MH \"Bread\") AND (Complementary OR OR OR ('whole grain' OR 'whole grains' OR dairy OR egg OR eggs OR meat OR poultry OR seafood OR fruit* OR milk OR fish* OR poultry OR vegetables* OR pea OR peas OR nut OR nuts OR cereal OR beverage* OR bread* OR seafood OR yog*urt* OR cheese* OR supplementa* OR transition* OR introduc* OR family) OR (Infant* OR baby OR N2 food* NOT Deficiency\") \"Anemia\") OR Iron Deficiency\") OR (MH \"Iron\") OR (MH (MH \"Folic Aci Deficiency\") OR \"folate\" OR \"folacin\" (MH Acids, Omega OR (MH \"Fatty Acids, Omega -3\") (MH (MH OR \"Linolenic (disease* OR fracture* injur* OR health* OR mineralize* OR OR ricket* OR \"Osteoporosis\") OR (MH Diseases+\") OR OR (MH \"Rickets+\") OR (MH \"Executive Function\") OR (M H \"Learning+\") OR (MH \"Intelligence+\") OR OR (MH (MH \"Memory+\") \"memory\" (MH \"Anxiety+\") OR (MH OR al (MH \"Anthropometry+\") (MH \"Body Weights Measures+\") OR (MH \"Body Weight+\") OR \"Fat (MH \"Growth Inequality\") OR (MH \"Mean Length of Utterance\") 60 Figure 2: Flow chart of literature search and screening results This flow chart illustrates the literature search results for articles examining the relationship between complementary feeding and growth, size, and/or body composition. The results of an electr onic database search were s creened independently by two NESR analysts by reviewing titles, abstracts, and full text articles to determine which articles met the criteria for inclusion. A manual search was done to ascertain articles not identified through t he electronic database search. The systematic review on timing of introduction of CFB included 81 articles, and the systematic review on types and amounts of CFB consumed included 49 articles. The literature search was conducted for multiple systematic rev iews that addressed complementary feedi ng and various health outcomes. 61 Excluded articles The table below lists the excluded articles with at least one reason for exclusion, but may not reflect all possible reasons.
