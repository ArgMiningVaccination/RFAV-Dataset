A detoxification or cleansing program is one way to help determine if this is the case. Detoxification and cleansing are used to stimulate and support all the body's means of processing and eliminating hormones, chemicals and other substances that we are exposed to daily, aiding the body in getting rid of unwanted substances. Because we are continually being exposed to toxins in our food, water, air and environment, our organs of elimination become overburdened and our cells become storage bins for these toxins. The following are some health conditions that can be aided by supporting the body's ability to detoxify: - Allergies - Chemical sensitivity - Digestive problems such as irritable bowl syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease - Chronic fatigue - Hormonal issues: PMS and menopausal symptoms - Skin conditions: acne, eczema and psoriasis - Chronic headaches A detox cleansing program is beneficial for almost anyone wanting to improve their health. In a nutshell, detoxification means cleansing. This is done by removing impurities from the blood in the liver, where toxins are processed for elimination. The other organs of elimination-kidneys, lungs, bowels and skin-can get sluggish over time and this can lead to disease in the body. If you think about it, your elimination organs are working 24/7 without rest. They occasionally need some respite, much in the same way we need to sleep to recharge and energize our bodies on a daily basis. This is where detoxification can play a vital role in how well they do their individual jobs and collectively contribute to overall health and supporting your immune system. At the Flagstaff Clinic of Naturopathic Medicine, we are all about empowering you with tools to have amazing health at any age. Every spring and fall, we office a doctor-guided cleanse, and April is our cleanse month!
