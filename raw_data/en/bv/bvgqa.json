Clinicians should be able to identify and diagnose patients with a clinical presentation of bronchiolitis, limiting the use of extensivediagnostic testing. 2. Although bronchiolitis is a condition commonly encountered in pediatrics, there is no single effective therapeutic agent; therefore, withan aim to provide high-value and high-quality care, clinicians should beaware that the main treatment plan for bronchiolitis is supportive care. Objectives After completing this article, readers should be able to: 1. Evaluate and diagnose patients with bronchiolitis. 2. Summarize the 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the management and prevention of bronchiolitis. 3. Identify potential current therapies as well as interventions not recommended for routine use in bronchiolitis. 4. Discuss prevention measures for bronchiolitis.5. Describe the prognosis for patients diagnosed as having bronchiolitis. INTRODUCTION Acute bronchiolitis refers to airway in flammation and obstruction of the lower respiratory tract and is caused almost exclusively by viral infection inchildren younger than 2 years. Commonly, symptoms of bronchiolitis begin with rhinitis or congestion and cough and may develop into symptoms of increasing respiratory distress (tach ypnea, wheezing, and accessory muscle use). (1) Severity of bronchiolitis can vary from mild symptoms that can be managed at home to acute respiratory failure requiring invasive ventilation. There is wide variation in care for infants admitted to the hospital with bronchiolitis, which persists despite the existence of guidelines. (2)(3)(4) In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published the \"Clinical Practice Guideline: The Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Bronchi-olitis \"(1) (summarized in Table 1), an updated, revised version of a previous 2006 AAP guideline. (5) The strength of these recommendations are explained in Table 2. (1) Pediatricians should be familiar with these guidelines as well as evidence behind available diagnostic and treatment modalities.

(3)(6) EPIDEMIOLOGY As the leading reason for hospitalization in the rst year of life, bronchiolitis is responsible for approximately 100,000 hospital admissions annually in the United States. Although the number of admissions declined from 2000 to 2009, thenumber of emergency department visits, disease severity, use of noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, and hospital charges all increased during this time. Nationwide, hospital charges for patients with bronchiolitis exceeded $1.7 billion in 2009. (7) Use of molecular detection techniques has made it possible to identify a variety of causative viral agents for bronchiolitis. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is by far the most commonly identi ed virus, detected in up to 80% of patients, followed by human rhinovirus. Clinical features of bronchiolitis caused by individual viruses are generally similar, although each virus demonstrates slight variation in seasonality and geographic distribution, and there are some data to suggest that RSV may be associated with a more severe illness course. (8) Some studies also point to greater disease severity in infants with co- infection by 2 or more viruses, although data are con flicting. (9) In the United States, RSV bronchiolitis accounts for fewer than100 deaths annually, although mortality due to bronchiolitis is signicantly higher in resource-limited countries. (9) The epidemiology of RSV differs globally based on mete- orologic conditions. In temperate climates, illness from RSV occurs in epidemics based on colder temperatures. In the Northern Hemisphere, infection rates increase from late October through April and peak in January or February. (8) This is followed by wintertime epidemics in the South- ern Hemisphere from May to September. (10) During thesepeak times, viral transmission and disease severity are thought to be facilitated by indoor crowding, the impair- ment of ciliary function by cold air, and the temperature dependence of innate antiviral immune responses. (8) Alter- natively, in tropical or semitropical climates, RSV outbreaks tend to be more common during the rainy season. (10) PATHOGENESIS The pathogenesis of bronchiol itis involves a combination of airway edema, increased mucus production, and necrosis of airway epithelial cells due to direct cytotoxic injury. (8) RSV transmission occurs from person to person either by direct inoculation of nasal mucosa with contaminated secretions or by inhalation of large infectious droplets. Virus replicates in the nasal epithelium, and an exaggerated immune responseoccurs, with an in flux of natural killer cells, lymphocytes, and granulocytes into the epithelium. After an incubation period of 4 to 6 days from transmission, upper respiratory tract symp- toms appear, including nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. (9) In approximately one-third of infected patients, infection then spreads to the lower respiratory tract by sloughing and TABLE 1.

(9) Viral replication subsequently occurs in the mucosal epi-thelial cells of the bronchioles. Similar to the upper respi- ratory tract, the resultant immune response in the lower tract leads to edema, further sloughing of epithelial cells, and mucus secretion. This leads to airway narrowing and obstruction, further worsened by impaired ciliary function. Cough, wheezing, tachypnea, nasal flaring, and retractions are the clinical manifestations of the airway obstruction. Distal air trapping causes hyperin flation and localized atel- ectasis. Mismatching of ventilation and perfusion leads to further increased work of breathing and hypoxemia. Fever is not universal, occurring in approximately 50% of patients.An uncomplicated illness may last 1 to 3 weeks before all symptoms are completely resolved, although viral shedding may last up to 4 weeks, especially in very young or immu- nocompromised patients. Unfortunately, despite the robust immune response, RSV infections occur throughout life, even in the absence of detectable antigenic change. (9) RISK FACTORS For most previously well infants, bronchiolitis is generally aself-limited disease. However, a subset of patients may be at risk for more severe disease, with several host and environ- mental factors contributing to severity risk. Age is the most important predictor of disease severity, with greatest risk between 1 and 3 months, when protective maternal anti- bodies wane. (9) Similarly, preterm infants, especially thoseless than 29 weeks of gestation who miss the window of greatest transplacental transfer of antibodies, are at higher risk for severe disease. Other severity risk factors includechronic lung disease of prematurity and hemodynamically signicant congenital heart disease, especially in patients with pulmonary hypertension or congestive heart failure. Trisomy 21, lower weight, and neuromuscular disorders have also been described as independent predictors of severe bronchiolitis. (11) Sex may also play a role, with boys seeming to be at higher risk for severe illness than girls. There does not seem to be a disparity in rate of hospital- ization between African American and white infants; data for other racial and ethnic groups are limited. (9) Several recent studies have focused on preventable envi- ronmental risk factors for severe bronchiolitis. Although the mechanism is not completely understood, cigarette smokehas been shown to affect the incidence and severity of bronchiolitis. Infants with in utero tobacco smoke exposure were more likely to be admitted to the ICU for bronchiolitis in one study, (12) and in another, postnatal tobacco smoke exposure was associated with signi cantly increased odds of developing severe disease. (13) Other research suggests that air pollution, even at levels widely accepted as \"safe, \"may increase bronchiolitis risk. (14) CLINICAL ASPECTS The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is made primarily based onhistory and physical examination ndings. AAP guidelines recommend against the routine use of laboratory or radio- graphic testing. Patients often present with a history of a few days of initial upper respiratory symptoms (rhinorrhea,congestion) and fever, progressing into lower respiratory tract symptoms. Prominent lower respiratory tract symp- toms include cough, wheezing, tachypnea, and signs of TABLE 2. Guideline De nitions for Evidence-Based Statements STATEMENT DEFINITION IMPLICATION Strong recommendation A particular action is favored because anticipated bene ts clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable.Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for analternative approach is present. Moderate recommendation A particular action is favored because anticipated bene ts clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent(or is unobtainable).Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patientpreferences. Weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence)A particular action is favored because anticipated bene ts clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak.Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences. Weak recommendation (based on balance of bene ts and harms)Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of bothbene t and harm that seem similar in magnitude for any available courses of action.Clinicians should consider the options in their decision making, but patient preference mayhave a substantial role.

Risk of apnea in young infants varies in s t u d i e sf r o ml e s st h a n1 %t o2 4 % .( 9 ) ( 1 5 )I n f a n t sc a n present with dif culty feeding and dehydration due to upper respiratory tract obs truction from mucus produc- tion and airway edema. Physical examination ndings vary from mild, with tachypnea, to severe, with complete respiratory failure. Vital sign changes include tachypnea, hypoxemia, and tachycar- dia (due to dehydration or as a re flection of hypoxemia). (16) Other physical ndings include varying measures of increased work of breathing, including varying degrees of retractions, head bobbing, nasal flaring, and grunting. Signs of dehydration may also be seen on examination, including delayed capillary re ll, sunken fontanelle, dry mucous membranes, and poor skin turgor. Findings on auscultation can include diffuse wheezing, crackles, coarse prolonged expiratory phase, and transmitted upper airway sounds. The course of illness can be varied and dynamic, chang- ing from moment to moment. The typical course of illness peaks at approximately day 3 to 4 of illness (16); however, this can have signi cant variation. Similarly, in assessing patients with bronchiolitis, physical examination ndings may vary from moment to moment so that often-repeated observations are helpful to truly assess clinical severity. The nature of inherent variability in children with bronchiolitis has made it dif cult for a single clinical severity scoring system to be widely accepted in predicting severity or clinical disposition. (17) The AAP clinical practice guideline speci cally recom- mends against the routine use of chest radiography for the evaluation of bronchiolitis. (1) Most patients with bronchi- olitis have chest radiographs with hyperin flation, possibly with atelectasis or in ltrates, which often do not correlate with disease severity or aid with management. (18) Abnor- malndings may lead to increased use of antibiotics without true underlying bacterial pneumonia, increasing both potential harms to the patie nt and health-care costs. (19)(20) Similarly, the AAP clinical practice guideline rec-ommends against routine viral testing given that identi - cation of a given virus does not alter management. (1) The only circumstance for which it could be considered is in the setting of suspected potential in fluenza infection if the clinical presentation as well as current community epide- miologic factors support the possibility of in fluenza infec- tion, and, therefore, in fluenza antiviral agents could be considered. (16)MANAGEMENT The management of bronchiolitis is largely supportive; despite numerous trials of various medical therapeutic interventions, no clear single therapy has been found tobe signi cantly bene cial. The mainstay of therapy begins with an assessment of need for supportive care by assessinghydration status and oxygenation. Dehydration can occurdue to increased insensible losses with tachypnea, fever, andincreased secretions or due to decreased oral intake in thesetting of decreased energy, increased work of breathing, orcongestion impeding oral intake. Support for dehydrationcan be provided in the form of encouraging frequent smallaliquots of oral, nasogastric, or intravenous hydration, with-out a single modality being superior to the others. Severebronchiolitis may be associated with greater potential forhyponatremia, (21) and management with hypotonic fluids may also be associated with less favorable outcomes. (22) Hypoxemia may also accompany bronchiolitis, and it may be intermittent or variable due to the intermittent nature of plugging of bronchioles by mucus resulting inventilation-perfusion mismatch. Whereas in the past therehas been debate about acceptable levels of oxygen saturation,the most recent AAP clinical practice guideline suggests thatclinicians may choose to not give supplemental oxygentherapy if saturations are greater than 90%. (1) Similarly,for children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, clinicians maychoose not to use continuous pulse oximetry for those whodo not require supplemental oxygen. Both of these recom-mendations have been shown to be safe compared withprevious oxygen targets and pulse oximetry measurementpractices. (23)(24) The use of continuous pulse oximetry isnot only potentially associated with increased LOS but alsooccasionally feeds into the plight of overdiagnosis due tofrequent false alarms, which can additionally lead to sub-sequent decreased rest for patients and families. (25)(26) Although a common measure of supportive care, there is currently insuf cient evidence to recommend for or against nasal suctioning as a potential intervention to help withupper airway obstruction due to mucus production. How-ever, there is evidence to recommend against deep suction-ing because it can prolong LOS in infants hospitalized withbronchiolitis. (27) Possible explanations for this nding are that deep suctioning may cause more airway trauma and,therefore, edema and irritation, inadvertently prolongingsymptoms, or, alternatively, that the use of a larger-calibercatheter for nasopharyngeal suctioning may be more effec-tive in clearing nasal secretions and, thus, improve symp-toms sooner. (27) Similarly, chest physiotherapy has beenexamined as a potential supportive measure that overall has 572 Pediatrics in Review Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/40/11/568/1357557/pedsinreview_20180260.pdf by Stony Brook University user on 26 January 2023been shown to be ineffective at improving outcomes such as LOS or disease severity; however, there are some con flicting more recent studies that may suggest bene t, speci cally using passive expiratory techniques, such as providing bimanual thoracic and abdominal pressure during expira- tion and holding the pressure for a few respiratory cycles. (28)(29) There is some potentially con flicting evidence on this topic due to the heterogeneity of studies in the sense that the severity of illness in patients included in these studies varies, as well as the chest physiotherapy techniques vary between studies. (29) However, currently there is not enough bene t shown in any particular group or method to warrant general recommendation. Various studies and systematic reviews (30)(31)(32) have demonstrated that neither albuterol nor any other b-agonist bronchodilators should be used to treat children with bron- chiolitis, concluding that the adverse effects and costs supersede possible bene ts. (1) Similarly, racemic epineph- rine and other areceptor agonists should not be used to treat bronchiolitis. (33) One study 'sndings con flict with this statement; the study showed some potential bene t when combining racemic epinephrine with corticosteroids spe-cically in the emergency department setting. (34) However, this has not been conclusively determined. Similarly, corti- costeroids have been shown to be ineffective in the routine treatment of bronchiolitis. (35) Nebulized hypertonic saline is a treatment option that has received recent attention due to con flicting clinical trial results, the con flict coming from reported widely varying LOSs, particularly in studies conducted outside the United States; but even when solely examining studies conducted in the United States, differences exist. (36)(37)(38) Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews have also come todifferent conclusions. (39)(40)(41)(42) The most recent publication using a more novel method, trial sequence analysis, has concluded that results from previous meta- analyses that show a bene t likely represent a type I error (concluding that a statistically signi cant treatment exists, when one does not exist in reality). Therefore, clear bene t from hypertonic saline cannot be concluded. (43) Heated humidi ed high- flow nasal cannula oxygen is a treatment modality that has more recently gained popularityin use for the treatment of infants with bronchiolitis, although its ef cacy has not been conclusively proved. There are data to suggest that heated humidi ed high- flow nasal cannula oxygen may decrease respiratory effort and work of breathing, as well as some potential evidence of decreasing need for escalation of care; however, again, con flicting data exist. (44)(45)(46) All of these studies, as well as additional studies focusing on potential safety issues, includingfeeding while on high- flow nasal cannula, suggest that heated humidi ed high- flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy is a safe treatment modality. (47) Antibiotic drug therapy is not recommended for the treatment of bronchiolitis unless an identi ed concomitant bacterial infection (such as acute otitis media or urinary tract infection) is con rmed or suspected. Studies vary on the potential risk of serious bacterial infection in infants with bronchiolitis, which also differs by the age of the patient in question. Although bacteremia and meningitis are extremely rare, infections such as urinary tract infection or acute otitis media may be more common. (48)(49) Laboratory testing to conrm concomitant bacterial infection when suspected should be obtained before initiating antibiotic drug use. Antiviral drug therapy is not recommended unless speci - cally in the setting of in fluenza infection, as noted previously herein. (16) Measures to prevent bronchiolitis are important for the pediatric provider to be familiar with to assist in treating patients and educating families and caregivers. (1) Prema- ture infants or infants with comorbidities (such as signi cant heart disease, or neuromuscular disease) should receive prophylaxis with palivizumab as appropriate during the RSV season, as per AAP guidelines, which may vary year to year as to eligibility and speci c recommendations, with the most recent rec- ommendations referenced. (50) In the clinical setting, appropriate isolation precaution measures should be used to minimize spread of infection to other patients or care- givers. When speaking with families and caregivers of young infants and children, clinicians should also empha- size measures that will decrease risk of developing or spreading bronchiolitis, such as appropriate hand hygiene(using alcohol-based hand rubs or, when not available, soap and water) and decreasing exposure of young infants in particular to others who are ill. Other measures that may decrease both the occurrence and severity of bronchiolitis are decreasing tobacco smoke exposure as well as encour- aging breastfeeding. When speci cally discussing emergency department or inpatient management of bronchiolitis, differences in care practices have been shown to correlate with differences inhospital costs and LOS. Overuse of resources that are not supported by the AAP guidelines has been associated with increased LOS without the bene t of decreased readmis- sion. (3) Clinical pathways that reinforce the conservative approach (eg, not using bronchodilators) have been associ- ated with decreased LOS, (51) decreased use of ineffective therapies (such as bronchodilators or corticosteroids), and decreased LOS without affecting readmissions. (52) Vol. 40 No. 11 NOVEMBER 2019 573 Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/40/11/568/1357557/pedsinreview_20180260.pdf by Stony Brook University user on 26 January 2023The existence of the AAP clinical practice guideline has allowed for signi cant opportunity to implement various quality improvement initiatives, such as using clinical path- ways at an institution level, and to implement initiatives that have resulted from national collaboratives. (53)(54)(55)(56) Potential initiatives could target various outcomes (such as LOS) or reduce evaluation or treatment measures that are not routinely recommended (such as chest radiography or bronchodilators, respectively). PROGNOSIS By nature, bronchiolitis is a self-limited disease with arelatively good prognosis. Mortality risk is relatively low and declining in otherwise healthy children, including those younger than 1 year, with recent analysis revealing an odds ratio of 0.25 in the United States when examining in- hospital mortality out of all patients hospitalized with bron- chiolitis, comparing 2009 and 2000 mortality data, which approximates fewer than 100 deaths annually. (7)(9) Themost common sequela attributed to bronchiolitis is the development of reactive airway disease or asthma later in childhood. Although the reported risk varies from 20% to 60%, infants with severe bronchiolitis, such as those requir- ing hospitalization (particularly infants <6 months of age), have a higher risk of developing asthma later in life. (57)(58) Asthma may occur with increased frequency in infants with a personal or family history of atopy. Therefore, counseling to all families after the initial episode of bronchiolitis shouldinclude advice to be attentive to the potential for wheezing or increased respiratory distress if the child develops another viral respiratory illness in the future.

A previously healthy 2-month-old boy presents to the clinic with a 12-hour history of \"breathing fast, \"rhinorrhea, congestion, and cough. He has been breastfeeding normally until this morning, when he was noted to stop latching on due to congestion and cough.The baby was born at 38 weeks 'gestation but was small for gestational age due to placental insuf ciency. The mother had an uneventful pregnancy. She smoked in the rst trimester but stopped smoking when she learned she was pregnant. Family history issigni cant for asthma. The baby is diagnosed as having bronchiolitis. You explain to the family that because it is early in the course of the disease, the clinical course could potentially worsen. Which of the following is the most important predictor of diseaseseverity in this patient? A. Age. B. Being born small for gestational age. C. Breastfeeding. D. Family history of asthma. E. Male sex. 2. Physical examination of the patient in the vignette in question 1 shows a temperature of 100.4\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C), respiratory rate of 50 breaths/min, heart rate of 140 beats/min, andoxygen saturation of 95% on room air. On physical examination the baby is alert and awakebut in mild respiratory distress with subcostal retractions. There is no head bobbing but there is nasal flaring and nasal congestion. On lung auscultation, mild end expiratory wheezing is diffusely heard. He has moist mucous membranes, and his cardiacexamination ndings are normal. The rest of the examination ndings are normal. In evaluating the respiratory illness in this patient, which of the following is the most useful method in making the diagnosis of bronchiolitis? A. Acute and convalescent serum specimens. B. Chest radiography. C. Complete blood cell count. D. History and physical examination. E. Nasopharyngeal swab for viral culture. 3. A 4-month-old infant presents to the emergency department (ED) in respiratory distress in January. She was born at 36 weeks 'gestation without complications. She does attend child care, where there are multiple other children with \"colds. \"Her mother reports that the baby has had 2 days of increasing dif culty breathing, with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and low-grade fever. This morning the mother noted signi cant work of breathing, with nasal flaring and retractions, and brought the baby to the ED. On physical examination the baby has a temperature of 99.7\u00b0F (37.6\u00b0C), respiratory rate of 65 breaths/min, heart rate of180 beats/min, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air.
