Sometimes called pressure acupuncture, acupressure is often thought of as simply acupuncture without the needles. Botanical medicines are effective and safe when used properly, in the right dose and in the proper combinations with other herbs or treatments.

Colon hydrotherapy is referred to as colon irrigation, colonics, colon therapy or high enemas. Regardless of the name, they all refer to the use of water for internal cleansing of the colon (large intestines), without the use of drugs or chemicals. Craniosacral therapy is a technique that releases tightened, constricted tissue. It is among the gentlest of the bodywork therapies. It is unlike chiropractic manipulation in that there is no jolting of the body. Craniosacral therapy also holds an adjustment longer than chiropractic manipulation. Many clients get the results they need in three sessions. Others have the treatment done weekly for several months. Dr. Gail Ravello is a primary care doctor who strictly uses natural medicine in her practice. She treats the whole family using nutrition, vitamins and supplements, homeopathy, botanical medicine and natural hormone therapy. Naturopathic medicine is safe for infants and during pregnancy. Please see commonly treated conditions. This powerful system of medicine is more than 200 years old and is widely accepted in other countries (The Royal Family of England uses a homeopathic physician). Homeopathic medicines act to strengthen the body's innate immune response; they seldom have side effects. Some conditions that conventional medicine has no effective treatment for respond well to homeopathy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves exposing the body to 100 percent oxygen at a pressure that is greater than what you normally experience. Wounds need oxygen to heal properly, and exposing a wound to 100 percent oxygen can, in many cases, speed the healing process. We work with your oncologist to help treat side effects of chemotherapy.
