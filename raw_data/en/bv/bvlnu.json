The document consists of two main parts: (1) presentation of background information on the programme activities and methodology and an analysis of the available information at the regional level; and (2) presentation of data on NWFP at the national level (so-called \"country profiles\"). Most of the data presented in this report are indicative figures, which have been collected in published and unpublished reports, and therefore do not represent official statistics. The results presented show that qualitative and quantitative information on NWFP at the national level continues to be weak. It is hoped that this report will support the ongoing process of data improvement on NWFP. Improved data are considered to be essential to ensure that the use and importance of NWFP are taken adequately into consideration by decision-makers, land-use planners, politicians or other concerned experts. Additional information and comments from readers to improve data on NWFP in Asian countries would be appreciated very much. Information and comments can be sent to: Non-Wood Forest Products Programme Forest Products Division, Forestry Department, FAO Viale delle Man Amatya and An Van Bay (Viet Nam). Various colleagues at FAO headquarters and at the FAO Regional Office in Bangkok have been involved in the compilation, editing and finalization of the NWFP country profiles. Thomas Enters, Ma Qiang, Johan Lejeune, and Sven Walter, contributed to the collection, analysis and editing of the information presented. Their efforts are appreciated. Furthermore, we would like to thank the European Commission for the financial support given for this work through the Tropical Forestry Budget Line B7-6201/97. It is hoped that readers will find this publication useful and that it will contribute to improving data collection on NWFP in Asia. 4BACKGROUND Scope of the study In most tropical countries, non-wood forest products (NWFP)1 play an important role in the daily lives and well being of the local population. In particular rural and poor people depend on NWFP inter alia as sources of food, fodder, medicines, gums, resins and construction material. In addition to local consumption, NWFP are also important traded commodities on local, regional, national as well as international markets. Traded NWFP contribute to the fulfilment of daily needs and provide employment as well as income. Internationally traded NWFP, such as aromatic oils and medicinal plants, can achieve high prices in comparison with NWFP traded on national markets and thus contribute to the economic development of the respective country. However, very limited statistical data are available on the exploitation, management, consumption and trade of NWFP. Unlike timber and agricultural products, no regular monitoring and evaluation of the resources and socio-economic contribution of NWFP at the national level are being carried out. In the FAO yearbook of forest products , for example, statistical data on NWFP such as cork, tannins, bamboo and various oils are only available from 1954 to 1971 (Chandrasekheran 1995) Consequently information is limited today to selected NWFP of national importance. But even for several of these major NWFP, data are often incomplete and cannot be extrapolated to the national level or compared among countries. FAO assists national governments and institutions to improve the availability of national qualitative and quantitative data related to NWFP. This activity is carried out within the framework of the EC-FAO Partnership Programme \"Information and Analysis for Sustainable Forest Management: Linking National and International Efforts in South Asia and South East Asia\" (Project GCP/RAS/173/EC), a four-year programme funded by the European Commission (Directorate-General Development). The overall aim of this programme is to strengthen national capacity to collect and compile reliable information on forestry and analyse the forest sector. This report contains the NWFP country profiles compiled for 15 Asian countries at the national level. These country profiles include a standardized text providing the available qualitative and quantitative data on NWFP and a standardized table showing quantitative information. Furthermore, the report includes an analysis of regional data. Methodology Under the EC-FAO Partnership Programme, the available information on NWFP was reviewed and compiled at the national level, in each country, to assess the socio-economic significance and ecological impact of its utilization. Existing data gaps and constraints related to data collection were identified for each country to elaborate practical proposals for improved monitoring of NWFP. In particular, desk studies were carried out to compile draft \"country profiles\" on NWFP, including information available at FAO headquarters. A standard format for the presentation of information was elaborated showing key information requirements for the evaluation of NWFP. During a regional workshop for data validation, held in January 2002, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the draft country profiles were discussed with country representatives to validate available information and add missing data. 1 NWFP consist of goods of biological origin other than wood, derived from forests, other wooded lands and trees outside forests. 5Kind of information collected To evaluate the socio-economic importance and ecological impact of NWFP exploitation, key information on the products, resources and their economic value has been collected. (a) Product information A standard classification of NWFP does not exist yet. NWFP can be classified in many different ways according to their end use (medicine, drinks, utensils, etc.) or the plant-parts used (roots, leaves, bark, etc.). For further information see Chandrasekehran (1995), Cook (1995), FAO (1992) and Shiva and Mathur (1996) Chandrasekharan (1995) developed a classification of NWFP in accordance with the major international classification systems, such as the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System, the Standard International Trade Classification Rev. 3 and the Provisional Central Product Classifications. To simplify the classification, NWFP were categorized according to their end use, as described in Table 1. Table 1. Main categories of NWFP Plant products Animals and animal products Categories Description Categories Description Food Vegetal foodstuff and beverages provided by fruits, nuts, seeds, roots, mushrooms, etc. Living animals Mainly vertebrates such as mammals, birds, reptiles kept/bought as pets Fodder Animal and bee fodder provided by leaves, fruits, etc. Honey and beeswax Products provided by bees Medicines Medicinal plants (e.g. leaves, bark, roots) used in traditional medicine or by pharmaceutical companies Bushmeat Meat provided by vertebrates, mainly mammals Perfumes and cosmetics Aromatic plants providing essential (volatile) oils and other products used for cosmetic purposes Other edible animal products Mainly edible invertebrates such as insects (e.g. caterpillars) and other \"secondary\" products of animals (e.g. eggs, nests) Dyeing and tanning Plant material (mainly bark and leaves) providing tannins and other plant parts (especially leaves and fruits) used as dyes Hides and skins Hides and skins of animals used for various purposes Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials Heterogeneous group of products including thatch, bamboo, rattan, wrapping leaves, fibres Medicine Entire animals or parts of animals such as various organs used for medicinal purposes Ornamentals Entire plants (e.g. orchids) and parts of the plants (e.g. pots made from roots) used for ornamental purposes Dyes Entire animals or parts of animals such as various organs used as dyes Exudates Substances such as gums (wate r soluble), resins (water insoluble) and latex (milky or clear juice), released from plants by exudation Other non-edible animal products For example, bones that are used as tools Others For example, insecticides, fungicides Monitoring of the resources and evaluation of the economic value of all NWFP in a given country is neither feasible nor desirable. Therefore, only NWFP of national relevance for which 6monitoring and evaluation are needed strongly were identified. Exported or widely used products in national markets should be well identified as opposed to NWFP of minor importance, or limited significance. Selecting relevant NWFP initially should help the country to focus its efforts on improving data collection on major NWFP. A further step would be to include other NWFP. (b) Resource information Evaluation and monitoring of the resources providing NWFP are important to estimate the actual and potential socio-economic and ecological value of these products at the national level. The first step in this process is the identification of the plant or animal species. In some cases, this identification can be difficult because the same commercial product can be extracted from more than one species and, vice versa, several different NWFP can be taken from a single species. For example, the neem tree ( Azadirachta indica ) provides several products, such as edible leaves, seeds, fodder, bark and fuel. On the other hand, bamboo or rattan canes can be obtained from many different species. Another important element worth knowing is which part of the plant is harvested (e.g. roots, bark, exudates). In fact, the harvesting of different plant parts has a different impact on the sustainability of the species considered. Knowledge of the habitat (or production system) and the source (management system) of the exploited species are also important factors. Harvesting of NWFP might cause degradation of the habitat if the exploitation is carried out in an unsustainable way (e.g. utilization of fire for bee hunting). On the other hand, habitat degradation (e.g. through shifting cultivation) might also have a negative influence on the availability of NWFP (e.g. forest fires reduce honey harvests). Furthermore, resource information on whether the species used is cultivated or gathered from wild sources is important. The exploitation of wild species versus cultivated species (generally integrated in a man-made management system) has direct implications on choices at the management level and can have far reaching ecological and socio-economic effects. For example, once most valued NWFP have become popular and commercialized on markets, usually they are transferred into a more intensive cultivation system (see Homa 1994), largely depriving the forest dweller from their socio-economic benefits that could be generated otherwise. In some cases, classifying a species according to a specific habitat or management system can prove to be difficult, since some products may be produced simultaneously by gathering and through cultivation (e.g. bamboo). (c) Socio-economic information To evaluate the socio-economic importance of NWFP, quantitative data on resources, product consumption and trade are required. Figures should indicate quantity (tonnes, m\u00b3, etc.), product status (dried, graded, semi-processed, etc.) and value (US$) for a given period (year). It is important to know if the product is used mainly for subsistence or commerce. Therefore, it is better to distinguish between utilization at the national level (including subsistence and trade on a local, regional or national market) and the international level. Besides this quantifiable information, qualitative information is important regarding the cultural and socio-economic context of the NWFP utilization (for example, access to the resources, the main social categories of the harvesters, etc.). Lessons learned In the framework of the EC-FAO Partnership Programme, efforts have been undertaken, for the first time, to collect and collate qualitative and quantitative data on the socio-economic importance and ecological impact of the use of NWFP at the national and regional levels. Due to the scarcity and unreliability of available information, most of the presented data must still be 7regarded as \"tentative\" and \"preliminary\", and only as a reflection of the \"tip of the iceberg\" of the large and heterogeneous group of NWFP. The following key problems related to the collection and analysis of statistical data on NWFP have been identified during the implementation of the programme: Insufficient collaboration and networking: Institutions involved in NWFP statistical collection and analysis do not collaborate sufficiently. Therefore, data remain fragmented and sometimes duplicated. Lack of lead institutions for NWFP statistics: In most countries, various institutions are involved in data collection and analysis. An official national focal point on NWFP statistics does not exist. Weak capacities: Most institutions involved in data collection have limited human and financial resources. Poor stakeholder involvement: Statistical data are gathered mainly by national organizations. Industry and local communities are not involved in data collection and analysis, although they may possess relevant information. Inadequate research: Little research has been carried out to improve the availability of NWFP statistics. Incomplete data: Statistical data only cover a limited number of NWFP and their aspects (e.g. on trade, self-consumption, exploitation). In particular, information on resources and on products used for subsistence purposes is lacking. Furthermore, existing information is often based on case studies, which cannot be extrapolated at the national level. Poor quality of data: Available information is often unclear, inconsistent and contradictory, for example regarding the state of the described product (raw material, processed, semi-processed, graded, etc.), production figures (different units used) and export values. Weak data storage/process facilities: Most of the statistical data on NWFP has yet to be stored and analysed in specific electronic databases. Inadequate methodologies: Appropriate methodologies to collect and analyse viable key information on NWFP are still under development. Taking into consideration the limitations of the availability of NWFP statistical data in Asia, this first version of country profiles and regional synthesis is considered to be the starting point of the process during which additional and more complete information on the socio-economic importance and the ecological implications of NWFP in Asia will be added. 8REGIONAL SYNTHESIS The forest resources in the region The region, as defined for this study, includes 15 countries, namely Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Nepal, Malaysia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. These countries vary widely in size, population and economy. The areas of the countries range from 47 000 km 2 (Bhutan) to 9 327 420 km2 (China). In 1999, the region supported a population of 2 954 300 000 (FAO 2001). Forest cover and its annual rate of change also vary widely. The region is a reservoir of great biodiversity in and outside forests. Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar and Papua New Guinea have a forest cover of between approximately 50 and 60 percent. The total annual reduction of forest cover is greatest in Nepal and Sri Lanka. The only countries with a positive forest cover change are China and Viet Nam. Plantation forestry is important in many countries of the region. Table 2.

Asia is by far the world's largest producer and consumer of NWFP, not only because of its population size but also and to a greater extent because of the traditional use of a vast variety of products for food, shelter and cultural needs. NWFP have been vital to forest-dwellers and rural communities for centuries. Local people collect, process and market bamboo, rattan, resins, fruits, honey, mushrooms, gums, nuts, tubers, edible leaves, bushmeat, lac, oil seeds, essential oils, 9medicinal herbs and tanning materials. Both rural and increasingly urban communities (both affluent and poor, but for different products) draw upon forests for a variety of needs. Asia is unique in that most countries in the region have included data on production and trade of major NWFP in their national statistics for many decades and have developed their own nationally applicable definitions, terminology and classifications for their \"minor forest produce\"2. The types and the relative importance of the listed products change from country to country, but the most important products at the regional level are rattan, bamboo, medicinal and aromatic plants, spices, herbs, resins, mushrooms, forest fruits - nuts and vegetables, leaves and fodder. In addition, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia include assessments of NWFP resources in their national forest inventories. These NWFP resources include rattan, bamboo, resin and essential oil-providing species sandalwood ( Santalum spp.) and agarwood ( Aquilaria spp.), as fruticans , Oncosperma spp. and Metroxylon spp. (sago). As for the rest of the world, the bulk of NWFP consumption in Asia is for subsistence needs or for local barter; there is no official data reporting in country statistics. However, compared with other regions, in Asia more NWFP are being entered on official national accounts and in international trade statistics. They contribute significantly to rural income generation and country export earnings, such as (in order of importance for the whole region): rattan and bamboo products, medicinal plants/preparations, essential oils, resins (copal), pine nuts, mushrooms, spices and herbs (mainly cardamom and cinnamon), fodder and animal products like bushmeat, trophies, wild honey and lac. China and India are by far the world's largest producers and consumers of NWFP. China produces and processes more wild products than any other country in the world. There is growing interest worldwide in its natural foodstuffs, traditional medicines and herbs, and in its handicrafts, made mainly from rattan and bamboo. Thus, China dominates world trade in NWFP (estimated at US$11 billion in 1994). It is followed closely by India, and then Indonesia, Viet Nam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. By subregion, medicinal plants are of major importance in continental Asia, particularly for the higher elevation regions of Nepal, Bhutan, northern India and Pakistan, and southwestern China. High-value medicinal include Nardostachys . In the drier regions in continental and South Asia, grazing of livestock in the forests and production of fodder (from fodder tree branches and leaves) are the main NWFP. Traditionally, the rich forests of insular and Southeast Asia have been a major source of many NWFP; in terms of significant production and trade these include bamboo and rattan, medicines and herbs (Ephedra resins (copal). Globally, rattan is the most important NWFP that is traded internationally. At the local level, it is of critical importance as a primary, supplementary or emergency source of income in rural areas. There are approximately 600 species of rattan, of which some 10 percent are used commercially for industrial processing (mainly furniture making). Key genera are Calamus, Daemonorops, Korthalsia and Plectocomia . Indonesia hosts the bulk of the world rattan resources (by both volume and number of species) and is the largest supplier of cane, with an estimated annual production of 570 000 tonnes. However, Asian rattan resources are being depleted through overexploitation and loss of forest habitats. Only Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, and, to a lesser extent, Lao PDR and Papua New Guinea, still have some significant rattan resources left. In the Philippines, the latest 2 In China, for example, all crops obtained from trees on forest lands, including walnuts, apples and grapes are by law under the Ministry of Forestry and included in the country's forest products statistics. 10national forest inventory data of 1988 showed an available growing stock of approximately 4 500 million linear metres (lm) of rattan (all species combined) in the country. However, no follow-up rattan inventory has been made and it is presumed that most of the commercial species have been cut down already. The total area of rattan plantations in the Philippines is estimated to be between 6 000 and 11 000 ha. In the Peninsular Malaysian Permanent Forest Reserves, the 1992 National Forest Inventory estimated a total of 32.7 million rattan plants (irrespective of age), of which the most abundant (about 37 percent) were the Korthalsia spp. Of Calamus spp., C. manan is the most abundant with around 5.9 million clumps. The rattan plantation area is estimated to be around 30 000 ha (depending on the definition of a \"rattan plantation\", which may range from rattan enrichment planting in logged-over forests to full-scale rattan planting under tree crops like rubberwood). In the case of some of the traditional rattan-producing countries, such as China, India, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Viet Nam and Cambodia, the long-term sustainability of their rattan-processing industries has been undermined by the depletion of rattan stocks in natural forests. Although some smallholder rattan gardens exist, presently, investment in industrial-scale rattan plantations is negligible resulting in an insecure future supply. Bamboo is by far the most commonly used NWFP in Asia. There are more than 500 species. Although international trade in bamboo products is still less important than rattan or medicinal plants, it has increased dramatically in the last decade. Unlike rattan, bam boo is moving out of the crafts industry phase and now provides raw material for industrial products (shoots, construction poles, panelling and flooring products, pulp). This has important repercussions for the bamboo resource base. Increasingly, bamboo is becoming a domesticated crop grown by farmers. Harvesting of bamboo in forests is still important in countries like Myanmar, Lao PDR, and in remote mountain forests in northern India, central China and Viet Nam. China has the largest area of bamboo forests with an estimated area of 7 to 17 million ha (depending on how a \"bamboo forest\" is defined - from dispersed bamboo in degraded natural forests to full-scale plantations), mostly of Phyllostachys and Dendrocalamus spp. Annual production of bamboo poles ranges from 6 to 7 million tonnes (one-third of total known world production). The estimated value of world trade in bambooware is approximately US$36.2 million. China (US$20 million in 1992) and Thailand are the main suppliers; Malaysia, Myanmar, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Viet Nam, the Philippines and Bangladesh are minor exporters. Bamboo shoots supply a rapidly expanding and fashionable export market, with China being the major world producer and exporter (1.6 million tonnes of fresh shoots in 1999), followed by Thailand, with minor quantities from Indonesia, Viet Nam and Malaysia. Bamboo shoots are produced on farms. For thousands of years, forest-gathered medicinal plants have been a key component of the traditional health systems of the region, and this is still the case today. Most countries maintain and have legalized a dual system of providing both \"western medicine\" and traditional health care (Aryuveda, Jamu and others). Traditional health-care systems in the region recognize a long list of about 4 000 medicinal plants of commercial importance. Some species have become active ingredients in western medicine, resulting in growing demand and trade. This demand has led to overharvesting of several species to the point that some species have been listed as endangered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It is estimated that three- quarters of the total production is still gathered from wild sources. However, domestication and production of medicinal plants in home gardens is increasing rapidly. Total world trade in medicinal plants in 1992 was about US$171 million. China is the biggest producer as well as exporter of medicinal plants, accounting for 30 percent of world trade (by value) in 1991, followed by the Republic of Korea, the United States, India and Chile. Singapore and Hong Kong are the main re-exporters in Asia. 11The extensive pine forests in the region provide the resources for the collection of pine-related products such as resins, seeds and mushrooms. China and Indonesia dominate world production of oleoresins from all sources (largely Pinus spp.), which ranges between 1.1 and 1.2 million tonnes annually. China has emerged as the world's largest producer of rosin, with an annual production level of nearly 400 000 tonnes. Pine nuts (seeds of Pinus gerardiana , P. pinea , P. korainsis and P. cembra ) are an important product with a growing and high-value market, particularly in developed countries. Seeds of the chilghoza pine ( P. gerardiana ) are produced and exported by India, Afghanistan and Pakistan. China is the world's largest producer and exporter of Pinus korainsis seeds - one of the larger-seeded species - as well as seeds of Pinus cembra, the Siberian equivalent of the edible seeds from the European Pinus pinea . Production levels vary greatly from year to year. Wild edible mushrooms, particularly morels belonging to the genus Morchella , are another product of considerable economic and commercial significance. Morels are prized for culinary uses, particularly as a gourmet food. Morels grow naturally in the temperate forests of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Nepal and Bhutan. Total world production is estimated at 150 tonnes. Pakistan and India are the major producers, each producing and exporting about 50 tonnes of dry morels annually (equivalent to 500 tonnes of fresh morels). Total world trade in morels is approximately US$50 to 60 million. China is also a major producer and exporter of other wild mushroom species. The Chinese black auricular fungus ( Auricularia auricula ) is well known for its quality, and 1 000 tonnes are exported annually, earning US$8 million. The annual production of Tremella fuciformis often reaches 1 000 tonnes, a third of which is exported. The annual harvest of shiitake mushroom ( Lentinus edodes ) is about 120 000 tonnes, accounting for 38 percent of world production. China is the second largest producer in the world with annual exports of over 1 000 tonnes of dried shiitake mushrooms, valued at US$20 million. Asia is also the world's leading producer of several essential oils. Total world trade in raw essential oils exceeds US$1 billion, but the major share comes from cultivated sources. Major wild sources of essential oils in the region include sandalwood ( Santalum spp.), and eucalypt oils. China, Indonesia, Thailand, India and Viet Nam are the major suppliers of these oils. Spices, condiments and culinary herbs are another important group of products (although most now comes from domesticated sources) that constitute a significant component of world trade. Indonesia is the largest world producer of nutmeg and mace and accounts for three-quarters of world production and export. Indonesia produced 15 800 tonnes of nutmeg during 1990. World trade in cinnamon is between 7 500 to 10 000 tonnes annually. Sri Lanka contributes 80 to 90 percent, most of the balance coming from the Seychelles and Madagascar. The world trade in cassia is about 20 000 to 25 000 tonnes annually, of which Indonesia accounts for two-thirds and China most of the remainder. Minor producers include Viet Nam and India. About 2 000 to 3 000 tonnes of cassia bark are exported from Viet Nam annually. The European Union, the United States and Japan are the major markets. Products of lesser importance include sago, illipe nuts, bird nests, karaya gum, kapok and shellac. Sago is starch obtained from the stem of the sago palm ( Metroxylon spp.). Indonesia is the major producer and exporter. During 1991, Indonesia exported 10 108 tonnes of sago flour and meal to Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, valued at US$2.32 million. Malaysia also produces small volumes. Illipe nut is the commercial name for the winged fruits produced by about 20 different species of Shorea trees. The seeds from these fruits contain an oil whose chemical and physical properties are remarkably similar to cocoa butter. Large quantities of illipe nuts are collected and sold to be used in the manufacture of chocolate (as a cocoa butter improver), soap and cosmetics. Indonesia dominates world trade in illipe nuts, exporting about 15 000 tonnes annually, worth about US$8 million. 12 Salanganes or bird nests are built by two species of cave-dwelling swiftlets, Collocalia fuciphaga and C. maxima in Malaysia and Thailand. These are collected for sale to the Chinese market at home and abroad. Malaysia is the major producer and exporter of bird nests. Malaysian exports during 1991 totalled 18.6 tonnes, mainly to Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and Taiwan, valued at around US$1 million. Karaya gum, also known as Indian tragacanth, is obtained from tapping trees of the genus Sterculia . India is the only major producer. Total world production is about 5 500 tonnes per annum. Kapok is a mass of silky fibres in the fruit of the ceiba tree ( Ceiba pentandra ), used as a filling for mattresses, life preservers, and sleeping bags and as insulation. The tree grows in many South Asian countries but also on the Pacific islands, in Africa and in Central America. Thailand and Indonesia are the main suppliers in the world trade. Japan, China, the European Union and the United States are the major markets. During 1992 the total value of world trade was approximately US$11 million, of which about 66 percent was contributed by Thailand and 16 percent by Indonesia. Thailand and India dominate world trade in shellac, each exporting, on average, about 6 000 tonnes per annum. Shellac is an animal product. The basic material comes from the Coccus lacca, a scaly insect that feeds on certain trees in India and southern Asia. After feeding, the insect produces through its pores a gummy substance which hardens into a protective covering called lac. This lac is collected and then it is crushed, washed and dried. After further treatment, it is skillfully drawn into thin sheets of finished shellac. Vietnamese annual exports average around 300 tonnes. China produces about 3 000 tonnes. At country and local levels, there are still many more NWFP that are important for subsistence and the income generation activities of rural people (such as bushmeat, wild honey, fodder). Descriptive and qualitative information on them is included in the specific country profiles, as well as information on ecotourism in forests, when available. Forest services are also important in the region. Most of the countries of the study have established protected forest areas, developed both national parks and forest recreation services and are emphasizing the development of ecotourism as a means of income generation for the country. Sustainability has been taken into account in this development; for instance the Wildlife Institute of India has initiated studies and experiments in the high altitude forests in the Garhwal Himalayas to assess tourism impact on habitats and wildlife for the planning of sustainable tourism. Governments have been prompted to support and promote an active conservation policy regarding natural resource areas. Protected areas (e.g. national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, reserves) provide ecotourism services while also playing a significant role in the preservation of biodiversity and the gene reserves of the region. Protected areas provide habitats for endangered animals, such as the Bengal tiger, spotted deer, crocodiles, jungle fowl, wild boar, lizards and rhesus monkeys in Bangladesh. Outdoor recreation is in great demand for many people living in big cities. Other important non- wood services derived from forests are grazing and fishing. Forest wildlife also has a symbolic significance for local people. In Papua New Guinea, for instance, different clans have special relationships with particular species that serve as their totems and the wildlife contributes to the cultural identity of the villagers. 13 14Table 3.

Some products which were less important some years ago are now becoming more important (e.g. bamboo shoots). At the same time, others which were among the most important are now becoming scarce and as a result they are no longer considered at this moment to be important but continue to be mentioned on the list of recorded NWFP (e.g. dammar resin). The ranking of NWFP is a difficult process. The importance of these products is very much dependent on their availability and accessibility in certain geographical areas, the attitude and preferences of the local population, market demand, the contribution they make to families and the national economy and also the categories of people involved in the ranking process. Unlike timber, NWFP have multistakeholders who directly benefit from NWFP through free access to the natural resources. In some countries the interest and activity of local people in NWFP have increased. The private sector has started to invest in small-scale NWFP-processing industries and local people have started to domesticate some NWFP (e.g. medicinal plants in home gardens). Some communities have initiated sustainable-use systems, for example fish conservation zones, frog conservation schemes and other NWFP-use rules and multivillage agreements to conserve large blocks of forests. NWFP contribute to food security by supplementing agricultural crops during seasonal shortages. They are also important for health care, materials for farm implements and construction, fodder and for fuelwood. In given cases, NWFP may yield higher economic returns than upland agriculture or timber forest products (e.g. mushrooms). It is also important to note that urbanization can increase the demand for NWFP, as people moving from rural areas maintain and disseminate their consumption patterns in the cities (e.g. consumption of wild honey). The irregular and subsistence nature in consumption of these products makes it difficult to gather useful and reliable information on them, as the users keep no records. Sometimes users may neglect and undervalue these products as in most cases they do not earn any direct cash benefits from them and they gather these products largely free of charge utilizing only their labour and time inputs. Currently the usage of NWFP is still quantified poorly and usually their value is not included in forest valuations. Some countries have attempted to compile statistics for (some of the major) NWFP used in national forest statistics. However, for most of the species used by local people, no reliable statistics exist. Forest-use practices and patterns change with the increasing pressures of population growth and market economies. Where community land is poor, NWFP are used to generate income as raw materials for cottage industries. Only some NWFP are being managed properly as a business entity (e.g. bamboo plantations in China). Property rights or ownership of the NWFP resources have not been well defined in most of the countries. In some cases the collection of NWFP is entirely free and only very seldom is a collection licence needed; if one is required, it is seldom verified. This has led to the unregulated collection of most NWFP, such as rattan, wild honey and key medicinal plants. Presently much support for NWFP collectors is being provided through (inter-)national support programmes, as they are the primary target groups for poverty alleviation programmes; mostly this is done by improving their marketing channels for commercialization of their NWFP. In the 17NWFP marketing chain, collectors suffer most when resource scarcity problems arise because of increased NWFP commercialization. Middlemen and contractors often take advantage of people's ignorance regarding the actual market prices, as alternative marketing channels are not so easily available to the local collectors. Middlemen tend to exploit the ignorance of collectors and growers and offer insignificant returns to them. The NWFP sector is a labour-intensive industry and faces various problems, such as minimal capital investment, a low percentage of skilled labour, a low technological level in product processing, poor quality control and lack of marketing skills. In addition, extraction, processing, production and marketing of most NWFP are carried out in traditional ways using worn-out equipment or obsolete methods. The potential of many NWFP is not being utilized fully because of insufficient knowledge and experience on modern processing techniques and lack of product development. In order to reduce the pressure on remaining NWFP resources, and to utilize the full potential of NWFP to provide employment and increase the income levels of rural people, more attention should be given to domesticating important plants and promoting their cultivation by individuals, communities, private industries etc., (i.e. rattan, bamboo and some medicinal plants). Useful plants should be cultivated in home gardens and on other agricultural land, and their cultivation could be included and further promoted in agroforestry management systems. The Asia-Pacific Forestry Sector Outlook Study, conducted by FAO in 1998, included a study on NWFP: \"Non-Wood Forest Products Outlook Study for Asia and the Pacific\". According to this study, major findings and the problems associated with the development of NWFP in the Asia- Pacific region included problems associated with the collection and analysis of statistical data on NWFP. In addition, countries are facing depletion of their NWFP resources because of, on the one hand inadequately regulated harvesting, and on the other hand the increasing market demand for commercially popular species (e.g. rattan, gaharu trees , various barks, roots, stems and leaves used as medicines). Also, the NWFP sector tends to be overlooked or discounted in national-level forest programmes and resource planning due to the lack of investment in research and development, institutional and policy neglect, and because of the small scale of the industry. The NWFP-dependent communities continue to be weak economically. Collectors are facing limited marketing options or negotiating power and are faced typically with only a single buyer. Inventory information is scarce and forest management is timber-oriented. The success of NWFP development in many places will depend on the ability to implement management systems which recognize and promote the production of both timber and non-timber resources. Conclusions NWFP have multiple uses and involve multistakeholders with conflicting needs; these are very difficult to deal with in terms of resource assessment, management and control, ownership, access rights and trade regulation. NWFP regulations are inadequate. In addition, NWFP resources have not been identified or mapped sufficiently to inform NWFP stakeholders about key species and zones for conservation, domestic consumption and commercial development for sector planning, research and development. In various countries, the concerned line ministry and its technical departments cannot cope with the huge demand for technical advice and support from the various stakeholders in the sector. However, governments are now paying more attention and are becoming involved increasingly in the development of their NWFP sectors. Some are evincing strong interest and already have undertaken assessments of research and development needs and of the ways to improve the coordination of relevant activities and the collection and dissemination of information about NWFP. 18The country reports in this document vary in depth of coverage and in their approaches. Some papers provide descriptive information complemented or not with statistical data and many others illustrate discrepancies among existing figures from various sources. Within the scope of this study no attempts could be made to analyse and explain these discrepancies. Also, the quality of bibliographies attached to the country reports is variable and often the statistical data is provided without quotation to the original source. In some papers either local or trade names are provided making the identification of the species providing the product difficult. All country reports expressed the need to assist further the development of their NWFP sectors. Many of the country reports reveal the difficulties in obtaining data and information on potential sources and distribution, ecology, uses, harvesting and processing methods, trade prospects and the depletion rates of major NWFP. Therefore it was proposed to place major NWFP in the list of priorities of local and central governments. Also, the inventory of valuable NWFP resources is very important in order to understand their potential production, their location and distribution. The inventory of NWFP resources should involve the NWFP collectors with assistance from local governments, local scientists, forestry authorities and research institutions. The constraints for the development of NWFP in the countries reviewed in this study can be summarized as follows: /circle6 Lack of coordination among the existing institutions and countries. /circle6 Insufficient research and development activities for the key NWFP. /circle6 Lack of conservation and management policies for sustainable production. /circle6 Few initiatives to involve and assist the private sector in NWFP development. Since existing knowledge on NWFP is poor, there is a need to carry out research, field surveys and resource assessments in order to obtain the required data for the development of this resource. The following are the major areas identified for further research and development work: /circle6 Resource inventories of key NWFP species. /circle6 Ethnobotanic studies to improve knowledge on utilization of NWFP. /circle6 Growth and yield studies and natural regeneration studies of key NWFP species. /circle6 Studies on propagation, domestication techniques and genetic improvement. /circle6 Improvements in processing, transport and storage techniques. /circle6 Income generation and market surveys. /circle6 Focused marketing studies on key NWFP for national and Asian markets.

Other important NWFP include mangrove fish and wildlife resources. General information In Bangladesh, all usufructs/utility products of plant, animal and mineral origins except timber obtainable from forests or afforested lands are defined as Minor Forest Products (MFP). Services for tourism and recreation in forests are also attributed as MFP. NWFP are consumed mostly by local people, who also harvest them. The increased demand for NWFP is causing high pressure on the NWFP resources owing to continued extraction from the forests. Table 1.

Sources: Bangladesh Export Statistics (1992-1993), Export Promotion Bureau, Dhaka; Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (1987) The Government of Bangladesh collects significant earnings from the royalties, taxes and other charges on NWFP. Modest export earnings are derived from the sale of bamboo and shells. Sophisticated finished articles and souvenirs made from NWFP are major exportable items that often carry with them the cultural dignity of the nation. The collection, processing and marketing of NWFP provides employment for an estimated 300 000 rural Bangladeshis (Khan 1994). Much of this employment continues throughout the year. The Sundarbans mangrove forest accounts for a major part of the NWFP produced in Bangladesh with an annual contribution of approximately Tk.717 million (US$17.9 million) to the Bangladesh economy (Basit 1995). PLANTS AND PLANT PRODUCTS Food Edible plants in Bangladesh include various species, such as Acrostichium provide subsistence food for the local people. No current information is available on the utilization of mushrooms. Medicines The leaves, bark, and fruit of many plants are used commonly as medicines in Bangladesh. Among the most common in the Sundarbans, which yield essential oils for perfumery as well as medicinal uses. The leaves of B. lacera yield 0.5 percent of essential oil, after steam distillation, from which camphor is made. The root is also medicinal. Another species, B. densiflora also yields camphor. An essential oil called kewa katta attar is produced odoratissimus . Kewa katta attar is a highly popular perfume that has been extracted and used since ancient times. It blends well with almost all types of perfumes and is used for, inter alia , scenting clothes, bouquets, lotions and cosmetics. Kewa katta and water are used for flavouring various foods, sweets, syrups and soft drinks. Cyprus 22javanicus is used commercially for the extraction of essential oil from its tuberous roots that are aromatic and may be useful for perfumes and agarbatties or joss sticks. Dyeing and tanning Excellent grades of leather are produced from mangrove bark tannins. Bangladesh tans huge quantities of leather. Skins are tanned with the tannin extracts from bark, fruits and leaves of local trees in the Sundarbans mangroves, along with some imported tanning material. Data on the production of tanning barks are not available. The economic value of catechu bark for tannin in Bangladesh was Tk.77 million from the Sundarbans for the extraction of tannins. Many of the tannin factories in Bangladesh have, however, depended considerably on imported tannin extracts. About 10 000 tonnes of mangrove bark are estimated to be harvested annually at the felling coups in the Sundarbans. Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials The golpatta palm ( Nypa fruticans ) has a variety of uses. The leaves are used principally as thatching material, but they can also be made into bags, baskets, hats, mats, raincoats and wrappers. The leaf's mid-ribs can be made into brooms. Sun-dried petioles are cut as firewood and fresh petioles are used as tying materials and coarse brushes. Sap can be used in the production of alcohol, wine, sugar and vinegar. Ripe fruits can be eaten raw (Basit 1995). Young shoots, decayed wood, burnt roots or leaves are useful for the treatment of herpes, toothache and headache. Annually about 19 200 people collect golpatta fronds and market them in nearby communities (Basit 1995). According to the Forest Department the annual production during 1991 to 1992 and 1992 to 1993 was 74 583 and 75 600 tonnes respectively. The present average annual production of golpatta leaves is about 75 600 tonnes. The estimated productive area of golpatta in the Sundarbans forest is about 595 739 ha (Basit 1995). Some researchers have reported the species to be endangered. After golpatta, the hantal palm ( Phoenix paludosa ) is the next most important palm in the Sundarbans. Hantal is a small, clump-forming erect palm. It is a valuable material for villagers near the Sundarbans. Stems are harvested and used as purlins and rafters for village houses, as posts for trellises for growing betel leaf, and for animal shelters and fencing. The leaves are used in the making of walls for houses and other shelters (Basit 1995). Table 2.

Sungrass grows naturally, especially in the 23forests of low-lying areas, or around the denuded and barren hills that are unfit for growing high- quality timber trees (Khan 1994). Green sungrass is used locally as fodder. Murta (pati pata) (Clinogynae ) grows naturally in the low-lying areas of Sylhet and also in rural areas of Tagail and Dhaka districts. It can be grown artificially in other areas of the country using suitable planting material. Pati pata is an excellent material for floor mats and woven utensils, and is used extensively by the rich and poor alike. Finished products are exported (Khan 1994). Hogla ( Typha elephantina Roxb.) leaves are woven into mats that are used for beds, to dry crops on and for prayer mats. They are also used for making storage containers and hut walls. The young succulent leaves are a palatable forage crop for animals. Hogla pollen grains are collected and sold in the markets or used to make home-made cakes (Basit 1995). The value of murta and hogla production together was Tk.8.3 million in bamboo (e.g. Melocanna baccifera , Bambusa tulda ) is grouped officially as an MFP, it plays a crucial role in the rural economy of Bangladesh. Over 20 species of bamboo grow in Bangladesh's natural forests and village homesteads. Bamboo is used for hundreds of purposes and it is an essential material for the construction of temporary housing for rural people, especially hilltribes (Khan 1994). Table 3.

Canes are used for domestic purposes by the rural population and for processing into more sophisticated furniture and luxury souvenirs that are suitable for export (Khan 1994). In Bangladesh, MFP also includes stones, gravel and sand extraction in forests. Stone is one of the most important MFP, and is available only in some areas of Bangladesh, such as Sylhet, Hill Tracts and Dinajpur. Stone is required for the construction of highways, buildings and other infrastructural needs. In Dinajpur alone, there is an estimated deposit of 115 million cubic feet of hardstone. The Government of Bangladesh earns substantial revenue from the sale of stone (Khan 1994). ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS Honey and beeswax Honey and beeswax are important NWFP in the mangrove forests. Honey and pollen are used as medicines, high-energy food and as a source of vitamins and minerals. Honey is collected using the 24traditional method, which uses fire or smoke to drive away the bees, and in the process destroys the queen and the brood. The honey is sold to processors in nearby communities (Basit 1995). The collector's selling price is Tk.20 (US$0.50)/kg. Processed honey sells for Tk.80 (US$2.00). Honey and beeswax collection, although a very risky job, continues to provide a seasonal source of income. An average of 2 640 collectors harvest honey and beeswax from the mangrove forests of the Sundarbans (Basit 1995). Table 4.

Honey is produced from the forest regions of the Sundarbans, Chittagong, Sylhet, Cox's Bazar and Mymensingh. Recently, apiculture has been introduced in some areas of north Bengal and Mymensingh District with considerable success (Khan 1994). Other animal products Fishing and shell collection within the mangroves are controlled by the Forest Department, and for a long time have been considered to be extremely valuable forest produce in the Sundarbans. Fish, prawns, shells and other fishery resources abound in the rivers and water systems within the Sundarbans and serve as a major source of food and employment, as well as providing revenue for the government (Basit 1995). Recently the cultivation of Bagda shrimp has revolutionized fish harvesting in the Sundarbans. From 1990 to 1991, 4 821.4 tonnes of fish were harvested (Alam 1992; Salamat 1994). Some 67 000 boats crewed by 165 000 fishermen annually visit the Sundarbans mangroves and fish for their livelihoods. Recent data reveal that the collection of \"seed\" prawns involves about 25 000 men, women and children. Shell collection also contributes to the employment of young boys and girls. The number of shell collectors increases during the winter tourist season (Basit 1995). Table 5.

FOREST SERVICES The actual level of tourism has remained low, underscored by figures which indicate that less than 10 000 visitors entered the country in 1992. Domestic tourism on the other hand appears to be a strongly growing sector of the market and it is believed widely that emphasis should be placed on the development of this sector to increase the country's share of international tourism. The main tourist attractions in Bangladesh include the Sundarbans mangroves for wildlife photography, touring the mangrove forest, boating, and meeting local fishermen, woodcutters and honey collectors. The Sundarbans is the natural habitat of the world-famous Bengal tiger, spotted deer, crocodiles, jungle fowl, wild boar, lizards, rhesus monkeys and a great variety of birds. Boats are the only means of transportation inside the forest. There are no roads (Basit 1995). Three types of 26protected areas are defined in the Bangladesh Wildlife Preservation Act (1974): Wildlife Sanctuary, National Park and Game Reserve (Hussain 1986). Table 6.

Other NWFP include honey and beeswax. General information NWFP affect nearly every aspect of the life of a Bhutanese citizen. The country's forests provide food, fodder, medicine, oils, resins, fibres, dyes and raw materials for baskets, traditional paper, houses, brooms, mats and numerous other items (FAO 1996). Approximately 840 species of NWFP used for various purposes have been documented but most of the species used by rural people remain undocumented. Table 1.

Some NWFP are also traded internationally. People in rural areas earn extra income by collecting and processing NWFP or working in small manufacturing units established in the country. NWFP collection, by nature, is seasonal and occurs during the off-farm season (FAO 1995). PLANTS AND PLANT PRODUCTS Food Forests play an important role in assuring food security in the country. Due to variable climatic conditions, drought and poor soil, food problems occur throughout Bhutan periodically. For instance an important substitute for grains is Dioscoria . Fern shoots, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, cane shoots and even orchid flowers and other wild vegetables from the forests are used by villagers (FAO 1995). The most common edible mushrooms all mushrooms. Shiitake ( Lentinus edodes) is cultivated by many farmers in Thimphu and there is considerable potential for cultivating other mushrooms like Pleurotus spp. and sangay in Bhutan . Mushrooms are also exported. In 1998, the amount of Tricoloma matsutake exports increased, due to their high price. Mushrooms in general, 31and Cantharellus cibarius in particular, are canned and sold for as much as Nu.50 (US$1.65)/kg (FAO 1995). 32Table 2.

Coconut oil, soya-bean oil and mustard oil are imported from India and palm oil from Malaysia. Small quantities of mustard oil are produced locally. There is good potential for producing edible oils within the country. The potential for exporting edible oils needs to be studied further as there are many wild plants that yield edible oil in Bhutan, of forest fruits is collected (e.g Phyllanthus emblica) and marketed (FAO 1995). Forests also produce spices, which are used locally and exported. Pepper is one of the most important spices that is collected. Cinnamomum bark and leaves are collected and exported. The seeds of Zanthoxylum are used extensively in the country (FAO 1995). Other important plants used as spices are Allium spp., Illicium anisatum and Phoenix humilis and Pinus roxburghii are edible, but they are used at the local level only. However, the nuts of Juglans regia have a high potential for export. The following forest plants are used as vegetables: Cymbidium grandiflorum (flowers), Adhatoda vasica (terminal shoots), Braken fern (shoots), Pandanus sp. (terminal shoots), Musa sp. (terminal shoots and inflorescence), bamboo (shoots), Asparagus (shoots), Alocasia sp. and Elatosteme sp. Asparagus is cultivated by farmers in Thimphu and it commands a high price in local as well as export markets. Table 3.

Fodder More than 80 percent of the people of Bhutan depend on agriculture and animal husbandry for their livelihoods. The farming system in Bhutan depends on the forests (FAO 1995). About 80 percent of the total animal fodder requirement is met by utilizing agricultural residues but the pressure in the forest is very high in districts where the head of cattle is very large. Almost every household maintains a few cattle for draught power, animal products and for their manure. Many people maintain large herds as a status symbol or as insurance in times of difficulty. The animal population has been recorded as 300 000 cattle and buffaloes; 28 000 yak; 40 000 sheep; 42 000 goats and 22 000 horses (FAO 1995). These animals largely depend on the forests for fodder. Herders drive the animals into the forests to forage for whatever is available 33and thus much of the forest is used as grazing land. During winter, when fodder in the forests of the colder highlands becomes scarce, cattle are moved down to warmer areas in the valleys. Medicines More than 600 medicinal plants have been reported in Bhutan. About 250 plants are used commonly by the traditional practitioners of the Gso-ba-rig-pa system of medicine. Almost all the medicinal plants are collected from the forest. Indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants is handed down from father to son. Some healers combine spiritualism and perform elaborate rituals while dispensing medicines (FAO 1995). The National Institute of Traditional Medicine (NITM) is the only institute with a programme for cultivating medicinal plants. Large quantities of Innula helenium (manu) and Saussurea lappa (ruta) are cultivated and are used locally for medicinal purposes either at the NITM or by the villagers themselves. There is good scope for the cultivation of more medicinal plants and for developing a medicinal plants industry that could generate employment for a large number of people and also earn foreign exchange. Pipla ( Piper longum ) is one of the most important medicinal plants. Chirata (Swertia chirata ) is used as medicine by the local people. The exact quantity used by the villagers is not documented. The heartwood of Acacia catechu Katha is exported to India. Oil is also extracted from agarwood ( Aquilaria agallocha ). In Bhutan, oil from agar is not extracted because the quantity available is so small that setting up an extraction unit is not viable. Only a small quantity of agarwood is exported and this quantity is reported together with the exports of katha. From 1999 the export of katha roots has been banned with the implementation of the Timber Marketing and Pricing Policy by the Ministry of Agriculture. Table 4.

Essential oils occur in some 60 plant families and almost any part of a plant may yield oil (FAO 1996). Table 5. Exports of lemon grass oil Year Quantity (litres) Value (Nu) 1997 58 636 13 457 608 1998 16 306 9 960 555 1999 21 504 6 480 413 Source: Royal Government of Bhutan (1997, 1998 and 1999) 34Lemon grass collection and oil extraction have enormous potential as a source of employment for villagers and oil exports have good prospects for earning foreign exchange. Lemon grass distillation provides incomes for around 400 families in the eastern districts. For these families, distillation has become an even more important source of income than farming (FAO 1995). Of all the Bhutanese NWFP this commodity has the most direct impact on the earning capacity of a large number of villagers in areas where the plant is abundant. Dyeing and tanning Natural dyes are another group of NWFP that are associated with the traditional art and culture of Bhutan. Cloth weaving is an important economic activity in the central and eastern districts. Gradually, natural dyes are being replaced by chemicals or ready-made thread. Improvements in the quality of natural dyes may revive their use. A project at Khaling in eastern Bhutan is compiling research results and other information on natural dyes (FAO 1995). The dyes can be grouped under five mineral salts [dochur] and oxidized iron [marchelo]). Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials Traditional hand-made paper is manufactured from Daphne spp. and Edgeworthia spp. About 4 000 to 5 000 acres are covered by these species. The hand-made paper is very strong and durable and no chemicals are added while manufacturing the paper. Many small family-operated factories are engaged in the manufacturing of this paper. The only semi-mechanized unit is in Thimphu (M/S Jungshi Hand-made Paper Factory). The annual raw material requirement of this factory is about 32 000 kg (full capacity) but since raw material is in short supply, utilization of the factory at full capacity is not possible. Hand-made paper has very high demand both within the country as well as in the export market and the paper is often preferred to other kinds of paper. The most important rattan used for making ropes, furniture frames, walking sticks, umbrella handles and other household items such as mats, screens and furniture. Raw rattan canes are also exported. Table 6.

Important bamboo genera are Arundinaria, Bambusa, Dendrocalamus, Thamnocalamus and Drepanostachyum . Bamboo is used for making baskets, rope and also containers. Young bamboo shoots are used as vegetables. Bamboo is consumed locally and internationally. The making of fine bamboo baskets and containers is a specialty of the people in eastern districts. Such products are marketed all over Bhutan and are also popular with tourists (FAO 1995). Many 35poor houses are made entirely of bamboo. The small bamboos that are found in central and west Bhutan are also woven into mats, used for fencing and for roofing temporary shelters (FAO 1995). Table 7.

Fibres of economic importance are obtained from the Sterculaceae, Leguminoceae, use the fibres for various purposes (e.g. rope making and weaving mats). Bhutanese fibre species include rope, Girardiana spp. for producing ropes and gunny bags, Musa spp. for paper making and Areca catechu. Other fibre- producing species are sp., Kydia calycina and Grewia sp. (FAO 1996). Floss is obtained from tree pods, and collected from capsules of these trees yield floss which is soft, yet strong. Gossypium and Bombax ceiba grow in the subtropical areas of southern Bhutan. Rural Bhutanese collect floss to make pillows and mattresses. Another floss species is kapok, Ceiba pentandra (FAO 1996). The most common species used to make brooms is Thysanolaena maxima, known locally as kucho, amkso or tsakusha. Other materials used for brooms are lemon grass, pal (cari or sysam in Sharchop-kha), Phoebe, Sida, bamboo leaves and split bamboo culms, and coconut leaves (FAO 1996). About 1 500 kg of grass for making good quality brooms were exported in 1997 (earnings of Nu.1 162). Locally, the use of grass for making brooms is quite high, but no data are available. Handicraft items are famous in Bhutan. These items are used locally for various purposes, as well as being exported. The socio-economic importance of the units manufacturing handicraft items is high because many people depend on this profession. Table 8.

The demand for incense sticks is very high since they are used daily in households for offering morning and evening prayers. Some of the commonly used species used are Juniperus There are good prospects for setting up small- scale units for manufacturing incense sticks and creating more jobs in Bhutan. Table 9.

They are planted either in their houses, in compounds or in public places. In 1997 about 28 000 planting materials such as bulbs, tubers and roots of different plants were exported; they were valued at Nu.435 000. Important ornamental plants at the national is cultivated also. is obtained from tapping chirpine trees (Pinus roxburghii). Turpentine and rosin are two important bi-products obtained by resin distillation and they are exported mainly to India. Resin tapping is one of the most important economic activities in the eastern part of Bhutan. According to the study conducted by FRDD/DoFs (2000) about 44 percent of the population in eastern Bhutan is engaged in this activity. Table 10.

As the distilleries are next to farms, local farmers work in the distilleries when they are free. These activities directly contribute more than Nu.30 million (US$1 million) to the rural economy. No major expansion is envisaged for resin production and the main emphasis is to refine the tapping technique so that the trees are not damaged. Wax is obtained from the seeds of Rhus verniciflua and Rhus syccedanea . ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS Honey and beeswax Honey in Bhutan is provided by wild bees ( Apis dorsata ) and domesticated bees ( Apis indica ). Most of the honey collected is consumed locally and only a small quantity is exported to India. In 371999 about 1 020 kg of honey were exported (from the Apis indica bees), with a reported value of Nu.98 100 (Trade Statistics of Bhutan 1999). Beeswax is obtained from the honeycomb of bees and wasps ( Apis spp.). Villagers collect the honeycombs, drain the honey and melt the empty honeycombs. The impurities are removed and the remaining material is wax. REFERENCES FAO. 1995. Non-wood forest products of Bhutan.

FOREST SERVICES Bhutan has extensive areas managed under the Protected Area Management system including areas such as National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries and Reserves. These areas account for 26 percent of the geographical area of the country. Another 9 percent is declared as biological corridors, which link the National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries located in different ecological zones. The most important non-wood services derived from forest are grazing and fishing. About 90 percent of the population in Bhutan own livestock. Livestock is an integral feature of the farming system and it supports agricultural land use through the provision of manure and draught power. The Forest and Nature Conservation Act (1995) allows grazing and collection of firewood, fodder and leaf mould for domestic use, either free or on payment of royalty. Firewood collection is permitted only from dead and fallen trees. There are some areas (tsamdos) within the Government Reserved Forest, which are leased annually to herdsmen or communities at Nu.100.00/year/tsamdo. Grazing is a usufructuary right of the villagers. The Forest and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan, 1995 gives authority to the Department of Forestry Services to regulate and restrict grazing anywhere in the country, in order to prevent environmental damage. The national cattle population is decreasing (in 1992 about 310 000 compared to 400 000 in 1990). This decrease may be attributed to the introduction of improved breeds, but it is also a possible result of exceeding the carrying capacity of the shrinking grazing resources (Dorji 1993, quoted in Davidson 2000). This decrease in the cattle population might also reduce cattle-grazing pressure in the forest. Because of heavy and free range grazing, the productivity of the forest seems to have declined. The decline may also be because of the expansion of unpalatable plant communities dominated by is a major source of nutrition for most rural households.

Other NWFP include mushrooms, medicinal plants and incense. General information Cambodia has significant natural resources that could supply its people and foreign investors with many kinds of raw materials. The last 30 years of war have seriously depleted the forest infrastructure and the documentation on NWFP is scarce (Hang Suntra 1995). Currently people are collecting NWFP mainly for nourishment, housing, health care and small industries. Most of the population is rural and more than 85 percent of the total population is settled along the Tonle Sap and Mekong rivers, as well as around the Tonle Sap Great Lake. Besides rice, which is the main source of nourishment, the products coming from the forest play a very important role in the nation's economy, although unfortunately the role and importance of NWFP has not been recognized adequately.

They also provide income. Harvesting is conducted during both the rainy and dry seasons, depending on the kind of mushrooms. Mushrooms can be dried for storage, but they are also consumed fresh. Mushrooms are found almost everywhere. The collection of mushrooms is free and there is no management system. The amount of mushrooms harvested depends on the demand. The amount of mushrooms collected by one person per day is 3 to 5 kg. The price for 1 kg is CR500 to 1 500 (US$1.00 = CR3 900). The Sandorium indicum and Elaeocarpus madopetalus Several forest plants are used as medicines in Cambodia but not much documentation is available. The following species and plant parts have been reported: Spirolobium (bark and stumps), Cinnamomum incerme (roots and (seeds and fruit), (yam), Albizza lebbek seeds and flowers), spp.). The documentation on fragrant plants in Cambodia is also scarce. Some species of fragrant plants are used for the treatment of diseases, for example the fragrant juice of the trunk of Aquilaria crasna and the incence from the chhnot and Pterocarpus santalinus. Exudates An important Cambodian alatus is used for waterproofing wooden boats and for candles. It is also used for fishery equipment and for improving fish storage. The Dipterocarpus alatus tree is found almost anywhere near streams and the harvest is conducted depending on the demand. The harvesting takes place during the dry season (December to May) when the quality of the resin is better. The trees are owned and managed by local people and heritage rights to tap a tree can be awarded. The trees are also under the management of the Department of Forestry and Wildlife. Dipterocarpus alatus resin is often mixed with resin from Shorea vulgaris. Another resin- providing tree is Shorea guiso , but nowadays it is difficult to find since its habitat has been degraded. Resins are also exported to the neighbouring countries of Viet Nam and Thailand. Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials Rattan is the most important raw material for handicrafts, tools and construction. Calamus salicifolius and Calamus dioicus (rum peak) are used for handicrafts, baskets and fishing tools. Calamus salicifolius is found almost everywhere, except in the mountain zone. Harvesting is conducted when people are free from farming or rice-harvesting activities. There is no management of Calamus salicifolius and collection is free. Calamus petrreus (phdov dambong) is used for handicrafts and furniture and farm tools. Harvesting is conducted mostly by local people and usually after the rainy season (December - April). Calamus petrreus is found in almost all natural forest areas. The management of Calamus petrreus is under the responsibility of the Department of Forestry and Wildlife, Ministry of Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry. Var yiev ( Strychnos axillaris ) is a very popular fibre source in Cambodia for making fishing tools and house construction. Other fibre species used are Cyclea peltata, Chukrasia tabularis and other species (their botanical names are not known). The harvesting of Strychnos axillaris is conducted after the rainy season and the species is found in all of the natural forest area. 45Bamboo is used widely for house construction in Cambodia are also used for the production of paper, farm tools and fishing tools. Items made of bamboo include baskets, chopsticks, lattice (floor grating), columns of cottages, carrying bars (shoulder perched) and palm juice containers/tubes. Harvesting is conducted throughout the year. Bamboo is found mostly in the dense and semidense forest areas of western and northeastern Cambodia. The resource is under the management of the Department of Forestry and Wildlife but people are free to collect it for home consumption. Dendrocalamus membranacceus is grown on farms. ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS Medicines Some wildlife species are used for the treatment of diseases, such as: Hystrix cristata (stomach), black monkey (blood/bone). Manus javanika is also used as a medicine. REFERENCES Annual Report of CAMFOREXIM (Cambodia Forestry Export and Import Office). 1994- 1995. Annual Report of Ministry of Commerce. 1983-1993.

General information NWFP hold great significance in China for the nutrition and health care of rural households. NWFP statistics have been compiled on data which were issued in publications such as Forestry Yearbook of China (1980-1997), Forestry Information of China (1980-1996), Agriculture Yearbook of China (1980-1996) and the Chinese Customs Yearbook (1996). In China, NWFP are divided into 10 categories: woody plants for food and oil; resins; perfumes animal; products; bamboo and rattan; fruits and nuts. In addition, forest services (including ecotourism) are included in the concept of NWFP. Table 1.

Presently, the economic forests of China have an annual production value of over \u00a540 000 million. Economic forests are established for cash crops of (woody) plants for food, fruits, nuts, tea, silk and medicines. At present, there are over 1 000 factories, employing over 100 000 people, and producing many kinds of products; they form an integrated production system based on the chemical extraction and processing of harvested NWFP from economic forests.

The NWFP are marketed domestically and internationally and a substantial proportion of NWFP is consumed by farmers and householders in the forest regions. Most of the NWFP is obtained from natural forest, but an increasing amount is being produced in plantations (economic forests; bamboo shoots, fruits and nuts are cultivated intensively. Resin, tong oil and tallow are collected from natural stands or plantations. Most NWFP are collected in small quantities, seasonally and manually, by women and children. Table 3.

Annually, over 1 000 tonnes of dried mushrooms are exported at a value of US$20 million. According to the Forestry Statistics (1977) the forestry sector produced 0.176 million tonnes of edible mushrooms and wild ferns. Edible mushrooms are a major NWFP in China. Chinese mushrooms are also popular in international markets. Mushrooms exported from China are mainly black and white auricular fungus, winter mushroom and pine mushroom. The total production of black auricular fungus ( Auricularia auricula ) and its production per unit area are increasing every year as cultivation techniques improve and better strains are being utilized. China is the main world producer of this fungus with an annual production of 46 000 tonnes and annual exports of about 1 000 tonnes, earning close to US$8 million. Most of the exports are to Japan, Southeast Asia, western Europe and northern America. About 1 000 tonnes of white auricular fungus (Tremella fuciformis ) are produced every year, of which about 300 tonnes are exported. 51 Winter mushroom (shiitake) ( Lentinus edodes ) is one of the best edible mushrooms in the world. China is the largest producer of winter mushroom in the world with production of around 120 000 tonnes. Annually, over 1 000 tonnes of dried winter mushroom are exported at a price of some US$2 000/tonne. Other 1994). The forestry sector produced 23.5 million tonnes of fruits (mainly apples, pears and oranges in economic forest plantations) and 0.5 million tonnes of nuts in 1997 (National Forestry Bureau 1997). The annual production of fruits increased on average by 11.4 percent (1.3 million tonnes) from 1979 to 1992. The increase in fruit production will slow down in the future. The production of nuts is increasing annually by more than 5 percent. The domestic consumption of fruits and nuts has increased from 9.037 million tonnes in 1980 to 50.465 million tonnes in 1995. Chestnut ( Castanea spp.) plantations cover a total area of some 300 000 ha. The annual production of chestnuts averages about 330 000 tonnes, accounting for one-tenth of the world total. China exports annually some 25 000 tonnes of chestnuts (mostly to Japan), earning about US$50 million (Kunshan 1994). The total area of walnut ( Juglans regia. ) plantations in the country is over 1 million ha, and annual production averages about 250 000 tonnes. The nuts contain protein and fat. The annual export quantity of walnuts from China is about 47 000 tonnes, with an export value of US$30 to 50 million. Walnuts are exported mainly to Europe, Canada and other countries in Asia (Kunshan 1994). Many wild vegetables are found in the forests of northeastern China. There are over 100 species of edible ferns in the forests of Heilongjiang Province. Currently, about 2 000 tonnes of wild brake (Pteridium aquilum ) are collected each year when the collection potential could be some 100 000 tonnes. Ferns are increasingly in demand on international markets and their price is rising (to over US$10 000/tonnes for Pteridium aquilum and Osmunda cinnamome ). Chinese wild vegetables are exported mainly to Japan, where the demand for salted wild vegetables is over 10 000 tonnes per year. Chinese root vegetables are popular in Germany, the United States and Japan. Bamboo shoots are another major output; they are a traditional component of Chinese food. Each year about 1.6 million tonnes of fresh bamboo shoots are harvested. Jujube ( Zizyphus spp.) is another important wild vegetable. The total area of jujube is about 240 000 ha and the annual production of fresh jujube is 400 000 tonnes. China exports about 4 700 tonnes of dry jujube, earning US$5 million in foreign exchange each year (Kunshan 1994). Tea oil (Camellia oleigera ) grows in 15 provinces over an area of more than 4 million ha. The annual production of tea oil is 500 tonnes, accounting for 8.6 percent of the edible plant oil produced in the country. In Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, which are the central production areas of tea oil in China, over half of the edible oil consumed in the rural areas is tea oil. Saponin, which can be extracted from tea dregs, is used to manufacture cleansers, detergents, foaming agents and insecticides. It also acts as medicine to lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease (Kunshan 1994). Forest drinks are natural drinks, produced or extracted from tree juice, wild berries, fruit, leaves and flowers of plants, as well as the pollen of nectariferous plants. In 1997, China produced 74 600 tonnes of forest beverages. Forest drinks are made needle powder (Kunshan 1994). Birch juice is a popular soft drink in China. China has abundant birch resources, with 34 species covering a total area of 10 million ha. Products such as birch syrup, birch cola and birch honey peach produced by the Forest Drink Factory of Dailing Forestry Bureau, Heilongjiang Province, have an annual value of \u00a52.94 million (Kunshan 1994). Seabuckthorn ( Hippophae rhomnoides ) is a wild shrub growing in 20 provinces in northern China, covering an area of over 1 million ha. Seabuckthorn has rich nutritional and medicinal qualities. In 1990, there were over 150 seabuckthorn-processing factories in China, with an annual production capacity of about 150 000 tonnes. The variety of products made from seabuckthorn has evolved from the original crude juice and soft drinks, to over 200 finished products in eight different categories, including soft drinks, food, wine, daily-use chemicals, medicine, health protection, forage and additives. Fifteen tonnes of juice can be obtained from 1 ha of wild seabuckthorn forest. The Seabuckthorn Beverage Factory of Youyu County, Shanxi Province, has an annual production capacity of 4 000 tonnes, with production of 1 640 tonnes of condensed seabuckthorn juice, powder and light sparkling wine, valued at \u00a55 million. The total value of seabuckthorn products in the seven provinces in the middle and upper reaches of the Changjiang River exceeded \u00a5100 million in 1988. Joint ventures have been set up between China and the United States, Japan and Switzerland to develop seabuckthorn products (Kunshan 1994). Yangtao actinidia (Actinidia chinesis, better known under its international name \"kiwi\") is an important wild fruit, growing in 24 provinces, with an annual production of about 300 000 tonnes. Xixia County, Henan Province, has abundant yangtao actinidia with an average annual production of 2 500 tonnes. The biggest plantations of yangtao actinidia in China are situated in Sichuan Province. A research institute has been set up specifically to support yangtao actinidia development. Yangtao actinidia products such as drinks, wine and jam produced in Xixia County are sold both on domestic and international markets. The yangtao actinidia wine produced by Guanxian County Yangtao Actinidia Wine Factory, Sichuan Province, has won awards and wide recognition (Kunshan 1994). The fruits of black currant (Ribes nigrum ) are rich in nutrients and a variety of vitamins, organic acids, trace elements, sugar and others. Black currant can be processed into wine, fructose, fruit juice and jam. As one of the major NWFP in Heilongjiang Province, the cultivation area of black currant covers 14 000 ha supplying more than 70 processing factories (Kunshan 1994). Medicines The consumption of traditional Chinese drugs accounts for about 40 percent of the total consumption of medicaments in China. About 6 000 species of Chinese medicinal plants have been recorded and many of them grow in forests. Important medicinal plants include: ginseng, pilose antler, ( Panax ginseng ) is one of the key medicinal products from north China. Jilin Province, a major ginseng-producing area, produces about 80 percent of the ginseng of the country, making up around 40 percent of the world total (Kunshan 1994). American ginseng (Panax 53quinquefollius ) was introduced to China in 1975 and is planted in more than 10 provinces with an annual production of over 50 tonnes. Muling Forestry Bureau, Heilongjiang Province, is the biggest production base in China of American ginseng. The total annual sales exceed \u00a53.5 million. The bureau has experienced good economic results from the management of ginseng and American ginseng, employing more than 8 000 people in its operations (Kunshan 1994). The annual production of the fruit of common macrocarpium (Macrocarpium officinalis ) fluctuates between 600 and 900 tonnes. The production of fresh fruit is about 30 to 50 kg/ha. As of 1987, the total area planted reached 1 333 ha, with an annual production of 160 tonnes, producing an income of \u00a582 million (Kunshan 1994). Pilose antler is a high-grade tonic medicine costing \u00a51 300 to 1 400/kg (first class pilose antler produced in Jilin Province: \u00a52 260/kg). Over 30 tonnes of pilose antler were produced in Jilin Province in 1987, yet the supply falls short of the demand (Kunshan 1994). Gingko ( Ginkgo biloba ) is used as food and medicine. The annual production is 5 000 tonnes, most of which is exported. The foreign exchange earnings top US$7 million each year (Kunshan 1994). Great attention has been paid to the medical value of ginkgo kernel and leaf. Presently, ginkgo leaf is quite often in short supply on international markets. There are 0.7 to 0.8 million fruit-producing gingko trees and the annual production of kernels is 5 000 to 6 000 tonnes, the production of leaves amounts to 7 000 tonnes and the annual production of fleshy seed coats reaches 10 000 to 12 000 tonnes. About \u00a51 500 million can be earned through the export of ginkgo products. Pine needle powder is a supplementary forage for fowl and livestock. The cost of processing pine needle powder is about \u00a52/kg. As of 1987, 19 provinces had produced and used needle powder forage. Sixty pine needle powder factories have been established, with an annual production of 15 000 tonnes. Pine needle ointment is also used as a forage for fowl. Pine needle ointment has been shown to cure diseases of the mouth. A factory has been set up in Xugou Forestry Bureau, Lianyungang, Jiangsu Province to produce pine needle ointment (Kunshan 1994). Perfumes and cosmetics China's aromatic plant resources account for annual production of 20 000-30 000 tonnes of essential oils. There are 0.67 million ha of eucalyptus plantations in China. The annual production of eucalyptus oil is 4 500 tonnes, exports accounting for 2 580 tonnes. Mountain spicy tree ( Litsea cubeba ) is an important aromatic oil plant that is distributed widely in almost all provinces. Most parts of the plant, including the root, stem, leaf, bark and fruit, contain aromatic oil. Especially useful is the fruit, from which aromatic oil (cubeba oil) can be obtained. It can be used directly as fragrant materials in soda drinks and beer, and indirectly for perfume, medicine, plastics, synthetic rubber, printing and food. The Yiyang Chemical Factory, Hunan Province has produced a variety of products from the oil with an annual production value of \u00a58.5 million yuan. As the content of the oil is similar to that of coconut oil, it has been used in Hunan to replace the latter, saving a large amount of foreign exchange (Kunshan 1994). Dyeing and tanning In 1996 China produced 20 000 tonnes of tannins and further processed tannin products, and 22 000 tonnes of tannin extracts. Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials 54In China, over 460 species of fibre plants can be found in the forests. There are more than 40 species of palm and rattan plants in China. The area of natural rattan stands is about 0.3 million ha with annual production of 4 000 to 5 000 tonnes. China is extremely rich in bamboo resources with 17 million ha of bamboo forests and over 500 species of bamboo. The area of bamboo plantations is estimated to be over 7 million ha with a commercial production of 97 million tonnes of bamboo. Annual production of bamboo poles ranges between 6 to 7 million tonnes, accounting for one-third of total world production. In 1992, export of bamboo poles amounted to 90 000 tonnes earning more than US$20 million. The total export value of all processed bamboo products from China in 1993 totaled over US$240 million and US$400 million in 1997. Exudates Resin is among China's most important NWFP. Resin is extracted from Pinus massoniana and P. elliottii ; 1.6 million ha of coniferous forests in China are estimated to be available for resin production. China is the world's largest resin producer with production of 580 000 tonnes and exports of 260 000 tonnes during 1997. The provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi and Fujian are major resin producers accounting for two- thirds of the total production of the country. Until 1997, there were more than 280 small- to medium-sized enterprises for resin production of which 20 had an annual production capacity of more than 5 000 tonnes. An estimated 300 000 people are employed in the resin sector. Yellowhorn ( Xanthoceras sorbifolia ) is an important oil tree species in northeast, north and northwest China. It has been introduced and cultivated in 14 provinces over a total area of about 50 000 ha. The annual production is about 3 750 tonnes (Kunshan 1994). The tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum ) is an important woody oil plant in China, found in 15 provinces. It covers more than 200 000 ha with annual production of about 85 000 tonnes. The oil is extracted from the seeds. Its fat and pulp are important chemical materials which are used widely in soap, wax candles, paint, printing ink, wax paper, skin-protection lotions, metal- painting agents and others. The leaf contains tannin. The leaves and roots are used as medicinals. The bark is a source for tanning extracts and the flower is a nectar source. A small quantity is exported, mainly to Europe and the United States. The tung oil tree (Aleurites fordii ) is one of the major industrial oil tree species in China, occurring in 16 provinces of the south, with a total planted area of about 1.8 million ha and an annual production of 105 000 tonnes in 1989 (Kunshan 1994). The annual export volume is about 20 000 tonnes (Kunshan 1994). Raw lacquer is made from the leaf liquid of the lacquer tree ( Toxicodendron vernicifluum ) and has strong absorptive and anti-corrosive qualities (Kunshan 1994). The lacquer tree is distributed over the provinces of Shaanxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Yunnan and Hunan, covering an area of about 500 000 ha. The annual production of raw lacquer is 2 750 tonnes. Raw lacquer is a traditional export of China. Between 1980 and 1986, the annual exports of raw lacquer averaged 300 tonnes. Japan, Hong Kong, Macao and the United Kingdom are the main importing countries. It earns about US$4 million per year (Kunshan 1994). 55ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS Honey and beeswax The potential for annual honey production in China is estimated at 3 to 4 million tonnes. Other non-edible animal products In China there is a rich variety of insect and animal resources from which industrial materials are prepared (e.g. lacquer insects, wax insects and Chinese gallnut aphids). There are more than 300 species of host plants for lacquer insects. The annual production of lacquer was 1 482 tonnes in 1988 and 3 019 tonnes in 1996. Half of the total production of lacquer is exported to over 45 countries around the world. REFERENCES Agriculture Yearbook of China . 1985-1996. Ed. Ministry of Agriculture, China.

FOREST SERVICES China has made efforts to develop its national parks and forest recreation services; 874 national parks had been established in China by the end of 1997 with an area of 7.48 million ha accounting for 0.75 percent of the total land area. Of the national parks, 292 were established at the national level with an area of 5.37 million ha. Within the nature reserves, 13 forest recreation spots, 2 hunting ranges and 11 forest recreation services have been established. According to China Green Times (1999), from 1992 to 1996 over 300 million people visited the national parks contributing \u00a5180 million, the total income from the tour industry exceeded \u00a51 000 million. In 1997, 52.11 million tourists, of whom 0.68 million came from overseas, visited the national parks; they generated an estimated income of \u00a5819 million and provided job opportunities for nearly 150 000 people. 59QUANTITATIVE NWFP DATA OF CHINA Product Resource Economic value Category Import- ance Trade name Generic term Species Part used Habitat Source Desti- nation Quantity, value Remarks References 1, 2, 3 F, P, O W, C N, I Plants and plant products Food 1 Apple Malus pumila fr P C N, I Annual production of 4.50 million MT Area of 1.69 million ha Zhang Anling 1993 1 Pear Pyrus bretschneideri fr P,O C I, N Annual production of 2.50 million MT Area of 480 000 ha Zhang Anling 1993 2 Orange Citrus reticulata fr P C N Annual production of 4.6 million MT Area of 1 02 million ha Zhang Anling 1993 1 Grape Vitia spp. fr P,O C N Annual production of 870 000 MT Area of 140 000 ha Zhang Anling 1993 2 Banana fr P C N Annual production of 1.40 million MT Area of 110 000 ha Zhang Anling 1993 2 Kiwi fruit Actinidia chinensis fr P,O C N Annual production of 347 000 MT According to Kunshan (1994), annual production is 300 000 MT Area of 670 000 ha Kunshan 1994 2 Bamboo shoot Phyllostachys edulis, N,I Annual production of dry bamboo shoots is 20 000 MT and fresh bamboo shoots is 1.5 million MT Li Yucai 1996 1 Walnut Juglans regia nu P,O C I, N Annual production of 150 000 MT Annual export of 100 000 MT Annual exports: 47 000 MT (US$30-50 million) Area of 1 million ha Zhang Anling, 1993 Kunshan 1994 60 Product Resource Economic value Category Import- ance Trade name Generic term Species Part used Habitat Source Desti- nation Quantity, value Remarks References 1, 2, 3 F, P, O W, C N, I Plants and plant products 1 Chestnut Castanea henryi nu P,O C I, N 378 183 MT in 1997 Area of 300 000 ha Kunshan 1994 China Forestry Yearbook 1995- 97 1 Chinese date Jujube Ziziphus jujuba nu P,O C N, I Annual production of 400 000-500 000 MT Exports of 4 700 MT of dry jujube (US$5 million) p/a Area of 550 000 ha Kunshan 1994. 2 Blackwood ear Auricularia auricula pl F,O C I,N Exports: about 000 (US$8 million) p/a 46 000 MT p/a Jiang Chunqian Whitewood ear Tremella fucifomis pl F,O C I,N Annual production of 1 000 MT Exports: 300 MT p/a Jiang Chunqian 1997; Li Shiitake Lentinus edodes pl F,O C I,N Annual production of 120 000 MT (38.3% of total world production).

General information All usufructs/utility products of plant, animal and mineral origins except timber obtainable from forests or afforested lands are defined as non-timber forest products (NTFP) or non-wood forest products (NWFP) or minor forest products (MFP). Services for tourism and recreation are also considered to be MFP. NWFP in India are derived from over 3 000 species. According to the Centre of Minor Forest Products, 325 species producing NWFP are very common, commercial and have a base in major industry - they are exported or imported; 879 species are used locally; 677 species are potentially useful only locally; and 1 343 species can be described as \"others lesser known\". Nearly 60 percent of all the recorded forest revenue in India comes from NWFP. Most of India's 50 million tribal people receive a substantial proportion of their cash and in-kind income from NWFP (NWFP are estimated to generate 70 percent of all employment in the Indian forestry sector), while about 200 to 300 million village people depend on products from forests to varying degrees (Shiva 1995). The forestry sector, with 23 percent of the country's geographical area, provides 2.3 million person-years of employment. Of this total, 1.6 million person-years are related to NWFP. Most NWFP often provide employment during only part of the year because the processing of NWFP is still poorly developed (Gupta 1994). Commercial NWFP alone are estimated to generate Rs.3 billion (US$100 million) annually. However, NWFP generate some of the lowest wages of the rural employment sector. While the minimum wage in most states ranges from Rs.30 to 40 per day (US$1 to US$1.30), most NWFP collectors earn from Rs.5 to 15 (US$0.25 to US$0.50) per day. Low wages reflect the low productivity of the forest arising from poor management, and depressed prices imposed by state trading monopolies and private buyers (Poffenberger 1994). Most of the NWFP are consumed locally (Shiva 1995). There is no quantitative record of the large numbers of NWFP that are collected by forest inhabitants for their local use and for their subsistence economy. Those commodities, which are exported, generally are stocked in Bombay markets. Data with regard to the quantity of NWFP export are available from the Directorate of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (Calcutta). India exports a large number of NWFP to other countries after meeting internal requirements. Foreign exchange earnings total about Rs.10 billion (US$384 million) annually (Shiva 1995). NWFP are primarily exported as raw materials (Gupta 1994). 66Table 1.

Other important plants producing spices and condiments are (Latin binomials are followed by trade and local Apium thyme) - thyme. Fodder The consumption of fodder was reported to be 229 million tonnes in 1985 (Committee, Government of India). It has been estimated that India needs about 672 million tonnes of fodder to meet its requirements (Jha 1996). Many species have been identified for meeting fodder needs, both in forests and adjoining areas. Overexploitation of forests for fodder may harm other NWFP resources seriously. Medicines India's medicinal plant wealth comprises about 1 500 species. Medicinal plants commonly used in pharmaceutical preparations include: Terminalia chebula, T. plant species are coming under threat increasingly; 15-20 percent of the total vascular flora of India may fall under the IUCN categories of threatened, rare or endangered plants. Due to continuous use, many medicinal plant species have become scarce in the forests and efforts are being made to cultivate them (Gupta 1994). Other important medicinal plants of about 250 commercially important species are (Latin binomials are followed by trade and local terms): Aloe barbadensis Perfumes and cosmetics The important essential oils produced in India come from sandalwood, lemon grass, palmarosa, eucalyptus ( E. globulus and E. citriodora ), khus and linaloe (Gupta 1994). Some commercially important plants that provide essential oils are (Latin binomials are followed by trade and local terms): - eucalyptus citriodora (yields perfumery oil) adrak. Table 6.

Generally, fruit tannins are obtained from chebula Zizyphus xylocarpa are used locally. The main tree species yielding and Carissa spinarum are harvested for tannin production. Around 78 000 to 100 000 tonnes of myrobalan nuts are estimated to be produced annually, valued at Rs15 to 20 million. Over 23 000 tonnes of wattle bark are harvested every year, valued at Rs38 million. About 22 000 tonnes of babul bark are produced annually, valued at Rs55 million. Annual production of avaram bark is estimated at 23 000 tonnes, valued at about Rs35 million (Gupta 1994). 71Some other important plants producing tans and dyes are (Latin binomials are followed by trade sandalwood) - lal chandan. Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials The leaves of Diospyros melanoxylon are used as wrappers for tobacco to produce (tendu, abnus, kendu, tembru, kari, tembhurni and bali tupra). Off-cuts of leaves are burned and the ash is used in toothpowder. Around 300 000 tonnes of bidi leaves are produced annually in India. The value of these leaves is based on an average price of Rs15 000/tonne and the annual value of production is about Rs4 515 million (Gupta 1994). Over 100 species of bamboo occur naturally in India, the most important being Bambusa arundinacea (thorny bamboo or bans), B. tulda are the two principal economic species. Bamboo in India is used mainly for pulp (35 percent of total consumption), housing (20 percent), rural uses (20 percent) and fuel (8.5 percent). It is possible that bamboo areas are declining because of gregarious flowering and the consequent dying of clumps. The price of bamboo varies with its end use. Most of the annual cut is used in making paper or rayon, for which producers receive about Rs300/tonne. The value of the potential annual cut is Rs1 367 million (Gupta 1994). Some other important plants producing bamboos and canes are (Latin binomials are followed by trade and local terms): Arundinaria falcata - tokribet. The following fibre-producing species are used commonly by It is estimated that around 2 500 tonnes per year of agave fibres are produced in the country, with a present value of Rs45 million (Gupta 1994). Flosses are obtained from certain wild fruits. Important species are Bombax ceiba (silk cotton tree or semul) and safed semal). The floss from Bombax ceiba is obtained from capsules and is known as \"Indian kapok.\" The floss is soft and strong and used in life-saving devices for boats, stuffing for cushions, pillows and mattresses, thermal insulation, and soundproof covers and walls. It is a preferred filling material for padded surgical dressings. Flosses obtained from the fruit of Ceiba pentandra (kapok or silk cotton) are elastic and are used in the manufacture of lifebelts and buoys. About 300 tonnes of kapok are produced annually in India, with a value of Rs30 million (Gupta 1994). Other plants producing fibres and flosses are (Latin binomials are followed by trade and local terms): Agave americana (American aloe) and screens (e.g. Saccharum munja, Vetiveria zizanioides and Thysanolaena maxima) (Gupta 1994). Some 0.3 to 0.4 million tonnes of grass could be harvested annually in India (Sharma 1977). Some 60 000 to 80 000 tonnes of sabai grass are purchased each year by paper mills. The price of sabai grass is around Rs300/tonne (Gupta 1994). Exudates Madhya Pradesh has the potential as much gum karaya ( Sterculia urens ) as the rest of India combined. However, tapping in the state was banned in 1982 for 10 years. Approximately 1 400 tonnes of gum karaya are collected annually from other states, valued at about Rs60 million (Gupta 1994). No recent production values are available. Production of gums other than karaya is about 1 900 tonnes, fetching Rs12 million annually. About 46 000 tonnes of oleoresin are obtained from Pinus roxburghii each year, valued at approximately Rs2.8 million (Gupta 1994). Table 7.

Also, it is used widely for medicinal purposes. Two species of bees, Apis dorsata (rock bee) and Apis indica (Indian bee) produce honey. The former is wild in the montane and submontane regions throughout India. It is a good honey gatherer and a single comb may yield up to 35 kg of honey and 1 kg of wax. The latter is amenable to domestication, but it is not a good honey gatherer. The yield per hive ranges from 3 to 13 kg of honey in the hills and 3 to 8 kg in the plains (Gupta 1994). About 250 tonnes of rock bee honey and 98 tonnes of Indian bee honey are produced annually. At a price of Rs40/kg, the total value of honey produced is Rs139 million. Beeswax is used in the manufacture of furniture and floor polishes, dressing and waterproofing of leather goods. It is also an ingredient in shoe polish, cosmetics, lipstick and face cream. About 28 tonnes of wax are produced annually, valued at approximately Rs1.6 million (Gupta 1994). Other non-edible animal products Lac from the insect Laccifer lacca (commonly known as shellac) is used presently for various purposes in plastics, electrical supplies, adhesives, leather, wood finishing, printing, polish and varnish, ink and other industries. It is also the principal ingredient of sealing wax. Two main strains of the lac insect are recognized: rangeeni and kusumi. The rangeeni crop is raised on several host plants, the most important being Butea monosperma and Zizyphus mauritiana on Schleichera oleosa . Both strains produce two crops per year. Lac is collected in two forms, ari and phunki. The former is cut from the host plant and the latter is collected from the brood lac, after being used for inoculation. The lac is then sold as such or freed from the sticks and then sold. The lac removed from the sticks is known commercially as sticklack (Gupta 1994). The annual production of sticklack is about 14 500 to 20 000 tonnes and the price varies from Rs4 500 to 16 000/tonne (most of the produce sells at around Rs14 000/tonne). The total value of the annual production is Rs203 million to Rs280 million (Gupta 1994). India produces four kinds of silk: mulberry, tassar, muga and eri. The silkworm Bombyx mori is fed on mulberry leaves cultivated in plantations. Silkworms are also found wild on forest trees, e.g Antheraea paphia which produces the tassar silk. Antheraea paphia silkworm Philosamia synthia ricini produces eri silk. The estimated annual production of tassar silk is 130 tonnes. Production of other types of silk exceeds 10 000 tonnes (Gupta 1994). Other NWFP of animal origin in India include horns, peacock tails and wings, feathers, waste from the bristles and hair of pigs, hogs and boars. Other NWFP NWFP of mineral origin in India include garnet, granite, limestone, mica, pumice, sandstone (crude or roughly trimmed) and sandstone merely cut by saw and slate. 74REFERENCES Gupta, B.

Other important NWFP are fruits and medicinal plants. General information According to the Forestry Basic Law No. 5 (1967), NWFP are defined as all biomaterial, except wood, taken from the forest. Soenardi (1980) and Suryamiharja and Buharman (1986) have classified NWFP tentatively into two categories, i.e. plant grouping and animal grouping. /circle6 Plant grouping: 1. grouping: animal species, parts of the animal or material produced by animals. 1. Animal: crocodile, monkey, snakes and birds. 2. Parts of animals: crocodile skin, snake skin, biawak ( Varanus sp.) skin deer ( Cervus timorensis horn. 3. Animal products: bird nests, honey, beeswax, silkworm and shellac. At least 90 Indonesian NWFP are being used and traded either by local people or national and international communities. NWFP play an important role as a source of income, employment and as a source of foreign exchange (Soenardi 1980). In general the harvesting of NWFP in Indonesia is free. A license is needed to harvest in Perum Perhutani's (state forest enterprise) forest areas. Harvesting is done by local people as a part of their daily activities. As a labour-intensive industry, the NWFP sector is facing various constraints, i.e. minimal capital investment, a low-skilled labour force, a low technological level used in processing, poor quality control and lack of marketing skills. Indonesian NWFP tend to have lower quality standards and fail in competition with the products from neighbouring countries; only some NWFP are managed properly as a business entity. NWFP resources are being threatened by various activities, e.g. commercial logging, illegal logging, forest land conversion for agriculture and transmigration areas, as well as shifting cultivation. 82 There is no stable management system for NWFP (Soenardi 1980), which results in a general lack of information on NWFP. Many NWFP have not been documented properly and therefore it is difficult to rank their importance. Table 1.

Tengkawang trees start to bear fruit at the age of eight to nine years. Fruiting occurs every four to five years. In international markets these seeds are also known as illipe nuts. Tengkawang seed is produced mainly from Kalimantan (East, North and Central Kalimantan) and South Sumatra. Local people use tengkawang oil for frying and medicines. On the industrial scale, tengkawang oil is used for wax, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, chocolate, soap, margarine and grease making (Suryamiharja and Buharman 1986). Indonesia is the main producer and exporter of tengkawang nuts. Almost all production is exported, mainly to west Europe (the United Kingdom, Netherlands, France, Denmark), Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong (Soewardji and Hutahuruk 1980). Table 2. Export of black and brown tengkawang seeds in 1992 Product Quantity (MT) Value (US$) Price (FOB) (US$/MT) Black illipe 210 105 000 361 7 Pusat Statistik (in Iqbal 1993) Tengkawang export figures for the last five years (from 1993/1994 to 1997/1998) are recorded at 512 tonnes, 3 979 tonnes, 10 648 tonnes, 984 tonnes and 213 tonnes, respectively. The average export of tengkawang every year is about 3 231 tonnes (Biro Perencanaan 1999). Medicines Traditional medicines, locally known as jamu, can be prepared by utilizing dried whole plants or plant organs, locally known as symplicia (in Indonesia, the pharmacological term symplicia refers to unprocessed or dried natural materials that are used for medicinal or health-care purposes) (Hadi 1995). Generally, the collection of medicinal plants is conducted either by specialized collectors who know the plants exactly or herbalists in rural areas who sometimes grow them in their gardens (Menon 1989). 83 Sidik (1994) identified several jamu characteristics: (i) It relates closely with local society and culture; (ii) it has no a standard for material, formulation, processing and quality control; (iii) it uses plants grown locally; and (iv) it is utilized through touch and sensory perception. Some scientists are trying to collect and record all of Indonesia's medicinal plants (e.g. Zuhud 1994). Menon (1989) has recorded several plants used for both Indonesian traditional and western medicines such as Ephedra of plants used in Indonesian traditional medicine are patchouly oil is exported to several countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, France and Taiwan. In 1991/1992, the export value reached Rp.1.06 billion (US$530 000) (Directorate General of Food and Drug Administration 1992; Hadi 1995). The industry faces strong market competition with herbal medicines imported from China. Table 3.

The expansion of jamu industries that produce well- packed, powdered traditional medicines, accompanied by intensive advertising, has resulted in a wider consumption. Traditional medicinal plants are consumed by a wide range of communities (Hadi 1995). Cayeput oil (locally known as kayu putih) has been appreciated for a long time and it is used widely as medicine for various illnesses (Menon 1989). It is produced by extracting the leaves of the gelam or kayu liquid, which vapourizes at room temperature. Kayu putih trees grow naturally and Nusa Tenggara, particularly in Pulau Buru, Seram and Timor. These trees are also planted in West Java, Yogyakarta, Central Java and East Java. Leaf collection is conducted throughout the year by cutting branches and twigs that are more than six months old (Suryamiharja and Buharman 1986). Cayeput oil competes against other essential oils (such as eucalyptus oil) in the market. All cayeput oil production is traded by Perum Perhutani. Table 4.

The trees grow naturally in Belu, Timor, North Central Timor, South Central Timor, Kupang, West Sumba and East Sumba (Sarong 2001). The most important species for the production of sandalwood oil is Santalum album (Menon 1989). Exploitation of sandalwood is carried out under local regulation. The chief of the village and his staff have the authority to issue the harvesting permit. When trees are scarce, smaller trees are also extracted. Sandalwood in the eastern part of Flores disappeared a long time ago because of continuous cutting and insufficient effort to maintain its sustainability. People often cut the wood illegally, stole and smuggled it because of its high price (Rp.5 000 to Rp.100 000/kg). A recent local regulation (No 2/1998) states that sandalwood growing naturally in the forests belongs to the government and sandalwood planted by farmers belongs to the farmers (Sarong 2001). Two sandalwood oil factories were established in Kupang in 1972 and 1974. Both factories have a processing capacity of 1 000 tonnes of wood per year. More than 90 percent of the sandalwood produced in North Timor was sold to the two factories and the remaining wood was processed in the carving industry (Menon 1989). Table 6.

The United States is the largest importer of sandalwood oil (an annual average of 25-30 tonnes). Western Europe is also a significant importer and there are substantial markets in Asia (Iqbal 1993). Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials Thirty-five bamboo species are found on almost every island of Indonesia. Dominant bamboo species include there are 50 000 ha of bamboo plantations in East Java and South Sulawesi, the bulk of bamboo comes from the rural areas. In 1989, the value of bamboo exports 85 reached US$1.2 million. Most bamboo products are consumed in domestic markets. In 1985, the consumption of bamboo totalled 146 million stalks (Silitonga et al. 1990; Silitonga 1994). Rattan is considered to be the most important NWFP in Indonesia. In 1986, the Government of Indonesia issued an export ban on raw rattan exports in order to increase the added value of rattan. The ban was overruled in 1997 as one of the commitments between the Government of Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Rattan is harvested manually by local people. Rattan can be harvested year-round and therefore it can become the main plant for a household in terms of cash flow produced (Purnama and Prahasto 1996). Rattan grows unevenly in clusters and every cluster produces around 20 to 25 kg of cane a year with different harvesting schedules. The harvesting cycle for rattan is generally three to five years for each cluster. Rattan with a bigger diameter (more than 17 mm) can be found in the western part of Indonesia (Sumatra and Kalimantan); the smaller diameter is grown in the eastern part of Indonesia (Suryamiharja and Buharman 1986) .

Inconsistencies arise when comparing the data of rattan export volume with the data of national rattan production. A rattan inventory was conducted by the Ministry of Forestry in 1995. The survey indicated that 1.2 million ha of forests are rich in rattan and estimated rattan production to be at 415 tonnes per year (Soekardi 2000). Table 8.

The policies depressed the domestic prices of rattan, which in turn contributed an adverse impact on the income of rattan farmers and collectors. This depressed price was also considered to be a disincentive for rattan farmers or collectors (forest dwellers) to cultivate rattan in a sustainable manner. The price of rattan at the farm gate in 1981 was Rp.1 800/kg (US$1.01). In comparison, the rattan price in 1986 was Rp.1 600/kg (US$0.9) and then it declined to Rp.740/kg (US$ 0.4). The price of rattan in 1999 was the lowest (Rp. 450/kg or US$0.2) (Saragih 2000). 86 The rattan export ban of raw cane had a negative effect on the rattan price at the farm gate. The main reason was the inefficiency of the Indonesian rattan-processing industry. Hence, the industry had to depress domestic prices of rattan in order to compete with China's rattan industry, which has lower prices and better quality rattan products on international markets. Exudates Over 20 different resins and gums were exported from Indonesia in 1989 (Central Bureau of Statistics 1990). Resin from pine, jelutung, frankincense and Arabic gums topped the list. Exports of resinous and gum products in 1989, totalled 40 688 tonnes, valued at US$22 million rosin, colophony or kucing) is produced through tapping of the resin of Pinus merkusii , which grows in Sumatra, Java and Bali (Suryamiharja and Buharman 1986). Pinus trees may produce up to 500 kg of resin per hectare. Processed resin yields gondorukem (with a recovery rate of 60 percent) and turpentine oil (a recovery rate of 17 percent). In 1983, natural and planted pine forests covered 747 000 ha in Indonesia. Some 600 000 ha are grown in Java alone. Since 1983, the pine forests have been expanded at a rate of 15 000 ha per year. The pine stands in Java according to Silitonga (1994) provided work for at least 70 000 people. There are several classes of gondorukem that are used for different products. The darkest classes of gondorukem (B, C and D) are used for making rosin oil, linoleum and dark varnish. The G and K classes are used as sizing material in soap making. Different quality of soap will use different classes of gondorukem. For instance, good quality soap will use pale gondorukem (W-C and W-W). Gondorukem can also be used as sealing wax, in explosive materials, varnishing of music strings, for paint making, printing ink, wood polish mixture, fireworks, waterproof material for thicker paper and for plastics (Suryamiharja and Buharman 1986).

Jelutung is the local name latex tree which grows Central Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, Aceh, North Sumatra, Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra and Central Java (Soenardi 1980). The Jelutung gum is traded as jelutung or pontianak (in the past known also as Dead Borneo). There are three types of Jelutung gum traded in Indonesia, namely; (i) is the best quality of jelutung. The trunk of the jelutung tree contains gum that is used to produce bubblegum and as raw material for handicrafts. Other uses of the Jelutung gum are insulation material for cable and electric wire, dental material and as a waterproofing agent (Suryamiharja and Buharman 1986). Tapping is performed by local people as a part-time job especially when the price of jelutung gum increases (Soetanto 1980). The tapping of 10 to 20 trees can be completed in six working hours and produces 100-200 kg of jelutung gum. Usually, jelutung gum is exported to Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong. The export figures of jelutung gum for the last five years (from 1993 to 1998) were recorded at 1 192 tonnes, 585 tonnes, 301 tonnes, 2 142 tonnes and 2 785 tonnes, respectively. The average export of jelutung gum every year is about 1 401 tonnes (Biro Perencanaan 1999). Damar is a gum in Lampung, South Sumatra, Aceh, West Sumatra, Riau, North Sumatra, West Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Maluku. Other Damar collection is similar to the tapping of jelutung gum and is done by local people as a part- time job. Damar has been used widely as a raw material in the manufacture of rubber, paint, wax, varnish, plastic, matches, insulation material, painting and printing products, medicines and explosives. Table 11.

The resin of the tree is called kemenyan resin (benzoin resin); locally it is called kemenyan (incense). North Tapanuli in North Sumatra Province is well known as the production centre for kemenyan resin in Indonesia. The two kinds of kemenyan known by local farmers in North preferred because of its better quality and price in local markets (Anonymous 2000). The total area of kemenyan in North Tapanuli was 22 670 ha in 2000 with production of 2 000 to 3 000 tonnes per year. This figure was lower than the figure in 1990 when the total area of 22 793 ha produced 4 000 to 5 000 tonnes per year. Kemenyan planted on community land as a heritage, is now dominated by old trees (more than 20 years old). Traditionally the kemenyan business is run by local farmers. The harvesting of resin is done conventionally by tapping the tree once a year. Production of kemenyan has been declining because of the inadequate trading system and unstable prices. The price of kemenyan varies between Rp.25 000 to Rp.50 000/kg and the price at the farm gate is around Rp.5 000 to Rp.12 000/kg. On international markets, kemenyan from Indonesia is sold for US$4/kg (Anonymous 2000). Kemenyan resin from Sumatra contains 30 to 35 percent of balsamic acids. Kemenyan is marketed in Java and exported to Singapore and Malaysia. There are five classes for the quality of kemenyan traded on domestic markets. Agarwood, aloewood, eaglewood and gaharu are all names for the resinous, fragrant and extremely valuable heartwood produced by the family Thymeleaceae. Gaharu is the Bahasa Indonesia/Malay term for agarwood (Zich and Compton 2001). Gaharu is a piece of wood or root that has been modified chemically by a fungi-type infection. There are eight tree species producing gaharu in Indonesia, all coming from the family of Thymeleaceae. They derive from the genera Aetoxylon (1 species), Aquilaria (2 species), Enkleia (1 species), Gonystylus (2 species) and Wikstroemia (2 species) (Sidiyasa [1986] in and Suripatty [1996]). In West Kalimantan, Sukendar (1988) found that the angkaras tree (Aquilaria malaccensis Lak) is another tree species that produces gaharu. In East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) two trees species that produce gaharu have been identified, i.e. cue or Thymeleaceae family (Universitas Nusa Cendana-UNC 1996). In Irian Jaya, two species of in 1996). Gaharu collection is done by local people in groups, each group consisting of three to five people. The group spends three to seven days looking for gaharu in the forest. When gaharu is found in a particular tree, the tree will be cut manually using axes or knives. One tree usually produces about 0.5 to 4 kg of gaharu (UNC 1996). The current estimates indicate that the total number of Aquilaria trees harvested in a given year in Indonesia varies from 30 000 to 100 000 trees (Soehartano and Newton 2001). Table 12.

Gaharu contributed up to Rp.6.2 billion to foreign exchange earnings in 1995. The present price of gaharu is about Rp.2.3 million/kg for the super class (Kompas 2001). Due to intensive exploitation, gaharu has been included in Appendix II of the Convention of International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) since 1994 and therefore the harvesting of gaharu and its exports should be limited (see also Soehartano and Newton 2001). However, gaharu cultivation in Indonesia is being developed by the Biotechnology Laboratory of Agriculture Faculty, University of Mataram (Kompas 2001). Kopal is the gum collected from trees of the Araucariaceae family, such as Agathis philippinensis and Buharman 1986). The regions that produce kopal in Indonesia are Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku, Irian Jaya and Java. Before World War II, the average production of kopal was 11 000-12 000 tonnes each year. This represented about 80 percent of the world's kopal production and Irian Jaya was the biggest producer. After World War II, kopal production in Indonesia declined to 2 000-4 000 tonnes per year and Sulawesi became the biggest producer (Soenardi 1980). The export figures of kopal for the last four years (from 1993 to 1997) were recorded at 1 886 tonnes, 2 063 tonnes, 1 168 tonnes and 1 600 tonnes, respectively (Biro Perencanaan 1999). Of these numbers, the total volume of kopal traded by Perum Perhutani is about 542 tonnes. Table 13.

Domestically, kopal is used as a raw material for the production of paint and varnish. Kopal is also used for enamel making, glue, plastic and other uses such as coating material for textiles, printing inks and adhesives (Suryamiharja and Buharman 1986). ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS Wildlife and wildlife-derived products 90 From 1981 to 1989, wildlife and wildlife-product exports from Indonesia increased from US$2.4 million to US$36.4 million. Average earnings from unprotected wildlife sales from Indonesia amounted to US$11million per year. Breeding centres for monkeys, snakes, crocodiles, turtles, snails and other species are also found in Indonesia (Silitonga 1994). Most of the trade in wildlife does not adhere to the CITES regulations (Silitonga 1994). Honey and beeswax Honey, locally known as madu, and beeswax are produced from the dwarf bee ( Apis florea ), the giant or rock bee ( dorsata ), the oriental bee ( Apis cerana common honey bee ( Apis mellifera ) (Menon 1989). The region in Indonesia that produces the best quality of honey is Sumbawa, thus it is known as madu sumbawa. No figures are available regarding the production of beeswax. Table 14.

The honey that bees provide is a valuable food that may be sold and consumed at home and beeswax can be used also at home and for industry (Menon 1989). The products of commercially managed beekeeping can be classified based on the source flower, i.e. honey from the flowers of kapuk on beekeeping conducted by Menon (1989) stated that a minimum of 30 colonies of Apis melifera is required, the cost of a colony being around Rp.200 000, for a business to be profitable. Each colony will then produce 40 kg of honey per annum, valued from Rp.6 000 to Rp.10 000/kg and a profit can be gained of up to 300 percent of the investment. This profit can increase remarkably when it also produces royal jelly at the same time, for which the price per kilogramme was around Rp.122 500 (US$70) during the time of the analysis. The price of honey from different flower sources has different prices. The highest price is for honey coming from durian, cengkeh and kaliandra flowers.

Visitors who visited conservation areas exceeded 3 million during the same year. In 1985, 4.4 million tourists entered wildlife sanctuaries, paying the government Rp.17.7 million in entrance fees (Silitonga 1994). Priasukmana (1999) stated that ecotourism should be prioritized in the national forestry programme because tourism is well known as a green and smokeless industry. Manan (1998) pointed out that forest tourism has physical, mental and spiritual impacts on human life, through such activities as: hunting, fishing, walking, horse riding, picnicking, camping, hiking, boating, swimming and other hobbies (photography, painting, handicrafts and nature watching). Therefore he suggested that the forests located in Java and Sumatra should be used not only for timber production, but also as recreation sources for the local communities. This will be the main task for foresters, ecologists, sociologists and landscape architects in establishing natural recreation and forest tourism. Most of people who live in big cities enjoy outdoor recreation. Many suitable places for recreation (hills, lakes, rivers, beaches and small islands) are distributed widely in Indonesia. These can be scenic spots, natural monuments, wildlife sanctuaries or historical, geological, archeological and biological sites. Table 16.

Other important NWFP are spices, stems (bamboo, rattan), perfumes, cosmetics (incense) and orchids. General information Lao PDR has a high dependency on forest products due to its low population density combined with a high rate of forest cover (Foppes and Ketphanh 2000). NWFP serve a wide range of subsistence needs and provide opportunities for earning cash income. More than 500 plant and animal products are reported to be used. However, many species have yet to be identified botanically and the names of many species are still inconsistent in different reports. Furthermore, no systematic survey has been conducted on flora. From rural surveys, villagers identified over 757 species of plants and 150 species of animals that are used. NWFP make a significant contribution to the national economy both directly and indirectly. At the national level, NWFP provide roughly 2.5 percent of annual exports (Ingles et al. 1998). According to Foppes and Ketphanh (2000), NWFP provide 50 to 55 percent of the cash income of rural villages, where 80 percent of the population lives and their subsistence use may account for 20 to 30 percent of the gross national product. The reported export value of NWFP was about US$6.3 million in 1993. Among all the exported products, medicinal plants score highest with about 70 percent of the total export value, followed by fibre products at 15 percent, resin 8 percent, edible products 6 percent and incense 2 percent. Most NWFP are exported to China, especially medicinal plants (Ingles et al. 1998), Viet Nam and Thailand although certain products are also exported to Japan and Europe. Both animal and plant products are culturally, socially and economically important for Laotians. Everyone can collect NWFP from both plant and animal sources for local use. Through the Land Use Planning and Land Allocation Scheme, some forms of ownership along with community rules on the management and use of resources within the village boundary have been developed. In commercial collection, a quota from the Department of Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for the harvesting of NWFP is needed. 99 Table 1.

Efforts at domestication are now expanding to cover more species (e.g. Styrax grass, rattan shoots, bamboo shoots and culms and paper mulberry are collected from small-scale plantations, agroforests and home gardens. In addition to forest product gathering in large blocks of state-owned and open-access forests, other types of forest use and management with regard to NWFP are described by Foppes and Ketphanh (2000): /circle6 Traditional ownership rights over specific types of trees: Markings of trees as a symbol of ownership (e.g. Dipterocarpus spp. for resin tapping and beehives on trees). /circle6 Spirit forests and hunting taboos: Small forests honoured as burial grounds or as a refuge for spirits. /circle6 Village agreements on forest-use rules: E.g. a fishing and hunting ban during certain seasons between different user groups and sustainable harvesting agreements through improvement activities. /circle6 Multi-village agreements on forest-use rules : E.g. the National Bio-diversity Conservation Areas (NBCA), State production forests, protection forests or even in village forests (designated through the land-use and land allocation scheme). /circle6 Community aquatic resource management: The establishment of fish conservation zones including the declaration of certain portions of the natural streams/rivers as conservation zones where no fishing or any activity causing disturbance is allowed during the period of peak fishing pressure in the dry season. Other typical management options: bans on stream blocking; bans on various destructive fishing/collection methods; fish fry conservation; frog conservation schemes; regulations for fishing in paddy fields and communal lakes, etc. Fish conservation provides an excellent entry point for integrated development and conservation programmes. Prominent examples are in the south of Lao PDR where over 60 village communities in one district have set successful co-management systems for fish and frog conservation over the last eight years. 102 PLANTS AND PLANT PRODUCTS Food Main products for local use include several species used as food. More than 50 plant species have been recorded as wild vegetables. Many species are available throughout the year. Tubers ( Dioscorea spp.) are important substitutes for rice and important ingredients for preparing local desserts. Mushrooms are also very popular. According to Foppes and Ketphanh (1997) some of the common bamboo species sell for US$0.15 to 0.50/kg, depending on the season, and the value of two kilogrammes of bamboo shoots is roughly equal to one kilogramme of rice (Ketphanh 1995). The two most common rattan species that are eaten for their shoots are Calamus tenuis and Daemonorops schmidtiana (Foppes and Ketphanh 1997) . The fruit and shoots of all these species are edible and some of them are sold on the local market (US$0.17 for three shoots) (Ketphanh 1995). Malva nuts (makjong) are fruits collected from Scaphium macropodum (sometimes reported to be collected also from Scaphium lychnophorum and Sterculia lychnophora ). The species show a certain degree of endemism and are found only in pockets in the semi-evergreen forests in southern provinces of the country namely, Champasack, Salavan, Sekong and Attapeu. Flowering and fruiting take place irregularly once in every three to four years (Flint 2000). The gel made from malva nuts is edible and locally malva nuts are used as ingredients in dishes and beverages. Malva nut has cooling agent medicinal properties. It is used to treat dysentry, intestinal infections, coughing and sore throats (Lamxay 2001). Malva nuts have a fairly limited market locally and they have gained commercial export value only recently. The most significant years for harvesting and trade of malva nuts have been 1995, 1998 and 2001. The main export market is China. The fruit is sold to middlemen at US$1.00 to 2.00/kg. With the attractive price of this product, initiatives have been made recently to try out nursery techniques and trial plantations have been started in Champasack Province. Sugar palm is the fruit of Arenga westerhoutii. Sugar palm is distributed naturally in northern provinces such as Luang Nam Tha, Oudomxai, Luang Prabang and Sayabouly. Harvesting of sugar palm fruits is done usually from January to March. The mature fruits are harvested mainly by climbing trees and cutting down fruit clusters or in some cases by felling the sugar palm tree. According to Lamxay (2001) the yield productivity of sugar palm fruits is approximately 200 to 300 kg/tree in an area with a density of about 120 trees/ha. One tree can produce up to 200 litres of sugar palm juice. Approximately 10 kg of fresh fruits can produce 3 to 3.5 kg of endosperm (seeds). The sugar palm tree has numerous uses: the shoots can be cooked in a variety of local soups; leaves are used as roofing material; the seeds of the fruit are edible and are used commonly in desserts. Besides, the juice can be harvested from the apex of male flowers to be processed as hard sugar. Currently, sugar palm fruits are sold to a canning factory in Vientiane before being sold to domestic and international markets. The main export market for sugar palm seeds/endosperm has been Thailand. The exported quantity has been about 600 tonnes/year (on average US$0.33 to 0.54/kg). 103 cardamom [Ketphanh 1995]) grows abundantly in disturbed natural forests on semishaded sites in all parts of the country. Eight species of cardamom occur throughout the country (Lamxay 2001), the four main being Amomum longiligular, Amomum naeng hua lohn ). The first species is the most popular in the south and the others in the north. The cardamom fruit is collected mainly from natural forests. Cardamom has been domesticated in home gardens, and is grown with rice in shifting cultivation fields in many areas, notably in parts of Champasack Province where planting started in 1975 (Lamxay 2001) and in Salavan Province. Two native species i.e. Amomum villosum ( red cardamom ) are used in planting. One exotic species from China, Amomum xanthioides was also introduced in Oudomxay Province because of its high price. Harvesting in plantations starts from the fourth year. The yield of cardamom varies from 300 to 600 kg/ha (Lamxay 2001). Cardamom fruits are collected every year from September to October. The harvesting season lasts for 15 to 30 days. Cardamom is used chiefly for medicinal purposes. The product is collected exclusively for export to China and Korea at varying prices. Among medicinal products, which cover about 70 percent of the total export income, cardamom accounts for 90 percent (Ingles et al. 1998). The quantity of exported cardamom has been increasing annually since 1995 . According to Ketphanh (1995) cardamom is used as a spice. In the Middle East it is used to flavour coffee; in northern Europe and the United States in bakery products; and elsewhere it is used in meat seasoning. Ketphanh (1995) reports that the price for seeds in rural areas is about US$1.00 to 2.50/kg. Cardamom seeds are exported primarily to Thailand and China and the export price is about US$3.00/kg. Perfumes and cosmetics Sapan or peuak meuak, a climber species ( Boemeria malabarica ), is Luang Prabang, Sayabouly, Luang Nam Tha, Bokeo, Xiang Khouang and Phongsaly. Bark harvesting has been conducted mainly from the natural forests and has often been very destructive. Actual harvesting practices included extracting the whole plant, including roots. The bark is then removed, cut into sections and sun-dried for almost one week until the moisture content is about 12 to 15 percent. The sun-dried bark is then broken into small pieces to facilitate packing and transporting. Storing in dry, well-ventilated conditions is essential to avoid fungus attacks. Local villagers report using sapan in traditional medicines for treating digestive and intestinal disorders. There is no processing of the final product in Lao PDR. The dried bark is exported mainly to China where it is used to produce incense, mosquito repellent and glue. Little trade or pricing information is available from local trading agencies that deal with foreign companies. Luang Nam Tha and Bokeo provinces export the largest quantities. Local villagers have started to plant the species and research to domesticate it is currently ongoing. Future prospects are expected to be good although there will be a decrease of the resource in the natural forests. 104 Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials Paper mulberry ( Broussonetia papyrifera ) is a well-known species that produces a strong fibre from its bark. The species is distributed naturally throughout the country. Paper mulberry has numerous uses: traditional medicine (fruits, sap, leaves bark and roots); as fodder for livestock, pigs, poultry and fish (leaves); soap and waxes (sap from seeds); firewood; (debarked stems) (Lamxay 2001; Forsen et al. 2001). The ash from burned stems is used for bleaching pulp by villagers in Luang Prabang in hand-made paper making, and wastewater from this process is later used as fertilizer. Locally the bark of paper mulberry is used mainly for producing pulp for export. Currently several small private enterprises are dealing with the production of mulberry pulp, hand- made paper and handicraft items. Farmers sell the dry bark (both quality graded and not graded) to collectors in the village. One collector buys around 500 kg of dry bark per year from the farmers and sells to the district collector who again transports it to a provincial trader. The provincial trader does the grading of the bark and sells it to the Thai traders at the border; later they sell it to the business- houses that buy various cash crops for subsequent retail to the factories in Thailand. The harvester's price varies seasonally. On average the price at the farm gate was about US$0.30/kg of dry bark in 1999 and US$0.23/kg in 2000 (Forsen et al. 2001). Official figures show that from 1995 to 1999 Lao PDR exported about 146 tonnes of dry bark per year (Lamxay 2001). The export prices for dry bark vary with grades. Grade A is sold for US$0.92/kg and grade B for US$0.85 at the factory in Thailand (Forsen et al. 2001). Grade C is sold generally to local paper makers and grade D is a special grade sold at the highest rate. Forsen et al. (2001) revealed that the mulberry paper factory in Luang Prabang Province (presently the only one in operation in the country) produces about 440 tonnes of pulp per year. Out of this total production, 80 percent is exported to Thailand, 10 percent to South Korea and 10 percent to China. Hand-made paper products are produced by several small enterprises and mainly are sold locally. Paper mulberry bark is collected from natural stands, plantations and intercropping systems (Forsen et al. 2001). Collection from natural forests is declining in favour of more management-oriented systems because of resource depletion in the wild and increased prices and numbers of harvesters. Intercropping production systems appear to be more popular compared to monocrop plantations. Two intercropping subsystems are practised: intercropping paper mulberry with annual crops and using paper mulberry as a transition crop to fruit orchards or tree plantations. The amount of bark collected from natural stands is expected to decrease and paper mulberry gardens are expected to expand (Forsen et al. 2001). The lack of labour seems to be an important limiting factor for mulberry plantations. The yields of paper mulberry bark vary greatly. The preferred spacings are 1.5 x 1.5 m (5 067 kg of dry bark/ha) and 2 x 2m (5 440 kg of dry bark/ha) as they give a fairly high yield, good quality bark and trees that are easy to harvest (Forsen et al. 2001). The scientific name as well as the local name of the species yielding bong bark is not clear and there is an ongoing study to identify the species. Two species of bong have been identified to yield bark with a commercial value. These two species are named locally after the colour of the sap, as bong daeng (red is found throughout the country both in lowland and mountainous areas. Bong bark is used in the production of incense/joss sticks, used commonly in Buddhist temples throughout Southeast Asia. Bong bark is also used to make mosquito repellent coils/incense, as glue in carton or particle-board production and timber lacquer. In old traditional practices, bong bark was mixed with soil when used for modelling and moulding to make statues in temples and in household items. The bong bark is harvested from December to April from six-(or more)year-old trees. Local harvesting methods involve stripping sections of the bark. Stripping all the bark causes tree mortality, but coppices regrow readily from stumps. 105 Dried bong bark is exported mainly to Viet Nam and Thailand. From 1995 to 1999 an average of 325 tonnes per year were exported, valued at US$93 578.00 (US$0.26 to 0.50/kg). The marketing prospects for bong bark are expected to remain stable as incense sticks are used daily in Buddhist ceremonies, in temples and households throughout Southeast Asia. There is a continuous demand as more sticks are used as people become wealthier. Tiger grass (broom grass) (Thysanolaena latifolia or T. maxima ) is found in all regions although it is more dominant in the northern provinces. Collection is almost entirely from the wild, although a small quantity is also collected from plantations. The collected flowers are sun-dried and fruits are removed before selling. The dried panicle can be stored for many years. The tiger grass stems/flowers are used to make brooms. Some people eat the young shoots. Leaves are harvested as fodder for livestock. Tiger grass is sold mainly on local markets (US$0.25 to 0.6/kg). Dry unprocessed flowers are also exported to Thailand. The NTFP Project surveys on marketing information reveal that from 1995 to 1999, Lao PDR exported an average of 320 tonnes per year, at the price of US$0.26 to 0.42/kg. Some studies have been conducted recently to support villagers' efforts to domesticate the species. Bamboo culms and rattan canes are used widely for fencing, house construction, fishing equipment, basketry, tools and implements and furniture. The most commonly used bamboo species for these purposes are Cephalostachyum virgatum, are the species used most commonly. Rattan grows primarily in the central part of the country (Ketphanh 1995). Each year, the government issues cutting permits for up to 400 000 pieces of large-dimension rattan (one piece measures 4.5 m in length). Actual production varies from 300 000 to 400 000 pieces of large diameter rattan, and from 25 000 to 30 000 tonnes of small diameter rattan, all coming from wild plants. Large diameter rattan is supplied mainly to four large factories, with smaller volumes being directed to home production of furniture and handicrafts. Among the products made from rattan are furniture, baskets, fish traps, hats, walking sticks, tool handles, ropes and mats. Only processed rattan products can be exported (Ketphanh 1995). Rural people earn income from the harvest of rattan either by retail to traders or to representatives from the main factories. Collectors earn about US$0.60 per piece of large rattan in the rural areas. Cane delivered to factory sites earns about US$1.00 per piece. Small diameter rattan is sold for US$0.35/kg. Cottage industries employ both men and women (Ketphanh 1995). In Vientiane, the total use of bamboo culms is about 1 000 000 culms per year. The price of one culm (5 m) is US$0.20 to 0.40. Importation of bamboo mat board from Viet Nam averages 80 000 sheets per year according to interviews with traders. The price is US$2.00 per 1.6 x 4.0 m mat. Many bamboo products (handicrafts, furniture, raw materials) are exported, but quantities are still relatively small and no accurate data on quantities or values are available (Ketphanh 1995). Handicrafts made from bamboo are an important source of income for farmers, following the rice-growing season. In Vientiane, factories processing bamboo provide work for about 1 500 people (Ketphanh 1995). Exudates Damar resin (also called damar oil and yang oil by Ketphanh [1995], locally known as khii sii) is a plant exudate obtained from tree species of the family Dipterocarpaceae that mainly occurs in the dry dipterocarp and evergreen forests in the central and southern parts of the country. The species that produce damar resin are by Shorea obtusa is the best in quality. Rural people use damar resin to make a lacquer or sealer for local bamboo woven buckets and as a coating to waterproof buckets and local wooden boats. The resin is used in the paint industry, in ink production and for varnishes and lacquers. The resin is collected both from the ground around the tree and on the tree. According Lamxay (2001) each tree with a diameter of more than 30 cm can produce an average of 15 to 20 kg of damar resin. The collection is done by the villagers, who sell the resin to the collectors or middlemen representing the export companies. Damar resin is exported as raw material mainly to Thailand. The export quantity has increased rapidly over the last few years but the price, however, has decreased every year. Most of the resin used locally is collected directly by the users. Styrax (benzoin) ( Styrax tonkinensis ) produces an excellent gum called benzoin or gum benjamin . To obtain the gum, trees are scarred or wounded. In an effort to close the wound, new wood forms. This new wood contains cavities filled with a resinous secretion (raw benzoin) (Ketphanh 1995). Wild styrax grows on fallow land where people practise shifting cultivation. Traditionally people never planted the styrax trees, allowing wild styrax trees to grow unhindered. Trials on plantations have not been successful (Ketphanh 1995). Since the 1980s the production of benzoin has declined because raw materials are poor in quality and producers lack marketing mechanisms. In 1994, the price of benzoin was US$2.00 to 2.50/kg and no processing of raw benzoin was done (Ketphanh 1995). ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS Honey and beeswax Nests of honey bees are found in all forest types. The estimated production of honey is about 5 to 10 tonnes per year. Bee management and beekeeping are still not developed in Lao PDR, but if developed, they could provide a sustainable, long-term means of exploiting the available flora. Honey is collected for household use as a food, as a sweetener and for the production of medicine. Wax is used for polishes, cosmetics and candle making (Ketphanh 1995). In local markets, honey and wax can be sold quite easily, but export is difficult because the volume of production (10 tonnes per year) is small and producers lack information on quality improvement and marketing. The price paid to collectors is about US$0.80 to 1.00/litre, but in town markets, the price is about US$2.00/litre. Solidified wax is sold in local markets for US$4.00 to 5.00/kg (Ketphanh 1995). Bushmeat Several species of fish, frogs, shrimps, soft-shelled fresh water turtles, crabs, and other water animals are probably the most important sources of protein in most areas of Lao PDR. Wildlife is also an important source of protein in most rural areas. Over 1 400 species of wild animals have been identified and about 90 percent probably are used by local people (IUCN 2001). Some 31 mammal species, 24 bird species and 13 reptile species were recorded as being eaten (Foppes and Ketphanh 1997). 107 No official permit is issued for hunting and people hunt unprotected species. The species under the controlled category can also be hunted during the non-breeding season but only for food and not for sale. However, most animal species have been hunted heavily for subsistence use and local sale. Not only unprotected species, but a number of protected wildlife species like pangolins and several other animals are suffering from heavy illegal hunting.

Other NWFP include palm, resin, tannin, ferns, barks, vegetables and wood-oil. General information In Malaysia, minor forest products are defined as all forest products other than logs because of their relatively small contribution to revenue generation. The term \"minor forest product\" has been replaced recently by the term NWFP recognizing the market and non-market values of these products. NWFP include rattan, bamboo, firewood, charcoal, damar, palm, wood-oil, gums, resins, medicinal plants and others (Poh Lye Yong 1994). No inventories to quantify non-wood forest resources have been done except for the National Forest Inventory by Forestry Department Peninsular Malaysia (every 10 years) (Abdul Razak Mohd. Ali and Abd. Latif Mohmod 1998). PLANTS AND PLANT PRODUCTS Food Wild vegetables are common food for rural people. The consumption of the young fronds of Diplazilon escidentitin and Stenochlaena palustris is very popular in most indigenous communities in Sarawak and both vegetables are sold commonly in the urban markets (Burgers 1993; DoA 1992). Also Etlingera elatior and E. punicea (Zingiberaccae) are consumed in both rural and urban communities of Sarawak, but in smaller quantities. Coinnielina paludosa and Rungia sp. are popular among certain sections of the rural population. The peeled stem tips of the young shoots are eaten. R. borneense and Rungia sp. occur relatively rarely, but the soft leaves are valued highly by isolated rural communities. The cultivation of this species is feasible and often for farmers with subsistence-oriented production systems it is a more attractive option than planting annual exotic vegetables (Metz 1998). Table 1. Major fruit species in Malaysia Group 1: Non-seasonal fruits, potential for export market Bananas ( Musa melo L.) Group 2: Seasonal fruits, potential for local consumption or export market Mango ( Mangifera Citrus spp.) Group 3: Popular fruits which have not been exploited for commercial cultivation and export (1998) According to Metz (1998) there is considerable potential for wild vegetables to contribute to the intensification of shifting cultivation systems, particularly in Sarawak and Southeast Asia in general if appropriate cropping practices are developed using existing farming techniques. Malaysia has a rich diversity of fruit trees, many of which are indigenous and endemic to the country. It has been estimated that about 500 species of fruit trees are found in Malaysia's rain forests of which about 100 are considered edible. Only some 60 species are cultivated and utilized. Sixteen species belong to major fruits (Rukayah Aman 1998). Additionally, Rukayah Aman (1998) has presented 61 rare and wild edible fruits in Peninsular Malaysia and their potential uses. Medicines About 1 200 of the higher plants in Malaysian forests are reported to have medicinal properties. Currently only about 200 are used in preparing various traditional medicines, but plant-based products such as herbal medicines and health foods are gaining more popularity among Malaysians. Based on data obtained from 4 000 Chinese herbal stores, the annual sales value in Malaysia was about $M500 million in 1994 and the estimated market value of traditional medicine was between $M1 to 2 billion in 1995 (Azizol Abdul Kadir and Rasadah Mat Ali 1998). Many aromatic plant species in local rain forests have potential use for the production of essential oils, turpentine, flavours and fragrances. Although many aromatic and medicinal plant resources are available locally for industry, the supply of materials continues to come mainly from China, India and Indonesia, with only a small amount being harvested from Malaysian forests (Azizol Abdul Kadir and Rasadah Mat Ali 1998). Table 2. Commonly used medicinal and aromatic plants in Malaysia Latin binomial Local name Common use Eurycoma longifolia tongkat Ali herbal preparation Source: Azizol Abdul Kadir and Rasadah Mat Ali (1998) Medicinal plant species are collected from their natural habitats. Thus the supply of these materials is very uncertain, with product quality being variable. Some examples of common medicinal plant species used as major ingredients in local herbal products champaca and Cananga odorata are 117 mainly used in food and personal care products and are cultivated commonly (Azizol Abdul Kadir and Rasadah Mat Ali 1998). Table 3.

Detailed trade figures for different medicinal and aromatic plants from 1986 to 1996 are provided by Ng Lean Teik and Mohd Azmi Muhammed Idris (1997). Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials Rattan and bamboo are the most important and valuable NWFP of Malaysia. On average (1981 to 1990), rattan contributed about 13.8 percent of the total royalties collected from NWFP, while bamboo accounted for about 71 percent. Foreign exchange earnings from rattan increased from US$3 million ($M8 million) in 1981 to US$26.5 million ($M71.5 million) in 1990. Respectively earnings from bamboo increased from US$81 150 ($M219 106) in 1988 to US$176 474 ($M476 480) in 1990. In addition, these two forest industries employ 24 370 individuals, mostly rural people, in 1 685 factories (Poh Lye Yong 1994). There are about 600 rattan species in the world, of which 106 species are found in Peninsular Malaysia. Based on the National Forest Inventory (1990-1993) the estimated rattan resource was about 825 million sticks (the length of each stick being 3 m) (Abdul Razak Mohd. Ali and Abd. Latif Mohmod 1998). Table 4. Major commercial rattan species in Malaysia Species Local name Uses Calamus manan Rotan manau Furniture Walking sticks, umbrella Cheap furniture Korthalsia spp. Rotan dahan Cheap broom handles Source: Department Forestry, Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak and Sabah, in Poh Lye Yong, (1994). Commercial rattan species (about 20 according to FAO [1997]) are located in the northwest of Peninsular Malaysia, while in the south fewer canes are available, probably because of over exploitation. Rattan-processing mills are concentrated in west coast states with bigger forest areas and better infrastructure facilities. The stock of rattan species harvested and the amount of rattan 118 required by the industry are reported by Tan (1989) and Abd. Latif et al. (1990a), respectively (Abdul Razak Mohd. Ali and Abd. Latif Mohmod 1998). The planting of Calamus manan is conducted by the government and the private sector. By 1997 more than 31 000 ha had been planted. Out of this, 7 000 ha have been planted in rubber plantations throughout the country (Aminuddin and Salleh 1994; Abd. Latif and Aminuddin 1996). Large plantations in Sabah mainly grow C. caesilts and C. trachycoleus. So far about 10 000 ha have been established. C. scipionum and C. palustris are also considered as potential species for plantation (Abdul Razak Mohd. Ali and Abd. Latif Mohmod 1998). There are about 700 rattan mills and 525 are engaged in manufacturing with about 13 percent of the latter being export oriented (Abd. Latif and Aminuddin 1996). The rest are mainly cottage and small-scale industries. Annually, the rattan industry requires about nine million 3 m length sticks of the superior cane, Calamus manan , and two million 6 m length sticks of the small diameter cane, C. caesius (Abdul Razak Mohd. Ali and Abd. Latif Mohmod 1998). Peninsular Malaysia has an abundant supply of raw rattan. The total gross value collected is about $M5 million per month. The value can be increased more than twentyfold if the manufacturers concentrate on downstream processing. Increased value-added processing has increased foreign exchange earnings already and the employment opportunities in the rural-urban sectors (the export value of rattan products from Malaysia increased by 200 percent in 1990) (Abdul Razak Mohd. Ali and Abd. Latif Mohmod 1998). Bamboo is next to rattan in terms of economic importance in Malaysia. Bamboo has not, however, been utilized extensively and its use is limited to the production of poultry cages, vegetable baskets, utensil products etc. (Abdul Razak Mohd. Ali and Abd. Latif Mohmod 1998). There are about 70 known bamboo species in Malaysia: 50 in Peninsular Malaysia, 30 in Sabah and 20 in Sarawak, of which only 12 species are being utilized commercially (FAO 1997). Table 5. Commercially utilized bamboos in Malaysia Species Local names Uses Bambusa blumeana Buluh duri Toothpicks, furniture, musical instruments, shoots as food B. heterostachya Buluh galah Toothpicks, chopsticks, furniture Dendrocalamus asper Buluh as Sarawak and Sahah, in Poh Lye Yong (1994) There are 1 032 bamboo-based industries of various sizes in Peninsular Malaysia but only 104 mills have appropriate machinery to produce products such as skewers, chopsticks and toothpicks (32 mills), furniture (2 mills) and crafts (70 mills). While these 104 mills are categorized as medium and large scale, the remaining 928 mills are classified as cottage and small-scale enterprises. Cottage industries making handicraft items occur mainly in the west coast states of Peninsular Malaysia, whereas industries making poultry cages and vegetable baskets tend to concentrate plantations around Tapah in Perak (Wong 1989). The local market for bamboo products is worth about $M3 million annually (Aminuddin and Abd. Latif 1994) (Abdul Razak Mohd. Ali and Abd. Latif Mohmod 1998). Bamboo plantations should be established to ensure a continuous supply of high quality raw material. Commercially usable bamboo species grow mainly in northern Peninsular Malaysia, in logged-over forest and on river banks and hillsides (Abdul Razak Mohd. Ali and Abd. Latif Mohmod 1998). 119 120 Exudates Many chemicals, present in various parts of plants, have commercial application (e.g. latex from rubber trees, the bark of certain mangrove trees such as Rhizophora mucronata for tanning). The availability of synthetic resins has reduced the trade of natural resins (Abdul Razak Mahd. Ali and Abd. Latif Mohmod 1998). ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS Bushmeat Wildlife is exploited for protein and medicinal sources. Many wildlife habitats have been overexploited causing the displacement or death of several animal populations. The loss of forest by large-scale logging has a significant impact on wildlife. The majority of the forests affected have been the lowland forests below 100 m, which support most of the wildlife (Stevens 1968). The Javan rhinoceros ( Rhinoceros sondaicus ) and the green peafowl that once roamed the lowland region of Peninsular Malaysia are now considered to be extinct. In a recent study conducted by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP), in 1986 only 21 species of mammals and birds were threatened while in 1996 a total of 85 species were considered threatened under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (DWNP/DANCED 1996) (Sivanathan Elangupillay and Abdullah Mohd 1998). Over the last 10 years, the DWNP has collected over $M17 million in revenue from wildlife utilization for the state governments. This revenue is in the form of licenses for game, pets and from import and export taxes (Sivanathan Elangupillay and Abdullah Mohd 1998). Table 6.

A recent estimate for Sarawak showed wildlife consumption values of meat alone at about $M187 million per year (Sarawak Forest Department 1996). Applying acceptable market values for such consumption, the value of three wildlife species harvested legally would be worth about $M6.9 million per year for Peninsular Malaysia (Sivanathan Elangupillay and Abdullah Mohd 1998).

FOREST SERVICES In Malaysia hunting and wildlife recreation have served as tourist attractions, research subjects and for educational purposes. Malaysia with its abundant wildlife resources could benefit from wildlife conservation and services. The consumptive or commercial and non-consumptive uses of wildlife as NWFPs have been enormous in the areas of game hunting, tourism and nature education (Sivanathan Elangupillay and Abdullah Mohd 1998). To cater for the increasing demand for outdoor activities and recreation, a total of 85 forest recreation sites have been developed in Peninsular Malaysia. These areas coupled with the more renowned national parks such as the Taman Negara in Peninsular Malaysia, the Kinabalu National Park and Sepilok Orang Utan Rehabilitation Centre in Sabah and the Gunung Mulu National Park in Sarawak have promoted ecotourism tremendously in Malaysia. There is also the growing importance of the forest for nature education and research. Notable examples are the Pasoh Forest Reserve in Peninsular Malaysia, the Danum Valley in Sabah and the Bako National Park in Sarawak which are acclaimed internationally as centres for tropical forest studies (FAO 1997). Taman Negara is a national park, straddling the states of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang; it was established in 1938/1939 with a total area of 4 343 km2. About 10 percent of the park is designated for ecotourism development where visitors are provided access to the natural resources of the park (DWNP 1987). Table 9.

The Forestry Department, Peninsular Malaysia has already earmarked a few more areas with potential for development as forest recreation areas. The Sabah State Government has already identified future directions in the Sabah Tourism Master Plan (1995-2010). Several key sites in forest reserves such as Borneo Rain Forest Lodge in Danum Valley, Tabin Wildlife Reserves will be promoted to cater to nature tourism activities. In addition, the State Forestry Department has also identified and developed seven other forest recreation areas throughout the state. The situation is quite similar in Sarawak. The state government has acknowledged ecotourism with its growth of 10-15 percent per annum as an important source of foreign exchange (FAO 1997). 124 QUANTITATIVE NWFP DATA OF MALAYSIA Product Resource Economic value Category Import- ance Trade name Generic term Species Part used Habitat Source Desti- nation Quantity, value Remarks References 1, 2, 3 F, P, O W, C N, I Plants and plant products Medicines Medicinal plants N, I Annual sales' value in country: $M500 million in 1994; estimated market value: $M1-2 billion in 1995.

Other NWFP include spices, medicinal plants, straws, tanning barks, perfumes, exudates, honey and beeswax, bushmeat, lac and bat guano. General information About half of the total land area of Myanmar (676 777 km2) is covered with forests. These public forests are classified either as Reserved Forests or Unclassed Forests. The Reserved Forests have legal protection but the government allows rural communities to use the products of Unclassed Forests, with the exception of certain protected plant and animal species (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). In Myanmar, forest products are divided into commercial and minor forest produce. Minor forest produce is defined as \"all kinds of forest produce other than timber and firewood\", including animals, vegetables and mineral products. For rural communities depending on NWFP for subsistence and for trade, the NWFP are probably more important than timber or other forest products (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). Myanmar's NWFP can be divided into 13 groups according to their nature and uses: bamboo; cane (rattan); tanning bark; straw (bast); scented gum, and spice; material; dyeing material; other miscellaneous products (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). The Forest Department in Myanmar counts the following NWFP for trade purposes: bamboo, cane thanatkha, roofing materials, te, honey, beeswax, bat guano, thitsi, edible bird nests, lac, orchids, bomayaza and pine resin (Khin Maung Lwin 1995).

Some important species include: Most rural dwellers living near forests rely on edible plant products, such as buds, leaves, flowers, fruits, tubers, corms and shoots. Other seasonal foods are edible mushrooms and fungi. Besides nutrients, the forest food provides cash income for rural people (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). Medicines Most rural people use traditional indigenous medicines. Recently, the Myanmar Medical Research Department and the pharmaceutical industry upgraded various indigenous medicines, which has resulted in an increase in demand for medicinal plants as raw materials. Some prominent medicinal plants construction materials Bamboo is the most important NWFP of Myanmar. About 100 species grow in large quantities throughout the country, the most common bamboo species being used for utensils, handicrafts and construction materials. In addition pickled bamboo shoots are becoming very popular. As an industrial raw material, in Myanmar bamboo is used 130 commonly by pulp and paper mills. With the scarcity of raw materials for pulp and paper factories in neighbouring countries, the future of bamboo as a raw material for paper and rayon making is very promising (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). About 36 species of canes or rattans grow in swampy areas of semi-evergreen and evergreen forests in Myanmar. The commonly used species in log-rafting as binding materials, and in small-scale enterprises which produce furniture, baskets, handicrafts, mats, etc. Finished cane products have been exported, supposedly to produce more employment opportunities in collecting, processing and trading cane. Most cane however, is exported unprocessed at lower prices because of the poor processing technology and limited experience in trading (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). Traditionally, the people of Myanmar have used the straw (bast) of some plants for tying materials. Rural people still use traditional plant fibres while urban people nowadays use synthetic ropes. Plant fibre ropes are essential for domestic and farming activities in rural areas. Traditional mats (thinbyu) are woven with the best of thin ( Clinogyne dichotoma ) and the inner portions can be used as string. The families Sterculiaceae and Tiliaceae include good fibre-yielding plants which grow widely in Myanmar. The most important species for rope-making most important NWFP is roofing thatch made from leaves. Common and trading of roofing materials are income-generating part-time activities for rural people (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). Dyeing and tanning Synthetic dyes have been introduced in the textile industry to replace natural dyes while the rural people continue to use natural dyes for certain purposes. The most important species of the family Rhizophoraceae. The expansion of the leather industry has had a positive influence on the demand for tanning barks (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). Cutch is of she ( Acacia caetechu ) growing in dry areas of Myanmar. It is used as a dye and a preservative for fishing nets and canvas. The people enjoy chewing betel with katha, which is separated from cutch. Cutch also contains tannic acid and can be used as a tannin (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). Perfumes and used in fragrances, scented sticks and medicines. These species are rare in natural forests and consequently very expensive. The bark and wood of thanatkha ( Hesperethusa caenulata ) are the 131 most popular traditional cosmetics in Myanmar. Thanatkha is in great demand and its price is high due to the increased manufacturing of cosmetics (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). Exudates The most common Maung Lwin 1995). Others About 840 species of orchids grow in Myanmar. Some of them are highly valuable and also exported. (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS Animals provide many valuable trade products, such as lac, edible bird nests, honey and beeswax, bat guano, hides, bones and horn (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). Honey and beeswax Wild honey is preferred to the honey from the hives of beekeepers. Wild honey is used for preparing foodstuffs and in Myanmar's indigenous medicines. Two of the most common honey-bees in Myanmar, Apis indica and A. dorsata , are found throughout Myanmar (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). Bushmeat Rural people hunt birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects (a major protein supplement) for food and to earn extra cash (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). Other edible animal products Edible bird nests are composed of a white gelatinous substance secreted by the salivary swiftlet ( Collocalia inexpectata ). These precious products used in indigenous Chinese tonics are obtained from natural caves in the Myeik Archipelago and on some islands off the Pathein coast. Only licensed traders controlled by the Forest Department can collect the nests, which produce good foreign exchange earnings (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). Other non-edible animal products Lac is a resinous substance secreted by lac insects general the quality of lac depends on the species of the host tree (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). Bat guano is collected for use as a natural fertilizer, which gives high crop yields at low cost. The bats live in the rocky, mountainous areas of Myanmar (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). Rural people make good money selling the hides, bones and horns of forest animals. The hides of some animals are in great demand for the leather industry. Bones and horns are used for handicraft production and to decorate living rooms. Some tribes keep and wear some parts of the bones, horns and hides (Khin Maung Lwin 1995). 132 REFERENCES Khin Maung Lwin. 1995. Myanmar.

Other important NWFP include sal seed, katha and cutch, sabai grass, bamboo and cane. General information In Nepal, NWFP are used for subsistence as well as for trade at national and international levels. Edwards (1996) has summarized a list of 39 of the most important NWFP at national and international levels. These NWFP contribute 4 percent of the total contribution of forestry to the national economy. In Nepal, jaributi refers to a gr oup of NWFP collected from the wild in the mountains and traded in India as raw materials for industries related to pharmaceuticals, food, beverages or perfumes. The trade volume is enormous but for the most part remains invisible (Sharma 1995). Table 1.

The proceedings of the third South and East Asian Countries NTFP Network Workshop on Community Based Non-timber Forest Products Management reported that about 2 000 plants in Nepal have medicinal properties and 1 463 plants are known to be used locally (Shrestha and Shrestha 1999). The majority of NWFP fall into two contrasting groups: high value products from high altitudes, and low value products from lower altitudes (below 2 000 m). Most NWFP collection in Nepal occurs at high altitudes and in remote Himalayan regions. The primary collectors are women and children near villages and men in remote areas. In general NWFP are collected from forest land. Much of the harvesting takes place between August and September through December. The decision to engage in the collection of NWFP depends on product value, distance and access to collection area, abundance of plants in that area, alternative employment opportunities and the relative wealth of the household. Typically, it is the poorest household that engages in commercial collection of NWFP (Olsen 1998). Income from the collection of medicinal and aromatic plants for rural households varies from 0 to 50 percent of annual household earnings. 136 Table 2.

Recently HPPCL (Herbal Pr oducts Processing Company Limited), a governmental organization, and Dabur Nepal in itiated the cultivation of some important NWFP. According to Bhattarai and Maharjan (2000), HPPCL has introduced farming, processing and sustainable collection practices for NWFP on its own farms, private land and community forests involving local communities. Table 6.

In Nepal fodder is not regarded as a minor forest product, being one of the main products of the forests, and therefore it is not included in descriptions and analyses of NWFP (Khatri 1994). 138 PLANTS AND PLANT PRODUCTS Food Aside from being a major source of building timber, sal ( Shorea robusta ) is a prolific producer of seeds. Sal seed has a high oil content and the oil extracted from it has many industrial and household uses. Sal fat has been used as a partial substitute for cocoa butter in Japan, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. Large quantities of sal fat, either crude, neutralized or dry-fractioned, have been exported to the United Kingdom, Japan and some other countries since 1970. Studies documenting export quantities and their values have not been carried out (Khatri 1994). Katha is an extract derived from the heartwood of khair ( Acacia catechu ) by boiling. It is a clay- coloured crystalline substance used in the preparation of pan, a chewing material popular in Asia and East Africa. Cutch, a by-product of katha production, is a black reddish gum resin which is used in tanning, dyeing and as a lubricant in oil-well drilling. It is also a traditional component for making medicines (Khatri 1994). Almost all katha and cutch is exported to India (best quality katha US$15/kg, kutch at US$0.80/kg) (Coppen [1994] and nuts Castanopsis hystrix, C. indica, C. tribuliodes and Juglans regia. Medicines Medicinal plants play an important role in satisfying the health needs of the population because access to modern health facilities in the country is limited. Trade of medicinal plants provides crucial income to rural collectors. A small portion of the plants collected is used locally and about 90 percent is sold as crude herbs, mainly for export (Khatri 1994). Usually, medicinal plants are harvested from common property resources. Some valuable medicinal plant species are facing the threat of extinction due to indiscriminate collection for swift monetary gains (Rawal 1995). A total ban on collecti on, use and export has been imposed for Dactylorhiza hatagirea, Juglans regia (bark) and Picrorhiza scrophulariflora (Nepal Gazette 2001) . Nine species are banned Cordyceps sinensis). Trading, movement and natural forests). Table 7. Annual production of selected medicinal plants (tonnes) Year Source: Annual Reports, Department of Forests, HMG/Nepal (1998). Data from 1994 to 1996 are not available. 139 The leaves and small branches of Taxus baccata (lauth salla) produce resin, which can be used as an anticarcinogen. Up to 72 kg of fresh leaves per day can be harvested, equivalent to 36 kg of dried leaves (Paudel and Rosset 1998). According to the Department of Forests the collection of leaves has been increasing (227 tonnes in 1997/1997, 253 tonnes in 1997/1998). Table 8.

Cultivation practices have been developed for some species. Nepal has some processing facilities but these facilities are quite insignificant relative to the volumes traded in India and most of the value added production is performed in India (Sharma 1995). The production of atis ( Delphinium himalayai) was 2 800 tonnes in 1995 (New Era 2001) and the production of ritha ( Sapindus mukuorossi) 746.16 tonnes in 1996/1997 and 1 042.57 tonnes in 1997/1998.

The conventional oils such as palmarosa, citronella, lemon grass and tagetes have a growing demand from foreign customers. The case is similar with certain newly introduced unconventional items such as Rhododendron anthopogon oil. Jatamansi oil (Nardostachys jatamansi) and xanthoxylum (Zanthoxylum armatum ) oil require greater efforts for successful export. The future of the essential oil industry looks promising, with foreign firms entering Nepal for the manufacture of soaps and detergents (Rawal 1995). It has been estimated that about 39 300 kg of dried jatamansi were marketed whereas its production potential could be more than 100 000 kg (New Era 2001). Indian traders have estimated that 90 percent of the jatamansi drug in the Indian market originates from Nepal. The figure for the export of jatamansi oil was about 500 kg of oil during the fiscal year 1994/1995. Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials Daphne spp., locally known as lokta, is used as raw material for hand-made paper. It is the basis for an expanding cottage industry with an annual turnover of around NR10 million. The industry provides direct employment for about 1 500 families (Khatri 1994). Lokta paper is used for many purposes, from legal documentation to record-keeping paper, religious scriptures, file folders, envelopes, greeting cards and calendars. The total domestic consumption as office paper comes to about 7.4 million sheets annually, or about 185 tonnes. Other end-users consume the remaining 115 tonnes. Nepali hand-made paper is consumed in local as well as international markets. From 1981 to 1985, UNICEF purchased about 1.6 million sheets 140 for greeting cards. The value of exports of hand-made paper has varied between NR0.2 million and NR1.2 million between 1982 and 1986 (Khatri 1994). Table 10.

For paper making, sabai is reputed to be superior to most other available grasses. Small paper mills have been operating since 1986. These paper mills have been designed to take sabai grass and straw as raw material. These mills have a combined capacity of about 70 tonnes per day (Khatri 1994). Although the Indian paper industries have been using Nepal's sabai grass for a long time, after the establishment of paper industries in Nepal the Indian industries have been discouraged from purchasing Nepalese sabai. Thus there is now no significant export of sabai grass (Khatri 1994). Bamboo is economically important both for rural and urban people as a construction material. Karki and Karki (1997) have listed 15 types of major bamboo species and their traditional uses. The largest bamboo in Nepal is in the genera Bambusa and Dendrocalamus . The smaller bamboo falls in the genera Arundinaria and Thamnocalamus . Bamboo and cane are used extensively by the Nepalese for fodder, to make traditional baskets, mats and furniture, and for building in rural areas. The habitats of commercially exploitable bamboo and cane have been reduced to the brink of disappearance (Kathri 1994). At present there is no significant export of bamboo from Nepal. Recent studies by Amatya (1997) and Amatya et al. (1998) showed that three tenuis, Calamus leptospadix and Nepal. Among them Calamus tenuis is used most widely and economically it is the most important. Rattan is used mainly in furniture. There are a few cottage industries that utilize rattan. The monthly turnover of these industries ranges from US$35 to US$107. Other important fibres used in paper Exudates Resin is tapped from pine trees and has great economic significance. It provides raw materials for domestic use and for the rosin and turpentine industries in Nepal. Oleoresin gums are the native chir Only chir pine can be tapped economically, yielding about 3 to 5 kg annually per tree. The estimated potential of pine resin in Nepal is about 21 700 tonnes per year (Khatri 1994). Local production of rosin and its derivatives has provided much needed income to collectors in rural areas, and has reduced the need to import rosin and turpentine (Khatri 1994). Some rosin is exported to India. 141 Table 11.

FOREST SERVICES According to the report by Dr Swoyambhu Man Amatya, the only important non-wood service is grazing by livestock. Livestock grazing takes place throughout the year but there is no information on livestock types and the extent of the area grazed. Since some valuable species of medicinal plants are facing the threat of extinction due to indiscriminate collection, national parks and wildlife reserves have been established to protect the natural ecosystem. National parks and wildlife reserves occupy 14 percent of the total land area (Rawal 1995). 144 QUANTITATIVE NWFP DATA OF NEPAL Product Resource Economic Value Importance Habitat Source Destination Category 1, 2, 3 Trade name Generic term Species Part used F, P, O W, C N, I Quantity, Value Remarks References Plant and plant products 1 Sal seed Shorea robusta se F W N,I 1984-1986: average of 430 000 litres of seed oil and 3 500 MT of de-oiled cake Jackson 1994 Food 1 Katha and kutch hw F Khanyu semicordata Pandey 1982 2 l C 1990 3 Dhudhilo Ficus nerifolia Jackson 1994 3 Gogan Saurauria C N Amatya Quercus semecarpifolia l W 1990 Kutmero Litsea monopetala Picrorhiza scrophulariiflora ro, st F, O W N, I 47 MT in 1997/98 Dept. of Forests 1998 1 Chiraitio Swertia chiraita pl F, P, O W, C N, I 286 MT in 1997/98 Dept. of Forests 1998 Medicinal and aromatic plants 1 Timur Zanthoxylum armatum se F W N,I 260 MT in 1993/94 Dept. of Forests 1995 145 Product Resource Economic Value Importance Habitat Source Destination Category 1, 2, 3 Trade name Generic term Species Part used F, P, O W, C N, I Quantity, Value Remarks References Plant and plant products 1 Yarsa gumba Cordyseps sinesis O W N,I In India sold at NR28 000/kg In remote districts sold at NR3 to 5 per piece Amatya 2001 1 Panch aule Dactylorhiza hatagirea O 1996 1 Tejpat Cinnamomum tamala le F W N,I 101 MT in 1997/98 Dept. of Forests 1998 1 Dalchini Cinnamomum jalanicum ba F W N,I 87 MT in of Forests 1998 1 Ritha Sapindus mukuorossi fr F,O W, C N, I 1 043 MT in 1997/98 Dept. of Forests 1998 1 Kurilo/ Satawari Asparagus racemosus ro F W N,I 27 MT Dept. of Forests 1998 1 Nagbeli Lycopodium clavatum pd F W N 34 MT in 1997/98 Dept. of Forests 1998 1 Lauth salla Taxus baccata le F W N,I 253 MT in 1997/98 Dept. of Forests 1998 2 Guche chau Morchella corina pl F W N,I 100 MT in 1995 New Era 2001 3 Atis Delphinium himalayai pl F,O W N 2 800 MT in 1995 New Era 2001 1 Jatamasi Nardostachys jatamansi ro F, O W N, I 97 MT in 1997/98 Dept. of Forests 1998 146 Product Resource Economic Value Importance Habitat Source Destination Category 1, 2, 3 Trade name Generic term Species Part used F, P, O W, C N, I Quantity, Value Remarks References Plant and plant products 2 Sugandhawal Valeriana jatamansi ro F,O W N,I 48 MT in 1997/98 22 MT in 1996/97 Dept. of Forests 1998 Dyeing and tanning 1 Majito Rubia manjith p F W N, I 87 MT in 1997/98 105 MT in 1996/97 Dept. of Forests 1998 1 Padamchal Rheum emodi ro W N 18 MT in 1997/98 Plantations: 13 557 seedlings in 1999 17 000 seedlings in 2000 Dept. of Forests 1998 Utensils, handicrafts, construction materials 1 Lokta Daphne bholua, Daphne papyracea ba F W N, I 700 000 sheets in 1984, 1983/84: 35 000 kg of paper Jeanreneud 1984 Acharya 1984 2 Leyas/ murali Ampelocalamus W Average rosin; 3 41 MT of turpentine produced in 1999 Nepal Rosin & Turpentine Co. 2001 Importance: 1 - high importance at the national level; 2 - high importance at the local/regional level; 3 - low importance Parts used: an - whole animal; ba - bark; bw - beeswax; le - fibres; - flowers; - fruits; - g ho - honey; la - latex; oi - oil; pl - whole plant; re - resins; ro - roots; sa - sap; se - rtwood (hw); shoot (sh); tuber Habitat: F natural forest or other wooded lands; P - plantation; O - trees outside forests (e.g. agroforestry, home gardens) Source: W - wild, C - cultivated Destination: N - national; I - international 147 PAPUA NEW GUINEA INTRODUCTION Main non-wood forest products The most important NWFP of Papua New Guinea are food from plants (tubers/corms, fruits, nuts and vegetables), mushrooms, medicinal plants, rattan, bamboo and orchids. Other important NWFP include bushmeat, copal gum, vatica, massoy bark, tannins and insects (butterflies). General information Papua New Guinea has some of the richest flora and fauna in the world. There are about 9 000 species of higher plants including 1 500 trees. Nearly 90 percent of the population of 3.5 million lives in rural areas, where most basic needs are met through gathering and hunting in forests for food (fruits, roots, wild animals), fibres, medicines and culturally important products such as adornments like feathers of birds (Srivastava 1994). The utilization of NWFP has great potential but is very neglected (Saulei and Aruga 1994). PLANTS AND PLANT PRODUCTS Food The staple food items of Papua New Guineans are mainly carbohydrate-rich sp.) and bananas (Musa sp.). Much of the supplementary food (green vegetables, fruits and nuts) is collected from the wild, like and Aruga [1994]) listed some 251 species of food plants in Papua New Guinea of which 157 species (73 percent) were collected from savannahs, forests and grasslands; 51 species (20 percent) were both harvested from the wild and cultivated, and 43 (17 percent) were only cultivated. Seventy-six species were used as supplementary vegetables, the most a mushroom that occurs naturally in Papua New Guinea. It is a very popular food in Southeast Asia, China and Japan and also in some other countries. Shiitake grows on the deadwood of oak and beech trees (both from the family Fagaceae). Cultivation of shiitake is very profitable and can increase the incomes of farmers remarkably. One cubic meter of log can produce five kilogrammes of dried mushroom annually for four to five years after initial inoculation; the annual income obtained ranges from K1 500 to 2 040 (when the export price is K10-12/kg) (Shrivastava 1995). Sago palm ( Metroxylon spp.) has very high contents of starch in its trunk and the sago flour is an important staple food for coastal communities. The species Metroxylon sagu and M. rumphii are the most important species. Riechert (1986) estimated that the annual consumption of sago starch in Papua New Guinea could be 15 000 tonnes (Shrivastava 1995). Sago leaves are used for thatching 148 house roofs and walls, the fronds for wall cladding, the midribs for fish traps and the pith offers an excellent substrate for mushrooms and sago grubs (Saulei and Aruga 1994). Powel (1976) (in Saulie and Aruga [1994]) has listed 48 species of plants that serve as fruits in Papua New Guinea. Important fruit plants include breadfruit, cultivated and utilized by local people. Saulei and Aruga (1994) have listed some 25 plant species that produce edible nuts which are used as seasonal supplementary food. Medicines Powel (1976) (in Shrivastava 1995) has provided a list of 22 plant species and their medicinal uses in Papua New Guinea. Moreover, Nick et al. (1995) have provided a list of 17 species of medicinal plants used in the traditional medicine. Mebs (1999) studied the traditional use of plants to treat snake bites in northern Papua New Guinea and identified six species. Further, Saulei and Aruga (1994) have listed some 55 medicinal plant species. Perfumes and cosmetics The tree species of oils (Shrivastava 1995) but there are no records on their production and trade. Dyeing and tanning A number of trees (e.g. Rhizophora , Brugueira and Acacia spp.) produce tannin but no tannin production occurs in the country (Shrivastava 1995). Traditionally tannins have been used for body decoration or personal effects (Saulei and Aruga 1994). Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials Papua New Guinea is famous for its artifacts. A number of plant species, especially ebony (Diospyros sp.) and Anthocephalus chinensis , are used for artifacts and musical instruments, which are exported too. Species commonly used for house construction, canoes and artifacts used for a variety of end-uses including construction, tying, fuel, drinks and food (Shrivastava 1995). In 1994 a total of 27 bamboo species the are used by rural communities for housing, fencing, gardening, agricultural implements, musical instruments, fishing and hunting tools. Because of the lack of information on their properties, for instance, bamboo products have not been commercialized (Shrivastava 1995). 149 About 60 to 100 rattan species have been estimated to exist in Papua New Guinea. There are vast resources especially in the Sepik and Gulf provinces (Saulei and Korthalsia brasii have been identified as the most common species. Extraction of rattan in the forests is carried out mostly by the landowners. Rattan is used by rural communities for various articles and attempts have been made to develop small-scale industries. From 1985 to 1990 a number of initiatives to develop the rattan-based cottage industry took place (Shrivastava 1995). The boom in rattan exports is largely because of export bans on raw rattans from Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines (Saulei and Aruga 1994). Table 1. Exports of rattan, 1988 to 1992 Year Volume (MT) Value(FOB)K'000 1988 98 45.4 1989 Na Na 1990 65 40.3 1991 394.2 226.2 1992 108.5 (often called Manila copal in the market). Copal has been exported to Europe and Singapore for some time (Shrivastava 1995), but no recent records on production and trade exist. Vatica papuana is the source of dammar hiru or vatica resin (Shivastava 1995). No current records are available on its production and trade. Others Over 2 746 species of orchids belonging to 148 genera have been reported. According to some estimates Papua New Guinea may have about 65 percent of the world's population of orchids and many of the genera and species still need to be identified. Two of the largest genera include Dendrobium and Bulbophyllum (Shrivastava 1995). A total ban on the export of orchids collected from the wild was enforced in 1990 by the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC); it permitted collection and export of cultivated orchids only. Some village farms were established in the late 1970s to attract tourists. Flowers on these farms were being sold at K2.00 whilst the National Capital District Botanic Garden (NCDBG) was exporting the flowers at K10.00 (Kabaru 1992). Although the village farms have not functioned as envisaged, tourism potential is often associated with orchid cultivation. The value of the domestic cut-flower trade has been evaluated at upwards of K50 000 annually (Shrivastava 1995). No recent figures on trade on massoy ( Cryptocarya spp.) bark exist although trade is supposed to exist (Saulei and Aruga 1994). The same applies to trade on sandalwood ( Santalum magregorii F. Muell.). 150 ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS Honey and beeswax Shrivastava (1995) reported that beekeeping is becoming popular among smallholder cooperative projects in the highlands and the villagers involved have been provided with training and support. Bushmeat Liem and Haines (1977) in Shrivastava (1995) have provided a list of 25 wildlife species utilized by the rural communities. Birds and animals are hunted for their meat. The hides and feathers of many animals are used for clothing and decoration and are valued highly in traditional exchanges. Wildlife has become an important source of cash for many villagers; a live cassowary is valued at US$1 620 (Saulei and Aruga 1994). Other edible/non-edible animal products According to Shrivastava (1995) there are good prospects for developing small village-based projects on insect farming. Papua New Guinea has a very rich insect population; for example, butterflies are amongst the most popular souvenirs from the country (Shrivastava 1995). Butterfly farming was started in 1974 in the Garaina area of Morobe Province and in 1994 there were around 500 farmers engaged in the industry over the whole country. The Insect Farming and Trading Agency, responsible for the exports, pays the collectors a rate of US$1 to US$20, depending on the rarity of the species (Saulei and Aruga 1994). Mercer (1989) (in Saulei and Aruga 1994) estimated the annual value of the butterfly trade to be US$250 000. REFERENCES Saulei, S.M. & Aruga, J.A. 1994.

FOREST SERVICES Wildlife has a symbolic significance, and plays an important role in villagers' everyday lives. Different clans have special relationships with particular species which serve as their totems.

Other NWFP include essential oils, dyes, wild food plants, medicinal plants, honey and butterflies. General information In the Philippines, NWFP are classified and referred to as \"minor forest products\". They are an important source of food for rural people, the principal source of fibre and forage and a valuable raw material for furniture and handicraft manufacture in the cottage industry. NWFP are also used in the manufacture of pulp and paper, plastic, paint and varnish, soap and shampoo. These products are also important sources of materials for low-cost housing, food and beverages, clothing materials, medicine and other valuable products. NWFP have provided people who live in or near forest lands, especially subsistence upland farmers and the unemployed or underemployed in the lowlands, with sources of income (Neri 1994). The Philippine Forestry Statistics contains production figures for certain NWFP (trade and market values are not included). Table 1.

Most of the processors are cottage-type or backyard- level industries employing not more than 20 workers. There are about 250 medium to large firms which are involved primarily in the manufacture of rattan and bamboo furniture for export. With the declining importance of wood-based industries, and the prospect of more restrictive logging bans, attention has shifted to the development of NWFP-based industries. Wasteful utilization and the destruction of much of the country's forests have also resulted in the depletion of several NWFP (Neri 1994). At present, there is a growing export demand for finished and semifinished products such as Philippine rattan furniture, baskets and other native products made of indigenous raw materials such as vines, barks, roots and bast fibres. Other manufactured NWFP exports include buri and pandan placemats, handbags, wallets, purses and similar articles of palm and bamboo, buntal and buri hats. The total export value in 1998 for basketwork (wickerwork), Christmas decorations and other manufactured materials were US$66 189 066; US$83 345 578 and US$14 006 498, respectively (DTI Markets of Philippine Merchandise Exports, January to September 1997/1998). On the other hand the total export values for selected NWFP-based furniture in 1998 were US$1 436 368; US$79 475 485 and US$1 606 138 for bamboo furniture, rattan furniture and buri furniture, respectively (Philippine Forestry Statistics 1998). The extraction and gathering of NWFP on forest land is regulated legally by the government through the issuance of licences or permits, but an undetermined quantity of NWFP is extracted illegally (Neri 1994). PLANTS AND PLANT PRODUCTS Utensils, handicrafts, construction materials There are about 62 species of rattan found in the Philippines and 12 of these are of commercial value: (palasan has played a major role in the economy of the Philippines' flourishing furniture and handicraft industry. The rapid growth and expansion of the rattan industry has caused a heavy drain in the domestic supply of rattan canes. From 1993 to 1997 rattan furniture and handicraft exports earned a total of US$600 million (Philippine Forestry Statistics 1997) growing at 14 percent annually in the same period. Rattan products were exported to the United States, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom and France. Similarly within that period, the Philippines imported from China, Hong Kong and Singapore approximately US$2.8 million of raw rattan poles to supplement the local supply. Regulations have been applied to rationalize the development of the rattan industry. Separate areas are allocated for large and small entrepreneurs. If the rattan production areas are within lands reserved for or occupied by tribal groups, priority is given to the tribal groups (Neri 1994). However, illegal harvesting of high quality rattan canes still continues. 155 There are around 32 species of bamboo found in the Philippines. Bamboo species suitable for furniture, handicrafts, and novelty items are: 1991). Bamboo areas are estimated to range from about 39 000 to 52 000 ha. It is distributed physically as follows: 20 500 to 34 000 ha from forest land; 2 236 ha from government plantations; 3 037 ha from private plantations and 13 434 ha from natural stands. From these bamboo stands, the projected potentially available culm production ranges from 29 million to 52 million poles harvested every year (Virtucio et al. 1983; RP-German Forest Resources Inventory Project). Bamboo export consists mainly of basket/basketware (92.47 percent) and furniture (7.41 percent). Philippine bamboo is exported to 36 countries. The United States is the single biggest market for furniture. Other major buyers are Spain, France, Australia, Italy and the Netherlands (FOSTER- Asia 1998). Palms, well represented in the Philippines. Palms are as important as bamboo and rattan. There are about 123 native palm species in the Philippines plus other introduced palms classified as either \"climbing\" or \"erect\" and about 149 vines and bast fibre species. These are the primary raw materials for the basketry industry. Ninety percent of the total production of the basketry industry is for export (DOST 1996). Palms have several uses. For instance nipa ( Nypa fruticans ) sap can be used for alcohol, wine, sugar and vinegar; its leaves can be used for bags and hats; its fruits are used as medicine for intestinal worms; leaves are also used to make shingles for roofing and walls for low-cost houses; the midribs are made into brooms and the petioles are used as fuel. The fermented juice is a popular local drink (Neri 1994). In 1998 the production of nipa shingles was 6 746 000 pieces (Philippine Forestry Statistics 1998). In 1998 exports of buri were 13 708 kg (US$38 580) (Philippine Forestry Statistics 1998). Production of anahaw leaves decreased from 48 000 in 1981 to 19 000 pieces in 1998. The trunk of the anahaw is used for handicrafts, utensils and construction materials; the leaves are used for roofing, the buds are eaten and the plant is also used as an some of the more important climbers. Diliman is used chiefly as tying material in the preparation of fish traps because of its durability in salt water. It is also used for making ropes and baskets. Nito is the name used for different species of Lygodium , although the most common and widely used species in the country is Lygodium circinnatum . It is used in the manufacture of baskets, hats, bags and other fancy articles. The central cylinders of the roots of Pothos are used in baskets. Baling-uai is a vine used in tying, in sewing nipa shingles and in making baskets (Neri 1994). Salago ( Wikstroemia spp.) is a shrub with an exceptionally high fibre potential. Fibres extracted from its bark are excellent materials for the manufacture of high grade paper used in bank notes, cheques, paper for legal documents and other specialty papers requiring strength and durability. Four species of this genus are known for their quality fibres, namely: small leaf salago 156 (Wikstroemia indica ); lance leaf ( W. lanceolata) ; large leaf salago ( W. meyeniana) and round leaf salago ( W. ovata) (Brown 1921). Table 2.

The average export price for salago fibre was observed to be increasing steadily from 1986 to 1990. In 1998 a total of 645 840 kg of salago bark valued at US$443 990 were exported to China, Japan, Korea and Thailand. In the Philippines, there are 40 known species of pandan ( Pandanus ). Among the most pandan leaves are used for making coarse and fine baskets, bags, hats, mats, picture frames and other novelty items. Pandan leaves are good material for making low-cost cocoon frames for silkworm production. The wood of some pandan species is also used in the manufacture of splints for making baskets. It is estimated that there are 58.88 billion stems of pandans in the Philippines. Pandan placemats are exported to Canada, French Polynesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Turkey and the United States. In 1998, the total export of pandan placemats was 56 770 pieces, valued at US$(FOB)90 934.00 (Philippine Forestry Statistics 1998). Exudates Gum- are distributed widely in open areas and in second growth forests throughout the Philippines. Resins and gums (especially Manila copal and Manila elemi) are the main NWFP exported in raw form. Almost all resins that are produced are exported. In 1998, 355 000 kg of Almaciga resin with an FOB value of US$254 000 and 221 000 kg of Manila elemi with an FOB value of US$448 000 were exported. There are insufficient processing factories in the country. 157 Table 3.

Most original information on drug-producing plants is derived from traditional practitioners, known locally as herbolario. The creation of the National Integrated Research Program on Medicinal Plants (NIRPROMP) has provided scientific groundwork for the development of herbal medicines in the Philippines. Through this programme, four herbal pharmaceutical plants were established in the Philippines (i.e. Tuguegarao and Cagayan in Luzon Island, Tacloban City in Visayas Island and Cotabato City in Mindanao Island). At present, the production of these four Department of Health (DOH) plantations is limited to the Investment-Department of Trade and Industry 1999). The exports of herbal products are minimal. Various countries such as China, Romania, Iran and Iraq have shown interest in importing herbal medicines such as lagundi and sambong from the Philippines. Perfumes and cosmetics More than 50 plants have been identified to contain essential oils. Plants that have the potential for commercial extraction 1994). Due to inefficient manufacturing practices, the essential oil industry of the Philippines has to import more than 90 percent of its raw materials. The cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries imported essential oil products worth US$96.5 million in 1997 (Bureau of Export Trade Promotion, Department of Trade and Industry 2000). Herbal soaps and shampoos and other care products are becoming popular too, especially with the urban populace. Dyeing and tanning Plant dyes are used for colouring mats, textiles and in food products. For instance, the sappan has been exported. 158 ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS Honey Annually, NATRIPAL (United Tribes of Palawan) is marketing 200 to 300 gallons of honey mostly to local tourist markets and traders in Manila. In 1997 deliveries of honey totalled six tonnes. Medicine Demand for monkeys as experimental animals (a source for polio vaccine) and the legal phase- out on the collection and trade of wild monkeys have encouraged commercial companies to engage in the captive breeding of monkeys. Six companies are involved in the trade of animals for experiments. Other non-edible animal products Butterflies (e.g. Graphium agamemnon ) are bred and traded in commercial quantities and exported as pupae and dried adult specimens (DENR-UNEP 1997).

Other important NWFP in Sri Lanka are edible plants, honey and grazing. General information According to the Forest Ordinance of Sri Lanka the following materials are declared \"non-wood forest produce\": /circle6 Leaves, flowers and fruit, seeds, juice, catechu, wood oil, resin, natural varnish, bark, lac, gum and myrabolans. /circle6 Plants that are not trees, including grass, creepers, reed moss and all parts or produce of such plants. /circle6 Tusk horns, shed horns and edible bird nests. /circle6 Peat, surface soil, rocks and minerals, including limestone, laterite, bitumen, bituminous shale, asphalt, mineral oils and all products of mines or quarries (Bharathie 1994). Due to cultural and socio-economic factors, such as the caste system and poverty, even those people who live at a considerable distance from forests are also engaged in the collection of NWFP (FD/IUCN 1995). Table 1.

Few NWFP enter the foreign market, with the exception of handicrafts made from bamboo and rattan. The sales of bamboo and rattan goods were SL Rs2.5 million in 1986. According to Bharathie (1994) sales have declined since then. Table 2. Average number of NWFP collected by forest type Forest type Climatic region Number of NWFP Montane forests Montane zone 1-3 Submontane forests Wet zone 3-7 Lowland rain forests Wet zone 3-7 Moist monsoon forests Intermediate zone 4-6 Dry monsoon forests Dry zone 4-8 166 Savannah forests Dry zone 3-8 Source: FD/IUCN (1995) Only little processing is done prior to their sale. Most industries based on NWFP generate only part-time employment, with the exception of the bamboo and rattan industries (Bharathie 1994). PLANTS AND PLANT PRODUCTS Food Kitul ( Caryota urens ) is a multipurpose tree species found in natural forests and home gardens. This species provides a variety of popular products, of which the sap is the most important. Kitul sap is the base for local beer (toddy), treacle and jaggery. Treacle and jaggery are sugary substances which are used in preparing a variety of traditional sweets. Other non-wood kitul products include the sago-like pith, which forms a valuable food, and kitul fibre, which is obtained from the leaves (Bandaratillake 1995). Kitul tapping has a long history in Sri Lanka. A special cast (hakuru) makes their living from kitul tapping and jaggery making. In general the income generated by villagers from tapping is sufficient for their normal livelihoods. In most of the wet zone forests, kitul products generate over 70 percent of NWFP income for village communities (Bandaratillake 1995). The average value of kitul products from lowland rain forests is around SL Rs.20 000/ha/year (US$200/ha/year). The average household income from kitul products ranges between SL Rs.15 000-20 000/year. Table 3.

Products are marketed either through middlemen or directly by producers. One of the basic problems in marketing jaggery and treacle is the lack of quality control measures. Kitul toddy marketing has been affected seriously by current legal restrictions. As a result, toddy is either consumed by the tappers or sold secretly in villages. Kitul products are not exported at present (Bandaratillake 1995). The role of edible plants may not be very important at the national level, but quite a large number of people who live in the vicinity of forest areas still depend on the forests for some of their food needs. In the intermediate and dry zone forests, collection rates are high (65-70 percent of households), while in montane forest zones, far fewer people collect food from the forests (20 percent of households) (Bandaratillake 1995). Common edible plants gathered from Sri Lankan forests are listed in Bandaratillake (1995). There are two major groups of edible plants: edible higher plants and fungi (mushrooms). Most of the parts of edible higher plants such as roots, tubers, bark, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds, are used as food (Bandaratillake 1995). Four major types of yams are collected. yam is the most common. Harvesting yams from the forest for domestic consumption is an island-wide activity (Bandaratillake are consumed as both fruits and vegetables (Bandaratillake 1995). Some other fruits collected by the Some of these fruits fetch high prices in the local market. Many other food items collected from the forest are consumed as vegetables or fruits; for instance the dried seeds of mee ( Palaquim grande ) are used for the extraction of edible oil (Bandaratillake 1995). Most foods are used for household consumption, although a limited number of items are sold in markets (Bandaratillake 1995). Mushroom collection is a country-wide activity in every forest type. Kamalhathu and aturuhatu are found in the lowland rain forests and submontane forests, and indololu and several other types are found in the moist monsoon and dry monsoon forests. The highest mushroom collections have been recorded in the submontane and lowland rain forests. Generally, mushrooms are collected by villagers for domestic consumption only. Collection for sale is very rare (Bandaratillake 1995). Medicines Medicinal plants are collected from the forest for both domestic use and sale. The medical system practised in Sri Lanka is called Ayurveda. This science was developed in India and it has spread to almost all Asian and Southeast Asian countries (Pilipitiya 1995). The flowers, roots, bark and leaves of numerous natural forest plants are used to cure a variety of health problems. About 2 700 plants are mentioned in Ayurvedic books. Bharathie (1994) has listed the most common medicinal plants. Different plant parts are used in medicines (e.g. bark, leaves, seeds and flowers). The largest volume of medicinal plants collected and the highest family income from collection have been recorded from the savannah forests in Bibile (the average family income from collection represents around 70 percent of the total income derived from the collection of all NWFP). Over 60 percent of the villagers are involved in this activity (Bandaratillake 1995). A new industry has developed to produce local pharmaceutical herbal products and there are about 75 manufacturing units in the country (Pilipitiya 1995). Shops selling indigenous medicines and herbal preparations are common in both rural and urban areas (Bandaratillake 1995). No systematic large-scale cultivation of medicinal plants exists as yet (Pilipitiya 1995). Many medicinal plants have been overexploited due to the lack of planned management, and as a result, many herbal medicines that could be grown in Sri Lanka are now imported at a cost of about SL Rs.1 000/kg (Bharathie 1994). Average annual income from the collection of medicinal plants in savannah forests and other forest types ranges from SL Rs.20 000-25 000 and SL Rs.3 000-8 000 respectively (Bandaratillake 1998). Medicinal plants are exported from Sri Lanka to several countries and the value of exports in 1999 amounted to SL Rs.116 million (US$1.7 million). The import of medicinal plants to Sri Lanka in 1999 was about SL Rs.66 million (US$943 000). In 1993 the value of exports was US$2 million. Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials The uses of rattan range from housing construction material (for wattle and daub houses), raw material for furniture and artifacts, small wood needs, house and kitchen utensils and other uses 168 such as roping material. At present some rattan is imported due to the shortage in raw material from natural forests (Bandaratillake 1998). In Sri Lanka, rattan comes primarily from the natural forests. The native species (De Zoysa and Vivekanandan 1991). According to surveys conducted in formulating the Master Plan for Handicraft Development in Sri Lanka (1987), about 2 100 to 2 200 persons earned their primary family income (over one-third of their income) from the rattan craft industry. Full-time and part-time workers are nearly equal in number. A study carried out by the Forest Department (Epitawatta 1994) indicates that in almost every village near the wet zone forests, 20 to 60 percent of villagers collect rattan either for commercial purposes or for their own subsistence consumption. Only in some dry zone areas (e.g. Dimbulagala), do more than half of all villagers earn substantial income from rattan collection and cottage industry production. Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa and Ampara districts are the main rattan-producing districts in the dry zone. Average annual income from rattan for people involved in Polonnaruwa District ranges from SL Rs.20 000 to 30 000 per household (Bandaratillake 1998). The main marketing channels for rattan craft products are handicraft and furniture shops in the major cities of Sri Lanka. Due to small-scale production, craft workers lack capital and very often they depend on middlemen for marketing. Rattan furniture and handicrafts are also manufactured and sold in a rattan craft village called Weweldeniya (land of rattan) (Bandaratillake 1995). Rattan products are exported to seven countries and the value of exports in 1993 was SL Rs.1.5 million (US$20 000). The export of rattan products has declined during recent years because of the shortage of raw material and the poor quality of products. However, the value of imports of rattan in 1993 was SL Rs.2.4 million (US$32 000) which exceeds the value of exports of rattan products. Rattan exports have increased during recent years after the government's decision in 1996 to waiver the import duties on timber and rattan as a strategy for the conservation of forest resources in the country. In addition to its major use as a construction material, bamboo is used in the production of furniture and domestic utensils such as baskets and ornamental items. In the construction industry, bamboo is used for scaffolding and for construction of temporary structures, water lines, and fences. Bamboo is very effective in reducing stream and river bank erosion, and commonly is planted for this purpose. The traditional industry of basketware and bamboo flutes is based almost exclusively on a single native species, other local species used to produce crude basketware. Four widely in cottage industries (Bharathie 1994). According to surveys carried out during the formulation of the Master Plan for Handicraft Development in Sri Lanka (1987), the number of workers engaged in bamboo craft production is fewer than those engaged in rattan production (Bandaratillake 1995). According to De Zoysa and and Vevekandan (1991) 330 workers worked full-time and 364 part-time in the bamboo industry, with varying incomes. Exudates There are several tree species in Sri Lankan forests from which gums and resins are The resin obtained from the latter is used widely in Sri Lanka to treat diabetes. Gum obtained from kaju ( Anacardium occidentale ) is used locally as an adhesive. Kaju is planted widely as an export crop for its nuts, but few trees occur naturally in the forests. Another gum, locally used as an adhesive, is kohomba gum ( Azadiracta indica ( Pinus caribaea ) raised in forest plantations is now entering the export market. Except for pine resin, none of the other gums and resins is collected on a large scale. Damar resins are produced by various species of dipterocarps. The best known product, dorana oil, is obtained from the dorana tree ( Dipterocarpus glandulosus ). This oil mixed with other organic substances was used to paint murals in ancient temples in Sri Lanka (Bharathie 1994). Kekuna ( Canarium zeylaicum ) produces an oleoresin that is collected in small quantities and is used as incense. When distilled, kekuna oleoresin yields phyllandrin which is exported (Bharathie 1994). Dipterocarpus and Canarium species have been exploited heavily for timber in the wet evergreen forests of Sri Lanka. Of the dipterocarps, only about one tree per hectare with a diameter greater than 120 cm can be found in natural forests from which damar resin can be extracted (Bharathie 1994). Others Forest tree leaves are used widely in Oriental medical treatment. A few are also used as wrappers and as leaf vegetables. The most important species and their uses are: bidi leaf ( ) to distill oil that contains cineole (Bharathie 1994). ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS Honey and beeswax Three types of beehives are identified by their locations: in the cavities of large trees, in termite mounds and among rocks (FD/IUCN 1995). Generally honey collection is more significant in moist monsoon, dry monsoon and savannah forest types than in other forest types. Only a few people (about 3-4 percent) in a village are involved in this activity. The average collection in the dry monsoon and savannah forests is about 50 bottles/ household/year and the income range is around SL Rs.3 000-5 000 per household/year. Bee honey is sold at village fairs by the collectors or by the members of their families, but sometimes it is accumulated and sold to middlemen. Bushmeat According to the current Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, hunting of any animal in wildlife reserves and sanctuaries, and hunting of protected animals in other forests, is prohibited. Despite these legal restrictions, villagers in peripheral areas still use bushmeat to supplement their diets. The percentage of villagers who engage in hunting is greater in the dry zone (about 50 to 60 percent) than in the wet zone (about 6 to 10 percent). More than 80 percent of the villagers engaged in hunting, hunt either for family consumption or for sale. Others hunt to protect their 170 crops from wild animals. Villagers use two methods of hunting game - guns and traditional methods. Hunters use shot guns, muzzle loaders and trap guns. Traditional hunting methods include various types of traps and using hunting dogs. The method varies with the type of animal being hunted (Bandaratillake 1995). The most common animal hunted in all regions is the wild boar ( Sus scrofa ). Other animals commonly hunted in the dry zone are spotted deer ( small animals such as monkeys, giant squirrels, porcupines and jungle fowl are consumed by villagers. A high proportion of large animals like wild boar, sambhur and deer are sold. Although the sale of bushmeat is prohibited by law, there is a very high demand for this meat in urban areas. As a result, many of the large animals, other than wild boar, are threatened with extinction due to hunting. In some areas, the numbers of monkeys and deer are diminishing rapidly (FD/IUCN 1995). Large areas of forest and forest plantations are also destroyed every year as the result of careless use of fire to trap animals (Bandaratillake 1995). Although only few people (3 to 4 percent) in villages of peripheral areas are involved in hunting as a livelihood, they receive a high income from this activity. A recent survey in some of the dry zone protected areas showed that their incomes from hunting and sale of bushmeat is around SL Rs.120 000 to 150 000 per year (Bandaratillake 1998). Other edible animal products A significant feature in the southern part of the dry zone, is the sale of milk products, particularly curd, which is in high demand in urban areas (Bandaratillake 1995). In the dry zone apart from milk products, the villagers also sell cattle for meat. The average annual family income from cattle rearing on forest lands in this part of the country is about SL Rs.15 000 to 20 000 (US$150 to 225) whilst this income for large-scale cattle owners is around SL Rs.50 000 to 120 000 (US$550 to 1 300) per year (Bandaratillake 1998). The average annual family income from cattle rearing in the wet zone is reported to be less than SL Rs.9 000 (US$100). The production of milk products and meat is not sufficient for consumption in the country and therefore these products are not exported from Sri Lanka. REFERENCES Bandaratillake, H.M. 1995.

FOREST SERVICES Ecotourism activities in Sri Lanka are concentrated mainly in the following areas: national parks (12) managed by the Department of Wild Life Conservation (DWLC), World Heritage Site (National Heritage and Wilderness Area) and conservation forests (2) managed by the Forest Department (FD). Facilities such as ecolodges, camping sites, nature trails, interpretation centres, guided excursions etc. are available in most of these areas. In addition there are nature reserves (3), strict natural reserves (3), sanctuaries (52) and conservation forests (30) in the network of protected areas. Some of these areas have good potential for development to cater to the ecotourism industry. Currently Sri Lanka is not a popular ecotourism destination for foreign tourists. According to the information available, out of an annual average of 350 000 foreign tourists during the last few years, only about 10 to 12 percent have visited ecotourism facilities. Table 4.

From a home garden or a forest, the villagers gather firewood, leaves, fruits and medicinal plants. The villagers also enjoy watching birds. There are important food items which villagers prepare with plants and leaves as part of the rituals of daily life. These include the taking of herbal gruel in the morning and herbal tea between meals. This traditional habit is said to have ensured the health of Sri Lanka's people in ancient times. Western-qualified doctors are encouraging people to resurrect the ancient practice of having a cup of herbal gruel each day. Many restaurants in Colombo have begun providing herbal gruel for sale on a regular basis (Pilipitiya 1995). Villagers living in the vicinity of forests still use the forests for grazing their cattle. Despite the introduction of tractors, most of the villagers, particularly those in remote areas, still use buffaloes as traction animals for agriculture and they consider cattle-rearing to be an important domestic activity which benefits them economically (Bandaratillake 1995). 173QUANTITATIVE NWFP DATA OF SRI LANKA Product Resource Economic value Category Import- ance Trade name Generic term Species Part used Habitat Source Desti- nation Quantity, value Remarks References 1, 2, 3 F, P, O W, C N, I Plants and plant products Food 1 Kitul Caryota urens sa F, O W, C N Av. value of kitul products from lowland rain forests is around SL Rs.20 000/ha p/a (US$200/ha p/a) Av. household income SL Rs.15 000- 20 000 p/a Bandaratillake 1995 Medicines Medicinal plants Export of SL Rs.116 million (US$1.7 million), import of SL Rs.66 million (US$943 000) in 1999 Av. value of plants p/a: SL Rs.20 000- 25 000 (savannah forests) and SL Rs.3 000-8 000 (other forests) Bandaratillake 1998 Utensils, handicrafts, construction materials 1 Rattan Calamus spp. st F W N, I 1993: export of SL Rs.1.5 million (US$20 000) Import of rattan in 1993: SL Rs.2.4 million (US$32 000) Bandaratillake 1998 Bamboo Export of bamboo and bamboo products: SL Rs.80 000 (US$1 150) and import of SL Rs.55 000 (US$800) in 1999 Villagers collecting bamboo from state forests for basket making have an annual income of about SL Rs.4 000- 8 000/household Bandaratillake 1998; Sri Lanka Custom Report 174 Product Resource Economic value Category Import- ance Trade name Generic term Species Part used Habitat Source Desti- nation Quantity, value Remarks References 1, 2, 3 F, P, O W, C N, I Animals and animal products Honey, beeswax ho F W N Average collection in the dry monsoon and savannah forests: 50/bottles/household p/a, which generates an income of SL Rs.3 000 - 5 000 p/a Bushmeat an F W N Income from the sale of bushmeat in the dry zone: SL Rs.120 000-150 000 p/a Bandaratillake 1995 Grazing an C N Household income in the dry zone: SL Rs.15 000- 20 000 000 p/a(US$550-1 300) for large- scale cattle owners in the same area.

Other NWFP include food and bark for tanning and dyeing. General information In Thailand, NWFP are defined as all products from the forest, excluding wood and other intangible products (Subansenee 1995). Management of NWFP has its legal framework in the Forest Act B.E. 2484 (1941), the Royal Decree (1987) and the Forest Regulation (1989). NWFP are divided into two categories: protected and non-protected NWFP. Neither category may be collected in conservation forests. Protected NWFP may be collected or harvested in small amounts for subsistence needs. Protected NWFP include wild orchids; aromatic resin, and Timber harvesting in the natural forest has been banned since 1989 and the forest products at present are mainly of the non-wood variety. However, there is no resource management. In particular, bamboo, rattan, gum and resin, edible insects and mushrooms are becoming scarce in the forest. The Workshop on Promotion of Tropical NWFP in Thailand in 1999 made a decision to concentrate support on four NWFP: bamboo, rattan, sugar palm ( Arenga pinnata ), medicinal plants and spices.

It is difficult to obtain data on the actual production of NWFP, because most harvesting is done illegally. Since agricultural lands are very limited, many villagers depend on NWFP gathering (e.g. bamboo, mushrooms, edible and medicinal plants and sugar palm). NWFP in Thailand serve as food and as a source of income and also provide rural employment and foreign exchange. PLANTS AND PLANT PRODUCTS Food There are over 500 species of edible forest plants sold in Thai markets. They include fruits, nuts, leaves, bark and shoots. In the rainy season in northeast Thailand, food from forests can account for half of the food consumed by some rural villagers. Edible products also bring extra income (Subansenee 1995). Edible plants Mushrooms are found in forests throughout the country. Some favourite mushroom varieties are Termitomyces sp. and Russula delica, sold for B80 to 120/kg (US$3.20 to 4.80/kg). Many edible mushrooms also act as an ectomycorrhiza, helping trees to take up phosphorus. Thus, mushrooms can be both a cash crop, and a means of improving tree growth in plantations (Subansenee 1995). Edible bamboo shoots are popular in both fresh and preserved food (Subansenee 1995). Bamboo species for shoot production include pai tong Dendrocalamus Gigantochloa albociliata ). Shoot harvesting occurs from May to October (the rainy season). In bamboo plantations, Dendrocalamus asper plants of one to two years can give five or six shoots each year. About 20 percent of the shoot production is consumed fresh, while 80 percent is processed for canning (Subansenee 1995). Table 2.

Normally, they collect the rattan from the wild but farmers are now starting to plant rattan for shoots. The most popular species siamensis ) (Subansenee edible shoots. Consumption of rattan shoots is the best alternative utilization of rattan in Thailand. Edible rattan shoots increase farmers' incentives to establish rattan plantations. Instead of waiting for cane production for over six to seven years, 177farmers can manage early utilization of rattan shoots within the second year of cultivation. Rattan shoots have now become a popular dish in Thailand, especially in the north and northeast, as well as in Lao PDR and Viet Nam. Sugar palm ( Arenga pinnata ) is a multipurpose species. It is known mainly for its sap for sugar making and as a provider of edible starch from the trunk. The fruit cooked in syrup is a favourite Thai dessert. Sugar palm fruit is one of the most important edible plants but is becoming very rare due to unsustainable harvesting. Thailand has to import the products from other countries. Medicines Over 800 species of medicinal plants are described in Thai traditional recipes. About 400 species are available in traditional drug stores and about 51 species are used in the traditional medicine industry.

Low-grade material is used to distil the volatile agar attar oil used in the perfume and tobacco industries. High-grade material is exported to Arabian countries where it is used as incense and, when powdered, in the manufacture of joss sticks. The ground wood is also used as a stimulant, a tonic and a sedative. It is an ingredient in several medicinal preparations against rheumatism, body pains and heart palpitations. The price of agarwood can reach almost US$200/kg depending on the wood grade (Subansenee 1995). 178Kobuak powder is obtained by grinding the bark of Persea spp. and all parts (except the leaves) of Cinnamomum inners (Sial 1995).

Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials Thailand has 60 species of bamboo in 13 appears in mixed deciduous forests (Subansenee 1995). There has not been any particular inventory of bamboo resources in Thailand. In 1988, bamboo covered about 5.5 percent (8 100 000 ha) of the forest area (148 600 000 ha) of Thailand (Subansenee 1995). More recent satellite imagery (LANDSAT TM taken in January/February 1991) combined with field mapping revealed that bamboos were found over an area of 32.83 million rai (5 525 800 ha)3. The important commercial bamboos in Thailand for construction work and supporting poles include pai liang ( B. nana G. hasskariana ); important species for basketry and B. also cultivated. The area of bamboo plantations expanded rapidly during the first half of the 1990s (Pungbun Na Ayudhya 2000). According to Subansenee (1995) all rattans were brought under protection in 1987 because overexploitation had depleted the resource. Permits from the Royal Forest Department (RFD) are required for harvesting. There are more than 60 species of rattan in Thailand occurring in swamp, evergreen, dry evergreen and mixed deciduous forests at elevations up to 1 000 m asl. The most important large stem rattans in Thailand used furniture Besides cane production, some species of rattan produce edible shoots. Exudates Thailand has about 27 plants which produce gums and resins. They are used mostly to satisfy the subsistence needs of rural people. Two important Thai resins are gum oleoresin ( Pinus gambodge from Garcinia hanburyi Hook.f., Chinese lacquer from dipterocarps (Subansenee 1995). Table 7.

In addition, A. melifera has been introduced for beekeeping (Subansenee 1995). Other products than honey obtained from bees are wax, pollen, royal jelly, propolis, venom and bees themselves. The current production, prices and demand are difficult to estimate. Beekeeping became more popular in Thailand during the 1980s. In 1990, there were about 77 000 hives in Thailand. It is estimated that annual national honey production from beekeeping is about 2 000 tonnes (Subansenee 1995). In 1994, honey exports were 1 94.4 tonnes (26.9 millon baht). 180Table 8.

Other non-edible animal products Thailand is the second largest lac-producing country after India. The world production of lac is about 30 000 tonnes of which Thailand's proportion is 40 percent. The production of lac fluctuates depending on weather conditions and the world market price. From 1984 to 1994 production has averaged 6 000 tonnes annually (Subansenee 1995). The largest lac-producing areas are in the north and northeast. There are many trees and shrubs that can host the lac insect ( Laccifer lacca ). The major lac Thailand is the raintree (Samanea saman Merr). Other lac can be cropped twice a year, in practice it is done only once, from November to January (Subansenee 1995). Table 9.

General information Besides timber, the forests in Viet Nam provide a wide range of NWFP which are commonly referred to as \"Special Forest Products\" (Lauong Van Tien 1994). NWFP play an important subsistence role for rural households, particularly of the ethnic minorities living in upland areas where about 54 ethnic groups with around 150 subgroups have been found (Smithsonian 1991). NWFP can yield higher economic returns than the upland agriculture or the forest products of this area. The NWFP sector (collection, cultivation, trade and processing) in Viet Nam affords employment to hundreds of thousands of people, including the inhabitants of urban areas (Lauong Van Tien 1991). NWFP exports reached US$40 million annually between 1986 and 1990 (NTFP Project Document 2000). People moving from the rural areas tend to maintain their consumption patterns in the cities and the urbanization of the population has increased the demand for NWFP. The trade is in the hands of various state and provincial companies and a number of small private traders (NTFP Project 1999). Before 1995, the State Enterprises controlled all the marketing chains of NWFP. Currently, deregulation and more free market access for NWFP is taking place. The lack of value-added processing reduces the incomes from NWFP. Many harvesters sell NWFP unprocessed because they either need money immediately or because of insufficient knowledge of processing techniques (NTFP Project 2000). NWFP are domesticated by households in home gardens and agroforestry systems. Some NWFP plantations (production forest and protection forest) have been developed under the management of the State Forest Enterprises (STEs) but there is no systematic management of NWFP development in Viet Nam. Forest decline and other factors are leading in many locations to overexploitation of NWFP resources. According to the Biodiversity Action Plan (1995) about 28 percent of animal species, 10 percent of bird species and 21 percent of reptiles and amphibians, are facing extinction, while some 350 plant species are among the endangered species.

According to the 5MHRP plans, in 2010 Viet Nam could have more than one million hectares of NWFP plantations and other types of NWFP forests. The forest cover has been increased from 23.6 percent in 1983 to 33.2 percent in 2000 (MARD 2000). This is a result of the new reforms, which have opened opportunities for local communities to improve their forest resources and which have given them new possibilities to generate more income from NWFP. According to the Forest Strategy Group (December 2000), it has been forecast that from 2001 to 2010 Viet Nam will need 300-350 000 tonnes of rattan and bamboo; 40 000 tonnes of pine resin; 30 000 tonnes of anise flower; 5 000 tonnes of shellac; 1 000 tonnes of dipterocarpus sap and 1.5 000 tonnes of medicinal plants. PLANTS AND PLANT PRODUCTS Food Cao Bang and Bac Giang provinces. In Cao Bang Province there are 2 000 ha of intensively cultivated chestnut trees that can provide cash income for farmers (Huy 1996). In the mountain areas, mushrooms (e.g. nam Ganoderm lucidum )) are used mostly as subsistence for other food. Mushroom cultivation has become more popular both in uplands and lowlands as it has provided many farmers with new ways for income generation. There were around 100 000 households cultivating straw mushrooms ( Volvariella volvacea ) in Viet Nam, employing 300 000 people on a permanent basis, mainly in South Viet Nam (VFFSCP 1997). Annually more than 100 000 tonnes of mushrooms can be produced and this has attracted about 1 million households to become involved in this new profession (Thu Hanh 2001). Table 2.

For instance Ha Noi City needs 300 tonnes of fresh mushrooms annually. The whole country needs about 160 000 tonnes per year (Le Vo Dinh Tuong 2001). More than 40 per cent of the Vietnamese mushrooms are exported to the United States, Japan, Taiwan, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Canada (Hien Anh 2001). 187Bamboo shoots are used as food. Production of bamboo shoots reached 32 500 tonnes in 1995, 30 887 tonnes in 1996 and 13 789 tonnes in 1997 (Ministry of Agricultural Rural Development Vietnam [MARD] 2000); Chu 2001). Medicines Around 4 000 different types of medicines ranging from traditional herbal cures to modern remedies introduced from the west are produced in Viet Nam. The low productivity and obsolete technology of the Vietnamese pharmaceutical industries can currently meet only 30 percent of the total demand, while 70 percent of the domestic demand has to be supplied by imports (VFFSCP 1997). A study by the Medicinal Institute found that more than 2 000 trees species (238 plant families) are famed for their medicinal properties; they are common in folk medicines and should be protected. Some species under the threat of extinction are Coptis chinensis and C. quiquesecta (hoang la), Panax spp. (tam that) (Nguyen Tap 2001). About 300 species are harvested for domestic and commercial purposes (including domesticated medicinal trees). Valuable plants include Acathopanax spp. (ngu gia bi gai), Schefflera spp. (ngu gia bi chan chim), Polygonum multiflorum (ha Cibotium barometz (cau tich) (Nguyen Tap 2001). It has been estimated that 80-90 percent of the medicinal plants produced in northern Viet Nam are exported in the form of dried plants or extracts and that only 10-20 percent of the medicinal plants are consumed or processed domestically (Lecup 1996).

In Viet Nam there are three important species of cardamom (local name sa nhan, trade name wild T.L.Wu (local name sa nhan tim). 188More than 80 percent of the cardamom production is gathered from the wild with the remainder being cultivated (Tu 1990). The quality of the products is, however, higher in the plantation forests since in the wild the fruits are often collected too early as the collectors are afraid that other collectors will harvest the products before them. The harvesting season is in June and July. Cardamom is exported mainly to Asian countries (China, Japan and Hong Kong). In 1999 to 2000, Viet Nam exported about 8 000 kg of cardamom to China (Kham 2001). In 1995, 17 800 kg (US$143 880) were exported to Japan (VFFSCP 1997). In the domestic market, the fresh fruits are sold at D5 000-6 000/kg (US$0.3-0.4/kg). The price for dried fruits can be 10 times higher since 10 kg of fresh fruits is equal to 1 kg of dried fruits (ratio 1/10), from US$3.5-4.0/kg (Tu 2000). Anise star tree ( Illicium verum Hook) (trade name anise, local name hoi huong) grows mainly in Lang Son Province but is also found in other provinces such as Bac Kan, Thai Nguyen, Cao Bang, Quang Ninh. In Lang Son Province, anise has been planted in the districts of Van Lang, Van Quang, Tay Bac, Cao Loc, Binh Gia, Nam Truong Dinh and Bac Son. The area of plantations in Lang Son Province is more than 9 000 ha, the majority being in Van Quan District (7 021 ha). The district of Van Quan produced 3 000 tonnes (more than D70 billion [US$5 million]) in 2000 (Vietnam News 2001). In the past, anise plantations mostly belonged to the collectives and the SFEs. From the 1990s onwards, the collectives and the SFEs were disestablished and the anise plantations were allocated for management by households. Within the framework of the 5MHRP, some 20 000 ha of new plantations are planned. Table 4.

Harvesting fruit during the summer season provides bigger yields (Tan 1996). Due to the high quality of Vietnamese anise seeds, the Chinese producers buy Vietnamese anise in order to upgrade their quality and then re-export the blended anise to international markets. Table 5.

Cinnamon has been introduced to a number of provinces such as Phu Tho, Tuyen Dinh and Khanh Hoa. Cinnamon has high potential in the provinces of Cao Bang, Thanh Hoa and Quang Nam. Currently the area is 16 000 ha, which can provide more than 3 000 tonnes of bark per year (Hoang Cau 2000); 65 000 ha of cinnamon should be planted from 2000 to 2010 according to the 5MHRP. The incense made from eaglewood ( Lignum Aquilaria crassna . Partly due to the extinction of the species in natural forests, more than 700 ha of Aquilaria crassna have been planted by farmers. Most planting areas are in Huong Khe District, Ha Tinh Province; Dong Hoi District, Quang Binh Province; Tra Province; Dong Xoai District, Binh Phuoc Province. In 1995, the export of eaglewood to Japan was 34 071 kg (US$6 046 091) (VFFSCP 1997). In 1999 and 2000 Viet Nam exported 2 000 kg of eaglewood to Japan and China (Kham 2001). The quality of Vietnamese eaglewood is acknowledged widely in world markets (Tissari 1997). In the near future, 155 000 ha of the tung oil tree (Aleurites montana ) will be planted in new areas following the 5MHRP. Currently tung oil trees have been planted mostly in Lai Chau, Hoa Binh, Quang Nam Da Nang, Lang Son and Quang Ninh provinces (Viet 1996). Utensils, handicrafts and construction materials Rattan and bamboo are important raw materials for the handicraft industry, which employs at least 2 to 3 million people in Viet Nam (VFFSCP 1997). According to Lan Anh (2001) the handicraft business has employed around one million unskilled workers. Each US$1 million earned from handicraft exports can generate jobs for roughly 3 000 to 4 000 workers in the handicraft villages (Thu Hanh 2001). The main destinations for finished handicraft products made from bamboo and rattan are Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States and the European Union. In 1998, the value of the total forest production was US$59.0 million and of this amount the value of handicraft exports was US$37.7 million (Huan 2000). Table 10.

This favourable economic development is supposed to continue. Viet Nam is the third largest exporter of rattan in the world after Malaysia and Indonesia (around 19114 percent of the world rattan trade in 1992). The value of exports ranges between US$36 million (1990) and US$12.6 million (1995). However, up to 60 percent of the raw rattan cane in Viet Nam is imported. Table 12.

Uncontrolled rattan harvesting for many years has led to the extinction of rattan resources. In order to support the growing handicraft industry, the government is encouraging the cultivation of rattan. In Thai Binh, Hai Duong, Ha Tinh and Nam Ha provinces rattan has been planted in home gardens for centuries as a multipurpose tree. Annually farmers can produce some 1 500 to 2 000 tonnes from their home gardens. Nowadays rattan markets have been liberalized and are operated by private traders, primary processing factories and exporters along with state-controlled export companies. Few secondary processing activities are conducted in Viet Nam for the local market and in general most of the exported products are in the primary processed form. The secondary processing in furniture and other home appliances is done usually by the importing countries (Lecup 1996). Annually some 20 000 to 40 000 people are involved in rattan exploitation and processing, which makes the industry an important contributor to employment (Dung 2001). According to the Forest Inventory Planning Institute (FIPI) (1993), the area of both bamboo plantations and natural bamboo forests in Viet Nam is 896 391 ha and more than 200 000 ha should be planted in the near future following the 5MHRP guidelines. Important bamboo species in Viet Nam include harvested mostly for their shoots. Table 13.

The volume of bamboo supplied to the pulp industry is as high as 100 000 tonnes per year. Bamboo processing developed rapidly from 1990 to 1995. Nationwide, some 20 mill firms have been established (Chu 2000). Exudates Pine resin ( Pinus merkusii ) (local name thong nhua) grows in natural forest and has been planted over large areas in the provinces of Quang Ninh, Bac Kan, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Lam Dong. According to data from MARD (1992) Viet Nam has 120 000 ha of pine resin plantations. According to 5MHRP, from 2000 to 2010, some 140 000 ha of Pinus merkussi should be planted (MARD 2000). Table 14.

Some quantities are produced by Apis cerana , Apis florea and Apis trigona . About 200 to 400 tonnes of forest honey per year are marketed and pure forest honey has a much better price on the domestic market because of its good taste and the medicinal qualities that are ascribed to it (de Beer 1993). Some honey has been produced by raising the European honey bee ( Apis melifera ). According to Viet Nam's Central Bee Company (VCBC), Viet Nam has around 350 000 bee hives, mainly in the Central Highlands and also in a number of northern and southern provinces. They yield around 8 000 tonnes of honey and hundreds of tonnes of wax annually. During the first half of 2001 the VCBC exported more than 4 000 tonnes of honey (an increase of 1 000 tonnes compared to the previous year). The price for the honey exported is 10 percent higher than during 2000. Exports of honey have increased compared to the export levels of 1995. Viet Nam's honey is exported to the European Union, Japan, the United States, ASEAN countries and Taiwan (Vietnam News 2001). Table 15.

It is remarkable that 11 of the 79 species of birds and 10 of 77 193species of mammals traded in Viet Nam have been declared rare or endangered (Le Dien Duc 1997). The hunting and poaching of any animal without a permit has been banned since 1973 and species threatened with extinction have been recommended to be banned from commercial trade (Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment [MOSTE] 1992). Another law was passed in 1992 prohibiting the sales and export of 45 species and restricting the trade in another 15 species (Donovan 1998). Medicines In the central coastal province of Ha Tinh, farmers have for many decades raised spotted deer Cervus nippon (local name huong sao) to sell its antlers for Chinese medicine. The antlers, which can be harvested annually, earn D2.5 million (US$250) per set. Keeping a male deer is therefore as profitable as cultivating one hectare of rice. Deer breeding can generate more profits but requires a heavy initial investment (a three-month-old deer costs D25 million (US$2 500). Other non-edible animal products Lac (trade name shellac or sticklac, local name canh kien do) is the resinous secretion from the body of the insect, Laccifer lacca . Before the 1990s, lac resin had the potential to generate income for minorities in the northwest of Viet Nam. The amount of lac exported annually is about 350 tonnes (Chu 1996). There are two seasons for harvesting lac resin: autumn (March to September) and spring (September to March). The host trees can be found in the wild, in home gardens and in plantations. Host trees suitable for lac cultivation in Viet Nam include co phen ( Protium Anh huong dieu kien khi hau voi chu ky mat mua trong san xuat canh. Bieu, Tran Gia. 1981.

FOREST SERVICES Special-Use Forests play an important role in forest protection and biodiversity conservation of Viet Nam, and cover an area of more than 1 million ha. The system extends protection to a variety of different ecosystems, and endangered plant and animal species (Nguyen Huy Phon 2000). The Vietnamese Red Data Book has been published by the Government of Viet Nam in two volumes. The first is devoted to presenting 347 endangered animal species and the second to some 350 rare and endangered plant species. Annually these areas receive more than 80 000 visitors. Popular tourist destinations include: /circle6 Cuc Phuong National Park in Ninh Binh Province receives around 40 000 visitors per year, most of whom are domestic tourists. Cuc Phuong National Park is an important site for biological research and for training scientists. Many undergraduate and graduate students visit the national park on field courses. /circle6 Hoang Lien Son-Sa Pa Nature Reserve in Lao Cai Province contains many species of plants that are used as medicines, ornaments, food or for timber. /circle6 Dao Cat Ba Proposed Marine Protected Area and Cat Ba National Park in Quang Ninh Province. /circle6 Muong Phang Cultural and Historical Site belongs Lai Chau Province. The site currently attracts about 50 visitors per month, including both domestic and foreign tourists. /circle6 Ba Vi National Park in Ha Tay Province is an import source of forest products for local communities. Medicinal plant collection is among the major economic activities in the area. In 1997/1998, around 250 tonnes of medicinal plants were extracted from the national park. /circle6 Bach Ma National Park in Hua Thien Hue Province. /circle6 Cat Tien National Park in Dong Nai, Lam Dong Province receives a growing number of domestic tourists. The national park has gained popularity among foreign birdwatchers (BirdLife International 2001). 197QUANTITATIVE NWFP DATA OF VIET NAM Product Resource Economic value Category Import -ance Trade name Generic term Species Part used Habitat Source Desti- nation Quantity, value Remarks References 1, 2, 3 F, P, O W, C N, I Plants and plant products 1 Mushrooms Ganoderma lucidum Auricularia auricula Lentinus edodes W, C N, I 1995: export of 896 192 kg (US$1 881 963) Export of 40 000 MT + p/a 2000: value of mushroom exports: US$8 million Demand in Ha Noi City p/a: 300 MT of fresh mushrooms Domestic demand for mushrooms p/a: 160 000 MT Bach 2000; Hung mollissima fr F, P W, C N.
