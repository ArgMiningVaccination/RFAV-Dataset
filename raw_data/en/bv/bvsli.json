Some point to the substantive standards for patentability.8 They contend that in a well-functioning patent system, patents like those described above would have been screened out as lacking novelty, nonobviousness, or utility. 9 Their cries for reform have been heard by the Supreme Court. Recent decisions have either narrowed the scope and strength of patent rights or made it easier to challenge questionable patents. 10 1 See generally JAMES BESSEN & MICHAEL J.

But see Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. 966 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 But adjusting the substantive standards of patentability alone does not solve the problem since questionable patents continue to emerge from the PTO. Some scholars attribute this to the agency's inner workings and policy choices. For example, there was a point in time when the agency's self-declared mission was to \"help [its] customers get patents.\" 11 Even if that is no longer explicitly stated, scholars argue that the agency's administrative structure, personnel policies, and incentive system for examiners compromise patent quality. 12 Recent scholarship suggests that the PTO has an incentive to grant numerous patents for its own interests 13 and to reduce its well-publicized backlog of applications.14 Drawing attention to what happens inside the PTO is clearly the correct locus. However, any serious headway toward improving patent quality must focus more directly on patent examination. It is the key facet of patent prosecution \u2014 the process by which an inventor, usually through the help of an attorney, files an application with the PTO for review. 15 Upon filing, a patent examiner evaluates it for compliance with statutory patentability criteria and negotiates with the applicant over the scope of the exclusionary right that will be P'ship, 131 S.

Beth Simone Noveck advocates a paradigm in which external reviewers with relevant knowledge about the subject matter participate in patent examination by submitting information and comments on patentability. 19 John Thomas also advocates for a regime that would engage private citizens to provide information pertinent to patentability but would offer them a cash prize for doing so. 20 Doug Lichtman and Mark Lemley argue that applicants should \"earn\" the presumption of patent validity21 only if they submit their patent applications to a rigorous review.22 John Golden suggests that the examiner's burden could be reduced by work sharing with foreign patent offices 23 or privatizing or automating application review.24 Michael Meurer argues that the PTO should set examination priorities so that applications claiming inventions in certain technologies receive more scrutiny than others, 25 and tailor examination so that examiners spend more time focusing on patentability standards that are easy to 16 The process is discussed infra Part I.A. 17 See Michael Carley et al., What Is the Probability of Receiving a U.S. Patent? , 17 YALE J.L. & TECH. 203, 209-10 (2015) (exploring allowance rates for applications filed from 1996-2005 and finding an allowance rate of 71.2% if continuation procedures were used and 55.8% otherwise); Christopher A.

And it is not clear that any of these proposals would discourage frivolous filings. This Article takes a very different approach to improving patent examination. My basic claim is that low-quality patents issue not simply because of poor decision-making or policy choices by the PTO but because of a confluence of three asymmetries that exist in the current patent examination paradigm. First, the presumption that anyone who files a patent application is entitled to a patent gives rise to a proof asymmetry in patent examination because an examiner who challenges patentability faces the dual burdens of building a prima facie case of unpatentability and carrying the ultimate burden of proof. 27 This asymmetry causes considerable mischief because the combined effect of the presumption of patentability and the presumption that the PTO only issues valid patents raises serious quality concerns. 28 Second, an information deficit exists in patent examination because it is hard to believe that everything that the applicant knows about the invention ends up before the examiner. This information asymmetry inevitably allows bad patents to slip through the cracks and further contributes to the patent quality problem. 29 Third, that most examiners lack formal legal training gives rise to a legal asymmetry in patent examination. Given the proof asymmetry and the examiner's incentives and time pressures,30 I contend that the legal asymmetry allows savvy applicants to craft legal arguments, which lead the examiner to acquiesce and, consequently, issue a patent. 31 The interplay between these asymmetries and the concomitant negative effect on patent quality have not been recognized or explored in the scholarly literature. This Article proceeds in three parts. Part I briefly explores the theory of patent examination and describes how patent examination affects patent quality. Part II analyzes the three asymmetries and explains how individually and together they tip the scales of patentability in favor of the applicant. Finally, Part III offers a new patent examination paradigm, which remediates the asymmetries and rebalances the scales of patentability. 26 Id. at 707-08. 27 See infra Part II.A. 28 See infra Part I.A. 29 Part II.B. 30 See supra note infra 31 See infra Part II.C. 2016] Patent Asymmetries 969 I. U NDERSTANDING PATENT EXAMINATION A. Theoretical Framework The Intellectual Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution empowered Congress to create a patent system, which would promote technological progress. 32 Pursuant to that authority, Congress enacted the Patent Act of 1790,33 which gave examining duties to three presidential cabinet members known as the \"patent board.\"34 Three years later, Congress replaced examination with a registration-only system, which essentially awarded a patent to anyone who filed an application on anything.35 Validity issues were left to the courts.36 The flaws of this regime led Congress to enact the Patent Act of 1836,37 which reverted back to a substantive pre-issuance examination system but with professional examiners within an agency now known as the PTO. 38 The agency is charged \"with the task of examining patent applications . . . and issuing patents if 'it appears that the applicant is entitled to a patent under the law.'\" 39 Patent examination is an ex parte proceeding between the applicant and the examiner.40 The former is often represented by an attorney.41 The examiner is a quasi-judicial 32 The Clause's stated goal is \"[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to . . . Inventors the exclusive Right to their U.S. CONST . art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8; see also Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U.S. 502, 511 (1917) (\"[T]he primary purpose of our patent laws . . . is 'to promote the progress of science and useful arts.'\" (citation omitted)). 33 See Patent Act of 1790, ch. 7, 1 Stat. 109, 110-12 (repealed 1793). 34 The board consisted of the Secretary of State (then Thomas Jefferson), Secretary of War (then Henry Knox), and Attorney General (then Edmund Randolph).

Raymond, 31 U.S. 218, 241 (1832) (explaining that patent issuance was a ministerial duty which afforded the Secretary of State \"no judgment on the question [of] whether the patent shall be issued\"); Edward C.

Ct. 2238, 2242 (2011) See DURHAM , supra note 15, \u00a7 5.1 (explaining the process). 41 See id. 970 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 official42 (typically a non-lawyer)43 with expertise in a specific technological field. The examiner's principal task is to evaluate the patent application for compliance with the patentability requirements found in Title 35 of the United States Code. In short, the invention must be useful, 44 novel,45 nonobvious,46 and fall into one of the categories of patentable subject matter.47 In addition, the application must adequately describe, enable, and set forth the best mode of carrying out the invention; 48 and conclude with claims49 that delineate the (scope of the) invention with particularity.50 Gauging patentability requires the examiner to search the so-called \"prior art\" \u2014 preexisting knowledge and technology already available to the public. 51 Examination proceeds through multiple stages of communication between the examiner and the applicant.52 Upon initial review on the merits, the examiner typically issues one or more rejections articulating why one or more claims are unpatentable. 53 The applicant can respond by amending the claims or offering proof or persuasive argument challenging the examiner's rejection. 54 Upon the examiner's reconsideration, the claim is either allowed, further amended, 42 Western Elec. Co. v. Piezo Tech., Inc., 860 F.2d 428, 431 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (\"[I]t was intended that the Commissioner of Patents, in issuing or withholding patents . . . should exercise quasi-judicial functions, is apparent from the nature of the examinations and decision he is required to make.\" (quoting Butterworth v.

Co., 128 U.S. 315, 363 (1888) (explaining that patent examination is \" quasi judicial in its character\"). 43 The PTO provides examiners with rudimentary legal training on topics relevant to patent examination.

Patent claim language describes the invention's boundaries like a deed to real property. See supra note 49. 51 See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 (2012) (defining the documents and activities that can serve as prior art). The invention is compared to the prior art in assessing novelty and nonobviousness. 52 4 D ONALD S. CHISUM , CHISUM See re Packard, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1992). 2016] Patent Asymmetries 971 cancelled, or remains rejected.55 The response-reconsideration process typically proceeds through several iterations and concludes with the allowed claims issuing as a patent. 56 As for the rejected claims, the applicant can cancel them (and perhaps pursue them in a continuation application),57 request continued examination,58 or appeal.59 Viewing the examiner as a government employee who grants patents purely for the sake of granting patents reveals an incorrect understanding of the process. Irrespective of the examiner, the current examination regime itself strongly favors patent issuance. 60 At the outset, an applicant enjoys a presumption of patentability,61 which means that at the time of filing the application is rebuttably presumed to comply with the utility, novelty, nonobviousness, and disclosure requirements of the patent statute.62 Thus, the PTO must issue a patent 55 37 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.111-.113 (2015). An applicant may choose to pursue the cancelled claims in a second application. See infra note 57. 56 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.311 (2015) (instructing examiners to issue a notice of allowance for claims entitled to a patent). 57 An applicant may cancel claims without prejudice and pursue them in a new application called a \"continuation\" application as long as the latter is filed before the original application issues as a patent. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 (2012); 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.53(b) (2015). For commentary on the use of continuation practice to delay patent prosecution, see Mark A. Lemley & Kimberly A. Moore, Ending Abuse of Patent Continuations , 84 B.U. L. REV. 63, 71-83 (2004). 58 After prosecution closes, the applicant can pay for additional examination when the examiner would otherwise not provide it; meaning that prosecution of a previously pending application reopens. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 132(b) (2012). A request for continued examination (\"RCE\") requires payment of a fee as well as \"an amendment to the written description, claims, or drawings, new arguments, or new evidence in support of patentability.\" 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.114 (2015). 59 An applicant whose claims have been twice rejected by the examiner can appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\"PTAB\") which, among other things, reviews adverse decisions of examiners. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6(b), 134(a) (2012). The PTAB can affirm a rejection or reverse and remand to the examining corps. 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.50 (2015). A dissatisfied applicant can appeal to the Federal Circuit or file a civil action in the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 141, 145 (2012). In the latter, the applicant can submit evidence not considered by the PTO during prosecution. Kappos v. Hyatt, 132 S. Ct. 1690, 1700-01 (2012). See infra notes 222-24 and accompanying text (discussing appellate procedures). 60 See Sean B. Seymore, The Presumption of Patentability , 97 M INN. L.

U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321-329 (2012)) \u2014 trials conducted by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. In both proceedings the petitioner need only prove patent invalidity by a preponderance of evidence rather than the (higher) clear and convincing evidence standard applied in litigation. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 316(e), 326(e) (2012). However, both mechanisms are quite limited. For example, for both IPR and PGR, the petition must be filed soon after patent issuance. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 311(c), 321(c). For IPR, only novelty and nonobviousness may be challenged. Id. \u00a7 311(b). In addition, the filing fees for both mechanisms are relatively high (and can be prohibitively expensive for patents having a large number of claims). See 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.15 (2015) (describing the fee schedule). Finally, it is unlikely that either mechanism will invalidate a sufficient number of patents to make a substantial contribution to improving patent quality. Cf. R.

First, there was a surge in the number of unoriginal, duplicative, and frivolous patent applications. G USTAVUS A. WEBER, THE PATENT OFFICE : ITS HISTORY , ACTIVITIES AND ORGANIZATION 6 (1924). Second, the burden of determining patent validity rested with the courts, which were soon overwhelmed. See id.; see also Craig Allen Nard, Legal Forms and the Common Law of Patents , 90 B.U. L. REV. 51, 65 (2010) (\"The 1793 Act shifted patent protection analyses from an ex ante gatekeeper role performed by the examination to an ex post proceeding in the courts.\").

Merges, The Trouble with Trolls: Innovation, Rent-Seeking, and Patent Law Reform , 24 B ERKELEY TECH. L.J. 1583, 1592 976 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 Improving patent quality is one of the major challenges of patent law. Complaints have become louder in recent years because the proliferation of questionable patents creates uncertainty in the patent system. 91 There is uncertainty about patent scope, the validity of issued patents, and enforcement.92 Uncertainty increases opportunistic behavior;93 raises the overall amount, expense, and complexity of patent litigation;94 and hinders competition, commercialization, and innovation.95 In theory, patent examination should reduce uncertainty.96 I contend that three asymmetries in patent examination make this difficult. 97 After describing the asymmetries, I propose a new patent examination paradigm, which will reduce uncertainty, and thus, improve patent quality.98 II.

The Proof Asymmetry Recall that patent examination is an ex parte proceeding between the examiner and the applicant.99 Driving it are evidentiary mechanisms which include presumptions and shifting burdens of (2009). 90 Wyman, supra note 38, at 204-09. 91 See FTC REPORT , supra note 82, at 53-55; Hall & Harhoff, supra note 81, at 992-95. 92 Wagner, supra note 77, at 2140; see Note, Estopping the Madness at the PTO: Improving Patent Administration Through Prosecution History Estoppel , 116 H ARV.

The Current Paradigm A basic tenet of patent examination is that an applicant is entitled to a patent unless the PTO can prove otherwise.102 The corollary is that a patent application presumptively complies with the statutory patentability requirements when it is filed. 103 Thus, the burden of proving unpatentability rests with the PTO.104 If it appears that the invention does not satisfy a patentability requirement, the examiner has the initial burden of building and presenting a prima facie case of unpatentability. 105 It is established when \"the information compels a conclusion that a claim is unpatentable under the preponderance of evidence, burden-of- proof standard, . . . before any consideration is given to evidence which may be submitted in an attempt to establish a contrary conclusion of patentability.\" 106 The type of proof required to make a prima facie case depends on the statutory provision at issue. But, as a general matter, the examiner satisfies the initial burden by \"adequately explain[ing] the shortcomings [he or she] perceives so that the applicant is properly notified and able to respond.\" 107 If this burden is met,108 the burden of 100 See supra note 61. 101 FTC REPORT , supra note 82, at 8 (\"A plethora of presumptions and procedures tip the scales in favor of the ultimate issuance of a patent, once an application is filed.\"); cf.

Cir. 2007). 108 If the examiner fails to establish a prima facie obvious case, the applicant need not provide any rebuttal evidence and is entitled to a patent barring other grounds for 978 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 production shifts to the applicant to rebut the examiner's contention of unpatentability with persuasive argument or proof.109 When the applicant submits rebuttal evidence, the examiner must \"start over\"110 and \"consider all of the evidence anew.\"111 The burden of production may continue to shift as each side presents new evidence; however, the examiner carries the burden of persuasion.112 And since the examiner has no way to test the applicant's assertions, \"[those] that cannot be overcome by documentary evidence promptly identifiable by the examiner often must be accepted.\" 113 The examiner must determine patentability based on the entire record,114 with a preponderance of the evidence as the standard of proof.115 Absent any other grounds of unpatentability, the PTO must issue the patent.116 To illustrate the current framework, consider the following hypothetical. Suppose the inventor develops a wood cleaner made from a solution of lemon oil, mineral oil, and white vinegar in a 1:1:4 ratio. Testing reveals that the solution cleans all wood surfaces including antiques, furniture, and kitchen cabinets without drying the wood finish. Based on these results, the inventor files a patent application. Although the application's written description 117 only discloses experimental details for the lemon oil embodiment,118 it states that the unpatentability. In re Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 710 (Fed.

This is considered a \"broad\" claim because the language does not limit the invention to any specific citrus oil. 119 An examiner reads the application to check it for compliance with the statutory patentability requirements.120 Focusing on enablement, the question is whether, as of the filing date, a person having ordinary skill in the art (\"PHOSITA\") 121 could make and use the invention as broadly as it is claimed without undue experimentation.122 Analyzing enablement is a fact-intensive inquiry which includes construing the claim to determine its scope, 123 evaluating the teaching provided in the written description, and determining the PHOSITA's knowledge and skill. 124 patent application or patent.

See Panduit Corp. v. Dennison Mfg. Co., 810 F.2d 1561, 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Factors relevant to constructing the PHOSITA in a particular technical field include the sophistication of the technology, the educational level of the inventor, the educational level of active workers in the field, the types of problems encountered in the art, prior art solutions to those problems, and the rapidity with which innovations are made. Envtl. Designs, Ltd. v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 713 F.2d 693, 696 (Fed. Cir. 1983). 122 In re Wright, 999 F.2d 1557, 1561 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Although the term \"undue experimentation\" does not appear in the statute, \"it is well established that enablement requires that the specification teach those in the art to make and use the invention without undue experimentation.\" In re Wands, 858 F.2d 731, 737 (Fed. Cir. 1988). 123 Claim construction includes defining ambiguous terms while simultaneously giving the claim language its broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the written description.

Cir. 1999) (\"[W]ith respect to enablement[,] the relevant inquiry lies in the relationship between the [written description], the claims, and the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.\"). The Federal Circuit has articulated a nonexhaustive list of factors \u2014 the so-called Wands factors \u2014 for determining undue experimentation, including (1) the amount of direction or guidance presented in the disclosure; (2) the existence of working examples; (3) the nature of the invention; (4) 980 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 The analysis leads the examiner to reject the claim as prima facie nonenabled.125 Relying on a reference126 which explains that citrus oils share many properties but often differ in others,127 the examiner concludes that a PHOSITA could not read the applicant's description about the single embodiment actually made (lemon oil) and extrapolate from it how to make other embodiments encompassed by the claim (the universe of citrus oils) with a reasonable expectation of success. 128 Relatedly, the claim could cover a lot of embodiments that cannot be made or do not work,129 and the examiner has no way of testing them.130 So the examiner contends that a PHOSITA would have to engage in undue experimentation to figure out which citrus oils work as well as the proper ratios of citrus oil, mineral oil, and white vinegar to achieve the claimed result (wood cleaning).131 the predictability or unpredictability of the art; (5) the PHOSITA's relative skill; (6) the state of the prior art; (7) the breadth of the claims; and (8) the quantity of experimentation necessary to practice the claimed invention.

Cir. 1991) (noting that the Wands factors are illustrative and not mandatory). 125 To establish a prima facie case of nonenablement, the examiner must explain why the claim scope sought is not commensurate with the scope of the teaching provided in the written description. Wright , 999 F.2d at 1561-62. 126 The examiner must support rejections with references (such as printed publications). In re Marzocchi, 439 F.2d 220, 224 (C.C.P.A. 1971); Brebner, 455 F.2d 1402, 1405 (C.C.P.A. 1972) (holding that the PTO must provide a factual basis for a nonenablement rejection rather than conclusory statements). 127 See generally GIOVANNI DUGO & LUIGI MONDELLO , CITRUS OILS: COMPOSITION , ADVANCED ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES , CONTAMINANTS , AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY (2010). 128 Cf. Wright , 999 F.2d at 1564 (affirming the PTO's nonenablement rejection for a claim covering all live, non-pathogenic vaccines for ribonucleic acid (\"RNA\") viruses because the applicant failed to produce evidence that a PHOSITA would have believed that the disclosed success with one strain of an avian RNA virus \"could be extrapolated with a reasonable expectation of success\" to other RNA viruses encompassed by the broad claims). Whether a single working example is sufficient to enable a broad claim is a quintessential enablement issue. Compare In re Vickers, 141 F.2d 522, 525 (C.C.P.A. 1944) (explaining that an inventor \"is generally allowed [broad] claims, when the art permits, which cover more than the specific embodiment shown\"), with Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 481 F.3d 1371, 1379-80 (Fed.

Solutia Inc., 289 F.3d 1367, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (explaining that a claim may be invalid for a lack of enablement if it covers a significant number of inoperative embodiments). 130 See supra note 113. 131 See supra note 122 (describing \"without undue experimentation\"). 2016] Patent Asymmetries 981 But again, the applicant enjoys a presumption that the full scope of the claim is enabled and the examiner carries the burden of proving otherwise. 132 With this in mind, the applicant responds with two related rebuttal arguments. First, to satisfy enablement, the applicant can rely on what the PHOSITA already knows to provide information not explicitly set forth in the patent document.133 Second, experimentation that is time-consuming or requires the manipulation of multiple variables is not necessarily undue \u2014 particularly if the nature of the art so demands, 134 the experimentation is \"merely routine,\"135 or the written description \"provides a reasonable amount of guidance with respect to the direction in which experimentation should proceed.\"136 Upon reconsideration, the examiner is unwilling or unable to challenge the applicant and withdraws the enablement rejection.137 Absent other grounds for unpatentability, the application proceeds to patent issuance. 138 2. Implications for Patent Quality, Innovation, and Patent Policy As noted earlier, certain practices and procedures at the PTO have contributed to the issuance of low-quality patents.139 The agency's 132 See In re Marzocchi, 439 F.2d 220, 223 (C.C.P.A. 1971). 133 AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac, 344 F.3d 1234, 1244 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (explaining that the patent document \"[need not] describe how to make and use every possible variant of the claimed invention, for the [PHOSITA's] knowledge of the prior art and routine experimentation can often fill gaps . . . and perhaps even extrapolate beyond the disclosed embodiments, depending upon the predictability of the art\"). But see ALZA Corp. v. Andrx Pharms., LLC, 603 F.3d 935, 940-41 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (explaining that an applicant cannot simply rely on the PHOSITA's knowledge as a substitute for missing information). 134 In re Wands, 858 F.2d 731, 737 (Fed. Cir. 1988); re Angstadt, 537 F.2d 498, 502-03 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (explaining that since limiting claim scope to embodiments actually made is bad patent policy, the unfortunate consequence is that a PHOSITA may have to engage in time-consuming experimentation to figure out what works). 135 Johns Hopkins Univ. v. CellPro, Inc., 152 F.3d 1342, 1360 (Fed.

Even if examiners are better equipped and motivated to do their jobs, compelling them to affirmatively prove unpatentability still gives applicants the upper hand. 143 As explained in the Federal Trade Commission's 2003 report on the patent system and how to improve it: The ex parte nature of the [examination] proceeding leaves the examiner on his or her own to evaluate and challenge applicants' assertions. Because the courts have placed the burden on the PTO to demonstrate grounds for rejecting a patent, rather than on the applicant to demonstrate that it meets the statutory criteria, difficulties in assembling responsive evidence work in favor of patent applicants. 144 This predilection toward patent issuance impedes efforts to improve patent examination quality and reduce overall application volume (and hence, the application backlog) 145 by deterring filings for frivolous inventions.146 140 See, e.g. , U.S. PATENT & TRADEMARK OFFICE , 2014-2018 STRATEGIC PLAN 8 (2014), available at http://www.uspto.gov/about/stratplan/USPTO_2014-2018_ Strategic_Plan.pdf; Michelle K.

On the other hand, a robust regime does the opposite because inventors \"would understand that [low-quality] applications are a waste of time and money.\" Id. 2016] Patent Asymmetries 983 The patent system's overarching goal is to promote technological progress.147 In theory, each of the individual statutory requirements for patentability seeks to further this objective.148 But given that the presumption of patentability presupposes that every patent application fully complies with each requirement,149 an important question is whether the presumption of patentability can interfere with the screening function of the statutory requirements and actually impede technological progress. The presumption has a greater adverse effect on some statutory requirements than on others. For instance, certain judicially-created rules and standards pertaining to the law of novelty 150 and nonobviousness151 can temper the presumption in certain situations 147 See supra note 32 and accompanying text. 148 See, e.g. , Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 148 (1989) (noting that an invention which lacks novelty not only adds nothing to the sum of human knowledge, but \"would in fact injure the public by removing existing knowledge from public use\"); Nat'l Recovery Techs., Inc. v. Magnetic Separation Sys., Inc., 166 F.3d 1190, 1195-96 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (noting that the purpose of the enablement requirement is to ensure enrichment of public knowledge). 149 See supra note 103 and accompanying text. 150 Novelty ensures that an invention is new by denying a patent if the claimed subject matter is identical to what is already known. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-102 (2012). An invention enjoys a presumption of novelty, which means that the examiner must prove that the invention already exists in the prior art to defeat the novelty requirement. In re Wilder, 429 F.2d 447, 450 (C.C.P.A. 1970). To illustrate how the novelty doctrine can temper the presumption, suppose that the invention at issue is a device, and the examiner finds a prior art reference which discloses a picture of an identical device but does not explain how to make it. The courts have held that the examiner is allowed to presume that a PHOSITA could have made the device disclosed in the prior art. See In re Antor Media Corp., 689 F.3d 1282, 1287-88 (Fed. Cir. 2012). To move forward, the burden shifts to the applicant to prove that a PHOSITA could not have made the device without undue experimentation. Id. (citing In re Sasse, 629 F.2d 675, 681 (C.C.P.A. 1980)). If the applicant cannot do this, the device is unpatentable. Wilder , 429 F.2d at 450-52; In re Jacobs, 318 F.2d 743, 745 (C.C.P.A. 1963). 151 Nonobviousness ensures that an invention is \"new enough,\" 1 C HISUM , supra note 52, \u00a7 3.01, meaning that it targets inventions which are sufficiently close to the prior art and thus, within the PHOSITA's technical grasp. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 (2012). An examiner must evaluate nonobviousness by considering the scope and content of the relevant prior art; the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention; the PHOSITA's level of skill; and secondary considerations which provide objective proof of nonobviousness, such as commercial success and a long felt but unmet need for the invention. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1966). Importantly for present purposes, the nonobviousness hurdle is now higher than before. See KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 415 (2007) (rejecting the Federal Circuit's rigid test for nonobviousness because it was inconsistent with the \"expansive and flexible\" approach set forth in Graham ). 984 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 by placing a heavier burden on the applicant.152 Denying a patent in these situations fulfills a basic policy objective of the patent system: to thwart a patent that would impinge upon unfettered access to technology already in the public domain. 153 However, the situation is quite different for enablement \u2014 the patentability requirement which \"lies at the heart of the patent bargain . . . .\" 154 By requiring an applicant to provide a disclosure sufficient to teach a PHOSITA how to make and use the invention,155 enablement ensures that the applicant's disclosure sufficiently enriches public knowledge. 156 There is hope that the knowledge gained will reduce research and development (\"R&D\") waste,157 spur creativity,158 and ultimately extend the frontiers of science and technology.159 Importantly, and in contrast to novelty and nonobviousness, the presumption of patentability is not tempered in the enablement context because the substantive law of enablement has a strong pro-patent bias. 160 This becomes clear when one looks at the burden faced by an examiner who wants to mount an enablement challenge. The key factor in the enablement inquiry is the substantive teaching 152 See, e.g. , Antor Media , 689 F.3d at 1287-88; see also supra note 150. 153 See Pfaff v.

DreamWorks, LLC, 516 F.3d 993, 1000 (Fed. Cir. 2008). 162 See In re Strahilevitz, 668 F.2d 1229, 1232 (C.C.P.A. 1982) (explaining \"that working examples are desirable in complex technologies\"); cf.

It is well settled in U.S. patent law that the concept itself \u2014 and not any physical act \u2014 is the key facet of the inventive process. Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc., 525 U.S. 55, 60 (1998). 165 Christopher A. Cotropia, The Folly of Early Filing in Patent Law , 61 H ASTINGS L.J. 65, 93 (2009) [hereinafter Early Filing ] (citing Impax Labs., Inc. v. Aventis Pharm., Inc., 545 F.3d 1312, 1314-15 (Fed.

Seymore, Patently Impossible , 64 V AND. L. REV. 1491, 1528 (2011) [hereinafter Patently Impossible ]. Thus, the lack of a detailed teaching means that a PHOSITA will probably need to engage in undue experimentation to practice the full scope of the invention. See id. at 1530. 986 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 Though it is true that the courts have started to police compliance with enablement more aggressively,171 the fact still remains that an examiner who questions enablement bears the burdens of both building a prima facie case of nonenablement and carrying the ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue. 172 These burdens tip the scales toward patent issuance not only because of the examiner's time pressures and incentives, 173 but also because \"[i]t is actually very difficult to offer rigorous proof that something cannot be done . . . .\"174 So it is easy to see how dubiously enabled patents (and thus, patents of dubious quality) can slip through the cracks. Of course, such patents add little or nothing to the public storehouse of technical knowledge, 175 supply little technical fodder for follow-on researchers to build upon,176 and can create insurmountable roadblocks (intentionally or not)177 for others with meritorious inventions.178 171 See infra notes 245-46 and accompanying text. 172 See discussion supra Part II.A.1. 173 Examiner incentives are complicated; certain application-related activities \"count\" more for production goals, promotion, and bonus decisions than others. Mark A. Lemley & Bhaven Sampat, Examiner Characteristics and Patent Office Outcomes , 94 REV. ECON. & STAT. 817, 818 (2012). For example, prior art searching and issuing a final rejection do not count, but a case disposal (through allowance or abandonment), response to an RCE, or first action on a continuation application count.

It does little to advance technological progress, which the Constitution requires. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 6 (1966). 177 For instance, so-called \"nuisance\" prior art describing an unworkable invention \"can . . . be generated as a result of a bona fide attempt at a constructive reduction to practice that for some unexpected reason fails to work as disclosed.\" David S. Wainwright, Patenting Around Nuisance Prior Art , 81 J. PAT. & TRADEMARK OFF. SOC'Y 221, 223-24 (1999). Innocuously disclosed information has the same effect. See id. at 222, 223 n.3. 178 A good example is when an early filer strategically drafts claims which cover undeveloped technology. See BESSEN & MEURER , supra note 1, at 67 (arguing that the practice \"penalizes real innovators who operate in the shadow of early, broad claims\"). 2016] Patent Asymmetries 987 3. Is There a Statutory Basis for the Pro-Patent Bias? The presumption of patentability and burden-shifting framework emerged from centuries-old agency practices,179 later buttressed by decisional law from the U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (\"C.C.P.A.\")180 and its successor court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.181 Those who defend this paradigm now point to the introductory clause of \u00a7 102 of Title 35 of the Patent Act for support, which states that \"[a] person shall be entitled to a patent unless . . . .\" 182 Since \u00a7 102 deals with novelty, on its face the language seems to create a presumption of novelty. The C.C.P.A. recognized as much.183 Yet the Federal Circuit has construed this language much more broadly to compel the PTO to demonstrate unpatentability for any of the patentability criteria.184 One possible justification for this one-size- fits-all interpretation is that it would be unworkable for applicants, the PTO, and the courts to handle different and unique presumptions and proof burdens for each patentability requirement. 185 179 See, e.g. , E.J. STODDARD , ANNOTATED RULES OF PRACTICE IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE 226 (1920) (Rule 65, which explained that \"[t]he reasons for the rejection will be fully and precisely stated\" so as to aid the applicant in deciding whether to prosecute his application or alter the specification); id. at 231 (Rule 66, which required the examiner to explain the pertinence of an asserted reference); see also Leon Zitver, The Resolution of Doubt , 28 J. PAT. OFF. SOC'Y 389, 397-98 (1946) (exploring the history of placing the burden of proving unpatentability on the examiner). 180 The C.C.P.A. was a five-judge Article III appellate court on the same level as the U.S. Courts of Appeals. See GILES S. RICH, A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF CUSTOMS AND PATENT APPEALS 1-2 (1980). 181 The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 abolished the C.C.P.A. See Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-164, 96 Stat. 36 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C.). Soon after its creation, the Federal Circuit adopted C.C.P.A. decisional law as binding precedent. See South Corp. v. United States, 690 F.2d 1368, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (en banc). 182 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 (2012). 183 In re Wilder, 429 F.2d 447, 450 (C.C.P.A. 1970) (\"[T]he statute provides for what may be said to be a presumption of novelty in the language of section 102 'a person shall be entitled to a patent unless . . . .'\" (emphasis added)). 184 See FTC REPORT , supra note 82, at 8 n.56. So as far as the presumption is concerned, the courts make no distinction between novelty and the other substantive requirements for patentability. 185 But see Aristocrat Techs. Austl. PTY Ltd. v. Int'l Game Tech., 543 F.3d 657, 662 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (noting that while utility, patent-eligible subject matter, novelty, and nonobviousness are \"conditions for patentability,\" the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 112 are \"merely requirements for obtaining a valid patent\"). 988 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 The Federal Circuit also points to the introductory clause of \u00a7 102 as support for the locution of the initial burden of producing evidence and the burden of persuasion. 186 As former Chief Judge Paul Michel once explained: If the claimed invention is patentable, the applicant is entitled to a patent (because the statute says so) \u2014 not eventually, but as soon as patentability can be determined. Moreover, the burden of proof is on the PTO to show unpatentability, not on the applicant to establish patentability, and it remains on the PTO even if [it] has made a prima facie case. 187 This expansive interpretation of the clause not only places an applicant in a very good position but also impedes attempts \"to weed out unwarranted patents.\"188 The details of the clause's drafting history also suggest that the Federal Circuit is reading too much into it. The 1952 Patent Act was co-drafted by then-Examiner-in-Chief Pasquale J. (Pat) Federico 189 and then-patent attorney and future C.C.P.A. and Federal Circuit Judge Giles Sutherland Rich. 190 In a first-person account of the drafting of the clause, Judge Rich explained the choice of positive language: There is an interesting thing about the introductory clause of . . . [\u00a7] 102. Pat [Federico] originally wrote \"An invention shall not be considered new or capable of being patented if . . . .\" As the drafting progressed, taking a tip from the Lanham Act, section 2, we turned it into the positive statement \"A person shall be entitled to a patent unless . . . .\" as it reads 186 Cf. FTC REPORT , supra note 82, at 9 (\"[T]he courts have interpreted the patent statute to require the PTO to grant a patent application unless the PTO can establish that the claimed invention does not meet one or more of the patentability criteria. Once an application is filed, the claimed invention is effectively presumed to warrant a patent unless the PTO can prove otherwise.\"). 187 Paul R. Michel, The Challenge Ahead: Increasing Predictability in Federal Circuit Jurisprudence for the New Century , 43 A M. U. L. REV. 1231, 1249 (1994). 188 FTC REPORT , supra note 82, at 31-32. 189 For a short biographical sketch, see Giles S. Rich, P.J. (Pat) Federico and His Works , 64 J. PAT. OFF. SOC'Y 3, 3-11 (1982). 190 See Giles S. Rich, Congressional Intent \u2014 Or, Who Wrote the Patent Act of 1952?, Lecture Presented at the First Annual Institute on Patent Law (Mar. 21-22, 1963) , in PATENT PROCUREMENT AND EXPLOITATION 61, 67-69 (1963) (discussing the composition of the Drafting Committee for the bill that became the 1952 Patent Act). 2016] Patent Asymmetries 989 today. We just felt like slapping down the detractors of the patent system, many of whom were in the judiciary.191 The judicial hostility existed at the Supreme Court, which Justice Jackson admitted in a 1949 opinion had a \"strong passion . . . for striking [patents] down\"192 and believed that \"the only patent that is valid is one which this Court has not been able to get its hands on.\"193 But the Federal Circuit's motivation for an expansive interpretation of the clause might have less to do with changing attitudes about the patent system and more to do with the court's interest in exerting its influence over the PTO. To the extent that the Federal Circuit views itself as the overseer of the agency, 194 the court has an interest in ensuring that the PTO refrains from making arbitrary patentability determinations. This explains, at least in part, why the court insists that the PTO supports determinations of unpatentability with factual evidence or sound technical reasoning 195 rather than with conclusory statements196 or subjective judgments.197 Thus, it could be argued that 191 Janice M. Mueller, A Rich Legacy , 14 B ERKELEY TECH. L.J. 895, 902 (1999) (quoting an e-mail from Judge Giles S. Rich to Janice Mueller, Assoc. Professor, The John Marshall Law School (Aug. 8, 1997)).

Hear-Wear 990 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 the current proof paradigm exists simply to ensure fairness in patent examination. A different view is that it reflects skepticism about the PTO's technical competence. 198 In fact, the introductory clause of \u00a7 102 raises an interesting interpretive question. I contend that the language \"[a] person shall be entitled to a patent unless . . . .\" simply states that unless the applicant satisfies the statutory patentability criteria, the applicant is not entitled to a patent. Or, stated differently, if the applicant satisfies the statutory patentability criteria, then the applicant is entitled to a patent. The clause says nothing about a presumption or burden of proof \u2014 all it does is merely state what must be done to receive a patent. This interpretation makes sense as a normative matter. The current proof paradigm is anomalous and outside of the mainstream of agency action. Even for mundane things like driver's licenses, permits, and passports, the applicant does not presumptively get it unless the agency can prove nonentitlement. There is no presumption at all; rather, the applicant has the burden of proving an entitlement (by for example, providing documentary evidence and satisfying prescribed criteria). 199 And those rights pale in comparison to the twenty-year exclusory right conferred by a patent. It is nonsensical that anyone who shows up at the PTO is presumptively entitled to a patent and will get one unless the examiner can prove nonentitlement by a preponderance of the evidence. 200 Techs., LLC, 751 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2014). 197 For an example of the courts chastising the PTO for subjective judgments, see In re Ratti, 270 F.2d 810, 814 (C.C.P.A. 1959) (rejecting the agency's contention that an invention must possess \"some definite advantage over the prior art\" in order to be patentable). 198 See Craig Allen Nard, Deference, Defiance, and the Useful Arts , 56 O HIO ST.

As discussed below in Part III, I propose a regime which does away with the presumption of patentability and places the burden of persuasion on the applicant. 201 This would eliminate the proof asymmetry and rebalance the scales of patentability. B. The Information Asymmetry To a large extent, the assurance of a good PTO examination is all about information.202 Clearly an examiner must have all of the relevant technical information in hand in order to accurately gauge patentability. A fair amount of information comes from the searchable body of patent and non-patent literature 203 (although examiners show a bias toward the former).204 But given that the inventor is generally a person of extraordinary skill205 who knows more about the invention and the technical field than the examiner,206 no one actually believes that all of the relevant information that the inventor has ends up before the examiner. 207 This information asymmetry inevitably allows 201 See infra Part III. 202 See Christopher A. Cotropia, Modernizing Patent Law's Inequitable Conduct Doctrine , 24 B ERKELEY TECH. L.J. 723, 748 (2009) (\"The assurance of a good patent quality is all about information . . . .\"). 203 The patent literature consists of issued patents and published patent applications. Principal sources of nonpatent literature include books, treatises, and technical journals. 204 See John R. Allison & Mark A. Lemley, The Growing Complexity of the United States Patent System , 82 B.U. L. REV. 77, 102 (2002) (\"[T]he PTO is much more likely to find documents that it itself has generated.\"); Bhaven N.

Understanding the Information Deficit Patent procurement imposes a substantial information burden on the PTO. As Professor Lee Petherbridge has explained: The Patent Office has three primary information functions . . . collection, use, and recordation. The Patent Office performs its \"collection\" function by (1) collecting information concerning the boundaries of the property for which an applicant seeks the right to exclude and (2) collecting information concerning the prior art [or other patently relevant factors]. The Patent Office performs its \"use\" function by engaging in the substantive decision making that attends the statutory requirements for patentability. The Patent Office performs its \"recordation\" function by (1) recording information useful for defining the boundaries of the property and (2) recording information that shows how the boundaries of the patented property make that property . . . distinct from property already in the public domain. 208 The collection and use functions in particular can be very information- demanding inquiries.209 For example, the Federal Circuit has articulated eight factors which can be relevant in determining whether an applicant's disclosure satisfies the enablement requirement; including the state of the prior art and the PHOSITA's knowledge and level of skill. 210 Similarly, nonobviousness is a highly fact-intensive inquiry that also depends on the nature of the technology and the PHOSITA's knowledge and skill.211 The information demands of these adversarial check); infra notes 218-19 and accompanying text. 208 Lee Petherbridge, Positive Examination , 46 IDEA 173, 189 (2006). 209 See Peter Lee, Patent Law and the Two Cultures , 120 Y ALE L.J. 2, 62-74 (2010) (exploring the information-demanding nature of the patentability requirements and the associated costs and externalities). 210 See discussion supra note 124 (discussing the test for enablement set forth in In re Wands, 858 F.2d 731, 737 (Fed. Cir. 1988)). 211 Christopher A. Cotropia, Nonobviousness and the Federal Circuit: An Empirical Analysis of Recent Case Law , 82 N OTRE DAME L. REV. 911, 929 (2007). The nonobviousness requirement, embodied in \u00a7 103(a) of the Patent Act, denies patents for trivial extensions of what is already in the public domain. See John F. Duffy, Inventing Invention: A Case Study of Legal Innovation , 86 T EX. L. REV. 1, 6-17 (2007) 2016] Patent Asymmetries 993 multifactor inquiries intensify as the subject matter becomes more complex.212 The information deficit is exacerbated by a disconnect between the patent examiner and mainstream science and technology. Structural and substantive aspects of patent examination cause this technological lag.213 Given the technical nature of the examiner's job, one might expect this individual to know exactly what is happening at the forefront of theory and experiment in a particular discipline. This is not the case, however, because the examiner is not an active researcher. And the examiner's time pressures, incentives, and production goals afford little opportunity for professional development. 214 Together, these realities essentially divorce examiners from the frontlines of science \u2014 a place where patent protection is often crucial. 215 An unfamiliarity with new technologies and lack of information about them may ultimately hurt patent (examination) quality. 216 Solving the information-gathering problem is not easy. For instance, providing examiners with more time to work on complex cases would not solve the problem. As Joseph Scott Miller has argued: (exploring the wisdom of denying patents for trivial inventions). For the basic framework for determining nonobviousness set forth by the Supreme Court in Graham v. John Deere Co ., 383 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1966), see discussion supra note 151. 212 See Lee, supra note 209, at 67. 213 Seymore, Patently Impossible , supra note 170, at 1512-14. 214 For a discussion of the examiner's incentives, see supra notes 12 and 173. The amount of time the PTO allots for an examiner to dispose of a case depends on factors like patent seniority and the technology involved. See Michael D. Frakes & Melissa F. Wasserman, Does Agency Funding Affect Decisionmaking?: An Empirical Assessment of the PTO's Granting Patterns , 66 V AND. L. REV. 65 app. A, at 135-36 tbl.1 (tabulating examiner hours allotted for various technology classes). 215 See, e.g. , Lemley, Rational Ignorance , supra note 11, at 1504 (suggesting that a firm may obtain a patent to \"stake their claim\" in an area of technology to signal to investors and competitors that it operates at the cutting edge); Clarisa Long, Patent Signals , 69 U. CHI. L. REV. 625, 647-49 (2002) (arguing that firms obtain patents to show their R&D acumen or technological capacity). 216 BESSEN & MEURER , supra note 1, at 161; see also John R. Allison & Ronald J. Mann, The Disputed Quality of Software Patents , 85 W ASH. U. L. REV. 297, 314 (2007) (\"[P]atent examiners unfamiliar with a cutting-edge technology like software may be less capable of assessing the quality of the disclosure or of the innovation than they are in technological areas with which they are more familiar.\"). To improve technical training in the examining corps, the PTO has created a program which invites technical experts to volunteer as guest lecturers \"to update [examiners] on technical developments, the state of the art, emerging trends, maturing technologies, and recent innovations in their fields.\" Patent Examiner Technical Training Program, 75 Fed. Reg. 56059 (Sept. 15, 2010). 994 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 [E]ven if the Patent Office were to invest far more in reviewing applications, its review would still suffer from a basic knowledge deficit compared to that which well-informed inventors and their competitors possess. Unlike these parties, the Patent Office is not actually innovating on the leading edge of technological change in a given field. 217 Applicants can do much to improve the information deficit because they \"know better than [the PTO or] anyone else precisely what it is they have developed or invented.\" 218 The challenge is to get this knowledge into the examiner's hands.219 2. Proof Problems There is a link between the information asymmetry and proof asymmetry discussed in the previous section.220 To understand this linkage, it is first necessary to ask why the Federal Circuit embraces the current proof paradigm. One reason might be that the court wants to maximize the quantity of information generated during 217 Joseph Scott Miller, Building a Better Bounty: Litigation-Stage Rewards for Defeating Patents , 19 B ERKELEY TECH. L.J. 667, 733 (2004). 218 See id. at 734. 219 The PTO seeks to combat its information deficit by imposing upon applicants \"a duty of candor and good faith in dealing with the Office, which includes a duty to disclose to the Office all information known to that individual to be material to patentability.\" 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.56(a) (2015). I should note that recent amendments to the patent statute under the America Invents Act permit third parties to submit patents, published patent applications, or other printed publications to the PTO for consideration and inclusion in the record of a pending patent application if accompanied by a concise statement of relevance. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 122(e) (2012); 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.290 (2015). But third-party submission will likely only have a negligible impact on patent quality. See Christopher A. Cotropia et al., Do Applicant Patent Citations Matter? , 42 R ES. POL'Y 844, 845-48 (2013) (finding that examiners overwhelmingly evaluate prior art that they uncover through their own search); Wagner, supra note 77, at 2163-64 (\"I am skeptical that broadening public access (e.g., allowing additional third party submissions) will be scaled to anything near the size required to make a substantial contribution to patent quality . . . .\"); Paul Morgan, Guest Third-Party Prior Art? , P ATENTLY -O (Jan. 16, 2012), http://patentlyo.com/patent/2012/01/guest-post-should-you-submit-third-party-prior-art.html (questioning overall effectiveness of third-party submissions, examiner reliance on such submissions, and challenging the \"strange inherent assumption that large numbers of the public have nothing better to do with their time and money than to undertake the tens of thousands of prior art searches and claim-relevant submissions that would be needed to have any significant effect on patent examination quality for the more than 500,000 patent applications a year\"). 220 See supra Part II.A. 2016] Patent Asymmetries 995 examination to ensure the production of a robust record for appeal.221 When the court adjudicates an ex parte appeal from the PTO,222 it receives a record, which is expressly limited to the prosecution history 223 and proceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.224 So one could argue that the court has constructed the current proof paradigm \u2014 at least in part \u2014 to address its own information deficit. 225 In deciding whether the applicant or the PTO is in the best position to provide this information, the court seems to believe \u2014 and perhaps not unreasonably so (even if not rightly) \u2014 that requiring the PTO to both go first by building a prima facie case of unpatentability and to carry the burden of persuasion is the best way to achieve this goal. 226 Yet, if anything, this proof paradigm exacerbates the information asymmetry. While requiring the examiner to present a prima facie case of unpatentability might be a sensible way to begin prosecution, assigning the PTO the burden of persuasion \u2014 particularly when coupled with the presumption of patentability \u2014 is a bad way to force information from the applicant. What it does is force information from the examiner , who must articulate why the invention fails to meet one or more of the statutory patentability criteria. 227 Then and only then 221 See Holbrook, Presumptions , supra note 207, at 817-18 (noting that the court's use of presumptions in the infringement context serves an \"information-forcing\" function). 222 For a general discussion of ex parte appeals, see supra note 59. 223 The prosecution history \"is the written record of an applicant's dealings with the [PTO], including any actions taken by the examiner, and any statements, arguments, or modifications of the claims made by the applicant.\" D URHAM , supra note 15, at 196. 224 U.S.C. see also In Gartside, 203 F.3d 1305, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (\"In appeals from the Board, we have before us a comprehensive record that contains the arguments and evidence presented by the parties . . . . That record, . . . . [and] thus dictates the parameters of our review.\"). By contrast, when a disgruntled applicant files a civil action, \"there are no limitations on a patent applicant's ability to introduce new evidence in a \u00a7 145 proceeding beyond those already present in the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" Kappos v. Hyatt, 132 S. Ct. 1690, 1700-01 (2012); see also discussion supra note 59. So in contrast to direct appeal from PTAB, the \u00a7 145 path can provide the Federal Circuit with more information. 225 See supra note 221. 226 Put simply, the court views the status quo as the most pragmatic way to get information in the ex parte appeal context. See Lee, supra note 209, at 77-79 (arguing that in contrast to district court judges who can conduct complicated factfinding and the Supreme Court which can take a \"big picture\" approach to patent cases, the Federal Circuit is primarily concerned with \"everyday practicality\"). 227 See discussion supra Part II.A.1. 996 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 must the applicant provide any information \u2014 but only enough to adequately attack or rebut the examiner's contentions.228 In other words, applicants have an incentive to behave strategically by providing information that is only absolutely necessary to move prosecution forward and get the claims allowed. 229 Much of what the applicant knows about the invention or technology fails to reach the examiner which, in turn, exacerbates the information deficit in the PTO and ultimately at the Federal Circuit. 230 The resulting information asymmetry tips the scales of patentability toward the applicant and compromises patent quality. C. The Legal Asymmetry There is an additional asymmetry in patent examination that has escaped the attention of legal scholars. It is the difference in legal acumen between the examiner and applicant \u2014 what I call the legal asymmetry. Below I explain how it also tips the scales toward patent issuance. 1. A Mismatch in Legal Acumen Examiners are hired primarily for their technical experience and ability to apply it to patent examination. 231 Most examiners have a bachelor's or master's degree in the sciences or engineering.232 Despite criticisms about their level of expertise,233 examiners are presumed to 228 See James B. Thayer, The Burden of Proof , 4 H ARV. L. REV. 45, 58 (1890) (\"He awaits the action of his adversary; and it is enough if he simply repel him.\"). Of course, the applicant must comply with the duty of candor. 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.56(a) (2015). 229 See Bruce L. Hay & Kathryn E. Spier, Burdens of Proof in Civil Litigation: An Economic Perspective , 26 J. LEGAL STUD. 413, 417 (1997) (discussing how the burden of proof assignment can alter a party's strategy in presenting information); supra note 207. 230 See supra text accompanying notes 221-26. 231 See Tamara Dillon, Patent Work: The Other Side of Invention , OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK Q. 18, 21 (2009); Patent Examiner Positions , USPTO, http://careers.uspto. gov/Pages/PEPositions (last visited July 20, 2015). 232 See sources cited supra note 231. 233 See, e.g. , THOMAS H. STANTON ET AL ., NAT'L ACAD. OF PUB. ADMIN ., U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE : TRANSFORMING TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURY , at xviii (2005), available at http://www.napawash.org/images/reports/2005/ 05USPatentandTrademarkOffice.pdf (\"With only 45 percent of the workforce having five years or more of service, USPTO lacks adequate numbers of seasoned examiners to meet its mission challenges.\"). Many examiners leave the PTO after a few years for other careers. Mark A. Lemley, Can the Patent Office Be Fixed? , 15 M ARQ. INTELL . PROP. L. REV. 295, 300 (2011). But examiner tenure varies by technical field. See Lemley & 2016] Patent Asymmetries 997 be competent in their field of examination.234 Indeed, this (presumed) technical expertise undergirds the statutory presumption of patent validity. 235 But there is also a legal component to patent examination. Three patentability requirements \u2014 nonobviousness, enablement, and definiteness \u2014 are legal conclusions.236 So patent prosecution involves the exchange of technical and legal arguments between the examiner and applicant.237 Yet, most examiners are not lawyers. And while the PTO offers training on procedural and legal topics related to patent examination, 238 it cannot compare to formal legal training \u2014 reading cases and statutes, deductive reasoning, and learning to think like a lawyer \u2014 or the expertise acquired in patent practice.239 This gives rise to a mismatch in legal acumen in patent examination \u2014 a nonlawyer examiner (likely a novice) 240 on one side and a patent prosecutor on the other.241 Sampat, supra note 173, at 820 n.11 (noting that turnover is higher in computer arts and communications positions than in the chemical and mechanical arts). 234 In re Lemin, 364 F.2d 864, 867 (C.C.P.A. 1966); see Co. v. Piezo Tech., Inc., 860 F.2d 428, 433 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (\"It is no more appropriate to question a patent examiner's technical expertise than it is to question the quality of a judge's law school education or judicial experience.\"). 235 Interconnect Planning Corp. v.

Int'l 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (\"[A] determination of whether a claim recites the subject matter which that applicant regards as his invention and is sufficiently definite, so as to satisfy the requirements of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u00b6 2, is a legal conclusion that is reviewed de novo.\"); In re Kotzab, 217 F.3d 1365, 1369 (Fed.

The PTO's Office of Patent Training offers courses and programs for new and experienced examiners on legal and technical topics. See id. 239 The last point is particularly true for the vast majority of examiners who have a short tenure in the PTO and hence, limited experience. See supra note 233 and accompanying text. 240 See supra note 233 and accompanying text. 241 In describing patent prosecutors, the Federal Circuit has noted that the patenting process \"is a complicated one, one that requires both technical and legal credentials in order to effectively prosecute patents for inventors.\" Nilssen v. Osram Sylvania, Inc., 504 F.3d 1223, 1235 (Fed. Cir. 2007). It is true that nonlawyer patent 998 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 2. Consequences This legal asymmetry exacerbates the patent quality problem. Since the statutory patentability criteria are legal doctrines,242 a nonlawyer examiner can be hard pressed to craft robust legal arguments for denying a patent. Conversely, a nonlawyer may struggle to respond to sophisticated (or even rudimentary) legal arguments made by the applicant to rebut a prima facie case of unpatentability. The point here is that the examiner's lack of legal acumen can tip the scales of patentability toward the applicant. To illustrate, suppose the examiner has rejected a claim to a new class of chemical compounds for failure to satisfy the enablement requirement of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(a) because the applicant's written description cannot teach a PHOSITA how to make and use the full scope of what is claimed without undue experimentation. 243 The applicant responds to the rejection with the following: In [1950 case], the C.C.P.A.244 held that . . And in [1990 case], the Federal Circuit similarly held that enablement can be shown by . . . . Accordingly, the applicant respectfully asserts that the rejected claim complies with the enablement requirement of \u00a7 112(a). Although this illustration may seem trite, a nonlawyer examiner might be hard pressed to figure out: (1) what the cited cases actually say ; (2) even assuming that the applicant is making the argument in good faith, if the cited cases are relevant; and (3) how the legal standard for enablement has evolved over the past 65 years and, thus, if the cited cases are still good law. There is a good chance that a lawyer-examiner could successfully challenge the applicant's rebuttal arguments because the examiner knows about (or has the legal aptitude to understand) the Federal Circuit's move toward \"full scope\" enablement 245 and recent cases applying the more rigorous agents can prosecute applications upon exhibiting a comprehensive knowledge of patent law through passage of a registration examination (that is, the patent bar exam). See 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.7 (2015). Of course, patent agents employed by law firms are supervised by an attorney. 242 See supra note 236 and accompanying text. 243 See supra notes 121-24 and accompanying text. 244 For a discussion of the C.C.P.A. (a predecessor to the Federal Circuit), see supra notes 180-81. 245 See ALZA Corp. v. v. Dreamworks, LLC, 516 F.3d 993, 999 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (\"Enabling the full scope of each claim is 'part of the quid pro quo of the patent bargain.'\"); Sean B. 2016] Patent Asymmetries 999 standard.246 By contrast, a nonlawyer examiner might be inclined to acquiesce rather than spend time on a hard case.247 The point is that the examiner's technical training is certainly helpful but inadequate to thoroughly resolve this patentability issue. The proof paradigm discussed above makes the situation even worse. 248 Recall that the applicant enjoys a presumption of patentability and the examiner carries the burden of persuasion on unpatentability. 249 Given this proof asymmetry and the examiner's heavy caseload, incentives, and time pressures,250 a savvy applicant who responds to the examiner with legal arguments \u2014 perhaps dubious or fallacious but nevertheless hard for a nonlawyer to challenge \u2014 can lead the examiner to grant the patent just to be done with the matter. 251 Of course, examiner acquiescence frustrates the Seymore, The Enablement Pendulum Swings Back , 6 N W.

But this strategy can ultimately backfire because statements made to an examiner become a part of the prosecution history and may \"illuminate\" the scope of the claims. Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Mfg., L.P. 327 F.3d 1364, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

Am. Cyanamid Co., 774 F.2d 448, 452 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Arguments made to support patentability may also preclude a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents. Tex. Instruments Inc. v.

R EBALANCING THE SCALES OF PATENTABILITY This Article has shown that anyone who seeks a patent on anything is in a very favorable position from the outset. While the three asymmetries described herein work individually and collectively to tip the scales in favor of issuance, it is the proof asymmetry that causes the most mischief because it exacerbates the other asymmetries. 253 To address this problem, I offer a new evidentiary framework for patent examination which eliminates the proof asymmetry and, in doing so, mitigates the information and legal asymmetries. Implementing this proposal would rebalance the scales of patentability and improve patent quality. A. A New Proof Paradigm 1. Overview The starting point for the proposal is that rebalancing the scales of patentability \u2014 that is, making the issuance of a patent far from a sure thing \u2014 will require three key changes in the rules of patent examination. First, the presumption of patentability would be eliminated. 254 Second, while the burden of building a prima facie case would remain with the examiner, the burden of persuasion would now rest with the applicant. This means that an applicant's failure to establish patentability by a preponderance of the evidence will result in a patent denial. Both changes could be accomplished by judicial decision. 255 Third, I propose a supplementation rule. In limited circumstances, the applicant would be allowed to amend the patent document to include additional technical information to support patentability. This would require the Federal Circuit and the PTO to liberalize the \"new matter\" doctrine which severely restricts post-filing amendments to the disclosure. 256 To be clear, this would not give the applicant a 252 See discussion supra Part I.B. 253 See discussion supra Parts II.B-C. 254 See supra Part II.A.3. 255 See discussion supra Part II.A.3 (arguing that both the presumption of patentability and current burden-shifting framework lack a sound statutory basis). 256 When an applicant amends the written description, the PTO instructs 2016] Patent Asymmetries 1001 \"second bite at the apple\" with respect to compliance with the statutory patentability requirements; rather, the supplementation rule merely allows the applicant to adduce additional proof of patentability and include it in the patent document. The key question is whether the additional technical information \"was inherently contained in the original application\" 257as of the filing date sought \u2014 a fact-based inquiry, which depends on \"the nature of the disclosure, the state of the art, and the nature of the added matter.\" 258 If the examiner makes a positive finding, the additional technical information would be incorporated; thereby yielding a more technically robust patent document than the one originally filed. 2. Mechanics Adopting this framework would recalibrate the entire patent procurement process by making it less pro-applicant. The nature and amount of proof required from the applicant would depend on the nature of the examiner's rejection and the facts. Below I present illustrations for nonobviousness and enablement \u2014 patentability requirements involving highly fact-intensive inquiries. 259 a. Nonobviousness Suppose that an inventor develops a stainless steel dinner fork with five tines. Believing that the invention does a better job of spearing food and holding it in place than the traditional forks (with fewer tines), the inventor files a patent application later that year claiming the fork. Though multi-tined forks exist in the prior art, the claimed device is novel because it is not identically disclosed therein. 260 examiners to be on the alert for \"new matter.\" See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 132(a) (2012) (\"No amendment shall introduce new matter into the disclosure of the invention.\"); 37 The new matter prohibition \"serve[s] to ensure that the patent applicant was in full possession of the claimed subject matter on the application filing date.\" TurboCare Div. of Demag Delaval Cir. 2001). 257 TurboCare , 264 F.3d at 1118 (quoting Schering Corp. v. Amgen Inc., 222 F.3d 1347, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2000)). 258 Brooktree Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 977 F.2d 1555, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1992). 259 Enablement and nonobviousness are legal questions reviewed de novo by the court. See In re '318 Patent Infringement Litig., 583 F.3d 1317, 1323 F.3d 1351, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (discussing nonobviousness). 260 For a discussion of the novelty requirement, see supra note 150. 1002 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 The examiner then evaluates nonobviousness \u2014 the major obstacle to patentability261 and the \"bread and butter\" of patent examination.262 The examiner finds two prior art references from the same field of endeavor 263 which teach all of the limitations264 of the claimed device: a cutlery book published in 1985 disclosing a four-tined stainless steel dinner fork and a merchandise catalog from 1939 disclosing a silver five-tined serving fork. After making the factual findings set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co. 265 as to the scope and content of the prior art, the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention, and the PHOSITA's level of skill, 266 the examiner concludes that it would have been obvious for a PHOSITA at the time of filing to produce the claimed device. The examiner supports this conclusion with two rationales. First, a PHOSITA could have combined the teachings of the two references in a predictable manner 267 to produce the claimed device with a reasonable expectation of success.268 Second, the claimed invention was obvious to try because a PHOSITA seeking to solve the problem would have been aware of a finite number of predictable solutions 261 See In re Fisher, 421 F.3d 1365, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (Rader, J., dissenting) (\"The proper tool for assessing sufficient contribution to the useful arts is the [non]obviousness requirement of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.\"); Robert P.

REV. 803, 812 (1988) (describing nonobviousness as the \"final gatekeeper of the patent system\"); John R. Thomas, Formalism at the Federal Circuit , 52 A M. U. L. REV. 771, 789 (2003) (describing nonobviousness as \"[t]he fundamental gatekeeper to patenting\"). 262 Dennis D. Crouch, Understanding the Role of the Board of Patent Appeals: Ex Parte Rejection Rates on Appeal 8 (Univ. of Mo. Sch. of Law Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2009-16, 2009), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1423922 (finding that ninety percent of randomly-selected cases on appeal decided a nonobviousness issue). 263 Nonobviousness is discussed supra note 151. Briefly, a prior art reference qualifies as \u00a7 103(a) prior art if it is analogous to the field of invention. See In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 986-87 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Prior art references drawn from the same field of endeavor are considered analogous. See id. at 987. 264 Recall that a patent claim defines the (scope of the) invention. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(b) (2012). Claim \"limitations\" further limit the breadth of the claim. 1 C HISUM , supra note 52, at Gl-3. In the illustration in the above text, \"stainless steel,\" \"dinner,\" and \"five-tine[d]\" are claim limitations. 265 383 U.S. 1, 17 (1966). 266 Id.; see also discussion supra note 211. 267 See MPEP, supra note 114, \u00a7 2143(I)(A) (noting that combining references according to known methods to produce a predictable result is an appropriate rationale to support a conclusion of obviousness); cf. KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 416 (2007) (explaining that a combination of elements \"must do more than yield a predictable result\"). 268 See In re O'Farrell, 853 F.2d 894, 903-04 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (\"Obviousness require absolute predictability . . . Asymmetries 1003 (adding tines) and thus would have had good reason to pursue the claimed invention.269 Having made a prima facie case, the burden of going forward shifts to the applicant.270 The applicant argues that the claimed device satisfies a long-felt but unresolved need in the art.271 The examiner responds with a request for actual proof;272 specifically, \"objective evidence that an art recognized problem existed in the art for a long period of time without solution.\" 273 Reminded that \"the mere passage of time without the claimed invention is not evidence of nonobviousness,\" 274 the applicant abandons this strategy and attempts to prove nonobviousness by showing praise for the invention by others in the art.275 The proffered evidence includes a copy of a short write-up about the fork in Food & Wine magazine. Upon consideration of the entire record,276 the examiner concludes that the applicant has not rebutted the prima facie case of nonobviousness. If the applicant is unwilling or unable to adduce new arguments or evidence, the new fork is rendered unpatentable. Of course, denying patentability makes sense. From a theoretical standpoint, the nonobviousness requirement worked as intended \u2014 to prevent the issuance of a patent for a trivial extension of what is already in the public domain. 277 Modifying known devices (a four- tined stainless steel dinner fork and a five-tined serving fork) to 269 See KSR , 550 MPEP, Piasecki, 745 F.2d 1468, 1472 (Fed. Cir. 1984). 271 Evidence that the invention satisfied a long-felt and unmet need that existed as of the filing date can serve as an indicator of nonobviousness. See supra note 151. 272 During the course of patent examination, the examiner may request \"[t]echnical information known to [the] applicant concerning . . . the disclosure, the claimed subject matter, other factual information pertinent to patentability, or concerning the accuracy of the examiner's stated interpretation of such items.\" 37 C.F.R. 273 MPEP, supra 274 In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 990-91 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quoting Iron Grip Barbell Co. v. USA Sports, Inc., 392 F.3d 1317, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). 275 The Federal Circuit has recognized praise as a secondary (objective) indicator of nonobviousness. See Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 229 F.3d 1120, 1129 (Fed. Cir. note 52, \u00a7 5.05[4] (describing cases where praise was used as a tool to overcome nonobviousness). 276 See supra note 114 and accompanying text. 277 See Edmund W. Kitch, Graham v. John Deere Co. : New Standards for Patents , 1966 S UP. CT. REV. 293, 301 (explaining that nonobviousness is based on the principle that \"a patent should not be granted for an innovation unless [it] would have been unlikely to have been developed absent the prospect of a patent\"); discussion supra note 211. 1004 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 produce a predictable, trivial modification (a stainless-steel five-tined dinner fork) draws on knowledge already in the public domain and well within the PHOSITA's skill and ordinary creativity. 278 Thus, (the inducement of) a patent is unnecessary since the fork came about through ordinary technological progress.279 b. Enablement The second scenario is when the sufficiency of the applicant's disclosure \u2014 and enablement in particular \u2014 is at issue. To illustrate how enablement would screen inventions in the new paradigm, consider again the hypothetical discussed earlier involving a claim to a new wood cleaner made from citrus oil, mineral oil, and white vinegar. 280 Although the applicant only provided exemplification for a lemon oil embodiment, the patent application states that the invention \"is not limited to the example chosen . . . [but] other citrus oils, including, but not limited to, orange, lime, citron, and tangerine may be used.\" 281 Recall that the examiner rejected the claim as prima facie nonenabled.282 The rejection states that a PHOSITA could not read the applicant's description about the single embodiment actually made (lemon oil) and extrapolate how to make other embodiments encompassed by the claim (the universe of citrus oils) with a reasonable expectation of success. 283 Specifically, the examiner 278 See Anderson's-Black Rock, Inc. v. Pavement Salvage Co., 396 U.S. 57, 60-62 (1969) (explaining that an invention derived from old elements which does no more than expected is obvious, despite being new and useful). 279 See Michael J. Meurer & Katherine J. Strandburg, Patent Carrots and Sticks: A Model of Nonobviousness , 12 L EWIS & CLARK L. REV. 547, 549 (2008) (\"The nonobviousness threshold may be used as a 'stick' to induce researchers to pursue more difficult, socially preferred research projects.\"); cf. Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1, 11 (1966) (explaining that the nonobviousness requirement arose to \"weed[] out those inventions which would not be disclosed or devised but for the inducement of a patent\"). 280 See supra text accompanying notes 117-38. 281 See supra text accompanying notes 118-19. 282 See supra text accompanying note 125. 283 In fields like chemistry, results are often unpredictable because a PHOSITA often must engage in trial and error to figure out what works and what does not. See Cedarapids, Inc. v. Nordberg, Inc., No. 95-1529, 1997 WL 452801, at *2 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 11, 1997) (explaining that in the chemical arts, \"a slight variation . . . can yield an unpredictable result or may not work at all\"); In re Wright, 999 F.2d 1557, 1564 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (testing enablement by determining if a skilled scientist would have reasonably believed that the inventor's success with the described embodiment(s) \"could be extrapolated with a reasonable expectation of success\" to other 2016] Patent Asymmetries 1005 contends that a PHOSITA would have to engage in undue experimentation to elucidate which citrus oils work, as well as the proper ratios of citrus oil, mineral oil, and white vinegar to achieve the claimed result (wood cleaning). 284 At this point the burden shifts to the applicant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the PHOSITA's knowledge in combination with the applicant's teaching can actually enable the full scope of the claim. 285 In response, the applicant argues that a well- trained chemist would know where to look in the scientific literature and could use trial and error to figure out what works. 286 The examiner determines that the proffered evidence is insufficient to rebut the prima facie case of nonenablement because it is not a \"persuasive argument[], supported by suitable [evidence] where necessary, that [a PHOSITA] would be able to make and use the claimed invention using the application as a guide.\" 287 At this point, examination could take two paths. Consider first the scenario in which the applicant is unable or unwilling to produce the requisite evidence. Mindful of the burden of proof, the applicant voluntarily cancels the broad generic claim (to all citrus oils) and pursues a narrower subgenus claim (covering a handful of citrus oils similar to lemon oil). The examiner would allow this claim. Importantly, the applicant obtains a much narrower patent than that which probably would have issued under the current regime. Now consider a scenario in which the applicant can adduce additional proof of patentability \u2014 most likely experimental details for more citrus oils. As far as the burden is concerned, the additional technical information would provide more enablement and allow the applicant to obtain a patent with claims covering additional citrus oils (but still narrower than what was originally sought). The proposed embodiments encompassed by the claims). 284 See supra text accompanying notes 125-31. 285 The scope of enablement is the sum of what is taught in the patent document plus what is known to a PHOSITA without undue experimentation. Nat'l Recovery Techs., Inc. v. Magnetic Separation Sys., Inc., 166 F.3d 1190, 1196 (Fed. Cir. 1999). 286 Applicants often respond to enablement rejections by stating that \"a patent need not teach, and preferably omits, what is well known in the art.\" See Hybritech, Inc. v. Monoclonal Antibodies, Inc., 802 F.2d 1367, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 1986). But that oft-repeated statement \"is merely a rule of supplementation, not a substitute for a basic enabling disclosure.\" Genentech, Inc. v. Novo Nordisk, A/S, 108 F.3d 1361, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cited with in Corp. v. Andrx Pharms., LLC, 603 F.3d 935, supra Davis [Vol. 49:963 supplementation rule would permit the applicant to incorporate the additional technical information into the patent document.288 And to be clear, the supplementation rule would not allow the applicant to include post-filing inventive activity \u2014 only evidence that shows the state of the art or otherwise proves enablement as of the filing date sought. B. Theoretical Justifications 1. The Prima Facie Case of Unpatentability Recall that under the current regime, the examiner bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of unpatentability. 289 Once established, the burden of production shifts to the applicant to rebut the inference of unpatentability by a preponderance of the evidence.290 If sufficient rebuttal evidence is produced, the inference \"is dissipated\" 291 and the examiner must consider all of the facts in evidence \u2014 including those adduced during later stages of prosecution \u2014 before drawing a final conclusion as to patentability. 292 Insufficient rebuttal evidence, however, compels a conclusion of unpatentability.293 The proposed framework retains the prima facie case as a procedural device for several reasons. First, in ex parte matters, it serves as an orderly mechanism for initially producing evidence 294 and developing the written record of the proceedings before the PTO.295 The Federal Circuit defends the prima facie case because of this information- gathering function: 288 See supra Part III.A.1. 289 See supra note 105 and accompanying text. 290 In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1445 at 1445 (\"[T]he ultimate determination made the entire record.\"); Piasecki , 745 at 1472 prima facie inference is rebutted, \"the examiner must consider all anew\"); In re Rinehart, 531 F.2d 1048, fixated on the prima facie case or \"to provide that decision with an undeservedly broadened umbrella effect\"). 293 See 1 C HRISTOPHER B. MUELLER & LAIRD C. KIRKPATRICK , FEDERAL EVIDENCE \u00a7 3:6, at 438-43 (3d ed. 2007) (describing the function of the presumptions). 294 Piasecki , 745 F.2d at 1472; see also In re Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 710 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (en banc) (\"[T]he principle underlying orderly patent examination is that the burden in the first instance is on the examiner to establish that the claimed invention is prima facie unpatentable . . (Fed. Cir. 1997). 2016] Patent Asymmetries 1007 [I]ts purpose is simply to provide sufficient notice to the applicant to facilitate his effective submission of information. Since the applicant is in the best position to cheaply provide information about the purported invention, the PTO's authority to shift the burden to obtain this information [after the prima facie case it met] is crucial to ensure that the PTO is not mak[ing] patentability determinations on insufficient facts and information. 296 Second, an applicant should know clearly and specifically why the invention is putatively unpatentable.297 It would make little sense for the examiner to \"sit mum, leaving the applicant to shoot arrows into the dark hoping to somehow hit a secret objection harbored by the examiner.\"298 Finally, the prima facie case mitigates arbitrariness to the extent that it prevents the PTO from denying patents without a sufficient factual basis. 299 2. Shifting the Burden of Persuasion to the Inventor The principal significance of the burden of persuasion is to \"indicate[] which party must satisfy the decisionmaker in order to avoid losing on a given issue.\" 300 Where the burden rests can depend upon the existence of a presumption since the latter can assign the former.301 This is the case in patent law because assigning the burden of persuasion to the PTO stems from the presumption of patentability. 302 So eliminating the presumption makes it easier to shift the burden of persuasion to the applicant. 296 Hyatt v. Dudas, 492 F.3d 1365, 1370 , 977 F.2d at 1449 299 Id.; see also supra Part II.A.1 (arguing that the current presumption of patentability is justified in part by the fear of PTO arbitrariness). 300 A GUIDE TO FEDERAL AGENCY ADJUDICATION 68 (Michael Asimow ed., 2003); cf. Tech. Licensing Corp. v. Videotek, Inc., 545 F.3d 1316, 1326 (Fed Cir. 2008) (\"[T]he burden of persuasion . . . is the ultimate burden assigned to a party who must prove something to a specified degree of certainty . . . .\"). 301 See 2 K ENNETH S. BROUN ET AL ., MCCORMICK ON EVIDENCE \u00a7 343, at 500 (6th ed. 2006); Ronald J. Allen, Presumptions in Civil Actions Reconsidered , 66 I OWA L. REV. 843, 845 (1981). Presumptions themselves are often \"created by courts and by legislatures to accomplish various objectives or policies.\" Mason Ladd, Presumptions in Civil Actions , 1977 A RIZ. ST. L.J. 275, 279. 302 See In re Epstein, 32 F.3d 1559, 1570 (Fed. Cir. Oetiker 1967). 1008 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 This shift is consistent with the scholarly literature on evidence. At first glance this might seem surprising because the burden of persuasion often rests with the same party that carries the initial burden of production. 303 Yet this is not a hard-and-fast rule. Evidence scholars have long urged that there is no single overarching principle which dictates how the burden of persuasion should be assigned.304 Rather, it may depend upon a myriad of factors.305 Two common factors \u2014 both of which are relevant for patent examination \u2014 are access to proof and substantive policy considerations. 306 A doctrine has emerged which assigns the burden of persuasion to a party if it has superior information needed to prove an issue, even if that party does not bear the initial burden of producing evidence.307 The Supreme Court recognizes and applies this doctrine because \"considerations of fairness\" require allocation to a party if the facts needed to establish an issue lie \"peculiarly within [that party's] knowledge.\" 308 This happens in negligence cases, for example, where 303 BROUN ET AL ., supra note 301, \u00a7 337, at 477; 21B C HARLES ALAN WRIGHT & KENNETH W.

N.Y., New Haven & Hartford R.R. Co., 355 U.S. 253, 256 2016] Patent Asymmetries 1009 some courts applying res ipsa loquitur will shift the burden of persuasion to the defendant when the plaintiff is disadvantaged by the defendant's superior access to relevant information. 309 Several commentators have argued that the superior information doctrine also makes sense from an economic perspective.310 In the patent examination context, the applicant has superior information about the invention.311 This is why the PTO implements disclosure rules to help minimize its information deficit.312 The applicant is often the \"cheapest cost provider\"313 vis-\u00e0-vis the PTO when it comes to furnishing information for examination.314 For these reasons, the superior information doctrine should be considered as a factor in reallocating the burden of persuasion to the applicant. Another important factor for allocating the burden of persuasion is the policy goal of the underlying substantive law.315 Absent clear direction from Congress, the federal courts will allocate the burden in n.5 (1957); see also WIGMORE , supra note at 290 (noting \"peculiar means of knowledge\" as a factor to consider in assigning the burden). 309 W.

Other things being equal, the lower one party's relative costs, the stronger the argument for giving him the burden of proof.\"). A similar argument can be made for a party that has greater resources. See Richard A. Posner, An Economic Approach to the Law of Evidence , 51 S TAN. L. REV. 1477, 1543 (1999) (arguing that burdens of production and persuasion are economizing devices and should therefore be assigned to the party with greatest access to resources). 311 See discussion supra Part II.B. 312 See supra note 219. 313 Jason Rantanen & Lee Petherbridge, Toward a System of Invention Registration: The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act , 110 M ICH.

Some commentators suggest that this may be the most important factor. See MUELLER & KIRKPATRICK , supra note 293, \u00a7 3:3, at 431 (\"First and perhaps most important, burdens are allocated to serve substantive policy . . . .\"); W RIGHT \u00a7 5122, at 402 (\"In determining the placement of burdens of proof, courts begin with the policy of the substantive law . . . .\"). 1010 University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 a manner consistent with their perceptions of good policy.316 Eliminating the presumption of patentability and allocating the burden of persuasion to the applicant could be used to modulate applicant behavior and promote certain policy objectives of the patent system. 317 C. The Benefits of Symmetry 1. Improved Patent Quality The quality of an issued patent depends on the quality of the underlying PTO examination.318 This Article has shown that three asymmetries tip the scales of patentability so far in the applicant's favor that quality is inevitably compromised. My proposal would eliminate the proof asymmetry. Requiring applicants to establish patentability would necessarily mitigate the information asymmetry. While the proposal would not relieve the examiner of establishing a prima facie case of unpatentability, 319 placing the burden of persuasion on the applicant combined with eliminating the presumption of patentability would compel the applicant (rather than the examiner) to furnish information to carry the burden of proof and ultimately prevail. 320 If the applicant could not do so, a patent would not issue.321 But even if the applicant prevails, the resulting patent would be of higher quality (vis-\u00e0-vis one that would have issued under the current regime) because furnishing more information to the examiner should lead to a more robust examination. 322 Adopting the proposal would also ameliorate the legal asymmetry. The new proof paradigm would force the applicant to disclose more technical information about the invention to carry the burden of proof, 323 allowing the examiner to evaluate patentability based on 316 Allen, Presumptions, Inferences , supra note 307, at 898. 317 See infra Part III.C. 318 See supra note 202 and accompanying text. 319 See supra Part III.B.1. 320 See supra Part III.A. 321 One might ask if the applicant could simply file continuation applications or RCEs to prolong prosecution. Doing so would be pointless because the applicant still faces the affirmative burden of proving patentability. Put differently, the proposed regime completely changes the examiner-applicant dynamic \u2014 strategies like \"wearing down the examiner\" would be less fruitful. 322 See discussion supra Part II.B, para. 1. 323 See supra text accompanying note 320. 2016] Patent Asymmetries 1011 objective evidence and lessening the need to consider dubious legal arguments. As above, this new regime would lead to a more technically robust patent examination and improve the quality of issued patents. Here it is important to note that the proposal would not place additional burdens on the examiner or the PTO. This is very important given the PTO's chronic funding concerns. 324 My proposal accepts the normative idea that \"[i]mproving examination efficiency and patent quality should be a 'mutually shared responsibility' of both the PTO and patent applicants.\" 325 I contend that modifying the evidentiary rules of patent examination to rebalance the scales of patentability would achieve this result and promote other policy goals of the patent system. 2. Modulating Inventor Behavior The proposed regime would clearly affect inventor-filing behavior. Lacking a presumption of patentability and faced with the ultimate burden of proof, inventors with trivial or underdeveloped inventions might realize that pursuing a patent would be a waste of time and money. 326 This would leave the inventor with two options. The first option would be to not file at all. Perhaps the invention would be technically infeasible or unlikely to gain much attention in the marketplace.327 Or perhaps the potential value of a conceived idea is not great enough to justify the expense of adducing sufficient proof for an inevitable fight over patentability. 328 324 The PTO is entirely funded by user fees; however, it collects more fee revenue each year than Congress appropriates.

To illustrate, consider the general rule under the AIA that any disclosure by a third party before the inventor's filing date will ordinarily defeat patentability. 344 Yet a third-party disclosure will not qualify as prior art if, within one year of filing, either the inventor had already disclosed the invention before the third party 345 or the third party somehow derived its disclosure from the inventor.346 Under this more certainty as to the invention's ultimate commercial worth.\" Id.

University of California, Davis [Vol. 49:963 landscape inventors will have two low-cost options to secure an early filing date: to file a provisional patent application347 or to simply make a pre-filing disclosure.348 The ultimate choice of whether or when to file or disclose will depend on the inventor's overall patenting strategy.349 CONCLUSION It is far too easy to get a (bad) patent. I have argued that low-quality patents issue not simply because of poor decision-making or policy choices by the PTO but because of a confluence of proof, information, and legal asymmetries that exist in the current patent examination paradigm. The proof asymmetry causes the most mischief because the presumption of patentability and locution of the burden of persuasion puts the applicant in a favorable position from the very outset of patent examination. This imbalance exacerbates the other asymmetries to the extent that anyone who files a patent application on anything will eventually get a patent. The situation is much different under the proposed regime, which rebalances the scales of patentability. By eliminating the presumption of patentability and placing a heavy evidentiary burden upon the applicant, all three asymmetries essentially disappear. Getting a patent would be far from guaranteed and inventors 347 A provisional patent application allows an inventor to obtain an early filing date for the invention before the inventor is ready to draft a claim or a full application. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(b). A provisional application is not examined and only requires a minimal filing fee. See id. The inventor must, however, submit a regular, \"nonprovisional\" application within one year, or the provisional is automatically abandoned. See \u00a7 119(e)(1). In short, the provisional patent provides an easy and inexpensive mode of entry into the U.S. patent system. 348 See Dennis Crouch, Disclosure Under the AIA: Introducing The Poor Man's Provisional Patent Application , PATENTLY -O (Sep. 21, 2011), http://patentlyo.com/patent/2011/09/ disclosure-under-the-aia-the-poor-mans-provisional-patent-application.html (explaining that early public disclosure is \"a really poor man's provisional application\" because it \"allows an applicant to buy an additional year of delay with few capital expenditures and without losing patent term but instead merely shifting the term forward in time\"). 349 An important constraint on a provisional application is that it must include a written description which satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 112. New Railhead Mfg., LLC v. Vermeer Mfg. Co., 298 F.3d 1290, 1294 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Also, a pre-filing disclosure might cause problems for inventors who contemplate filing abroad. The one-year grace period available in the United States is not available in many foreign countries. See Convention on the Grant of European Patents arts. 54-55, Oct. 5, 1973, 1065 U.N.T.S. 255, 272. Most of them have an absolute novelty requirement such that any pre-filing disclosure, including activity by the inventor, is patent-defeating. Id. art. 54. Accordingly, if foreign filing is a possibility, the applicant must take steps to avoid inadvertent or premature disclosure. 2016] Patent Asymmetries 1015 with dubious inventions might forego seeking a patent or choose to perfect their inventions before filing. Thus, this regime would improve patent quality and promote broader goals of patent policy. "}
