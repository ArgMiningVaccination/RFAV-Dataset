Often disregarded in these initiatives, however, are the special ne eds of vulnerable populations during disasters. In the context of emergencies, vulnerable groups may include individuals with disabilities, pregnant women, children, elderly persons, prisoners, certain members of ethnic minorities, people with language barriers, and the impoverished. The fate of the disadvantaged during disasters has received little attentio n in the legal literature, and this Article begins to fill that gap. Through an examination of normative distributive justice arguments, exis ting federal and state civil rights provisions, and emergency response laws , it argues that existing legal and ethical frameworks entitle vulnerable populations to significant protection. It also, however, highlights the shor tcomings of the current statutory scheme as it relates to the needs of the disadvantaged during disasters and urges legislators to supplement these laws with additional requirements. Moreover, the Article argues that for vulnerable populations, successful disaster response is dependent upon careful planning. With this in mind, the Article develops a proposal for statutory provisions that will mandate adequate preparation to safeguard th e welfare of the vulnerable in emergencies.

During and after a catastrophic event, vulnerable populations may include individuals with disabilities, pregnant women, children, the elderly, prisoners, ethnic minorities, people with language barriers, and the impoverished. 5 A r e v i e w o f 1 Dennis P.

The disadvantaged could suffer large death tolls, as illustrated by Hurricane Katrina, in which over 1,800 individuals died because they were unable to evacuate the city.8 The infirm elderly, poor, and disabled were the most likely to die in that notorious disaster.9 Members of vulnerable populations who survive could suffer permanent, debilitating injuries and become unable to work, live independently, and care for themselves. American taxpayers who pay for public safety-net programs would thus absorb the cost of increased use of such programs and loss of economic productivity. As demonstrated in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, a failed emergency response could also cause the government to suffer humiliation and the public to lose faith in those responsible for its welfare. 10 These prospects are alarming given the variety of potential emergencies that experts predict we will face in the SERVS., AT-RISK POPULATIONS AND PANDEMIC INFLUENZA : PLANNING GUIDANCE FOR STATE, TERRITORIAL , TRIBAL , AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS 3-4 (2008), available http:// www.astho.org/pubs/ASTHO_ARPP_Guidan ce_June3008.pdf [hereinafter ASTHO]; HEALTH SYS.

In 2006, approximate ly 35.5 million individuals were sixty-five years of age or older 14 and 38.8 million Americans were living in poverty.15 Children constitute approximately twenty-five percent of the United States population.16 Meanwhile, at the end of 2007, approximately 2.3 million individuals were incarcerated in United States prisons and jails. 17 Some subset of each of these groups will almost certainly have speci al needs during disasters.

Their poor outcomes may be linked to lack of physical and emotional strength or a dearth of the social and economic resources upon which others rely during disasters. Re sponse and recovery efforts will be optimized only if decision makers have carefully prepared for emergencies at a time when they have the leisure to contemplate options and establish responsible policies. However, planning and production of planning documents alone are not sufficient to achieve comprehensive and effective disaster readiness. Rather, at a minimum, planners must identify at-risk individuals through registries, delegate authority and responsibility to appropriate governmental officials, collect supplies, and allocate resources, among other steps. 19 Consequently, the terms \"planning\" an d \"preparation\" in this Article are meant to include not only the contemplation of response approaches, but also the implementation of readiness initiatives. Without appropriate preparation, vulnerable individuals may not be able to evacuate as instructed, reach points of distribution for medical countermeasures, understand written or verbal communications during an emergency, or find suitable housing if their residences are destroyed during a disaster. For example, while all residents of affected areas were failed by the response to Hurricane Katrina, the vulnerable often suffered to a much greater extent than others. The hearing impaired found that eighty percent of shelters did not have text telephones (\"TTYs\"); sixty percent of shelters had no television with open caption capability; only fifty-six percent of shelters posted announcements that were otherwise made verbally; and American Sign Language interpreters were availabl e in fewer than thirty percent of shelters. 20 Meanwhile, low-income African Americans often could not evacuate because they had no personal transportation.21 Furthermore, those with mobility impairments found that only five percent of the temporary housing provided by the Federal Emergency Management available at http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nrf /nrf-core.pdf (identifying \"three phases of effective response\" as \"prepare, respond, and recover\"). 19 See infra Part IV.B for recommendations. 20 NAT'L COUNCIL ON DISABILITY , THE IMPACT OF HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA ON PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES : A LOOK BACK AND REMAINING CHALLENGES 14 (2006), available at http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/pub lications/2006/pdf/ hurricanes_impact. pdf; PAUL CAMPBELL ET AL ., HARVARD SCH.

This Article introduces legal analysis into the discussion of preparedness for vulnerable populations.23 Numerous civil rights laws establish that vulnerable populations have a right to be free of discrimination and to enjoy certain benefits and governmental protections. 24 These rights and obligations are binding not only during ordinary times, but also during emergencies. Nevertheless, the existing legal framework must be supplemented by specific provis ions in emergency response laws that mandate disaster planning to address the needs of vulnerable populations. Preparation for the needs of vulnerable groups is most likely to occur if it is statutorily mandated. These groups often have weak political voices 25 and may not become a focus for governmental planners without laws requiring agencies to expressly account for the vulnerable. This Article develops recommendations for federal and state law provisions that require sp ecific planning activities designed to safeguard the welfare of the disadvantaged.26 It also explores ethical theories of distributive justice that address how the government should allocate scarce resources.27 While the government may not be able to anticipate and address every need of all vulnerable groups, experts agree that certain initiatives can improve outcomes for the vulnerable.28 For example, much can be accomplished by working with advocacy and community groups and by requiring private vendors who supply services during disasters to accommodate the needs of vulnerable groups. In addition, officials must communicate effectively with all segments of society to educate the public about what individuals must do for themselves during emergencies. 29 State 22 CAMPBELL ET AL ., supra note 20, at 9. 23 See infra Part III. 24 See infra Part III.A. 25 Sylvia A.

The Article proceeds as follows. Part I addresses the question of who \"vulnerable populations\" are in the context of disasters. It identifies and assesses the needs of numerous at-risk groups. Part II turns to ethical questions concerning how resources should be allocated in the process of planning for and responding to disasters. This Part explores whether there are moral justifications for investing disproportionate resources in accommodating the needs of the disadvantaged. In so doing, it presents several theories of distributive justice 30 and analyzes how they illuminate the question of resource allocation for vulnerable populations. Part III examines a variety of federal and state laws that establish nondiscrimination mandates and other obligations that public and private entities have towards vulnerable populations. These in clude federal and state disability laws, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and similar state laws, and the tort of negligence. These laws reflect a long-standing commitment to protecting the rights of the vulnerable. This Part then presents a comprehensive survey of existing federal and state emergency response laws that include provisions addressing special needs communities. Part IV, the recommendations section, first argues that the existing statutory scheme constitutes a patchwork characterized by many gaps and shortcomings. To address these shortcomings, I then develop a prop osal for statutory revisions that will more effectively safeguard th e interests of the disadvantaged during disasters. Only with appropriate planning and resources will the vulnerable be able to survive and thrive after disasters. Such preparation is of critical import ance based on ethical, legal, and practical considerations. I. V ULNERABLE POPULATIONS Vulnerable populations, also called \"special needs\" populations31 or \"at-risk\" populations,32 are those that are particularly \"at risk of poor 30 Distributive justice is concerned with the proper allocation of resources, benefits, and rewards.

These include (1) individuals with physical and mental disabilities, (2) elderly persons, (3) pregnant women, (4) children, (5) prisoners, (6) economically disadvantaged minorities, (7) undocumented workers, and (8) those with language barriers. 37 This Part analyzes the vulnerabilities of each group. A. Individuals with Disabilities Large-scale disasters may leave indi viduals with physical and mental disabilities particularly challenged and helpless. Governmental assistance may be inadequate and may end too quickly after a disaster to meet the needs of the disabled.38 Individuals with physical disabilities may be underserved in a va riety of ways during a disaster. For example, those with hearing impairments may not be able to understand evacuation orders or instructions provided in shelters.39 1(b)(4) (2006) (using term \"at-risk individuals\"). 33 LU ANN ADAY, AT RISK IN AMERICA : THE HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES 4 (2d ed. 2001).

These are not theoretical difficulties. A report by the National Council on Disability concerning Hurricanes Katrina and Rita highlights these concerns. It provides accounts of individuals turned away from shelters, forced to sleep in their wheelchairs, and housed in inappropriate conditions, where they developed debilitating bedsores and other medical problems. 42 After emergencies, individuals with disabilities may also find it more difficult to secure accessible apartments or trailers, health care, appropriate schooling, and employment in areas that have been devastated by a disaster. 43 Those with mental disabilities may also face acute difficulties in emergencies. Their evacuation may be mismanaged by emergency responders who misunderstand their behavior or are uncomfortable with them, and shelters may refuse to accept them or be ill equipped to meet their needs. 44 Individuals with mental disabilities may receive rough treatment if they are unable to follow instructions45 and be inappropriately institutionalized as a convenient solution.46 After Hurricane Katrina, FEMA reportedly refused to provide trailers to some individuals with known mental health histories even though they were capable of living independently.47 Some mentally ill survivors were not able to fill ou t complicated hous ing applications and were not provided adequate assistance.48 In add ition, untraine d FEMA officials assessed others as too disabled to live on their own.49 Without appropriate planning that anticipates and accommodates the 40 Id. at 5. 41 Id. at 11. 42 Id. at 13-14. 43 Id. at 15-21. 44 See id . at 3-4. 45 See id. at 12. 46 NAT'L COUNCIL ON DISABILITY , supra note 38, at 18-20. 47 Id. at 7. 48 Id. 49 Id. 2009] Preparing for Disaster 1501 needs of the physically and mentally disabled, these populations are likely to be underserved in disasters and consequently suffer poor outcomes. B. Elderly Persons Individuals who are sixty-five or ol der are more likely than others to suffer from chronic diseases, including arthritis, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory ailments. 50 Eighty percent of adults in this age group have at least one chronic illness, and fifty percent have two or more chronic conditions.51 Older adults may also suffer from mobility, cognitive, sensory, social, and economic limitations that can impede their adaptability and ability to function in disasters.52 As a result, they may become agitated, overwhelmed, and traumatized. 53 Additionally, during emergencies and in their aftermaths, the health of older adults can deteriorate because of poor nutrition, extreme temperatures, exposure to infection, interruptions in medical treatment, and emotional distress. 54 Among individuals with disabilities, those who are elderly may require particular attention and support because of their frailties. C. Pregnant Women Pregnant women will also have sp ecial needs and face increased risks during disasters. These include premature deliveries, underweight infants, and infant mortality. 55 Some women may have to deliver babies without the benefit of hospital care.56 Pregnant women also run the risk of being evacuated without access to medical records containing information critical to their welfare or that of their 50 Nancy Aldrich & William F.

Furthermore, if relief workers are unaware of women's pregnancies, they might include them in mass vaccination or other prophylactic programs contraindicated for pregnant individuals. 59 D. Children Children are a vulnerable population because of their susceptibility to injury and their dependence on others for livelihood, decision making, and emotional support.60 Studies have shown that children who are injured by explosions are at greater risk of significant trauma than are adults. 61 Children may also suffer greater harm from exposure to bioterrorism agents because of their size, metabolisms, respiratory rates, and other factors.62 Moreover, the physiological differences between children and adults are numerous, relating to head and tongue size in proportion to other body parts, nerve conduction, ventilation, oxygen demand, circulating blood flow, vulnerability of the liver and spleen, and skin thickness. 63 Children are likely to develop dehydration, malnutrition, and exhaustion more quickly than adults, and they are more susceptible to infectious 57 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Critical Needs in Caring for Pregnant Women During Times of Disaster for Non-Obstetric Health Care Providers, http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters /pregnantdisasterhcp.asp (l ast visited Feb. 21, 2009). 58 Id. 59 William M.

In addition, caring for children in an emergency involves psychological and social challenges stemming from their level of cognitive ability, emotional vulnerability, and dependence upon the support of family members. 65 Thus, treatment that would be adequate for adults might be negligent or even grossly negligent66 if administered to children. For example, children need different medication dosages and medical equipment sizes than adults, and the water pressure used to decontaminate 67 older people who are exposed to chemical releases is inappropriate for young children.68 According to one study, fewer than fifty percent of emergency medicine programs that responded to a terrorism preparedness survey reported having adequate training relating to child victims. 69 In addition, there are comparatively few pediatric hospital beds, pediatric specialists, or providers with expertise in caring for children. 70 Children require special attention an d procedures during disasters, and they are often identified as a population that should be prioritized during relief efforts. For example, a government guidance document concerning the allocation of pandemic influenza vaccines reported that an essential priority of vaccine programs should be to protect children. 71 Yet, despite these initiatives, many agree that those 64 OLNESS ET AL ., supra note 56, at 35. 65 Fendya, supra note 61, at 164-65. 66 Gross negligence is \"an intentional fa ilure to perform a manifest duty in reckless disregard of the consequences as affecting the life or property of another.\" Marriott Corp. v.

Prisoners Because they are in custody, prisoners are entirely dependent upon governmental authorities for their welfare during a disaster, and, therefore, they too are a vulnerable population. Prisoners cannot evacuate on their own, seek medical care, or obtain food, shelter, and supplies unless authorities provide these to them. 73 Furthermore, in the chaos of an emergency, inmates could be subject to attacks by fellow prisoners or poorly trained, panicked guards. 74 Events in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina illustrate just how vulnerable prisoners are during disasters. The American Civil Liberties Union (\"ACLU\") issued a 2006 report entitled Abandoned and Abused , which describes the shocking conditions prisoners in the Orleans Parish Prison (\"OPP\") faced during and after Hurricane Katrina. 75 The following excerpt from the ACLU report vividly illustrates the dangers prisoners can face during a disaster: As floodwaters rose in the O PP Buildings, power was lost, and entire buildings were plunged into darkness. Deputies left their posts wholesale, leaving behind prisoners in locked cells, some standing in sewage-tainted water up to their chests. Over the next few days, without food, water, or ventilation, prisoners broke windows in order to get air, and carved holes in the jail's walls in an effort to get to safety. . . . Once freed from the buildings, prisoners were bused to receiving facilities around the state, . . .

Economically Disadvantaged Mino rities, Undocumented Workers, and Individuals with Language Barriers Economically and socially disadvantaged individuals are likely to suffer disproportionate harm from disasters because they lack resources and adequate support systems. 80 Two disasters within the past two decades illustrate the problems facing those with socioeconomic disadvantages. In 1995, over 700 people died during a weeklong heat wave in Chicago. 81 African Americans were one-and-a- half times more likely to die than whites because they were impoverished, segregated, and lacked \"social capital.\"82 Ten years later, during Hurricane Katrina, the majority of those who remained in New Orleans were African Americans, and 21,787 black households reportedly had no car with which to evacuate the city.83 Communication barriers compounded their problems, as residents who followed television broadcasts received untimely and contradictory evacuation instructions from authorities.84 In addition, African-American refugees were not always welcomed by other communities.85 At one point, a large group of mostly black refugees 77 JEFFREY A.

Even efforts to translate communications might fail if translators do not pay careful attention to the nuances of language and to words, phrases, and concepts that cannot faithfully be translated from English to other languages. 95 Furthermore, efforts to distribute information to minorities through the Internet will be ineffective for those without computer access or sophisticated computer skills. 96 As this Part has made clear, there are many populations whose dependencies make them vulnerable to disproportionate harm during disasters. But should society devote resources to protect these vulnerable groups during emergencies? The next Part explores normative responses to this question. II. N ORMATIVE ARGUMENTS Emergency preparedness for vulnerable populations raises challenging ethical questions. In the midst of a disaster, how should limited resources be allocated? To what extent should the needs of vulnerable populations be prioritized? For example, if health care providers are overwhelmed by a demand for medical care, should patients be treated simply on a first-come, first-served basis? Should patients be selected for treatment based on their anticipated prognosis? Should patients' social worth be considered in resource allocation decisions? Even the most prominent ethicists acknowledge that these problems are unresolved and have no easy solutions. 97 The intractability of these question s has not prevented scholars and philosophers from proffering answers. This Part briefly explores several approaches to distributive justice, including utilitarianism, 93 INT'L HUMAN RIGHTS LAW CLINIC , UNIV. OF CAL., BERKELEY SCH.

Rather, this Part shows that the difficulty in determining how to allocate scarce resources during disasters necessitates advanced planning. Planning before catastrophic events have struck will diminish the need for government agencies to make difficult moral choices in the midst of emergencies. A. Utilitarianism According to utilitarian principles, actions are appropriate if they produce the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people. 99 Actions need not have simila r or identical consequences for all impacted individuals; rather, they must achieve the maximum overall benefit.100 In the context of triage, the principle of utility might translate into a policy of attempting to save the greatest number of lives and thus to direct treatment to those who are most likely to benefit from it.101 For example, health care providers may withhold medical resources from individuals considered unlikely to benefit 98 See supra note 30. 99 J.J. C. SMART & BERNARD WILLIAMS , UTILITARIANISM FOR AND AGAINST 30, 47 (1973) (explaining that under ut ilitarianism action A is to be chosen over action B if doing A will make mankind happier than doing B and if probable benefit will be maximized); John C.

WINSLOW , TRIAGE AND JUSTICE 63-70 (1982). The auth or outlines five \"ranking principles for triage\": U-1. The principle of medical success. Priority given to those for whom treatment has the highest probability of medical success. U-2. The principle of immediate usefulness. Priority given to the most useful under the immediate circumstances. U-3. The principle of conservation. Pr iority given to those who require proportionately smaller amounts of the resources. U-4. The principle of parental role. Priority given to those who have the largest responsibilities to dependents. U-5. The principle of general social value. Priority given to those believed to have the greatest general social worth.

Such individuals include those with complicating factors or circumstances that prevent people from thriving, complying with medical protocols, or caring for themselves after treatment, such as multiple illnesses, drug or alcohol abuse, homelessness, or social or behavioral problems.102 Furthermore, providers might deny care to injured patients who require considerable resources because of und erlying infirmities or disabilities in order to save multiple patients who are healthier and require less treatment.103 Utilitarian principles might militate against prioritizing care for the disadvantaged in an emergency if such individuals would require a disproportionate amount of resources. Not all philosophers embrace ut ilitarianism principles. Some commentators criticize utilitariani sm on at least three grounds. 104 First, utilitarianism may lead to results that defy moral and ethical values. For example, at its extrem es, utilitarianism might lead one to justify killing a single individual in order to transplant her organs in others, saving multiple lives. 105 Second, it can be difficult to predict who will actually benefit most from treatment and who will live the most valuable lives posttreatment.106 Third, even assuming the ability to predict these subsequent deve lopments, utilitarianism requires unpalatable assumptions about the valu e of one life over another. For example, is the life of a quadriplegic patient less worth saving than the life of a nondisabled person? How can we assume that the quadriplegic individual does not derive as much pleasure from living, has a shorter life expectancy, or cannot contribute as much to society as others? What if the quadriplegic individual is Stephen Hawking? By contrast, what if the able-bodied person who is saved instead of the quadriplegic is a reckless driver prone to causing life-threatening accidents? Thus, utilitarianism can raise as many questions about distributive justice as it answers. 102 Asha V.

Equal Chances A second approach to distributive justice is the principle of equal chances. This principle requires health care providers to give each individual an equal chance to survive on the theory that each person's life is equally valuable to him or her.107 This approach rejects the utilitarian argument that decision makers should calculate the sum of all anticipated benefits and burdens at issue in making treatment determinations.108 The philosopher John Taurek presented the following example to illustrate the theory of equal chances: I have a supply of some life-savi ng drug. Six people will all certainly die if they are not treated with the drug. But one of the six requires all of the drug if he is to survive. Each of the other five requires only one-fifth of the drug. What ought I to do? 109 Taurek concludes that he should give each person an equal chance to survive and flip a coin to decide whether to give the drug to the one person who needs all of it or to the five who need only a fraction of the available amount. 110 The individual requiring all of the medication, like the other five, would have a fifty-fifty likelihood of being saved. 111 For purposes of establishing a disaster triaging policy, Taurek's philosophy would require a first-come, first-served process by which all treatable patients who arrive while resources are available would be given identical priority regardless of whether they need very intensive care or much more limited treatment. 112 In the alternative, a lottery system could be established.113 Critics of Taurek's philosophy argue that allowing many to perish in order to save the few is irrational. For example, in an essay entitled Why the Numbers Should Sometimes Count , John Saunders presents a hypothetical in which there is a choice between saving a single life and saving ten billion lives. 114 Saunders asks whether even in these 107 Id. at 286. 108 Id. 109 John M.

Saunders, Why the Numbers Should Sometimes Count , 17 PHIL. & PUB. 2009] Preparing for Disaster 1511 circumstances, Taurek would give the same priority to the single individual as to the ten billion. He argues that if human beings are valuable as human beings, it is only right to attempt to save as many of them as possible and to \"count the numbers.\"115 Still, the equal chances principle ra ises thought-provoking questions as to whether, in the face of scarce resources, the default rule should be to try to save the many and sacrifice the few who need the most care. Do decision makers have a ri ght to establish priorities based on value judgments concerning the worth of human lives? Those who are denied care likely have a fierce will to live and see their lives as immeasurably valuable. Thus, they will suffer intensely from the knowledge that they have been doomed to die while others are saved. The equal chances theory does not support prioritizing the vulnerable over other disaster victims. Rather, it establishes an ethical nondiscrimination mandate that forbids deeming the disadvantaged to be less eligible for rescue based on the medical, social, or economic resources that they may require during and after disasters. C. The Best Outcome for the Least Well Off A third normative argument, the theory of \"the best outcome for the least well off,\" supports prioritizing the needs of vulnerable populations over others. Disadvan taged members of society will likely suffer disproportionate harm in disasters because of poverty, disabilities, isolation, and lack of resources with which to survive and recover. 116 According to this theory, authorities should distribute limited resources unequally in order to maximize benefits for the least well off.117 Consequently, the least advantaged members of society would receive maximum benefits so that death \u2014 the worst outcome and the one most likely to be suffered by the disadvantaged \u2014 is avoided if at all possible. 118 John Rawls articulates the rationale behind this approach in A Theory of Justice .119 Rawls outlines the principles of justice that AFF. 3, 3-4 (1988). 115 Id. at 13. 116 Farber, supra note 80, at 321 (\"[T]he social disadvantages our society treats as ordinary and unremarkable become deadly in dramatic ways during the course of a disaster.\"). 117 W INSLOW , supra note 101, at 92-98 (discussing approaches of prioritizing medically neediest and those who are genera lly neediest and most helpless); Moskop & Iserson, 99, at 285. 118 Moskop & Iserson, supra note 99, at 285. 119 See generally JOHN RAWLS , A THEORY OF JUSTICE (1999). 1512 University of California, Davis [Vol. 42:1491 hypothetical decision makers would choose were they operating behind a \"veil of ignorance.\"120 These decision makers would not know their own specific circumstances in life, such as their social status, personal strengths, and weaknesses. Consequently, the decision makers would not be prejudiced by their own agendas and expectations in life.121 Rawls argues that the veil of ignorance would promote procedural justice and woul d prevent decision makers from exploiting people's diverse social and personal circumstances for their own advantage.122 Rawls further hypothesizes that these decision makers would wish to maximize benefits for the worst off in the hope of ensuring their own good outcomes if they themselves were to fare poorly one day. 123 Thus, Rawls posits a \"difference principle,\"124 according to which unequal distribution of wealth and income is permissible only if it is to the advantage of those who are least fortunate. 125 Emergencies involving illness and injuries, however, may complicate this approach. The worst off will presumably be the sickest, and their risk of death will be highest. Thus, it is arguably irrational to plan to expend sizeable medical resources on what may well be futile attempts to save them. 126 Nevertheless, the argument that the government should redistribute resources to maximize benefits for the least advantaged is useful in that it emphasizes that some members of society may have greater resources and support networks with which to help them selves during emergencies than others. Thus, in the face of scarcity, officials may be justified in prioritizing the needs of those who are socially, economically, or medically vulnerable because these individuals could suffer particularly acute and long-lasting harm. As one commentator asserts, \"Social justice. . . requires action to preserve human dignity for all, particularly those who suffer from systematic disadvantage.\" 127 120 Id. at 118-23. 121 Id. at 118. 122 Id. 123 Id. at 132-33; W INSLOW , supra note 101, at 51-52. 124 RAWLS , supra note 119, at 65-70. 125 Id. at 68-70, 175. 126 Moskop & Iserson, supra note 99, at 285. 127 Lawrence O.

What Ethics Teaches Us Utilitarianism, equal chances, and the best outcome for the least well off constitute three distinct appr oaches to distributive justice. These ethical theories provide no clear, single answer to the question of how emergency planners and responders should prioritize the needs of various populations and to whom resources should be allocated in the face of scarcity. Because there are no clear answers to these complex moral questions, the optimal approach is to minimize the need for difficult ethical choices, as I argue below. The utilitarian goal of maximizing the net benefit to society may be intuitively appealing, especially in the context of disasters. 128 However, alternative conceptions of distributive justice also exist. These promote egalitarianism129 or emphasize the needs of the disadvantaged.130 Many commentators argue vigorously that considerable resources should be invested in assisting vulnerable individuals such as the poor, inst itutionalized, and disabled, because they are the least able to withstand the hardships caused by catastrophic events. 131 Even some proponents of a utilitarian approach find it unethical to consider certain vulnerabilities as factors that influence resource allocation, and thus they offer a hybrid form of utilitarianism. For example, one article categorizes the following considerations as permissible for purposes of making emergency treatment decisions when faced with scarce resources: likelihood, duration, and extent of benefit as well as urgency of need and amount of required resources. 132 128 See RAWLS , supra note 119, at 20 (describing cl assical utilitarianism as teaching that \"society is rightly orde red, and therefore just, when its major institutions are arranged so as to achieve the greatest net balance of satisfaction summed over all the individuals belonging to it\"); R obert Baker & Martin Strosberg, Triage and Equality: An Historical Reassessment of Utilitarian Analyses of Triage , 2 K ENNEDY INST. ETHICS J. 103, 106 (1992). 129 See Baker & Strosberg, supra note 128, at 105 (discussing egalitarianism); supra Part II.B. (discussing equal chances theo ry). Egalitarianism means treating all members of society equally. See Baker & Strosberg, supra note 128, at 105 . 130 See supra Part II.C. 131 See JONATHAN WOLFF & AVNER DE -SHALIT , DISADVANTAGE 3 (2007) (reporting on convergence of views that ideal policy is to \"identify the worst off and take appropriate steps so that their position can be improved\"); Gostin, supra note 127, at 3 (asserting that \"[s]ocial justic e demands more than fair di stribution of benefits and burdens in extreme health emergencies\" and that failure to adequately support disadvantaged will \"undermine[] social cohesion\"); Usch er-Pines et al., supra note 6, at 33 (emphasizing that pandemic is likely to \"exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities\" and is thus \"an urgent matter of social justice\"); supra Part II.C. 132 Pesik et al., supra note 101, at 644. 1514 University of California, Davis [Vol. 42:1491 However, the authors warn that the following factors should not be deemed relevant: \"[a]ge, ethnicity , or sex\"; \"[t]alents, abilities, disabilities, or \"[s]ocio economic status, social worth, or political position\"; \"[c]oexistent conditions that do not affect short-term prognosis\"; \"[d]rug or alcohol abuse\"; and \"[a]ntisocial or aggressive behaviors.\" 133 Accordingly, decision makers pursuing the goal of maximizing the net benefit to society would focus on short-term outcomes, prioritizing based on resources, need, and benefit considerations but not based on value judgments concerning who is deserving of care or who will live the most valuable lives in the future. A careful study of American law reveals many instances in which we reject the utilitarian approach. American society has already elected to expend disproportionate resources on assisting the disadvantaged, and thus it is evident that doing so is politically feasible. For example, a large percentage of health care spending occurs at the end of life, often out of the publicly funded Medicare program, when there is little hope of longevity or a long-term high quality of life. 134 L i k e w i s e , Medicaid135 and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (\"SCHIP\")136 provide health benefits for the impoverished at public expense, while other Americans must pay out of pocket for insurance policies or remain uninsured.137 The Americans with Disabilities Act138 requires reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, even when these impose expenditures upon private 133 Id. 134 See Micah Hartman et al., U.S. Health Spending by Age, Selected Years Through 2004 , 27 H EALTH AFF. w1, w2 (2007) (stating that per capita spending for those age 85 and older was 5.7 percent high er than spending by work ing-age individuals in 2004); Christopher Hogan et al., Medicare Beneficiaries' Costs of Care in the Last Year of Life , 20 H EALTH AFF. 188, 190 (2001) (reporting that \"spending in the last year of life accounted for 27.4% of all Medicare outlays for the elderly\"); Donald R.

Nevertheless, this Article does not attempt to resolve the challenging normative question of whether, in the face of extreme scarcity during an emergency, resources should be allocated disproportionately to the vulnerable while others are allowed to suffer greater deprivation as a result. Rather, I argue that societ y should focus significant attention on vulnerable populations during emergency planning processes, when planners have the leisure of acting without the pressures of time, chaotic conditions, and an extreme dearth of resources. 142 Many complicated ethical decisions could in fact be avoided with appropriate emergency response preparation. Response and recovery plans must include provisions to meet the needs of a wide spectrum of vulnerable groups. An essential goal of emergency planning efforts should be to minimize unanticipated and complicated resource allocation problems involving the disadvantaged and vulnerable. 143 Moreover, disaster readiness for the general population and disaster readiness for the vulnerable are mutually beneficial goals. The best outcomes for the vulnerable are most likely to be achieved with optimal preparation for those without special needs. The more prepared and well equipped the general population is to react appropriately during emergencies and the more the healthy and strong can care for themselves, the more likely it is that resources will be available for the acute needs of the disadvantaged. Advance planning and preparedness initiatives for all populations should aim to curtail the need for difficult moral choices and for sacrificing some victims for the sake of others. 139 See id. \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv); infra text accompanying note 197. 140 Individuals with Disabilities Educat ion Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400-82 (2006) (originally enacted as Educ ation of the Handicapped Act of 1970, Pub.

T HE LAW AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS The U.S. Constitution, federal law, and state statutes establish numerous obligations to protect vulnerable groups. Several of these are emergency response laws that specifically address disaster response and preparedness for the disadvantaged. Emergency relief planners and responders must recognize and be guided by these mandates. This Part focuses on a variety of general and disaster-specific federal and state provisions that establish nondiscrimination directives and affirmative duties to accommodate the needs of particular at-risk groups. A. General Legal Protecti ons for the Vulnerable Many legal provisions establish general protections for a variety of vulnerable groups. These protections apply both in ordinary times and in disasters. Below I analyze federal constitutional and statutory provisions, including the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and Titl e VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. I also analyze state constituti onal and statutory laws and tort theory, all of which generally protect the vulnerable. 1. Federal Protections Federal protections for the disadvantaged flow from both constitutional provisions and federal statutes. I analyze the content and efficacy of these safeguards below, turning first to constitutional law and then to statutory law. a. Constitutional Provisions The Equal Protection Clause and the Eighth Amendment are the principal sources of constitutional protection for the vulnerable. While plaintiffs have asserted many claims based on these Amendments, constitutional jurisprudence establishes significant obstacles to successful litigation. Despite these obstacles, constitutional mandates serve as an important guide for emergency planners and responders. (1) The Equal Protection Clause The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that no state shall \"deny to any person 2009] Preparing for Disaster 1517 within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"144 The Supreme Court has ruled that the equal protection mandate applies to both state and federal governmental entities.145 This mandate in principle prohibits group-based discrimination by the government.146 The Equal Protection Clause most clearly prohibits race-based discrimination by the government. During the 1970s and 1980s, minority communities brought several successful federal equal protection challenges against municipalities based upon inequitable distribution of public services. In Hawkins v. Town of Shaw , 147 the plaintiffs alleged that African Americans occupied nearly ninety-eight percent of homes adjacent to unpaved streets in the town; that ninety-seven percent of homes without sanitary sewer service were in African-American neighborhoods; and that all new mercury vapor street lighting fixtures were in stalled in white neighborhoods. 148 Based on these facts, the Fifth Circuit fo und that the town had violated the Equal Protection Clause by providing plaintiffs with inferior governmental services.149 Similarly, in Ammons v. Dade City, Florida ,150 the Eleventh Circuit held that the City's intentional discrimination in the provision of street paving, re surfacing, maintenance, and storm water drainage facilities to black and white communities constituted an equal protection violation. 151 These precedents demonstrate that plaintiffs can assert successful equal protection claims in cases of serious, intentional governmental discrimination. Thus, if authorities deliberately underserve or mistreat a minority community, such as African Americans, during an emergency because of race, that group could have a valid equal protection claim. Liability for violations of the Equal Protection Clause is not limited to governmental agencies. State officials can be sued in their individual capacities for violating constitutional and civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. 152 That section provides that \"[e]very person who, 144 U.S. CONST . amend. XIV, \u00a7 1; see also U.S. CONST . amend. V (stating that no person shall \"be deprived of life, liberty, or property, wi thout due process of law\"). 145 See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 498-99 (1954). 146 Daniel P. Tokaji, First Amendment Equal Protection: On Discretion, Inequality, and Participation , 101 M ICH. L. REV. 2409, 2422 (2003) (\"Race discrimination is the archetype of the group-based discriminations that the Equal Protection Clause was enacted to forbid.\"). 147 437 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir. 1971). 148 Id. at 1288. 149 Id. 150 783 F.2d 982 (11th Cir. 1986). 151 Id. at 983-84. 152 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). 1518 University of California, Davis [Vol. 42:1491 under color of any statute, ordinance, [or] . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured.\"153 The Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 1983 applies to federal officials as well.154 However, litigants asserting constitutional violations face significant challenges. First, state and federal entities and their employees often enjoy immunity protection. The Eleventh Amendment provides that private citizens cannot sue states for damages in federal court. 155 This principle extends to constitutional claims in state court156 and to agencies and other arms of the state.157 All suits for damages or retroactive relief against state governments are barred by the Amendment unless they are brought by a state or the federal government, 158 though Eleventh Amendment immunity does not extend to local government entities.159 Likewise, the doctrine of federal sovereign immunity protects the United States from being sued without its consent. 160 Furthermore, the defense of qualified immunity shields federal and state government officials who are performing discretionary functions in their official capacities from liability for civil damages unless th eir conduct violates \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" 161 Immunity and qualified immunity thus constitute significant barriers to recovery for constitutional claims. 153 Id. 154 See Bivens v. Six Unnamed Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 395 (1970) (allowing for damages to redress Fourth Amendment violations by federal officials). 155 U.S. CONST . amend. XI. The text reads as follows: \"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of th e United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\" 156 Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 712 (1999) (h olding that \"the powers delegated to Congress under Article I of the United States Constitution do not include the power to subject nonconsenting States to priv ate suits for damages in state courts\"). 157 Edelman v.

Policies or actions that have only a disparate impact on a particular group do not violate the Equal Protection Clause.162 Finally, courts do not analyze all unequal treatment cases in the same manner under constitutional standards. Governmental classifications based on race, national origin, or alienage are subject to strict scrutiny by the courts. 163 All other types of classifications receive lower levels of review. For example, courts review sex-based differential treatment under intermediate scrutiny.164 And classifications based on age and disability are subject to \"rational basis\" review \u2014 the government must show only that such classifications constitute \"rational means to serve a legitimate end.\"165 Plaintiffs asserting clai ms that will be assessed under the rational basis standard thus face particularly significant obstacles to successful litigation. Still, while litigants may have diffi culty prevailing in damages suits against governmental entities and employees, the Hawkins and Ammons cases166 demonstrate that plaintiff victories are possible. Furthermore, regardless of potent ial litigation outcomes, the Equal Protection Clause articulates a clear antidiscrimination principle that should guide governmental authorities, including those charged with emergency preparedness and response. (2) The Eighth Amendment The Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of \"cruel and unusual punishment[]\"167 and governs the treatment of incarcerated individuals.168 While the general population has no right to health care or to have other services provided by the government,169 prisoners conduct as measured by reference to clearly established law\"). 162 Washington v.

VIII. 168 Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 31 (1993); Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976). 169 v. Shallowford Cmty. Ho sp., 826 F.2d 1030, 1032 (11th Cir. 1987) (explaining that there is \"n o general right, based upon either the Constitution or 1520 University of California, Davis [Vol. 42:1491 are entitled to food, clothing, shel ter, and medical treatment because they are not free to obtain these necessities for themselves.170 These entitlements are not suspended during disasters. As the Supreme Court has explained: [W]hen the State by the affirmative exercise of its power so restrains an individual's liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself, and at the same time fails to provide for his basic human needs \u2014 e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety \u2014 it transgresses the substantive limits on state action set by the Eighth Amendment . . . . 171 The Amendment embodies \"broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency.\"172 Like those subject to equal protecti on violations, prisoners who feel they are the victims of cruel and unusual punishment may bring constitutional claims. Under the Eighth Amendment, prisoners may challenge their treatment in two ways. First, they may challenge specific conduct by prison officials, and second, they may challenge prison policies or regulations. Neither is easy to accomplish. Prisoners aggrieved by specific conduct must show that the conditions of incarceration posed substantial risks of serious harm and that prison officials demonstrated \"deliberate indifference\" to their health or safety. 173 Inmates must establish that prison officials were aware of and understood the risk at issue and disregarded it.174 A showing of \"deliberate indifference\" requires more than evidence of negligence but less than proof of acts or omis sions intended to cause harm or perpetrated with knowledge that harm would result.175 Likewise, claims based on allegedl y unconstitutional prison policies face significant hurdles. Even if policies infringe upon prisoners' constitutional rights, courts will uphold them so long as they are reasonably related to the govern ment's legitimate penological interests. 176 Despite this obstacle, inmates have prevailed in several federal statutes, to the provision of medi cal treatment and services by a state or municipality\"). 170 DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 200 (1989). 171 Id. 172 Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 579 (8th Cir. 1968). 173 Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994). 174 Id. at 837. 175 Id. at 835. 176 Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987) (involving challenges to regulation concerning inmate-to-inmate correspondence, which was upheld, and inmate marriage regulation, which was not). In order to analyze a regulation's 2009] Preparing for Disaster 1521 cases challenging prison policies. For example, in Tillery v. Owen ,177 the Third Circuit found that prison conditions violated the Eighth Amendment when prisoners were double-celled in \"an overcrowded, dilapidated and unsanitary\" facility. 178 Similarly, in French v. Owens ,179 the plaintiffs alleged that they were subjected to overcrowding and mechanical restraints; that they received inadequate health care, food, and recreation; and that the pris on had an insufficient number of safety personnel and failed to comply with fire and occupational safety regulations.180 The Seventh Circuit found that many of these conditions constituted cruel and unusual punishment that was unacceptable under the Eighth Amendment. 181 In the context of emergency preparedness, the failure to develop and execute emergency plans may constitute an Eighth Amendment violation. Concededly, ordinary negligence by prison authorities is not a constitutional violation, and most prison regulations are upheld as sufficiently linked to valid penological goals. 182 B u t i f p r i s o n authorities do not have or do not follow established emergency plans and abandon prisons en masse, leaving inmates to fend for themselves, as happened after Hurricane Katrina, an Eighth Amendment violation reasonableness, a court must consider the following four factors: (1) there must be a valid, rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental intere st put forward to justify it; (2) the court should determine whether there are alternative means of exercising the constitutional right that remain open to the inmates; (3) the court is to consider the impact that accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards, other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources; and (4) the court should assess whether there are ready alternatives to the prison regulation; the absence of such ready alternatives suggests that the regulation is reasonable while their existence may be evidence of the opposite.

Sumner, 917 F.2d 38 2, 385 (9th Cir. 1990) (quoting Safley , 482 U.S. at 89- 91) (internal quotations and citations omitted). 177 907 F.2d 418 (3d Cir. 1990). 178 Id. at 420. 179 777 F.2d 1250 (7th Cir. 1985). 180 Id. at 1251. 181 See id. at 1258 (affirming district court's judgment for plaintiffs based on overcrowding, double-celling, mechanical restraints, and inadequate medical care, kitchen services, and correction officers, and vacating and remanding lower-court judgment insofar as it addressed exercise, recreation, protective custody, and fire and occupational safety); see also McCord v. Maggio, 927 F.2d 844, 847 (5th Cir. 1991) (finding that inmate's Eight Amendment righ ts were violated when he was forced to live in sewage and filthy water). 182 See supra notes 173-76 and accompanying text. 1522 University of California, Davis [Vol. 42:1491 may exist. Similarly, if prison au thorities implement irrational policies that have no penological goals and endanger prisoners' lives during an emergency, courts may find them liable for constitutional violations.183 b. Statutory Protections Several federal statutes establish antidiscrimination mandates that apply to emergency planning and response activities. These laws, which prohibit discrimination base d on disability, race, color, and national origin, include the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, all of which are analyzed below. (1) The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act The Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") prohibits disability- based discrimination. 184 The ADA Amendments Act of 2008185 clarified the definition of \"disability\" and instructed that the term be interpreted in a broad and inclusive manner.186 The Rehabilitation Act of 1973187 provides further protections to the disabled. Together, these acts forbid public and private entities from discriminating against those with disabilities. More over, these acts reflect a legislative determination that society should not only eschew discrimination but also furnish accommodations for the needs of the disabled. The ADA features separate titles that address discrimination by governmental entities and private businesses. Title II of the ADA governs the conduct of public services. 188 Qualified individuals with disabilities189 may not be denied the benefits of programs, activities, and services, such as public transportation, provided by public 183 See Robbins, supra note 73, at 20-40 (arguing that Eighth Amendm ent provides prisoners with plausible mechanism by which to challenge mistreatment such as that suffered during and after Hurricane Katrina). 184 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-213 (2000). 185 Pub.

This Title addresses th e treatment of individuals with disabilities by \"public accommodatio ns\" and prohibits disability-based discrimination in the provision of goods, services, and other benefits.193 As defined in the ADA, \"public accommodation\" is a term of art referring to any private entity whose operations affect commerce.194 This broad definition includes within its sweep much of the health care industry - pharmacies, insurance companies, health care providers, hospitals, and other service providers.195 This Title also covers public transportation services prov ided by private entities.196 Title III requires covered entities to modify their policies, procedures, architecture, and communication mechanisms to accommodate individuals with disabilities, unless doing so is not readily achievable. 197 T h e s e modifications, for example, entail installing ramps for wheelchairs, furnishing TTY phone service for the hearing impaired, or changing attendance or break policies. Like Title II, Title III provides a private cause of action for those whose rights are violated. 198 The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 preceded the ADA by many years, and it set an important, albeit somewhat narrow, precedent for protection of individuals with disa bilities. Section 504 of the Act199 190 Id. \u00a7 12132. A \"public entity\" is defined as (1) a state or local government; (2) an instrumentality of a state or local government; or (3) the National Railroad Passenger Corporation and any other commuter authority. Id. \u00a7 12131. Damages have been allowed against states in Title II cases. In Tennessee v. Lane , 541 U.S. 509, 533-34 (2004), the Supreme Cour t held that private citi zens may sue a state under Title II of the ADA to enforce their right of access to a courthouse and that Eleventh Amendment immunity does not bar such an action. 191 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.150(a) (2008). 192 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182 (2000). \u00a7 12181(7)(F). (2006). 1524 University of California, Davis [Vol. 42:1491 protects individuals with disabilities, though it covers different parties from those to which the ADA applies. The law establishes that qualified individuals with disabilities200 may not, because of their disabilities, be excluded from, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination by programs and activities that receive federal financial support and those conducted by an executive agency of the United States or the United States Postal Service.201 These laws establish strong antidiscrimination and accommodation mandates for those with disabilities. However, Congress has qualified these protections in two significant ways. First, under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, covered entities need not accommodate individuals with disabilities if doing so would constitute an undue hardship. 202 Second, Title III of the ADA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act establish that covered entities need not allow individuals who pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others to benefit from their goods or services.203 These qualifications constitute litigation barriers for some plaintiffs. Establishing violations of these la ws by emergency responders will be particularly challenging. Plaintiffs will need to prove that the alleged wrong was due specifically to their disabilities rather than to the chaos of a disaster and that the defendant could have accommodated their needs without undue hardship. 204 Proving undue hardship during a disaster will likely be much easier for defendants than establishing this defense during ordinary times because a disaster will severely strain human and financ ial resources. In addition, if treating a patient with HIV or tuberculosis under suboptimal emergency conditions would expose the provider or other patients to a significant risk of infection, doctors may be able to prove that a direct 200 Federal regulations defi ne a qualified person under section 504 as \"a handicapped person who meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of . . . v. King, 82 F.3d 1059, 1060 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (stating that Office of Personnel Management was subject to section 504 because it was executive agency of United States). 202 42 U.S.C. \"direct threat\" as \"a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures or by the prov ision of auxiliary aids or services\"); see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a) (adopting definition of individual with disability provided in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20) (2006), which includes disc ussion of direct defense). 2009] Preparing for Disaster 1525 threat existed.205 Furthermore, precedent establishes that patients will not be successful in suing health care providers for ADA or Rehabilitation Act violations relating to good-faith medical treatment decisions.206 In addition, policies concerning the allocation of medical resources that have a disparate impact on in dividuals with disabilities may not be actionable. The Supreme Court rejected a disparate-impact challenge in Alexander v. Choate ,207 which involved Tennessee's reduction of the number of inpatient hospital days for which Medicaid would pay.208 Evaluating the restriction under the Rehabilitation Act, the Court upheld the State's fourteen-day limitation even though individuals with disabilities often have more extensive medical needs than others. 209 Since then, few disparate impact claims brought under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act have succeeded.210 In spite of these obstacles, plaintiffs might be able to assert successful disability discrimination claims in some circumstances. First, they may succeed in cases of egregious misconduct or conduct based on stereotypes and groundless assumptions about the disabled. 211 For example, if responders deem individuals with disabilities to be of low priority for triaging purposes simply because they have disabilities, they may violate disability rights statutes. 212 Second, aggrieved individuals might be successful in suits that allege deficient emergency response preparation. If emergency readiness 205 See sources cited supra note 203. 206 Burger v.

Planners operating in the absence of the chaotic circumstances of an actual emergency could find it difficult to establish undue burden as a rationale for their failure to prepare for the needs of individuals with disabilities. However, because of Eleventh Amendment immunity, federal sovereign immunity, and qualified immunity, 213 plaintiffs may not be able to obtain monetary relief from governmental actors involved in emergency preparedness.214 It is important to emphasize that the ADA and Rehabilitation Act establish a dual mandate of nondiscrimination and accommodation.215 These laws require covered entities not only to eschew discrimination, but also to take affirmative steps to accommodate the needs of individuals with disabilities. This dual commitment is particularly important in the context of emergencies, when individuals with physical and mental impairments have many special needs. 216 (2) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Whereas the ADA and Rehabilitation Acts protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits racial discrimination, broadly defined. The law prohibits programs or activities receiving federal funds from engaging 213 See supra notes 155-61 and accompanying text. 214 See United States v.

However, it is unclear whether damages coul d be obtained in Title II cases that do not allege a violation of fundamental rights. See Michael Waterstone, A New Vision of Public Enforcement , 92 M INN. L. REV. 434, 465 (2007). 215 See supra notes 184-201 and accompanying text. 216 Several scholars have argued that the ADA's current reasonable accommodation mandate is insufficient to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities and that further assistance or alternative models mu st be used to serve the needs of this population. See generally Samuel Bagenstos, The Future of Disability Law , 114 Y ALE L.J. 1 (2004) (arguing for move to social welfare model to address needs of individuals with disabilities, including government assistance such as public funding and public health insurance); Satz, supra note 35 (arguing for blending of civil rights and social welfare approaches to disability rights); Michael Ashley Stein, Disability Human Rights , 95 C AL.

Sandoval ,221 the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs do not have a private cause of action to litigate disparate-impact cases under Title VI. 222 However, aggrieved individuals retain a private cause of action to challenge intentional violations of the statute.223 Because it is very difficult to prove discriminatory intent, plaintiffs have rarely prevailed in disparat e treatment cases under the statute.224 Nevertheless, aggrieved individual s who believe that federally and state-funded programs deliberately denied disaster-related services to them because of their race, color, or national origin may seek relief under Title VI.

State Protections Like the federal government, the states have enacted legal safeguards to protect the rights of the disadvantaged. Many provisions, including state equal protection clauses, disability laws, and other antidiscrimination mandates, parallel federal laws. In addition, under state common law, aggrieved individuals can sue for recovery based on tort theory. This subpart examines the protections to which vulnerable populations are entitled under state law. a. Constitutional and Statutory Provisions Many state constitutions establish equality mandates. 225 Fifteen states have equal protection provisions that are similar to the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.226 O t h e r s t a t e s have more specific constitutional provisions, such as ones that prohibit discrimination based on se x or against individuals exercising their civil rights. 227 All fifty states have statutes that address disability rights, though they vary in scope and content. In general, these state laws prohibit discrimination based on disability and require that individuals with disabilities enjoy access to goods and services and receive needed accommodations.228 225 See Jeffrey M.

Furrow, The Problem of the Sports Doctor: Serving Two (Or Is It Three or Four?) Masters , 50 ST. LOUIS U. L.J. 165, 182 (2005) (\"[S]tandard of care is defined by referen ce to a physician using the knowledge, skill, and care ordinarily possessed and employed by members of the profession in good standing, good medical practice within the area of specialty practice, and reasonable, customary, accepted care under the circumstances.\"). 2009] Preparing for Disaster 1531 Because the standard of care varies based on the particular circumstances at issue, treatment that is adequate for healthy adults may be negligent when provided to vulnerable people with special needs, such as children, elderly persons, or disabled individuals.233 Thus, emergency response personnel and planners should be aware that the treatment expected under the standard of care for vulnerable populations may be different from what is appropriate for others. Consequently, plaintiffs with special needs may find it easier to prove negligence or gross negligence 234 because response protocols that are acceptable for the general population could be egregiously inadequate for vulnerable individuals. 235 As is the case under statutory law, however, many parties, such as governmental actors and volunteers, will enjoy various degrees of immunity for tort actions associated with discretionary good faith emergency response activities. 236 Immunity, however, generally is not granted for gross negligence and willful misconduct.237 Furthermore, officials may be exposed to liab ility if they are not performing discretionary functions, for example, when they fail to follow clear instructions in detailed emergency plans that do not require significant judgment calls on the part of implementers. 238 The issue of liability and immunity in public health emergencies is discussed at length in my prior work and will not be repeated here.239 B. Emergency Statutes Addressing the Needs of Vulnerable Populations The constitutional, statutory, and common law protections discussed above240 are general mandates that should not be suspended during emergencies. However, because a number of legislatures have recognized that the disadvantaged will have acute needs during and after disasters, some emergency laws include provisions specifically addressing the treatment of vulnerable populations. This subpart 233 See supra Part I (discussing needs of va rious vulnerable populations). 234 See supra note 66 (defining gross negligence). 235 See supra Part I.D (discussing special needs of children). 236 Sharona Hoffman, Responders' Responsibility: Liability and Immunity in Public Health Emergencies , 96 G EO.

Federal Law and Executive Action The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act was passed by Congress in December of 2006 in reaction to the failures of the Hurricane Katrina response efforts. 241 The law added a provision entitled \"At-risk individuals\" to the Public Health Service Act.242 I t considers the \"public health and medical needs of at-risk individuals\" 243 to be a national goal. The Act defines \"at-risk individuals\" as \"children, pregnant women, senior citizens and other individuals who have special needs in the event of a public health emergency, as determined by the Secretary of Health.\" 244 The Act also allows for, but does not require, the appointment of a Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") \"Director of At-Risk Individuals\" for emergency preparedness purposes.245 Beyond these general directives, the statute provides little guidance as to how to achieve its preparedness goal.246 241 Pandemic and All-Hazards Prepared ness Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-417, 120 Stat. 2831 (codified in scattered sections of 42 U.S. C.); James G. Hodge et al., The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act: Improving Public Health Emergency Response (2006). 245 Id. \u00a7 300hh-16. 246 The provision instructs that the Secretar y and a possible appointee, the Director of At-Risk Individuals, shall: (2) assist other Federal agencies resp onsible for planning for, responding to, and recovering from public health emergencies in addressing the needs of at-risk individuals; (3) provide guidance to and ensure that recipients of State and local public health grants include preparedness an d response strategies and capabilities that take into account the medical and public health needs of at-risk individuals in the event of a public heal th emergency, as described in section 247d-3a(b)(2)(A)(iii) of this title; (4) ensure that the contents of the strategic national stockpile take into account at-risk populations as described in section 300hh-10(b)(3)(B) of this title; (5) oversee the progress of the Advisory Committee on At-Risk Individuals and Public Health Emergencies estab lished under section 247d-6(b)(2) of this title and make reco mmendations with a focus on opportunities for action based on the work of the Committee; 2009] Preparing for Disaster 1533 An older law, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (\"Stafford Act\"), en acted in 1988, establishes a broad nondiscrimination mandate to protect vulnerable populations.247 I t enables the President to declare an emergency or major disaster.248 A federal emergency may be declared at the request of a governor249 or, in some circumstances, at the President's own initiative.250 Section 308 of the Stafford Act251 empowers the President to issue regulations to govern the provision of federal assi stance at the location of major disasters and emergencies. These regulations, however, must ensure that authorities accomplish relief ac tivities \"without discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, nationality, sex, age, disability, English proficiency, or economic status.\"252 Federal governmental entities and other organizations supplying or receiving disaster assistance must comply with the regulations that the President promulgates. 253 Section 308, however, does not establish a private cause of action for violations, and no court thus far has found that an implied cause of action exists. 254 Nevertheless, its nondiscrimination mandate is expansive, extending to English proficiency and economic status, classifications that are not covered by other federal laws and not traditionally deemed to be protected within the American legal system. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Congress passed the Post- Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which created the position of Disability Coordinator in FEMA to aid in disaster (6) oversee curriculum development for the public health and medical response training program on medical management of casualties, as it concerns at-risk individuals as described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of section 247d-16(a)(2) of this title; [and] (7) disseminate novel and best practices of outreach to and care of at-risk individuals before, during, and following public health emergencies.

It does not, however, cover any at-risk groups other than the disabled. The Act does not mandate any similar planning efforts for minorities, children, the impoverished, and others. Individuals with disabilities are also the subject of an executive order designed to provide them with additional protection. On July 22, 2004, President Bush issued Executive Order 13,347, entitled \"Individuals with Disabilities in Emergency Preparedness,\" which promotes consideration of the safety and security of the disabled during emergencies 257 and establishes the Interagency Coordinating Council on Emergency Preparedness and Individuals with Disabilities in the Department of Homeland Security.258 T h e D e p a r t m e n t o f Homeland Security also expressed concern about individuals with disabilities in 2006 and issued a report finding that they were inadequately integrated into emergency readiness plans.259 255 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 321b(a) (2006); Press Rel ease, FEMA, Cindy Daniel Named FEMA's Disability Coordinator (June 21, 2007) (http 13,347, 69 (July 22, 2004), available at http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr _2005/janqtr/pdf/3CFR13347.pdf. 258 Id.; see INTERAGENCY COORDINATING COUNCIL ON EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES , U.S. DEP'T OF HOMELAND SEC., INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES IN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS EXECUTIVE ORDER 13347: PROGRESS REPORT JULY 2005 - SEPTEMBER 2006, at 6, available at http://www.disabilityp reparedness.gov/ pdf/icc_0506_progress.pdf (last visited Apr. 10, 2009) (reporting on preparedness progress achieved throug h Council's efforts). 259 U.S. DEP'T OF HOMELAND SEC., NATIONWIDE PLAN REVIEW PHASE 2 REPORT 41, 46-47 (2006), available at http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/P rep_NationwidePlanReview.pdf. 2009] Preparing for Disaster 1535 The Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") has similarly stepped in to provide government agencies with guidance as to emergency preparedness for the disabled. In the same year that President Bush signed his executive order, the DOJ issued guidance for local governments entitled \"Making Co mmunity Emergency Preparedness and Response Programs Accessible to People with Disabilities.\" 260 That document urged governmental entities to include individuals with disabilities in planning efforts. 261 It also suggested the establishment of a voluntary and adequately confidential registry of people with disabilities so that local officials can provide individual assistance to those in need. 262 In particular, it emphasized planning requirements in the following areas that impact people with disabilities: (1) methods of communication must include both visual messages and audio announcements so that they are usable by people with visual and hearing impairments; (2) evacuation plans should be designed to accommodate individuals with mobility, vision, hearing, cognitive, and mental health impairments; (3) planners should identify all accessible modes of transportation, such as lift-equipped buses, that could be available during an emergency; (4) shelters must be fully accessible, staffed with individuals who are educated about the special needs of individuals with di sabilities (e.g., m obility assistance, help dressing, and communication), equipped with refrigeration, back-up power, and other necessities for people who need medication or assistive devices (e.g., wheel ch airs), and willing to house service animals even if pets are generally disallowed; and (5) facilities and trailers that will temporarily house individuals with disabilities must be accessible and appropriately equipped. 263 2.

For a 1536 University of California, Davis [Vol. 42:1491 comprehensive review of state emergency statutes reveals that some contain provisions focusing on vulnerable populations, though these statutes vary widely in scope and content. However, emergency statutes in over half the states contain no reference to vulnerable populations. 265 A few states have adopted antidiscrimination provisions that apply specifically to disaster relief activities.266 These protect vulnerable populations by prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, ancestry, and economic status, and they prohibit discrimination by individuals or entities furnishing disaster relief services. 267 Some states have taken steps to ensure that the disabled are specifically considered in the course of emergency planning efforts. A number of state provisions instruct in relatively general terms that planning initiatives should be undertaken. 268 Several states provide for the appointment of state officials with responsibility for individuals with disabilities.269 Three states have established registries of disabled people.270 Individuals are encouraged to register prior to disasters so that they can more easily receive assistance.271 Other states specifically address the need for accessible shelters,272 telecommunication,273 list of state laws and their definitions of \"emergency\" or \"disaster,\" see id. at 79-89 app. B. 265 See infra notes 266-79 and accompanying text (describing exis ting statutory provisions). 266 CONN.

This Part analyzes the shortcomin g of American law insofar as it addresses the needs of vulnerable populations in disasters. It then develops recommendations to address the current gaps and shortcomings of the law. It is only with educated, sensitive, and responsible planning that we can avoid repeating the many failures that the disadvantaged have suffered in past disasters. A. Where Existing Law Falls Short While numerous legal provisions establish equality and nondiscrimination mandates as well as affirmative duties towards vulnerable populations, these laws are insufficient to protect the needs of the vulnerable during disasters. In principle, these mandates and duties apply both in ordinary times and during emergencies. 281 A s discussed in Part III, these includ e the Equal Protection Clause, the Eighth Amendment, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and state constitutional equal protection provisions, disability laws, and civil rights statutes. 282 With all these laws in place, it might be tempting to argue that vulnerable populations already have adequate legal protections. Unfortunately, the difficulty litigants have in vindicating their rights under current law 283 necessitates more rigorous protection. Relying on litigation as the primary safeguard for the rights of the disadvantaged raises at least four significant concerns. First, those who die or are permanently disabled as a result of emergency responders' acts or omissions can ne ver be made whole, even if they are able to prove liability. Seco nd, various sources of immunity protect governmental actors, vol unteers, and others from liability related to disaster response activities.284 Third, juries might believe that under chaotic, exigent circumstances, responders performed as well as possible, that response shortcomings must be forgiven, and that inequities were inevitable. Fourth, the disadvantaged might not be able to afford to litigate claims to vindicate their rights. 280 See infra Part IV.B (discussing recommendations offered by preparedness experts). 281 See supra Part III.A. 282 See supra Part III.A. 283 See supra Part III. 284 See Hoffman, supra note 236, at 1937-54; supra notes 155-61 and accompanying text. 2009] Preparing for Disaster 1539 Consequently, litigation is unlikely to provide adequate relief to aggrieved parties in the aftermath of a disaster. In light of these limitations, some legislatures have recognized that appropriate planning is of critical importance to the disadvantaged. These legislatures realize that prospectively preventing harm to the vulnerable is vastly superior to relying on a retroactive remedial system. As a result, a limited number of relevant federal and state preparedness provisions have been enacted. 285 Unfortunately, they fall far short of providing a comprehensive protection scheme. The federal and state laws constitute a patchwork of legislation that leaves many gaps and unanswered questions. For example, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (\" PAHPA\") allows for the optional appointment of a \"Director of At-Risk Individuals\" in the Department of Health and Human Services but does not require this appointment.286 It also provides no guidance as to how this official is to achieve preparedness goals.287 The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 mandates that FEMA must have a Disability Coordinator but does not address preparedness for any other vulnerable population.288 Moreover, state protections vary wide ly. While some states require a limited number of emergency plan ning initiatives for vulnerable populations,289 other states ignore the topic of emergency preparedness for the disadvantaged altogether.290 No state provides a comprehensive preparedness approach. Existing laws do not consistently designate officials who will be responsible for emergency preparedness for the disadvantaged and who will be publicly accountable in case of failures. Nor do the statutes provide extensive, detailed guidance as to what steps should be taken to address the needs of vulnerable populations in disasters. Without mechanisms to ensure accountability and without specific requirements, appropriate preparedness is unlikely to be accomplished. In the absence of strong statutory mandates, vulnerable populations, who often have weak political voices, 291 may not represent a priority for emergency planners. Consequently, further legislative intervention is needed. 285 See supra Part III.B. 286 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300hh-16 See supra Part Part III.B.2. 291 Law & Ensminger, supra note 25, at 81. 1540 University of California, Davis [Vol. 42:1491 B. Specific Recommendations A critically important mechanism for the promotion of the interests of disadvantaged communities is federal and state emergency response legislation. Both federal and state laws addressing emergency preparedness for vulnerable populations should be revised and strengthened to maximize disaster readiness. The suggested legal interventions are designed to bolster accountability and ensure that specific tasks are undertaken to promote the interests of the disadvantaged during disasters. 1. Enhancing Accountability Federal and state statutes should re quire the designation of officials with specific responsibility for vulnerable groups in emergencies. Government officials who are required by law to engage in various planning activities are likely to be motivated to achieve preparedness goals because they will be judged based on their performance. Administrations that fail in their planning and response efforts may suffer serious political consequences, and individual officials may lose their jobs, as was the case after Hurricane Katrina. 292 Federal law should thus provid e for greater accountability. Congress should amend PAHPA to require the appointment of a Director of At-Risk Individuals rather than leaving such an appointment to the discretion of the Health and Human Services Secretary. 293 Following the example of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, PAHPA or associated federal regulations should also develop more detailed requirements as to the tasks that the Director must accomplish. 294 Under PAHPA, the Secretary was obligated to submit a report to Congress concerning preparedness progress by December 19, 2007. 295 Such reports should be required on an annual basis an d should be publicly available. PAHPA, however, is not the only federal law that must be amended in order to provide comprehensive protection to vulnerable 292 Christine Hauser, Three Days After Losing Katrina Duties, FEMA Chief Resigns Post, N.Y.

The Act governs only one type of disaster \u2014 public health emergencies.296 It is important that federal legislation require preparedness planning for a wide range of federally declared disasters.297 Congress should therefore amend the more broadly applicable Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act as well.298 The statutorily established position of FEMA Disability Coordinator299 should be expanded to encompass coordination of emergency preparedness for all vulnerable populations and not solely for individuals with disabilities. 300 The statute should include a detailed list of tasks that addresses not only the needs of individuals with disabilities, 301 but also those of other vulnerable populations,302 and should require publicly available annual progress reports. The state emergency statutes should also require the appointment of officials with specific responsibility for at-risk groups, because not all emergencies will be declared at the federal level.303 Furthermore, the activities of state and local respon ders may reach more individuals than the assistance of federal author ities. Designated state officials with explicit responsibility for vulnerable populations will be accountable if they fail to perform their assigned duties and could suffer job loss or political backlash. However, in order to be effective, offices in charge of planning for at-risk populations would need to be well funded and staffed, and thus, legislation must provide for adequate financial appropriations. 2. Detailed Planning Guidance The federal and state emergency laws that address disaster readiness for vulnerable populations should provide detailed requirements to guide the work of the designated governmental authorities, whom I will call vulnerable populations coordinators (\"VPCs\").

For recommendations concerning other vulnerable groups, legislators can turn to existing state emergency laws306 and proposals formulated by experts in the field. General guidance can be drawn from the report of a panel of twenty- four experts from eleven countries who met in Bellagio, Italy, in July 2006. 307 They were tasked with formulating recommendations to mitigate and prevent unjust outcomes for the world's disadvantaged in the event of a pandemic influenza outbreak.308 The experts, who became known as the \"Bellagio Group,\" created a \"Checklist for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plans\" consisting of three action items for emergency planners: (1) identify traditionally disadvantaged populations and those likely to be disproportionately harmed by a pandemic; (2) involve these groups in planning initiatives; and (3) identify and address the needs of vulnerable populations likely to arise from a pandemic. 309 Many advocates and scholars have applied similar criteria to formulate more detailed recommendations for vulnerable groups. For example, experts have stressed the importance of obtaining input directly from affected communities. 310 Federal and state officials should be statutorily required to consult with representatives of the various vulnerable populations because these individuals may be in the best position to assess and articulate their needs. 311 Representatives could be chosen from among the leadership of major advocacy organizations, such as th e National Council on Disability and the AARP. 304 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 321b(b) (2006). 305 See supra 260-63 text. 306 See supra Part III.B.2. 307 Uscher-Pines et al., supra note 6, at 33. 308 Id. 309 Id. 310 Andrulis et al., supra note 1, at 1274 (reporting that some state and local government agencies have also involved minority groups in discussions concerning how best to communicate with and serve particular communities in emergencies); Uscher-Pines et al., supra note 6, at 33. 311 See 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 321b(b)(3) (2006) (requiri ng Disability Coordinator to consult \"with organizations that represent the interests and rights of individuals with disabilities about the needs of individuals with disabilities in emergency planning requirements and relief efforts\"). In the case of children, undocumented persons, and prisoners, it will most likely be necessary to rely upon advocates who represent their interests rather than members of these populations themselves. 2009] Preparing for Disaster 1543 Statutes should also obligate VPCs to ensure that modes of communication, educational materials, shelters, transportation, medical supplies, and other resources are accessible to disabled, elderly, or impoverished individuals, children, those who are not proficient in English, and others who are disadvantaged. 312 M o r e specifically, with respect to child ren, the statutes should list the following goals, recommended by the Institute of Medicine: (1) establish protocols to minimize separations between parents and children and expedite reunions in cas e of unavoidable separations; (2) improve pediatric expertise among health care providers involved in emergency response activities; (3) develop pediatric surge capacities; (4) supply social, medical, and ment al health services that are appropriate for children; and (5) at least every two years conduct disaster drills that include a hypo thetical pediatric mass casualty event. 313 In addition, to protect elderly and disabled individuals with limited mobility, the statutes shou ld require support for homebound individuals and the provision of home health care services, to the extent possible.314 VPCs should also be required to safeguard the welfare of ethnic minorities and those with language ba rriers through specific measures. These include the following steps: (1) promoting culturally sensitive, accurate, and easily understood translation of written and verbal communication; (2) increasing use of technology, such as audio and video tools for those with poor reading comprehension; (3) conducting tabletop training exercises geared towards minority communities that address issues such as distrust of governmental authorities, 315 availability of translators, and other culturally relevant issues; and (4) creating centralized information resources that enable agencies and organizations serving minorities to access appropriate materials and experts. 316 312 Id. \u00a7 321b(b) (requiring FEMA Disability Coordinator to promote accessibility of communication mechanisms, transportation, and temporary housing). 313 INST.

See Sharona Hoffman, \"Racially-Tailored\" Medicine Unraveled , 55 A M. U. L. REV. 395, 426-27 (2005). Illegal aliens may distrust offers of government assistance in disasters because they fear being prosecuted for immigration violations.

The VPCs should oversee efforts to develop plans for the efficient and safe evacuation of prisons and jails,317 ensuring that prison authorities conduct disaster drills, coordinate across departmental lines, and have design ated facilities that can receive evacuees who are inmates.318 Emergency statutes should also a ddress the creation of voluntary registries to store information abou t those who are most likely to be isolated and to lack mobility and communication modes during an emergency. These include individuals with disabilities,319 elderly persons, and those with English language barriers.320 Registries would allow responders to locate those with special needs and would facilitate efforts to reach them for purposes of evacuat ion or delivery of information and supplies. Both local authorities and advocacy organizations should educate at-risk communities abou t the registries and encourage individuals to provide the necessary information. Although data would be accessible to authorized individuals during emergencies, registry operators would need to implement safe guards so that confidentiality is maintained. Vulnerable people are unlik ely to register if they believe that their identities, medical conditions, and contact information might be sold to marketers or disclosed to other third parties. Widespread use of electronic health record systems would significantly enhance the efficacy of registries, enabling optimal treatment of victims once they are located.321 These systems would prevent medical records from being lost, allow responders to locate critical information through electronic searches, alert clinicians to patients' medical histories, allergie s, or drug lists, and facilitate treatment in many other ways. 322 317 See AM.

The relevant statutory provisions should requir e that in such cases, contracts between the state and private parties obligate the provider of services to plan for and be prepared to address the needs of vulnerable populations.323 Failure to plan appropriately would constitute breach of contract that would be actionable by the state government. Moreover, all state emergency response laws should contain explicit nondiscrimination mandates.324 Following the Stafford Act's precedent,325 all states should include provisions that prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, ancestry, economic status, or disability326 in the provision of state- sponsored disaster assistance. Responders and recipients of aid who are found to violate these provisions wo uld be deemed to have breached their disaster relief contracts with the state or forfeit state funding.327 These recommendations do not demand the creation of new private causes of action for aggrieved individuals beyond those that already exist.328 As argued in previous work, liability for response activities can have the adverse effect of discouraging participation in emergency operations329 and therefore must be approached with great caution by legislators. Even without the threat of new causes of action, the proposed statutory provisions should galvanize politically accountable emergency planners and focus their attention on the fate of the disadvantaged. The recommended requirements would follow a long-established tradition in American law and policy of both prohibiting discrimination against the vulnerable and devoting significant and often disproportionate resources to promoting the welfare of the 323 See ALA. CODE \u00a7 31-9B-3 (LexisNexis Supp. 2007) (requiring that state agencies include emergency planning requirements in contracts for care of disabled). 324 See supra notes 266-67 and accompanying text (discussing states that already have such provisions). 325 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5151(a) (2000). 326 These laws could incorporate by refere nce existing state laws that prohibit discrimination based on various classifications and emphasize that the mandates apply even during emergencies. For example, all states have laws that prohibit disability- based discrimination. See supra note 228. 327 See \u00a7 5151 (deeming with Stafford to be \"a condition of participat ion in the distribution of assistance or supplies under this chapter or of receiving assistance\"). 328 See supra Part III. 329 Hoffman, supra note 236, at 1917, 1955-56. 1546 University of California, Davis [Vol. 42:1491 disadvantaged. These commitments are manifested in constitutional provisions, including the Equal Protection Clause and the Eighth Amendment, disability laws such as the ADA and IDEA, public programs such as Medicaid and SCHIP,330 and a limited number of existing federal and state emergency laws.331 The suggested approach, consequently, is not unprecedented and should be embraced by the government and American public. CONCLUSION It is clear that during emergencies vulnerable populations will have special needs and require particular attention.332 H o w e v e r , d e s p i t e significant investment of resources in emergency preparedness at the federal and state levels, 333 progress for special needs groups remains slow, and many have identified seve re planning and readiness gaps in this area.334 For these populations, emergency response failures can have catastrophic consequences, including loss of the ability to work or live independently, permanent injury, and death.335 As the Hurricane Katrina experience made clear, preparedness fiascos will result in humiliation and a loss of public faith in the government as well. 336 In the context of emergencies, vulnerable populations include a large spectrum of groups: individuals with physical and mental impairments, elderly persons, those with language barriers, children, pregnant women, the impoverished, certain ethnic minorities, undocumented persons, and prisoners. 337 Some segment of each of these populations is likely to require acute attention. While individuals with disabilities have drawn some attention in preparedness circles,338 other vulnerable populations have been all but ignored.339 330 See supra notes 134-41; Part III. 331 See supra Part III.B. 332 See supra Part I. 333 See supra notes 1-2 and accompanying text. 334 CTRS.

Without appropriate planning, response efforts are unlikely to be adequate for at-risk communities. A robust legal framework already requires that the welfare of vulnerable groups be safeguarded. These are federal and state disability rights laws, the Equal Protection Clause, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and equivalent state laws, the Eighth Amendment, PAHPA, the Stafford Act, and various state laws. 340 Emergency planners and responders operating at the pre-event, event, and recovery phases should bear in mind the mandates and spirit of these legal provisions. These laws establish a commitment to eschew discrimination against vulnerable populations and require that affirmative steps be taken to safeguard the welfare of the disadvantaged. In addition, several distributive justice theories justify allocation of scarce resources to members of vulnerable populations even if they require more intensiv e care or disproportionately large resource investments when compared to others. 341 It is also important to emphasize that disaster readine ss for vulnerable populations goes hand in hand with preparedness fo r the general population. If those without special needs are well equipped to react appropriately and care for themselves during emergencies, the vulnerable are more likely to enjoy good outcomes because more resources will be available to serve those who require extra assistance. Nevertheless, a careful critique reveals that existing mandates are insufficient to protect the welfare of at-risk groups during disasters. Consequently, this Article has formul ated detailed recommendations for revision and improvement of federal and state emergency laws so that they more effectively promote the in terests of those in greatest need. The recommendations and guidelines reviewed in this Article demonstrate that much can be done to anticipate and address the needs of the vulnerable during catastrophic events. Adequate planning will go far to minimize the extent to which these groups suffer disproportionately and experience devastating outcomes. Responsible emergency preparedness and response efforts are critical to preventing disasters from ending or ravaging the lives of society's disadvantaged members. preparedness plans address need s of disadvantaged groups). 340 See supra Part III. 341 See supra Part II.
