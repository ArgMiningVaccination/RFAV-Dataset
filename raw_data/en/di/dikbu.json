This holistic approach allows you to actively participate in managing your health through natural medicine while encouraging the self-healing process. WHAT IS NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE? The foundation of the naturopathic medicine is to identify and treat the root of the issue, thus treating the body as a whole. Rather than just suppressing symptoms, naturopathic doctors work to identify underlying causes of illness, and develop personalized treatment plans to address them. This holistic approach includes evaluating diet and lifestyle counseling, recommendations on nutritional or botanical supplements, homeopathy, nutritional supplementation, recommendations towards natural healing modalities such as acupuncture, and recommendations on lab tests or referrals to specialists when applicable. Naturopathic doctors are educated and trained in accredited naturopathic medical colleges. They diagnose, prevent and treat acute and chronic illness, restore and establish optimal health by supporting the body's inherent ability to heal. NDs use diagnostic tools common in conventional medicine, such as detailed health, disease, and prescription drug histories, physical exams, and targeted laboratory testing and imaging. NDs also consider detailed diet history, lifestyle habits and choices, exercise history, and social/emotional factors to assess patients' needs. IS NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE RIGHT FOR ME?
