Applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review. Purpose This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages studies that develop and test the effectiveness of strategies for implementation and sustainable delivery of evidence-based mental health interventions and services to improve clinical and functional outcomes for underserved populations in low-resourced settings in the United States. Studies should identify and use innovative approaches to remediate barriers to provision, receipt, and/or benefit from evidence-based practices (EBPs) and generate new information about factors integral to achieving equity in mental health outcomes for underserved populations. Research generating new information about factors causing/reducing disparities is strongly encouraged, including due consideration for the needs of individuals across the life span. Background Evidence-based practices (EBPs) that encompass mental health treatment and preventive interventions and services are effective in improving clinical and functional outcomes for a wide variety of people. Ample research suggests, however, that EBPs are often not delivered in low-resource settings and in settings where clients are predominantly from traditionally underserved populations. These populations are also more likely to have worse mental health outcomes, and more inpatient hospitalizations and emergency room use for psychiatric crises. While the prevalence of some mental disorders may be lower among racial and ethnic minorities, the course of illness is often more severe, persistent, and disabling. Recent research also suggests that disparities in receipt of mental health treatment and services may be increasing. Based on these findings, this FOA solicits research intended to improve access to evidence-based mental health care in low-resource areas and for underserved populations as a strategy for achieving greater equity in mental health and related functional outcomes and reducing disparities. Research Objectives This initiative is focused on developing and testing the effectiveness of strategies to deliver evidence-based mental health services, treatment interventions, and/or preventive interventions (EBPs) in low-resource mental health specialty and non-specialty settings within the United States, where EBPs are not currently delivered or delivered with fidelity, such that there are disparities in mental health and related functional outcomes (e.g., employment, educational attainment, stable housing retention and integration in the community, treatment of comorbid substance use disorders) for the population(s) served. Of interest are settings where a significant number of children, youth, adults, or older adults with or at risk for mental illnesses can be found and evidence-based mental health treatments or services are not currently delivered. Studies should identify and use innovative approaches to remediate barriers to provision, receipt, or benefit from EBPs and generate new information about factors integral to achieving greater equity in mental health and related functional outcomes for underserved populations. Research generating new information about factors causing/reducing disparities is strongly encouraged. The goal of this initiative is to develop scalable implementation strategies that achieve delivery of EBPs with high fidelity in these settings and significantly improve clinical and functional outcomes toward greater equity with outcomes documented in non-disparity populations. For the purposes of this FOA, NIMH uses the following definitions: Strategies for achieving equity via implementation of EBPs might include those that focus on: access, quality/fidelity of care delivery, patient/family engagement, care management and coordination, or other innovative strategies as are empirically or theoretically justified. Implementation strategies might address EBP delivery barriers at one or more of the following: provider-, clinic-, organizational-, within- or cross-systems levels. Studies submitted to this FOA should be structured to elucidate whether and how the implementation strategy achieves delivery of the EBP with fidelity, and measurement of whether receipt of EBP leads to improved mental health and related functional outcomes for the intended population(s). Accordingly, studies should be designed to explicitly assess and investigate whether the strategy being tested leads to changes in the targeted consumer- or provider-behaviors, or organizational-/system-level factors that are intervened upon proximally in order to achieve implementation of EBPs, and in turn, ultimately improve clinical and functional outcomes. The goal is to inform how best to deliver and sustain EBPs in low-resourced settings and determine the mechanisms that contribute to achieving improved clinical and related functional outcomes to reduce disparities in such outcomes. Proposed studies are expected to test models, theories, and conceptual frameworks of the implementation process that account for the available resources of the targeted care settings. An additional area of interest includes testing the potential for cross-system collaboration(s), using a deployment-focused approach that takes into account the perspectives and needs of multiple stakeholders, including end-users (e.g., consumers, providers, administrators, payers). The tested approaches should be developed with consideration for the realistic constraints in organizational structure, provider availability and training, organizational or provider capacity and other relevant factors specific to the type of low-resourced setting being addressed. Studies should be formulated to contribute generalizable strategies that, if effective, can be rapidly disseminated and implemented across a broad range of real-world settings. NIMH encourages research that utilizes novel technology to assist in the implementation, fidelity, delivery, and feedback of clinical and organizational processes in the implementation of EBPs (see [NOT-MH-18-031](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-mh-18-031.html)). When indicated, strategies should incorporate health information technology (HIT) and electronic health records (EHR) to coordinate care and monitor outcomes. A variety of methodologically rigorous approaches may be indicated for testing the impact of the proposed implementation strategies. These approaches may include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental designs with non-randomized comparison groups, time series designs, and other designs of equivalent rigor and relevance. Considerations for selecting a research design for the proposed study include the scientific question that the study is designed to answer, practical constraints, ethical issues, and the tradeoff between maximizing internal and external validity, and the design being used should be justified in the application. Applicants are strongly encouraged to propose EBP implementation strategies that identify factors that facilitate sustainability (e.g., utilization of existing personnel or realignment of responsibilities to facilitation impementation, effective financing strategies, response to staff turnover, technological factors), scalability, and generalizability to other settings or geographic regions. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Proposed studies should be statistically powered to provide a definitive test of the implementation strategy's effectiveness in comparison to usual care practices in the setting. Support for pilot studies to promote the development of and evaluation of the initial feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of implementation strategies is provided via [PAR-21-283](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-283.html) .

Resource Sharing Plan: Individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the Resource Sharing Plans as provided in the SF424 (R&R) Application Guide. The following modifications also apply: All applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must address a Data Sharing Plan To advance the goal of advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded under this FOA are expected to share those data via the [National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive](https://nda.nih.gov/) (NDA; see [NOT-MH-19-033](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-19-033.html)). Established by the NIH, NDA is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. NDA links data across research projects through its Global Unique Identifier (GUID) and Data Dictionary technology. Investigators funded under this FOA are expected to use these technologies to submit data to NDA. To accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a GUID for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. The NDA web site provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1) [the NDA Data Submission Cost Model](https://nda.nih.gov/contribute_cost_estimation.html) which offers a customizable Excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the Program Director/Principal Investigator and Data Manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the NDA's [Data Contribution page](https://nda.nih.gov/contribute/contribute-data.html). Investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this FOA prior to submission to NDA and review their data for accuracy after submission. Submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every January 15 and July 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see [NDA Sharing Regimen](https://nda.nih.gov/contribute/sharing-regimen.html) for more information); Investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. The NDA Data Sharing Plan is available for review on the [NDA website](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nda.nih.gov/Documents/NDA+Data+Sharing+Terms+and+Conditions+01.01.20.pdf) .

Use of Common Data Elements in NIH-funded Research Many NIH ICs encourage the use of common data elements (CDEs) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a \"Common Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal\" ( [http://cde.nih.gov/](http://cde.nih.gov/)) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects. NIMH has released expectations for collecting common data elements when an application involves human research participants. Details can be found at [NOT-MH-20-067](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-20-067.html) and the [NIMH webpage on Data Sharing for Applicants and Awardees](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/managing-your-grant/nimh-data-sharing-for-applicants-and-awardees). Applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in [the policy](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=82299). Any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy. Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the [NIH mission](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149) are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. In addition, for applications involving clinical trials: A proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials Are the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms? For trials focusing on clinical or public health endpoints, is this clinical trial necessary for testing the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention that could lead to a change in clinical practice, community behaviors or health care policy? For trials focusing on mechanistic, behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or other biomedical endpoints, is this trial needed to advance scientific understanding? Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials With regard to the proposed leadership for the project, do the PD/PI(s) and key personnel have the expertise, experience, and ability to organize, manage and implement the proposed clinical trial and meet milestones and timelines? Do they have appropriate expertise in study coordination, data management and statistics? For a multicenter trial, is the organizational structure appropriate and does the application identify a core of potential center investigators and staffing for a coordinating center? Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials Does the design/research plan include innovative elements, as appropriate, that enhance its sensitivity, potential for information or potential to advance scientific knowledge or clinical practice? Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials Does the application adequately address the following, if applicable Study Design Is the study design justified and appropriate to address primary and secondary outcome variable(s)/endpoints that will be clear, informative and relevant to the hypothesis being tested? Is the scientific rationale/premise of the study based on previously well-designed preclinical and/or clinical research? Given the methods used to assign participants and deliver interventions, is the study design adequately powered to answer the research question(s), test the proposed hypothesis/hypotheses, and provide interpretable results? Is the trial appropriately designed to conduct the research efficiently?

The application's PHS Human Subjects and Clinical Trials Information should reflect the manner in which these policies will be implemented for each study record. These plans will be reviewed by the NIMH for consistency with NIMH and NIH policies and federal regulations. The NIMH will expect clinical trials to be conducted in accordance with these policies including, but not limited to: timely registration to ClinicalTrials.gov, submission of review determinations from the clinical trial's data and safety monitoring entity (at least annually), timely submission of reportable events as prescribed, and establishment of recruitment milestones and progress reporting. Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA. ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the \"responsible party\" must register and submit results information for certain \"applicable clinical trials\" on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website ( [https://register.clinicaltrials.gov](https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/)). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see [https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm) Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the awardee must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols. Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398). Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE). All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159). More information is provided at [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158). Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex. This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html) and [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html). HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA.
