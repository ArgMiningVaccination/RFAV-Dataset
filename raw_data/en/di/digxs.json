Use the information below to help you find licensed assisted living facilities in Henderson that follow local laws, adhere to regulations, and can safely meet you or your loved one's needs. Licensing and grading system Assisted living facilities in Nevada must be licensed under the category of Residential Facilities for Groups by the [Bureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance](https://dpbh.nv.gov/Reg/HealthFacilities/HealthFacilities_-_Home/) (HCQC). The license ensures each community provides qualified senior care. This [fact sheet on Residential Facilities for Groups](https://dpbh.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dpbhnvgov/content/Reg/HealthFacilities/HF_-_Non-Medical/Residential_Facilities_for_Groups_(Files)/FACT-Sheet-ALAC.pdf) summarizes the standards of these assisted living communities in Nevada, as outlined by the HCQC. Nevada's Division of Public and Behavioral Health ranks residential facilities with an inspection-based grading system. Inspectors note concerns on staff and safety with the following grades: - An assisted living facility with an \"A\" grade has either minimal or no concerns. - Those with a \"B\" grade have multiple concerns or issues with their administration that may cause harm to residents if left unaddressed. - To earn a \"C\" or \"D\" grade, an assisted living facility must have several issues with their administration, concerns that have already caused harm to residents, or both. After receiving a \"C\" or \"D\" grade, the facility must be reinspected until it receives an \"A\" or \"B\" grade. Residential support requirements Assisted living communities must meet seniors' evolving needs and reduce the likelihood that they'll need to move to another community. These communities are also required to foster their residents' independence. Therefore, assisted living facilities in Nevada are not allowed to admit residents that are bedridden, require restraint, or require 24-hour skilled nursing care. The exception to this rule is if the senior qualifies for HCQC-approved hospice care. Room requirements Senior residents' rooms must be at least 80 square feet for a private room. In a shared room, there must be at least 60 square feet of floor space for each senior resident. Shared rooms can't have more than three residents. Caregiving staff Nevada assisted living facilities with over 20 residents need at least one employee on-site who's awake at all times. Caregivers must be at least 18 years old and complete care-related training, such as CPR and first aid. If the facility provides memory care, staff should receive specialized [memory care training](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/memory-care-staff-training) on Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Inspection reports The Nevada Department of Health and Human Services (or DHHS) inspects each Residential Care Facility for Groups before it's licensed. These facilities are also inspected after a complaint has been filed. You can find public inspection reports in Nevada's Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) [Provider Search Form](https://nvdpbh.aithent.com/Protected/LIC/LicenseeSearch.aspx?Program=HFF&PubliSearch=Y&returnURL=~/Login.aspx?TI=2#noback).
