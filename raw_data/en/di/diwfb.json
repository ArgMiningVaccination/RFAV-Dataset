Melissa Comments MY BABY DEFEATED SEIZUREI Submitted by SHARON CHARLES on Sun, 2017-04-02 - 23:35 MY BABY DEFEATED SEIZUREI have to share this story; it could help someone out there. A mother, father or loved one facing stigma caused by epilepsy and seizure. There is hope. Thank you to the Admin of this blog for sharing this story.Joan was born a healthy baby until after 6 months when her seizure started. We took her to the hospital where doctors diagnosed her of seizure disorder. She had more than 50 grand-mal seizures in a single day. It was terrible for our little angel. Doctors gave us Pharma meds upon meds. (Phenobarb and Keppra) which caused her more complications. She was so young that the side-effects were really bad on her. We went back to the hospital where doctors told us that she might not survive more than 24 months. I and my husband went in search for better treatment that will reduce her complications and keep her alive. We never gave up on her. We started searching for at least a treatment without Pharm meds. Fortunately for me, I came across a testimony shared by Brenda Coker on how her baby was cured from epilepsy using AVENS herbal medication. I followed the email she shared and also read Dr. AVENS blog. We realized that there was hope for our baby. We started AVENS treatment, she responded very well, and became Seizure free after 5 months of Herbal medication. Joan is 5 years now and never had any seizure. She survived doctors' predictions of 24 months.As a mother, I am here to encourage people with seizure or epilepsy to contact Doctor AVENS for your cure through his WHATS-APP NUMBER +2349077873085, or email, doctoravens@outlook.com Hello, I have been having Submitted by Joe.sunberg on Sun, 2018-08-05 - 15:35 Hello, I have been having these episodes when I am about to fall asleep or trying too. My legs and body kind of \"shake\" And then stop, and I get shortness of breath? Feels like a \"mini\" seizure, or seizure Anyone? Re: Holistic/ Alternative Submitted Wed, 2007-08-29 - 13:38 Look into Neurofeedback can be very helpful. there is diets to try. I have not tried acupuncture but I plan to in the near future. also check out my site in links has alot of info about all these.

Another idea is seeing a chiropractic service but I do believe that if you choose either one, you have to stay positive w/ a belief that they will work. If you have either therapy done please advise. I'll be having that video EEG study done shortly but I don't know what the diagnosis will be and I'm looking into everything right now. Thanks, DLM Re: Holistic/ Alternative Medicine/ Acupuncture Submitted by kcharb on Mon, 2007-09-03 - 22:41 I have definitely wanted to get away from shoving pills down my throat all day long but I have never even known where to start looking. I've seen how acupuncture is done but it looks painful and just out of curiosity, how would that help with epilepsy? Kim Re: Holistic/ Alternative Medicine/ Acupuncture Submitted by Anonymous on Tue, 2007-09-04 - 09:04 I understand people's frustration when usual therapies don't work, but keep in mind that there is very little research on many of the alternative therapies still. While some appear very promising, some sound good but don't work. Do your homework just like you would do it for medicines. I'll try to pull up some of the latest work on these topics but in the meantime, look around the site. There's also a book out called Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Epilepsy that will help. It also has a section on what questions people should be asking about different therapies. You can get this through the Shopping area of the site. Hope this helps!Epi_help I'll try to pull up some of the latest work on these topics but in the meantime, look around the site.

Only around ten times the length of time for modern western medicine. Hmmmm, one thousand years vrs one hundred years. lol. Re: Holistic/ Alternative Medicine/ Acupuncture Submitted by scorpio on Wed, 2007-09-05 - 06:25 When I first tried acupuncture, in Singapore, a few years ago, I was having 5-10 absence/simple partial seizures per week. After ten days of, initially daily, treatment the seizures stopped and I remained seizure-free for the three further months I lived there, having one session a fortnight by the time I left. Back in the UK, my experience has been mixed: some practitioners are clearly better than others. Each course of treatment had a positive effect but some were more successful than others. That was some time ago; since when I have found a drug that controls my epi very well \u00e2\u20ac\" and its side-effects are tolerable (it is also \u00e2\u20acfree\u00e2\u20ac, under the UK\u00e2\u20acs National Health Service: acupuncture treatment is rarely so). However I would re-start the acupuncture immediately if I felt it was not working. The British Acupuncture Council is the national body that regulates and registers practitioners in the UK and, if you happen to live here, it is important to use one who is so registered. Many other countries have similar organisations. I do not pretend to understand how acupuncture works but a \u00e2\u20acseizure-count\u00e2\u20ac is about as objective a scorecard as I could invent. Chris Re: Re: Holistic/ Alternative Medicine/ Acupuncture Submitted by kcharb on Wed, 2007-09-05 - 17:57 To make sure I understand, is this something not practiced at all here in the U.S.? And as far as the meds that I take, I've done very much research on all their possible side affects which is the main reason I'm looking for something else... plus the fact that my seizures are still not completely under control. I'm 33 and have had epilepsy since I was 5; what's wrong with this picture? Re: Re: Re: on Wed, 2007-09-05 - 18:09 I don't suggest it. As far as I know, meds were meant to prevent seizures, not cure them. You're still going to have 'breakthtough' seizures, not stop them. If you ask any Neurologist, they will tell you as well, meds are meant to prevent seizures, not stop them. Re: Re: Re: Holistic/ Alternative Medicine/ Acupuncture Submitted by EarthMonkey on Wed, 2007-09-05 - 20:51 Acupuncture is practiced in the United States. It might be very available or very rare depending on where you live. If you live in the large urban areas that have a large Asian community and history it is very available (such as San Francisco, L.A., New York for example). Re: Holistic/ Alternative Medicine/ Acupuncture Submitted by edy_telephone on Thu, 2007-09-06 - 00:28 Cure implies a disease. However, epilepsy is not viewed as a disease, but a long-term disorder with an underlying cause, which may be controlled, not cured, by drugs. I have tried diverse alternative, but I have never stopped taking my medication. Acupuncture, traditional Chinese herbal medicine, flower remedies, color therapy, homeopathy, reflexology, yoga and meditation are some of therapies that may help those who suffer epilepsy. Beside taking my medication, now I am doing yoga and meditation and after almost a year and half, they have helped me to relax, to approach as a mental and spiritual discipline and to reduce stress and have more ability to halt a seizure by focusing on my breathing and other mental techniques. Don't stop taking your medication by yourself. It's dangerous and it may cause disasters. Do you want to try other therapies? Try them but don't stop your medication. Take care. Edy Re: Re: Holistic/ Alternative Medicine/ Acupuncture Submitted by scorpio on Thu, 2007-09-06 - 05:41 Edy, you are absolutely correct about not changing your medication when you have acupuncture treatment, both because acupuncture will not suddenly 'cure' you but also because of the increased risk of seizures when drug doseages are reduced (it takes a little time for the body to adjust). I should have made that clear in my comment earlier. Interestingly, my seizures actually got WORSE during the first few days of my first acupuncture treatment. However, they 'felt' very different: something was clearly happening and so I stuck with it. In retrospect I wonder if the acupuncturist was not pressing one or two buttons to see which ones I responded to and thereby plan a course of treatment. Chris Re: Holistic/ Alternative Medicine/ Acupuncture Submitted by MoonStar on Mon, 2007-09-17 - 02:17 Hi Melissaky, I have found the herbal treatment by herbalist Dr. John Christopher to be very effective. http://www.herballegacy.org/Nerves.html The one in particular that I follow is the B&B tincture which has Scullcap. They sell his herbal line on various sites. So far the cheapest place i have found them is www.herbsmd.com but you can also find single herbs elsewhere. Make sure you use the tinctures in alcohol. You can start with just Scullcap tincture. I would follow the following protocol: 30 - 45 drops in a little water spread apart 3 times a day and for three weeks massage the scullcap at the base of your scull and along spine just on your neck every hour during the day (i know this sounds like a lot but it is only for three weeks and during the day) There are two formulas Ear and Nerve formula with alcohol and the Nerve formula with glycerine. Alcohol is important to pull the essential parts of the herb out as well as getting it where it needs to go, but you might be able to use the glycerine formula (Nerve) to rub under the base of scull and along spine on neck. I would make sure you have plenty of b complex vitamins from a good source (if you are not familiar with high quality vitamins and herbs it is important to know that some b vitamins come from sewage... not a good source. So seek out high quality B vitamins to support your nervous system.) In regards to the medication you are currently taking, talk to your doctor about a proper way to lower dosages should you decide to ween yourself off them completely. Remember, it has to be done slowly and with great patience. The good thing about herbs like Scullcap and Oat is that they help the body with withdrawal. One last product I would like to share is from a company called Native Remedies. Their seizure formula is good to lessen the length of a seizure often stopping it immediately. http://www.nativeremedies.com/epi-still-seizures-remedy.html I hope you find this helpful. Best of luck to you. Moon "}
