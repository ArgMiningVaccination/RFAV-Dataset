{"title": "How Beauty Brand Founders Are Speaking Out Against Ongoing AAPI Hate", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast; Sarah Han", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/aapi-bestseller-beauty-collection-asian-american-founders-interview", "hostname": "allure.com", "description": "And how you can support their efforts.", "sitename": "Allure", "date": "2022-05-01", "cleaned_text": "As the [fastest-growing ethnic group](https://www.pewresearch.org/) in America \u2014 Asians are projected to surpass 46 million by 2060, nearly four times their current total \u2014 the struggles of the Asian and Asian American community can no longer be ignored. Between March 19, 2020 and December 31, 2021, 10,905 hate incidents against Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) persons were reported to [Stop AAPI Hate](https://stopaapihate.org/), a coalition \"dedicated to tracking and responding to incidents of hate, violence, harassment, discrimination, shunning, and child bullying.\" Out of that alarming total, 4,632 occurred in 2020, and 6,273 occurred in 2021, plainly showcasing an upwards trend. (It's important to note that actual numbers could very well be higher, due to underreporting.) This May, a collective of prominent Asian and Asian American beauty brand founders have joined forces to elevate the conversation surrounding AAPI hate \u2014 as well as shine a spotlight on AAPI resilience and show that we are stronger together. In addition to using their individual platforms to engage their communities in conversation, the founders have created a special, [limited-edition box](https://www.celebratingaapibeauty.com) filled with hero products from each brand \u2014 including the TikTok-viral [Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Dew Drops](https://www.allure.com/story/glow-recipe-watermelon-glow-niacinamide-dew-drops-review) and Allure-editor-beloved [Tower 28 ShineOn Lip Jellies](https://www.allure.com/story/tower-28-shine-on-lip-jelly-review) \u2014 with part of each box's proceeds going to charity. To celebrate the launch, Allure interviewed 10 founders from Cocokind, Fable & Mane, Glow Recipe, Hero Cosmetics, Jinsoon, Live Tinted, Mount Lai, and Tower 28 about what this AAPI Bestseller Beauty Collection initiative means to them. Allure editor Sarah Han: You know this and I know this, but in case it's fallen off of people's radars \u2014 the conversation surrounding AAPI hate (which has surged since the beginning of the pandemic) is far from over. How have you, as influential brand founders and CEOs, been using your platform to spark change? Priscilla Tsai, Cocokind CEO & founder: \"We've never felt more energized to make a difference and use our brand's platform to advocate for AAPI communities. I'm learning to use my voice and [Cocokind's platform](https://www.allure.com/story/cocokind-founder-priscilla-tsai-small-beauty-business-covid19-pandemic) in a way that feels authentic and genuine to us. This year is definitely the year of unifying to create a larger impact for [the] AAPI [community], and this Beauty Collection collaboration is a perfect example of that.\" Christine Chang, Glow Recipe co-CEO & cofounder: \"We have always tried to use [our platform](https://www.allure.com/story/the-allure-podcast-the-glow-recipe-founders-k-beauty-interview) to raise awareness around important social issues \u2014 whether that's having open conversations with our community about sustainability or uplifting Black voices and small businesses. When we saw the rise in hate crimes against the AAPI community, we immediately convened with our team to explore all the ways we could uplift our community and use our platform to spark change. Last year, we partnered with [Act To Change](https://acttochange.org/), an organization dedicated to putting an end to the bullying affecting our AAPI youth.\" Han: It's been over a year since the Atlanta spa shootings, and over two years since the Stop AAPI Hate coalition was formed. In what ways would you say the Stop Asian Hate movement has succeeded, and what do you think are some next steps we can take to ensure that hate crimes aren't as prevalent moving forwards? Ju Rhyu, Hero Cosmetics CEO & cofounder: \"The biggest win has been the growing awareness of [Asian hate](https://www.allure.com/story/asian-beauty-professionals-covid-racism-interview) in our society. The first step is to acknowledge that it exists and to recognize it as a problem. The next step will be much harder and will be changing the way [Asians are perceived](https://www.allure.com/story/objectification-asian-women-violence) and valued in American society. I'm not exactly sure what the solution is but I know one thing that I can offer is achieving success and adding to the landscape of beauty leaders \u2014 because [diverse voices](https://www.allure.com/story/asian-pacific-american-founded-beauty-brands) will ensure there is better representation.\" Sarah Lee, Glow Recipe co-CEO & cofounder: \"The fact that the Stop Asian Hate movement has inspired so many in our community to raise our voices and no longer be silent means it has already been tremendously successful. Too many Asians and Asian Americans have been raised by immigrant parents to keep our heads down and avoid conflict. This has had the opposite effect, as racists, bullies, and cowards misconstrue this as a sign that we, as a group, are easy to attack. It's important for us to not feel defeated and continue to call out hate crimes, [raise awareness](https://www.allure.com/story/asian-american-anti-racism-beauty-industry), and no longer remain silent or invisible.\" Han: In the immediate aftermath of the Atlanta spa shootings, we witnessed a surge in media coverage \u2014 some good, and some less so. Since then, it has often felt like the conversation has been halted, only to be reignited every time there's a horrific incident. In that vein, in what ways do you think the media has fallen short in reporting the ongoing racism and struggles that members of the AAPI community face? Tsai: \"The AAPI community feels like it is more united than ever when it comes to speaking out against AAPI hate. However, we need more support from mainstream media. Unless you are in a specific corner of the Internet right now, you might not even know that AAPI hate is happening all over the country! We need more people to rally with us to help spread awareness. The first step is simply acknowledging that this is the situation right now and that Asian hate is a dangerous, current, and real problem.\" To stay in the know and learn more about the Stop Asian Hate movement, visit the [organization's website](https://stopaapihate.org/) to read up on the latest news, reference national reports, and report hate crimes you've experienced as a member of the AAPI community. Han: How have you seen the Asian beauty community (and its allies) come together to raise awareness about Asian hate, pandemic-related or otherwise? Is there anyone in particular who you've for their candidness or behind-the-scene actions? Rhyu: \"This AAPI Beauty Box is just one of many ways I've seen the Asian beauty community come together to raise awareness, financially support organizations doing important work, and be a voice of change. I've been part of large conglomerate ERGs (employee resource groups) that have hosted workshops and seminars about representation and Asian hate. My fellow founders here (Priscilla and Amy), along with Olivia Munn, hosted an [AAPI awareness event](https://www.allure.com/story/cocokind-tower-28-lunar-new-year-beauty-collaboration) with the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum back in February. I feel lucky to be part of a community where there are Asian voices and leaders, and amongst people who are passionate and active in raising these issues to the surface.\" Jin Soon Choi, Jinsoon founder: \"This is the first time I've witnessed this level of discrimination. I think the more hate we see in the world, the more the Asian community has come together. It is amazing to see everyone stand up for the Asian community and express their support. My friend and fashion designer [Philip Lim](https://www.instagram.com/31philliplim/?hl=en) uses his extensive media platform in speaking out about Asian hate, which I greatly admire.\" Akash & Nikita Mehta, Fable & Mane cofounders: \"We truly admire the work from our fellow brand founders. The respective initiatives to raise awareness about Asian hate from all the brands in this AAPI box have inspired us to go further as a business and as founders.\" Amy Liu, Tower 28 CEO & founder: \"Our community has done such an incredible job coming together, and in some ways, I now feel closer to this part of my identity than ever before. Everyone involved in our AAPI Bestseller Beauty Collection has completely blown me away with their dedication to helping our communities behind the scenes. I'm truly inspired by their continued efforts to raise awareness and vision to create real change through community events, mentorship programs, advertisements, speaking engagements, donations, education, and more.\" Han: Where there's action being taken, there's also hope being disseminated. Looking towards the future, what gives you hope for the Asian community at least? Anything you'd like to highlight? Mehtas: \"We're glad to see more representation each and every day from our screens, both in TV and film, and the beauty retail environment with a growing presence of Asian-founded brands. The recent second season of [Bridgerton on Netflix](https://www.allure.com/story/bridgerton-season-two-makeup-artist-products-how-to) was a highlight for us as a South Asian brand, as it showcased the [ritual of hair-oiling](https://www.allure.com/story/indian-hair-oiling-technique) to a Live Tinted CEO & founder: \"I love seeing us all come together. We've been trained by society that we can't all win but the reality is that we are stronger together. It gives me hope for the next generation that this will just be the norm.\" Lee: \"I'm hopeful because I see change happening \u2014 the Asian community is being seen and heard. In May 2021, Rep. Grace Meng and Sen. Mazi Hirono introduced and successfully passed into law the [COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/937/text). While legislation like this is a stark reminder that hate and intolerance continue to exist in the United States, it's also a reminder that we, as a people, strive to do better, and there is recognition and attention at the highest levels of our government. At a more grassroots level, I was so happy that all of the brand founders I reached out to immediately said yes to collaborate for this AAPI Beauty Bestseller Collection Box. It was truly amazing to be able to brainstorm, strategize, and plan this initiative together with a shared vision of developing awareness and celebrating [AAPI Heritage Month](https://www.allure.com/topic/asian-pacific-heritage-month).\" Chang: \"The AAPI community has been seen as a monolithic group when it's a richly diverse tapestry of different cultures and traditions. I think the rising wave of communication about and celebration of these differences, especially on social media, is incredibly powerful. This is also part of what we wanted to represent through this collaboration \u2014 the power of founders and brands from different walks of life coming together for a cause that's deeply meaningful to our community.\" Stephanie Zheng, founder and CEO of Mount Lai: \"This AAPI beauty box is a perfect example of the Asian community coming together in support of each other. Collaboration over competition!\" Han: As successful entrepreneurs, your social justice efforts cannot discount the companies you have built from the ground up. How have your cultural background and upbringing influenced the direction in which you have taken your brands? Choi: \"My [Asian background](https://www.allure.com/story/immigrants-in-beauty-jin-soon-choi-manicurist-founder-of-jinsoon) plays a role in my entire brand, specifically the design of my product packaging, more in its elegant subtlety than overt Asian aesthetic references. I find that a person's cultural background will always be a natural, fundamental factor in their everyday life, and I am proud to say that this has been proven true for me as well.\" Tsai: \"I learned my skin-care routine from my mom when I was very young, and her beauty rituals were always anchored in hydration retention, moisture, and sun protection. I think many Asian cultures emphasize these factors when building a [skin-care routine](https://www.allure.com/story/beginner-skin-care-routine), which undoubtedly we have used as inspiration for Cocokind's products.\" Mutyala: \"Everything I do with my brand [ [Live Tinted](https://www.allure.com/story/deepica-mutyala-live-tinted-interview)] ties back to my culture. From the products we launch to the campaigns we build, and the events we host, it's all to celebrate my identity and culture. That's always been important to me and my hope is, that by doing this, it allows others to feel it's okay to authentically live their truth as well.\" Zheng: \"At its core, Mount Lai is a beauty brand offering facial tools and skin-care products rooted in traditional Chinese rituals. I grew up watching my grandmother incorporate jade rolling and gua sha into her skin-care and wellness routines. She also taught me the traditional Chinese medicine ideology of treating things from their root cause, rather than just the symptoms \u2014 and this holistic approach is something we incorporate into all of our products and formulations. So many of the ingredients we use in our skin-care products, like [tremella mushroom](https://www.allure.com/story/snow-mushroom-skin-care-benefits) and goji berry, are inspired by the beauty superfoods I grew up eating in the dishes my family would make. It's such an honor to get to share these parts of my culture with others.\" Liu: \" [Tower 28](https://www.allure.com/story/amy-liu-my-beauty-break-interview) is a beachy, LA-based beauty brand, and it often surprises people that it's founded by an Asian American. Growing up in California, I was always drawn to beach culture, but never saw myself represented in any of the products being marketing around it \u2014 everything was overwhelmingly blonde and white. I wanted to change that narrative with Tower 28 and create a brand that embodied the beach culture that I know and love, where everyone can enjoy a healthy, fun lifestyle no matter their racial or socio-economic backgrounds.\" Now, here's where you can join in on the action. To celebrate the diverse cultures represented by the AAPI population, and to raise awareness surrounding AAPI hate, the brand founders we've talked to have banded together to create a limited-edition box filled with products that your skin, hair, complexion, and nails will so deeply appreciate. Who doesn't love a deal at the end of the day? (And if you really love deals and curated boxes, the [Allure Beauty Box](https://beautybox.allure.com/) is always dishing out great beauty finds.) What's inside the box (valued at $183): - Cocokind Oil to Milk Cleanser - Fable & Mane HoliRoots Hair Oil - Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dew Drops - Hero Cosmetics Brave Body Power Wash - Jinsoon Nail Lacquer in Keppel, Sanbar, Coral Peony, and Plunge - Live Tinted Huestick in Rise - Mount Lai The Mini De-Puffing Facial Roller in Rose Quartz - Tower 28 ShineOn Lip Jelly in Chill (clear) $10 from every box sold will go to AAPI non-profit organizations benefiting the community. The collective would love to highlight [Heart of Dinner](https://www.heartofdinner.org/), an organization that strives to combat food insecurity and isolation within New York City's elderly Asian American community through the delivery of hot lunches and fresh produce, accompanied by handwritten letters in the recipient's native language. Yin Chang & Moonlynn Tsai, Heart of Dinner founders: \"Our elderly community often lives in cultural, linguistic, economic, and social isolation. Pair this with the overall lack of policy attention, resources from the government, and negative media portrayal, our elderly are historically shaped by society to be a perceived vulnerable and easier target for AAPI hate incidents. One way we can protect those who are most vulnerable is taking the one extra step to do something as simple as looking out for our neighbors.\" You can buy the limited-edition box for yourself or a loved one for $100 at [celebratingaapibeauty.com](https://www.celebratingaapibeauty.com) or at any of the retailers previously listed.
