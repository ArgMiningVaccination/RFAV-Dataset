SECTION II. SECTION III. SECTION IV. You have completed treatment for cancer and are now in recovery. Starting your recovery process and having to deal with post-treatment side effects and symptoms is not easy, but you can overcome these challenges. And always know that you don't have to do this alone. Getting back on track can be difficult at the beginning, but in or der to regain function, maintain health and deal effectively with possible side effects, planning a healthy lifestyle is extremely important. This chapter is for: People interested in learning how a healthy lifestyle will help them feel better and heal better. People interested in information on regaining a healthy lifestyle. This chapter will guide you through a self-evaluation, taking into account both your physical and emotional status. It will also offer ideas about how to get started so that you can create a plan to regain function that is designed specifically for you. This can be your first step towards a healthy and active lifestyle after cancer treatment. 4 Rosana Faria, Grant, Dietitian Sandra is a graduate of the Faculty of Science at McGill University where she majored in Dietetics and Human Nutrition.

During treatment you were supported by your healthcare team who helped you make important decisions about treating your illness. Now you are the one who can take charge of choices for your health that will help you regain your function after treatment. Perhaps this means looking at adjusting or changing your lifestyle to give you the best chance at recovery, and to feel better and healthier. Or, perhaps this means learning how to take steps to regain the healthy lifestyle you had before treatment. Having a healthy lifestyle after cancer treatment affects how you will heal: it will help make you feel stronger, boost your immune system, reduce cancer-related fatigue and post-treatment side effects that you may experience. With healthy living, you will also be able to more effectively manage any stress and enjoy life more. Your recovery process is unique to you; your lifestyle adjustments should be looked at in the same way. Listening to your body will help you decide what goals you would like to set for yourself \u2014 then you can draw up a plan of action for changes that you would like to make in your everyday life. Having a plan with realistic goals for healthy living will motivate you to continue until the changes eventually become a normal part of your daily routine. Remember that being active and having a healthy diet can help you restore your energy. The World Cancer Research Fund offers many recommendations for healthy living on its website, including the importance of nutrition, a healthy body weight and physical activity, and the relationship to the prevention of certain cancers: www.wcrf.org /int/research-we-fund/ our-cancer-prevention-recommendations . Living healthy means: Having good nutrition Maintaining a healthy weight Limiting or avoiding 'junk food' Limiting the consumption of alcohol Avoiding tobacco products Being physically active6evaluating yourself : think about your feelings and emotions , diet and activities Evaluating how you feel now , your current diet, physical routines and activities, and your lifestyle in general, is a good place to begin in your transition from treatment to recovery . Changing a lifestyle, diet or an everyday routine can be very challenging \u2014 get as much support as you need from family, friends and professionals as you move forward. There are many resources listed at the end of this section that you may find useful. When you evaluate your diet and daily activities (such as going to the grocery store, climbing stairs, going to work, driving, etc.), take into consideration your emotions around these things. Here are some examples of questions you can ask yourself. You may think of some others depending on your normal daily activities: Does washing dishes tire you out? Are you exhausted when you return home from shopping or work? Do you take pleasure in sitting down for dinner? Do you feel good or better after you have eaten a meal? You may have noticed that your body has changed in the course of treatment, and you may need to get to know it again to understand how it functions now. This will help you adjust your diet and activities to get the most benefits possible. Notes7Perhaps being diagnosed with cancer and going through treatment has changed how you think and how you see life. Identifying your values for living your life, and creating realistic goals and working towards them, could be a helpful way for you to establish your rhythm and lifestyle after treatment. As you put your plan for wellbeing into action, think baby steps. Add new changes gradually and let your body get used to its new rhythm. For example, if you smoke, you may first just want to focus on the possibility of quitting, and take small progressive steps toward your goal of stopping smoking. Tips, strategies and support are available at www.iQuitnow.qc.ca . You can find information on smoking cessation programs in section IV, On your way to recovery , page 27 , or speak with your healthcare team or pharmacist about available resources. If there are any other habits you would like to change, think of the easiest possible action you could take towards that goal. Living healthy is based on 3 pillars of support: nutrition, physical activity, and emotional wellbeing. All 3 of these items affect your mental and physical health. The following sections in this chapter will offer recommendations, tips and strategies for healthy living . GO FURTHER : Assessing your f Atigue And sleep problems Fatigue and sleep problems are very common after cancer treatment. These side effects can interfere with making lifestyle changes, especially if you feel overwhelmed. Understanding your cancer-related fatigue can help you manage your symptoms effectively. How many of the following situations are true for you? When I feel tired, overwhelmed and weak because of fatigue and sleep problems, I: Have to stop what I enjoy doing Feel worried Snore loudly when I sleep Need more effort to do something I used to do easily Fall asleep during the day Have difficulties concentrating, making it difficult to work Feel your symptoms more than 3 times a week If you answered \"yes\" to most of these questions, you may want to discuss these symptoms with your doctor. More information on fatigue and sleep problems can be found in chapter 2, Side effects and their symptoms . getting on track : finding a new rhythm * When you see this symbol, it means that if you are concerned about this topic, you may wish to have a discussion with your healthcare team. *8 Evaluate your daily lifestyle . Think about the changes you would like to make and are capable of making at this time. Start with small changes . Even something as basic as sitting or standing up straight or buying a new vegetable or fruit every time you are at the grocery store counts as a small change! Listen to your body . Accept the limits that it may have right now, and move toward steadily increasing your activity level. Respect your pace and acknowledge your accomplishments. Make time to laugh and have fun . Enjoy good times with friends and family, watch a movie, take the dog for a walk. Laughing can reduce stress and put you in a positive mood.

Good nutrition doesn't have to be complicated or time consuming - it could be as basic as making simple and practical changes to your eating habits. Focusing on food after cancer treatment can be a challenge. You may have experienced eating problems and/or weight changes during treatment, and perhaps you are still dealing with these symptoms. How you feel about eating depends on the type of cancer you had and the treatment you received. Incorporating new eating habits should be a gradual process and can be done in several ways. Tips and strategies are offered throughout the rest of this section.If you are taking any medications, or still undergoing any treatments, be aware that certain foods may interfere with medications or exacerbate side effects. For example, for about the first six weeks after surgery for colon cancer, it is recommended to limit spicy, fatty or greasy foods as well as drinks with caffeine. Another example is grapefruit which may interfere with medications. Depending on your situation, a dietitian may recommend a special diet. Share this information with your family, partner, friends and caregivers so that they can make healthy choices when grocery shopping. * When you see this symbol, it means that if you are concerned about this topic, you may wish to have a discussion with your healthcare team. *10Eating well after cancer treatment will give you energy and help strengthen your body. Healthy eating, along with physical activity and emotional wellbeing, can also help you reduce the risk of other health problems such as diabetes and osteoporosis. According to the American Cancer Society, studies have suggested that food choices may help reduce the risk of recurrence. For more information see www.cancer.org /acs/groups/content/@ editorial/documents/document/ acspc-037186.pdf , page 16 . The positive physical and psychological effects of eating well have been shown to be significant. If you would like to learn more about this subject, or get nutrition advice specifically designed for you from a professional, go to section IV, On your way to recovery , page 28, for information about health and nutrition workshops, and access to dietitians and nutritionists . Eating well includes eating a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains and proteins. It is also important to keep your body hydrated by drinking a lot of fluids. The best way to begin is by taking control of the situation, and creating and preparing healthy meal options at home. Keep it simple to start and try to enjoy being creative. If you are unable to cook , try making very simple meals, or ask a family member or caregiver to prepare meals for you. Plan ahead, with help if necessary, and fill your fridge and freezer with healthy foods that can be easily and quickly transformed into balanced meals and snacks. Some suggestions are: soups dried fruits and nuts cereals with milk crackers or rice cakes with cheese pasta or rice with vegetables or meat sauce peanut butter and jam seeds, honey, pickles canned tuna, salmon, and sardines the importance of eating well healthy eating 11Proteins play an important role in your body by helping maintain a healthy muscle mass and a healthy immune system. Certain foods help the body to create proteins, which promote healthy function. HigH protein foods nuts and seeds legumes cheese, milk, yogurt tofu, soya cooked meat, poultry, fish and eggsTry to feel comfortable asking for help from others for shopping or cooking. While it may have been obvious to the people caring for you that you needed this help while you were in treatment, people often forget that recovery can sometimes be challenging as well. Friends and family members are usually pleased to be able to make these tasks easier for you, and perhaps share a good meal and conversation at the same time! If eating is a problem due to dry mouth and/or difficulties swallowing, talk to your doctor or dietitian about alternatives that would be right for you at this time. You can, then, gradually add in your usual foods when you feel comfortable doing so. If you are losing weight, find more information on weight loss on page 15 . Drinking water every day is essential; it helps you to feel better and function better. The average intake for a healthy adult is between 1.5 and 2.5 litres a day, and more when you are active or in hot conditions. If you have fever, diarrhea or any other health condition, the amount of water you need to drink, and how often, may need to be adjusted. Make sure you are getting enough calories, proteins and nutrients in your diet. During your recovery process, you may need more calories to boost your energy. You will find them in carbohydrates and good fats. You can usually add these types of calories into your meals and snacks quite easily. For example, add avocado or olive oil to a salad, a sandwich, a sauce or cooked vegetables. Here are some examples: CArboHydrA tes fruits bread pasta legumes (e.g., beans, peas, lentils) good fA ts olive oil nuts and seeds avocados *12Eating well includes food safety. It is important to avoid adding germs to your body, especially within one month of finishing your treatment, since your immune system is recovering. Wash your hands before eating and cooking. Wash vegetables and fruits before eating or cooking them. Separate food that will be eaten raw from food that will be cooked. Use separate grocery bags and cutting boards for items that need to be cooked before eating, such as meats, fish, poultry and eggs, and vegetables. If you are eating out, avoid buffet style meals and raw or uncooked meat, poultry, fish and eggs, as these foods may contain higher levels of germs and bacteria. For healthy living, there are some foods that should be eaten with caution. Limit eating red meats to less than 18 ounces (510 grams) a week. Avoid processed meats like deli meats and bacon. Avoid frying, broiling and grilling meats at very high temperatures to avoid charring. Certain types of cooking can create chemicals that may increase the risk of cancer. Limit your intake of 'fast foods' and sugary drinks. Limit your consumption of alcohol. The World Cancer Research Fund advises that if you drink alcohol, limit consumption to 2 drinks a day for men and 1 drink a day for women. \"Adding a variety of colourful vegetables to your stir fry, and sprinkling a variety of herbs and spices, such as turmeric, black pepper, and thyme, will provide an abundance of protective anti- oxidants. Anti-oxidants can help protect the body from damage caused by pollutants in our environment, such as dioxins and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\"top tips - Sandra Grant, Dietitian13GMO or genetically modified organism. GMOs are plants or animals that have had their genes changed in some way or have had genes from another plant or animal added to their own. GMOs are commonly used in the food industry and are considered safe according to Health Canada. Here are pros and cons according to Christy Brissette, Clinical Dietitian at Princess Margaret Hospital ( www.ellicsr.ca ). Pros : Genetically modifying crops increases their resistance to pesticides, plant diseases, cold and drought. GMOs ripen slower and are also used to maximise nutrients in a crop. Cons : GMOs can cause allergies. No studies have been done on their long-term effects on human health. Organic describes foods that haven't been grown with pesticides and/ or GMOs. It is also a term used for meat, eggs, dairies and poultry that are not from animals that have been raised on antibiotics or hormones. While it is thought that organic foods reduce the risk of exposure to certain chemicals and may have better nutritional value, according to the American Cancer Society there are no current human studies showing that organic foods are better at reducing the risk of cancer or cancer recurrence (www.cancer.org /treatment/survivorshipduringandaf - tertreatment/nutritionforpeoplewithcancer/nutrition-and-physical- activity-during-and-after-cancer-treatment-answers-to-common-questions ). Milk and dairy products . We grew up being told that dairy products are good for our health and bones; however, there are now many conflicting messages about this advice. Dietitians currently recommend drinking or eating dairy products with lower percentages of milk fat, such as skim (0%) or 1% milk. If you would like more information about special diets, such as gluten free, juicing or macrobiotics, visit www.ellicsr.ca /en/connect_with_ ELLICSR , and have a look at their blog and read the posts from Christy Brissette, Clinical Dietitian at Princess Margaret Hospital.people are asking about ... \"Contrary to popular belief, Canadian dairy products do NOT contain hormones. Although American dairy farmers are allowed to use hormones to increase the milk production of their dairy cows, this practice is banned in Canada. So you can enjoy a refreshing glass of low fat milk without worrying about hormones.\" - Sandra Grant, Dietitian14weight change Your eating habits and your weight may have changed during or after treatment. Some people gain while others lose weight, depending on the type of cancer and treatment. WeigHt gAin During your cancer treatment, you may have eaten more to help with nausea, to deal with stress and anxiety, or because you were less active due to fatigue and tended to snack more often. There are also other reasons for weight gain during or after treatment. For example, menopause, hormone therapy and steroid medication can all contribute to weight gain. Significant changes in weight may have physical and/or emotional health consequences. If you have concerns, and would like help and guidance, you can speak with the dietitian at your cancer centre. Eat plenty of vegetables , fruits and whole grains. Try to eat smaller portions . Limit fat, sugar, refined flour and salty foods (which make your body retain water). Eat healthier by steaming or baking food instead of frying. Avoid skipping meals . This will not help you lose weight more quickly and is not healthy. Drink lots of fluids . Exercise . Walking, cycling and other muscle strengthening exercises can help maintain a healthy weight.

Also, after-treatment side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, trouble swallowing, fatigue and depression can lead to weight loss ( find more information on these side effects in chapter 2 ). After treatment, it is important to get back to a healthy weight in order to have more energy, feel better, and manage and reduce side effects effectively. To help you regain weight, it is essential that you eat healthy food on a daily basis, including foods that contain more calories (examples below in Top Tips ). Eating smaller portions more often may make this easier for you, and try to eat your main meal of the day when you feel hungry. Also, drink fluids throughout the day to stay hydrated. If you had weight loss during treatment and are now unable to gain weight, you may want to speak to a dietitian at your cancer centre for an assessment; they can help you find the best approach to get back to a healthy weight. Choose foods containing more calories and proteins . You can add extra protein to your diet with foods such as: peanut butter cheese eggs Eat high protein/low fat foods , such as: fish poultry nuts and seeds legumes Eat healthy fats (fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids), such as: olive oil avocado flax seed and walnuts Eat when you are most hungry - this can vary for each person. Make a rainbow on your plate! Eat foods of different colours. Eat high calorie foods first . This is a good strategy if you fill up quickly at meal time. Set goals for your weight gain . For example, eating 500 calories more a day usually results in a weight gain of approximately 1 pound a week.top tips16managing side effects with food Depending on what type of cancer and treatment you had, you may experience side effects and symptoms. These are caused by cancer or its treatment when some of your healthy cells, in addition to cancer cells, are damaged. Side effects vary from person to person, as well as over time. Some of these side effects influence how much and how you can eat. With the right plan and follow- up with your healthcare team, you should gradually be able to get back to eating the way you did before treatment. Anemia is a lack of healthy red cells in your body. The main symptoms of anemia are fatigue and dizziness. Eat more foods high in iron, such as red meat or from plant sources, such as dried beans, spinach, pumpkin seed, and almonds. For high iron foods from plant sources, be sure to combine them with a vitamin C source, such as oranges, red or green peppers, and tomatoes. To treat the anemia directly, your doctor may prescribe iron supplements, folic acid pills or vitamin B12. If you are experiencing changes in taste or smell , this can also affect your eating habits. You may want to try adding extra seasoning or sauces to your meals to give them more flavour. Serve your dishes at room temperature; this will help to bring out the flavours of the food. Some medicines and cancer treatments cause constipation . Foods like prunes, rhubarb and papaya are natural laxatives. In general, adding more fibre progressively to your meals, such as whole grains, cereals, brown rice, dried fruits, seeds and nuts usually helps relieve constipation. Make sure to also drink lots of fluids. In some situations, you may need a prescription for a laxative or stool softener. On the flip side, some cancer treatments and medicines cause diarrhea . Drink lots of non-carbonated, caffeine-free fluids, eat small meals more often during the day, and reduce the fibre in your meals. Eat more foods like pasta, bananas, melons, potatoes, meat, poultry and fish. Limit your intake of greasy, fried, sugary and spicy foods, as well as the natural laxative foods listed above with the information on constipation. Choose instead salty foods, such as soups, sports drinks, crackers and pretzels. If you have diarrhea for more than 24 hours, or if you have pain or cramps in your stomach, you should talk to your healthcare team. *17Combining healthy eating with a physical activity (when you can) may help your recovery process even more. Energy booster foods for before exercising, or for any time during the day: yogurt fruit milkshake and smoothies cereal bars whole grain crackers with peanut butterIf you are experiencing dry mouth or thick saliva , try adding more moisture to your meals with foods such as broth, soups, sauces, gravy, creams and butter or margarine. You can also try pureed foods, which generally contain more liquid. Drink lots of fluids during the day, avoiding caffeine, which can make your mouth even dryer. Keep your favourite fluid with you in a bottle or thermos so that you can drink regularly throughout the day. You can also try chewing gum or sucking on candies. Fatigue is one of the most common after-treatment side effects, and can significantly affect the basics of your everyday life, such as grocery shopping, cooking and even eating. To manage cancer-related fatigue, try eating foods with more calories and proteins; this may help you restore energy. See page 11 for how to get more calories and proteins into your meals . It is important to keep your body hydrated by drinking lots of fluids. Think about eating when you have the most energy. Do not hesitate to ask for help with shopping or to prepare meals. If you are experiencing vomiting and nausea , try the following approaches to help prevent and manage these side effects: Eat slowly, eat smaller portions, and take your time after eating by relaxing while sitting up. Drink fluids in small sips. But remember to keep drinking plenty of fluids during the day. If you can't cook because the smell makes you nauseous, ask people to cook for you or heat up a prepared meal from the freezer. Avoid greasy, fried, sugary or spicy foods. Also, cold foods are easier to tolerate. * top tips18 Vary your diet \u2014 test new recipes using items from all the food groups. Eat at least 8-10 servings of fruits and vegetables each day: 1 serving is equal to \u00bd cup of vegetables or fruit (fresh, frozen or canned) or 1 cup of leafy raw vegetables or salad. Snack on vegetables and fruits . Limit red meat (beef, pork and lamb) to a maximum of 3 to 4 servings a week (18 ounces/510 grams). Avoid smoked, salt-cured and pickled foods , such as bacon, sausage and deli meats. Choose low-fat dairy products and high-fiber foods , such as whole-grain and cereals.

Perhaps you became more attentive to your health and self-care, and decided to incorporate good health habits during treatment. Now is an excellent opportunity to pursue these habits. And, even more, you can inspire people around you to do the same! - Rosana Faria, Psychologisttop tips19Physical activity is one of the 3 pillars that support healthy living (the other 2 are nutrition and emotional wellbeing). It is strongly recommended that you try to incorporate some physical activity into your life after your cancer treatment, to help you heal and regain function. Being active means to move your body. You can begin with any activity that you enjoy, and that can be done at a light to moderate intensity, depending on your health and fitness level. If you were active before your treatment, you may not be able to pick up where you left off. Take into account what kind of activities or exercise you used to do, what you are capable of doing now without over-exerting yourself, and if you have any physical challenges post-treatment. Focus on building your fitness gradually and be patient with yourself. Level of intensity: LIGHT > Easy Does not cause sweating unless it's a hot, humid day. There is no noticeable change in breathing (the activity doesn't cause you to breathe harder). Examples: walking on a flat surface at a slow pace or strolling. Level of intensity: HIGH > Hard Will cause sweating after 3-5 minutes. Breathing becomes deep and fast. You can only talk in short phrases. Examples: Jogging, running, high- impact or step aerobics, tennis, backpacking, bicycling on steep hills, and most competitive sports such as football or hockey . Level of intensity: MODERATE > Somewhat hard Will cause sweating after performing the activity for about 10 minutes. Breathing becomes deeper and more frequent. You can carry on a conversation but not sing. Examples: walking at a moderate or brisk pace, 3 to 4.5 mph, bicycling on level ground 5 to 9 mph, water aerobics, yoga, ballet exercises, golf, light weight training, light aerobic exercises.section iii. physical activity what is being active ? 20To help assess the level of intensity of your activity at any time, you can use the 'talk test'. While exercising, try to talk and say a full sentence; if you succeed, you are in the right range of light to moderate. If talking is too difficult or if you are breathing hard, you should lower the intensity. However, if you can sing a song, your level of intensity is too easy and you can ramp it up a bit! With time, you will be able to continually increase the level of intensity of your chosen activity. Here are some other tips when thinking about starting to exercise. Being active positively affects your physical and mental health. It reduces cancer-related fatigue and increases muscle strength, improving your body composition by balancing fat, bone and muscle. Research has shown that exercise can help reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel disease, diabetes and osteoporosis. In addition, studies of breast, colorectal, prostate, and ovarian cancer survivors showed that people with higher levels of physical activity after diagnosis tended to live longer and were less to experience a recurrence of cancer. For more, see information from the American Cancer Society at www.cancer.org / acs/groups/content/@editorial/documents/document/acspc-037186. pdf, page 28 . Be active when you have the most energy . Use your energy wisely \u2014 don't overdo physical activity at the beginning. Incorporate physical activity into your regular activities . For example, try parking further from the door to your work than usual, to walk a few extra steps. Begin slowly , even if it's only a few minutes a day. Your body will let you know when you should slow down and rest. Try exercising for short periods and rest in between. For example, walk briskly for a few minutes and then slow down. Continue until you have walked briskly for a total of 30 minutes. Remember the 4 important parts of exercise : stretching, strengthening, aerobics, and balance. Consider gradually including these types of exercises to your routine: stretching to improve flexibility, muscle strengthening with light weights or resistance bands, aerobic activity to increase your heart rate, and techniques like heel raises to improve balance.top tips!21In addition to helping you regain strength and improve your recovery after treatment, physical activity also helps you sleep better, helps reduce stress and anxiety, and may help boost self-esteem. The World Cancer Research Fund (2016) recommends 30 minutes of moderate physical activity a day, most days, increasing to 60 minutes as fitness levels improve. Recent advice from The American Cancer Society and the American College of Sports Medicine recommends 150 minutes of exercise per week, including strength training at least 2 days a week. NEEd ExTRa HElp? While some people will be able to begin an exercise routine safely on their own, others will see better results with an exercise specialist. A physiotherapist or a kinesiologist can assess your fitness level and create a progressive plan that will work best for you. The objective is to move forward with recovery and to have fun \u2014 and especially to enjoy your chosen activity. For information on programs in the community and on referrals to exercise specialists, see section IV, On your way to recovery , page 25 . If you are experiencing physical limitations due to treatment or surgery, you can ask for a referral to a physiotherapist. This therapy may be covered by provincial health insurance or private insurance, if you have coverage. A physiotherapist will assess your current abilities and functional needs, and develop a plan to help you reach your physical health goals. For information on how to find a physiotherapist that will fit your needs, go to section IV, On your way to recovery , page 27. If you have serious physical limitations, which are affecting your daily living or your ability to return to work, an occupational therapist can teach you how to work with these challenges to carry out your daily activities. They may also recommend changes to your home or work environment. For example, an occupational therapist may recommend voice recognition software for a person with limited use of their hands or arms, or the installation of a shower seat for people with reduced mobility. For information on how to find an occupational therapist, go to section IV, On your way to recovery , page 28. When you see this symbol, it means that if you are concerned about this topic, you may wish to have a discussion with your healthcare team. *22A breath of fresh air : it is impossible to play down the importance of breathing. It seems like this goes without saying; however, stress and anxiety can cause breathing to become tight and irregular, leading to more stress and anxiety! Relaxing and breathing can help reduce stress and anxiety, and improve overall flexibility. Breathing exercises increase the oxygen flow throughout your body. Try practicing with small deep breathing exercises: breathe in slowly through your nose, hold your breath for a few seconds, then breathe slowly out through your mouth. Repeat the cycle at least 3 times. For guided deep abdominal breathing exercises, visit www.mcgill.ca/cnr /patient-resources/relaxation-cd . If you are experiencing cancer-related fatigue, it can be hard to imagine yourself being active. When you understand what your body is able to do at this time, you should be able to add the right type of activity to your routine, and doing this will help counteract the effects of fatigue. Try to be more active in your daily routine: use the stairs instead of the elevator if you can, park further away from the door of your work or of a shopping centre, so you can take a short walk. Be careful not to overdo it - a little goes a long way. Aim to eventually exercise at least 150 minutes per week, focussing on bone and muscle strengthening twice a week. Avoid exercising 4 hours before going to bed, to improve your chances of sleeping well.managing side effects with physical activitypREca UTiONs FOR ExERcisE If you have anemia (low red blood cell count). If you have a low white blood cell count, or take medicine that makes it harder for your body to fight infection, your should avoid places where you are more at risk for infections, such as at public gyms. If you have vomiting or diarrhea, swelling anywhere on your body, unrelieved pain, or other symptoms that concern you. If you have shortness of breath with small amounts of exertion, or extreme fatigue. If you have balance problems. Make sure to exercise on an even surface to avoid falls or injuries. If you have osteoporosis, arthritis, nerve damage, poor balance, poor vision, or overall weakness, to not injure yourself or break a bone, do not exercise with heavy weights. Ask for advice from a professional for exercises that will not put too much stress on your bones. *23Physical activity can also help your digestion, and may help you with side effects after colon, rectal, thyroid cancer treatments. Sip water while exercising; the more you sweat the more you should drink. Wear comfy clothes in layers that can be easily taken off. Take your medicine for diarrhea (if any) before you exercise. Go to the bathroom prior to starting your session.It may be helpful to use a scale when discussing the level of your fatigue with healthcare professionals. For example: 0 to 10 (10 being the worst) 0 = no fatigue 1,2,3 = mild 4,5,6 = moderate 7,8,9 = extreme 10 = the worst Warm up (with shoulder shrugs, lifting arms above the head, knee lifts, for 2 to 3 minutes) and cool down (with some stretching, holding stretches for 15 to 30 seconds at a time). These are 2 important steps to include at the beginning and at the end of each exercise program. Think gradual . Start small, especially if you have been inactive, and extend your activity sessions progressively. Pace yourself according to your level of energy. Schedule your choice of activity in your calendar for when you usually have the most energy. Focus on having fun . Ask family or friends to join you in your activity. Recognize and reward your achievements. ALICE, recovering from rectal cancer, age 71 ''Even though I was active before, I always had a leaden feeling with the chemo and the radio. It's like you've been run over by a truck. I felt a physical change after starting at the gym, however. I regained muscle and I got my physical energy back. When you feel physically well, you confront challenges differently. Y ou know, you are stronger, physically and mentally.''top tips24cOmplEmENT aRy THERapiEs Emotional wellbeing is one of the 3 pillars that support healthy living (the other 2 are nutrition and physical activity). As you face the many challenges that come with life after cancer treatment, you may find complementary therapies an interesting area to explore. The focus of complementary therapies is on health and healing, and overall wellbeing of the body, mind, and spirit. Complementary therapies include: meditation, reflexology, aromatherapy, art therapy, healing touch, massage therapy, reiki and biofeedback. Many people have found that these kinds of activities have had a positive impact on their emotional wellbeing; and, in some cases, these therapies may be able to help relieve post-treatment side effects such as fatigue, nausea and pain. For more detailed information about complementary therapies and how they can help, see the Canadian Cancer Society booklet, Complementary Therapies , available for download at: www.cancer.ca /~/ media/cancer.ca/CW/publications/Complementary%20therapies/Com - plementary-therapies-2016-EN.pdf .

Try doing something that will match your energy level that day. You can set yourself small goals and do activities more often, rather than setting a big goal and being discouraged when you cannot reach it. It's important to enjoy your activity of choice, whether it be dancing, gardening, or practicing Qi-Gong, for example. And why not participate in a group or ask others to join you, so that it can be even more pleasurable!\" - Maria Milioto, Physiotherapist pHysiOTHERapisT s You can speak to your healthcare team about a referral to a physiotherapist.
