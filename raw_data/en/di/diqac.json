You are awake if you see that there are numerous reasons to be concerned for our survival. Some of these instances include: When our freedom to refuse a vaccine is threatened; when the very food we eat is modified in such a way that it provides little nutrition and modifies our genetics in an unhealthy way that promotes illness; when the water we drink is toxic; when 5G and smart meters constantly bombard our energy systems with harmful frequencies and force honeybees to face extinction; when information sources cite stories that serve to divide rather than unite. You are more awake if you recognize that this is also happening: that we are searching for truth, empowering ourselves with education, and standing up for our basic rights when we opt against vaccines, choose locally grown and organic foods, support and advocate with organizations fighting against water pollution and electromagnetic radiation, and take other stances toward health and freedom. And, we are most awake when we come together in community, because we are stronger together. There is a theory in quantum physics called the holographic model which states that every piece contains the whole, or everything is interconnected. So, when we are awake, we realize that whatever we do, \"good\" or \"bad,\" affects this entire planet and every living thing on it. Therefore, if the world in which we live seems like it has a lot of negativity occurring, then it becomes the call to those who are awake to take action toward positivity. Sometimes, you are awake, and the action to take seems unclear. Remember, one piece contains the whole. Every time you make a change in your life toward living in accordance with the laws of nature (this is what natural health is), you affect every being on this Earth. In this, and every, edition of the NITE Light, we strive to give you steps to take action or inspire you to create your own path of positive movement. Because, as we consider the \"Survival for the Awake,\" I ask you: do you want to survive, or would you rather thrive? I wish you the most joyful thriving!

PFAS stands for per - and poly -fluoralkyl substances. These compounds have been historically known as PFC's, or per- and poly -fluorinated chemicals, and this term is still sometimes used. According to Elsie Sunderland, a professor at Harvard University, there are more than 4,000 different types of PFAS chemicals, and scientists are just beginning to understand their effects. While the chemical bonds of PFAS makes them effective at repelling water and oil even at high temperatures, these same chemical bonds make them very persistent, meaning that they are extremely difficult to break down, especially once they are in the body. PFAS are being found to be pervasive in public water systems and around military bases across the country. Health effects associated with exposure include cancer, breast cancer, liver damage, kidney disease, decreased fertility, increased risk of asthma, weakened immunity, and thyroid disease in humans. Studies also indicate that PFAS may affect the health of unborn babies and developing infants by influencing growth, development, and behavior. These chemicals can increase cholesterol and interfere with the body's natural hormones. In the fall of 2017, Sandy Wynn -Stelt of Plainfield Township, Michigan, learned that her well was contaminated with PFAS at more than 500 times the Environmental Protection Agency's \"safe\" level for drinking water. She has lived across the street from a Wolverine Worldwide liquid waste dump since 1992. Two years ago, her husband, Joel, died from liver cancer at age 61; Wynn -Stelt believes her husband's cancer was caused by the PFAS pollution from the dump. When she had her blood tested in January, test results showed that she had 750 times the average amount of one of the PFAS chemicals in her blood as the average American. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found PFAS chemicals in the blood of virtually all Americans. Last year, an American Red Cross study showed that the blood of an average American has 4,300 parts per trillion, or ppt, of PFOS and 1,100 ppt of PFOA. Sandy Wynn -Stelt's blood test showed 3.2 million ppt of PFOS. One part per trillion is about one drop of water in 1,000 Olympic -size swimming pools. PFOS is the chemical in Scotchgard that Wolverine Worldwide used to waterproof Hush Puppies and other shoes. PFOA was formerly used to make Teflon. These two chemicals were phased out under pressure from the EPA, and both chemicals are now banned in the U.S.; however, manufacturers have replaced them with structurally similar chemicals that may not be any safer. In 2016, Philippe Grandjean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Richard Clapp of the University of Massachusetts at Lowell calculated that an approximate safe dose of PFOA and/or PFOS in drinking water is 1 ppt. Sandy Wynn -Stelt's well has more than 37,000 times that much PFOS, and a well less than 10 miles away from the Wolverine dump has 59,000 times that much. Some states have set levels for PFAS in tap water or groundwater that are lower than the EPA advisory level or are legally enforceable: Vermont has adopted a legal limit of 20 ppt for both PFOS and PFOA in groundwater and tap water. Minnesota set advisory levels of 27 ppt for PFOS and 35 ppt for PFOA in tap water. New Jersey adopted legal limits of 14 ppt for PFOA and 13 ppt for PFNA in tap water. Michigan set a legal limit of 70 ppt for PFOS and PFOA in groundwater used for tap water. The latest update of an interactive map by EWG and the Social Science Environmental Health Research Institute at Northeastern University, which is the most comprehensive resource available to track PFAS pollution in the U.S., documents publicly known PFAS pollution from 94 sites in 22 states, including industrial plants and dumps, military air bases, civilian airports and fire training sites. Much of the increase since the map was first published is in Michigan. In fact, we have been referred to as the \"current hotspot\" of the crisis. 5 5 The NHIFF is Coming! Be There July 4th - July 7th 2019 The Natural Health Independence Freedom Festival Earlier this year, President Trump's administration released a toxicology report about these nonstick chemicals endangering human health at significantly lower levels than the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has previously called safe. The draft report from the Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) is a toxicological profile of four types of stain - and water - resistant chemicals. The report finds that \"minimum risk levels\" for the toxins should be seven to 10 times lower than the standards set by the EPA in 2016. The lowest level included in the ATSDR report is 12 parts per trillion in drinking water, which is greater than 80% below the current maximum safe level that the EPA has advised for two types of PFAS. So, we are just beginning to learn that not only are there more toxic sites developing and affecting our water, but that the PFAS levels that were previously considered \"acceptable\" have been far, far higher than any level that is even close to safe. As this crisis is just beginning to unfold, keep in mind that you are exposed to fluoride in dental products, floss, and many medications, including antibiotics, antidepressants, anesthetics, antacids, antihistamines, steroids, cholesterol -lowering medications, and anti - inflammatories. Here is a list of remedies to help the body displace and detox fluorinated chemicals: Iodine, Selenium, Methionine, Magnesium, Calcium, C, Vitamin E, Nitric Oxide, GABA, medicinal mushrooms like maitake, shitake, reishi, and lion's mane, the cell salt Calc Fluor, infrared saunas, and ionizing foot soaks. For a personalized program to address prevention and your level of exposure, please consult a naturopath. Herbs etc. now carries purifiers that remove 95% of the fluoride in drinking water, and we can recommend testing and more extensive removal equipment.

These toxins are in the food we eat, the water we drink and bathe in, and the air we breathe. Each human has an average of up to 420 harmful chemicals in their blood, urine, and hair. We have to wonder: how are these toxins impacting our health? One pathway for major damage starts with our gut health. Poor gut health is the root cause of many of today's health challenges. A healthy bacteria balance in the gut and in the overall body controls many key body functions such as: Respiratory, Neurological, Skin, Blood Sugar, Glandular, Weight, Immune and Urinary as well as emotions and energy. When we have all of this toxic burden paired with stress and poor lifestyle and diet choices, this disrupts the healthy balance of bacteria in the gut leading to poor health. This happens because the healthy bacteria are compromised in the body which allows pathogenic bacteria to overgrow and release endotoxins. These endotoxins weaken the gut as well and leak through the gut lining and into the blood stream. When these toxins get into the blood stream, they impair all body functions. How it works: UltraBiome DTX was formulated to help our body handle and recover from toxic burdens. It consists of a proprietary phytonutrient blend that offers free -radical protection to reduce oxidative damage to the gut. This aids detox pathways to help the body target and eliminate toxins. It also promotes the growth of healthy bacteria, supporting microbiome balance and healthy intestinal permeability by strengthening and tightening cellular junctions. Benefits: Restores bacteria balance in the gut Supports Heavy Metal Elimination Purification of the Gut Supports healthy intestinal permeability Sustains energy and optimizes nutrient absorption Supports a balanced glucose response Rejuvenaid and How It Works: A natural, clinically studied, Nitric Oxide -generating supplement, Rejuvenaid safely produces and sustains superior levels of NO. Unlike other NO products, this patent -pending formula uses a dual system featuring a proprietary beet root extract along with L -Arginine. This dual-pathway approach frees up the body's ability to produce its own NO while using the ingredients to generate even more NO. Rejuvenaid also features a proprietary, polyphenol rich antioxidant blend called Herbal Shield that offers select vitamins to help sustain higher levels of NO and support circulation. Enjoy youthful vitality with Nature's Sunshine's Rejuvenaid: a natural, healthy way to achieve and maintain peak physical and mental performance with higher levels of vigor. Clinical studies have shown that higher levels of Nitric Oxide (NO)\u2014a signaling molecule that improves blood flow and circulation by relaxing arteries and blood vessels \u2014are associated with increased vitality, physical performance, stamina, recovery, mental acuity, sexual performance, and lower blood pressure. Made in the endothelial layer of blood vessels and arteries, NO is quickly used or oxidized within the body and must be replaced constantly. A sedentary lifestyle, suboptimal diet, and age can each negatively impact NO production. (By age 40, the human body produces only half the nitric oxide it did during teen years.) Benefits: Superior Nitric Oxide Levels Brain Circulation Improved energy production Increased exercise capacity and stamina Supports optimal brain circulation Healthy sexual performance Cardiovascular and heart health function Healthy blood pressure Decreased body fat Overall vascular health and blood vessel elasticity Improved blood flow to vital organs Gut health and related immune function UltraBiome DTX and Rejuvenaid By Nature's Sunshine Products at Herbs etc. 77 New Purify 2.0 The Ultimate Detox The Science To Back it Up: Clinical results show that Purify 2.0: Increases heavy metal elimination up to 76% Lowers gut inflammation by 35% Reduces cardiovascular risk by 22%, including improvements in blood pressure, triglycerides, and cholesterol Improves liver function by 21% Benefits: Helps detoxify the body Supports the elimination of heavy metals Supports healthy intestinal permeability Helps purify the gut and balance bacteria Increases feelings of energy and vitality* Enhances circulatory/heart health function Supports gut health with essential proteins and nutrients How it Works: Purify 2.0 is composed of four products: UltraBiome DTX provides unparalleled support for heavy metal detoxification.

New Holiday Gift Baskets and Wrapping Station 10 10 This seed rotation plan has been a valuable piece to restoring hormonal balance for both women and men. It works so well, because the hulls of the seeds contain nutrients called lignans, which help modulate the hormonal pathways of the body. The seed oils are comprised of essential (or omega) fatty acids that provide the building blocks for steroid hormone synthesis. As each seed type contains variations for these lignans and fatty acids, rotation of these seeds through the month provides the body with the variety of precursors it needs to create normal hormonal cycles. Women: the rotation plan can be done according to either the menstrual cycle (if it is fairly regular) or phases of the moon (if the menstrual cycle is absent or too irregular). From days 1 to 14 of the menstrual cycle (or from the new moon to the full moon), have 1 Tablespoon per day of a mixture of ground flax and pumpkin seeds. From days 15 to 28 of the menstrual cycle (or from the full moon to the new moon). have 1 Tablespoon per day of a mixture of ground sesame and sunflower seeds. Hormone Rebalance: Seed Rotation Plan Shared by Suzy Sikora, ND Men: the rotation plan is done according to the phases of the moon (and opposite of the women's rotation). From the full moon to the new moon, have 1 Tablespoon per day of a mixture of ground flax and pumpkin seeds. From the new moon to the full moon, have 1 Tablespoon per day of a mixture of ground sesame and sunflower seeds. Seed Preparation: It works best to use a coffee or spice grinder to grind the seeds. Only prepare a few days' supply at a time, as the seeds may oxidize and become less potent. Store the ground seeds in a jar with a tight -fitting lid and keep in the refrigerator. One or two tablespoons per day can be used. You can eat the seeds on salad, cereal, vegetables, or mix them in a little rice or soymilk and drink them. It adds a nutty, crunchy taste to foods. It is best to use organic and raw seeds. (Dr. Pinault, MS, LAC, ND) 11 11 Introducing Health to Community! We will teach classes in your home to your family and friends.

It also stimulates the production of interferon and virus antibodies as well as production of liver detoxifying enzymes that help eliminate toxic waste products from your body, including environmental chemicals to which you may have been exposed. All of the environmental toxins that we are exposed to from our food, air, and water cause oxidative stress in the body. Oxidative stress causes damage to our DNA within our cells that can leave you vulnerable to multiple degenerative diseases, including cancer. Numerous studies have been conducted that show how vitamin C (anti -oxidant) reduces your risk of certain non -hormonal cancers, sometimes by half compared to patients with low vitamin C intake. According to Dr. Linus Pauling, daily intake of vitamin C aids in anti -cancer activity and assists in repairing damaged arteries and removing arterial plaque. Taking Vitamin C is more effective than what flu shots \"claim to be.\" A good maintenance program is 1,000 mg a day. To fight the flu and cold, you can take up to 10,000 mg a day. Inflammation Vitamin C significantly increases wound healing, reducing the inflammatory response. Vitamin C prevents and fights chronic inflammation in our body due to its anti -oxidant properties. Eyes and Skin Research suggests that supplemental Vitamin C reduces the risk of cataracts by up to 70%. Vitamin C (1,000 mg per day) may help to prevent age -related macular degeneration. Cataracts and macular degeneration are also conditions that are a result of oxidative stress, and increased vitamin C can help prevent these and other \"signs of aging.\" Vitamin C is used by your body in the formation of collagen, the elastic tissue that keeps your skin looking young and keeps your blood vessels strong. This means that Vitamin C will prevent wrinkles! Adrenals The highest concentration of vitamin C in the body is stored in the adrenal glands. Vitamin C is used by the adrenal glands in the production of all of the adrenal hormones, especially cortisol. This means that when you become stressed, your vitamin C is quickly used up in the production of cortisol and other related stress -response hormones. When you do not have enough vitamin C, your adrenals will \"panic\" and release MORE cortisol which results in the belly fat we are all trying to avoid. This over production of stress hormones causes anxiety and blood sugar and pressure imbalances.
