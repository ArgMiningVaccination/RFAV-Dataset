In this blog post, I will give a detailed analysis about Dampness and all the related questions that you may have for this topic. Dampness is one of the causative factors that can cause illnesses and diseases in the body. To understand how dampness is a cause for illnesses and diseases, it is noteworthy to see that the causes of diseases in accordance with Traditional Chinese Medicine include: -lack of physical exercise -improper diet -traumatic injuries -bites from insects and animals -stagnant blood and phlegm fluid For dampness, there are two general categories: external dampness and internal dampness. External dampness falls under the group of [six exogenous factors](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/root-for-illnesses-6-external-factors) that cause diseases, while internal dampness falls under the group of stagnant blood and phlegm fluid that cause illnesses. External dampness can invade the body due to exposure to damp weather or wearing wet clothes or prolonged stay in places of high humidity usually in late summer. Internal dampness can be seen as a condition of high humidity within the body. Internal dampness is more common, and I will explain the mechanism or pathogenesis of how internal dampness is created from inside the body in the later part of this article. How Dampness causes Diseases and Illnesses in General according to Traditional Chinese Medicine Classically, dampness relates to conditions of viscosity and stagnation. Therefore dampness as a disease causing factor is Yin in nature. This Yin nature impairs the Yang and easily cause Qi stagnation in the body, which means all movements and circulation in the body (Yang property) is slowed down by dampness (Yin property). And when movements and circulations within the body are impeded, blockages and obstructions result which then bring about other illnesses and diseases. This is in line with the [philosophy of Traditional Chinese Medicine on disease causality](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/why-acupuncture-works). Formation of Dampness in Body according to Traditional Chinese Medicine So how is dampness created or formed within the body to eventually result in illnesses? According to Traditional Chinese Medicine theories, \"the Earth element creates dampness and the Metal element stores it.\" Earth element refers to the Stomach and Spleen or simply digestive system while Metal element refers to the Lungs and Large Intestine. For internal dampness, it is usually directly due to the impaired functioning of the digestive system. With poor digestion, any food that goes into the digestive system will not be fully transformed and assimilated. The food that is not digested will stay in the system and remain as dampness or phlegm. Since we have mentioned that the Earth element creates dampness and the Metal element stores dampness, dampness that is created like to end up in the Lungs and Large Intestine. When dampness goes into the Lungs, the usual symptoms seen is the presence of phlegm while coughing. This is especially prominent after the person eats something that is inherently difficult to digest such as milk shake, other cold dairy products, greasy foods). When dampness is stored in the Large Intestine, the usual symptoms seen are mucus-lined stools, loose stools, sticky stools that are hard to clean up, diarrhea with undigested food bits, frequent intestinal rumblings. So why poor digestion in the first place? Diet is the main contributing factor for poor digestion. What type of food is eaten, when the food is eaten, how the food is eaten are some of the factors that can determine the quality of digestion for a person. Other contributing factors for poor digestion are [emotions](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/tcm-science-healing-importance-of-negative-feelings-and-emotions) , [sleep](https://drxiangjun.com/tcmwellness/tcm-wellness-sleep-and-mental-health-management) and [stress](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-stress-management). Diet What type of food eaten 1. Cold raw foods Cold raw foods can easily impair the digestive fire or Spleen Yang and cause digestion to weaken. Thus it is harder to fully digest any food given to the system, resulting in indigestion and the transformation of the indigested food to dampness retained in the body. 2. Heavy, rich, sugary food and dairy products Heavy, rich, sugary food and dairy products are known to possess the quality of dampness. Taking such foods are literally just introducing dampness directly into the system which impedes and further slow down the digestion to result in indigestion and formation of more dampness over time from other foods. When the food is taken 1. According to the Traditional Chinese Medicine Body Clock theory, [7am to 9am is the Stomach time ](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/tcm-body-clock-7am-9am) [while 9am to 11am is the Spleen time](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/tcm-body-clock-7am-9am) . When food is taken at this time, the food is transformed and assimilated most efficiently. However frequent skipping of breakfast or eating food at the less optimal timings such as late nights will result in the foods not fully digested and in turn retain as dampness and impede the digestion system even further. How the food is taken 1. Eating too fast and not chewing enough before swallowing can result in over burdening of the Stomach and Spleen. When that happens, digestion is slowed down and obstructed, resulting in retainment of undigested food which will transform to dampness and retain within the body system. 2. Overeating can result in food stagnation which leads to the digestive system not functioning properly. When that occurs, dampness is formed and retained. This gives rise to clinical presentations such as foul belching, sour regurgitation, distention, bloating, pain in the epigastrium and abdomen, loss of appetite, vomiting and diarrhea. Emotions In Traditional Chinese Medicine, emotions play a big part in the causation of illnesses. This is because emotions are basically energy in motion and Traditional Chinese Medicine honors the role of emotions in health. Each main organ system in Traditional Chinese Medicine has an associated emotion that it expresses. When the organs are in balance, we feel the emotions but do not retain them and hold on to them. When the organs are out of balance, we feel the emotions closely associated to the one organ that is ill more and for longer period of time. This association of emotions and organs is two-way. Therefore when a healthy person constantly feels or displays certain emotion for a prolonged period of time, the emotion can in turn hurt the organ that it is related. In the case of digestion (Spleen and Stomach), [worry and pensiveness](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/root-for-illnesses-worry) are the emotions in close association to the organs mentioned. When someone is in a state of constant worry and overthinking, it weakens the Stomach and Spleen energy as the energy is channeled to fuel the emotions rather than on digestion. Hence poor digestion will start to develop. Sleep Sleep is necessary to nourish all the internal organs and reenergize for their functioning the next day. When sleep is disrupted or not enough, all organ systems will be affected. Therefore at the Spleen and Stomach, poor digestion will become significant with poor or lack of sleep. Stress In Traditional Chinese Medicine, stress disrupts qi flow and circulation in the body. With poor qi and blood circulation, all organ systems will not be functioning at their optimum. Spleen and Stomach will be weakened with stress and hence poor digestion ensues. Formation of Dampness in Body according to Science and Western Medicine According to Science and Western Medicine, the organs that cause dampness to retain in the body in the form of deranged water metabolism go beyond just the Spleen and Stomach (digestive system). The Lungs which produce arginine-vasopressin that acts on the kidney nephron to alter water balance in the body are one of the organs that can result in dampness especially when the circulation of the Lungs are disrupted or blocked. Mineral corticoids of the adrenal glands which sit on top of the Kidneys also regulate water balance in the body via the kidney nephron. When the adrenal glands are overworked through stress and prolonged release of adrenaline, this can result in the retainment of water in the form of dampness in the body. The Liver produces angiotensinogen that assists in water balance via the angiotensin-renin-aldosterone system. The Kidney produces rennin that assists in the regulation of water balance in the same system as mentioned above for Liver. Therefore when Liver and Kidneys are malfunctioned or diseased, they will also cause some form of disrupted water metabolism. Characteristics of Illnesses and Diseases due to Dampness As mentioned above, dampness has the characteristics of heaviness, thickening, viscosity, slowing down and stagnating. Therefore, illnesses and diseases that result from dampness similarly have such presentations. - Sluggish energy and feeling of heaviness - Swelling or edema or water retention - Lymphatic swelling - Stool that is viscous or sticky and difficult to expel smoothly - Bloatedness or distension in stomach - Chest tightness due to qi blockages and stagnations - Poor appetite - Tongue diagnosis shows thick, sticky or greasy looking coating - Pulse diagnosis is slippery in quality, a characteristic sign of dampness - All conditions of dampness will yield to treatment only after a long term concerted and persevering regimen Common Illnesses and Diseases due to Dampness \u00b7 [Obesity](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-weight-loss) \u00b7 [Diabetes](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-diabetes) \u00b7 Cancer and tumours \u00b7 Metabolic disorders \u00b7 Heart disease \u00b7 Cognitive impairment \u00b7 Autoimmune disorders \u00b7 Fibromyalgia \u00b7 Allergies, asthma \u00b7 [Eczema](https://drxiangjun.com/tcmwellness/skin-health) \u00b7 Brain dysfunction \u00b7 Cholesterol deposits appearing as white, dark colored patchy and rough raised splotches around the eyes Treatment of Dampness with Traditional Chinese Medicine Acupuncture Acupuncture points have properties that can clear dampness from the body system. For example a classic acupoint used to treat dampness is ST36 or Zu San Li which acts to strengthen the Spleen and Stomach and disperses Damp-Heat and Wind-Damp in the whole body. In scientific terms, acupuncture can calm the nervous system and activate the parasympathetic nervous system. In other words, it puts the body in the rest-and-digest mode. With that, it strengthens the digestion system which encompasses the Spleen and Stomach. This will naturally clear the dampness existing in the form of undigested and unwanted substances in the body. Herbal Medicine There are different ways to clear dampness using herbal medicines. Some of the mechanisms of how the herbs can clear dampness are: - Promote urination and leach out dampness - Induces sweating to release exterior -Transform damp turbidity -Warming and transform water and dampness -Dispel Wind-dampness -Invigorates Spleen -Moves water and diminishes swelling Common herbs used that can Self Help Tips for Clearance or Reduction of Dampness in Body Dietary Therapy As dampness are mostly formed internally and any adverse effects on the Spleen system (or digestive system) will eventually result in the formation of dampness, dietary therapy will be one of the main solutions for resolving health conditions arising from dampness. And it is something that a person can do for himself or herself without the help from doctors but through awareness and knowledge. 1. Avoidance of heavy, rich, sugary foods and dairy products Foods that fall under this category include eggs, milk, cakes, confectionaries, biscuits, milk chocolate, bubble tea, alcohol, beer, high sugar content fruits 2. Avoidance of cooling and cold foods 3. Take more dampness clearance foods Foods that fall under this category include Red bean, China barley, Chinese Yam, [Orange peel](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/supermarket-herbs-orange-peel), sweet potato, Fava bean, Chinese Red Spinach. Reduce exposure to external dampness External dampness can invade the body due to exposure to damp weather or wearing wet clothes or prolonged stay in places of high humidity usually in late summer. 1. Use a dehumidifier So if you are staying near to the sea or ocean or forest, be sure to have a dehumidifier to reduce the humidity in your living environment. 2. Change out of wet clothings fast Change out of wet clothings as soon as possible and not believe that it is ok to just let the clothes dry by itself on your body. By then your body would have absorbed lots of external dampness. 3. Keep feet protected Our soles of the feet are highly sensitive areas that can absorb and retain any energy that they come into contact with. So wear room slippers while walking in the house especially if you have cold floors made of marble and such. Wear socks to sleep in bed if you are staying in an environment of high humidity such as near to sea or forest. Yoga Therapy Sun Salutation This ancient series is passed down for centuries not without its good reason. The Sun is the origin of life and all life depends on it. The Sun burns and sanitises naturally as you can see the tradition of drying your clothes or anything you want to refresh and avoid mould growing. Mould is in fact a form of dampness as well. Therefore the series of Sun Salutation will literally clear out any dampness in the body, provided there is a regimen that one religiously adhere to. Conclusion Retainment of dampness in the body is something very common in modern society today due to the highly processed diet and food products easily made available to us. Furthermore, sedentary lifestyle, stress, poor knowledge in how to take care of ourselves made clearance of dampness more difficult than it seems. Although lifestyle habits can help to a certain extent in clearing dampness, Traditional treatments are still the main solution to remove dampness fully. The characteristics of dampness are usually sluggish, sticky, viscous. In reflection, the conditions caused by dampness hold these characteristics as well. Patience and conscientious effort to upkeep with regular Traditional Chinese Medicine treatments such as Acupuncture, Herbs are much needed to treat and cure such conditions effectively and fully. One will be grateful for keeping their body dampness conditions in check considering the number of diseases that can emerge from retainment of dampness over prolonged periods of "}
