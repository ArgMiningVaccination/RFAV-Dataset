It also seems to have antibacterial and [antifungal](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/medications-skin-conditions)effects. People commonly use lavender for anxiety, stress, [insomnia](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/insomnia-symptoms-and-causes), [depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/understanding-depression-basics), [dementia](https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/types-dementia), pain, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. Uses & Effectiveness ? Possibly Effective for - Anxiety. Taking a specific lavender oil supplement (Silexan) by [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-mouth-problems)seems to help relieve anxiety. Using lavender oil [aromatherapy](https://www.webmd.com/balance/video/aromatherapy-benefits)or aromatherapy [massage](https://www.webmd.com/balance/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits)also seems to help. - Depression. Taking lavender products by [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/rm-quiz-mouth-myths), including teas and a specific oil supplement (Silexan), or inhaling lavender oil as aromatherapy, seem to reduce [symptoms of depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/detecting-depression). [Menstrual cramps](https://www.webmd.com/women/menstrual-cramps)(dysmenorrhea). Lavender oil aromatherapy seems to help reduce menstrual pain. Possibly Ineffective for - Pain in people with cancer. Using lavender oil aromatherapy with massage doesn't seem to reduce cancer-related pain more than a massage without aromatherapy. Side Effects [constipation](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-constipation), [diarrhea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea), and [headache](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/migraines-headaches-basics). When applied to the [skin](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/picture-of-the-skin): Lavender is possibly safe. It's usually well-tolerated, but can sometimes cause [skin](https://www.webmd.com/teens/teen-skin)irritation. When inhaled: Lavender essential oil is possibly safe. It's been used safely as aromatherapy for up to 12 weeks. Special Precautions and Warnings [constipation](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-constipation), [diarrhea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea), and [headache](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/migraines-headaches-basics). When applied to the [skin](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/picture-of-the-skin): Lavender is possibly safe. It's usually well-tolerated, but can sometimes cause [skin](https://www.webmd.com/teens/teen-skin)irritation. When inhaled: Lavender essential oil is possibly safe. It's been used safely as aromatherapy for up to 12 weeks. Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if lavender is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children: Lavender essential oil is possibly safe when inhaled as aromatherapy. But applying products that contain lavender oil to the [skin](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-conditions-faq)is possibly unsafe for young males who haven't reached [puberty](https://www.webmd.com/children/ss/slideshow-puberty-stages). Lavender oil seems to have hormone-like effects that could disrupt normal hormones. In some cases, this has resulted in breast growth. There isn't enough reliable information to know if lavender is safe for children to take by mouth. Surgery: Lavender might slow down the [central nervous system](https://www.webmd.com/brain/what-is-nervous-system). If used with anesthesia and other [medications](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx)given during and after surgery, it might slow down the central nervous system too much.
