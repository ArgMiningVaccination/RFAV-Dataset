Meet Julie Where did The Nutrition and Wellness Center come from? Julie Mitchell's passion for wellness for her family and herself. It all began in the early 90s when it wasn't cool, popular or as accessible.

Naturopathic focuses on the root cause of disease, rather than simply treating symptoms. It takes an integrative and individualized approach to health, with the goal of restoring balance within the body. How is Naturopathic different from traditional medicine? Traditional medicine generally looks at the body as a collection of separate systems, each with its own set of diseases. Naturopathic, on the other hand, views the body as one interconnected system. It also considers each person's unique circumstances, including lifestyle, diet, environment, and genetics. Do you accept Health Spending Accounts? TNAWC does accept Health Savings Accounts. These expenses can be applied to your insurance deductible and allow you to use your money on your preventive health instead of managing diseases. This includes all therapies and prescribed high-quality supplements. Do you accept insurance? TNAWC does not accept medical insurance. Here at TNAWC we have the freedom to make recommendations for testing, appointments, etc. that we believe are necessary and effective.
