Forget PTSD; I think we're all in the midst of CTSD: current traumatic stress disorder. Because, you know, there's a virus out to kill us all and the future is uncertain. I'm not making light of this, not one bit; I've had plenty of low moments lately, including a few bordering on panic. Meditation can help. Before you snort and click away, know this: I once thought the practice was only for hippies and weirdos. I didn't think it could benefit me, and I felt like it would be embarrassing to do it. Wrong, wrong and wrong again. It is, quite possibly, the best thing you can do for yourself, especially now.

If you try one and find it helpful, those fees are probably a small price to pay. This is mental health we're talking about. It's hard to beat free, however, which is why you absolutely cannot pass up this deal: For a limited time, Elevate is offering a [free one-year subscription to Balance: Meditate](https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1361356590?mt=8). It's currently for iOS only, with an Android version listed as \"coming soon.\" (Alas, don't expect it before the end of the year, according to Elevate.) Read on to learn how exactly you get this freebie. After installing Balance, the app will walk you through a series of questions designed to tailor a meditation plan to your specific needs or preferences. For example, having trouble sleeping? You can choose that as one of your priorities. When that part's done, the app will start with you a quick sample meditation. Eventually you'll get to the main menu, where you can tap Profile and then Upgrade. Then you'll see the option to snag the free one-year subscription. Doing so activates automatic billing, meaning that one year from now, you'll pay $50 for an additional year unless you cancel. (Mark your calendar, just so you don't forget to make a decision when the time comes.) The app offers a wide range of meditations for all needs. You can stick with your Foundations Plan or venture off into Singles, which cover topics such as Anxiety, Breaking Habits, Motivation and even SOS (for when you quickly need some calm). This is really an amazing giveaway, one of the best I've seen for a meditation app. Even if you still scoff at the idea, try it for a week. You have nothing to lose and some much-needed calm to gain. Note that you've got until April 15 to take advantage of this offer.
