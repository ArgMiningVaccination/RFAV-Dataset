Participants provided their professional contact information and nominated up to three names per practice area. Portland Monthly compiled the top vote recipients in each area. There was not enough differentiation among vote tallies for mental health professionals to identify a group of top vote recipients. Information was fact-checked but is subject to change. Note that providers may rent space in a clinic, work at a clinic within a clinic, or work at multiple locations. "}
