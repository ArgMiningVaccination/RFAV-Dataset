No matter how healthy we try to be, most of us are laden with toxins - from the food we eat and the water we drink, to the air we breathe and the thoughts we think. Your body-mind-spirit engine does a lot of work to keep you functioning. Why don't you give it a break? It is a \"whole\" body-mind-spirit approach, providing a sensible plan you can follow as you go about your daily activities. You don't have to go away on a retreat to experience renewal.

There are no expensive detoxification formulas to buy. The core elements of the program include: - suggested meal plan with recipes and daily log - planning and shopping guide, including convenience options for those who don't want to juice or cook - explanation of skin cleansing via dry skin brushing and hydrotherapy - instructions on simple yoga poses and breathing techniques - an \"after day\" plan for sustainable and green living - additional support through suggestions on space clearing, journaling, affirmations, meditation and visualization The Detox program is a jumping off point for conscious living. Know what, how and why you eat, discovering what works for your body and what does not. Part of your success depends on your preparation. You may have all of the best intentions in the world, but if you don't have the tools readily accessible and a very specific game plan then you are likely to be disappointed. You must set yourself up for success. The program provides everything you need. The contents of the book include: PART ONE: SETTING THE STAGE Chapter 1: Why Detox?

It is part of the larger Power Living\u00ae philosophy. Power Living\u00ae is being spiritually connected, mentally focused, physically energized, emotionally engaged and environmentally supported. It is a way of being that allows life to flow. It is committing your energy to what you care about on a day-to-day basis. On a practical level, Power Living\u00ae is knowing who you are and what you value and then organizing your life around it - what you do for work, who you choose to love, when and what you eat, and how you communicate with your Self and others. On a deeper level, it is living on Purpose, not just with purpose, allowing you to uncover and release your innate power. The philosophy is grounded by the Five Principles of Power Living\u00ae: 1. Live on Purpose - aligning your spiritual energy 2. Tune your Mind to the Positive - focusing your mental energy 3. Honor your Body - maximizing your physical energy 4. Be a Humble Warrior - engaging your emotional energy 5. Sanctify your Surroundings - detoxifying your environmental energy The Seven-Day PWR Detox supports all five principles. As you begin to clear away the physical toxins (Honor your Body), you can more readily tune into your mental state (Tune Your Mind to the Positive) and tap into your core spirit (Live on Purpose & Be a Humble Warrior). In other words, paying attention to your physical body allows you to have clarity of vision to understand your Purpose, and then the energy to achieve results - your destiny realized. This program also provides tools for you to detoxify your environmental energy (Sanctify your Surroundings). It can help you cultivate a mindset and lifestyle of sustainability - allowing you to minimize your individual toxic load and \"footprint,\" while maximizing your own health and sense of joy.

In July 1946, the World Health Organization (WHO) wrote in its constitution that: \"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.\" It's time to make this ideal a reality. The Seven-Day PWR Detox can be the start to a whole new way of being for you. Take this bridge to health and personal sustainability. Start living a more vibrant life today!

Seven-Day PWR Detox: Cleanse Your Body, Mind & Spirit While Living Your Daily Life can help jumpstart your transformation. Here's a taste from the book: On Dr. Terri Kennedy's Personal Story... I used to live a very toxic life. As Vice President at a major media company, I spent hours breathing stale office air and eating processed take-out food. My relationships had become stagnant and my thinking cloudy. I found myself sleeping less and less each night. One day I work up and realized I had lost twenty pounds in a two-week period. My body was shutting down. I ended up in the hospital for ten days almost dying. I had been a vegetarian for fifteen years and had never been sick before that day. I had actually grown up in a very healthy household with an industrial wheatgrass juicer. We even made our own yogurt! However, even though I knew what to do intellectually, I was obviously not doing it anymore on a consistent basis. The doctor diagnosed me with Crohn's disease - a severe digestive disorder. My mother, who has been a proponent of holistic health since the early 1970s, helped to heal me through integrative nutrition and a more holistic way of living. She brought me back to myself - physically, mentally and spiritually. Now, I help others do the same. On Why To Detox... Your body does the best job of rebuilding it can with the raw materials you feed it. If you improve the raw materials, regeneration is improved. However, lack of the proper inputs over time can lead to damaged cells and disease. Unfortunately, we often break down the body's defense mechanisms through lifestyle habits such as highly processed/low-fiber diets, minimal exercise, lack of sleep, and poor stress management. In addition, we poison our bodies by choice with potent pollutants such as caffeine, alcohol and nicotine. Even the way you breathe affects your health. Layer stress on top of all of that and we have a recipe for disease. Here are 8 \"In-Toxic-ating\" Habits to avoid, or at least, minimize: 1. Eating S.A.D. Food 2. A Sedentary Lifestyle 3. Lack of Sleep 4. Chronic Stress 5. Shallow Breathing 6. Drinking Caffeine 7. Excess Alcohol 8. Exposure to Nicotine On Yoga... When I was healing from Crohn's disease, yoga became my foundation and was an adjunct to my spiritual faith. It brought me back to myself and taught me that healing is really about self-awareness. Living the toxic fast-paced life, I had become very disconnected with myself - I was far from my center and my Source. The yoga practice led me back to stillness, which is critical to any type of self-reflection... Studies have shown that practicing yoga activities the parasympathetic nervous system in the body. This system lowers the heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure levels. Levels of cortisol - the hormone secreted by the adrenal glands in response to stress - also drop... The yoga detox poses (in the book) can improve circulation, digestion and elimination, as well as reduce tension and excess fat. On Recipes... This is the fun part - the taste testing! Included is a range of recipes you can choose from to make your customized menus... If you don't usually cook, don't get stressed out. Choose a few items to sample and stick to that. Simplicity is actually best. If you get overwhelmed, you can always take advantage of the suggested convenience options... If you do cook, then use these recipes as a jumping off point.
