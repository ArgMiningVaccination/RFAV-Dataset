Now, complementary and alternative medicine originated from China is gradually accepted by the world because of its unique treatment principles and relatively safe treatment methods. However, at present, there is still a lack of more definitive clinical application evidence for the treatment of gastroparesis with complementary and alternative medicine to confirm the safety and efficacy of complementary and alternative medicine in the treatment of gastroparesis caused by various causes. More comprehensive and stronger evidence-based medicine evidence is needed. Methods: We will retrieve literatures using Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library database, Web of science, CNKI, VIP, CBM, and WanFang. We will look for RCTs or CCTs on the use of complementary and alternative medicine in the treatment of gastroparesis, and extract relevant data into the excel sheet. The whole retrieval and data extraction process were carried out by 2 researchers independently. Then we will use meta-analysis to make statistical analysis of all the results and make a systematic review of all the included literatures. Results: All results and safety data were analyzed for a comprehensive evaluation and/or descriptive analysis of the efficacy and safety of complementary and alternative therapies for gastroparesis. Conclusion: This study will provide more comprehensive clinical evidence for the treatment of gastroparesis with complementary and alternative therapies. Registration: The research has been registered and approved on the INPLASY.COM website. The registration number is INPLASY2020100033.
