Naturopathic medicine is a holistic medicine that blends modern scientific knowledge with traditional and natural forms of medicine. The philosophy of naturopathic medicine is to identify and treat the root cause of symptoms to help resolve them. We use natural therapies and customize a treatment plan that is unique to your needs, preferences and health history. Naturopathic medicine also aims to educate patients about the cause of symptoms to prevent them from recurring. - Clinical Nutrition - Botanical Medicine - Acupuncture & Traditional Chinese Medicine - Homeopathy - Lifestyle Counseling In BC, Naturopathic Doctors are licensed as primary care doctors by the College of Naturopathic Physicians of BC. They are trained as general practitioners in complementary medicine and are required to do at least 3 years of post secondary education followed by a 4 year naturopathic medical degree from an accredited school. Dr. Svendsen also has additional certifications in acupuncture, IV therapy, and neural therapy. Learn more about Dr. Svendsen here: [https://www.drsvendsen.com/](https://www.drsvendsen.com/) What to Expect The first visit is approximately an hour long to allow for a comprehensive review of your health history, medications and supplements, recent laboratory tests (if available) and a partial physical exam. Dr. Svendsen may begin treatment on the first visit, or may recommend additional testing be done before starting a treatment plan. Many extended healthcare plans have some coverage for naturopathic medicine and acupuncture visits. Some will also cover certain tests, such as food allergy testing. Supplements are rarely covered. Always check with your extended healthcare provider to find out the specifics of your plan. - Common Conditions Treated - Digestive concerns: food sensitivities, constipation, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colitis - Menstrual concerns: PMS, painful periods, irregular periods, heavy periods, fibroids, hormonal imbalances - Allergies, eczema, and asthma - Fatigue - Insomnia - Anxiety and depression - Thyroid conditions - Preconception care and fertility optimization - Naturopathic approaches to pre and postnatal care: labor prep and prebirth acupuncture, postpartum depression, recurrent miscarriage - Children's health: digestive concerns, ear infections, food sensitivities, food introduction, poor immunity, skin conditions, well-child check ups, vaccination consults - Menopausal symptoms - Detoxification - Poor immune function - High blood pressure - Diabetes - Rates Initial Visit: - $170 Follow Up Visits: - $75 / 30 Minutes - $105 / 45 Minutes - $115 / 60 Minutes - MSP Coverage MSP subsidizes a portion of your treatment costs if you are on the Premium Assistance Plan. Chiropractic care can be billed to MSP directly. Evoke Wellness Centre is otherwise opted out and therefore does not bill MSP directly. Full payment for the visit will be taken at the time of service. Evoke Wellness will help complete the proper forms which you can then submit to MSP. Currently MSP will cover $23.00 per treatment. If you qualify, you are entitled to 10 combined visits for all qualifying services within that calendar year. - ICBC Coverage Evoke Wellness Centre will bill ICBC directly for a portion of the treatment costs. The patient will be responsible for their portion at the time of service. Depending on the circumstances of the accident, ICBC often reimburses the patient for their portion. Please inquire with your adjustor. At your initial visit we require you to bring your care card, your adjustor's name and your claim number. - Extended Health Care Coverage The majority of extended health care plans cover Chiropractic, Naturopathic, and Registered Massage Therapy treatments. If you have an extended health care plan you must check with them directly to find out if they offer reimbursement for services. Evoke Wellness Centre does not bill extended health care plans directly. Full payment for your treatment will be taken at the time of service. You will be issued receipts which you can then submit to your extended health care company for reimbursement. Dr. Svendsen always has time to listen to my health concerns, puts me at ease and has advice and natural products to deal with my symptoms. A warm, welcoming atmosphere is what you find as you walk through the door. The decor with subdued lighting, art work and the fixings for a cup of tea put you at ease. The staff all have a friendly greeting when they see you. I have and will continue to recommend Dr. Svendsen and the Evoke Wellness Centre to friends. "}
