If this resonates with you, read on... What is a Mind/Body/Soul Healing Session? Mind/Body/Soul Healing sessions are a unique approach to healing, transformation, insight and wellness. I bring my skills, experience and tools as a certified Transformational Life Coach, Curandera, Shamanic Practitioner and Reiki Master to intuitively help you on all levels: somatically, emotionally, mentally (conscious or unconscious), spiritually and energetically. These sessions include core elements of each healing modality, meaning that in one session you will receive: Life Coaching & Spiritual Counseling Shamanic Healing Reiki Energy Healing Treatment If we decide to work together for a longer period of time, the nature of these sessions may change. Subsequent sessions might fluctuate and focus on one or two of these healing modalities at a time. We will decide the best approach together. I approach each session individually and uniquely - this is only to give a general idea of how we will work together. During our session, you will first express what you like to address. I will ask a series of questions to get deep on the issue(s) and uncover your inner truth and wisdom. I will then walk you through a short and gentle guided meditation with some breathwork. This will help bring us to the present moment and look at the issue(s) with more clarity. Depending on what is needed, I will perform a shamanic limpia, or energy sweep, using a sacred plant bouquet, rattle, feathers, egg and/or smudging. I might also use a White Fire. This helps clear any blocked or negative energy from your auric field and prepares you for Reiki. I will then invite you to receive a Reiki treatment. You can learn more about Reiki over [here](https://mariana-luna.com/reiki). After the Reiki treatment, we will spend some time integrating the experience and closing the space. Typical session flow More about Mind/Body/Soul Healing Sessions Initial Mind/Body/Soul Healing sessions are two hours (120 minutes) and 160\u20ac. Sessions are in-person or online. A single 120 min session can often lead to noticeable improvements and insight, inspiring positive changes in your life. However, sometimes it is necessary to work together for a longer time. Subsequent sessions can be either 120 min (at 160\u20ac) or 60 min (at 80\u20ac), depending on your needs. - Energy Exchange for a two hour (160min) integrative Mind/Body/Soul Healing Session is 160\u20ac* Follow up sessions can also be 120 minutes for 160\u20ac or 60 minutes for 80\u20ac *In ensuring my work is accessible, I offer a discount for anyone who truly needs it - just get in touch.
