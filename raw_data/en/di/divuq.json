Even though these herbs pose little or no side effect when administered by a skilled physician, it is still medicine - requiring supervision by a qualified specialist.

Herbal medicine is within the scope of natural medicine, which is the oldest, continually practiced professional medicine. \"More people have been treated with herbs and acupuncture than all systems of medicine combined.\" It is based on an individualized pattern diagnosis as well as a disease diagnosis. Your pattern is made up of signs, symptoms, emotions, temperament, and overall body composition. The written herbal prescription is designed to target the individual pattern as well as the symptom or disease. An herbal medicine prescription may include 6 to 18 different herbs. Herbal medicine is a complete system, containing physical, biological, and chemical properties. SOURCES OF HERBS The majority of herbs are derived from the plant kingdom, using the radix, rhizoma, folium, and fructus of the plant, depending on the nature of the illness. They may include the leaf, flower, twig, fruit, stem, root, tuber, rhizome, and bark. Some herbs are from animal and mineral sources. And God said, \"See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food\"; and it was so. - Genesis 1:29-30 FIND THE BEST HERBAL MEDICINE SPECIALIST Although herbal medicine is safe when prescribed by a trained and knowledgeable practitioner, it is still medicine. Patients should ask about where the practitioner was trained, how long the training was, how long he/she has been in practice, and what experience the practitioner has had in treating the patient's specific ailment. Most importantly, find out the background of the herbal medicine specialist. (e.g. experience, knowledge, years of education, years of medical excellence, good reputation, RESULTS, etc.) Ask about the qualifications first. In the state of California, the Board of Medical Quality Assurance certifies those who pass a state board qualifying examination.
