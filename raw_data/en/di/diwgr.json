The research tasks are to: - evaluate the safety of the EpiVacCorona vaccine when administered twice intramuscularly; - evaluate the reactogenicity of the EpiVacCorona vaccine when administered twice intramuscularly; - identify the development of adverse reactions to vaccine administration; - study the humoral and cellular immune responses following two doses of the EpiVacCorona vaccine. |Condition or disease||Intervention/treatment||Phase| |Covid19||Biological: EpiVacCorona (EpiVacCorona vaccine peptide prevention of COVID-19) Other: Placebo (sodium chloride bufus, solvent for the preparation of dosage forms for injection 0.9%)||Phase 1 Phase 2| The first phase of the clinical trial is an open trial. The study will enroll 14 men and women aged 18 to 30 years, inclusive, who meet the inclusion criteria and have no exclusion criteria, whose data will be used for subsequent analysis of safety and immunogenicity. The second phase of the clinical trial is a simple, blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study. The study will enroll 86 men and women aged 18 to 60 years, inclusive, who meet the inclusion criteria and have no exclusion criteria whose, the data will be used for subsequent analysis of safety and immunogenicity. If volunteers drop out of the study, they will not be replaced. |Study Type and Immunogenicity of Vaccine Based on Peptide Antigens for the Prevention of COVID-19 (EpiVacCorona), in Volunteers Aged 18-60 Years (I-II Phase)| |Actual Study Date Date :||December (An Open Study) | Group 1: 14 volunteers who will be vaccinated with the EpiVacCorona vaccine twice spaced 21 days apart, intramuscularly, at a dose of 0.5 ml | Biological: EpiVacCorona (EpiVacCorona vaccine based on peptide antigens for the prevention of COVID-19) | EpiVacCorona vaccine is intended to prevent COVID-19.
