THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF SPOKANE COUNTY, WASHINGTON ORDAINS as follows: Section 1. Recitals and Findings . 1.1 Spokane County (the \"County\") is a political subdivision duly organized and existing under the Constitution and laws of Washington State. The County operates and maintains a system of solid waste handling as authorized by the Constitution and laws of the State, including RCW 36.58.040. 1.2 In accordance with chapter 70.95 RCW, the County adopted and maintains a Spokane County Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan (the \"SCCSWMP\") to, in part, control the disposal of solid waste generated and collected within the County. The County is in the process of updating the SCCSWMP. This ordinance and the SCCSWMP apply to the unincorporated County and the jurisdictions participating in the SCCSWMP and County System under chapter 70.95 RCW. 1.3 Under the authority of chapter 36.58 RCW, the County established by Ordinance No. 85-0395, as subsequently amended by other ordinances (the \"Ordinance\"), a comprehensive County-wide system of solid waste disposal for all solid waste generated in unincorporated areas of the County (the \"System\"). The Ordinance, and Spokane County Code (\"SCC\"), designates the System as the exclusive solid waste disposal site and facility for all solid waste collected in the County's unincorporated areas (\"Flow Control\"). 1.4 In 1989, the County and the City of Spokane (the \"City\") entered into an \"Amended and Restated Interlocal Agreement between the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington Spokane Regional Solid Waste Management System\" (the \"1989 Interlocal -1- 51402591.6 Agreement\") to create the Spokane Regional Solid Waste System (the \"Spokane Regional System\"). Consistent with the 1989 Interlocal Agreement, the County adopted Ordinance No. 88-1267, designating the Spokane Regional System for solid waste disposal for all solid waste generated in unincorporated areas of the County. 1.5 The City administered the Spokane Regional System. The Spokane Regional System's facilities included four primary facilities: a transfer station in Spokane Valley (the \"Valley Transfer Station\"), a transfer station in unincorporated north Spokane County (the \"North County Transfer Station\"), a waste- to-energy facility (the \"WTE Facility\")(together the transfer stations and WTE are jointly referred to as the \"Transfer Stations\"), and the Northside Landfill. Those facilities are currently operated and owned by the City. 1.6 The County has now entered into an \"Interlocal Agreement between the City of Spokane and Spokane County Re garding Transfer and Disposal of Solid Waste\" Agreement as of November 16, 2014; 1.6.2 provides for the transfer of ownership on November 17, 2014 of t he Transfer Stations from the City to the County; 1.6.3 establishes the terms and conditions for the delivery and disposal of all solid waste collected in the County at the Transfer Stations to the WTE Facility for disposal for a term of seven (7) years; and 1.6.4 recognizes the \"County Regional Solid Waste System\" or the \"County Regional System.\" Subject to limitations, the County may terminate the City/County Interlocal Agreement after an initial three (3) years. 1.7 The Board finds that the integrity of the County Regional System and its effective administration are essential to promote the health, safety and general welfare of County residents. Accordingly, consistent with the City/County Interlocal Agreement, state law and the SCC, the Board finds it necessary to amend the Ordinance and the SCC to designate the County Regional System as the System. The Board further finds that additional monitoring and enforcement provisions are necessary to enforce Flow Control within the County to ensure effective administration of the System. Section 2.
