The authors would like to thank Shona Hilton and Kate Hunt ( Institute of Health and Wellbeing , University of Glasgow) for their support with the data on UK news cover- age during the A/H1N1 outbreak. We also appreciate the support of Tyra Grove Krause and Julita Gil Cueasta (Infectious Diseases Epidemiology Department, Stat- ens Serum Institu et) regarding the data on the number of confirmed A/H1N1 deaths as well as the number of vaccines administered in Denmark during the A/H1N1 pan- demic. Further, we would like to Jorge (National Centre for Epidemiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III) for informa tion on the number of confirmed A/H1N1 cases and deaths in Spain during the A/H1N1 pandemic. Ole W ichmann and his team (Division Immunization, Robert Koch -Institute) also provided valuable data on the vaccine uptake and the intention to get vaccinated amon g survey participants in Germany, which we highly appreciate. 3 Executive summary In March/Ap ril 2009, a new influenza A virus emerged, causi ng the first pandemic of the 21st century. The first influenza A/H1N1 infections were reported in Mexico and shortly after, occurred in the US, before spreading globally eventually affecting all European countries in 2009. As with all new rapidly emerging outbreaks, information on the transmission dynamics, incubation period, virulence and other characteristics of the influenza A/H1N1 virus were initially missing. It however, became clear at an early stage that the outbreak met the criteria to become a pandemic and the countries started to take response measures. Some severe influenza A/H1N1 infections, partially with fa tal outcome, had been reported in previously healthy young persons from Mexico City, which increased apprehension in an already uncertain situation. During the pandemic, the media reported on official statements, but also on various aspects such as severe disease courses, fatal outcomes as well as vaccine safety in the context of the changing dynamics of the pandemic. These dynamics of the influenza A/H1N1 transmission in combination with the enormous amounts of varying media messages and official national and international recommendations influenced the perceptions, beliefs and finally peoples' behavior during the pandemic. In order to increase the acceptance of large -scale response measures such as vaccination among at-risk groups and the general public, communication messages have to take into account factors that influence human behavior. Therefore, one of the aims of the Ecom@EU project is to explore the time -dependent interplay between the changing influenza A/H1N1 epidemiology, initiated pandemic management measures, media attention, risk perception and public health behaviour throughout the pandemic. A time series analysis explores the interaction of what actually happened (epidemic curves), how the countrie s responded (public health measures), what was recommended (official recommendations), media attention (number of media messages released) and finally how people perceived the risk and reacted (vaccination uptake) along the timeline of the pandemic . The re sults of this analysis give valuable insight into the time -dependent influence of these factors and what 4 should be taken into consideration when formulating risk communication messages in uncertain situations. To obtain pandemic influenza A/H1N1 surveilla nce data and information on the national pandemic control measures initiated in five selected European countries, namely Germany, the U nited Kingdom , Spain, the Czech Republic and Denmark, a comprehensive literature search of scientific as well as grey lit erature was carried out and websites of national health authorities and international health agencies were searched. In addition, national health authorities were contacted for information that could not be retrieved through the search. The data collected were used to draw epidemic and media curves for each of the countries. The media attention was analysed for the time period of April 1st 2009 to March 31st 2010 (March 2009 to February 2010 for UK). Media attention data for Germany, Spain and the Czech Re public were obtained from the Switzerland -based media research institute Media Tenor. Data on media attention in the UK was retrieved from the data of Hilton and Hunt's (2011) article on UK news coverage, and for D enmark from a search in LexisNexis. To assess the risk perception of the different populations and their potentially protective behaviour (e.g. vaccination uptake), several national and European surveys were considered. The Robert Koch -Institute and the States Serum Institute were contacted for fu rther information on vaccination uptake in Germany and Denmark. The public health measures and recommendations from the literature search, the number of influenza A/H1N1 associated media stories from the media analysis and information on risk perception an d vaccination coverage were plotted using the epidemic curves as a timeline. Germany, the UK, Spain, the Czech Republic and Denmark were considerably affected by influenza A/H1N1 and showed different pandemic profiles during the 2009 pandemic. Due to differences in the surveillance systems, the number of influenza A/H1N1 cases and deaths cannot be compared between the countries. However, this was not the aim of the present report, but rather, to assess similarities and differences in the trends. In general, all included countries experienced two waves of the influenza A/H1N1 virus during the pandemic in 2009/2010. The first wave occurred around week 30, 2009 and the 5 number o f cases remained at a lower level over summer. In autumn/winter 2009, Germany, Spain, the Czech Republic and Denmark experienced a major wave of influenza A/H1N1 cases, whereas the UK saw its major wave already in spring 2009 and a smaller wave in autumn/w inter. Compared to the other countries, the UK and Spain were affected early by the influenza A/H1N1 virus in terms of reported cases and deaths. Throughout the pandemic, the highest infection rates were observed in children and young people. Generally, the virus caused a mild illness and a more severe disease was especially experienced by persons with underlying health conditions . The initial control strategies focused on limiting transmission of the virus or delaying the spread. In order to inform the g eneral public on the pandemic virus and personal protective measures, German y, the UK, Spain, the Czech Republic and Denmark developed extensive information material at an early stage of the pandemic. The campaigns provided basic knowledge of hygiene and p ersonal protective measures against infection. Further, the national authorities of all included countries published tailored information for healthcare professionals on the treatment of cases and preventive measures. In late October, Germany and the UK st arted their vaccination program. Denmark started vaccination in the beginning of November, Spain in mid -November and the Czech Republic in the end of November 2009 . The countries responded to and changed recommendations in response to available evidence on the characteristics of the virus and the pandemic vaccines. The vaccination campaigns that went alongside the vaccination programs in Germany, the UK and Spain informed the general public on the aspects of the programs. In addition, the UK and Germany is sued tailored information for at -risk groups. Furthermore, information for healthcare professionals was published in all five countries to inform them on the specific pandemic vaccines and on aspects for vaccine administration. Despite the different data c ollection methods (see above), the media attention defined as the number of influenza A/H1N1 associated media stories was highest in week 18 in all of the included countries , when the WHO declar ed pandemic phase four and five. Apart from the 6 UK and Spain, this was considerably before influenza A/H1N1 began to spread within the countries. Thereafter, the media attention curve only showed smaller peaks, which may be related to the first death in the country as well as to the discussion of vaccination priority groups. For Spain and Germany, data derived from Google Flu Trends was included in the analysis. The frequency of influenza -related web search queries well reflected the epidemic curve in both countries. The risk of personally contracting an influenza A/H1N1 infection was perceived as rather low by participants in the Eurobarometer survey from all of the included countries. The intention to get vaccinated against influenza A/H1N 1 and the actual vaccine uptake was also rather low. When asked for a trusted source of information, most of the respondents from the included countries named health professionals. Although a lot of information on the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus, personal protective measures and the pandemic vaccine has been published, vaccina tion goals were mostly not met (especially among risk -groups such as pregnant women, healthcare workers and persons with underlying diseases) and the uptake of recommended behavior during the pandemic was low. The analysis shows that the main vaccination uptake in all the study countries occurred within a short period of around four weeks after the start of vaccination. This short time - span could be regarded as the window of opportunity during which concerted efforts of the state ministries, of public heal th institutes and especially of health professionals , who are regarded as the most trusted source of information accord ing to the Eurobarometer survey, should be under taken. Further, the high media attention very early in the pandemic should be used to inf orm the population about the disease, the importance of adopting protective behavior such as getting vaccinated and very important - reliable sources of information during the pandemic . As the analysis of Google Flu Trends data show s, the information seeki ng of the people increased with the increasing number of influenza A/H1N1 cases in the country. Therefore, communication channels such as Google or Twitter may be useful for addr essing specific target -groups in order to provide reliable and up-to-date information. 7 Several improvements have been identified regarding the vaccination and information campaigns, but still, more work is needed to see how recommendations can be effectively translated into higher vaccination coverage and behavior change. This s hould also take into account the influence of varying media messages, but also the news reporting in and from other countries about potentially spreading diseases. 8 Content EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ................................ ................................ ................... 3 1 INTRODUCTION project ................................ 23 2 METHODS literature search ................................ ................................ ................................ . 24 2.2 Literature search on official recommendations ................................ ................................ .. 27 2.3 A/H1N1 related communication in the media ................................ ................................ ..... 27 2.4 Epidemic curves and time series ................................ ............ 30 3 human 53 The United Kingdom ................................

the pandemic A/H1N1 virus In March/ April 2009 , a new influenza A/H1N1 virus emerged causing the first pandemic of the 21st century. The pandemic started in Veracruz, Mexico where an outbreak of influenza - like illness was recorded in early April (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . A few day s later , other outbrea ks of influenza -like illness were reported in several parts of Mexico. Analysis of samples detected an Influenza A virus , but it was not possible to identify the subtype (World Health Organization, 2011) . By 23 April , 120 confirme d cases of respiratory illness due to influenza and 20 deaths ha d been reported in Mexico (Dacey et al ., 2010) . The situation was of concern becau se especially young people and previously healthy people experienced severe disease (World Health Organization, 2011) . In mid -April, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified the swine influenza A/H1N1 virus from a sample of two children with respiratory illness in southern California in the USA . CDC stated that the virus contained a gene segment that had not yet been found in human s or swine and raised concern that this new strain of swine influenza A/H1N1 virus differs from human influenza A/H1N1 viruses . This would imply that a large proportio n of people might not be immune to this new strain of swine influenza A/H1N1 and that the seasonal influenza vaccine would not protect from contracting the virus (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009) . Further virological analyses confirmed that the virus isolates from Mexican patients were genetically identical to the new strain of swine influenz a A/H1N1 virus discovered in California (World Health Organization, 2009b) . Molecular analyses revealed that the virus was a product of reassortment. In this process , genetic material of various virus subtypes admixes and results in a new virus . This biological proc ess occurs when one organism is infected with two different influenza viruses at the same time. Swine are an ideal species for this process as they are susceptible to infection by both bird and human influenza viruses. The new swine influenza A/H1N1 virus was most likely derived from the US triple 18 reassortment swine influenza virus and a Eurasia n H1N1 swine influenza lineage (Schaberg & Burger, 2010) . The swine triple reassortment was first discovered in 1998. It was derived from a swine influenza v irus lineage, an avian influenza virus and a human Influenza A/H3N2 lineage. It is not clear when exactly the reassortment took place that produced the new swine influenza A/H1N1 (Bush, 2011) . Figure 1 illustrates the described evolution of the ne w swine influenza A/H1N1 virus. Figure 1: Evolution of the new swine influenza A/H1N1 virus (Bush, 2011; modified by author) Global situation The virus started to spread globally and by 28 April seven countries (Mexico, USA, C anada, Israel, New Zealand, Spain and the UK) reported confirmed cases of swine influ enza A/H1N1 (World Health Organization, 2011) . On 29 April, WHO raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 5 and advised all countries to activate their pandemic preparedness and response plans (World Health Organization, 2009e) . Although only a few coun tries were affected at this stage, Phase 5 was a signal that a pandemi c was coming up and human to 1998 Swine triple reassortment1968 Reassortment 1930 First classic\" swine Human seasonal H3N2Several reassortments over time 1979 H1N1 19 human spread of the virus into at least two countri es of one WHO region was evident (World Health Organization, 2012) . The number of affected countries increased stead ily and by 9 June, 73 countries worldwide had reported 26.563 lab oratory confirmed cases to WHO (World Health Organization, 2011) . On 11 June, the WHO raised the level of influenza pandem ic alert to phase 6 , declaring a pandemic (World Health Organization, 2009h) . This phase is defined by a h igh and sustained transmission in the population, in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the characteristics of Phase 5 (World Health Organization, 2012) . The severity of the pandemic was considered to be moderate by the WHO (World Health Organization, 2009i) . In order t o find a scientifically acceptable name for the virus, the WHO organi zed a teleconference with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) on 15 June . The participants agreed to name the virus \"pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus \" (World Health Organization, 2011) . The pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus (here after referred to as pandemic A/H1N1 virus ) continued to spread globally and became the predominant circulating influenza virus (World Health Organization, 2009m) . By October, the over all number of cases started to decline , but some regions of the world still experienced sustained transmission (Sekkides, 2010) . An assessment of the global situation in August 2010 indicated that the levels and patterns of pandemic A/H1N1 transmission showed seasonal patterns of transmission. Therefore , on 10 August 2010 the WHO announced that the pandemic was over (World Health Organization, 2010c) . By then, more than 214 countries and overseas territories have reported confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases and nearly 18.500 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 related deaths have been recorded (World Health Organization, 2010b) . It is possible, that the number of deaths from pandemic A/H1N1 infection is underestimated because the WHO\u00b4s number considers only deaths of patients in whom pandemic A/H1N1 infection was 20 laboratory con firmed. Thus, many deaths may have been either not recognized or not reported . Differences between pandemic A/H1N1 and seasonal influenza The clinical p resentation of a pandemic A/H1N1 infection was similar to a seasonal influenza infection. Common symptoms were fever, cough, sore throat, body aches and headache. Additionally, patients with pandemic A/H1N1 infection reported vomiting and diarrhea (Robert Ko ch-Institut e, 2009a) . Most cases experienced mild illness. Patients experiencing severe dis ease had similar risk factors as for seasonal influenza complications (Lou ie et al ., 2009; Nicoll & Coulombier, 2009) . A significant difference between pandemic A/H1N1 and seasonal influenza was that mostly younger age groups were affected . Several studies observed that many people aged 65 years were immune most likely due to exposure to a similar influenza virus that ha d been circulating before the mid -1950s (Donaldson et al. , 2009; Hardelid et al. , 2010) . The case fatality ratio was highest in pers ons aged 65 years or over, a lthough the lowest incidence rate was observed in this age group. This means that individuals aged 65 years or over were less likely to contract a pandemic A/H1N1 infection than younger a ge groups, but if they contracted the virus , they were more likely to have a severe or fatal outcome . A study on the epidemiology of 308 fatal cases in England by Pebody et al. (2010 ) reported a case fatality ratio of nine per 1.000 clinical cases for the 65 years age group compared to a case fatality ratio of 0.4 per 1.000 clinical cases for those aged six months to 64 years . Underlying risk factors for severe disease were obser ved in 77% of the 308 fatal cases. The overall case fatality rate was estimated to be 0.4 per 1.000 clinical cases. A similar finding has been reported earlier by Donaldson et al. (2009) . This study also showed that the mortality in this pandemic was lower than observed in previous pandemics. A considerable proportion of fatal outcomes occurred in younger age groups (Department of Health, 2010d; Larrauri C\u00e1mara, & Burger, 2010) . Nearly 80% of fatal cases reported to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) occur red in those under 65 years of age (Amato - Gauci et al. , 2010) . The minority of fatal cases occurred in previously healthy people. The relative risk for fatal outcome was esp ecially high for those with underlying chronic conditions . Donaldson et al. (2009) observed a nine times greater risk of dying from pandemic A/H1N1 for p eople in one of the risk groups eligible for vaccination in the UK. Member s of an at -risk group were people with chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, chronic neurological disease, immunosuppressi on, diabetes mellitus and pregnant women (Department of Health, 2009g; Hine, 2010) . The findings from Pedbody et al. (2010) showed that pandemic A/H1N1 patients with chronic neurological disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic liver disease and immunosuppression were the most vulnerable group for fatal outcome . This may explain the high case fatality rate in the older age groups among whom the prevalence of underlying risk conditions is likely to be high. In addition, pregnancy has also been revealed to be a risk factor. Similar findings on risk factors for severe disease or death we re published in reports from other countries (Louie et al. , 2009; Santa -Olalla Peralta, - Herrero, et al. , 2010) . Although characteristics of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus having an impact on the size, speed and seriousness of a pandemic (like spectrum of disease , reproduction rate, immunity, case fatali ty rate, age distribution, etc. ) were still missing when the virus emerged (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009g) , it became clear at an early stage that it met the criteria for a pandemic strain1 (Amato -Gauci et al. , 2010) and countries started to take response measures . 1 These criteria are: a new influenza A virus subtype genetically different from circulating human influenza A viruses, able to cause disease in humans and able to spread easily from one person to another (World Health Org anization, 2005) 22 1.1 The Ecom@EU project Effective measures to counter the impact of such major epidemic outbreaks include large - scale vaccination and distribution of antiviral therapy. Although scientific knowledge and technical ability to take effective response measures exist , there may still be potential for improvement in the governments' and health authorities' communicat ion regarding the need for such large -scale measures in a reli able way in order to increase the acceptance of these measures among the general public and at -risk groups . In order t o bridge this gap, the project \"Effective Commun ication in Outbreak Management: Development of an evidence -based tool for Europe (Ecom@EU )\" has been launched in March 2012. It combines state-of-the- art knowledge in epidemiology, media analysis, social marketing, risk perception, and discrete choice experiments in order to develop an evidence -based behavioral and communication package that ca n be applied by health professionals and health agencies throughout Europe in case of major epidemic outbreaks (Ecom@EU Study Group, 2011) . The different characteristics of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic influenza influence d people's perception on the risk of contracting the virus and the fear of the virus. In addition, the enormous amounts of varying media messages and official recommendations along with conflicting media messages on vaccine safety influenced people's perce ptions, beliefs and finally people's behavior during the pandemic (Feufel, Antes, & Gigerenzer, 2010) . In order to increase the acceptance of large -scale response measures among the gene ral public and at-risk groups, communication messages have to take into account the se factors that influence human behavior . Therefore, one of the aims of the E com@EU project is to assess the influence of the A/H1N1 epidemiology, the varying pattern of ris k communication, and the changing official recommendations on human protective behavior during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The dynamics and interactions of these factors are explored in a time series analysis. For this analysis, epidemic curves of the 2009 A /H1N1 pandemic in selected EU countries are drawn. These epidemic curves provide i nformation on the pattern of disease spread and serve as a timeline along which data on official (national and international) public health and health behavior recommendations, the A/H1N1 associated media stories as well 23 as data on public behavior during the pandemic are plotted . The results of this ana lysis will provide valuable information about the time dependent influence s of the described factors and what should be considered when formulating uncertain risk communication messages (Ecom@EU Study Group, 2011) . 1.2 Purpose of this report This report contributes to the Ecom@EU project by exploring the dynamics of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic in, Germany, the UK, Spain , Czech Republic and Denmark . These countries were chosen to assess the pandemic in different regions of Europe, including at least one country from Southern Europe, Northern Europe and Eastern Europe. Initially, the UK and Spain were countries most affected by the pandemic in Europe but as the pandemic started to spread across Europe, Germany also reported significant numbers of cases (Nicoll & Coulombier, 2009) Therefore, the UK was also included in the analysis. This report presents the progress of the pandemic in the five countries and gives a systematically documented chronological overview of public health measures taken and official recommendations released during the pandemic in order to reduce the impact of the pandemic. A time series analysis explores the interaction of what actually happened (epidemic curves), how the countries responded (public health measures), what the people were recommended (official recommendations) and how people perceived the risk and reacted accordingly (vaccination uptake) along the timeline of the pandemic . 24 2 Methods 2.1 Systematic literature search In order t o obtain pandemic A/H1N1 surveillance data for the UK , Germany, Spain , Denmark and Czech Republic a systematic literature search was accomplished using Medline and Google Scholar. Medline was the main source. The search terms used in Medline were H1N1, epidemiology, populat ion surveillance, incidence, prevalence and Europe. Two searches were conducted. The first search used the combination H1N1 AND (epidemiology OR population surveillance) AND Europe. The second search had the search query H1N1 AND (prevalence OR incidence) AND Europe. The limits used were articles published from 2009 to 2013 , articles i n English and German. A text words search for H1N1 was employed t o retrieve recent papers that are included in Medline , but are not yet indexed and therefore have no assigned MeSH terms . Table 1shows the search strategy in Medline. Table 1: Search strategy in Medline Search Term Combination OR Combination AND Search 1 Search 2 H1N1 [TW]\u00b9 X X Epidemiology [Me SH]\u00b2 X X Population [MeSH] Prevalence SH] X X \u00b9 [tw]: Search in title, abstract, other abstract, MeSH terms, MeSH Subheadings, Publication Types, Substance Names, Personal Name as Subject, Corporate Author, Secondary Source, and Other Terms. \u00b2 [MeS h]: Medical Subject Heading In Google Scholar , a brief search was conducted; therefore the \"allintitle\" -operator was employed for each search. Except for Europe, the same search terms as for the Medline 25 search were used. Two search terms were combined per search using the Boolean function \"AND\" . Same as in Medline, only articles published from 2009 to 201 3 were considered . Table 2 illustrates the search strategy in Google Scholar. Table 2: Search strategy in Google Scholar Search Term Combination AND Search 1 Search 2 Search 3 Search 4 H1N1 X X X X Epidemiology X Population surveillance X Prevalence X Incidence X Note: For each search the allintitle:\" - operator was used. It only returns results that include your search term in the document's title. For literature extraction the following inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed. Inclusion criteria: Articl es with relation to the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. Articles on epidemiological characteristics of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. Articles with relation to the general population. Articles that deal with the UK , German y, Spain , Denmark or Czech Republic . Exclusion c riteria: Articles that did not deal with the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. Articles that did not report epidemiological characteristics of the pandemic. Articles on vaccination or antiviral drugs. Articles on microbiological characteristics of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus. Articles with relation to specific risk groups only (e.g. young children, pregnant women) 26 Articles in other languages (other than English or German). Altogethe r, the conducted search in Medline and Google Scholar resulted in 285 articles. First, a selection was made based on the title whereby 207 articles were excluded. The second selection was based on the abstract. After the abstract screening another 31 art icles were excluded. Finally, 47 articles on pandemic A/H1N1 surveillance data were found . Figure 2 shows this selection process . Figure 2: Selection process 27 In addition to the systematic literature search grey literature and we bsites of national health authorities (Robert Koch -Institut e, Health Protection Agency, Spanish Ministry of Health and Social Policy , Statens Serum Institut e and the Czech Ministry of Health ) and international health agencies (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, World Health Organization) were searched to retrieve pandemic A/H1N1 surveillance data. To obtain further epidemiological data on the numb er of new A/H1N1 cases per we ek, the repor ted number of deaths and vaccine uptake in Spain , Germany and Denmark, the Ministerio de Sanidad, Servicios Sociales e Igualdad , the Robert Koch -Institute and the States Serum Institut e were contacted . 2.2 Literature s earch on official recommenda tions A literature search on public health measures taken and official health behavior recommendations released during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was conducted considering the official websites of national health authorities, but also grey literature . Additional ly, recommendations released by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) , the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) were included . 2.3 A/H1N1 related communication in the media The media and so cial media content analysis of the A/H1N1 pandemic is part of WP2 of the Ecom@EU project, in which the Department of Communication Science at VU University Amsterdam is involved. Their cooperating company, the Switzerland -based media research institute Media Tenor, conduct ed a retrospective content media analysis of the 2 009/2010 A/H1N1 pandemic from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 in Germany, Czech Republic and Spain. Opinions and risk perception were the main aspects in order to analyze how the A/H1N1 pande mic was portrayed in the media. 28 For the analysis of news reporting, the search terms \"H1N1\", \"Swine flu\" and \"new virus\" were used in the respective language s. In the analysis, the main evening news show (assessed by human coders) as well as the mainstream newspapers (assessed through automated content analysis ) of the respective country were considered. Table 3 shows the newspapers and main news show included in the analysis for Czech Republic, Germany and Spain. All news items were retrieved, scanned for relevance and included if they referred primarily to H1N1, swine flu or swine flu vaccination. News stories were defined as primarily referring to H1N1 if the topic took up either (a) the greatest part, or (b) at least half of the news item (more than any other issue), or (c) was mentioned in the headline or (d) depicted in an illustration. Table 3: TV news shows and newspapers included in media analysis by country TV Print Weeklies Czech Republic CTV Udalosti Lidove Noviny Respekt Telediario El Pais Tiempo (Internet) 20 minutos Due to quality issues in the coding process, only the quantitative results of Media Tenor's analysis are used for this report. The number of A/H1N1 associated media stories per calendar week were combined for the three media forms (daily and weekly newspaper, TV news show) and plotted along the timeline of the epidemic curve for Germany, Czech Republic and Spain. 29 The content media analysis could not be performed by Media Tenor for Denmark. Hence, an alternative search was conducted in LexisNexis . The database was searched for all articles in the Dani sh newsp apers \"Politiken\" and \"Politi ken weekly\" published from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 using the search terms \"H1N1\" and \"svineinfluenza\". It was assessed, whether the article mainly dealt with A/H1N1. The number of articles primarily focusing on A/H1N1 per calendar week was calculated and plotted along the timeline of the epidemic curve. Each article was included in this analysis only once, independently of how ofte n this article has been published2. For the UK, the number of A/H1N1 associated media stories was derived from the article \"UK newspapers' representations of the 2009/10 outbreak of swine flu: one health scare not over-hyped by the media?\" by Hilton, 2011. This article describes an analysis of UK newsprint coverage of A/H1N1 pandemic from 1 March 2009 to 28 February 2010 considering eight newspapers with high circulation figures and various readership profiles. The articles during the time period were i dentified through a search in LexisNexis with the search terms \"swine flu\" or \"H1N1\" in \"All text\". All articles mainly related to A/H1N1 (defined as the primary focus and more than 50% of the article) and published in the News, Comment, Feature, Business, City, Sport, Travel or Home, were included. This resulted in 2374 articles. The data set with these 2374 articles could be used for our analysis thanks to the authors' (Hilton&Hunt) permission and contribution . For the analysis, a subsample of Hiltons and Hunts sample was taken considering the newspapers' circulation number as well as the political spectrum covered. Further, a similar approach to Media Tenor was chosen using two serious newspapers, one middle -market tabloid and one tabloid. Therefore, T he Daily 2 \"Politiken weekly\" is a newspaper which consists of the main articles collected over one week out of \"Politiken\". Therefore, the main articles may be published twice, once in \"Politiken\" and again in \"Politiken weekly\". 30 Telegraph (serious, conservative/supportive of Tories), The Guardian (serious, liberal, left - wing/supportive of Labour), The Daily Mail & Mail on Sunday (middle -market tabloid) and The Sun (tabloid) were included. The same as for Denmark, the numb er of articles per calendar week was calculated and plotted along the timeline of the epidemic curve. For Spain as well as for Germany, further i nformation derived from Google Flu Tr ends were included in the analysis. Google Flu T rends uses influenza -related online web search queries in order to monitor health -seeking behavior and to estimate the frequency of influenza -like disease in a particular area or country. In previous research, this method showed to be useful for accurately estimating the influenza -like illness prevalence in various regions in the United States since the relative frequency of influenza -related search terms is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits of patients with influenza -like illness (Ginsberg et al 200 8). Goog le Flu T ends categorizes the frequency of influenza -related web searches into minimal, low, moderate, frequent and very frequent on a weekly scale and plots them over a one -year time period (July to June). These graphs always inclu de one reference curve, s o the graph used in this report compares the season 2013/2014 to the time period of the A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009/2010 . 2.4 Epidemic curves and time series analysis The information from the articles derived from the systematic literature search , the aspects from the additional search on offi cial websites of national and international health authorities as well as the data received from national health authorities were used to draw epidemic curves for the UK , Germany, Spain , Denmark and Czech Republic (see annex \"Comprehensive information on epidemic curves and key events per country\" for the epidemic curves only) . National data sources, if available, were preferred over data from European or international health authorities such as ECDC or WHO because of potential ly incomplete or delayed reporting to these authorities (see for example http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/H1N1/epidemiological_data/Pages/number_confirme d_fatal_2009_pandemic_influenza_cases.aspx ). 31 The public health measures taken and official recommendations released during the 2 009 A/H1N1 pandemic are illustrated in a time series analysis using the epidemic curves as a timeline along which key data of the events and recommendations are plotted . The same approach is used for the combined number of A/H1N1 associated media stories from daily and weekly newspapers as well as TV news shows. Further data on human behavior such as vaccination uptake rates , if available, were also assessed over time and considered in the analysis. For the Figures 3,5 ,6,8 and 9 the scales for the reported number of confirmed A/H1N1 cases (on the vertical left side of each figure) and the number of confirmed A/H1N1 related deaths and A/H1N1 relat ed media messages (on the vertical right side of each figure) were individu ally chosen to optimally display the progress of the A/H1N1 pandemic along with key events in each study country. For each of the included countries, epidemiology and progress of the pandemic, surveillance, pandemic management strategy , vaccination strat egy and communication as well as communication in the media is described in detail in the following section ( 3 Results ). Further, in order to give an in -depth description of the public health measures taken und official recommendations released during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic, the pandemic has been split up into five time periods , separately for each of the included countries. This was similarly done in an analysis of the response measures in the Netherlands (Stein, van Vliet, & Timen, 2011) . Each time period repre sents different stages in the progress of the pandemic and different respon se activities of Germany, the UK, Spain, Czech Republic and Denmar k: Time period 1 (01/04/2009 to 21/06/2009). This time period is characterized by the emergence of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus in Mexico and the spread of the virus to the UK, Spain, Germany, Denmark and the Czech Republic. It also describes early response strategies to contain the spread of the virus. 32 Time period 2 (22/06/2009 to 02/08/2009). Numbers of confirmed cas es increased constantly and therefore , a change in prevention and control policy from containment to mitigation took place in this time period. Time period 3 (03/08/2009 to 04/10/2009). Numbers of confirmed cases decreased during the summer. In this time p eriod , countries started to prepare the vaccination program. Time period 4 (05/10/2009 to week 30/11/2009). This time period is characterized by the autumn winter wave with high number s of confirmed cases. In this time period the UK, Germany, Spain, Denmar k and the Czech Republic started their vaccination programs and campaigns. Time period 5 (01/12/2009 to 15/04/2010). This is the post peak period. During this time period the numbers of confirmed pandemic cases started to decline constantly. Again, each time period serves as a timeline along which data on all public health measures taken and official (national and international) health behavior recommendations released during the different time periods are plotted. To structure the information of each time period, the events were allocated to the following themes: situation, surveillance, control strategy and treatment of cases, vaccination strategy and communication. For a better overview each country is presented separately. The results for t he in -depth analysis are presented in annex \"In-depth description of events and recommendations \". 3 Results The pandemic started in Veracruz, Mexico where an outbreak of influenza -like illness was recorded in early April 2009 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . A few days later several parts of Mexico reported further outbreaks of influenza -like illness. Analysis of samples detected an Influenza A virus but it was not possible to identify the subtyp e (World Health Organization, 2011) . In mid -April, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analyzed a sample from two children with respiratory illness 33 in southern California, USA and i dentified the virus as a swine influenza A/H1N1 virus (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009) . On 24 April WHO reported that virus isolate d from Mexican patients were genetically identical to the new strain of swi ne influenza A/H1N1 virus discovered in California (World Health Organization, 2009b) . On the same day ECDC published its first Threat Assessment stating that although the public health situation was still limited to Mexico and the US further vigilance was required in Europe to ensure the identification of the new virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009d) . One day later, on 25 April 2009, the first WHO Emergency Committee meeting was held. International experts came together to assess the situation in Mexico and the US and to advice the WHO Director -General, Dr. Margaret Chan, on response measures. The Committee re ported more information on the clinical presentation, epidemiology and virology of cases was needed, but concluded , that the situation was of international concern. Thus, Dr . Margret Chan declared the outbreak in Mexico and the US as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under International Health Regulations (2005) and advised all countries to intensify surveillance for influenza -like illness and respirat ory disease (World Health Organiza tion, 2009c) . On the same day, the ECDC started to publish daily situation reports in which the current epidemiological sit uation was summarized. So far, eight cases of pandemic A/H1N1 ha d been confirmed in the United States of America. In Mexico City , 854 cases of pneumonia have been reported, including 59 deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009e) . Two days later, on 27 April, the first laboratory confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases have been reported in Europe, one in Spain and two in the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009f) . Based on available data on confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases in Mexico, the USA, Canada, and reports on s uspected cases in other countries, the 34 WHO Director -General raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 4 (World Health Organization, 2009d) . While phase 3 is characterized by sporadic cases and limited human - to-human transmission of an influenza reassortant virus, p hase 4 is defined by confirmed human -to-human transmission of an influenza reassortant virus capable to cause sustained outbreaks in a community (World Health Organization, 2012) . The WHO Director -General, Dr. Margaret Chan, did not recommend any trade or travel restrictions and advised to center on mitigation measures as the containment of the outbreak was not considered to be feasible (World Health Organization, 2009d) . Two days later, on 29 April, the influenza pandemic alert was raised to phase 5 (World Health Organization, 2009e) . This was a signal that a pandemic was c oming up and human to human spread of the virus into at least two countries of one WHO region was evident, namely Mexico and USA (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009h; World Health Organization, 2012) . In its first risk assessment, published on 30 April, the ECDC reported missing information and data to define the seriousness of the potential pandemic. So far, the m ajority of pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disease and the case fatality rate was judged not to be different from seasonal influenza (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009g) . On 30 April, the European Commission agreed on a common case definition for the European Union in order to detect cases of influenza caused by the new virus. This case definition is presented in Table 4. 35 Table 4: EU case definition for pandemic A/H1N1 infection (European Commission, 2009a) Clinical criteria: Any person with one of the following thre e: fever > 38 \u00b0C AND signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection, pneumonia (severe respiratory illness), death from an unexplained acute respiratory illness. Laboratory criteria: At least one of the following tests: RT-PCR, viral culture (requiring BSL 3 facilities), four-fold rise in novel influenza virus A/H1N1 specific neutralizing antibodies (implies the need for paired sera, from acute phase illness and then at convalescent stage 10 -14 days later minimum). Epidemiological criteria : At least one of the following three in the seven days before disease onset: a person who was a close contact to a confirmed case of novel influenza A/H1N1 virus infection while the case was ill, a person who has travelled to an area where sustained human -to-human transmission of novel influenza A/H1N1 is documented, a person working in a laboratory where samples of the novel influenza A/H1N1 virus are tested. Case classification : A. Case under investigation: Any person meeting the clinical and epidemiological criteria. B. Probable case: Any person meeting the clinical AND epidemiological criteria AND with a laboratory result showing positive influenza A infection of an unsubtypable type. C. Confirmed case: Any person meeting the laboratory criteria for confirmation. In its risk assessment update on 20 May, the ECDC again reported a continuing lack of data on parameters needed for right risk assessment. The ECDC considered available data and stated that the pandemic A/H1N1 infections have been generally mild in Europe. Now there was more evidence that the virus was able to spread easily from one person to another and that it preferentially infected younger age groups. ECDC concluded that the spread of the 36 pandemic A/H1N1 virus will continue (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009p) . On 11 June, the WHO raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 6, declaring a pandemic (World Healt h Organization, 2009h) . The severity of the pandemic was considered to be moderate by the WHO (World Health Organization, 2009i) . The UK, Germany, Spain, Denmark and Czech Republic had different pandemic profiles during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. Therefore, in the following, the aspects epidemiology and progress of A/H1N1 pandemic, surveillance, pandemic management strategy, vaccination strategy , communication as well as risk perception and human behavior are presented separately for each of the countries included. 3.1 Germany 3.1.1 Epidemiology and p rogress of the A/H1N1 pandemic The blue bars in Figure 3 show the number of A/H1N1 cases per week as derived from influenza notification data collec ted by the local health authorities according to the German Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionssc hutzgesetz; IfSG). The first laboratory confirmed cases in Germany were reported on 29 April 2009 (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009h) . As of 30 April, three confirmed ca ses have been reported in Germany. Shortly after, secondary transmission of the virus was notified in Germany (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009i) . The numb ers of confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases increased constantly. By the end of June, Germany has reported 429 confirmed cases. 37 Initially, pandemic A/H1N1 infections occurred among travelers returning from North America. Until week 28/2009 limited spread of the diseases was observed in Germany. With the beginning of the summer holidays , the number of travelers returning from affected countries, like Spain, increased and t he numbers of confirmed cases began to rise until early August (Buda et al., 2010) . In its Threat Assessment, published on 1 July, the ECDC announced the first isolation of an oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu\u00ae) resistant mutant A/H1N1 virus in Denmark. The virus was not a reassortant virus and was still susceptible to zanamivir (also known as Relenza\u00ae). There was no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to other persons. ECDC stated that this phenomenon is well -known in influenza viruses and emphasized the need for continued surveillance of this problem (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009u) . According to an ECDC risk assessment published on 20 July, 20 -30% of the population was expected to be affected over the first major wave of the pandemic. Clinical a ttack rates were expected to be highest in children and young adults. The estimate for h ospitalization rate s in Europ e was 1 -2% and the case fatality rate was estimated to be 0.1 -0.2% of all clinical cases. ECDC stated that most cases experienced a mild and self -limiting illness, but people with chronic underlying medical conditions, pregnant women and young children wer e at higher risk of experiencing severe disease and deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009w) . As of 4 August, Germany has reported 7177 confirmed cases to the ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009aa) . The virus continued to spread in the count ry, but at a low level over the summer (see Figure 3). On 25 September, Germany reported the first fatal case from pandemic A/H1N1 infection (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009j) . The red curve in Figure 3 illustrates the reported number of confirmed A/H1N1 deaths during the pandemic. 38 On 21 August, the ECDC published its planning assumptions for the first major wave of infection, which was expected to take place in the autumn and winter of 2009/2010. However, these planning assumptions did not differ from those published on 20 July (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ab) . In late September, the ECDC has reduced its planning assumption. This decision was based on experience from Southern Hemisphere countries . It became more apparent that most pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disease; therefore hospitalization and case fatality rates were revised downwards (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ad) . In early autumn, the numbers of pandem ic A/H1N1 infections in Germany have started to increase again, indicating the beginning of the expected autumn/winter wave . The second wave reached its peak in week 47/2009 (Buda et al. , 2010) . On 16 November, Germany has reported 16 deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ah) . Thereafter influenza A/H1N1 activity decreased steadily. As more information on the pandemic A/H1N1 virus became available showing that it remains relatively mild for most people and suggesting that the second peak may not be as high as actu ally thought , ECDC has revised its planning assumptions. In its 7th risk assessment issued on 6 November the following EU reasonable worst case planning assumptions for the first year up to mid -May 2010 were published: clinical attack rate: up to 20% of po pulation, hospitalization rate: up to 100 per 100.000 population and case fatality rate: up to 3 per 100.000 population (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ag) . The pandemic influenza wave en ded in week 2/2010 and afterwards only sporadic cases have been reported (Buda et al., 2010 ). The last virus detection within th e sentinel system 39 by the influenza working group (Ar beitsgemeinschaft Influenza ) for the occurrence of acute respiratory diseases in primary health care practices , in which 879 primary care physicians across Germany participated in the season 2009/2010, wa s in week 12/2010.T he number of reporte d deaths, however, increased from 176 in mid -January to 235 in m id-February (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , 2010 c,d). By April 2010, 225.729 cases and 250 deaths of pandemic A/H1N1 virus have been reported to the Robert Koch -Institut e according to IfSG (Buda et al. , 2010) . The infection caused a mild illness in most cases. Infection rates were highest in children and young adults. A subset of cases experien ced severe disease, especially in those with underlying risk factors. 86% of the 250 deaths attributable to pandemic A/H1N1 virus had an underlying risk factor (chronic condition or pregnancy) (Schaberg & Burger, 2010) . In February 2010, evidence showed decreasing or low pandemic A/H1N1 activity in many countries, but the WHO Emergency Committ ee agreed that it was too early to conclude that the pandemic A/H1N1 virus has run its course. Thus, the pandemic influenza alert phase was not changed (World Health Organization, 2010a) . On 10 August 2010, the WHO Emergency Committee assessed the g lobal situation again. This time the Committee concluded that the world was entering the post -pandemic period (World Health Organization, 2010c) . 3.1.2 Surveillance Influenza is a notifiable disease in Germany. According to \u00a7 7 IfSG laboratories have to report direct evidence of influenza to loc al health authorities and the local health authorities forward the notifications to the Robert Koch -Institut e (RKI). As national reference laboratory for influenza (NRZ), the RKI performed the virological surveillance together with cooperating laboratories of four national states. To receive information on pandemic A/H1N1 infections at an early stage, a new notification regulation for physicians under \u00a7 6 IfSG came into force on 3 May 2009 stating that all suspected cases, confirmed cases and deaths from pandemic A/H1N1 virus have to be reported by name to the local health 40 authorities (Bundesmini sterium der Justiz, 2009) . On 13 July, the surveillance strategy in Germany was modified. From week 29/2009 onwards regional health authorities were no longer required to submit reports on suspected cases to the state health authorities or to the Robert Koch -Institut e (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a) . On 16 July, the WHO announced that countries with community -wide transmission are no longer required to forward regular reports of individual confirmed cases to the WHO, as the detection, laborator y-confirmation and investigation of all cases is extremely resource - intensive and not sustainable for these countries (World Health Organization, 2009k) . In view of increasing numbers of A/H1N1 infections , the German surveillance strategy was again modified. From week 46/2009 onwards only laboratory confirmed cases and deaths relating to a pandemic A/H1N1 infection had to be reported to the RKI (Buda et al. , 2010) . For reducing the reporting effort for local health authorities, it was possible to only forward weekly aggregated case numbers to state health authorities and the RKI. In addition, laboratory testing was only recommended and reimbursed for cases with a high risk of developing severe disease, in order to ensure laboratory capacity and to reduce costs (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a) . In order to gather information on hospitalizations and deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 infections, the RKI set up the Pandemic Influenza A/H1N1 Hospital Surveillance System ( , all hospitals were able to forward weekly aggregated numbers of hospital admission and deaths relating to a pandemic A/H1N1 infection to the RKI on a voluntary basis (Buda et al. , 2010) . 41 Figure 3: Epidemiology , key events and media attention during the A/H1N1 pandemic in Germany Sources : Number of new A/H1N1 cases per week: Robert Koch -Institut Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza.

Euro Surveillance , 17(4). 42 3.1.3 Pandemic management strategy Initially, Germany employed a containment strategy. Measures focused on limiting transmission of the virus or delaying the spread in order to gain time to apply effective response measures. This strategy included the following public health measures: those who met the clinical and epidemiological case definition were assessed through swabbing and laboratory testing; cases were treated with antivirals within 48 hours after onset of symptoms and requested to isolate at home or in hospital (depending on their clinical condition) for at least seven days. Contacts were additionally asked to self -isolate at home for seven days with restrictions on visits (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a ). In order t o avoid the introduction of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus through inter national air traffic, health authorities agreed that instead of meeting all flights from Mexico, suspected cases had to be notified by the pilot of the plane and were examined at the airport of destination by medical teams. Contact details of passengers we re collected and information leaflets about pandemic influenza were distributed (Marcic et al. , 2010) . The infection control me asures at German airports were kept up until week 35/2009 (Robert Koch - Institut e, 2010a) . School closures were not recommended as a means of reducing the spread of the virus (Robert Koch -Institut e 2010a) . In early August 2009, Germany has changed its response strategy and mo ved to a mitigation strategy. The new strategy focused on risk groups and included the following changes: Contact -tracing was ceased, isolation was recommended for cases with contact to vulnerable persons only, antivirals were only given to cases in at -risk groups with signs of developing severe illness, case -based reporting requirements were relaxed and in late August infection control measures at airports were reduced (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a) . In week 35/2009 infection control measures at German airports were reduced (Robert Koch - Institut e, 2010a) . 43 3.1.4 Vaccination strategy As the new virus first emerged in April 2009, it was not possible to adjust the 2009/2010 seasonal influenza vaccine to this new influenza A/H1N1 strain (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009c) . The production of a pandemic -specific vaccine takes four to six months and can only be started when the new strain has been isolated (Hine, 2010) . At the time Germany started to develop its vaccination strategy, the severity and infectivity of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus was still uncertain. Thus, it was difficult to decide on the quantity of required vaccine (Marcic et al. , 2010) . Germany had advance -purchase agreement contracts with vaccine manufacturers in order to secure su fficient vaccine supply in the event of a pandemic. These contracts were a result of Germany's pre -pandemic planning and were activated with the announcement of pandemic influenza alert phase 6 (Marcic et al. , 2010) . The advance -purchase agreements in place included the assumption that enough vaccine for 100% of the population to have two doses would be needed (Marcic et al. , 2010) . Later, this assumption was revised downwards and only 50 million doses of pandemic vaccine were ordered (Feufel et al. , 2010) . As initial supplies of pandemic vaccine wer e limited, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization recommended that the following groups should be prioritized for vaccination: health -care workers , pregnant women , individuals aged above six months with a chronic medical conditi on, healthy individuals aged between 15 years and up to 49 years , healthy children , healthy individuals aged between 50 years and up to 64 years , and healthy individuals aged 65 years or above. The order of priority should be based on country -specific cond itions (World He alth Organization, 2009j) . On 29 September, the European Commission authorized the first two pandemic vaccines Focetria\u00ae (Novartis) and Pandemrix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline) for use in all Member States of the European Union and in Iceland, Liechtenstein and N orway (European Commission, 2009b) . 44 On 6 October, the European Commission authorized a third pandemic vaccine, Celvapan\u00ae, for use in all EU Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009c) . On 12 October , the Robert Koch -Institut e published the priority groups for vaccination recommended by the German Committee on Vaccination (St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission; STIKO). According to the STIKO, thre e groups were identified to be prioritized for vaccination in the following order: front -line health and social care workers , individuals aged six months and above in a clinical at -risk group and pregnant women. Clinical at -risk groups were considered to b e the same as in the UK (see 3.2.). The Robert Koch -Institut e and Paul - Ehrlich -Institut e recommended a one -dose schedule for Pandemrix\u00ae for those aged 10 and up to 60 years. Individuals above 60 years of age should receive two doses and children aged below ten and over six months two half adult doses of Pandemrix\u00ae (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009c) . While t he Robert Koch -Institut e and the Paul -Ehrlich -Institut e considered a one dose schedule for Pandemrix\u00ae to be sufficient for those aged 10 years and above, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended a two dose schedule for all three authorized vaccines (European Medicines Agency, 2009b) . The German vaccination program started on 26 October (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, 2009) . Based on new data suggesting tha t young children and adolescents have an increased risk of contracting the pandemic A/H1N1 virus and of developing severe disease from the virus, the German Committee on Vaccination extended its recommendations on priority groups for vaccination. This upda te was published on 14 December and included the following changes: After vaccination of the three identified priority groups , vaccine should also be offered to household contacts of people in at -risk groups, all children and adolescents aged between 6 mon ths and 24 years, all adults aged between 25 and 59 years, and all individuals aged 60 years and over (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009f) . In addition to the updated recomm endations on priority groups for vaccination by 45 the German Committee on Vaccination, the Robert Koch -Institut e (RKI) and Paul -Ehrlich - Institut e (PEI) updated their recommendations on vaccine dosage. Now, the RKI and PEI recommended a one -dose schedule for those aged 10 and above and one half adult dose schedule for children aged between 6 months and 9 years (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009g) . 3.1.5 Communication In order to give a better overview, the information published during the pandemic is grouped around the themes: Communication related to personal protective m easures, communication related to A/H1N1 treatment, communication related to pandemic management strategy, communication related to A/H1N1 vaccination and communication in the media . Communication related to p ersonal protective measures In Germany, the Robert Koch -Institut e (RKI) and the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) had already launched the information campaign \"Wir gegen Viren\" in March 2009, before pandemic A/H1N1 infections occurred in Germany. This campaign aimed to convey basic knowled ge on hygiene and personal protective measures to the public in order to prevent viral infections. For the dissemination of the information, the RKI and BZgA developed posters, leaflets, sticker s and a TV spot on hand washing (Robert Koch -Institut e & Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, 2009) . During the pandemic, these media were then refined and adjusted to the pandemic A/H1N1 influenza (Mar tin, 2010) . On 27 April, German health authority staff at airports started to distribute information leaflets in four different languages to travelers from affected countries. The leaflets informed about pandemic A/H1N1 symptoms and advised travelers t o seek medical care in case of onset of symptoms. On the same day, the RKI set up an information hotline to provide a response to inquiries from citizens (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a) . In addition to the public information and advice on nation al level, the ECDC provided information on European level. On 27 April, the ECDC published the first general questions and answers on pandemic A/H1N1 virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . In M ay, the ECDC published two documents on personal protective 46 measures and information for travelers. The documents described personal protective measures to reduce the risk of acquiring influenza, i.e. regular hand washing, respiratory hygiene, avoidance of close contacts and mass gatherings (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009k, 2009m, 2009n) . On 15 July, Germany started its A/H1N1 pandemic information campaign by publishing an information leaflet on personal protective measures in eleven langu ages (Die Beauftragte der Bundesregierung f\u00fcr Migra tion, Fl\u00fcchtlinge und Integration, 2009) . In addition, the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) provided information to the public on modes of transmission, symptoms of an A/H1N1 infection and on general hygiene measures to prevent the spread of t he virus (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, 2009a) . Further, the Robert Koch -Institut e developed a document tha t aimed to inform the public about the influenza virus es and a pan demic in general , about modes of transmission of influenza viruses and about personal protective measures to prevent an influenza infection (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009i) . During the summer holiday season , Germany observed importations of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus from affected countries, especially from Spain. Thus, in early August the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) in Germany issued a press release on personal protective measures on vacation to remind holiday -maker s of performing the recommended hygiene measures even on holiday (i.e. avoidance of close contacts with sick pe ople, frequently hand washing, good respiratory hygiene, self sick people) (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, 2009b) . Before the start of the vaccination program , the F ederal Ministry of Health in Germany has revised its offer of information. In order t o provide solid information for the general public and for health professionals , the Federal Ministry of Health, together with the Robert Koch - Institut e, the Federal Centre for Health Education and the Paul -Ehrlich -Institut e, launched the central information website www.neuegrippe.bund.de (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr 47 Gesundheit, 2009) . This website provided information on the pandemic A/H1N1 virus, personal protective measures and the pandemic vaccine . In late October, the Federal Centre fo r Health Education developed a media package on hygiene practices for schools and kindergartens , called \"sch\u00fctz ich mich -sch\u00fctz ich dich\". Posters, stickers and leaflets aimed to inform children and adolescents on proper hand and respiratory hygiene . The materials were produced in two different designs to ensure age - appropriate speech of children an d adolescents (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, 2009c) . Communication reatm ent The use of antivirals in some groups involves particularities health professionals should know . Thus, on 8 May, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a guidance document on the use of the antiviral medicine Tamiflu in children under one year of age and the antivirals Tamiflu and Relen za in pregnant and breastfeeding women in the case of an influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. The EMA stated that in the event of a pandemic Tamiflu can be used to treat children under the age of one and both antivirals can be used to treat pregnant women, as the be nefits of their use outweigh their risks (European Medicines Agency, 2009a) . On 18 August, the ECDC published general guidance on the use of antivirals during influenza pandemics. T he document aimed to inform those deciding on antiviral use strategies about the effectiveness of antivirals, side effects of antivirals, priority groups for antiviral use and about necessary arrangements for antiviral delivery and administration (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009y) . In late October, the RKI published a guidance document for physicians. This document contained information on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus, the antiviral treatment, the vaccination, the notification regulations, and preventive and control measures (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009a) 48 Communication related to pandemic control measures On 19 May, the ECDC published a guidance document on case and contact management. The recommended measures did not differ from the measures already applied in Germany, Spain and the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009o) . On 6 June, the ECDC published a guidance document on mitigation and containment strategies for national health authorities. ECDC stated that many public health measures are common in both strategies and the implementation of a mitigation strategy would mainly mean to move away from vigorous case finding and contact tracing. Further, the ECDC acknowledged that a containment strategy is very resource -intensive and therefore not a recommended infection control strategy for human influenza beyond pandemic alert phase 4 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009r) . On 26 June, the WHO published a guidance document on public health measures to help countries manage the A/H1N1 pandemic. Besides giving general advice on response measures, the WHO provided additional advice for countries with widespread community - level t ransmission, for countries with no reported cases and for countries in transition. The WHO advised all countries to concentrate on mitigation measures, to prepare the health -care system for a high volume of patients and to ensure antiviral medicine and vac cine supply. In addition, countries with widespread community -level transmission were advised to cease laboratory -testing of all cases, to reduce the pressure on the health -care system, to primarily focus on the treatment of ill patients, and to consider s chool closures or the cancellation of mass gathering on a case -by-case basis. Countries with no reported cases were advised that they may consider entry screening at airports and contact tracing, but that these measures are resource intensive and of limite d benefit to prevent the spread of the disease. Countries in transition were advised to start the same control measures as countries with widespread community -level transmission (World Health Organization, 2009a) . On 20 July, the ECDC gave scientific advice on reactive and proactive school closures in Europe. ECDC highlighted that there is no consensus on the benefits from proactive school 49 closures ( school closure before transmission be tween the children occurs), bu t countries and schools were advised to at least have plans for reactive school closures (school closure when many children and/or staff are experiencing illness) . These plans should consider the following issues: recommended length of time of closure , the triggers for re -opening , how to sustain teaching and learning and potential problems that may arise for parents, if they have to take time off work (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009x) . In mid -September, the ECDC published a document on public health measures for policy and decision -makers (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . It provided scientific information on measures that may be applied to reduce the impact of influenza pandemics (i.e. border closures, entry restrictions, personal protective measures , social distancing measures, use of antivirals and vaccines) and aimed to help EU countries to decide on appropriate response measures (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009a) . On 23 September, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 5th meeting and agreed on continuing the following recommendations proposed by the WHO Director -General: borders should not be closed and travel and trade should not be restricted, countries should intensify surveillance of unusual events and people who are ill should postpone international travel (World Health Organization, 2009n) . Due to incre asing numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 cases, the Robert Koch -Institut e received many queries regarding the effectiveness of school closures as a means to contain the spread of the virus. Thus, on 16 November, the RKI published a brief overview on aspects of reactive and proactive school closures and stated that with respect to the current epidemiological situation proactive school closures were not recommended. Further, the RKI stated that decisions on reactive school closures should depend on the epidemiological situation but an effect on the progress of the pandemic wave ca nnot be expected from reactive school closures (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009e) . 50 On 26 November, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 6th meeting and agreed that delaying international travel was no longer recommended for ill perso ns, because pandemic A/H1N1 infections were already widespread (World Health Organization, 2009p) . Communication related to A/H1N1 vaccination Referring to media reports that have displayed concern about the safety of pandemic vaccine s, the WHO has i ssued a note on pandemic vaccine safety on 6 August. In this statement the WHO outlined the procedures for approval and licensing of vaccines and confirmed that these procedures are strict and do include safety and quality controls. The WHO also stated tha t the data on influenza vaccine safety collected during the last 60 years do not show a special safety issue. Nonetheless, the WHO advised countries to closely monitor the safety and efficacy of the pandemic vaccine, as rare adverse events may only occur when large numbers of people got vaccinated (World Health Organization, 2009l) . On 13 August, the ECDC published a document on the use of influenza pandemic vaccines during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The document aimed to inform those deciding on vaccination policies in the European countries on vaccine use and options for prioritization in order to maximize the benefit of available vaccine (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009z) . On 4 September , the German Paul -Ehrlich -Institut e issued information for physicians and pharmacists on the safety of pandemic vaccines during pregnancy. The P aul-Ehrlich - Institut e considered existing scientific evidence and concluded that the pandemic A/H1N1 vaccine s do not pose a risk to pregnant women. However, the Paul -Ehrlich -Institut e stated that this conclusion did not involve the recommendation of vaccin ating all pregnant women at this point and recommended to only vaccinate pregnant women if the potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh its potential risks (Paul -Ehrlich -Institut e, 2009) . Together with the start of the vaccination program, the public information campaign was launched in Germany. Information and advice was accessible on government websites and made available to the general public through leaflets (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit et 51 al.., 2009e ). In addition to the mainstream public information, the Federal Ministry of Health in Germany published t ailored information for specific target groups (i.e. people with chronic underlying conditions , health professionals , pregnant women; and fire fighters 2009a, 2009b, 2009c, 2009d) . Furthermore, clinical professional brief information on pandemic vaccination were published (Robert Koch -Institut e & Paul -Ehrlich -Institut e, 2009) . On European level, information on vaccination was provided by the ECDC. In November the ECDC published questions and answers on vaccines for health professionals and for the general public on its website (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009b, 2009c, 2010a) . On 19 November, the WHO issued a briefing note on pandemic vaccines in which the safety of the vaccines was reaffirmed (World Health Organization, 2009o) . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) did hold the same opinion. In a press release published on 20 November, the EMA reasse rted the efficacy and safety of pandemic vaccines. Further, the EMA revised its advice on vaccine schedules and published the following recommendations: Pandemrix\u00ae and Focetria\u00ae may be used as a single dose in adults (18 -60 years) and in children and adole scents (Focetria\u00ae: from the age of 9 years; Pandemrix\u00ae: from the age of 10 years). Individuals aged over 60 years may also receive one dose of Pandemrix\u00ae, but younger children and immunocompromised people should receive two doses (European Medicines Agency, 2009c) . Between December 2009 and August 2010, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published regular updates on safety monitoring of vaccines and medicines used during the pandemic (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . In its update on pandemic medicines of 18 December, the EMA reaffirmed that the available data on the three pandemic vaccines and Tamiflu \u00ae showed no unexpected serious safety issues (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . 52 Communication in the media The number of A/H1N1 associated media stories published in the main news TV show (ARD Tagesschau), two important daily newspapers (FAZ, Bild) and one of the main weekly newspapers (Spiegel) is illustrated in the purple curve in Figure 3. This curve show s two major peaks over the time of the pandemic (week 14/2009 - week 14/2010). It reached the first peak in week 18 (69 A/H1N1 associated media stories), when the WHO declared the pandemic phase 4 and shortly after, the pandemic phase 5. T he media attention was significantly lower (13 A/H1N1 associated media storie s) in week 19, when the first laboratory -confirmed case occurred in Germany. The WHO declared the pandemic phase six in week 24, when 21 A/H1N1 associated media stories were published. The attention rose again from week 29 onwards. At this time, the number of new A/H1N1 cases per week also stared to rise. Shortly after the definition of the vaccine priority groups by the German Committee on Vaccination (week 42) and the start of the vaccination program (week 44), the media attention rose again and reached the second peak in week 45 (33 A/H1N1 associat ed media stories). Thereafter, the number of A/H1N1 associated media stories declined steadily and remained at a low level until week 14 /2010. Figure 4 shows the res ults from the Google Flu Trends analysis for Germany from July to June for the 2009/2010 A/H1N1 as well as for the 2013/2014 season. In mid -September 2009 , when the number of new A/H1N1 cases started to rise (see Figure 3), the number of influenza -associated web searches also rose fr om low to moderate. In November 2009, the influenza -associated web searches reached a high level, which is also the time of the p eak in new A/H1N1 cases from week 45 to week 49 (see Figure 3). Thereafter, the frequency of influenza -associated web searches declined steadily. 53 Figure 4: Search activity in Google for influenza like illness in Germany 3.1.6 Risk perception and human behavior To monitor pandemic influenza A/H1N1 vaccine uptake during the vaccination campaign in Germany, 13 telephone -surveys were performed between November 2009 and April 2010 . The vaccination uptake among the survey participants is illustrated in the green curve in Figure 3. According to the surveys, the vaccination coverage in persons 14 years of age was 4. 6% (N=1000) in week 47 and 6% in week 49. After this rather sharp increase in vaccination coverage, th e curve remains at a plateau at approximately 8%, before reaching roughly 10% in week 10, 2010 (Walter et al., 2011) . The aforementioned 13 surveys were also monitor ing knowledge, attitude and behavio r concerning pandemic influenza infection and vaccination against pandemic influen za. During the peak of the pandemic in week 47 , only 18% (N=1000) of participant s perceived the risk due to swine flu as great or partially great and 34% stated their perception of risk was low (Walter et al. ., 2011, 2012) . In late November 2009 , the Gallup Organization conducted a survey called the Eurobarometer in the 27 EU Member States, as well as in Norway, Switzerland and Iceland to examine public opinion about influenza and pandemic A/H1N1. 69% (N=1001) believed it was unlikely or rather unlikely that they would p ersonally catch the A/H1N1influenza . Very high High Moderate Low Minimal Germany:Nationwide 54 Furthermore, 62% stated that is was not likely or not likely at all that they would get vaccinated against the pandemic A/H1N1 virus. Health professionals were the most trusted source to inform about pandemic A/H1N1. 80 % mentioned that they trust health professionals mostly or completely (The Gallup Organization, 2010) . In week 51/2009, the vaccination coverage in persons 14 years of age was 8% (N=1000) according to the survey monitoring vaccine uptake during the vaccination campaign in Germany (Walter et al. ., 2011) . Furthermore, only 10% (N=1000) of participants perceived risk due to swine flu as great or par tially great . Accordingly, the proportion of participants perceiving a low risk increased from 34% (week 47) to 65% in March 2010 (week 10) (Walter et al. ., 2011, 2012) . In August 2010, t he VENICE (Vaccine European New Integrated Collaboration Effort) con- sortium conducted a web -based survey covering 27 European member states in addition to Norway and Iceland in order to estimate A/H1N1 vaccination coverage rates in different target groups and entire populations during the pandemic. For 22 countries, estimates on the vaccination coverage were provided. Table 5 shows the survey results for Germany. Table 5: A/H1N1 vaccination coverage in different target groups and the entire population in Germany (Mereckiene et al, 2012) Vaccination coverage (%) Country Overall (n=22) a 6 months of age with chronic diseases and underlying conditions (n=9) Pregnant women (n=12) b Children (n=12) c Healthcare workers (n=13) d Germany (data for age groups 14 years) 8 12 9 NA 16 55 a Some countries recommended pandemic vaccine for some population groups but calculated overall vaccination coverage. b Pregnant women: all countries that provided vaccination coverage recommended vaccination to all pregnant women (with or without risk indication). c Groups for which vaccination coverage were measured: France, Iceland, Italy, Norway and Slovenia (n=5), 6months -<18years of age; England, 6 months -<5 years age; Finland, 15 years of age; Ireland, >6months -<15years or age; Luxembourg, at risk; Netherlands, 6 months -4years of age; Portugal, 6 months - 12 years of age. d Healthcare workers: Czech Republic, England, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal (n=5) recommended pandemic vaccine to only healthcare workers with close contact with patients; Estonia recommended for healthcare work- ers with close contact with patient and with no contact with patients, bu t contact with potentially contaminated material; Hungary, Malta, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Slovakia (n=6) recommended pandemic vaccine to all healthcare workers. In the 13 surveys on vaccination and risk perception mentioned above, respondents who were not vaccinated or did not intend to be vaccinated were asked for their reason to object to vaccination. Approximately 20% of the participants named fear of adverse events and 15% perceived the vaccines as not sufficiently tested. Further, 14% decided aga inst being vaccinated because of 'public panicking and overhyping' and for 10%, the being vaccinated was perceived as simply not necessary. Only 2% of the respondents reported a lack of information about the vaccine and potential side effects as a reason (Walter, 2012) . 3.2 The United Kingdom 3.2.1 Epidemiology and progress of A/H1N1 pandemic The blue bars in Figure 5 represent the number of A/H1N1 cases per week in the UK. The first two laboratory confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases have been reported in the UK on 27 April (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009f) . Shortly after, secondary transmission of the virus was also notified in the UK (European Centre for Disease Preventio n and Control, 2009i) . At the start of the Sixty -second World Health Assembly on 18 May, members shared their experiences with the current outbreak of pandemic influenza A/H1N1. Altogether, 40 countries have reported 8829 confirmed cases of pandemic A/H1N1. 97, 9% of the total number of cases was reported by six countries: the USA (4714 56 cases), Mexico (3103 cases), Canada (496 cases), Japan (125 cases), Spain (103 cases)3 and the UK (101) (World Health Organization, 2009f ). As of 15 June, the UK has reported 1320 confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 to the ECDC. Additionally, the first fatal case in Europe was reported in Scotland (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009t) . The reported number of confirmed A/H1N1 deaths is illustrated in the red curve in Figure 5. As Figure 5 shows , the UK experienced two waves of pandemic A/H1N1 activity. Initially, the UK observed s poradic importations of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus from Mexico and the US. As sustained community transmission developed in June, the number of pandemic A/H1N1 cases increased sharply until the peak of the first wave in week 27/2009. The West Midlands, Lond on and central Scotland were most affected at the beginning of the A/H1N1 outbreak in the UK. By the end of June almost 7000 confirmed cases were reported (Health Protection Agency, 2010b) . On 1 July, the UK has reported three fatal cases (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009v) . In its Threat Assessment, published on 1 July, the ECDC announced the first isolation of an oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu\u00ae) resistant mutant A/H1N1 virus in Denmark. The virus was not a reassortant virus and was still susceptible to zanamivir (also kn own as Relenza\u00ae). There was no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to other persons. ECDC stated that this phenomenon is well -known in influenza viruses and emphasized the need for continued surveillance of this problem (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009u) . 3 Please note that the number of cases shown in Figure 13 differs from this number of cases. Figure 13 only shows data on confirmed cases from the SISS as the Spanish Ministry of Health and Social Policy (MHSP) stopped reporting total numbers of cases on 28 July 2009. Hereafter, the MHSP only reported incidence rates which were calculated from the SISS data (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009c) . 57 On 16 July, the Departm ent of Health in the UK made its first planning assumptions public. The figures represented a \"reasonable worst case\", not a prediction on how the pandemic will evolve. The following key planning assumptions for the first major pandemic wave were published : 18.69 million cases, 370.000 people hospitalized, 2.8 million people with complications and up to 65.000 deaths. These figures referred to the total UK population of about 62.3 million (Department of Health, 2009e) . According to an ECDC risk assessment published on 20 July, 20 -30% o f the population was expected to be affected over the first major wave of the pandemic. Clinical a ttack rates were expected to be highest in children and young adults. The estimate for h ospitalization rate s in Europe was 1 -2% and the case fatality rate was estimated to be 0.1 -0.2% of all clinical cases. ECDC stated that most cases experienced a mild and self -limiting illness, but people with chronic underlying medical conditions, pregnant women and young children were at higher risk of experiencing severe d isease and deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009w) . As of 4 August, the UK the UK has reported 11912 cases to the ECDC. The UK has stopped laboratory testing of all su spected cases; therefore , the reported numbers severely underestimate the true figure in the country. So far, the UK has recorded 30 deaths from pandemic A/H1N1 infection (Europ ean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009aa) . The virus continued to spread in the country, but at a low level over the summer (see Figure 5). The closure of schools was supposed to be responsible for this decline of infections as transmission accelerated again in late September with the return to school. On 21 August, the ECDC published its planning assumptions for the first major wave of infection, which was expected to take place in the autumn and winter of 2009/2010. However, these planning assumptions did not differ from those published on 20 July (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Con trol, 2009ab) . 58 In contrast to the ECDC, the Department of Health in the UK has modified its planning assumptions in early September. Based on the latest evidence on the severity of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus, the following values have been revised down wards: hospitalization r ate from 2% to 1% and upper case fatality rate from 0, 35% to 0, 1% (Department of Health, 2009i) . In late September, the ECDC has reduced its planning assumption as well. This decision was based on experience from Southern Hemisphere countries . It became more a pparent that most pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disease; therefore hospitalization and case fatality rates were revised downwards and were now in line with the figures published in the UK in early September (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ad) . In early autumn, the numbers of pandem ic A/H1N1 infections in the UK have started to increase again, indicating the beginning of the expected autumn/winter wave. In the UK the secon d wave peaked in week 45/2009 (Department of Health, 2010a) . Thereafter the numbers of infections declined constantly until the end of the second wave in early January 2010. Throughout the pandemic, the highest infection rates were observed in childr en and young people. Generally, the virus caused a mild illness. More severe disease was especially experienced by those cases with underlying conditions (Department of Health, 2010a) . On 15 October, the number of reported deaths in the UK reached 95 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ae) . On months later, this number had increased up to 185 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ah) . As more information on the pandemic A/H1N1 virus became available showing that it remains relatively mild for most people and suggesting that the second peak may not be as high as actually thought , the worst -case planning assumptions for the UK were revised downwards once more. In the new planning assumptions, published on 22 October, the reasonable worst case for the clinic al attack rate was reduced from 30% to 12% and the reasonable worst case for further deaths was reduced from 19.000 to 1.000 (Department of Health, 2009m) . In its 7th risk assessment issued on 6 November, the ECDC has revised its planning assumptions as well. The f ollowing EU reasonable worst case planning assumptions for the 59 first year up to mid -May 2010 were published: clinical attack rate: up to 20% of population, hospitalization rate: up to 100 per 100.000 population and case fatality rate: up to 3 per 100.000 p opulation (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ag) . On 30 November, the UK`s Scientific Advisory Groups for Emergencies held a meeting in which modelers announced that the pandemic had now pea ked and that the recently published worst case assumptions will not be reached (Department of Health. Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), 2009d) . The number of pandemic A/H1N1 infections decreased constantly in the UK. On 11 December, the UK has reported 283 deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009aj) . The end of the autumn wave was in early January 2010. Afterwards only sporadic cases have been reported (Department of Health, 2010a ). In February 2010, evidence showed decreasing or low pandemic A/H1N1 activity in many countries, but the WHO Emergency Committee agreed that it was too early to conclude that the pandemic A/H1N1 virus has run its course. Thus, the pandemic influenza alert p hase was not changed (World Health Organization, 2010a) . On 10 August 2010, the WHO Emergency Committee assessed the global situation again. This time the Committee concluded that the world was entering the post -pandemic period (World Health Organization, 2010c) . Altogether, the UK has reported 474 pandemic A/H1N1 influenza related deaths . Of these, 83% were in younger age groups (0 -64 years) and 18% had no underlying condition (Department of Health, 2010d) . During the first wave of transmission the UK employed a containmen t strategy until 2 July 2009. The aim of this strategy was to delay the spread of infection and thereby get more time to develop specific countermeasures, like pandemic vaccine. Those who met the clinical and epidemiological case definition were assessed t hrough swabbing and laboratory testing. Cases were requested to isolate at home or in hospital (depending on their clinical condition) for at least seven days. Close contacts were traced and offered antiviral prophylaxis. 60 Additionally, information on the v irus was gathered to get a better understanding of the disease course. During this initial containment phase specimens were taken from all suspected cases for laboratory testing (Health Protection Agency, 2010c) . From 2 July onwards cases were diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and laboratory confirmation was not required for every patient anymore (Health Protection Agency, 2010b) . Given this information, the numbers of confirmed cases from week 27/2009 onwards in Figure 5 do not reflect the actual number of cases in the UK and the sharp decline in after week 27/2009 is, besides the school closure for summer holidays, probably due to th is different test ing strategy. In order t o still monitor the magnitude of the pandemic in the population, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) in England started to calculate estimates the number of new clinical A/H1N1 cases in England from week 30 onwards. The were generated each week using a statistical model. The data were obtained from two surveillance systems: the primary care based QSurveillance scheme and the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and HPA Regional Microbiology Network sentinel surve illance scheme. In late July data from the National Pandemic Flu Service (NPFS) added (Health Protection Agency, 2009c) . To calculate the estimates GP (General Practitioner) and NPFS age -specific consultations rates, age specifi c positivity rates and estimated proportions of people who contacted their GP or the NPFS were used. To take uncertainty of proportions consulting health care into account, a range of estimates was calculated surrounding the central estimate (Health Protection Agency, 2010b) . Figure 12 shows the weekly number of confirmed A/H1N1 cases and the weekly estimates in England. The figure illustrates the aforementioned under -reporting of pandemic A/H1N1 cases from 2 July onwards, as the actual number of cases was estimated to be up to a hundred times higher than the number of confirmed cases in England. However, the pandemic profile as described above is still visible in both curves. 61 3.2.2 Surveillance On 30 April, the European Commission agreed on a common case definition for the European Union in order to detect cases of influenza caused by the new virus. This case definition is presented in Table 4. For monitoring and assessing the situation, the UK used the following existing influenza surveillance systems: For clinical surveillance through primary care the QSurveillance and Royal College of General Practitioner (RCGP) networks of sent inel General Practitioners (GP), as well as the telephone helpline NHS direct in England and Wales, and NHS 24 in Scotland were used. These systems provided estimates of influenza incidence to detect an increase in influenza infections as early as possible (Hine, 2010) . The WHO National Influenza Reference Centre for the United Kingdom is the Respiratory Virus Unit (RVU) of the Virus Reference Department at the Health Protection Agency. It collated virological data from its reference labor atories, from a nationwide laboratory reporting system and from general practitioners (Health Protection Agency, 2012) . On 2 July, the surveillance strategy in the UK was modified. This change implied that laboratory testing of all cases and cas e-tracing was ceased (Health Protection Agency, 2009d) . To monitor the safety of the medicines and vaccines that are on the market, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the UK has a an on -line report ing system in place, called the Yellow Card Scheme. This system is open to members of the public as well as healthcare professionals wanting to report suspected adverse drug reactions. On 6 July, a special web -based system for reporting suspected adverse d rug reactions to Tamiflu, Relenza and to future pandemic vaccine was put into operation for the duration of the pandemic (Medicines and Healthca re products Regulatory Agency, 2009a) . On 16 July, the WHO announced that countries with community -wide transmission are no longer required to forward regular reports of individual confirmed cases to the WHO, as the 62 detection, laboratory -confirmation and investigation of all cases is extremely resource - intensive and not sustainable for these countries (World Health Organization, 2009k) . In October, the Health Protection Agency set up a w eb based reporting system for NHS Trusts across England to gather information on hospitalized pandemic A/H1N1 cases. With this system the Health Protection Agency aimed to collect clinical, epidemiological and demographic data on all hospitalized cases with a confirmed pandemic A/H 1N1 infection (Health Protection Agency, 2010b) . 63 Figure 5: Epidemiology, key events and media attention during the A/H1N1 pandemic in UK Sources: Number of new A/H1N1 cases per week: Health et al.

Journal of epidemiology and community Health , 65(10), 941 -946. 65 3.2.3 Pandemic management strategy Initially, the UK employed a containment strategy. Measures focused on limiting transmission of the virus or delaying the spread in order to gain time to apply effective response measures. This strategy included the following public health measures: those who met the clinical and epidemiological case definition were assessed through swabbing and laboratory testing; cases were treated with antivirals within 48 hours after onset of symptoms and requested to isolate at home or in hospital (depending on their c linical condition) for at least seven days; close contacts were traced and offered antiviral prophylaxis. Contacts were asked to self -isolate only if they developed symptoms (Health Protection Agency, 2010b ). In order t o avoid the introduction of the pa ndemic A/H1N1 virus through international air traffic, the UK started to meet all direct flights from Mexico at an early stage. Medical teams checked passengers and crew members on clinical symptoms and distributed information leaflets about pandemic influ enza. In addition, contact details of passengers were collected to be able to inform them if it turned out that a person with confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 infection was aboard the same flight (Hine, 2010) . Health protection authorities in the UK advised schools to close for one week in the event of a confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 case at school and antiviral prophylaxis was given to all close contacts. The first school closure in the UK was on 29 April. On the same day, Gordon Brown announced that in order to provide antivirals for 80% of the population, the antiviral stockpile was to be increased from 33, 5 million to 50 million doses (Hine, 2010) . To impleme nt the control strategy at regional level in England, the HPA put in place Flu Response Centers staffed by HPA and NHS staff (Health Protection Agency, 2010c) . On 20 May, the HPA in the UK proposed to change the act ions regarding the contact management at schools. Instead of offering antiviral prophylaxis to all contacts, only the closest contacts should be given antivirals to reduce the risk of viral resistance due to non - compliance with the specified course of trea tment (Department of Health. Scientific 66 Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), 2009a) . However, the UK maintained its initial containment actions until 22 May, at which point the first adjustment was made. Based on information on reduced prevalence of pandemic A/H1N1 in Mexico, the HPA stopped meeting all flight from Mexico (Health Prote ction Agency, 2009a) . As the numbers of cases increased steadily, the containment actions became more and more resource -intensive. Especially in the most affected areas in the UK, such as London and the West Midlands, the measures became unsustainable. Therefore, on 10 June, the initial containment approach in the UK was relaxed for \"hot spot\" areas. As proposed by the HPA, antiviral prophylaxis was only of fered to the closest contacts. Additionally, laboratory testing was not necessary anymore if the clinical diagnosis indicated a high probability that the case was positive (Health Protection Agency, 2010c; Hine, 2010) . Acknowledging that the containment of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus was no longer possible, the ministers in the UK changed the response strategy on 2 July. Due to the widesprea d of the virus within the UK, ministers decided to move from containment into the treatment phase. As already described in the previous chapter this change meant that laboratory testing was no longer required for all cases and case -tracing was ceased. Furt her, antiviral treatment was only offered to clinical cases (Health Protection Agency, 2009d) . Additionally, to relieve some of the pressures on the health system, the National Pandemic Flu Service was launched in England on 23 July. This was an online and telephone self -care service that allowed people to be assessed for pandemic flu and, if required, to get access to antivirals. If symptoms were causing concern or if cases were in an at -risk group, they were advised to contact their GP. Those who were authorized to receive antivirals were able to pick up the drugs from one of the 2.000 antiviral collection points that were established across England. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland A/H1N1 cases accessed antivirals throug h the normal primary care route, by taking a GP prescription to a pharmacy. In England, all clinical cases received antivirals, whereas GPs in the devolved administrations were advised to prescribe antivirals to cases in at -risk groups and any other cases based on clinical discretion (Department of Health, 2009f; Hine, 2010) . 67 The National Pandemic Flu Service (NPFS) was launched in England in order to reduce the pressure o n primary care. With decreasing numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 cases this service was not required anymore and was closed down on 11 February. During its operation, the NPFS distributed antivirals to 1.1 million people. Two months later, on 1st April, antivi ral collection points in England closed and the Swine Flu Information Line was stood down. Further, antivirals could no longer be collected from national stockpiles (Hine, 2010) . 3.2.4 Vaccination strategy As the new virus first emerged in Apri l 2009, it was not possible to adjust the 2009/2010 seasonal influenza vaccine to this new influenza A/H1N1 strain (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009c) . The production of a pandemic -specific vaccine takes four to six months and can only be started when the new strain has been isolated (Hine, 2010) . At the time the UK started to develop its vaccination strategy, the severity and infecti vity of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus was still uncertain. Thus, it was difficult to decide on the quantity of required vaccine (Hine, 2010; Marcic et al. , 2010) . The ministers in the UK decided to procure 90 million doses of pre -pandemic vaccine, enough for 45% of the population to have two doses. Pre -pand emic vaccines contain the virus strain most likely to be similar to the pandemic strain. The ministers in the UK started to negotiate with the vaccine manufactures GlaxoSmithKline and Baxter Healthcare on the supply of the pre - pandemic vaccine. In the end, no pre -pandemic vaccines were purchased, as the negotiations were still ongoing when the influenza pandemic alert phase 6 was declared by the WHO, which triggered the advance -purchase agreements (Hine, 2010) . The UK had advance - purchase agreement contracts with vaccine manufacturers in order to secure sufficient vaccine supply in the event of a pandemic. These contracts were a result of the UK's pre - pandemic planning and were activated with the announcement of pandemic influenza alert phase 6. On 17 June, the ministers in the UK decided to purchase pandemic vaccine for 100% of the population (Hine, 2010) . 68 The UK`s initial vaccination strategy was to provide pandemic vaccine for 100% of the population. Thus, on 26 June, co ntracts were signed with GlaxoSmithKline and Baxter Healthcare to make available 132 million doses of pandemic vaccine, enough for the whole population to have two doses of vaccine (Hine, 2010) . As initial supplies of pandemic vaccine we re limited, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization recommended that the following groups should be prioritized for vaccination: health -care workers; pregnant women; individuals aged above six months with a chronic medical condit ion; healthy individuals aged between 15 years and up to 49 years; healthy children; healthy individuals aged between 50 years and up to 64 years; and healthy individuals aged 65 years or above. The order of priority should be based on country -specific con ditions (World H ealth Organization, 2009j) . Three days later, on 16 July, UK ministers agreed on the following priority groups for vaccination advised by DH\u00b4s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization (JCVI) and previously endorsed by DH`s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE): individuals aged between six months and 65 years in the current seasonal flu at -risk group ; pregnant women; children aged between 3 years and up to 16 years; and frontline health and social care workers (Department of Health. Joint Commi ttee on Vaccination and Immunisation, 2009a; Department of Health. Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), 2009b; Hine, 2010) . At the beginning of the vaccine production, vaccine manufacturers had problems with low vaccine output. GlaxoSmithK line and Baxter Healthcare reacted to this problem by modifying their production process and thereby increased their vaccine output. Thus, on 29 July, the ministers in the UK decided to buy 30 million doses of additional pandemic vaccine from GlaxoSmithKli ne to ensure pandemic vaccine supply (Hine, 2010) . On 13 August, the priority groups for the pandemic A/H1N1 vaccination program were announced in the UK. Based on advice from the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunization (JCVI) a nd the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) four 69 groups have been identified to be at highest risk of developing severe disease from a pandemic A/H1N1 infection. These groups should be prioritized for vaccination in the following order: people aged between six months and up to 65 years in the present seasonal flu vaccine clinical at -risk groups, all pregnant women, household contacts of immunocompromised people, and individuals aged 65 in the present seasonal flu vaccine clinical at -risk group s. In addition, front -line health and social care workers should be vaccinated together with the first clinical at -risk group (Department of Health, 2009g) . Members of the clinical at -risk group were individuals with one of the fol lowing underlying clinical condition: chronic respiratory disease , chronic heart disease , chronic renal disease , chronic liver disease , chronic neurological disease , immunosuppression or diabetes mellitus (Department of Health, 2009h) . On 29 September, the European Commissi on authorized the first two pandemic vaccines Focetria\u00ae (Novartis) and Pandemrix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline) for use in all Member States of the European Union and in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009b) . On 6 Octo ber, the European Commission authorized a third pandemic vaccine, Celvapan\u00ae, for use in all EU Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009c) . As the European Commission has now authorized both vaccines procured by the UK (Pandemrix\u00ae and Celvapan\u00ae), the DH`s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization gave the following advice on vaccine dosage: one dose of Pandemrix\u00ae fo r those aged 10 year s and above , two doses fo r immunocompromised individuals , two half adult doses for children aged below ten years and over six months and two doses of Celvapan\u00ae for all age groups (Department of Health. Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, 2009c) . Four days later, on 12 October, this advice was endorsed by DH`s 70 Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) (Department of Health. Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), 2009c) . While the DH`s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization considered a one dose schedule for Pandemrix\u00ae to be sufficient for those aged 10 years and above, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended a two dose schedule for all three authorized vaccines (European Medicines Agency, 2009b) . On 21 October, the UK started its vaccination program (Department of Health, 2009k) . On 19 November, phase two of the UK`s vaccination progra m was announced by the Department of Health. Chief Medical Officer Liam Donaldson stated that the vaccination program will be extended and vaccine will also be offered to all children over six months of age and under five years old. This decision was based on evidence showing that this age group is at higher risk of developing severe disease from an A/H1N1 infection than other healthy age groups (Department of Health, 2009u) . In December, the UK extended its vaccination program. As already announced in mid- November, the UK started to offer pandemic vaccine to children over 6 months and under 5 years of age. The recommendation on the vaccine dosage was updated and one half adult dose of Pandemrix\u00ae was now considered to be sufficient for children over six months (Department of Health, 2009v) . The DH`s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization in the UK did not recommend to extend the vaccination program to other groups of the population . This recom mendation was based on the latest epidemiological evidence and modeling predictions, which showed that pandemic A/H1N1 activity has decreased and a third wave was unlikely (Department of Health. Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, 2010) . On 4 February, ministers approved this advice, but decided to set up a strategic reserve of 15 million doses of pandemic vaccine (Hine, 2010) . The Department of Health has already contacted Baxter Healthcare in late December 2009 to stop supply of Celvapan\u00ae from 28 February 2010. This was possible, because a break 71 clause was agreed with Baxter H ealthcare at the time the UK ordered the vaccine in 2009 (Hine, 2010) . On 14 January 2010, ministers agreed to stop deliveries of Pandemrix\u00ae as well. As this contract did not include a break clause, the Department of Health commenced nego tiations with GlaxoSmithKline over terminating vaccine deliveries. On 6 April, the Department of Health achieved agreement to only take deliveries of just under 35 million doses of Pandemrix \u00ae (The Secretary of State for Health, 2010) . 3.2.5 Communication In order to give a better overview, the information published during the pandemic is grouped around the themes: Communication related to personal protective measures, communication related to A/H1N1 treatment, communication related to pandemic control mea sures , communication related to A/H1N1 vaccination and communication in the media . Communication related to p ersonal protective measures On 30 April, the information campaign started in the UK. The campaign ran on TV, on the radio and in print media. Additionally, posters and leaflets were used and an information line was set up to provide up -to-date advice to the public. Further, advice and information was accessible on the government website. Same as in Spain and Germany, fo llowing good hygiene practices, i.e. using and disposing tissues and washing hands, was recommended as the best way to protect oneself from contracting the virus. To remember this, the UK campaign used the following slogan: \"Catch it, bin it, kill it\" (Department of Health, 2009a; Hine, 2010) . In addition to the public information and advice on national level, the ECDC provided information on European level. On 27 April, the ECDC published the firs t general questions and answers on pandemic A/H1N1 virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . In May, the ECDC published two documents on personal protective measures and information for travelers. The documents described personal protective measures to reduce the risk of acquiring influenza, i.e. regular hand washing, respiratory hygiene, avoidance of close contacts and mass gatherings (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009k, 2009m, 2009n) . 72 In early January, the Department of Health in the UK published information leaflets in 32 languages to provide information on the pandemic A/H1N1 virus, personal protective measures, and the vaccination program for people who cannot speak or read Engli sh and who may not have access to a regular flow of news, i.e., an asylum seeker or refugee or a member of an established migrant group (Department of Health, 2010b) . Communication related to A/H1N1 treatment The use of antivirals in some groups involves particularities health professionals should know . Thus, on 8 May, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a guidance document on the use of the antiviral medicine Tamiflu in children under one year of age and the antivirals Tamiflu and Relenza in pregnant and breastfeeding women in the case of an influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. The EMA stated that in the event of a pandemic Tamiflu can be used to treat children under the age of one and both antivirals can be used to t reat pregnant women, as the benefits of their use outweigh their risks (European Medicines Agency, 2009a) . In the UK, the following recommendations on the use of antivirals in child ren, pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding were published: zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae) or oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) can be used in pregnant women , but zanamivir was recommended as first choice for treatment and prophylaxis, the preferred antiviral medicine for breastfeeding women is oseltamivir, children under the age of one year should only be treated with oseltamivir, post exposure prophylaxis for children under the age of one should only be offered after a thorough benefit -risk assessment (Department of Health, 2009j) On 18 August, the ECDC published general guidance on the use of antivirals during influenza pandemics. The document aimed to inform those deciding on antiviral use strategies about the effectiveness of antivirals, side effects of antivirals, priority group s for antiviral use and about necessary arrangements for antiviral delivery and administration (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009y) . 73 The Department of Health in the UK published clinical management guidelines for adults , children and pregnant women (Department of Health & Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2009; Department of Health, 2009q) . A third document aimed to provide guidance for health professionals on the use of antiviral prophylaxis during the A/H1N1 pandemic. It informed on situations when the use of antiviral prophylaxis in pregnant women and people with underlying medical condi tions was considered to be appropriate (Department of Health, 2009l) . In addition, information for health and social care workers who are pregnant or in other at -risk groups was published (Department of Health, 2009o) . Communication related to pandemic control measures On 19 May, the ECDC published a guidance document on case and contact management. The recommended measures did not differ from th e measures already applied in Germany, Spain and the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009o) . On 6 June, the ECDC published a guidance document on mitigation and containment strategies for national health authorities. ECDC stated that many public health measures are common in both strat egies and the implementation of a mitigation strategy would mainly mean to move away from vigorous case finding and contact tracing. Further, the ECDC acknowledged that a containment strategy is very resource -intensive and therefore not a recommended infec tion control strategy for human influenza beyond pandemic alert phase 4 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009r) . On 26 June, the WHO published a guidance document on public health measures to help countries manage the A/H1N1 pandemic. Besides giving general advice on response measures, the WH O provided additional advice for countries with widespread community - level transmission, for countries with no reported cases and for countries in transition. The WHO advised all countries to concentrate on mitigation measures, to prepare the health -care system for a high volume of patients and to ensure antiviral medicine and vaccine supply. In addition, countries with widespread community -level transmission were advised to cease laboratory -testing of all cases, to reduce the pressure on the health -care sy stem, to primarily focus on the treatment of ill patients, and to consider school closures or the cancellation of 74 mass gathering on a case -by-case basis. Countries with no reported cases were advised that they may consider entry screening at airports and c ontact tracing, but that these measures are resource intensive and of limited benefit to prevent the spread of the disease. Countries in transition were advised to start the same control measures as countries with widespread community -level transmission (World Health Organization, 2009a) . On 2 July, the Department of Health in the UK published three documents on the new response strategy. The first document was intended for the NHS which outlined the rationale of the movement f rom containment to treatment and set responsibilities for the NHS during the treatment phase (Department of Health, 2009b) . The second document provided clear information to the public explaining why the UK has chosen to move to a treatment phase, and the third document summarized scientific issues relevant to the new response strategy (Department of Health, 2009c, 2009d) . On 20 July, the ECDC gave scientific advice on reactive and proactive school closures in Europe. ECDC highlighted that there is no consensus on the benefits from proactive school closures ( school closure before transmission be tween the children occurs), bu t countries and schools were advised to at least have plans for reactive school closures (school closure when many children and/or staff are experiencing illness) . These plans should consider the following issues: recommended length of time of closure; the triggers for re -opening; how to sustain teaching and learning; and potential problems that may arise for parents, if they have to take time off work (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009x) . In mid -September, the ECDC published a document on public health measures for policy and decision -makers (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . It provided scientific information on measures that may be applied to reduce the impact of influenza pandemics (i.e. border closures, entry restrictions, personal protective measure s, social distancing measures, use of antivirals and vaccines) and aimed to help EU countries to decide on appropriate response measures (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009a) . 75 On 23 September, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 5th meeting and agreed on continuing the following recommendations proposed by the WHO Director -General: borders should not be closed and travel and trade should not be restricted, countries should intensify surveillance of unusual events and people who are ill should postpone international travel (World Health Organization, 2009n) . On 26 Novemb er, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 6th meeting and agreed that delaying international travel was no longer recommended for ill persons, because pandemic A/H1N1 infections were already widespread (World Health Organization, 2009p) . Communication related to A/H1N1 vaccination Referring to media reports that have displayed concern about the safety of pandemic vaccine, the WHO has issued a note on pandemic vaccine safety on 6 August. In this statement the WHO outlined the procedures for approval and licensing of vaccines and confirmed that these procedures are strict and do include safety and quality controls. The WHO also stated that the data on influenza vaccine safety collected during the last 60 ye ars do not show a special safety issue. Nonetheless, the WHO advised countries to closely monitor the safety and efficacy of the pandemic vaccine, as rare adverse events may only occur when large numbers of people got vaccinated (World Health Organizat ion, 2009l) . On 13 August, the ECDC published a document on the use of influenza pandemic vaccines during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The document aimed to inform those deciding on vaccination policies in the European countries on vaccine use and options for prioritization in order to maximize the benefit of available vaccine (European Centre for Disease Preventio n and Control, 2009z) . Together with the start of the vaccination program, the public information campaign was launched in the UK. Information and advice was accessible on government websites and made available to the general public through leaflets (Department of Health, 2009n ). In addition to the mainstream public information, the Department of Health i n the UK produced 76 tailored information for health professionals and pregnant women (Department of Health, 2009r, 2009s) . Furthermore, clinical professional briefs on pandemic vaccination were published (Department of Health, 2009p, 2009t ). On 5 November, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK published its first adverse reaction analysis on pandemic vaccines. In this report, the MHRA stated that there have been no new safety issues identified and that the benefits for Celvapan\u00ae and Pandemrix\u00ae still outweigh their risks (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, 2009b) . On European level, information on vaccination was provided by the ECDC. In November , the ECDC published que stions and answers on vaccines for health professionals and for the general public on its website (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009b, 2009c, 2010a) . On 19 November, the WHO issued a briefing note on pandemic vaccines in which the safe ty of the vaccines was reaffirmed (World Hea lth Organization, 2009o) . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) did hold the same opinion. In a press release published on 20 November, the EMA reasserted the efficacy and safety of pandemic vaccines. Further, the EMA revised its advice on vaccine schedul es and published the following recommendations: Pandemrix\u00ae and Focetria\u00ae may be used as a single dose in adults (18 -60 years) and in children and adolescents (Focetria\u00ae: from the age of 9 years; Pandemrix\u00ae: from the age of 10 years). Individuals aged over 60 years may also receive one dose of Pandemrix\u00ae, but younger children and immunocompromised people should receive two doses (European Medicines Agency, 2009c) . In December 2009, the UK started to offer pandemic v accine to children over 6 months and under 5 years of age . The Department of Health developed a leaflet for parents that contained tailored information about the second phase of the vaccination program (Departmen t of Health, 2009w) . 77 Between December 2009 and August 2010, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published regular updates on safety monitoring of vaccines and medicines used during the pandemic (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . In its update on pandemic medicines of 18 December, the EMA reaffirmed that the available data on the three pandemic vaccines and Tamiflu \u00ae showed no unexpected serious safety issues (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . Communication in the media In the analysis of Hiltons & Hunts data set including 2374 articles mainly focusing on A/H1N1 published in the UK between 1 March 2009 and 28 February 2010, all articles from The Daily Telegraph & Sunday Telegraph, The Guardian, The Daily Mail & Mail on Sunday and The Sun were considered. This analysis resulted in 1142 articles in total (The Sun: 553, The Guardian: 236, The Daily Telegraph & Sunday Telegraph: 201, The Daily Mail & Mail on Sunday: 152) . The purple curve in Figure 5 shows the number of A/H1N1 associated media stories per week from week 14/2009 until week 14/2010 . Compared to the number of A/H1N1 associated media stories published in Germany, Spain and Czech Republic , the curve has a similar shape, but at a higher level. This may be due to the inclusion of four newspapers in contrast to three newspapers and the main TV news show in Ger many, Spain and Czech Republic and potentially differe nt in - and e xclusion criteria. The curve in Figure 5 also shows one major peak in week 18 and one smaller peek thereafter. In week 18, the WHO declared pandemic phase 4 and two days later, pandemic phase 5. In the same week, the first two laboratory -confirmed A/H1N1 case s were reported in the UK, but also the first case of secondary transmission. After week 18, the number of A/H1N1 associated media stories declined sharply and re mained at a low to moderate level until week 28 (12 A/H1N1 associated media stories in week 21, 34 in week 25 and 41 in week 27) . Then, the number of media stories increased steadily and reached a minor peak in week 30 (109 A/H1N1 associated media stories) . This was shortly after the first major wave had peaked in week 27 . According to a survey conducted in week 29, 32.9 % of the participants (n=1050) were very or fairly worried about personally contracting the A/H1N1 virus. 78 Thereafter, the media attention decreased steadily to 15 A/H1N1 associated media stories in week 35, but increased slightly again and reached 28 media stories in week 44, when the first peak in the number of A/H1N1 deaths occurred (39 deaths). The curve then levelled out until week 8/201 0, when the last A/H1N1 media story was published, despite the second large wave of A/H1N1 cases and deaths. 3.2.6 Risk perception and human behavior In order t o monitor public risk perception in relation to the pandemic A/H1N1 outbreak, 36 telephone surveys wer e conducted in weekly intervals across the UK between 1 May 2009 and 10 January 2010. In mid -May, only 16 .6% (N=1173) of interviewees stated to be very or fairly worried about the possibility of catching pandemic A/H1N1. Along with the growing number of re ported pandemic A/H1N1 cases, the percentage of worried persons increased as well. By mid -June, 19 .3% (N=1050) of interviewees stated to be very or fairly worried about the possibility of catching pandemic A/H1N1 (Rubin et al. , 2010) . In mid-July, the percentage of worr ied persons had increased again. This time, 32.9% (N=1050) of interviewees stated to be very or fairly worried about the possibility of catching pandemic A/H1N1 (Rubin et al. , 2010) . According to a survey observing people\u00b4s attitude towards the pandemic vaccine conducted between 14 August and 13 September 2009, 31 .7% (N=5175) of respondents ranked the likelihood of getting vaccinated as very likely and 24 .4% as fairly likely (Rubin et al. ., 2010) In late November 2009, the Gallup Organization conducted a survey called the Eurobarome ter in the 27 EU Member States, as well as in Norway, Switzerland and Iceland to examine public opinion about influenza and pandemic A/H1N1. In the UK, 49% (N=1000) believed it was unlikely or rather unlikely that they would personally catch the A/H1N1infl uenza . Furthermore, 37% stated that is was not likely or not likely at all that they would get vaccinated against the pandemic A/H1N1 virus. Health professionals were the most trusted source to inform about pandemic A/H1N1. 91% mentioned that they trust he alth professionals mostly or completely (The Gallu p Organization, 2010) . 79 From 8 November 2009 to 4 April 2010, a survey was conducted in all 389 NHS Trusts (Acute, Mental Health, Ambulance, Primary Care, Care and Foundation Trusts) in England on a weekly basis in order to assess the uptake of the vacci nes among healthcare workers. The proportion of frontline healthcare workers vaccinated is illustrated in the turquoise curve in Figure 5. Same as for the number of vaccines administered in Denmark, the vaccine uptake increased sharply within the first weeks after the vaccine was available and leveled out later on at approximat ely 40 % from week 4 /2010 on (Sethi &Pebody 2010a) . The A/H1N1 vaccination program in England initially targeted persons, who are most at risk for serious illness or death. These are persons, who belong to the seasonal influenza clinical risk groups (all ages), all pregnant women and household contacts of the immunocompromised , but also healthy children aged 6 months to under five years from December 2009 onwards (Sethi & Pebody 2010b). In order to assess the vaccine uptake among the target groups, a surve y was conducted using data collected from a sentinel group of GP practices (around 40 %). The vaccination uptake in under 65 clinical risk groups is reflected in the green curve in Figure 5 and the vaccination uptake in 65 and over clinical risk groups in the light purple curve. In both groups, the vaccine uptake increases steadily until week 4 /2010 and then remains at a rather constant level. Overall, the national vacc ine uptake in patients aged under 65 years in clinical risk groups was 35.4% including pregnant women. In those aged 65 years an over in clinical risk groups, the national vaccine uptake was 40.4% (Sethi & Pebody 2010b). In August 2010, the VENICE consort ium conducted a web -based survey covering 27 European member states in addition to Norway and Iceland in order to estimate A/H1N1 vaccination coverage rates in different target groups and entire populations during the pandemic. For 22 countries, estimates on the vaccination coverage were provided. Table 6 shows the survey results for England. 80 Table 6: A/H1N1 vaccination coverage in different target groups and the entire population in England (Mereckiene et al., 2012) Vaccination coverage (%) Country Overall (n=22) a 6 months of age with chronic diseases and underlying conditions (n=9) Pregnant women (n=12) b Children (n=12) c Healthcare workers (n=13) d England NA 38 15 24 40 a Some countries recommended pandemic vaccine for some population groups but calculated overall vaccination coverage. b Pregnant women: all countries that provided vaccination coverage recommended vaccination to all pregnant women (with or without risk indication). c Groups for which vaccination coverage were measured: France, Iceland, Italy, Norway and Slovenia (n=5), 6months -<18years of age; England, 6 months -<5 years age; Finland, 15 years of age; Ireland, >6months -<15years or age; Luxembourg, at risk; Netherlands, 6 months -4years of age; Portugal, 6 months - 12 years of age. d Healthcare workers: Czech Republic, E ngland, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal (n=5) recommended pandemic vaccine to only healthcare workers with close contact with patients; Estonia recommended for healthcare work- ers with close contact with patient and with no contact with patients, but contact w ith potentially contaminated material; Hungary, Malta, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Slovakia (n=6) recommended pandemic vaccine to all healthcare workers. 3.3 Spain 3.3.1 Epidemiology and p rogress of the A/H1N1 pandemic The blue bars in Figure 6 illustrate the total number of A/H1N1 detections (sentinel and non - sentinel) during the A/H1N1 pandemic. In Spain, the first confirmed case was reported on 27 April 2009. By 11 May, the number of confirmed cases rose to 98 cases. Of these, 76 cases had a history of travel to Mexico (Surveillance Group for New Influenza A(H1N1) Virus Investigation and Control in Spain, 2009) . In late May, the first outbreak without travel 81 history w as observed at the Military Academy of Engineering in Hoyo de Manzanares indicating the start of community transmission of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus. The numbers of confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases increased constantly. By the end of June, Spain has repor ted 717 confirmed cases (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009b). On 1 July, Spain confirmed its first fatal case (European Centre for Disease Preven tion and Control, 2010a) , which raised the cumulative number of deaths in the EU to four (UK three cases, Spain one case) (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009v). The reported number of deaths from A/H1N1 per week is reflected in the red curve in Figure 6. In its Threat Assessment, published on 1 July, the ECDC announced the first isolation of an oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu\u00ae) resistant mutant A/H1N1 virus in Denmark. The virus was not a reassortant virus and was still susceptible to zanamivir (also kn own as Relenza\u00ae). There was no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to other persons. ECDC stated that this phenomenon is well -known in influenza viruses and emphasized the need for continued surveillance of this problem (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009u) . In July, numerous outbr eaks occurred, especially in summer camps, and the numbers of infections began to increase until week 29/2009 (Sierra Moros et al. , 2010) . As observed in Germany and the UK, transmission decreased as the summer progressed. In early autumn transmission accelerated again and numbers of det ections rose constantly. According to an ECDC risk assessment published on 20 July, 20 -30% of the population was expected to be affected over the first major wave of the pandemic. Clinical a ttack rates were expected to be highest in children and young ad ults. The estimate for h ospitalization rate s in Europe was 1 -2% and the case fatality rate was estimated to be 0.1 -0.2% of all clinical cases. ECDC stated that most cases experienced a mild and self -limiting illness, but people with chronic underlying medi cal conditions, pregnant women and young children were at higher 82 risk of experiencing severe disease and deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009w) . As of 4 August, Spain has reported 1538 confirmed cases to the ECDC. Spain has stopped laboratory testing of all suspected cases; therefore , the reported numbers severely underestimate the true figure in the two countries. So far, Spain has recorded 7 deaths from pandemic A/H1 N1 infection (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009aa) . The virus continued to spread in the country, but at a low level over the summer (see Figure 6). On 21 August, the ECDC published its planning assumptions for the first major wave of infection, which was expected to take place in the autumn and winter of 2009/2010. However, these planning assumptions did not differ from those published on 20 July (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ab) . In late September, the ECDC has red uced its planning assumption. This decision was based on experience from Southern Hemisphere countries . It became more apparent that most pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disease; therefore hospitalization and case fatality rates were revised downw ards (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ad) . In early autumn, the numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 in fections in Spain have started to increase again, indicating the beginning of the expect ed autumn/winter wave (see Figure 6). In Spain the autumn wave peaked in week 46/2009 reaching the weekly incidence rate of nearly 372 cases/ 100.000 population (Larrauri C\u00e1mara et al. , 2010) . In mid-November, the number of reported deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 in Spain reached 88 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ah) . In its 7th risk assessment issued on 6 November, the ECDC has revised its planning assumptions . The following EU rea sonable worst case planning assumptions for the first 83 year up to mid -May 2010 were published: clinical attack rate: up to 20% of population, hospitalization rate: up to 100 per 100.000 population and case fatality rate: up to 3 per 100.000 population (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ag) . The number of pandemic A/H1N1 infections decreased constantly in Spain. The end of the autumn wave was in early January 2010. Afterwards only sporadic case s have been reported (Larrauri C\u00e1mara et al. , 2010) . In mid-January, the number of reported deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 in Spain reached 271 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010b) . In Spain, the incidence rate was highest in the under 15 years of age group. The severity of the pandemic regarding lethality and mortality was characterized as mild with an estimated overall mortality rate of 0.43 deaths per 1000 pandemic cases. The 45 - 64 years age group showed the highest mortality rate, with 9.35 deaths per 1.000.000 population (Larrauri C\u00e1mara et a l., 2010) . In February 2010, evidence showed decreasing or low pandemic A/H1N1 activity in many countries, but the WHO Emergency Committee agreed that it was too early to conclude that the pandemic A/H1N1 virus has run its course. Thus, the pandemic in fluenza alert phase was not changed (World Health Organization, 2010a) . On 10 August 2010, the WHO Emergency Committee assessed the global situation again. This time the Committee concluded that the world was entering the post -pandemic period (World Health Organization, 2010c) . Altogether, the total number of reported deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 influenza across Spain was 348 (Ministerio de Sanidad, Politica Social e Igualdad, 2010a) . 3.3.2 Surveillance The Spanish influenza surveillance system (SISS) consists of sixteen Spanish regional sentinel networks and regional laboratories, including the Nation al Center of Microbiology at the Instit uto de Salud Carlos III (WHO National Influenza Centre) . In the 2008/2009 season, the system comprised over 500 general practitioners and 173 pediatricians and 84 covered nearly 2.1% of the population of the 16 autonomou s communities (ACs) in Spain. Each regional sentinel network entered data on influenza detections in a web -based application on a weekly basis and the National Centre of Epidemiology at the Instituto de Salud Carlos III in Madrid analyzed the data at centr al level. Pandemic A/H1N1 virus detections from non -sentinel sources (i.e. hospitals, cooperating laboratories) were also reported to the system (Larrauri et al. , 2011) . The data reported to the SISS were u sed to calculate weekly influenza incidence rates. For this calculation, the population in each sentinel network was used as the denominator (Larrauri C\u00e1mara et al. , 2010) . Since 1904, Influenza is a notifiable disease in Spain , but the specificity of this system is lower than the specificity of the SISS (Centro Nacional de Epidemiolog\u00eda. Inst ituto de Salud Carlos III, 2009 ). Therefore, only available data of the SISS have b een used to show the progress of the 2009/2010 A/H1N1 pandemic in Spain. Based on the situation in Mexico and the US, the Coordinating Centre for Health Alerts and Emergencies (CCAES) at the Spanish Ministry of Health and Social Policy issued a national epidemiologic alert on 24 April. National and regional public health authorities were asked to enhance surveillance and to report urgently any case of influenza -like illness and severe respiratory disease among people who traveled to Mexico or who had conta ct with a confirmed case of pandemic A/H1N1 infection (Surveillance Group fo r New Influenza A(H1N1) Virus Investigation and Control in Spain, 2009) . Following the declaration of a public health emergency o f international concern (PHEIC) , the Ministry of Health and Social Policy launched the National Plan for Preparedness and Response to an influenza pandemic, including the activation of the Surveillance Subcom mittee, which held its first meeting on 27 April. This committee was responsible for defining and agreeing the strategy of surveil lance, although all decisions had to be presented to the Public Health Commission for approval (Sierra Moros et al. , 2010) . Spain`s initial case definition was amended and finally adopted on 7 May, 2009, to accommodate to the EU case definition. The modification included the following changes: 85 the temperature defining fever w as increased from 37,5\u00ba C to 38\u00ba C and the incubation period was reduced from 10 to 7 days (Santa -Olalla Peralta, Cortes Garc\u00eda, Mart\u00ednez S\u00e1nchez, et al., 2010) . To gather epidemiological data of pandemic A/H1N1 infections, a case -based surveillance was implemented which differed from the usual flu surveillanc e maintained by the Spanish Influenza Surveillance System (Sierra Moros et al. , 2010) On 26 June, Spain modified its surveillance strategy. The Public Health Commission approved a strate gy based on 5 points, saying that: a case -based surveillance of severe cases should start, the influenza surveillance through the SISS should be maintained, monitoring of clusters of acute respiratory illness should be maintained, but a case-based notification was not required anymore and only the first cases had to be swabbed for laboratory confirm ation, monitoring of influenza or acute respirator y disease from the primary care comput erized database, as well as case-based monitoring of flu cases in the community should be maintained . In addition, the identification and monitoring of contacts and administration of prophylaxis to contacts was ceased . (Santa-Olalla S\u00e1nchez, et al. , 2010) . On 16 July, the WHO announced that countries with community -wide transmission are no longer required to forward regular reports of individual confirmed cases to the WHO, as the detectio n, laboratory -confirmation and investigation of all cases is extremely resource - intensive and not sustainable for these countries (World Health Organization, 2009k) . On 27 July, the Spanish Surveillance Subcommittee agreed on a surveillance strategy update that suppressed the case -based surveillance of cases in the community. One day later, this new strategy was approved by the Spanish Public Health Commission (Ministerio de Sanidad, Politica Social e Igualdad, 2010a; Sierra Moros et al. , 2010) . 86 On 9 September, th e Spanish Public Health Commission revised the surveillance strategy once again. According to the new strategy, the investigation of clusters of cases was only recommended in those cases deemed necessary to make a special intervention (Ministerio de Sanidad, Politica Social e Igualdad, 2010a) . On 4 December, the Spanish Surv eillance Subcommittee eased the reporting requirements for severe cases. Two month later, on 1st February, the case -based monitoring of severe cases was stopped in favor of weekly aggregated reports of severe pandemic A/H1N1 cases. On 1st April, this new reporting requirement was ceased as well. Additionally, the notification of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 related deaths was stopped (Ministerio de Sanidad, Politica Social e I gualdad, 2010a) . 87 Figure 6: Epidemiology, key events and media attention during the A/H1N1 pandemic in Spain Sour ces: Reported number of A/H1N1 cases per week: Centro Nacional de Epidemiolog\u00eda.

Number of A/H1N1 associated media stories: Media Tenor 88 3.3.3 Pandemic management strategy Initially, Spain employed a containment strategy. Measures focused on limiting transmission of the virus or delaying the spread in order to gain time to apply effective response measures. This strategy included the following public health measures: those w ho met the clinical and epidemiological case definition were assessed through swabbing and laboratory testing; cases were treated with antivirals within 48 hours after onset of symptoms and requested to isolate at home or in hospital (depending on their cl inical condition) for at least seven days. Contacts were additionally asked to self -isolate at home for ten days with restrictions on visits (Santa -Olalla Peralta, Cortes Garc\u00eda, Mart\u00ednez S\u00e1nchez, et al. , 2010) . In order t o avoid the introduction of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus through international air traffic, Spain started to meet all direct flights from Mexico at an early stage. Medical teams checked passengers and crew members on clinical symptoms and distributed information leaflets about pandemic infl uenza. In addition, contact details of passengers were collected to be able to inform them if it turned out that a person with confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 infection was aboard the same flight. Spain maintained this measure until 16 June. In Germany, t he infe ction control measures at the airports were kept up until week 35/2009 (D\u00e1vila Cornejo et al., 2010 ). School closures were not recommended as a means of reducing the spread of th e virus (Ministerio de Sanidad, Servicios Sociales e Igualdad, 2 009). On May 20, the Surveillance Sub committee in Spain changed the case and contact management strategy. It was agreed that a ntivirals would be given only to cases with severe disease, those with risk factors and contacts with risk factors. Whereas the i solation of case s should be maintained , the isolation of contacts was not considered to be necessary anymore (Santa -Olalla Peralta, Cortes Garc\u00eda, Mart\u00ednez S\u00e1nchez, et al. , 2010) . On 27 July, Spain moved from containment to mitigation, although response measures have already been changed towards a mitigation strategy in late June, i.e. contact tracing was ceased. Case -based reporting of cases in the community was stopped and antivir als were 89 only given to cases requiring hospitalization and to those at risk of complications (Ministerio de San idad, Politica Social e Igualdad, 2010b; Sierra Moros et al. , 2010) 3.3.4 Vaccination strategy As the new virus first emerged in April 2009, it was not possible to adjust the 2009/2010 seasonal influenza vaccine to this new influenza A/H1N1 strain (Robert Koch -Institu te, 2009c) . The production of a pandemic -specific vaccine takes four to six months and can only be started when the new strain has been isolated (Hine, 2010) . At the time Spain started to develop their vaccination strategy, the severit y and infectivity of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus was still uncertain. Thus, it was difficult to decide on the quantity of required vaccine (Hine, 2010; Marcic et al. , 2010) . On 13 May, the Public Health Commission in Spain adopted an estimate saying that vaccine for 40% of the population would be needed. O n the basis that two doses of vaccine per person were needed to achieve a sufficient immune response, the Public Health Commission planned to procure 36.6 million doses of pandemic vaccine (Ministerio de Sanidad, Politica Social e Igualdad, 2010b) . As initial supplies of pandemic vaccine were limited, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization recommended that the f ollowing groups should be prioritized for vaccination: health -care workers , pregnant women , individuals aged above six months with a chronic medical condition , healthy individuals aged between 15 years and up to 49 years , healthy children , healthy individu als aged between 50 years and up to 64 years and healthy individuals aged 65 years or above. The order of priority should be based on country -specific conditions (World Health Organization, 2009j) . In Spain, an agreement on priority groups for vaccination against pan demic A/H1N1 has been achieved on 31 August. The following population groups were considered to be priority groups for vaccination, but should not be prioritized in any order: health and social care workers, pregnant women, 90 people working in essential pub lic services (e.g. firefighters, policemen, workers at prisons, etc.), and individuals aged over six months in a clinical at -risk group. Clinical at -risk groups were considered to be the same as in the UK (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, e Igualdad, 2010b) . On 29 September, the European Commission authorized the first two pandemic vaccines Focetria\u00ae (Novartis) and Pandemrix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline) for use in all Member States of the European Union and in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009b) . On 6 October, the European Commission authorized a third pandemic vaccine, Celvapan\u00ae, for use in all EU Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009c) . On 16 November the Spanish vaccination program commenced (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009l) . Just in time for the start of the vaccination program the new pandemic vaccine Panenz a\u00ae was authorized in Spain. It has been authorized by a decentralized procedure in which national agencies of Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg have participated . Panenza\u00ae is a vaccine without an adjuvant and was administered to pregnan t women (Agencia 2009c) . Pandemrix\u00ae was recommended to be administered to adults aged between 18 and 60 years only. The first choice for the other age groups was Focetria\u00ae. The Spanish Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency (Agencia Espa\u00f1ol a de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios ; AEMPS recommended a one dose schedule for Pandemrix\u00ae and Focetria\u00ae for individuals aged over six months (Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios, 2009 d). 91 3.3.5 Communication In order to give a better overview, the information published during the pandemic is grouped around the themes: Communication related to personal protective measures, communication related to A/H1N1 treatment, communication related to pandemic management strategy , communication related to A/H1N1 vaccination and communication in the media. Communication related to personal protective measures On 24 April, the Spanish Ministry of Health and Social Policy published information on persona l protective measures for the public and for travelers on its website. The information aimed to raise early awareness of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus among the public and informed on personal protective measures, i.e. regular hand washing, respiratory hygiene and avoidance of close contacts with sick people (Surveillance Group for Ne w Influenza A(H1N1) Virus Investigation and Control in Spain, 2009) . In addition to the public information and advice on national level, the ECDC provided information on European level. On 27 April, the ECDC published the first general questions and a nswers on pandemic A/H1N1 virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . In May, the ECDC published two documents on personal protective measures and information for travelers. The documents described personal protective measures to reduce the risk of acquiring influenza, i.e. regular hand washing, respiratory hygiene, avoidance of close contacts and mass gatherings (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009k, 2009m, 2009n) . In mid -August, campaign \"Gripe A. La prevenci\u00f3n es la major medida\" started in Spain (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009a) . Therefore, the Ministry of Health and Social Policy has launched the information website \"informaciongripea.es\". This website provided information about the disease and advice on personal protective measures for th e general public. In addition, information and advice was made available to the public through posters, information leaflets, social networks and over the radio (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009a, 2012) . Besides the mainstream public information campaign, the Ministry of Health and Social Policy published tailored 92 information and guidance on preventive measures for families, schools and kindergartens (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009e, 2009f, 2009g) related to A/H1N1 treatment The use of antivirals in some groups involves particularities health professionals should know . Thus, on 8 May, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a guidance document on the use of the antiviral medicine Tamiflu in children under one year of age and the antivirals Tamiflu and Relenza in pregnant and breastfeeding women in the case of an influen za A/H1N1 pandemic. The EMA stated that in the event of a pandemic Tamiflu can be used to treat children under the age of one and both antivirals can be used to treat pregnant women, as the benefits of their use outweigh their risks (European Medicines Agency, 2009a) . In Spain, the following recommendations on the use of antivirals in children, pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding were published: zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae) or ose ltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) can be used in pregnant women , but zanamivir was recommended as first choice for treatment and prophylaxis, the preferred antiviral medicine for breastfeeding women is oseltamivir, children under the age of one year should only be treat ed with oseltamivir, post exposure prophylaxis for children under the age of one should only be offered after a thorough benefit -risk assessment (Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Medic amentos y Productos Sanitarios, 200 9a) Besides the guidance on the use of antivirals, the Spanish Ministry of Health published recommendations on the treatment of cases with severe acute respiratory failure, recommendations on the clinical management o f adults with pneumonia and recommendations on the treatment of pregnant women. The three documents aimed to inform health professionals on diagnostic tests, general and severe symptoms, antiviral treatment or the treatment of complications, and personal p rotective measures (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, . 93 On 18 August, the ECDC published general guidance on the use of antivirals during influenza pandemics. The document aimed to inform those deciding on antiviral use strategies about the effectiveness of antivirals, side effects of antivirals, priority group s for antiviral use and about necessary arrangements for antiviral delivery and administration (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009y) . In October, the Spanish Ministry of Health and Social Policy published two documents for health professionals. The first document a imed to inform health professionals on diagnostic procedures and the treatment of pandemic A/H1N1 infections. It contained recommendations regarding the criteria for hospitalization, the organization of care, the treatment with antivirals and personal prot ective measures (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009j) . The second document included recommendations on prevention and control measures in retirement homes. It informed on general hygiene measures, the mana gement of cases and on available pandemic vaccines (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009k) . Communication related to pandemic c ontrol measures On 19 May, the ECDC published a guidance document on case and contact management. The recommended measures did not differ from the measures alr eady applied in Germany, Spain and the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009o) . On 6 June, the ECDC published a guidance document on mitigation and containment strategies for national health authorities. ECDC stated that many public health measures are common in both strategies and the implementation of a mitigation strategy would mainly mean to move away from vigorous case finding and contact tracing. Further, the ECDC acknowledged that a containment strategy is very resource -intensive and therefore not a recommended infection control s trategy for human influenza beyond pandemic alert phase 4 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009r) . On 26 June, the WHO published a guidance document on public health measures to help countries manage the A/H1N1 pandemic. Besides giving general advice on response measures, the WHO provided add itional advice for countries with widespread community - 94 level transmission, for countries with no reported cases and for countries in transition. The WHO advised all countries to concentrate on mitigation measures, to prepare the health -care system for a hi gh volume of patients and to ensure antiviral medicine and vaccine supply. In addition, countries with widespread community -level transmission were advised to cease laboratory -testing of all cases, to reduce the pressure on the health -care system, to prima rily focus on the treatment of ill patients, and to consider school closures or the cancellation of mass gathering on a case -by-case basis. Countries with no reported cases were advised that they may consider entry screening at airports and contact tracing , but that these measures are resource intensive and of limited benefit to prevent the spread of the disease. Countries in transition were advised to start the same control measures as countries with widespread community -level transmission (World Health Organization, 2009a) . On 20 July, the ECDC gave scientific advice on reactive and proactive school closures in Europe. ECDC highlighted that there is no consensus on the benefits from proactive school closures ( school closure before transmission be tween the children occurs), but countries and schools were advised to at least have plans for reactive school closures (school closure when many children and/or staff are experiencing illness) . These plans should consider the following issues: recommended length of time of closure; the triggers for re -opening; how to sustain teaching and learning; and potential problems that may arise for parents, if they have to take time off work (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009x) . In mid -September, the ECDC published a document on public health m easures for policy and decision -makers (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . It provided scientific information on measures that may be applied to reduce the impact of influenza pandemics (i.e. bord er closures, entry restrictions, personal protective measures, social distancing measures, use of antivirals and vaccines) and aimed to help EU countries to decide on appropriate response measures (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009a) . 95 On 23 September, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 5th meeting and agreed on continuing the following recommendations proposed by the WHO Director -General: borders should not be closed and travel and trade should not be restricted, countries should intensify surveillance of unusual events and people who are ill should postpone international travel (World Health Organization, 2009n) . On 26 November, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 6th meeting and agreed that delaying international travel was no longer recommended for ill persons, because pandemic A/H1N1 infections were already widespread (World Health Organization, 2009p) . Communication related to A/H1N1v accination Referring to m edia reports that have displayed concern about the safety of pandemic vaccine, the WHO has issued a note on pandemic vaccine safety on 6 August. In this statement the WHO outlined the procedures for approval and licensing of vaccines and confirmed that these procedures are strict and do include safety and quality controls. The WHO also stated that the data on influenza vaccine safety collected during the last 60 years do not show a special safety issue. Nonetheless, the WHO advised countries to closely moni tor the safety and efficacy of the pandemic vaccine, as rare adverse events may only occur when large numbers of people got vaccinated (World Health Organization, 2009l) . On 13 August, the ECDC published a document on the use of influenza pandemic v accines during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The document aimed to inform those deciding on vaccination policies in the European countries on vaccine use and options for prioritization in order to maximize the benefit of available vaccine (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009z) Together with the start of the vaccination program, the public information campaign was launched in Spain. Information and advice was accessible on government websites and made available to the general public through leaflets (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit et al. , Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009l) . 96 On 5 November, the Medicine s and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK published its first adverse reaction analysis on pandemic vaccines. In this report, the MHRA stated that there have been no new safety issues identified and that the benefits for Celvapan\u00ae and Pa ndemrix\u00ae still outweigh their risks (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, 2009b) . On European level, information on vaccination was provided by th e ECDC. In November the ECDC published questions and answers on vaccines for health professionals and for the general public on its website (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009b, 2009c, 2010a) . On 19 November, the WHO issued a briefing note on pandemic vaccines in which the safety of the vaccines was reaffirmed (World Health Organization, 2009o) . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) did hold the same opinion. In a press release published on 20 November, the EMA reasserted the efficacy an d safety of pandemic vaccines. Further, the EMA revised its advice on vaccine schedules and published the following recommendations: Pandemrix\u00ae and Focetria\u00ae may be used as a single dose in adults (18 -60 years) and in children and adolescents (Focetria\u00ae: f rom the age of 9 years; Pandemrix\u00ae: from the age of 10 years). Individuals aged over 60 years may also receive one dose of Pandemrix\u00ae, but younger children and immunocompromised people should receive two doses (Europe an Medicines Agency, 2009c) . Between December 2009 and August 2010, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published regular updates on safety monitoring of vaccines and medicines used during the pandemic (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . In its update on pandemic medicines of 18 December, the EMA reaffirmed that the available data on the three pandemic vaccines and Tamiflu \u00ae showed no unexpected serious safety issues (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . On 21 December, the Span ish Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency (Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios ; AEMPS ) issued official 97 recommendations on the vaccination program. This document informed health professionals on the priority groups for vaccination, th e specific pandemic vaccines and on aspects for vaccine administration (Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios, the media The number of A/H1N1 related media stories published in the main news TV show ( TVE Telediario ), two important daily newspapers ( El Pais, 20 minutos ) and one of the main weekly newspapers ( Tiempo, internet version ) is illustrated in Figure 6 (purple curve). This curve is rather similar to the curve in Germ any and in Czech Republic . However, it shows one major peak and two rather small ones over the time of the pandemic (week 14/2009 - week 14/2010). The first peak was also reached in week 18 (83 A/H1N1 associated media stories), when the WHO declared the pa ndemic phase 4 and shortly after, the pandemic phase 5. In this week, Spain also reported its first laboratory -confirmed A/H1N1 case. After this peak, the media attention decreased sharply, although not as sharply as in Germany and Czech Republic, to 19 A/ H1N1 associated media stories in week 20. In this week, the first confirmed tertiary case was registered in Spain. In week 24, when the WHO declared the pandemic phase 6, 15 A/H1N1 associate d media stories were published. The media attention remained rathe r low until week 31. From week 25 to week 29, the number of A/H1N1 cases increased in Spain . The number of A/H1N1 related articles started to rise again and reached the first smaller peak in week 36 (29 A/H1N 1 associated media stories). In the same week, the priority groups for vaccination have been agreed on. The second minor peak was reached in week 46 (2 3 A/H1N1 related media stories). This was the time, when the number of new A/H1N1 cases was highest during the pandemic. Thereafter , the media attention remained at a rather low level until week 14 in 2010. Figure 7 shows the results from the Google Flu Trends analysis for Spain from July to June for the 2009/2010 A/H1N1 as wel l as for the 2013/2014 season. Compared to other European countries, Spain was affected early by the A/H1N1 pandemic. The first smaller A/H1N1 wave already started in mid -June. The number of influenza -associated web -searches also started to in crease from minimal to low from mid -June on. Thereafter, the number of influenza -associated search queries started to rise again and reached a close to moderate 98 level in September. In Spain, the major A/H1N1 wave began in mid -September. In November, the fr equency of influenza -associated web searches peaked and was in between high and very high. This was also the time, when the highest number of new A/H1N1 cases was registered (week 46, see Figure 6). Thereafter, number of influenza -associated web searches decreased and remained at minimal to low level from January 2010 on. The same holds true for the number of A/H1N1 cases. Figure 7: Search activity in Google for influenza like illness (Spain) 3.3.6 Risk perception and human behavior In Spain, a study with two waves of anonymous cross -sectional computer -assisted telephone interviews was conducted in order to assess the perception of A/H1N1 pandemic and potential preventive measures adopted by the general population . The first wave of the study took place during the pandemic peak (week 43 -46/2009) and the second covered the pandemic declin ing phase (week 47/2009 - 4/2010). In the first survey, 79.5% of the respondents reported to have adopted at least one of the preventive measures recommended by the Spanish Ministry of Health (respiratory hygiene and/or hand washing more frequently). This proportion was significantly lower in the declining phase of the pandemic (74.6%). Several factors were associated with the adoption of preventive measures recommended by the Spanish Ministry of Health, especially a high concern to personally be infected w ith A/H1N1 as well as a high perception of the effectiveness of the preventive Very high High Moderate Low Minimal Spain :Nationwide 99 measures and the usefulness of the information provided by the government (Ag\u00fcero et al. 2011) . In late November 2009 , the Gallup Organization conducted a survey called the Eurobarometer in the 27 EU Member States, as well as in Norway, Switzerland and Iceland to examine public opinion about influenza and pandemic A/H1N1. 49% (N=1003) of Spanish interviewees believed it was unlikely or rather unlikely that they would personally catch the A/H1N1influenza . Furthermore, 66% stated that is was not likely or not likely at all that they would get vaccinated against the pandemic A/H1N1 virus. Health professionals were the most trusted source to inform about pandemic A/H1N1. 86% mention ed that they trust health professionals mostly or completely (The Gallup Organization, 2010) . In August 2010, the VENICE consortium conducted a web -based survey covering 27 European member states in addition to Norway and Iceland in order to estimate A/H1N1 vaccination coverage rates in different targ et groups and entire populations during the pandemic. For 22 countries, estimates on the vaccination coverage were provided. Table 7 shows the survey results for Spain. Table 7: A/H1N1 vaccination coverage in different target groups and the entire population in Spain (Mereckiene et al ., 2012) Vacc ination coverage (%) Country Overall (n=22) a 6 months of age with chronic diseases and underlying conditions (n=9) Pregnant women (n=12) b Children (n=12) c Healthcare workers (n=13) d Spain 27 24 9 NA 12 a Some countries recommended pandemic vaccine for some population groups but calculated overall vaccination coverage. 100 b Pregnant women: all countries that provided vaccination coverage recommended vaccination to all pregnant women (with or without risk indication). c Groups for which vaccination cover age were measured: France, Iceland, Italy, Norway and Slovenia (n=5), 6months -<18years of age; England, 6 months -<5 years age; Finland, 15 years of age; Ireland, >6months -<15years or age; Luxembourg, at risk; Netherlands, 6 months -4years of age; Por tugal, 6 months - 12 years of age. d Healthcare workers: Czech Republic, England, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal (n=5) recommended pandemic vaccine to only healthcare workers with close contact with patients; Estonia recommended for healthcare work- ers with cl ose contact with patient and with no contact with patients, but contact with potentially contaminated material; Hungary, Malta, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Slovakia (n=6) recommended pandemic vaccine to all healthcare workers. 3.4 Czech Republic 3.4.1 Epidemiology and p rogress of the A/H1N1 pandemic The blue bars in Figure 8 represent the number of new A/H1N1 cases per week in Czech Republic. On 25 May, the Czech Republic reported its first laboratory -confirmed case of pandemic A/H1N1 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009q) . In its risk assessment update on 20 May, the ECDC again reported a continuing lack of data on parameters needed for right risk assessment. The EC DC considered available data and stated that the pandemic A/H1N1 infections have been generally mild in Europe. Now there was more evidence that the virus was able to spread easily from one person to another and that it preferentially infected younger age groups. ECDC concluded that the spread of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus will continue (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009p) . Similar to the other countries, Czech Republic saw two wav es of the influenza A /H1N1 pandemic in 2009 . The first wave occurred in the summer , surrounding week 32/2009. In the s econd wave commencing in week 44/2009 , the infection spread effectively. This autumn wave peaked around week 51/2009 lasted until week 4/ 2010 (see Figure 8). In Czech Republic , the number of pandemic A/H1N1 cases has increased sharply until the peak of the first wave in week 32/2009 (see Figure 8). In its Threat Assessment, published on 1 July, the ECDC announced the first isolation of an oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu\u00ae) resistant mutant A/H1N1 virus in Denmark. The virus was not a reassortant virus and was still susceptible to zanamivir (also kn own as Relenza\u00ae). 101 There was no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to other persons. ECDC stated that this phenomenon is well -known in influenza viruses and emphasized the need for continued surveillance of this problem (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009u) . According to an ECDC ri sk assessment published on 20 July, 20 -30% of the population was expected to be affected over the first major wave of the pandemic. Clinical a ttack rates were expected to be highest in children and young adults. The estimate for h ospitalization rate s in Europe was 1 -2% and the case fatality rate was estimated to be 0.1 -0.2% of all clinical cases. ECDC stated that most cases experienced a mild and self -limiting illness, but people with chronic underlying medical conditions, pregnant women and young children were at higher risk of experiencing severe disease and deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009w) . Similar to other countries, the virus continued to spread in Czech Repub lic, but at a low level over the summer (see Figure 8). On 21 August, the ECDC published its planning assumptions for the first major wave of infection, which was ex pected to take place in the autumn and winter of 2009/2010. However, these planning assumptions did not differ from those published on 20 July (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2 009ab) . In late September, the ECDC has reduced its planning assumptions. This decision was based on experience from Southern Hemisphere countries . It became more apparent that most pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disease; therefore hospitalization and case fatality rates were revised downwards (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Contro l, 2009ad) . In early autumn, the numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 infectio ns have started to increase again, indicating the beginning of the expected autumn/winter wave. In the Czech Republic , the second wave peaked around week 51 /2009 . On 26 October, the Cz ech Republic reported the first fatal case due to pandemic A/H1N1 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and 102 Control, 2009af) . The reported number of confirmed deaths from A/H1N1 is show n as red curve in Figure 8. In its 7th risk assessment issued on 6 November, the ECDC has revised its planning assumptions . The following EU reasonable worst case pl anning assumptions for the first year up to mid -May 2010 were published: clinical attack rate: up to 20% of population, hospitalization rate: up to 100 per 100.000 population and case fatality rate: up to 3 per 100.000 population (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ag) . The number of pandemic A/H1N1 infections decreased constantly in the Czech Republic. The end of the autumn wave was in end of January 2010. Afterwards only sporadic cases have been reported (see Figure 8). In m id-January 2010 the number of deaths had climbed up to 83 people in the Czech Republic (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010c) and reached a total of 98 by the end of March 2010 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010e) . In February 2010, evidence showed decreasing or low pandemic A/H1N1 activity in many countries, but the WHO Emergency Committee agreed that it was too early t o conclude that the pandemic A/H1N1 virus has run its course. Thus, the pandemic influenza alert phase was not changed (World Health Organization, 2010a) . On 10 August 2010, the WHO Emergency Committee assessed the global situation again. This time the Committee concluded that the world was entering the post -pandemic period (World Health Organization, 2010c) . 3.4.2 Surveillance In the Czech Republic, the surveillance system to monitor influenza and other viral acute respiratory infections was active throughout the year and used the Europe an Union case definition for influenza. Data were collected on a weekly basis and analyzed at national level. The information was provided to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Due to the occurrence of increased numbers of severe influenza cases during the pandemic in 2009, the Regional Public Health 103 Authorities started, on request of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic , to introduce a surveillance system for infl uenza -related hospitalizations. This system collected case - based information about hospitalized patients with influenza infections (Kyncl, Havlickova, Nagy, Jirincova, & Piskova, 2013) . On 16 July, the WHO announced that countries with community -wide transmissio n are no longer required to forward regular reports of individual confirmed cases to the WHO, as the detection, laboratory -confirmation and investigation of all cases is extremely resource - intensive and not sustainable for these countries (World Health Or ganization, 2009k) . 104 Figure 8: Epidemiology , key events and media attention during the A/H1N1 pandemic in Czech Republic Sources: Number of new A/H1N1 number of confirmed A/H1N1 deaths was calculated based on the daily reports of ECDC. Vaccination coverage: Mereckiene et al. (2012): Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination policies and coverage in Europe. Euro Surveillance , 17(4). Number of A/H1N1 associated media stor ies: Media Tenor . 105 3.4.3 Pandemic management strategy For containing the spread of the A/H1N1 virus, the Czech Ministry of Health asked persons experiencing any of the typical flu symptoms to isolate at home for at least seven days after the onset of symptoms, if no underlying chronic illness was present. Contact with other persons was supposed to be avoided. Immediate medical attention was recommended for persons from at -risk groups for a complicated disease cour se, who experience basic symptoms of suspected flu -like illness. Risk groups included pregnant women in the higher state of pregnancy, children under the age of 24 months, adults aged 65 and older, people with certain chronic medical conditions (e.g. affec ting lung, heart or kidney, diabetes, and cancer) and people with severe obesity (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009a , Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009 e). Treatment with antivirals such as Tamiflu was recommended within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms (Mini sterstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009f ). About a potential preventive use of Tami flu or Relenza the treating physicians was in charge of deciding according to the individual risk ( Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009a ). For an uncomplicated disease course, it was recommended to stay in bed and control symptoms with over -the-counter medication. In case of more severe symptoms such as significant headaches, br eathing difficulties and increased shortness of breath, it was recom mended to contact a physician. Persons with underlying major diseases such as diabetes or cardiovascular diseases were asked to contact their doctor before travelling and to avoid close co ntact with sick people during their travels. In case of fever and flu -like symptoms after returning from travels, persons were ask to immediately contact the doctor who was supposed to follow national health recommendations accordingly (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009a) . 3.4.4 Vaccination strategy As initial supplies of pandemic vaccine were limited, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunizat ion recommended that the following groups should be prioritized for v accination: health -care workers, pregnant women, individuals aged above 106 six months w ith a chronic medical condition, healthy individuals aged between 15 years and up to 49 years , healthy children, healthy individuals aged betw een 50 years and up to 64 years and healthy individuals aged 65 years or above. The order of priority should be based on country -specific conditions (World Health Organization, 2009j) . On 21 August, the Czech Republic decided to buy 1 million doses of Pandemrix from GlaxoSmithKline . First deliveries were expected in week 48/2009 (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009c ). On 29 September, the European Commission authorized the first two pandemic vaccines Focetria\u00ae (Novartis) and Pandemrix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline) for use in all Member States of the European Union and in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009b) . On 6 October, the European Commission authorized a third pandemic vaccine, Celvapan\u00ae, for use in all EU Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009c) . The Euro pean Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended a two dose schedule for all three authorized vaccines (European Medicines Agency, 2009b) . On 23 November the Czech Republic started its vaccination program (O'Flanagan et al.., 2011) . Three days later the decision on risk groups and vaccine schedules were published. The pandemic vaccine was recommended for the following groups: Individuals with chronic conditions (e.g chronic heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chro nic kidney disease, immunocompromised person), Individuals performing essential public services and Healthcare workers. For these groups listed above a single -dose vaccine schedule was recommended, except for immunocompromised individuals where the vaccin e was administered in a two -dose schedule (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009c, 2009j) . 107 3.4.5 Communication In order to give a better overview, the information published during the pandemic is grouped around the themes: communication related to personal protective measures, communication related to A/H1N1 treatment, communication related to pandemic control measures , communication r elated to A/H1N1 vaccination and communication in the media. Communication related to personal protective measures The E CDC provided information on European level. On 27 April, the ECDC published the first general questions and answers on pandemic A/H1N1 virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . In May, the ECDC published two documents on personal protective measures and information for travelers. The documents described personal protective measures to reduce the risk of acquiring influenza, i.e. regular hand washing, respiratory hygiene, avoida nce of close contacts and mass gatherings (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009k, 2009m, 2009n) . On 21 May t ravel recommendations and recommendations on protective measures were published by the Czech Ministry of Health. This leaflet was based o n information given by the ECDC. It informed about the symptoms of pandemic A/H1N1 infection and provided instructions on general hygiene measures to avoid pandemic A/H1N1 infection (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009a) . On 27 August, the Ministry of Health published a document on personal protective measures based on ECDC material. This document aimed to answer frequently asked questions on pandemic A/H1N1. I t informed about symptoms of pandemic influenza A/H1N1, ways of transmission, general hygiene measures, risk groups, and control measures (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009d) . About three weeks later, on 16 September, a poster on preventive measures was published (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009e) . 108 Communication related to A/H1N1 treatment The use of antivirals in some groups involves parti cularities health professionals should know . Thus, on 8 May, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a guidance document on the use of the antiviral medicine Tamiflu in children under one year of age and the antivirals Tamiflu and Relenza in pregnant and breastfeeding women in the case of an influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. The EMA stated that in the event of a pandemic Tamiflu can be used to treat children under the age of one and both antivirals can be used to treat pregnant women, as the benefits of thei r use outweigh their risks (European Medicines Agency, 2009a) . On 31 July, the Ministry of Health published information on Relenza for health professionals. This information was based on advice from the European Medicines Agency and contained the following recommendations: Relenza in the current situation was indicated for the treatment of diseases of proven influenza virus A (H1N1) in adults, adolescents and children over 5 years of age. It was not intended for prophylactic use. Treatment should have been initiated as soon as possible after the outbreak of flu symptoms and within 48 hours of onset of symptoms in adults and within 36 hours of onset of symptoms in children (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009b) . On 18 August, the ECDC published general guidance on the use of antivirals during influenza pandemics. The document aimed to inform those deciding on antiviral use strategies about the effectiveness of antivirals, side effects of antivirals, priority groups for antiviral use and about necessary arrangements for antiviral delivery and administration (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009y) . On 23 September, a document providing information on antivirals for health professionals was published. This document contained information on the use and dosage of antivirals, contraindications and side effects. According to this document, the prophylactic use of antivirals was not recommended (Ministerstvo zd ravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009f) . 109 On 16 November an information letter was sent to GP that informed about the start of the vaccination program and the Tamiflu distribution process . Tamiflu was not recommended for the prophylactic treatment, but as antiviral trea tment for (hospitalized) patients with severe disease course (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009g) . On 20 November the Ministry of Health published informa tion on the amount of antivirals distributed to hospitals and recommended dosage of antivirals for children and adults (Minist erstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009h) . Communication related to pandemic control measures On 19 May, the ECDC published a guidance document on case and contact management. The recommended measures did not differ from the measures already applied in Germany, Spain and the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009o) . On 6 June, the ECDC published a guidance document on mitigation and containment strategies for national health authorities. ECDC stated that many public health measures are common in both strategies and the implementation of a miti gation strategy would mainly mean to move away from vigorous case finding and contact tracing. Further, the ECDC acknowledged that a containment strategy is very resource -intensive and therefore not a recommended infection control strategy for human influe nza beyond pandemic alert phase 4 (European Centre for Diseas e Prevention and Control, 2009r) . On 26 June, the WHO published a guidance document on public health measures to help countries manage the A/H1N1 pandemic. Besides giving general advice on response measures, the WHO provided additional advice for count ries with widespread community - level transmission, for countries with no reported cases and for countries in transition. The WHO advised all countries to concentrate on mitigation measures, to prepare the health -care system for a high volume of patients an d to ensure antiviral medicine and vaccine supply. In addition, countries with widespread community -level transmission were advised to cease laboratory -testing of all cases, to reduce the pressure on the health -care system, to primarily 110 focus on the treatm ent of ill patients, and to consider school closures or the cancellation of mass gathering on a case -by-case basis. Countries with no reported cases were advised that they may consider entry screening at airports and contact tracing, but that these measure s are resource intensive and of limited benefit to prevent the spread of the disease. Countries in transition were advised to start the same control measures as countries with widespread community -level transmission (World Health Organization, 2009a) . On 20 July, the ECDC gave scientific advice on reactive and proactive school closures in Europe. ECDC highlighted that there is no consensus on the benefits from proactive school closures ( school closure before transmission be twee n the children occurs), but countries and schools were advised to at least have plans for reactive school closures (school closure when many children and/or staff are experiencing illness) . These plans should consider the following issues: recommended leng th of time of closure; the triggers for re -opening; how to sustain teaching and learning; and potential problems that may arise for parents, if they have to take time off work (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009x) . In mid -September, the ECDC published a document on public health measures for policy and decision -makers (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . It provided scientific information on measures that may be applied to reduce the impact of influenza pandemics (i.e. border closures, entry restrictions, p ersonal protective measures, social distancing measures, use of antivirals and vaccines) and aimed to help EU countries to decide on appropriate response measures (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009a) . On 23 September, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 5th meeting and agreed on continuing the following recommendations proposed by the WHO Director -General: borders should not be closed and travel and trade should not be restricted, countries should intensify surveillance of unusual events and 111 people who are ill should postpone international travel (World Health Organization, 2009n) . On 26 November, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 6th meeting and agreed that delaying international travel was no longer recommended for ill persons, because pandemic A/H1N1 infections were already widespread (World Health Organization, 2009p) . Communication related to A/H1N1 vaccination Referring to media reports that have displayed concern about the safety of pandemic vaccine, the WHO has issued a note on pandemic vaccine safety on 6 August. In this statement the WHO outlined the procedures for approval and licensing of vaccines and confirmed that these procedures are strict and do include safety and quality controls. The WHO also stated that the data on influenza vaccine safety collected during the last 60 years do not show a special safety issue. Nonetheless, the WHO advised countries to closely mon itor the safety and efficacy of the pandemic vaccine, as rare adverse events may only occur when large numbers of people got vaccinated (World Health Organization, 2009l) . On 13 August, the ECDC published a document on the use of influenza pandemic vaccines during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The document aimed to inform those deciding on vaccination policies in the European countries on vaccine use and options for prioritization in order to maximize the benefit of available vaccine (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009z) . On European level, information on vaccination was provided by the ECDC. In November , the ECDC published questions and answers on vaccines for health professionals and for the general public on its website (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009b, 2009c, 2010a) . On 19 November, the WHO issued a briefing note on pandemic vaccines in which the safety of the vaccines was reaffirmed (World Health Organization, 2009o) . The European 112 Medicines Agency (EMA) did hold the same opinion. In a press release published on 20 November, the EMA reasserted the efficacy an d safety of pandemic vaccines. Further, the EMA revised its advice on vaccine schedules and published the following recommendations: Pandemrix\u00ae and Focetria\u00ae may be used as a single dose in adults (18 -60 years) and in children and adolescents (Focetria\u00ae: f rom the age of 9 years; Pandemrix\u00ae: from the age of 10 years). Individuals aged over 60 years may also receive one dose of Pandemrix\u00ae, but younger children and immunocompromised people should receive two doses (Europe an Medicines Agency, 2009c) . On 20 November, information on the vaccination strategy, general conditions for the distribution and storage of vaccine, and the risk groups was published on the website of the Czech Ministry of H ealth (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009i) . On 9 December, the Ministry of health published information on vaccination for the general public. This information was based on the ECDC material on vaccination (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009k) . Between December 2009 and August 2010, the European Medici nes Agency (EMA) published regular updates on safety monitoring of vaccines and medicines used during the pandemic (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . In its update on pandemic medicines of 18 December, the EMA reaffirmed that the available da ta on the three pandemic vaccines and Tamiflu \u00ae showed no unexpected serious safety issues (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . Communication in the media The number of A/H1N1 associated media stories published in the main news TV show (CTV Udalosti), two important daily newspapers (Lidove Noviny, Blesk) and one of the main weekly newspa pers (Respekt) is shown in Figure 8 (purple curve). This curve is similar to the curve in Germany as it also has two major peaks over the time of the pandemic ( week 14/2009 - week 14/2010) . The first peak was also reached in week 18 (96 A/H1N1 associated media stories), when the WHO declared the pandemic phase 4 and shortly after, 113 the pandemic phase 5. Thereafter, the media attention declined sharply and rose again slightly, when the first laboratory -confirmed case of A/H1N1 in Czech Republic occurred in week 22 (28 A/H1N1 associated media stories). In week 24, when the WHO declared the pandemic phase 6, 21 A/H1N1 associated media stories were published. The media attent ion remaine d rather low between week 26 and week 39. This was the time of the first wave of A/H1N1 in Czech Republic. The number of A/H1N1 related media stories rose to 61 stories in week 45. The first confirmed A/H1N1 death had occurred in week 44. After week 45, the media attention declined sharply, but reached the second peak in week 48 (64 A /H1N1 associated media stories). In this week, the Czech Republic decided on the vaccine schedule as well as priority groups and started the vaccination program. Af ter this second peak, which was approximately halfway through the second A/H1N1 wave, the media attention remained at a rather low level until week 14 in 2010. 3.4.6 Risk perception and human behavior In late November 2009 , the Gallup Organization conducted a su rvey called the Eurobarometer in the 27 EU Member States, as well as in Norway, Switzerland and Iceland to examine public opinion about influenza and pandemic A/H1N1. 61% (N=1002) of Czech interviewees believed it was unlikely or rather unlikely that they would personally catch the A/H1N1influenza . Furthermore, 47% stated that is was not likely or not likely at all that they would get vaccinated against the pandemic A/H1N1 virus. Health professionals were the most trusted source to inform about pandemic A/H 1N1. 83% mentioned that they trust health professionals mostly or completely (The Gallup Organization, 2010) In August 2010, the VENICE consortium conducted a web -based survey covering 27 European member states in addition to Norway and Iceland in order to estimate A/H1N1 vaccination coverage rates in different target groups and entire populations during the pandemic. For 22 countries, estimates on the vaccination coverage were provided. In Czech Republic, the vaccination program was implemented from the end of November 2009 until the end of May 2010. The country signed a contract to purchase one million 114 Pandemrix pandemic vaccines, of which approximately two thirds were planned to be used for chronically ill people and pregnant women and one third for health professionals and state authorities. S ince these groups did not show much interest in the vaccination, it was offered to the general population on a free basis (Tom\u00e1 kov\u00e1 et al 2012) . However, the uptake of pandemic vaccine was very low in Czech Republic with an overall vaccine coverage of onl y 0,6% and 7% among healthcare workers (see Table 8). Table 8: A/H1N1 vaccination coverage in different target groups and the entire population in Czech Republic (Mereckiene et al ., 2012) Vaccination coverage (%) Country Overall (n=22) a 6 months of age with chronic diseases and underlying conditions (n=9) Pregnant women (n=12) b Children (n=12) c Healthcare workers (n=13) d Czech Republic 0.6 NA 0 NA 7 a Some countries recommended pandemic vaccine for some population groups but calculated overall vaccination coverage. b Pregnant women: all countries that provided vaccination coverage recommended vaccination to all pregnant women (with or without risk indication). c Groups for which vaccination coverage were measured: France, Iceland, Italy, Norway and Slovenia (n=5), 6months -<18years of age; England, 6 months -<5 years age; Finland, 15 years of age; Ireland, >6months -<15years or age; Luxembourg, at risk; Netherlands, 6 months -4years of age; Portugal, 6 months - 12 years of age. d Healthcare workers: Czech Republic, E ngland, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal (n=5) recommended pandemic vaccine to only healthcare workers with close contact with patients; Estonia recommended for healthcare work- ers with close contact with patient and with no contact with patients, but contact w ith potentially contaminated material; Hungary, Malta, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Slovakia (n=6) recommended pandemic vaccine to all healthcare workers. 115 The attitudes of students from two Czech universities to A/H1N1 as well as influenza vaccination were assessed in a survey . This study included 343 questionnaires filled out by randomly sel ected students from the medi cal faculties of Univers ity of Ostrava and of Masaryk University in Brno from November to December 2010 . The participants rated the risk of personally get ting infected with A/H1N1 as 3.8 on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. Women perceived a higher risk than men (p<0.001). 9% of the students considered some of the recommended preventive measures, which are beyond usual measures like hand washing. Most commonly, the applied measures included travel restrictions to areas with a high disease frequency, reduction of social conta cts or avoiding public crowds. The interest in the vaccination against A/H1N1 among the students was rather low, since 5% of the respondents wanted to get vaccinated. 3% of the participants were vaccinated when the vaccine was available. As a reason for th e low interest in th e A/H1N1 vaccination the low perception of its importance was mentioned. This reason was stated by 56% of the students. Contradictory information about the vaccination in the media is considered as another reason by the authors for the generally low vaccination uptake rates in Czech Republic (Tom\u00e1 kov\u00e1 et al 2012). 3.5 Denmark 3.5.1 Epidemiology and progress of the A/H1N1 pandemic The blue bars in Figure 9 show the number of A/H1N1 cases per week in Denmark. The first laboratory confirmed A/H1N1 case was reported on 1st May in Denmark . This person was infected in New York and came back to Denma rk on 29 April (National Board of He alth, 2009e) . In its risk assessment update on 20 May, the ECDC again reported a continuing lack of data on parameters needed for right risk assessment. The ECDC considered available data and stated that the pandemic A/H1N1 infections have been genera lly mild in Europe. Now there was more evidence that the virus was able to spread easily from one person to another and that it preferentially infected younger age groups. ECDC concluded that the spread of the 116 pandemic A/H1N1 virus will continue (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009p) . On 11 June, the WHO raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 6, declaring a pandemic (World Health Organization, 2009h) . The severity of t he pandemic was considered to be moderate by the WHO (World Health Organization, 2009i) . As of 11 June , Denmark has reported 11 cases of A/H1N1 , all of which have been relatively mild. By then, i nfection in Denmark was still limited to persons who ha d been abroad and in some cases t heir immediate contacts (National Board of Health, 2009g) . In its Thre at Assessment, published on 1 July, the ECDC announced the first isolation of an oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu\u00ae) resistant mutant A/H1N1 virus in Denmark. The virus was not a reassortant virus and was still susceptible to zanamivir (also known as Rele nza\u00ae). There was no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to other persons. ECDC stated that this phenomenon is well -known in influenza viruses and emphasized the need for continued surveillance of this problem (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009u) . According to an ECDC risk assessment published on 20 July, 20 -30% of the population was expected to be affected over the first major wave of the pandemic. Clinical a ttack rates were expected to be highest in children and young adults. The estimate for h ospitalization rate s in Europe was 1 -2% and the case fatality rate was estimated to be 0.1 -0.2% of all clinical cases. ECDC stated that most cases experienced a mild and self -limiting illness, but people with chronic underlying medical conditions, pregnant women and young children were at highe r risk of experiencing severe disease and deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009w) . Similar to the UK, Germany and Spain, Denmark saw two waves of the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009 . The first wave in the summer , surrounding week 30 was mostly due to imported cases of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 and only limited community transmission occurred (M\u00f8lbak et al., 2011) . 117 The virus continued to spread, but at a low level over the summer (see Figure 9). On 3 September, Denmark reported the f irst death from pandemic A/H1N1 infection of a Danish citizen in Norway (National Board of Health, 2009i) . The reported number of confirmed A/H1N1 deaths is illustrated in Figure 9 (red curve). On 21 August, the ECDC published its planning assumptions for the first major wave of infection, which was expected to take place in the autumn and winter of 2009/2010 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ab) . In late September, the ECDC has reduced its planning assumption. This decision was based on experience from Southern Hemisphere countries . It became more apparent that most pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disease; therefore hospitalization and case fatality rates were revised downwards (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Contro l, 2009ad) . In early autumn, the numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 infectio ns have started to increase again, indicating the beginning of the expected autumn/winter wave. In the Denmark , the second wave peaked in week 46/2009 (see Figure 9). In its 7th risk assessment issued on 6 November, the ECDC has revised its planning assumptions . The following EU reasonable worst case planning assumptions for the first year up to mid -May 2010 were published: clinical attack rate: up to 20% of population, hospitalization rate: up to 100 per 100.000 population and case fatality rate: up to 3 per 100.000 population (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ag) . The number of pandemic A/H1N1 infections decreased constantly in Denmark. The end of the autumn wave was in early January 2010. In Feb ruary 2010, evidence showed decreasing or low pandemic A/H1N1 activity in many countries, but the WHO Emergency Committee agreed that it was too early to conclude that 118 the pandemic A/H1N1 virus has run its course. Thus, the pandemic influenza alert phase w as not changed (World Health Organization, 2010a) . On 10 August 2010, the WHO Emergency Committee assessed the global situation again. This time the Committee concluded that the world was entering the post -pandemic period (World Health Organization, 2010c) . Overall, only 5% of the Danish population was infected. According to estimates approx. 300,000 Danes have had a clinical infection with the new H1N1 influenza virus (Andersen, 2010a) . The highest risk was observed in the age group 5 -14 years. Of these, 15 % were infected, followed by ch ildren under the age of 5 (8%) and 15-64 year -olds (4%) . Like in the other countries, e lderly people were less affected due to the fact that most of them were already immunized (M\u00f8lbak et al. ., 2011) . In total, 53 patients with influenza A /H1N1 infection were admitted to intensive care units, 11 of whom did not suffer from a chronic condition. The total number of A/H1N1 related deaths reported by the Danish national health authority (SSI) was 30, which is in line with the total number of fatal cases in Denmark reported to the ECDC. However, there are slight differences in distribution of deaths p er week between these two sources , which may be caused by a delay in reporting to the ECDC. 3.5.2 Surveillance On 30 April, the European Commission agreed on a common case definition for the European Union in order to detect cases of influenza caused by the new virus. This case definition is presented in Table 4. In Denmark , two surveillance schemes for influenza -like illness (ILI) were already established, both based on pr imary health care consultations. The sentinel surveillance system was established in 1994 as a voluntary reporting system of general practitioners (GPs). It provides weekly reports on the total number of consultations and age -specific numbers of ILI -consul tations. Although reporting in this system usually stops during the summer (week 20 -week 40), data were collected throughout the year in 2009 . GPs were encouraged to report the number of patients who have visited the GP and to take samples from patients fu lfilling the A/H1N1 disease definition (Andersen, 2009b) . 119 The other system was established in 2006 in collaboration with the Danish Medical on -call service (DMOS) and replace s the function of the general pract itioners after opening hours . The physicians in service routinely report consultations due to influenza -like illness. Furthermore, influenza A became a laboratory reportable disease in 2009. Moreover , two new surveillan ce systems were set up in 2009. One wa s a surveillance system for infl uenza - related hospitaliz ations. This system collected data on hospitalizations from the national registry of all hospital contacts (Landspatientregisteret). The other surveillance system was an active reporting of influenza patients from a ll Intensive Care Units (ICUs) b etween week 46, 2009, and week 11, 2010 (M\u00f8lbak et al., 2011) . On 15 July, the Danish notification regulation of suspected cases was revised. The individual notification of suspected cases has been lifted and replaced by mandatory laboratory notification. The voluntary sentinel surveillance in primary health car e which comprises submission of weekly reports and sa mples was in place throughout the year (Andersen, 2009c) . On 16 July, the WHO announced that countries wit h community -wide transmission are no longer required to forward regular reports of individual confirmed cases to the WHO, as the detection, laboratory -confirmation and investigation of all cases is extremely resource - intensive and not sustainable for these countries (World Health Organization, 2009k) . In view of increasing numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 infections, the Danish National Board of Health changed its surveillance strategy. From 11 November onwards, laboratory testing was only recommended on sus picion of serious influenza disease requiring hospitalization (Andersen, 2009e) . Further, an active reporting system of influenza patients from a ll Intensive Care Units (ICUs) was set up b etween week 46, 2009, and week 11, 2010 (M\u00f8lbak et al. ., 2011) . 120 Figure 9: Epidemiology, key events and media attention during the A/H1N1 pandemic in Denmark Sources : Number of new A/H1N1 cases per week: Based on figure 3 in: Harder et al.

Number of A/H1N1 associated media stories: LexisNexis (Politik en&Politi ken weekly ) 121 3.5.3 Pandemic management strategy Initially, Denmark employed a containment strategy. Measures focused on limiting transmission of the virus or delaying the spread in order to gain time to apply effective response measures. This strategy included the following public health measures: those who met the clinical and epidemiological case definition were assessed through swabbing and laboratory testing; cases were treated with antivirals within 48 hours after onset of symptoms and requested to isolate at home or in hospital (depending on their clinical condition) until they were symptom -free; close contacts were traced and offered antiviral prophylaxis (Andersen, 2009a) . Furthermore the Danish National Board of Health recommended avoiding unnecessary travel to Mexico. But on 18 May this advice was lifted, partly by the fact that t he virus no longer primarily occurred in Mexico (Natio nal Board of Health, 2009f) . Acknowledging that the containment of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus was no longer possible, the Danish Board of Health has decided to change its strategy for dealing with influenza A (H1N1) from 7 July 2009. The new strategy fo cused on the treatment of those who are at risk and preventive treatment for people at risk . From 7 July onwards only risk group patients or patients with a close contact to a risk group patient needed to be swabbed, antiviral treatment was initiated in risk group persons only , prophylactic antiviral treatment was initiated in contacts to labora tory-confirmed cases provided the contact belonged to a risk group. People with one of the following conditions were defined as a risk group patient: chronic pulmona ry conditions, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, immunodeficiency, HIV - Infection, pregnant women (2nd and 3rd Trimester). Furthermore, it was recommended to closely monitor pregnant women in their 1st trimester, children < 5 years and severely obese patien ts (Andersen, 2009c; National Board of Health, 2009h) . 3.5.4 Vaccination strategy On 29 September, the European Commission authorized t he first two pandemic vaccines Focetria\u00ae (Novartis) and Pandemrix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline) for use in all Member States of 122 the European Union and in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009b) . On 6 October, the Europe an Commission authorized a third pandemic vaccine, Celvapan\u00ae, for use in all EU Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009c) . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended a two dose schedule for all three authorized vaccines (European Medicines Agency, 2009b) . On 23 Oc tober, the Danish National Board of Health published the priority groups for vaccination. According to this document vaccination had to be offered to the following persons: individuals aged six months and above in a clinical at -risk group, pregnant women and household contacts to severe immunosuppressed patients. The vaccine used in Denmark was Pandemrix\u00ae. Unlike the European Medicines Agency, the Danish National Board of Health recommended a two dose schedule for all individuals in at -risk groups and for children aged between 6 months and nine years. For otherwise healthy individuals a one dose schedule was recommended (National Board of Health, 2009n) . From the beginning of November 2009 Denmark started its vaccination program. Due to limited supply of Pandemrix\u00ae, the Danish National Board of Health has therefore decided to vaccinate those at risk under 65 years first. This decision was based on exper ience from other countries showing that older people have a lower risk of catching pandemic A/H1N1 (National Board of Health, 2009l; O' Flanagan et al., 2011) . In December , Denmark extended its vaccination program. From the beginning of December on, Denmark started to offer the vaccine also to people at risk who are over 65 years old (National Board of Health, 2009l) . On 2 December , the Danish National Board of Health adjusted its vaccination recommendations . From December on, only one dose of vaccine was recommended for patien ts at risk, unless they had a weakened immune system (Andersen, 2009f; National Board of Health, 2009p) . By the end of week 48, Denmark has 123 distributed nearly 500,000 vaccine doses, primarily to cover risk group vaccination (Andersen, 2009f) . On 12 February , the Danish government decided to extend the vacc ination program again. From mid -February on , the pandemic vaccine was also offered to people outside risk groups (National Board of Hea lth, 2010) . 3.5.5 Communication In order to give a better overview, the information published during the pandemic is grouped around the themes: Communication related to personal protective measures, communication related to A/H1N1 treatment , communication related to pandemic control measures, communication related to A/H1N1 vaccination and communication in the media . Communication related to p ersonal protective measures In April, the Danish National Board of Health published information leaflets on A/H1N1 f or travelers. The leaflet informed on pandemic A/H1N1 symptoms, personal protective measures, travel recommendations and about what to do in case of symptoms (National Board of Health, 2009a) . In addition to the public information and advice on national level, the ECDC provided information on European level. On 27 April, the ECDC published the first general questions and answers on pandemic A/H1N1 virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . In May, the ECDC published two documents on personal protective measures and informa tion for travelers. The documents described personal protective measures to reduce the risk of acquiring influenza, i.e. regular hand washing, respiratory hygiene, avoidance of close contacts and mass gatherings (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009k , 2009m, 2009n) . On 1st May, the Danish National Board of health set up an information hotline for citizens who have questions about Influenza A (H1N1) (National Board of Health, 2009e) . 124 On 30 November, the Danish National Board of Health published information leaflets and posters on pandemic A/H1N1 in English and six widely used minority languages ( Arabic, Urdu, Bosnian, Turkish, Somali, Persian) . These leaflets aimed to inform about symptom s, treatment and personal protective measures like regular hand -washing and respiratory hygiene (National Board of Health, 2009c, 2009d, 2009o) On 18 December , the Danish National Board of Health closed down i ts A/H1N1 information hotline. This decision was based on diminishing numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 infections. Citizens who had further questions on pandemic A/H1N1 were asked to look for information on the website of the National Board of Health or to conta ct their doctor (Natio nal Board of Health, 2009r) . Communication related to A/H1N1 treatment The use of antivirals in some groups involves particularities health professionals should know . Thus, on 8 May, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a guidance document on the use of the antiviral medicine Tamiflu in children under one year of age and the antivirals Tamiflu and Relenza in pregnant and breastfeeding women in the case of an influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. The EMA stated that in the event of a pandemic Tamiflu can be used to treat children under the age of one and both antivirals can be used to treat pregnant women, as the benefits of their use outweigh their risks (European Medicines Agency, 2009 a). On 18 August, the ECDC published general guidance on the use of antivirals during influenza pandemics. The document aimed to inform those deciding on antiviral use strategies about the effectiveness of antivirals, side effects of antivirals, priori ty groups for antiviral use and about necessary arrangements for antiviral delivery and administration (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009y) . On 1 October, the Danish National Board of Health published a guidance document for physicians and other health professiona ls. The document informed that efforts are still focused on the prevention and treatment of patients at risk. Furthermore, it informed health 125 professionals on general symptoms, risk groups, antiviral treatment of cases , prophylactic antiviral treatment of household contacts at risk and personal protective measures (National Board of Health, 2009j) . Communication related to pandemic control measures On 19 May, the ECDC published a guidance document on case and contact management. The recommended measures did not differ from the measures already applied in Denmark (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009o) . On 6 June, the ECDC published a guidance document on mitigation and containment strategies for national health authorities. ECDC stated that many public health measures are common in both strategies and the implementation of a mitigation strategy would mainly mean to move away from vigorous case finding and contact tracing. Further, the ECDC acknowledged that a containment strategy is very resource -intensive and therefore not a recommended infection control strategy for human influenza beyond pandemic alert phase 4 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009r) . On 26 June, the WHO published a guidance document on public health me asures to help countries manage the A/H1N1 pandemic. Besides giving general advice on response measures, the WHO provided additional advice for countries with widespread community - level transmission, for countries with no reported cases and for countries i n transition. The WHO advised all countries to concentrate on mitigation measures, to prepare the health -care system for a high volume of patients and to ensure antiviral medicine and vaccine supply. In addition, countries with widespread community -level t ransmission were advised to cease laboratory -testing of all cases, to reduce the pressure on the health -care system, to primarily focus on the treatment of ill patients, and to consider school closures or the cancellation of mass gathering on a case -by-case basis. Countries with no reported cases were advised that they may consider entry screening at airports and contact tracing, but that these measures are resource intensive and of limited benefit to prevent the spread of the disease. Countries in transiti on were advised to start the same control measures as countries with widespread community -level transmission (World Health Organization, 2009a) . 126 On 20 July, the ECDC gave scientific advice on reactive and proactive school closu res in Europe. ECDC highlighted that there is no consensus on the benefits from proactive school closures ( school closure before transmission be tween the children occurs), but countries and schools were advised to at least have plans for reactive school cl osures (school closure when many children and/or staff are experiencing illness) . These plans should consider the following issues: recommended length of time of closure; the triggers for re -opening; how to sustain teaching and learning; and potential prob lems that may arise for parents, if they have to take time off work (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009x) . In mid -September, the ECDC published a document on public health measures for policy and decision -makers (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . It provided scientific information on measures that may be applied to reduce the impact of influenza pandemics (i.e. border closures, entry restrictions, personal protective measures, social distancing measures, use of antivirals and vaccines) and aimed to help EU countries to decide on appropriate response measures (European Centre for Disease Pre vention and Control, 2009a) . On 23 September, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 5th meeting and agreed on continuing the following recommendations proposed by the WHO Director -General: borders should not be closed and travel and trade should not be restricted, countries should intensify surveillance of unusual events and people who are ill should postpone international travel (Worl d Health Organization, 2009n) . On 26 November, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 6th meeting and agreed that delaying international travel was no longer recommended for ill persons, because pandemic A/H1N1 infections were already widespread (Wor ld Health Organization, 2009p) . 127 Communication related to A/H1N1 vaccination Referring to media reports that have displayed concern about the safety of pandemic vaccine, the WHO has issued a note on pandemic vaccine safety on 6 August. In this statemen t the WHO outlined the procedures for approval and licensing of vaccines and confirmed that these procedures are strict and do include safety and quality controls. The WHO also stated that the data on influenza vaccine safety collected during the last 60 y ears do not show a special safety issue. Nonetheless, the WHO advised countries to closely monitor the safety and efficacy of the pandemic vaccine, as rare adverse events may only occur when large numbers of people got vaccinated (World Health Organiza tion, 2009l) . On 13 August, the ECDC published a document on the use of influenza pandemic vaccines during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The document aimed to inform those deciding on vaccination policies in the European countries on vaccine use and options for prioritization in order to maximize the benefit of available vaccine (European Centre for Disease Preventio n and Control, 2009z) . On 21 October, the Department of Epidemiology of the Danish National Board of Health published detailed information on Pandemrix\u00ae for health professionals. The document informed about who should not be vaccinated, what the pandemic vaccine contains, how long the vaccine does protect, what side effects the vaccine has, how long the vaccine was tested, the practical handling and storage of the vaccine (Andersen, 2009d) . On European lev el, information on vaccination was provided by the ECDC. In November , the ECDC published questions and answers on vaccines for health professionals and for the general public on its website (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009b, 2009c, 2010a) . On 19 November, the WHO issued a briefing note on pandemic vaccines in which the safety of the vaccines was reaffirmed (World Health Organization, 2009o) . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) did hold the same opinion. In a press release published on 20 November, the EMA reasserted the effic acy and safety of pandemic vaccines. Further, the 128 EMA revised its advice on vaccine schedules and published the following recommendations: Pandemrix\u00ae and Focetria\u00ae may be used as a single dose in adults (18 -60 years) and in children and adolescents (Focetr ia\u00ae: from the age of 9 years; Pandemrix\u00ae: from the age of 10 years). Individuals aged over 60 years may also receive one dose of Pandemrix\u00ae, but younger children and immunocompromised people should receive two doses (European Medicines Agency, 2009c) . Between December 2009 and August 2010, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published regular updates on safety monitoring of vaccines and medicines used during the pandemic (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . In its update on pandemic medicines of 18 December, the EMA reaffirmed that the available data on the three pandemic vaccines and Tamiflu \u00ae showed no unexpected serious safety issues (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . Communication in the media The search for articles mainly related to A/H1N1 in LexisNexis identified 302 articles published in Politik en and Politiken Weekly from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010. Of those, 229 have been classified as mainly related to A/H1N 1. Since the articles may have been published twice (or more than twice ) due to the particularities of the two newspapers, each article was considered only once in the following analysis. Overall , 176 different articles have been identified. The purple cur ve in Figure 9 shows the number of A/H1N1 associated media stories per week during the time of the pandemic. Compared to the A/H1N1 associated media stories published in the other countries included in this report , the curve shows a similar shape, but at a lower level. This is due to the inclusion of only two Danish newspaper s in contrast to three newspapers and the main TV news show in Germany, Spain and Czech Republi c. The curve in Figure 9 shows one major peak in week 18 and three minor peeks thereafter. In week 18, the WHO declared pandemic phase 4 and two days later, pandemic phase 5. In the same week, the first laboratory -confirmed A/H1N1 case was reported in Denmark. After week 18, the number of A/H1N1 associated media stories declined sharply and rema ined at a very low level until week 28. Then, the number of media stories increased steadily and reached a minor peak in week 32 (15 A/H1N1 associated media stories). This is roughly the 129 time when the peak of the first small A/H1N1 wave occurred in Denmark from week 29 to week 36. Ten A/H1N1 associated media stories were published in week 37, which was short ly after the first A/H1N1 death of a Danish citizen in Norway was reported. The media attention remained rather low until week 45, when the vaccinatio n program for people at risk under 65 years of age started. The number of media stories showed a minor peak in 46 and 48 (13 and 12 A/H1N1 associated media stories, respectively) . In week 46, the number of new A/H1N1 cases was also highest within the secon d A/H1N1 wave in Denmark. After week 48, the number of A/H1N1 associated media stories declined and remained at a rather low level until week 9 in 2010. 3.5.6 Risk perception and human behavior In late November 2009, the Gallup Organization conducted a survey called the Eurobarometer in the 27 EU Member States, as well as in Norway, Switzerland and Iceland to examine public opinion about influenza and pandemic A/H1N1. 58% (N=1008) of Danish interviewees believed it was unlikely or rather unlikely that they woul d personally catch the A/H1N1influenza . Furthermore, 60% stated that is was not likely or not likely at all that they would get vaccinated against the pandemic A/H1N1 virus. Health professionals were the most trusted source to inform about pandemic A/H1N1. 90% mentioned that they trust health professionals mostly or completely (The Gallup Organization, 2010) . The green curve in Figure 9 shows the number of A/H1N1 vaccines administered per week in Denmark. In week 45, when the vaccination program for people at risk started, 31,530 doses have been administered. In week 49 , the vaccinati on program for people at risk > 65 years started. The number of vaccines administered increased sharply until week 50 ( 318.820 doses administered) , but then remained at a rather steady level (number of vaccines admin- istered: personal communication Infectious Disease Epidemiology Department, States Se- rum Insti tut). 130 By the end of the pandemic, 339,515 vaccinated persons were recorded. Of these, 286,568 had a chronic condition, 5,780 were pregnant and 4,073 were contacts to severely immunosuppressed patients. 42,859 healthcare professionals and persons belonging to a key personnel group were vaccinated. After the remaining pandemic vaccines had been offered to healthy persons in mid -February (week 6 /2010) , 235 vaccinations have been reported. Overall, approximately 30% of all vaccinees received two doses (Andersen, 2010a) . In August 2010, the VENICE consortium conducted a web -based survey covering 27 European member states in addition to Norway and Iceland in order to estimate A/H1N1 vaccination coverage rates in different target groups and entire populations d uring the pandemic. For 22 countries, estimates on the vaccination coverage were provided . Table 9 shows the vaccination coverage according to the survey results for Denmark. 131 Table 9: A/H1N1 vaccination coverage in different target groups and the entire population in Denmark (Mereckiene et al, 2012) Vaccination coverage (%) Country Overall (n=22) a 6 months of age with chronic diseases and underlying conditions (n=9) Pregnant women (n=12) b Children (n=12) c Healthcare workers (n=13) d Denmark NA 20 NA NA NA a Some countries recommended pandemic vaccine for some population groups but calculated overall vaccination coverage. b Pregnant women: all countries that provided vaccination coverage recommended vaccination to all pregnant women (with or without risk indic ation). c Groups for which vaccination coverage were measured: France, Iceland, Italy, Norway and Slovenia (n=5), 6months -<18years of age; England, 6 months -<5 years age; Finland, 15 years of age; Ireland, >6months -<15years or age; Luxembourg, at ris k; Netherlands, 6 months -4years of age; Portugal, 6 months - 12 years of age. d Healthcare workers: Czech Republic, England, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal (n=5) recommended pandemic vaccine to only healthcare workers with close contact with patients; Estoni a recommended for healthcare work- ers with close contact with patient and with no contact with patients, but contact with potentially contaminated material; Hungary, Malta, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Slovakia (n=6) recommended pandemic vaccine to all health care workers. 132 4 Discussion This report presents the progress of the A/H1N1 pandemic in Germany, the UK, Spain , Czech Republic and Denmark. It explores the interaction of what actually happened (epidemic curves), how the countries responded (public health measures) , what protective measures the people were recommended (official recommendations) , how the media reacted (media attention) and how people perceived the risk and reacted (vaccination uptake) along the timeline of the pandemic . The first confirmed case of pandemic A/H1N1 in the five countries was reported in late April (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009f; Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009h; Surveillance Group for New Influenza A(H1N1) Virus Investigation and Control in Spain, 2009) . Initially, the five countries observed sporadic importations of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus from Mexico and the US. In the UK , sustained community transmission developed in June and the number of pa ndemic A/H1N1 cases increased sharply until the peak o f the first wave in late June . In Spain and Germany , the number of confirmed cases began to increase in July (Buda et al. , 2010; Health Protection Agency, 2010b; Sierra Moros et al. , 2010) . In Denmark and Czech Republic , the number of cases started to r ise in late July . Transmission subsided in all five countries as the summer progressed. In early autumn , transmission accelerated again and the numbers of reported pandemic A/H1N1 cases increased constantl y in, Germany, the UK, Spain , Czech Republic and Denmark . This autumn wave peaked between week 45/2009 and week 50 /2009 and thereafter , influenza activity decreased steadily. The pandemic influenza wave end ed in early to mid -January. Afterwards , only sporadic cases were reported (Buda et al. , 2010; Department of Health, 2010a; Larrauri C\u00e1mara et al. , 2010) Throughout the pandemic, the highest infection rates were observed in children and young people. Generally, the virus caused a mild illness. More severe disease was especially experienced by cases with underlying conditions (Department of Health, 2010a; Larrauri C\u00e1mara et al. , 2010; Schaberg & Burger, 2010) . 133 4.1 Control strategy The initial control strategy in Germany, the UK, Spain , Czech Republic and Denmark focused on limiting transmission of the virus or delaying the spread in order to gain time to apply effective response measures like large -scale vaccination . The measures applied during this c ontainment approach included the laboratory testing of all suspected cases, the tracing of contacts, the provision of antiviral s to cases and contacts and the isolation of cases . Further, information on the risk groups, severity and transmissibility of the virus was gathered through detailed analysis of the cases (Health Protection Agency, 2010b; Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a; 2010) . As the first few pandemic A/H1N1 cases were imported by travelers from Mexico and the US these measures may have helped to slow the initial spread of the virus , but a conclusive proof of this assumption is not possible (Hine, 2010; Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a) . The WHO had however already advised countries in late April to rather focus on mitigation measures as the containment of the outbreak was not considered to b e feasible (World Health Organization, 2009d) . In June, the ECDC too acknowledged that a containment strategy is very resource -intensive and therefore not a recommended infection control strategy for human influenza beyond pandemic alert phase 4 , which was announced on 27 Apri l 2009 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2 009r) . Although not recommended by both the ECDC and the WHO, Germany, the UK, Spain and Denmark continued to employ a strategy of containment (the UK and Denmark until early July, Spain until late July and Germany until early August) . Therefo re, the resource -intensive measures remained in place for longer than may have been beneficial (Hine, 2010; Krause et al. , 2010) . Probably, this was only possible because of the relat ively mild nature of the virus . In a more severe pandemic , public health professionals would probably have been overwhelmed earlier (Hine, 2010) . Although it became apparent at an early stage of the pandemic that the majority of people experienced a mild disease from the pandemic A/H1N1 virus , the lack of data on parameters needed for right risk assessment continued for a long time. E ven in mid -June, there were still unresolved issues relating to the severity of the disease, the specific risk groups and whether 134 or not the virus would remain sensitive to available antivirals (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009g, 2009s) . In the absence of clarity about the nature of the viru s, the li kely impact on different groups, and its potential to mutate , the continuation of the containment measures seems reasonable (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a) . Additionally, the virus continued to spread in an u neven manner across , Germany, the UK, Spain , Czech Republic and Denmark with some areas being more affected, while others remained almost unaffected. A move away from the containment approach may have seemed premature in largely unaffected areas. However , as done in the UK for \"hot spots\" areas, a more tailored, localized strategy might have been more efficient in managing local circumstance s in Germany, Spain , Czech Republic and Denmark (Hine, 2010; Krause Moros et al. , 2010) . The move away from the containment approach also affected the reporting and surveillance system . While the surveillance during the containment approach aimed to gather information on the clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the virus through laboratory testing and contact tracing , the surveillance during the mitigation phase rather focused on gathering information on the trend, intensity and impact of the virus. Germany, the UK, Spain and Denmark introduced surveillance systems to monitor severe cases and deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 (Buda et al. , 2010; S\u00e1nchez, ; M\u00f8lbak et al. ., 2011) . However, in Germany the usefulness of these data were limited as th e system was introduced too late and only a few sentinel hospitals joined the system (Krause et al. , 2010) . As the surveillance of severe cases is also relevant for other epidemic outbreaks, these surveillance systems should be improved or implemented as routine systems (Greco, Stern, & Marks, 2011; Krause et al. , 2010). During a pandemic , any changes in response measures should be communicated to the public in order to assuage public concern and maintain confidence in the decisions made by health authorities (Hine, 2010; Krause et al. , 2010) . The UK was the only country that produced 135 special leaflets for the public and health professionals to explain why the UK chose to move to a treatment only phase . Nevertheless , the majority of German, British, Spanish, Czech and Danish citizens were gene rally satisfied with the way authorities in their countries responded to the pandemic flu as shown in the EU survey conducted in November 2009 to explore public opinion on different aspects of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic across Europe. Among others, interview ees were asked how satisfied they were with preventive measures that authorities ha d taken against the pandemic A/H1N1 virus . In Germany (n=1 001) 5 3%, in the UK (n=1000) 60.8%, in Spain (n=1003) 62.7%, in Czech Republic (n=1002) 42.2% and in Denmark (n=100 8) 62.9% stated they were satisfie d with the measures taken by the authorities (The Gallup Organization, 2010) . 4.2 Vaccination strateg y Another intervention measure that Germany, the UK, Spain , Czech Republic and Denmark employed to counter the impact of the pandemic was large -scale vaccination especially of selected risk and priority groups . Spain decided to procure vaccine for 40% of t he population and the UK ordered vaccine for 100% of the population. Both countries decided to order enough vaccine to have two doses for e ach person (Hine, 2010; Germany`s initial plan was to procure enough pandemic vaccine for 100% of the population, thi s was later revised to 50 million doses (Feufel et al. , 2010; Marcic et al. , 2010) . The nature of the virus, its potential impact on different groups and the number of vaccine doses needed were still not clear when the initial decisions on vaccine procurement were made. Given the u ncertainties regarding the virus at the beginning of the outbreak, it was not easy to make a decision about the amount of vaccine to procure. Although, by the end of the pandemic less vaccine than purchased had been distributed (O'Flanagan et al. ., 2011) , the initial vaccine procurement decisions seem s reasonable considering the context in which it was made. The results in chapter 3 show that Germany, the UK, Spain , Czech Republic and Denmark responded to and changed vaccination policy and recommendations in response to available evidence on the characteristics of the virus 136 regarding the risk groups (Department of Health, 2009g; Ministerio de Sa Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009c, 2009f ), available on the immunogenicity (Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Medicamentos y Sanitarios, 2009v; Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009g) and in response to the pandemic progress (Department of Health. Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, 2010; Ministerio de Sanidad, Politica Social e Igualdad, 2010b) . The changes were based on advice from national expert gr oups . In order t o ensure vaccine supply, Germany and the UK had advance -purchase agreements with vaccine manufacturer s. As it became evident that less vaccine would be needed, the countries aimed to reduce the amount of vaccine. Vaccine manufacturers were willing to negotiate over ceasing the contract and suspending vaccine deliveries (Hine, 2010; Krause et al. , 2010) . However, i n future, negotiations with vaccine manufacture rs should attempt to include break clauses wherever possible, like it was done in the contract between the UK and Baxter Healthcare (Hine, 2010) . These break clauses allow for further flexibility in vaccine procurement. This i s important when new vaccines are more immunogenic than anticipated so that for most vaccines only a single dose is required, as it has been demonstrated now (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009g) . Due to prob lems in the manufacturing process of the pandemic vaccines initial supply was limited (Hine, 2010; Marcic et al. , 2010) . The prioritization of speci al groups allowed those at greatest risk the chance to be vaccinated first and made best use of limited supply (Department of Health, 2009g; Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009c) . Leaflets and communication on the government websites went alongside the vaccination programs . The general public was informed about the groups being vaccinated, the reasons behind this selection as well as potential side effect s and safety of the pandemic vaccine in all five study countries (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit et al. , 2009l ; Ministerstvo R, 2009 k; National Board of Health, 2009r) . In addition, the UK and Germany issued tailored information for at -risk groups and health professionals (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit et information for healthcare professionals was publishe d to inform them on the priority groups for vaccination, the specific pandemic vaccines and on aspects of vaccine administration (Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Medicamentos y R, 2009 2009i; Robert e & Paul -Ehrlich -Institut e, 2009) . In addition , to information on national level, the ECDC published questions and answers on vaccines for health professionals and for the general public on its website (European Cen tre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009b, 2009c, 2010a) . 4.3 Official communication In order to inform the general public on the pandemic A/H1N1 virus and personal protective measures, Germany, the UK, and Spain developed extensive information material s at an early stage of the pandemic (see the results section ' communication ' for each country). For Denmark and Czech Republic, however, the retrieved information is not sufficient for evaluating their communication strategy. The campaigns in Germany, th e UK and Spain provided a basic knowledge of hygiene and personal protective measures in order to prevent a pandemic A/H1N1 infection. In Germany, for the dissemination of information, various materials have been developed (flyers, posters , stickers) and campaigns were broadcasted on TV and radio. The tonality of the communication was calm and factual . The information was understandable , short and concise (Martin, 2010) . To meet the information needs of the population, information and advice was also accessible on government websites (Bundesministerium zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009 ; National Board 138 of Health, 2009 ). These websites contained all the necessary information in a clearly structured and concise manner . Disseminating basic information widely in the population was successful as becomes evident in the European survey that examined the public opinion about the pandemic. The majority of German (56.8%, n=1001), (48,4%, n=1002) citizens stated that they felt well informed about the pandemic A/H1N1 influenza (The Gallup Organization, 2010) . Other surveys found similar results (Hine, 2010; Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010b) . A clear p ublic understanding of the pandemic and how it may develop, is one prerequisite for an effective res ponse (Hine, 2010) , however some of the terminology used during the pandemic was misunderstood by the public. For example, the term pandemic was often assumed to refer to the severity of the disease (Feufel et al. , 2010; Hine, 2010; Krause et al. , 2010) . The communication did not clarify that the term pandemic also refer s to the extent of geographic spread of the virus, rather than to t he severity of the disease alone (Hine, 2010) . The moderate character of the pandemic should have been better communicated to the public as people might have been confused with what they expected and what was actually observable on the gr ound (Hine, 2010; Krause et al. , 2010) . In the absence of any other figures that described the possible development of the pandemic, the UK and the ECDC published planning assumptions of only the \"reasonable worst -case\". This term was often assumed to refer to likely events, which were eventuall y not observed in the countries (Hine, 2010) . The UK published the following key planning assumptions for the first major pandemic wave: 18.69 million cases, 370 ,000 people hospitalized, 2.8 million people with complications and up to 65. 000 deaths (Department of Health, 2009e) . The ECDC estimate for h ospitalization rate s in Europe was 1 -2% and the case fatality rate was estimated to be 0.1 -0.2% of all clinical cases (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009w) . What the UK and ECDC were saying and what was observable in the countries was not consistent. Generally, the virus caused a mild illness and mortality levels 139 were low (Buda et al. , 2010; Department Burger, 2010) . Although the UK and ECDC revised their planning assumptions downwards as more information on the characteristics of the virus became available, this gap could have risked weakening public trust in the response (Hine, 2010) . Instead of publ ishing planning assumptions which were easily misunderstood, existing and missing evidence should have been communicated in a more transparent way (Feufel et al. , 2010) . Thus, a more accurate picture of what are fac ts and what are extrapolations of the pandemic would have been provided to the public. In addition to the public information campaigns, tailored information for healthcare professionals on the treatment of cases and preventive measures had been published by national authorities. Regarding the vaccination program, appropriate information for healthcare professionals on the priority groups for vaccination, the specific pandemic vaccines and on aspects of vaccine administration ha d been published (Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios, 2009d; Department zdravotnictv\u00ed R, e & Paul -Ehrlich -Institut e, 2009) . As already observed in the previous chapter, healthcare professionals as the primary contact , have an important role in informing the public and promoting the adoption of preventive measures . But the exchange of information between health authorities and healthcare professionals could have been improved (Hine, 2010; Krause et Moros et al. , 2010) . According to a review of the response in the UK, some healthcare professionals stated that they did not receive timely information on the response measures from the authorities. Others stated that too much information and guidance was published (Hine, 2010) . The issue that healthcare professionals did not receive timely information was also observed in Germany. Here, especially information materials on the vaccination program appeared too late (Krause et al. , 2010; Schaade et al. , 2010) . Thus, to ensure timely and coordinated information for healthcare professionals a source of direct clinical advice, e.g. a hotline or secure internet site, would be helpful in a future outbreak (Hine, 2010) . 140 4.4 Risk perception and human be havior Although the public felt well informed about the pandemic A/H1N1 virus and about what they can do to protect themselves against it, the uptake of recommended behavior during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was low. According to the European survey 75% of the interviewees in Germany (n=1001), 86.2% of the interviewees in Spain (n=1003), 73.9% of the interviewees in the UK (n=1000), 76 .4% of the interviewees in Denmark (n=1008) and 76.1% of the interviewees in Czech Republic (n=1002) did not change their beh avior to protect themselves against pandemic flu. Among those who changed their behavior, t he most commonly adopted preventive measu res were regular hand washing and good respiratory hygiene. Further, the majority of interviewees felt that seasonal flu and pandemic flu are equally dangerous and stated that it was rather unlikely that they will catch the pandemic flu (The Gallup Organization, 2010) . According to several surveys, f actors independently associated with the adoption of the preventive measures are high perceived susceptibility to infection, high perceived effectiveness of the measures and high perceived usefulness of the information provided by the government (Ag\u00fcero, Adell, Gim\u00e9nez, Medina, & Continente, 2011; 2009; Rubin et al. ., 2010) . Thus, in any future campaign, more realistic information about the possibility of contracting the virus (based on observation) and revising this information as soon as more direct evidence becomes available , emphasizing the efficacy of recommended behaviors, reducing uncertainty and pr oviding clear information on the practical things that people can do to reduce their risk should help to maximize compliance with recommended measures. Additionally, in times of rapid dissemination of opinion through the internet , this information channel should be better used to detect false information and disseminate reliable information (Krause et al., 2010) . Further, factors like gender, educational level , ethnicity, age, household size, health status, and socioeconomic status do also affect behavioral responses during major outbreaks (Ag\u00fcero et al. , 2011; Rubin et al. , 2010) . These factors should also be taken into account in 141 any future campaign. As the interaction of these factors is likely to be complex, the consultation of behavioral scientists would be of value. Another importa nt aspect of human behavior during a pandemic is the uptake of the available vaccine. Although a lot of information on the pandemic vaccine ha d been distributed, vaccination coverage rates were low. In Germany, overall vaccination coverage was 4,6% in week 47/2009, 6% in week 49 but had only increased up to 8% overall and 16% in healthcare workers by the end of the second wave (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010b) . In Spain, the overall vaccination coverage rate was 27%. For those aged 6 month s and above with chronic disease and underlying conditions the vaccination coverage rate was 24%, for pregnant women 9% and for healthcare workers 12% (Mereckiene et al. , 2012) . In England, the vaccination coverage rate for people under the age of 65 years with chronic disease and underlying conditions was 37.6%, including pregnant women. Further, 23.6% of children between the age of six months and five years, and 40.3% of heal thcare workers received the pandemic vaccine in England. Vaccine uptake in Wales was similar and uptake in Northern Ireland and Scotland was higher than in England. 86.5% of people under the age of 65 years with chronic disease and underlying conditions re ceived the pandemic vaccine in Northern Ireland, and up to 54.5% of this group received the vaccine in Scotland. Coverage rates among healthcare workers were 47.7% in Northern Ireland and 55.1% in Scotland (Health Protection Agency, 2010b) . In Denmark , 20% of chronically diseased under 65 years of age got vaccinat ed. Czech Republic had the lowest vaccination uptake with an overall coverage of 0.6% and 7% among healthcare workers (Mereckiene et al. , 2012) . However, the methods used for calculating vaccination coverage varied between countries limiting comparability of these data. The UK, Spain, Denmark and Czech Republic used administrative data and Germany used a survey as a reliable system to monitor vaccination rates is still missing in Germany (Health Protection Agency, 2010b; Krause et al. , 2010; Koch -Institut e, 2010b) . Comparisons are also difficult due to the different starting dates of the vaccination programs. On 21 October, the UK started its vaccination program (Department of Health, 2009k) . The German vaccination program 142 started five days later, on 26 October (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, 2009) , the Danish vaccination program began on 8 November (National Board of Health, 2009l), the Spanish vaccina tion program commenced onl y one week later, on 16 November (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009l) and the Czech vaccination program started on 23 November (O'Flanagan et al. ., 2011) . Further, a comparison is difficult due to the different vaccination strategies, i.e. the prioritization of speci fic groups (Department of Health, 2009g, 2009v; O'Flanagan et al. ., -Institut e, 2009c, 2009f) . Reasons for the low vaccination coverage rates were seen in the late arrival of the vaccines, the moderate character of the pandemic, vaccine safety concerns and skepticism regarding the need for vaccination among a la rge part of the healthcare workers (Greco et al. , 2011; Marcic et al. 2010; Stern et al. , 2010) . According to a survey conducted in Germany the perceived risk due to swine flu dropped after the beginning of the vaccination program from 18% (n=1000) of interviewees who perceived the risk as great or partially great in week 47/2009 to 10% in week 51/2009 (Walter et al. ., 2012) . According to a European survey on the public opinion about the pandemic, conducted in November 2009, most of the German (69%, n=1001), Spanish (49%, n=1002 ) citizens believed it was not likely at all or rather unlikely that they would personally contract a A/H1N1 infection. When asked about the int ention to get vaccinated 62% of German, 66% of Spanish, 60% of Danish and 47% of Czech citizens stated it was not likely at all or not likely that they would get vaccinated, whereas in the UK only 37% of the respondents stated that they would not get vacci nated. The most stated reasons behind their choice were not being in one of the priority groups and safety concerns of pandemic vaccines (The Gallup Organization, 2010) . Although the EMA and WHO reaffirmed the safety of the pandemic vaccines (European Medicines Agency, 2009c; World Health Organization, 2009o) , and national authorities stated that vaccines were safe in their information leaflets (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr 143 Gesundheit et al. , 2009e; Department of 2009n; National Board of 2009k) , this message was obviously not effectively communicated to the public. In a future pandemic, authorities may con sider giving safety data more prominence. A more clearly risk -focused approach to communication may have helped uptake rates. In order to make informed decisions regarding vaccination, the risks associated with pandemic A/H1N1 infection versus the risk of vaccination need to be more clearly explained. Further, the use of social networking may also help to identify public concerns on vaccination and to adjust information material accordingly (Hine, 2010). So far, Germany, the UK, Czech Republic and Denmark m ade limited use of social networking. The interviewees in the aforementioned European survey were asked about the most trusted source from which they received information on the pandemic flu. 79 .8% (n=1001) of German, 86 .2% (n=1003) of Spanish, 91% (n=10 00) o f British, 90% of Danish and 82. 8% of Czech interviewees said they mostly or completely trust health professionals as source of information. The participants were also asked about the source from which they received information on the pandemic vaccine . 33.3% (n=1001) of German, 24.5% (n=1003) 22% of Danish (n=1008) and 18.4% (n=1002) of Czech citizens said they were informed by physicians. Only 9.6% of German, 13.8% of Spanish, 19.2% of Danish and 7.6% of Czech ci tizens stated that they informed themselves on vaccination through official leaflets. This number was a lot higher in the UK. The majority (64.6%) of British citizens said that they received information from official leaflets (The Gallup Organization, 2010) . Another survey conducted by the Robert Koch -Institute found similar results for Germany (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010b) . These results show that healthcare professionals need particular attention as they are a key factor informing the public and winning the trust of the population (Greco et al. , 2011) . According to the survey conducted by the Robert Koch -Institute, the majority of physicians advised people against getting vaccinated (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010b) . This result shows h ow essential it is that healthcare professionals have the right information in order to make informed decisions and 144 to pass on the right information to patients. Thus, knowledge and understanding of the medical profession regarding the goals , benefits and risks of vaccination should be encouraged in the future (Krause et al. , 2010) . Therefore, in a future outbreak , professional bodies should be more involved in informing healthcare professionals and the public a nd in promoting vaccine uptake (Schaade et al. , 2010) . As seen in Figure 3, Figure 5 and Figure 9 for Germany, UK, and Denmark , the main vaccine uptake took place in a window of 4 - 6 weeks after start of vaccination . This period could be considered as the window of opp ortunity during whi ch the public is alert and receptive for information. Precise and well formulated information broadcasted through multiple media channels as well as pro -active correction of misinformation and rumors during this period is one approach to increase public co mpliance. In addition , the trust of the public in health care professionals particularly family physicians merits that this group of professionals is comprehensively informed ahead of time and that th eir concerns are taken serious. 4.5 Communication in the media In all countries included in this analysis, the media attention defined as the number of A/H1N1 associated media stories was highest in week 18, when the WHO declared pandemic phase 4 and 5 and showed only minor peaks thereafter. These smaller peak s in media attention were mostly seen around the time when the first confirmed A/H1N1 death was reporte d in the respective country. Another aspect , which seems to be related to media attention, is the introduction of the vaccines and the discussion about p riority groups. The combined analysis of the elements described and discussed above, primarily shows that media attention was not really related to the epidemiology of A/H1N1 in the respective country during the course of the pandemic - rather, the atten tion was highest, considerably before the pandemic started to spread in the respective study countries themselves. Rather when the number of cases in the study countries peaked, the number of A/H1N1 associated 145 media stories was rather low. The same is true for the number of confirmed A/H1N1 deaths, except for the first one, which seems to be related to a peak in the media attention. The discrepant time-lag between media attention and the disease's epidemiology poses a challenge for the countries : First ly, it is very unlikely, that sufficient information about the virus, its potential spread and the disease's severity is known as early as week 18 in 2009 . Therefore, only likely projections can be made, which may be based more on fear than on facts. Secondly, using the initial media attention peak in week 18 to inform the population about the virus, the potential spread in the country as well as recommended preventive and curative measures is rather difficult with missing facts . This first media attention peak can however be used to inform the public about where they can find accurate information at a later stage when more facts about the disease will become known. Since a t the time, when more reliable information about the virus w as available and the health authorities started to publish information about prevention and treatment of A/H1N1, the media attention was already rather low. The media such as TV and newspapers were an important source of information, e.g . on the A/H1N1 vaccine, as stated by the participants of the Eurobaromenter survey. When asked from whom or where they received information about the A/H1N1 vaccine, 70 % of the Danish (n=1008) and 63 % of the German participants (n=1001), 63 % of the par ticipants from the UK (n=1000), 62 % of the Spanish (n=1003) and 56 % of the Czech participants (n=1002) named a TV show as source of information. 60 % of the respondents from the UK , 59 % of the German respondents , 58 % of the Spanish (n=1003), 53 % of th e Danish (n=1008) and 26 % of the Czech participants (n=1002) said that they received information from a magazine or newspaper (The Gallup Organization 2010). However, the trust in the media was considerably lower than the trust in other sources of informa tion such as health professionals. In the Eurobarometer survey, the participants have been asked how much they trust different sources to inform them about A/H1N1. In this study, 57 % of the Czech participants (n=1002) completely or mostly trusted the medi a, 41 % of the Danish 146 participants (n=1008), 36 % of Spanish participants (n=1003), 34 % of the participants from the UK (n=1000) and only 31 % of the German participants (n=1001) (The Gallup Organization 2010). The participants were also asked whether the media paid too much, enough or not enough attention to the pandemic (H1N1) flu. 52 % of the Spanish respondents stated that the media paid too much attention to A/H1N, 46 % of the German and 46 % from the UK, 41 % of the Danish and 29 % of the Czech parti cipants shared the same opinion. In most countries, however, a significant proportion of the participants stated that the media paid enough attention to A/H1N1 (Spain: 36 %, Germany: 44 %, UK: 35 %, Denmark: 51 %, Czech Republic: 55 %). (The Gallup Organi zation 2010). Another important source of information may be the internet. In a German survey on risk perception and information -seeking behaviour, overall (n=4003), 27.6% of the participants used the internet as source of information on A/H1N1 (Walter et al, 2012). However, there were differences in the various age groups, and only 10.2% of persons 60 years or older used the internet to receive information (Walter et al, 2012). In this analysis, influenza -related web search queries from Google Flu Trend s were included for Germany and Spain. In contrast to the early peak in the number of the A/H1N1 associated media stories, the peak in the number of search queries for influenza -like disease from Google Flu Trends was significantly later in the course of t he pandemic. The trend in the number of influenza -like web queries reflected the actual epidemic curve quite well , and seems to be a better indicator for the progression of the A/H1N1 epidemic compared to the media attention curve . This may indicate that p ersons start to search for health related information on the internet rather at a time, when cases of the infection already had occurred in the country , in their personal environment or they have been infected themselves . This health -seeking behavior may offer an opportunity for national and international health authorities to provide up -to-date information as well as to publish recommendations for prevention and treatment directly to the ir population , while they have a high interest in receiving informat ion. 147 Further, the data derived from Google Flu Trends may offer new opportunities in terms of surveillance. As Ginsberg et al (2008) pointed out; there is a high correlation between the relative frequency of certain queries and the percentage of physician visits because of influenza -like symptoms in particular areas. On this basis, the frequency of influenza -like disease was accurately estimated in various US regions previously. Since there is a reporting lag of only one day and the search queries can be a nalyzed quickly, they may be a valuable source for an up -to-date disease activity trend (Ginsberg et al. 2008). This was also shown in this report since the epidemic curves f or Germany and Spain were well reflected in the curves from Google Flu T rends. Another data source for influenza surveillance and especially early stage detection of epidemics may be the micro -blogging service Twitter. Its community has approximately 255 million active users per months with 500 million tweeds per day (https://about.tw itter.com/company (assessed 21.07.2014)). Aramaki et al. (2011) conducted a study using positive influenza tweeds to assess their correlation to the gold standard for influenza detection (here: Infectious Disease Surveillance Center (IDSC), Japan). In this study, the highest performance was 0.890 correlation, which was even higher than the Google search queries used by Ginsberg et al. 2008. However, Twitter's tweeds are very sensitive to excess news periods, which describe a large amount of media attentio n before the epidemic peak (which was also observed in this study, see above). Nonetheless, Twitter provides a valuable source for surveillance outside the excess news periods and may be useful for early stage detection of influenza epidemics. Furthermore, it may be an important method for official risk communication before or during a pandemic - at least for younger persons using the in ternet as source of information and being involved in online services such as Google and Twitter, but also further social networks. 148 4.6 Conclusion Although, several improvements have been identified regarding the vaccination and information campaign s more wo rk is needed to see how recommendations can be effectively translated into higher vaccination coverage and behavior change. This should also take into account the influence of varying media messages ( mainstream media, internet, new social media) during the pandemic and more data on public perceptions and changing behavio ral patterns during the different time period s of the pandemic. 4.7 Limitations 4.7.1 Data on pandemic A/H1N1 cases and deaths The data on confirmed pandemic A/H1 N1 cases in the UK, Germany, Spain , Denmark and Czech Republic are not comparable between the countries as there is variability in the data sources, size and rep resentativeness of the surveillance system s (Buda et al. M\u00f8lbak et al. ., 2011 ). However, it is not the aim of the project and this report to compare absolute numbers of cases or the disease's burden between the countries, but rather to show as well as to reflect on similarities and differences concerning the trends of the A/H1N1 epide miology. In addition, the shape of the epidemic curves is influenced b y changes in the testing and control policies throughout the pandemic . The steep decline in confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases, as it was the c ase in the UK after week 27 /2009, can be partly explained by changing testing policies with a general move away from inten se contact tracing and laboratory testing of all suspect ed cases (Health Protection Agency, 2009d) . This decline was also observed in Germany after th e notification regulation of suspect ed cases has been revised in week 46/2009 (Buda et al. , 2010) and in Denmark after mid-November when laboratory confirmation was only recommended in severe cases (Andersen, 2009e) . Also, cases with infection s so mild that they did not seek medical care were not reported. As such, the re was an under - 149 reporting of pandemic A/H1N1 cases and the epidemic curves do not represent the true figure of pandemic A/H1N1 cases. However, the intention of this work was to present the trend of the pandemic in the UK, Germany, Spain , Denmar k and Czech Republic and the epidemic curves do reflect this trend. This becomes evident in Figure 12, which presents the weekly number of confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases and weekly estimates of new pandemic A/ H1N1 cases in England . The figure shows that the actual number of cases was estimated to be up to a hundred times higher than the number of confirmed cases, but the pandemic profile is still visible in both cur ves. Just as reported cases are an underestimate, so are the data on deaths due to the 2009 pandemic influenza. A serious limitation of reporting the number of deaths was the attribution of cause of deaths to the pandemic A/H1N1 virus. A large proportion of deaths caused by pandemic influenza occurred in individuals who suffered from one or more chronic underlying medical condition (Department of Health, 2010a; Larrauri C\u00e1mara et al. , 2010; Schaberg & Burger, 2010) . Thus, m any deaths might have been recorded as due to the chronic underlying medical condition, and no t to the pand emic A/H1N1 virus (World Health Organization, 2009q) . 4.7.2 Systematic literature search In order t o obtain pandemic A/H1N1 surveillance data for Germa ny, the UK , Spain , Czech Republic and Denmark, a systematic literature search was accom plished using only Medline and Google Scholar. Therefore, there might have been more articles on pandemic A/H1N1 surveillan ce data in other databases (e.g. Embase ), which have not been considered . In addition, one exclusion criteria was to eliminate articles in languages other than English and German. Thus, potential articles on Spanish , Danish and Czech pandemic A/H1N1 surveillance data might have been neglected . Further, t he additional search fo r pandemic A/H1N1 surveillance data on websites of national health authorities and international health agencies might have missed information that has already been removed from the website s by the time the search was conducted . 150 4.7.3 Literature search on publi c health measures and official recommendations Although a lot of information on public health measures taken and official health behavior recommendations released during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was retrieved from grey literature and websites of the nation al health authorities and international health agencies , this search might have missed information that has already been removed from the website s or was not published. In addition, some information published in Spanish , Danish and Czech might have been ne glected due to the language barrier . 4.7.4 Data about communication in the media The data on the media attention throughout the pandemic are also not comparable between the countries, especially because of different data collection methods (Denmark, UK). However , it was not the aim of this study to compare the number of A/H1N1 associated media stories between the countries, but rather to assess similarities and differences in the trends of the media attention. 151 5 References Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de A.

However, there are slight differences in the number of deaths per week, which may be due to a lag in reporting to ECDC. 227 Containment strategy (National Board of Health, 2009h) May 2009 1 First laboratory confirmed A/H1N1 case in Denmark (National Board of Health, 2009b) Information hotline was set up (National Board of Health, 2009e) 18 Advice against travel to Mexico was lifted (Natio nal Board of Health, 2009f) Due to the novel influenza virus A(H1N1) outbreaks, the sentinel surveillance of influenza in Denmark was maintained beyond the normal influenza season (Andersen, 2009b) June 2009 11 Total number of cases: 11, all of which have been relatively mild. Infection in Denmark is still limited to persons who have been abroad and in some cases their immediate contacts (National Board of Health, 2009g) July 2009 6 Board of Health has decided to change its strategy for dealing with influenza A (H1N1) from 7 July 2009. Concentrating now on the treatment of those who are at risk and preventive treatment for people at risk (Andersen, 2009c; National Board of Health, 2009h) 15 Notification regulation of suspected cases revised. The individual notification of suspected cases has been lifted and replaced by mandatory laboratory notification. The voluntary sentinel surveillance in primary health care which comprises submission of w eekly reports and samples will be in place throughout the year (Andersen, 2009c) September 2009 3 First death of a Danish citizen in Norway (National Board of Health, 2009i) October 2009 1 Guidance for physicians and other health professionals on prevention measures and treatment of cases was p ublished (National Board of Health, 2009k ,2009j) 21 Department of Epidemiology published questions and answers on pandemic vaccine (Pandemrix) (Andersen, 2009d) 228 23 National Board of Health recommendations on priority groups for vaccination were published (National Board of Health, 2009m, 2009n) November 2009 8 Denmark begins vaccination: people at risk who are under 65 years of age (National Board of Health, 2009l; O'Flanagan, Cotter, & Mereckiene, 2011) Week 46 Active reporting of in fluenza patients from all Intensive Care Units (ICUs) between week 46, 2009, and week 11, 2010 (M\u00f8lbak et al.., 2011) . 11 Surveillance strategy revised (Andersen, 2009e) Week 48 Survey result: 58% (N=100 8) believed it was not likely at all or rather unlikely that they would personally catch the A/H1N1influenza; 60% stated it was not likely at all or not likely that they would get vaccinated against pandemic A(H1N1) 90% (N=1008 ) perceived Health professionals to be the most trusted source of information (The Gallup Organization, 2010) 30 Information leaflet and radio spots on influenza A/H1N1 in English and six widely used minority languages were p ublished (Arabic, Urdu, Bosnian, Turkish, Somali, Persian) (National Board of Health, 2009c, 2009d, 2009o) December 2009 Early Dec. From the beginning of December vaccination of people at risk who are over 65 years old started (National Board of Health, 2009l) 2 Board of Health adjusted vaccination recommendations. From now on, only one dose of vaccine for patients at risk, unless they have a weakened immune system (Andersen, 2009f; National Board of Health, 2009p) By the end of week 48, the SSI had distributed nearly 500,000 vaccine doses, primarily to cover risk group vaccination (Andersen, 2009f) 9 Number of reported deaths in Denmark : 16, including three outside risk groups (National Board of Health, 2009q) 18 A/H1N1 hotline was closed down (National Board of Health, 2009r) 229 January 2010 6 Total number of confirmed cases: nearly 5.000 Total number of deaths: 30 Hospitalizations: 1.000 (Andersen, 2010b) February 2010 12 The government has decided to offer the excess influenza A (H1N1) vaccines for the citizens who have not already been offered the vaccine (National Board of Health, 2010) June 2010 9 Total number of deaths: 32 - mainly among persons with underlying risk factors. Total numb er of vaccinated persons: 339,515, including 286,568 with chronic illness, 5,780 pregnant women and 4,073 contacts to severely immunosuppressed patients. A total of 42,859 persons from the groups of healthcare professionals and key personnel were vaccinate d (Andersen, 2010a) August 2010 Aug Vaccination coverage: Chronic disease (<65) 20% (Mereckiene et al. ., 2012) In-depth description of events and recommendations In order to give an in -depth description of the events, the pandemic has been split up into five time periods. Each time period is characterized by a different stage in the pandemic progress and different response activities of the UK, Germany, Spain, Denmark and the Czech Republic: Time period 1 (01/04/2009 to 21/06/2009). This time period is characteriz ed by the emergence of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus in Mexico and the spread of the virus to the UK, Spain, Germany, Denmark and the Czech Republic. It also describes early response strategies to contain the spread of the virus. Time period 2 (22/06/2009 to 0 2/08/2009). Numbers of confirmed cases increased constantly, therefore a change in prevention and control policy from containment to mitigation took place in this time period. 230 Time period 3 (03/08/2009 to 04/10/2009). Numbers of confirmed cases decreased during the summer. In this time period countries started to prepare the vaccination program. Time period 4 (05/10/2009 to week 30/11/2009). This time period is characterized by the autumn winter wave with a high number of confirmed cases. In this time perio d the UK, Germany, Spain, Denmark and the Czech Republic started their vaccination programs and campaigns. Time period 5 (01/12/2009 to 15/04/2010). This is the post peak period. During this time period the numbers of confirmed pandemic cases started to de cline constantly. To structure the information of each time period, the events were allocated to the following themes: situation, surveillance, control strategy and treatment of cases, vaccination strategy and communication. For a better overview each cou ntry is presented separately. 231 Germany Time period 1 Figure 16: Chronological overview of national and international events in the Germany for time period 1 (01/04/2009 to 21/06/2009) International National 232 Situation The pandemic started in Veracruz, Mexico where an outbreak of influenza -like illness was recorded in early April 2009 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . A few days later several parts of Mexico r eported further outbreaks of influenza -like illness. Analysis of samples detected an Influenza A virus but it was not possible to identify the subtype (World Health Organization, 2011) . In mid -April, t he US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analyzed a sample from two children with respiratory illness in southern California, USA and identified the virus as a swine influenza A/H1N1 virus (Centers for Disease Con trol and Prevention, 2009) . On 24 April WHO reported that virus isolates from Mexican patients were genetically identical to the new strain of swine influenza A/H1N1 virus discovered in California (World Health Organization, 2009b) . On the same day ECDC published its first Threat Assessment saying that although the public health situation was still limited to Mexico and the US further vigilance was required in Europe to ensure the identification of the new virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009d) . One day later, on 25 April 2009, the first WHO Emergency Committee meeting was held. International experts came together to assess the situation in Mexico and the US and to advice the WHO Director -General, Dr. Margaret Chan, on response measures. The Committee reported more information on the clinical presentation, epidemiology and virolo gy of cases was needed, but concluded that the situation was of international concern. Thus, Dr . Margret Chan declared the outbreak in Mexico and the US as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under International Health Regulations (2 005) and advised all countries to intensify surveillance for influenza -like illness and respiratory disease (World Health Organization, 2009c) . On the same day, the ECDC started to publish daily situation reports in which the current epidemiological situation was summarized. So far, 8 c ases of pandemic A/H1N1 have been confirmed in the United States of America. In Mexico City 854 cases of pneumonia have been reported, including 59 deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009e) . 233 Two days later, on 27 April, the first laboratory confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases have been reported in Europe, one in Spain and two in the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009f) . Based on avai lable data on confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases in Mexico, the USA, Canada, and reports on suspected cases in other countries, the WHO Director -General raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 4 (World Health Organization, 2009d) . While phase 3 is characterized by s poradic cases and limited human - to-human transmission of an influenza reassortant virus, phase 4 is defined by confirmed human -to-human transmission of an influenza reassortant virus capable to cause sustained outbreaks in a community (World Health Organization, 2012) . The WHO Director -General, Dr. Margaret Chan, did not recommend any trade or travel restrictions and advised to center on mitigation measures as the containment of the outbreak was not considered to be feasible (World Health Organization, 2009d) . Two days later, on 29 April, the influenza pand emic alert was raised to phase 5 (World Health Organization, 2009e) . This was a signal that a pandemic was coming up and human to human spread of the virus into at least two countries of one WHO region was evident, namely Mexico and USA (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009h; World Health Organization, 2012) . In its first risk assessment, published on 30 April, the ECDC reported missing information and data to define the seriousness of the potential pandemic. So far, the majority of pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disease and the case fatality rate was judged not to be different than for seasonal influenza (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009g) . As of 30 April, 3 confirmed cases have been reported Germany. Shortly after, seco ndary transmission of the virus was notified in Germany (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009i) . As of 12 May, Germany has reported 12 confirmed pandemic A/H1 N1 cases (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009l) . In its risk assessment update on 20 May, the ECDC again reported a continuing lack of data on parameters ne eded for right risk assessment. The ECDC considered available data and stated that the pandemic A/H1N1 infections have been generally mild in Europe. Now there 234 was more evidence that the virus was able to spread easily from one person to another and that i t preferentially infected younger age groups. ECDC concluded that the spread of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus will continue (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009p) . On 11 June, the WHO raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 6, declaring a pandemic (World Hea lth Organization, 2009h) . The severity of the pandemic was considered to be moderate by the WHO (World Health Organization, 2009i) . As of 15 June, Germany has reported 127 confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 to the ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009t) . Surveillance On 30 April, the European Commission agreed on a common case definition for the European Union in order to detect cases of influenza caused by the new virus. This case definition is presented in Table 15 (see chapter 0). To receive information on pandemic A/H1N1 infections at an early stage, a new notification regulation for physicians under \u00a7 6 IfSG came into force on 03.05.2009 saying that all suspected cases, confirmed cases and deaths from pandemic A/H1N1 virus have to be reported by name to the local health authorities (Bundesministerium der Justiz, 2009) . Control strategy and treatment of cases Initially, Germany employed a containmen t strategy. Measures focused on limiting transmission of the virus or delaying the spread in order to gain time to apply effective response measures. This strategy included the following public health measures: those who met the clinical and epidemiologica l case definition were assessed through swabbing and laboratory testing; cases were treated with antivirals within 48 hours after onset of symptoms and requested to isolate at home or in hospital (depending on their clinical condition) for at least seven d ays. Contacts were additionally asked to self -isolate at home for seven days with restrictions on visits (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a ). To avoid the introduction of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus through international air traffic, health authorities agreed th at instead of meeting all flights from Mexico, suspected cases had to be notified by the pilot of the plane and were examined at the airport of destination 235 by medical teams. Contact details of passengers were collected and information leaflets about pandem ic influenza were distributed (Marcic et al. , 2010) . The infection control measures at German airports were kept up until week 35/2009 (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a) . School closures were not recommended as a means of reducing the spread of the virus (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a) . Vaccination strategy As the new virus first emerged in April 2009, it was not possible to adjust the 2009/2010 seasonal influenza vaccine to this new influenza A/H1N1 strain (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009c) . The production of a pandemic -specific vaccine takes four to six months and can only be started when the new strain has been isola ted (Hine, 2010) . At the time Germany started to develop their vaccination strategy, the severity and infectivity of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus was still uncertain. Thus, it was difficult to decide on the quantity of required vaccine (Marcic et al. , 2010) . Germany had advance -purchase agreement contracts with vaccine manufacturers in order to secure sufficient vaccine supply in the event of a pandemic. These contracts were a result of Germany's pre -pandemic planning and were activated with the announcement of pandemic influenza alert phas e 6 (Marcic et al. , 2010) . The advance -purchase a greements in place included the assumption that enough vaccine for 100% of the population to have two doses would be needed (Marci c et al. , 2010) . Later, this assumption was revised downwards and only 50 million doses of pandemic vaccine were ordered (Feufel et al. , 2010) . Communication In order to give a better overview, the information published during time period 1 is grouped around the themes: personal protective measures, treatment of cases and control strategy. Personal protective measures: In Germany, the Robert Koch -Institut e (RKI) and the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) had already launched the information campaign \"Wir gegen Viren\" in March 2009, before pandemic A/H1N1 infections occurred in Germany. This campaign aimed to convey 236 basic knowledge on hygiene and personal protective measures to the public in order t o prevent viral infections. To disseminate the information, the RKI and BZgA developed posters, leaflets, sticker and a TV spot on hand washing (Robert Koch -Institut e & Bundeszentral e f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, 2009) . During the pandemic, these media were then refined and adjusted to the pandemic A/H1N1 influenza (Martin, 2010) . On 27 April, German health authority staff at airports started to distribute information leaflets in four different languages to travelers from affected countries. The leaflets informed on pandemic A/H1N1 symptoms and advised travelers to seek medical care in case of onset of symptoms. On the same day, the RKI set up an information hotline to prov ide a response to inquiries from citizens (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a) . In addition to the public information and advice on national level, the ECDC provided information on European level. On 27 April, the ECDC published the first general que stions and answers on pandemic A/H1N1 virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . In May, the ECDC published two documents on personal protective measures and information for travelers. The document s described personal protective measures to reduce the risk of acquiring influenza, i.e. regular hand washing, respiratory hygiene, avoidance of close contacts and mass gatherings (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009k, 2009m, 2009n) . Treatment of cases: The use of antivirals in some groups involves particularities health professionals should know . Thus, on 8 May, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a guidance document on the use of the antiviral medicine Tamiflu in children under one y ear of age and the antivirals Tamiflu and Relenza in pregnant and breastfeeding women in the case of an influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. The EMA stated that in the event of a pandemic Tamiflu can be used to treat children under the age of one and both antivirals can be used to treat pregnant women, as the benefits of their use outweigh their risks (European Medicines Agency, 2009a) . 237 Control strategy: On 19 May, the ECDC published a guidanc e document on case and contact management. The recommended measures did not differ from the measures already applied in Germany, Spain and the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009o) . On 6 June, the ECDC published a guidance document on mitigation and containment strategies for national health authorities. ECDC stated that many public health measures are common in both strategies and the implementation of a mitigation strategy would mainly mean to move away from vigorous case finding and contact tracing. Further, the ECDC acknowledged tha t a containment strategy is very resource -intensive and therefore not a recommended infection control strategy for human influenza beyond pandemic alert phase 4 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009r) . 238 Time period 2 Figure 17: Chronological overview of national and international events in the Germany for time period 2 (22/06/2009 to 02/08/2009) National International 239 Situation The numbers of confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 case s increased constantly. By the end of June, Germany has reported 429 confirmed cases. N umbers of confirmed cases continued to rise until early August . In its Threat Assessment, published on 1 July, the ECDC announced the first isolation of an oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu\u00ae) resistant mutant A/H1N1 virus in Denmark. The virus was not a reassortant virus and was still susceptible to zanamivir (also kn own as Relenza\u00ae). There was no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to other persons. ECDC stated that this phenomenon is well -known in influenza viruses and emphasized the need for continued surveillance of this problem (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009u) . According to an ECDC ris k assessment published on 20 July, 20 -30% of the population was expected to be affected over the first major wave of the pandemic. Clinical a ttack rates were expected to be highest in children and young adults. The estimate for h ospitalization rate s in Europe was 1 -2% and the case fatality rate was estimated to be 0.1 -0.2% of all clinical cases. ECDC stated that most cases experienced a mild and self -limiting illness, but people with chronic underlying medical conditions, pregnant women and young children w ere at higher risk of experiencing severe disease and deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009w) . Surveillance On 13 July, the surveillance strategy in Germany was modified. From week 29/2009 onwards regional health authorities were no longer required to submit reports on suspected cases to the state health authorities or to the Robert Koch -Institut e (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a) . On 16 July, the WHO anno unced that countries with community -wide transmission are no longer required to forward regular reports of individual confirmed cases to the WHO, as the 240 detection, laboratory -confirmation and investigation of all cases is extremely resource - intensive and n ot sustainable for these countries (World Health Organization, 2009k) . Control strategy and treatment of cases In early August 2009, Germany has changed its response strategy and moved to a mitigation strategy. The new strategy focused on risk groups and included the following changes: Contact -tracing was ceased, isolation was recommended for cases with contact to vulnerable persons only, antivirals were only given to cases in at -risk groups with signs of developing severe illness, case -based reporting requirements were relaxed and in late August infection control measures at airports were reduced (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2010a) . Vaccination strategy As initial supplies of pandemic vaccine were limited, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Exper ts (SAGE) on Immunization recommended that the following groups should be prioritized for vaccination: health -care workers; pregnant women; individuals aged above six months with a chronic medical condition; healthy individuals aged between 15 years and up to 49 years; healthy children; healthy individuals aged between 50 years and up to 64 years; and healthy individuals aged 65 years or above. The order of priority should be based on country -specific conditions (World Health Organization, 2009j) . Communication In orde r to give a better overview, the information published during time period 2 is grouped around the themes: control strategy, personal protective measures and non -pharmaceutical response measures. Control strategy: On 26 June, the WHO published a guidance do cument on public health measures to help countries manage the A/H1N1 pandemic. Besides giving general advice on response measures, the WHO provided additional advice for countries with widespread community - level transmission, for countries with no reported cases and for countries in transition. The WHO advised all countries to concentrate on mitigation measures, to prepare the health -care 241 system for a high volume of patients and to ensure antiviral medicine and vaccine supply. In addition, countries with wi despread community -level transmission were advised to cease laboratory -testing of all cases, to reduce the pressure on the health -care system, to primarily focus on the treatment of ill patients, and to consider school closures or the cancellation of mass gathering on a case -by-case basis. Countries with no reported cases were advised that they may consider entry screening at airports and contact tracing, but that these measures are resource intensive and of limited benefit to prevent the spread of the dise ase. Countries in transition were advised to start the same control measures as countries with widespread community -level transmission (World Health Organization, 2009a) . Personal protective measures: On 15 July, Germany starte d its A/H1N1 pandemic information campaign by publishing an information leaflet on personal protective measures in 11 languages (Die Beauftragte der Bundesregierung f\u00fcr Migration, Fl\u00fcchtlinge und Integration, 2009) . In addition, the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) provided information to the public on modes of transmission, symptoms of an A/H1N1 infection and on general hygiene measures to prevent the spread of the virus (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, 2009a) . Further, the Robert Koch -Institut e developed a document that aimed to inform the public about the influenza virus es and a pandemic in general , about modes of transmission of influenza viruses and about personal protective measures to prevent an influenza infection (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009i) . Non-pharmaceutical response measures: On 20 July, the ECDC gave scientific advice on reactive and proactive school closures in Europe. ECDC highlighted that there is no consensus o n the benefits from proactive school closures ( school closure before transmission be tween the children occurs), but countries and schools were advised to at least have plans for reactive school closures (school closure when many children and/or staff are e xperiencing illness) . These plans should consider the following issues: recommended length of time of closure; the triggers for re -opening; how to sustain teaching and learning; and potential problems that may arise for parents, if they have to take time o ff work (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009x) . 242 Time period 3 Figure 18: Chronological overview of national and international events in Germany for time period 3 (03/08/2009 to 04/10/2009) National International 243 Situation As of 4 August, Germany has reported 7177 confirmed cases to the ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009aa) . The virus continued to spread in the county, but at a low level over the summer. On 25 September, Germany reported the first fatal case from pandemic A/H1N1 infection (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009j) . On 21 August, the ECDC published its planning assumptions for the first major wave of infection, which was expected to take place in the autumn and winter of 2009/2010. However, these planning assumptions did not differ from those published on 20 July (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ab) . In late September, the ECDC has reduced its planning assumption. This d ecision was based on experience from Southern Hemisphere countries . It became more apparent that most pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disease; therefore hospitalization and case fatality rates were revised downwards (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ad) . Surveillance No surveillance strategy modifications were introduced. Control strategy and treatment of cases In week 35/2009 infection control measures at German airports were reduced (Robert Koch - Institut e, 2010a) . Vaccination Strategy On 29 September, the European Commission authorized the first two pandemic vaccines Focetria\u00ae (Novartis) and Pandemrix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline) for use in all Member States of the European U nion and in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009b) . 244 Communication During time period 3 a lot of information and guidance has been issued. In order to give a better overview, the publications are grouped around the themes: personal protective measures, non -pharmaceutical response measures, treatment of cases and vaccination. Personal protective measures: During the summer holiday season Germany observed importations of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus from affec ted countries, especially from Spain. Thus, in early August the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) in Germany issued a press release on personal protective measures on vacation to remind holiday -maker of performing the recommended hygiene measures even on holiday (i.e. avoidance of close contacts with sick people, frequently hand washing, good respiratory hygiene, self -isolation of sick the ECDC published a document on public health measures for policy and decision -makers (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . It provided scientific information on measures that may be applied to reduce the impact of influenza pandemics (i.e. border closures, entry restrictions, personal protective measures, social distancing measures, use of antivirals and vaccines) and aimed to help EU countries to decide on appropriate response measures (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009a) . On 23 September, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 5th meeting and agreed on continuing the following recommendations proposed by the WHO Director -General: borders should not be closed and travel and trade should not be restric ted, countries should intensify surveillance of unusual events and people who are ill should postpone international travel (World Health Organization, 2009n) . 245 Treatment of cases: On 18 August, the ECDC published general guidance on the use of antivira ls during influenza pandemics. The document aimed to inform those deciding on antiviral use strategies about the effectiveness of antivirals, side effects of antivirals, priority groups for antiviral use and about necessary arrangements for antiviral deliv ery and administration (European Ce ntre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009y) . Vaccination: Referring to media reports that have displayed concern about the safety of pandemic vaccine, the WHO has issued a note on pandemic vaccine safety on 6 August. In this statement the WHO outlined the procedures for approval and licensing of vaccines and conf irmed that these procedures are strict and do include safety and quality controls. The WHO also stated that the data on influenza vaccine safety collected during the last 60 years do not show a special safety issue. Nonetheless, the WHO advised countries t o closely monitor the safety and efficacy of the pandemic vaccine, as rare adverse events may only come to light when large numbers of people got vaccinated (World Health Organization, 2009l) . On 13 August, the ECDC published a document on the use o f influenza pandemic vaccines during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The document aimed to inform those deciding on vaccination policies in the European countries on vaccine use and options for prioritization in order to maximize the benefit of available vaccine (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009z) . On 4 September , the German Paul -Ehrlich -Instit ute issued information for physicians and pharmacists on the safety of pandemic vaccines during pregnancy. The Paul -Ehrlich - Institut e considered existing scientific evidence and concluded that the pandemic A/H1N1 vaccine s do not pose a risk to pregnant wom en. However, the Paul -Ehrlich -Institut e stated that this conclusion did not involve the recommendation of vaccinating all pregnant women at this point; and recommended to only vaccinate pregnant women if the potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh its p otential risks (Paul -Ehrlich -Institut e, 2009) . 246 Time period 4 Figure 19: Chronological overview of national and international events in Germany for time period 4 (05/10/2009 to 30/11/2009) National International 247 Situation In early autumn, the numbers of pandem ic A/H1 N1 infections in Germany have started to increase again, indicating the beginning of the expected autumn/winter wave. The second wave reached its peak in week 47/2009 (Buda et al. , 2010) . On 16 November, Germany has reported 16 deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ah) . As more information on the pandemic A/H1N1 virus became available showing that it remains relatively mild for most people and suggesting that the second peak may not be as high as actually thought , ECDC has revised its planning assumptions. In its 7th risk assessment issued on 6 November the following EU reasonable worst case planning assumptions for the first year up to mid -May 2010 were published: clinical attack rate: up to 20% of population, hospitalization rate: up to 100 per 100.000 population and case fatality rate: up to 3 per 100.000 population (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ag) . To monitor pand emic influenza A/H1N1 vaccine uptake during the vaccination campaign in Germany, thirt een telephone -surveys were performed between November 2009 and April 2010 . According to these surveys, the vaccination coverage in persons 14 years of age was 4,6% (N=1 000) in week 47 and 6% in week 49 (Walter et al. ., 2011) . The aforementioned 13 surveys were also monitor ing kno wledge, attitude and behavio r concerning pandemic influenza infection and vaccination against pandemic influen za. During the peak of the pandemic, only 18% (N=1000) of participants perceived risk due to swine flu as great or partially great; 34% stated the ir perception of risk was low (Walter et al.., 2011, 2012) In late November, the Gallup Organization conducted a survey called the Eurobarometer in the 27 EU Member States, as well as in Norway, Switzerland and Iceland to examine public opinion about influenza and pandemic A/H1N1. 69% (N=1001) believed it was unlikely or rather unlikely that they would personally catch the A/H1N1influenza . Furthermore, 62% 248 stated that is was not likely or not likely at all that they would get vaccinated against the pandemic A/H1N1 virus. Health professionals were the most trusted source to inform about pandemic A/H1N1. 80% mentioned that they trust health professionals mostly or completely (The Gallup Organization, 2010) . Surveillance In view of increas ing numbers of A/H1N1 infections , the German surveillance strategy was modified . From week 46/2009 onwards only laboratory confirmed cases and deaths relating to a pandemic A/H1N1 infection had to be reported to the RKI (Buda et al. , 2010) . To reduce the reporting effort for local health authorities, it was possible to only forward weekly aggregated case numbers to state health authorities and the RKI. In addition, laboratory testing was only recommended and reimbursed for cases with a high risk of developing severe disease, in order to ensure laboratory capa city and to reduce costs (Robert Koch - Institut e, 2010a) . In order to gather information on hospitalizations and deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 infections, the RKI set up the Pandemic Influenza A/H1N1 all hospitals were able to forward weekly aggregated numbers of hospital admission and deaths relating to a pandemic A/H1N1 infection to the RKI on a voluntary basis (Buda et al. , 2010) . Control strategy and treatment of cases During time period 4, no control strategy modifications have been implemented. Vaccination strategy On 6 October, the European Commission authorized a third pandemic vaccine, Celvapan\u00ae, for use in all EU Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009c) . On 12 October , the Robert Koch -Institut e published the priority groups for vaccination recommended by the German Committee on Vaccination (St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission; STIKO). According to the STIKO, three grou ps were identified that should be prioritized for vaccination in the following order: front -line health and social care workers; individuals 249 aged six months and above in a clinical at -risk group; and pregnant women. Clinical at -risk groups were considered to be the same as in the UK . The Robert Koch -Institut e and Paul - Ehrlich -Institut e recommended a one dose schedule for Pandemrix\u00ae for those aged 10 and up to 60 years. Individuals above 60 years of age should receive two doses and children aged below ten an d over six months two half adult doses of Pandemrix\u00ae (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009c) . While t he Robert Koch -Institut e and the Paul -Ehrlich -Institut e considered a one dose schedule for Pandemrix\u00ae to be sufficient for those aged 10 years and above, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended a two dose schedule for all three authorized vaccines (European Medicines Agency, 2009b) . The German vaccination program started on 26 October (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, 2009) . Communication Same as during time period 3 a lot of information and guidance has been issued during time period 4. In order to g ive a better overview the publications are again grouped around the themes: personal protective measures, non -pharmaceutical response measures, treatment of cases and vaccination. Personal protective measures: Before the start of the vaccination program th e Federal Ministry of Health in Germany has revised its offer of information. In order t o provide solid information for the general public and for health professionals , the Federal Ministry of Health, together with the Robert Koch - Institut e, the Federal Ce ntre for Health Education and the Paul -Ehrlich -Institut e, launched the central information website www.neuegrippe.bund.de (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, 2009) . This website provided information on the pandemic A/H1N1 virus, personal protective measures and the pandemic vaccine . In late October, the Federal Centre fo r Health Education developed a media package on hygiene practices for schools and kindergartens , called \"sch\u00fctz ich mich -sch\u00fctz ich dich\". Posters, stickers and leaflets aimed to inform children and adolescents on proper hand and respiratory hygiene . The materials were produced in two different designs to ensure age - 250 appropriate speech of children and adolescents (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, 2009c) . Non-pharmaceutica to increasing numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 cases, the Robert Koch -Institut e received many queries regarding the effectiveness of school closures as a means to contain the spread of the virus. Thus, on 16 November, the RKI published a brief overview on aspects of reactive and proactive school closures and stated that with respect to the current epidemiological situation proactive school closures were not recommended. Further, the RKI stated that decisions on reactive school closures sh ould depend on the epidemiological situation but an effect on the progress of the pandemic wave cannot be expected from reactive school closures (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009e) . On 26 November, the WHO Emergency Committee held it s 6th meeting and agreed that delaying international travel was no longer recommended for ill persons, because pandemic A/H1N1 infections were already widespread (World Health Organization, 2009p) . Treatment of cases: In late October, the RKI publish ed a guidance document for physicians. This document contained information on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus, the antiviral treatment, the vaccination, the notification regulations, and preventive and control measures (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009a) . Vaccination: Together with the start of the vaccination program, the public information campaign was launched in Germany. Information and advice was accessible on government websites and made available to the general public through leaflets (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit et al.., 2009e; Department Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009l) . In addition to the mainstr eam public information, the Federal Ministry of Health in Germany published tailored information for specific target groups (i.e. people with chronic underlying conditions; health professionals; pregnant women; and fire fighters clinical professi onal briefs on pandemic vaccination were published (Robert Koch -Institut e & Paul -Ehrlich -Institut e, 2009) . On European level, information on vaccination was provided by the ECDC. In November the ECDC published questions and answers on vaccines for health professionals and for the general public on its website (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 200 9b, 2009c, 2010a) . On 19 November, the WHO issued a briefing note on pandemic vaccines in which the safety of the vaccines was reaffirmed (World Health Organization, 2009o) . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) did hold the same opinion. In a press release published on 20 November, the EMA rea sserted the efficacy and safety of pandemic vaccines. Further, the EMA revised its advice on vaccine schedules and published the following recommendations: Pandemrix\u00ae and Focetria\u00ae may be used as a single dose in adults (18 -60 years) and in children and ad olescents (Focetria\u00ae: from the age of 9 years; Pandemrix\u00ae: from the age of 10 years). Individuals aged over 60 years may also receive one dose of Pandemrix\u00ae, but younger children and immunocompromised people should receive two doses (European Medicines Agency, 2009c) . 252 Time period 5 Figure 20: Chronological overview of national and international events in Germany for time period 5 (01/12/2009 to 15/04/2010) International National 253 Situation The number of pandemic A/H1N1 infections decreased constantly in Germany. On 11 December, Germany has reported 94 deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ak) . According to the survey monitoring vaccine uptake during the vaccination campaign in Germany , the vaccination coverage in persons 14 years of age was 8% (N=1000) in week 51/2009 (Walter et al. ., 2011) . Furthermore, only 10% (N=1000) of participants perceived risk due to swine flu as great or partially great (Walter et al. ., 2011, 2012) . The end of the autumn wave was in early January 2010. Afterwards only sporadic cases have been reported (Buda et al., 2010 ). However, the number of reported deaths increased from 176 in Mid -January to 235 in Mid -February (European Centre for Disease Pre vention and Control, 2010 c,d). In February 2010, evidence showed decreasing or low pandemic A/H1N1 activity in many countries, but the WHO Emergency Committee agreed that it was too early to conclude that the pandemic A/H1N1 virus has run its course. Th us, the pandemic influenza alert phase was not changed (World Health Organization, 2010a) . On 10 August 2010, the WHO Emergency Committee assessed the global situation again. This time the Committee concluded that the world was entering the post -pandemic period (World Health Organizati on, 2010c) . By the end of the pandemic, Germany has reported 225.729 cases and 250 deaths of pandemic A/H1N1 virus (Buda et al., 2010 ). Surveillance No surveillance strategy modifications were introduced. Control strategy and treatment of cases No control strategy modifications were introduced. 254 Vaccination strategy So far, in Germany the Committee on Vaccination (St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission; STIKO) recommended to offer pandemic vaccines to the following groups: front -line health and social care workers, individuals aged six months and above in a clinical at -risk group and pregnant women . Based on new data suggesting that young children and adolescents have an increased risk of contracting the pandemic A/H1N1 virus and of developing severe disease from the virus, the German Committee on Vaccination extended its recommendatio ns on priority groups for vaccination. This update was published on 14 December and included the following changes: After vaccination of the three identified priority groups , vaccine should also be offered to household contacts of people in at -risk groups, all children and adolescents aged between 6 months and 24 years, all adults aged between 25 and 59 years, and all individuals aged 60 years and over (Robert Koch -Institu te, 2009f) . In addition to the updated recommendations on priority groups for vaccination by the German Committee on Vaccination, the Robert Koch -Institut e (RKI) and Paul -Ehrlich - Institut e (PEI) updated their recommendations on vaccine dosage. So far, the RKI and PEI recommended a one dose schedule for Pandemrix\u00ae for those aged 10 and up to 60 years. Individuals above 60 years of age should receive two doses and children aged below ten and over six months two half adult doses of Pandemrix\u00ae (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009c) . Now, on the basis of available data on the pandemic vaccine Pandemrix\u00ae, the RKI and PEI recommended a one dose schedule for those aged 10 and above and one half adult dose schedule for children aged between 6 months and 9 years (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009g) . Communication During time period 5, only little information a nd guidance has been published. Thus, t he information and gu idance is only grouped around the theme: vaccination . Vaccination: Between December 2009 and August 2010, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published regular updates on safety monitoring of vaccines and medicines used during the pandemic (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . In its update on pand emic medicines of 18 255 December, the EMA reaffirmed that the available data on the three pandemic vaccines and Tamiflu \u00ae showed no unexpected serious safety issues (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . 256 UK Time period 1 Figure 21: Chronological overview of national and international events in the UK for time period 1 (01/04/2009 to 21/06/2009) International National 257 Situation The pandemic started in Veracruz, Mexico where an outbreak of influenza -like illness was recorded in early April 2009 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . A few days later several parts of Mexico reported further outbreaks of influenza -like illness. Analysis of samples detected an Influenza A virus but it was not possible to identify the subtype (World Health Organization, 2011) . In mid -April, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analyzed a sample from two children with respiratory illness in southern California, USA and identified the virus as a swine influenza A/H1N1 virus (Center s for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009) . On 24 April WHO reported that virus isolates from Mexican patients were genetically identical to the new strain of swine influenza A/H1N1 virus discovered in California (World Health Organization, 2009b) . On the same day ECDC published its first Threat Assessment saying that although the public health situation was still limited to Mexico and the US further vigilance was required in Europe to ensure the identification of the new virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009d) . One day later, on 25 April 2009, the first WHO Emergency Committee meeting was held. International experts came together to assess the situation in Mexico and the US and to advice the WHO Director -General, Dr. Margaret Chan, on response measures. The Committee reported more information on the clinical presentation, epidemiology and virology of cases was needed, but concluded that the situation was of international concern. Thus, Dr . Margret Chan declared the outbreak in Mexico and the US as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under International Health Regulations (2005) and advise d all countries to intensify surveillance for influenza -like illness and respiratory disease (World Health Organization, 2009c) . On the same day, the ECDC started to publish daily situation reports in which the current epidemiological situation was summarized. So far, 8 cases of pandemi c A/H1N1 have been confirmed in the United States of America. In Mexico City 854 cases of pneumonia have been reported, including 59 deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009e) . 258 Two days later, on 27 April, the first two laboratory confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases have been reported in the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009f) . Based on available data on confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cas es in Mexico, the USA, Canada, and reports on suspected cases in other countries, the WHO Director -General raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 4 (World Health Organization, 2009d) . While phase 3 is characterized by sporadic cases and limited human -to-human tr ansmission of an influenza reassortant virus, phase 4 is defined by confirmed human -to-human transmission of an influenza reassortant virus capable to cause sustained outbreaks in a community (World Health Organization, 2012) . The WHO Director -General, Dr . Margaret Chan, did not recomme nd any trade or travel restrictions and advised to center on mitigation measures as the containment of the outbreak was not considered to be feasible (World Health Organization, 2009d) . Two days later, on 29 April, the influenza pandemic alert was raised to phase 5 (World Health Organization, 2009 e). This was a signal that a pandemic was coming up and human to human spread of the virus into at least two countries of one WHO region was evident, namely Mexico and USA (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009h; World Health Organization, 2012) . In its first risk assessment, published on 30 April, the ECDC reported missing information and data to define the serio usness of the potential pandemic. So far, the majority of pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disease and the case fatality rate was judged not to be different than for seasonal influenza (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009g) . As of 30 April, 5 confirmed cases have been reported in the UK. Shortly after, secondary transmission of the virus was als o notified in the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009i) . As of 12 May, the UK has reported 65 confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009l) . At the start of the Sixty -second World Health Assembly on 18 May, members shared their experiences with the current outbrea k of pandemic influenza A/H1N1. Altogether, 40 countries have reported 8829 confirmed cases of pandemic A/H1N1. 97, 9% of the total number of cases was reported by six countries: the 259 USA (4714 cases), Mexico (3103 cases), Canada (496 cases), Japan (125 cas es), Spain (103 cases)8 and the UK (101) (World Health Organization, 2009f) . In its risk assessment update on 20 May, the ECDC again reported a continuing lack of data on parameters needed for right risk assessment. The ECDC considered available data and stated that the pandemic A/H1N1 infections have been generally mild in Europe. Now there was more evidence that the virus was able to spread easily from one person to another and that it preferentially infected younger age groups. ECDC concluded that the spread of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus will continue (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009p) . On 11 June, the WHO raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 6, declaring a pandemic (World Health Organization, 2009h) . The severity of the pandemic was con sidered to be moderate by the WHO (World Health Organization, 2009i) . As of 15 June, the UK has reported 1320 confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 to the ECDC. Additionally, the first fatal case in Europe was reported in Scotland (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009t) . To monitor public risk perception in relation to the pandemic A/H1N1 outbreak, 36 telephone surveys were conducted on weekly intervals across the UK between 1 May 2009 and 10 J anuary 2010. The results in Mid -May showed that only 16,6% (N=1173) of interviewees stated to be very or fairly worried about the possibility of catching pandemic A/H1N1. Along with the growing number of reported pandemic A/H1N1 cases, the percentage of wo rried persons increased as well. By Mid of June, 19,3% (N=1050) of interviewees stated to be very or fairly worried about the possibility of catching pandemic A/H1N1 (Rubin et al. ., 2010) . 8 Please note that the number of cases shown in Figure 6 differs from this number of cases. Figure 9 only shows data on confirmed cases from the SISS as the Spanish Ministry of Health and Social Policy (MHSP) stopped reporting total num bers of cases on 28 July 2009. Hereafter, the MHSP only reported incidence rates which were calculated from the SISS data (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009c) . 260 Surveillance On 30 April, the European Commission agreed on a common case definition for the European Union in order to detect cases of influenza caused by the new virus. This case definition is presented in Table 15. Table 15: EU case definition for pandemic A/H1N1 infection (European Commission, 2009a) Clinical criteria: Any person with one of the following three: fever > 38 \u00b0C AND signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection, pneumonia (severe respiratory illness), death from an unexplained acute respiratory illness. Laboratory criteria: At least one of the following tests: RT-PCR, viral culture (requiring BSL 3 facilities), four-fold rise in novel influenza virus A/H1N1 specific neutralising antibodies (implies the need for paired sera, from acute phase illness and then at convalescent stage 10 -14 days later minimum). Epidemiological criteria : At least one of the following three in the seven days before disease onset: a person who was a close contact to a confirmed case of novel influenza A/H1N1 virus infection while the case was ill, a person who has travelled to an area where sustained human -to-human transmission of nov el influenza A/H1N1 is documented, a person working in a laboratory where samples of the novel influenza A/H1N1 virus are tested. Case classification : A. Case under investigation: Any person meeting the clinical and epidemiological criteria. B. Probable case: Any person meeting the clinical AND epidemiological criteria AND with a laboratory result showing positive influenza A infection of an unsubtypable type. C. Confirmed case: Any person meeting the laboratory criteria for confirmation. 261 Contr ol strategy and treatment of cases Initially, the UK employed a containment strategy. Measures focused on limiting transmission of the virus or delaying the spread in order to gain time to apply effective response measures. This strategy included the following public health measures: those who met the clinical and epidemiological case definition were assessed through swabbing and laboratory testing; cases were treated with antivirals within 48 hours after onset of symptoms and requested to isolate at home or in hospital (depending on their c linical condition) for at least seven days; close contacts were traced and offered antiviral prophylaxis. Contacts were asked to self -isolate only if they developed symptoms (Health Protection Agency, 2010b ). To avoid the introduction of the pandemic A/H 1N1 virus through international air traffic, the UK started to meet all direct flights from Mexico at an early stage. Medical teams checked passengers and crew members on clinical symptoms and distributed information leaflets about pandemic influenza. In a ddition, contact details of passengers were collected to be able to inform them if it turned out that a person with confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 infection was aboard the same flight (Hine, 2010) . Health protection authorities in the UK advised schools to close for one week in the event of a confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 case at school and antiviral prophylaxis was given to all close contacts. The first school closure in the UK was on 29 April. On the same day, Gordon Brown announced that in order to provide antivirals for 80% of the population, the antiviral stockpile was to be increased from 33, 5 million to 50 million doses (Hine, 2010) . To implement the cont rol strategy at regional level in England, the HPA put in place Flu Response Centers staffed by HPA and NHS staff (Health Protection Agency, 2010c) . On 20 May, the HPA in the UK proposed to change the actions regarding the contact management at schools. Instead of offering antiviral prophylaxis to all contacts, only the closest conta cts should be given antivirals to reduce the risk of viral resistance due to non - compliance with the specified course of treatment (Department of Health. Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), 2009a) . However, the UK maintained its initial containment actions until 22 May, at which point the first adjustment was made. Based on 262 information on reduced prevalence of pandemic A/H1N1 in Mexico, the HPA stopped meeting all flight from Mexico (Health Protection Agency, 2009a) . As the numbers of cases increased steadily, the containment actions became more and more resource -intensive. Especially in the most affected areas in the UK, such as London and the West Midlands, the me asures became unsustainable. Therefore, on 10 June, the initial containment approach in the UK was relaxed for \"hot spot\" areas. As proposed by the HPA, antiviral prophylaxis was only offered to the closest contacts. Additionally, laboratory testing was no t necessary anymore if the clinical diagnosis indicated a high probability that the case was positive (Health Protection Agency, 2010c; Hine , 2010) . Vaccination strategy As the new virus first emerged in April 2009, it was not possible to adjust the 2009/2010 seasonal influenza vaccine to this new influenza A/H1N1 strain (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009c) . The production of a pandemic -specific vaccin e takes four to six months and can only be started when the new strain has been isolated (Hine, 2010) . At the time the UK started to develop their vaccination strategy, the severity and infectivity of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus was still u ncertain. Thus, it was difficult to decide on the quantity of required vaccine (Hine, 2010; Marcic et al. , 2010) . The ministers in the UK decided to procure 90 million doses of pre -pandemic vaccine, enough for 45% of the population to have two doses. Pre -pandemic vaccines contain the virus strain most l ikely to be similar to the pandemic strain. The ministers in the UK started to negotiate with the vaccine manufactures GlaxoSmithKline and Baxter Healthcare on the supply of the pre - pandemic vaccine. In the end, no pre -pandemic vaccines were purchased, as the negotiations were still ongoing when the influenza pandemic alert phase 6 was declared by the WHO, which triggered the advance -purchase agreements (Hine, 2010) . The UK had advance - purchase agreement contracts with vaccine manufacturers in order to secure sufficient vaccine supply in the event of a pandemic. These contracts were a result of the UK's pre - pandemic planning and were activated with the announcement of pandemic influenza alert phase 6. On 17 June, the ministers in the UK decided to purchase pandemic vaccine for 100% of the population (Hine, 2010) . 263 Communication In order to give a better overview, the informatio n published during time period 1 is grouped around the themes: personal protective measures, treatment of cases and control strategy. Personal protective measures: On 30 April, the information campaign started in the UK. The campaign ran on TV, on radio and in print media. Additionally, posters and leaflets were used and an information line was set up to provide up -to-date advice to the public. Further, advice and information was accessible on the government website. Same as in Spain and Germany, following good hygiene practices, i.e. using and disposing tissues and washing hands, was recommended as the best way to protect oneself from contracting the virus. To remember this, the UK campaign used the following slogan: \"Catch it, bin it, kill it\" (Department of Health, 2009a; Hine, 2010) . In addition to the public information and advice on national level, the ECDC provided information on European level. On 27 April, the ECDC published the first general questions and answers on pandemic A/H1N1 virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . In May, the ECDC published two documents on personal protective measures and information for travelers. The docu ments described personal protective measures to reduce the risk of acquiring influenza, i.e. regular hand washing, respiratory hygiene, avoidance of close contacts and mass gatherings (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009k, 2009m, 2009n) . Treat ment of cases: The use of antivirals in some groups involves particularities health professionals should know . Thus, on 8 May, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a guidance document on the use of the antiviral medicine Tamiflu in children under one year of age and the antivirals Tamiflu and Relenza in pregnant and breastfeeding women in the case of an influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. The EMA stated that in the event of a pandemic Tamiflu can be used to treat children under the age of one and both antiv irals can be used to treat pregnant women, as the benefits of their use outweigh their risks (European Medicines Agency, 2009a) . 264 Control strategy: On 19 May, the ECDC published a gui dance document on case and contact management. The recommended measures did not differ from the measures already applied in Germany, Spain and the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009o) . On 6 June, the ECDC published a guidance document on mitigation and containment strategies for natio nal health authorities. ECDC stated that many public health measures are common in both strategies and the implementation of a mitigation strategy would mainly mean to move away from vigorous case finding and contact tracing. Further, the ECDC acknowledged that a containment strategy is very resource -intensive and therefore not a recommended infection control strategy for human influenza beyond pandemic alert phase 4 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009r) . 265 Time period 2 Figure 22: Chronological overview of national and international events in the UK for time period 2 (22/06/2009 to 02/08/2009) National International 266 Situation The numbers of confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases increased constantl y. By the end of June the UK has reported 6929 confirmed cases (Health Protection Agency, 2009b ). On 1 July, the UK has reported 3 fatal cases (European Centre for Disease Preventio n and Control, 2009v) . The number of pandemic A/H1N1 cases has increased sharply until the peak of the first wave in week 27/2009. In its Threat Assessment, published on 1 July, the ECDC announced the first isolation of an oseltamivir (also known as Ta miflu\u00ae) resistant mutant A/H1N1 virus in Denmark. The virus was not a reassortant virus and was still susceptible to zanamivir (also known as Relenza\u00ae). There was no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to other persons. ECDC stated that this pheno menon is well -known in influenza viruses and emphasized the need for continued surveillance of this problem (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009u) . To monitor public risk perception in relation to the pandemic A/H1N1 outbreak, 36 telephone surveys were conducted on weekly intervals across th e UK between 1 May 2009 and 10 January 2010. In Mid -July, the percentage of worried persons had increased again compared to the percentage of Mid June (19,3%; N=1050). This time 32,9% (N=1050) of interviewees stated to be very or fairly worried about the p ossibility of catching pandemic A/H1N1 (Rubin et al. ., 2010) . On 16 July, the Department of Health in the UK made its first planning assumptions public. The figures represented a \"reaso nable worst case\", not a prediction on how the pandemic will evolve. The following key planning assumptions for the first major pandemic wave were published: 18.69 million cases, 370.000 people hospitalized, 2.8 million people with complications and up to 65.000 deaths. These figures referred to the total UK population of about 62.3 million (Department of Health, 2009e) . 267 According to an ECDC risk assessment published on 20 July, 20 -30% of the population was expected to be affected over the first major wave of the pandemic. Clinical a ttack rates were expected to be highest in children and young adults. The estimate for h ospitalization rate s in Europe was 1 -2% and the case fatality rate was estimated to be 0.1 -0.2% of all clinical cases. ECDC stated that most cases experienced a mild and s elf-limiting illness, but people with chronic underlying medical conditions, pregnant women and young children were at higher risk of experiencing severe disease and deaths (European Centre for Dise ase Prevention and Control, 2009w) . Surveillance On 2 July, the surveillance strategy in the UK was modified. This change implied that laboratory testing of all cases and case -tracing was ceased (Health Protection Agency, 2009d) . To monitor the safety of the medicines and vaccines that are on the market, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the UK has a an on -line reporting system in place, called the Yellow Card Scheme. This system is open to members of the public as well as healthcare professionals wanting to report suspected adverse drug reactions. On 6 July, a special web -based system for reporting suspected adverse drug reactions to Tamiflu, Relenza and to future pandemic vaccine was put into operation for the duration of the pandemic (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, 2009a) . On 16 July, the WHO announced that countries with community -wide transmission are no longer required to forward regular reports of individual confirmed cases to the WHO, as the detection, laboratory -confirmation and investigation of all cases is extremely resource - intensive and not sustainable for these countries (World Health Orga nization, 2009k) . Control strategy and treatment of cases Acknowledging that the containment of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus was no longer possible, the ministers in the UK changed the response strategy on 2 July. Due to the widespread of the virus within the UK, ministers decided to move from containment into the treatment phase. As already described in the previous chapter this change meant that laboratory testing was no longer required for all cases and case -tracing was ceased. Further, antiviral treatme nt 268 was only offered to clinical cases (Health Protection Agency, 2009d) . Additionally, to relieve some of the pressures on the health system, the National Pandemic Flu Service was launched in England on 23 July. This was an onli ne and telephone self -care service that allowed people to be assessed for pandemic flu and, if required, to get access to antivirals. If symptoms were causing concern or if cases were in an at -risk group, they were advised to contact their GP. Those who we re authorized to receive antivirals were able to pick up the drugs from one of the 2.000 antiviral collection points that were established across England. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland A/H1N1 cases accessed antivirals through the normal primary c are route, by taking a GP prescription to a pharmacy. In England, all clinical cases received antivirals, whereas GPs in the devolved administrations were advised to prescribe antivirals to cases in at -risk groups and any other cases based on clinical disc retion (Department of Health, 2009f; Hine, 2010) . Vaccination strategy The UK`s initial vaccination strategy was to provide pandemic vaccine for 100% of the population. T hus, on 26 June, contracts were signed with GlaxoSmithKline and Baxter Healthcare to make available 132 million doses of pandemic vaccine, enough for the whole population to have two doses of vaccine (Hine, 2010) . As initial supplies of pandemic vaccine were limited, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization recommended that the following groups should be prioritized for vaccination: health -care workers; pregnant women; individuals aged above six months with a chr onic medical condition; healthy individuals aged between 15 years and up to 49 years; healthy children; healthy individuals aged between 50 years and up to 64 years; and healthy individuals aged 65 years or above. The order of priority should be based on country -specific conditions (World Health Organization, 2009j) . Three days later, on 16 July, UK ministers agreed on the following priority groups for vaccination advised by DH\u00b4s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and previously endorsed by DH`s Sci entific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE): individuals aged between six months and 65 years in the current seasonal flu at -risk group ; pregnant women; children aged between 3 years and up to 16 years; and frontline health and 269 social care workers (Department of Health. Joint Commi ttee on Vaccination and Immunisation, 2009a; Department of Health. Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), 2009b; Hine, 2010) . At the beginning of the vaccine production, vaccine manufacturers had problems with low vaccine output. GlaxoSmithKl ine and Baxter Healthcare reacted to this problem by modifying their production process and thereby increased their vaccine output. Thus, on 29 July, the ministers in the UK decided to buy 30 million doses of additional pandemic vaccine from GlaxoSmithKlin e to ensure pandemic vaccine supply (Hine, 2010) . Communication In order to give a better overview, the information published during time period 2 is grouped around the themes: control strategy and non -pharmaceutical response measures. Control strategy: On 26 June, the WHO published a guidance document on public health measures to help countries manage the A/H1N1 pandemic. Besides giving general advice on response measures, the WHO provided additional advice for countries with widespread community - level transmission, for countries with no reported cases and for countries in transition. The WHO advised all countries to concentrate on mitigation measures, to prepare the health -care system for a high volume of patients and to ensure antivira l medicine and vaccine supply. In addition, countries with widespread community -level transmission were advised to cease laboratory -testing of all cases, to reduce the pressure on the health -care system, to primarily focus on the treatment of ill patients, and to consider school closures or the cancellation of mass gathering on a case -by-case basis. Countries with no reported cases were advised that they may consider entry screening at airports and contact tracing, but that these measures are resource inten sive and of limited benefit to prevent the spread of the disease. Countries in transition were advised to start the same control measures as countries with widespread community -level transmission (World Health Organization, 2009a) . On 2 July, the Department of Health in the UK published three documents on the new response strategy. The first document was intended for the NHS which outlined the rationale 270 of the movement from containment to treatment and set responsibilities for the NHS during the treatment phase (Department of Health, 2009b) . The second document provided clear information to the public explaining why the UK has chosen to move to a treatment phase, and the third document summarized scientific issues relevant to the new response strategy (Department of Health, 2009c, 2009d) . Non-pharmaceutical response measures: On 20 July, the ECDC gave scientific advice on reactive and proactive school closures in Europe. ECDC highlighted that there is no consensus on the ben efits from proactive school closures ( school closure before transmission be tween the children occurs), but countries and schools were advised to at least have plans for reactive school closures (school closure when many children and/or staff are experienci ng illness) . These plans should consider the following issues: recommended length of time of closure; the triggers for re -opening; how to sustain teaching and learning; and potential problems that may arise for parents, if they have to take time off work (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009x) . 271 Time period 3 Figure 23: Chronological overview of national and international events in the UK for time period 3 (03/08/2009 to 04/10/2009) National International 272 Situation As of 4 August, the UK the UK has reported 11912 cases to the ECDC. The UK has stopped laboratory testing of all suspected cases; therefore the reported numbers severely underestimate the true figure in the country. So far, the UK has recorded 30 deaths from pandemic A/H1N1 infection (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009aa) . The virus continued to spread in the country, but at a low level over t he summer. On 10 September, the number of reported deaths in the UK reached 76 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ac) . According to a survey observing people\u00b4s attitude towards the pandemic vaccine conducted between 14 August and 13 September 2009, 31,7% (N=5175) of respondents ranked the likelihood of getting vaccinated as very likely and 24,4% as fairly likely (Rubin et al. ., 2010) On 21 August, the ECDC published its planning assumptions for the first major wave of infection, which was expected to take place in the autumn and winter of 2009/2010. However, these planning assumptions did not d iffer from those published on 20 July (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ab) . In contrast to the ECDC, the Department of Health in the UK has modified its planning assumpt ions in early September. Based on the latest evidence on the severity of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus, the following values have been revised downwards: hospitalization r ate from 2% to 1% and upper case fatality rate from 0, 35% to 0, 1% (Department of Health, 2009i) . In late September, the ECDC has reduced its planning assumption as well. This decision was based on experience from Southern Hemisphere countries . It became more apparent that most pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disease; therefore hospitalization and case fatality rat es were revised downwards and were now in line with the figures published in the UK in early September (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ad) . Surveillance In October, the Health Protection Agency set up a w eb based reporting system for NHS Trusts across England to gather information on hospi talized pandemic A/H1N1 cases. With 273 this system the Health Protection Agency aimed to collect clinical, epidemiological and demographic data on all hospitalized cases with a confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 infection (Health Protection Agency, 2010b) . Control strategy and treatment of cases During time period 3, no control strategy modifications were introduced. Vaccination Strategy On 13 August, the priority groups for the pandemic A/H1N1 vaccination program were announced in the UK. Based on advice from the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) an d the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) four groups have been identified to be at highest risk of developing severe disease from a pandemic A/H1N1 infection. These groups should be prioritized for vaccination in the following order: people a ged between six months and up to 65 years in the present seasonal flu vaccine clinical at -risk groups, all pregnant women, household contacts of immunocompromised people, and individuals aged 65 in the present seasonal flu vaccine clinical at -risk groups . In addition, front -line health and social care workers should be vaccinated together with the first clinical at -risk group (Department of Health, 2009g) . Members of the clinical at -risk group were individuals with one of the follo wing underlying clinical condition: chronic respiratory disease; chronic heart disease; chronic renal disease; chronic liver disease; chronic neurological disease; immunosuppression; and diabetes mellitus (Department of Health, 2009h) . On 29 September, the European Commissi on authorized the first two pandemic vaccines Focetria\u00ae (Novartis) and Pandemrix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline) for use in all Member States of the European Union and in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009b) . 274 Communicat ion During time period 3 a lot of information and guidance has been issued. In order to give a better overview, the publications are grouped around the themes: non -pharmaceutical response measures, treatment of cases and vaccination. Non-pharmaceutical res ponse measures: In mid -September, the ECDC published a document on public health measures for policy and decision -makers (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . It provided scientific information on measures that may be applied to reduce the impact of influenza pandemics (i.e. border closures, entry restrictions, personal pro tective measures, social distancing measures, use of antivirals and vaccines) and aimed to help EU countries to decide on appropriate response measures (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009a) . On 23 September, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 5th meeting and agreed on continuing the following recommendations proposed by th e WHO Director -General: borders should not be closed and travel and trade should not be restricted, countries should intensify surveillance of unusual events and people who are ill should postpone international travel (World Health Organization, 2009n) . Treatment of cases: The use of antivirals in some groups involves particularities health professionals should know . Therefore, the following recommendations on the use of antivirals in children, pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding were publis hed the UK: zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae) or oseltamivir can be used in pregnant women , but zanamivir was recommended as first choice for treatment and prophylaxis, the preferred antiviral medicine for breastfeeding women is oseltamivir, children under the age of one year should only be treated with oseltamivir, post exposure prophylaxis for children under the age of one should only be offered after a thorough benefit -risk assessment (Department of Health, 2009j) 275 On 18 August, the ECDC published general guidance on th e use of antivirals during influenza pandemics. The document aimed to inform those deciding on antiviral use strategies about the effectiveness of antivirals, side effects of antivirals, priority groups for antiviral use and about necessary arrangements fo r antiviral delivery and administration (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009y) . Vaccination: Referring to media reports that have displayed concern about the safety of pandemic vaccine, the WHO has issued a note on pandemic vaccine safety on 6 August. In this stateme nt the WHO outlined the procedures for approval and licensing of vaccines and confirmed that these procedures are strict and do include safety and quality controls. The WHO also stated that the data on influenza vaccine safety collected during the last 60 years do not show a special safety issue. Nonetheless, the WHO advised countries to closely monitor the safety and efficacy of the pandemic vaccine, as rare adverse events may only come to light when large numbers of people got vaccinated (World Health Organization, 2009l) . On 13 August, the ECDC published a document on the use of influenza pandemic vaccines during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The document aimed to inform those deciding on vaccination policies in the European countries on vaccine use an d options for prioritization in order to maximize the benefit of available vaccine (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009z) . 276 Time period 4 Figure 24: Chronological overview of national and international events in the UK for time period 4 (05/10/2009 to 30/11/2009) National International 277 Situation In early autumn, the numbers of pandem ic A/H1N1 infections in the UK have started to increase again, indicating the beginning of the expected autumn/winter wave. In the UK the second wave peaked in week 45/2009 (Department of Health, 2010a) . On 15 October, the number of reported deaths in the UK reached 95 (European Centre for Disease Pre vention and Control, 2009ae) . On months later, this number had increased up to 185 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ah) . As more information on the pandemi c A/H1N1 virus became available showing that it remains relatively mild for most people and suggesting that the second peak may not be as high as actually thought , the worst -case planning assumptions for the UK were revised downwards once more. In the new planning assumptions, published on 22 October, the reasonable worst case for the clinical attack rate was reduced from 30% to 12% and the reasonable worst case for further deaths was reduced from 19.000 to 1.000 (Department of Health, 2009m) . In its 7th risk assess ment issued on 6 November, the ECDC has revised its planning assumptions as well. The following EU reasonable worst case planning assumptions for the first year up to mid -May 2010 were published: clinical attack rate: up to 20% of population, hospitalizati on rate: up to 100 per 100.000 population and case fatality rate: up to 3 per 100.000 population (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ag) . On 30 November, the UK`s Scientific Advisory Groups fo r Emergencies held a meeting in which modelers announced that the pandemic had now peaked and that the recently published worst case assumptions will not be reached (Department of Health. Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), 2009d) . In late November, the Gallup Organization conducted a survey called the Eurobarometer in the 27 EU Member States, as well as in Norway, Switzerland and Iceland to examine public opinion about influenza and pandemic A/H1N1. 49% (N=1000) believed it was unlikely or rather unlikely that they would pe rsonally catch the A/H1N1influenza . Furthermore, 37% stated that is was not likely or not likely at all that they would get vaccinated against the 278 pandemic A/H1N1 virus. Health professionals were the most trusted source to inform about pandemic A/H1N1. 91% mentioned that they trust health professionals mostly or completely (The Gallup Organization, 2010) . Surveillance During time period 4, no surveillance strategy modification was introduced. Control strategy and treatment of cases During time period 4, no control strategy modifications have been implem ented. Vaccination strategy On 6 October, the European Commission authorized a third pandemic vaccine, Celvapan\u00ae, for use in all EU Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009c) . As the European Commission has now authorized both vaccines procured by the UK (Pandemrix\u00ae and Celvapan\u00ae), the DH`s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization gave the following advice on vaccine dosage: one dose of Pandemrix\u00ae fo r those aged 10 years and above; two doses fo r immunocompromised individuals; two half adult doses for children aged below ten years and over six months; and two doses of Celvapan\u00ae for all age groups (Department of Health. Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, 2009c) . Four days later, on 12 October, this advice was endorsed by DH`s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) (Department of Health. Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), 2009c) . While the DH`s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization considered a one dose schedule for Pandemrix\u00ae to be sufficient for those aged 10 years and above, the E uropean Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended a two dose schedule for all three authorized vaccines (European Medicines Agency, 2009b) . On 21 October, the UK started its vaccination program (Department of Health, 2009k) . On 19 November, phase two of the UK`s vaccination program was announced by the Department of Health. Chief Medical Officer Liam Donaldson stated that the vaccination 279 program will be extended and vaccine will also be offered to all children ove r six months of age and under five years old. This decision was based on evidence showing that this age group is at higher risk of developing severe disease from an A/H1N1 infection than other healthy age groups (Department of Health, 2009u) . Communica tion Same as during time period 3 a lot of information and guidance has been issued during time period 4. In order to give a better overview the publications are again grouped around the themes: non -pharmaceutical response measures, treatment of cases and vaccination. Non-pharmaceutical response measures: On 26 November, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 6th meeting and agreed that delaying international travel was no longer recommended for ill persons, because pandemic A/H1N1 infections were already widespread (World Health Organization, 2009p) . Treatment of cases: The Department of Health in the UK published clinical management guidelines for adults and children and for pregnant women (Department of Health & Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 200 9; Department of Health, 2009q) . A third document aimed to provide guidance for health professionals on the use of antiviral prophylaxis during the A/H1N1 pandemic. It informed on situations when the use of antiviral prophylaxis in pregnant women and pe ople with underlying medical conditions was considered to be appropriate (Department of Health, 2009l) . In addition, information for health and social care workers who are pregnant or in other at -risk groups was published. This document gave advice on protecting healthcare employees who are pregnant, or in one of the other at risk groups (Department of Health, 2009o) . Vaccination: Together with th e start of the vaccination program, the public information campaign was launched in the UK. Information and advice was accessible on government websites and made available to the general public through leaflets (Department of Health, 2009n ). In addition to the mainstream public information, the Department of Health i n the UK produced tailored information for health professionals and pregnant women (Department of Health, 280 2009r, 2009s) . Furthermore, clinical professional briefs on pandemic vaccination were published (Department of Health, 2009p, 2009t ). On 5 November, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK published its first adverse reaction analysis on pandemic vaccines. In this report, the MHRA stated that there h ave been no new safety issues identified and that the benefits for Celvapan\u00ae and Pandemrix\u00ae still outweigh their risks (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory A gency, 2009b) . On European level, information on vaccination was provided by the ECDC. In November the ECDC published questions and answers on vaccines for health professionals and for the general public on its website (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009b, 2009c, 2010a) . On 19 November, the WHO issued a briefing note on pandemic vaccines in which the safety of the vaccines was reaffirmed (World Health Organization, 2009o) . The Europea n Medicines Agency (EMA) did hold the same opinion. In a press release published on 20 November, the EMA reasserted the efficacy and safety of pandemic vaccines. Further, the EMA revised its advice on vaccine schedules and published the following recommend ations: Pandemrix\u00ae and Focetria\u00ae may be used as a single dose in adults (18 -60 years) and in children and adolescents (Focetria\u00ae: from the age of 9 years; Pandemrix\u00ae: from the age of 10 years). Individuals aged over 60 years may also receive one dose of Pa ndemrix\u00ae, but younger children and immunocompromised people should receive two doses (European Medicines Agency, 2009c) . 281 Time period 5 Figure 25: Chronological overview of national and international events in the UK for time period 5 (01/12/2009 to 15/04/2010) International National 282 Situation The number of pandemic A/H1N1 infections decreased constantly in the UK. On 11 December, the UK has reported 283 deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009aj) . The end of the autumn wave was in early January 201 0. Afterwards only sporadic cases have been reported (Department of Health, 2010a ). In February 2010, evidence showed decreasing or low pandemic A/H1N1 activity in many countries, but the WHO Emergency Committee agreed that it was too early to conclude that the pandemic A/H1N1 virus has run its course. Thus, the pandemic influenza alert phase was not changed (World Health Organization, 2010a) . On 10 August 2010, the WHO Emergency Committee assessed the global situation again. This time the Committee concluded that the world was en tering the post -pandemic period (Worl d Health Organization, 2010c) . Altogether, the UK has reported 474 pandemic A/H1N1 influenza related deaths (Department of Health , 2010d ). Surveillance No surveillance strategy mod ifications were introduced. Control strategy and treatment of cases The National Pandemic Flu Service (NPFS) was launched in England in order to reduce the pressure on primary care. With decreasing numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 cases this service was not requ ired anymore and was closed down on 11 February. During its operation, the NPFS distributed antivirals to 1.1 million people. Two months later, on 1st April, antiviral collection points in England closed and the Swine Flu Information Line was stood down. Further, it was no longer possible to obtain antivirals from national stockpiles (Hine, 2010) . Vaccination strategy In December, the UK extended its vaccination program. As already announced in mid November, the UK started to offer pandem ic vaccine to children over 6 months and under 5 283 years of age. The recommendation on the vaccine dosage was updated and one half adult dose of Pandemrix\u00ae was now considered to be sufficient for children over six months (Department of Health, 2009v) . The DH`s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization in the UK did not recommend to extend the vaccination program to other groups of the population . This recommendation was based on the latest epidemiological evidence and modeling predictions, which showed that pandemic A/H1N1 activity has decreased and a third wave was unlikely (Department of Health. Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, 2010) . On 4 February, ministers approved this advice, but decided to set up a strategic reserve of 15 mi llion doses of pandemic vaccine (Hine, 2010) . The Department of Health has already contacted Baxter Healthcare in late December 2009 to stop supply of Celvapan\u00ae from 28 February 2010. This was possible, because a break clause was agreed w ith Baxter Healthcare at the time the UK ordered the vaccine in 2009 (Hine, 2010) . On 14 January 2010, ministers agreed to stop deliveries of Pandemrix\u00ae as well. As this contract did not include a break clause, the Department of Health co mmenced negotiations with GlaxoSmithKline over terminating vaccine deliveries. On 6 April, the Department of Health achieved agreement to only take deliveries of just under 35 million doses of Pandemrix \u00ae (The Secretary of State for Health, 2010) . Communication During time period 5, only little information a nd guidance has been published. Thus, t he information and gu idance is only grouped around the themes: vaccination and personal protective measures. Vaccination: In December 2009, the UK started to offer pandemic vaccine to children over 6 months and under 5 years of age . The Department of Health developed a leaflet for parents that contained tailored information about the second phase of the vaccination program (Department of Health, 2009w) . Between December 2009 and August 2010, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published regular updates on safety monitoring of vaccines and medicines used during the pandemic (European Medicines Agency, 2 010). In its update on pandemic medicines of 18 284 December, the EMA reaffirmed that the available data on the three pandemic vaccines and Tamiflu \u00ae showed no unexpected serious safety issues (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . Personal protec tive measures: In early January, the Department of Health in the UK published information leaflets in 32 languages to provide information on the pandemic A/H1N1 virus, personal protective measures, and the vaccination program for people who cannot speak or read English a nd who may not have access to a regular flow of news, i.e., an asylum seeker or refugee or a member of an established migrant group (Department of Health, 2010b) . 285 Spain Time period 1 Figure 26: Chronological overview of national and international events in Spain for time period 1 (01/04/2009 to 21/06/2009) International National 286 Situation The pandemic started in Veracruz, Mexico where an outbreak of influenza -like illness was recorded in early April 2009 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . A few days later several parts of Mexico r eported further outbreaks of influenza -like illness. Analysis of samples detected an Influenza A virus but it was not possible to identify the subtype (World Health Organization, 2011) . In mid -April, t he US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analyzed a sample from two children with respiratory illness in southern California, USA and identified the virus as a swine influenza A/H1N1 virus (Centers for Disease Con trol and Prevention, 2009) . On 24 April WHO reported that virus isolates from Mexican patients were genetically identical to the new strain of swine influenza A/H1N1 virus discovered in California (World Health Organization, 2009b) . On the same day ECDC published its first Threat Assessment saying that although the public health situation was still limited to Mexico and the US further vigilance was required in Europe to ensure the identification of the new virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009d) . One day later, on 25 April 2009, the first WHO Emergency Committee meeting was held. International experts came together to assess the situation in Mexico and the US and to advice the WHO Director -General, Dr. Margaret Chan, on response measures. The Committee reported more information on the clinical presentation, epidemiology and virolo gy of cases was needed, but concluded that the situation was of international concern. Thus, Dr . Margret Chan declared the outbreak in Mexico and the US as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under International Health Regulations (2 005) and advised all countries to intensify surveillance for influenza -like illness and respiratory disease (World Health Organization, 2009c) . On the same day, the ECDC started to publish daily situation reports in which the current epidemiological situation was summarized. So far, 8 c ases of pandemic A/H1N1 have been confirmed in the United States of America. In Mexico City 854 cases of pneumonia have been reported, including 59 deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009e) . 287 Two days later, on 27 April, the first laboratory confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 case has been reported in Europe and in Spain (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009f) . Based on available data on confirm ed pandemic A/H1N1 cases in Mexico, the USA, Canada, and reports on suspected cases in other countries, the WHO Director -General raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 4 (World Health Organization, 2009d) . While phase 3 is characterized by sporadic cases and lim ited human -to-human transmission of an influenza reassortant virus, phase 4 is defined by confirmed human -to-human transmission of an influenza reassortant virus capable to cause sustained outbreaks in a community (World Health Organization, 2012) . The WHO Director -General, Dr . Margaret Chan, did not recommend any trade or travel restrictions and advised to center on mitigation measures as the containment of the outbreak was not considered to be feasible (World Health Organization, 2009d) . Two days later, on 29 April, the influenza pandemic alert was raised to phase 5 (World Health Organization, 2009e) . This was a signal that a pandemic was coming up and human to human spread of the virus into at least two countries of one WHO region was evident, namely Mexico and USA (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009h; World Health Organization, 2012) . In its first risk assessment, published on 30 April, the ECDC reported missing information and data to define the seriousness of the potential pandemic. So far, the majority of pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disease and the case fatality rate was judged not to be different than for seasonal influenza (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009g) . As of 30 April, 10 confirmed cases have been reported in Spain (10 cases). Unlike all the other cases, one case in Spain had no history of travel to Mexico. This was the first evidence of human -to-human transmission within the EU (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009h) .. As of 12 May, Spain has reported 98 confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009l) . An analysis of the Spa nish cases showed that of the 98 confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases, 21 were confirmed secondary cases and one case 288 was a tertiary case (Surveillance Group for New Influenza A(H1N1) Virus Investigation and Control in Spain, 2009) . At the start of the Sixty -second World Health Assembly on 18 May, members shared their experiences with the current outbreak of pandemic influenza A/H1N1. Altogether, 40 countries have reported 8829 confirmed cases of pandemic A/H1N1. 97, 9% of the total number of cases was reported by six countries: the USA (4714 cases), Mexico (3103 cases), Canada (49 6 cases), Japan (125 cases), Spain (103 cases)9 and the UK (101) (World Health Organization, 2009f) . In its risk assessment update on 20 May, the ECDC again reported a continuing lack of data on parameters needed for rig ht risk assessment. The ECDC considered available data and stated that the pandemic A/H1N1 infections have been generally mild in Europe. Now there was more evidence that the virus was able to spread easily from one person to another and that it preferenti ally infected younger age groups. ECDC concluded that the spread of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus will continue (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009p) . On 11 June, the WHO raised the l evel of influenza pandemic alert to phase 6, declaring a pandemic (World Health Organization, 2009h) . The severity of the pandemic was considered to be moderate by the WHO (World Health Organization, 2009i) . As of 15 June, Spain has reported 488 confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 to the ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009t) . Surveillance On 30 April, the European Commission agreed on a common case definition for the European Union in ord er to detect cases of influenza caused by the new virus. This case definition is presented in Table 15. 9 Please note that the number of cases shown in Figure 6 differs from this number of cases. Figure 6 only shows data on confirmed cases from the SISS as the Spanish Ministry of Health and Social Policy (MHSP) stopped repor ting total numbers of cases on 28 July 2009. Hereafter, the MHSP only reported incidence rates which were calculated from th e SISS data (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009c) . 289 Based on the situation in Mexico and the US, the Coordinating Centre for Health Alerts and Emergencies (CCAES) at the Spanish Ministry of Health and Social Policy issued a national epidemiologic alert on 24 April. National and regional public health authorities were asked to enhance surveillance and to report urgent ly any case of influenza -like illness and severe respiratory disease among people who traveled to Mexico or who had contact with a confirmed case of pandemic A/H1N1 infection (Surveillance Group for New Influenza A(H1N1) Virus Investigation and Control in Spain, 2009) . Following the declaration of a public health emergency o f international concern (PHEIC) , the Ministry of Health and Social Policy launched the National Plan for Preparedness and Response to an influenza pandemic, including the activation of the Surveillance Subcom mittee, which held its first meeting on 27 April. This committee was responsible for defining and agreeing the strategy of surveil lance, although all decisions had to be presented to the Public Health Commission for approval (Sierra Moros et al. , 2010) . Spain`s i nitial case definition was amended and finally adopted on 7 May, 2009, to accommodate to the EU case definition. The modification included the following changes: the temperature defining fever was increased from 37,5\u00ba C to 38\u00ba C and the incubation period was reduced from 10 to 7 days (Santa -Olalla Peralta, Cortes Garc\u00eda, Mart\u00ednez S\u00e1nchez, et al., 2010) . To gather epidemiological data of pandemic A/H1N1 infections, a case -based surveillance was implemented which differed from the usual flu surveillance maintained by the Spanish Influenza Surveillance System (Sierra Moros et al. , 2010) . Control strategy and treatment of cases Initially, Spain employed a containment strategy. Measures focused on limiting transmission of the virus or delaying the spread in order to gain time to apply effective response measures. This strategy included the followin g public health measures: those who met the clinical and epidemiological case definition were assessed through swabbing and laboratory testing; cases were treated with antivirals within 48 hours after onset of symptoms and requested to isolate at home or i n hospital (depending on their clinical condition) for at least seven days. Contacts were additionally asked to self -isolate at home for ten days with restrictions on visits (Santa -Olalla Peralta, Cortes Garc\u00eda, Mart\u00ednez S\u00e1nchez, et al. , 2010) . 290 To avoid the introduction of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus through international air traffic, Spain started to meet all direct flights from Mexico at an early stage. Medical teams checked passengers and crew members on clinical symptoms and distributed informa tion leaflets about pandemic influenza. In addition, contact details of passengers were collected to be able to inform them if it turned out that a person with confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 infection was aboard the same flight. Spain maintained this measure un til 16 June. The infection control measures at German airports were kept up until week 35/2009 (D\u00e1vila Cornejo et al., 2010 ). School closures were not recommended as a means of r educing the spread of the virus (Ministerio de Sanidad, Servicios Sociales e Igualdad, 2 009). On May 20, the Surveillance Subcommittee in Spain changed the case and contact management strategy. It was agreed that a ntivirals will be given only to cases with severe disease, those with risk factors and contacts with risk factors. Whereas the i solation of cas es should be maintained, the isolation of contacts was not considered to be necessary anymore (Santa -Olalla Peralta, Cortes Garc\u00eda, Mart\u00ednez S\u00e1nchez, et al. , 2010) . Vaccination strategy As the new virus first emerged in April 2009, it was not possible to adjust the 2009/2010 seasonal influenza vaccine to this new influenza A/H1N1 strain (Robert Koch -Institut e, 2009c) . The production of a pandemic -specific vaccine takes four to six months and can only be started when the new strain has been isolated (Hine, 2010) . At the time Spain started to develop their vaccination strategy, the se verity and infectivity of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus was still uncertain. Thus, it was difficult to decide on the quantity of required vaccine (Hine, 2010; Marcic et al. , 2010) . On 13 May, the Public Health Commission in Spain adopted an estimate saying that vaccine for 40% of the population would be need ed. On the basis that two doses of vaccine per person were needed to achieve a sufficient immune response, the Public Health Commission planned to procure 36.6 million doses of pandemic vaccine (Ministerio de Sanidad, Politica Social e Igualdad, 2010b) . 291 Communication In order to give a better overview, the information published during time period 1 is grouped around the themes: personal pro tective measures, treatment of cases and control strategy. Personal protective measures: On 24 April, the Spanish Ministry of Health and Social Policy published information on personal protective measures for the public and for travelers on its website. Th e information aimed to raise early awareness of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus among the public and informed on personal protective measures, i.e. regular hand washing, respiratory hygiene and avoidance of close contacts with sick people (Surveillance Group for New Influenza A(H1N1) Virus Investigation and Control in Spain, 2009) . In addition to the public information and advice on national level, the ECDC provided information on European level. On 27 April, the ECDC published the first general questions and answers on pandemic A/H1N1 virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . In May, the ECDC published two documents on personal protective measures and information for travelers. The documents described personal protective measures to reduce the risk of acquiring influenza, i .e. regular hand washing, respiratory hygiene, avoidance of close contacts and mass gatherings (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009k, 2009m, 2009n) . Treatment of cases: The use of antivirals in some groups involves particularities health professionals should know . Thus, on 8 May, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a guidance document on the use of the antiviral medicine Tamiflu in children under one year of age and the antivirals Tamiflu and Relenza in pregnant and breastfeeding women in the case of an influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. The EMA stated that in the event of a pandemic Tamiflu can be used to treat children under the age of one and both antivirals can be used to treat pregnant women, as the benefits of their use outweigh the ir risks (European Medicines Agency, 2009a) . 292 Control strategy: On 19 May, the ECDC published a guidance document on case and contact management. The recommended measures did not dif fer from the measures already applied in Germany, Spain and the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009o) . On 6 June, the ECDC published a guidance document on mitigation and containment strategies for national health authorities. ECDC stated that many public health measures are common in both strategies and the implementation of a mitigation strategy would mainly mean to move away from vigorous case finding and contact tracing. Further, the ECDC acknowledged that a containment strategy is very resource -intensive and therefore not a recomme nded infection control strategy for human influenza beyond pandemic alert phase 4 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009r) . 293 Time period 2 Figure 27: Chronological overview of national and international events in Spain for time period 2 (22/06/2009 to 02/08/2009) National International 294 Situation The numbers of confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases increased constantly. By the end of June, Spain has reported 717 confirmed cases (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009b). On 1 July, Spain confirmed its first fatal case (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) , which raised the cumula tive number of deaths in the EU to four (UK three cases, Spain one case) (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009v) . The numbers of infections continued to increase until week 29/2009. In its Threat Assessment, published on 1 July, the ECDC announced the first isolation of an oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu\u00ae) resistant mutant A/H1N1 virus in Denmark. The virus was not a reassortant virus and was still susceptible to zanamivir (also kn own as Relenza\u00ae). There was no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to other persons. ECDC stated that this phenomenon is well -known in influenza viruses and emphasized the need for continued surveillance of this problem (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009u) . According to an ECDC ris k assessment published on 20 July, 20 -30% of the population was expected to be affected over the first major wave of the pandemic. Clinical a ttack rates were expected to be highest in children and young adults. The estimate for h ospitalization rate s in Europe was 1 -2% and the case fatality rate was estimated to be 0.1 -0.2% of all clinical cases. ECDC stated that most cases experienced a mild and self -limiting illness, but people with chronic underlying medical conditions, pregnant women and young children w ere at higher risk of experiencing severe disease and deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009w) . Surveillance On 26 June, Spain modified its surveillance strategy. The Pu blic Health Commission approved a strate gy based on 5 points, saying that: a case -based surveillance of severe cases should start, the influenza surveillance through the SISS should be maintained, monitoring of clusters of acute respiratory illness should be maintained, but a 295 case-based notification was not required anymore and only the first cases had to be swabbed for laboratory confirmation, monitoring of influenza or acute respirator y disease from the primary care comput erized database, as well as case-based monitoring of flu cases in the community should be maintained . In addition, the identification and monitoring of contacts and administration of prophylaxis to contacts was ceased . (Santa -Olalla Mart\u00ednez S\u00e1nchez, et al. , 2010) . On 16 July, the WHO announced that countries wi th community -wide transmission are no longer required to forward regular reports of individual confirmed cases to the WHO, as the detection, laboratory -confirmation and investigation of all cases is extremely resource - intensive and not sustainable for these countries (World Health Orga nization, 2009k) . On 27 July, the Spanish Surveillance Subcommittee agreed on a surveillance strategy update that suppressed the case -based surveillance of cases in the community. One day later, this new strategy was approved by the Spanish Public Heal th Commission (Ministerio de Sanidad, Politica Social e Igualdad, 2010a; Sierra Moros et al. , 2010) . Control strategy and treatment of cases On 27 July, Spain moved from containment to mitigation, although response measures have already been changed towards a mitigation strategy in late June, i.e. contact tracing was ceased. Case -based reporting of cas es in the community was stopped and antivirals were only given to cases requiring hospitalization and to those at risk of complications (Ministerio de Sanidad, Politica Social e Igualdad, 2010b; Sierra Moros et al. , 2010) . Vaccination strategy As initial supplies of pandemic vaccine were limited, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization recommended that the following groups should be prioritized for vaccination: health -care workers; pregnant women; individuals aged above six months with a chronic medical condition; healthy individuals aged between 15 years and up to 49 years; healthy chi ldren; healthy individuals aged between 50 years and up to 64 296 years; and healthy individuals aged 65 years or above. The order of priority should be based on country -specific conditions (World Health Organization, 2009j) . Communication In order to give a better overvi ew, the information published during time period 2 is grouped around the themes: control strategy and non -pharmaceutical response measures. Control strategy: On 26 June, the WHO published a guidance document on public health measures to help countries mana ge the A/H1N1 pandemic. Besides giving general advice on response measures, the WHO provided additional advice for countries with widespread community - level transmission, for countries with no reported cases and for countries in transition. The WHO advised all countries to concentrate on mitigation measures, to prepare the health -care system for a high volume of patients and to ensure antiviral medicine and vaccine supply. In addition, countries with widespread community -level transmission were advised to c ease laboratory -testing of all cases, to reduce the pressure on the health -care system, to primarily focus on the treatment of ill patients, and to consider school closures or the cancellation of mass gathering on a case -by-case basis. Countries with no re ported cases were advised that they may consider entry screening at airports and contact tracing, but that these measures are resource intensive and of limited benefit to prevent the spread of the disease. Countries in transition were advised to start the same control measures as countries with widespread community -level transmission (World Health Organization, 2009a) . Non-pharmaceutical response measures: On 20 July, the ECDC gave scientific advice on reactive and proactive sch ool closures in Europe. ECDC highlighted that there is no consensus on the benefits from proactive school closures ( school closure before transmission be tween the children occurs), but countries and schools were advised to at least have plans for reactive school closures (school closure when many children and/or staff are experiencing illness) . These plans should consider the following issues: recommended length of time of closure; the triggers for re -opening; how to sustain teaching and learning; and potential problems that may arise for parents, if they have to take time off work (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009x) . 297 Time period 3 Figure 28: Chronological overview of national and international events in Spain for time period 3 (03/08/2009 to 04/10/2009) National International 298 Situation As of 4 August, Spain has reported 1538 confirmed cases to the ECDC. Spain has stopped laboratory testing of all suspected cases; therefore the reported numbers severely underestimate the true figure in the two countries. So far, Spain has recorded 7 death s from pandemic A/H1N1 infection (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009aa) . The virus continued to spread in the country, but at a low level over the summe r. On 10 September, Spain reported 25 deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ac) . On 21 August, the ECDC published its planning assump tions for the first major wave of infection, which was expected to take place in the autumn and winter of 2009/2010. However, these planning assumptions did not differ from those published on 20 July (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ab) . In late September, the ECDC has reduced its planning assumption. This decision was based on experience from Southern Hemisphere countries . It became more apparent that most pandemic A/H1N 1 cases experienced a mild disease; therefore hospitalization and case fatality rates were revised downwards (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ad) . Surveillance On 9 September, the Sp anish Public Health Commission revised the surveillance strategy once again. According to the new strategy, the investigation of clusters of cases was only recommended in those cases deemed necessary to make a special intervention (Ministerio de Sanidad, Politica Social e Igualdad, 2010a) . Control strategy and treatment of cases No control strategy modification was introduced. 299 Vaccination Strategy In Spain, an agreement on priority groups for vaccination against pandemic A/H1N1 has been achieved on 31 August. The following population groups were considered to be priority groups for vaccination, but should not be prioritized in any order: health and social care workers, pregnant women, people working in essential public services (e.g. firefighters, policemen, workers at prisons, etc.), and individuals aged over six months in a clinical at -risk group. Clinical at -risk groups were considered to be the same as in the UK (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica 2010b) . On 29 September, the European Commission authorized the first two pandemic vaccines Focetria\u00ae (Novartis) and Pandemrix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline) for use in all Member States of the European Union and in Ic eland, Liechtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009b) . Communication During time period 3 a lot of information and guidance has been issued. In order to give a better overview, the publications are grouped around the themes: personal protective measures, non -pharmaceutical response measures, treatment of cases and vaccination. Personal protective measures: In mid -August, the pandemic A/H1N1 information campaign \"Gripe A. La prevenci\u00f3n es la major medida\" started in Spain (Ministeri o de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009a) . Therefore, the Ministry of Health and Social Policy has launched the information website \"informaciongripea.es\". This website provided information about the disease and advice on personal protective measures for t he general public. In addition, information and advice was made available to the public through posters, information leaflets, social networks and over the radio (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009a, 2012) . Besides the mainstream public information campaign, the Ministry of Health and Social Policy published tailored 300 information and guidance on preventive measures for families, schools and kindergartens (Ministerio de Sanidad -September, the ECDC published a document on public health measures for policy and decision -makers (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . It provided scientific information on measures that may be applied to reduce the impact of influenza pandemics (i.e. border closures, entry restrictions, person al protective measures, social distancing measures, use of antivirals and vaccines) and aimed to help EU countries to decide on appropriate response measures (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009a) . On 23 September, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 5th meeting and agreed on continuing the following recommendations proposed by the WHO Director -General: borders should not be closed and travel and trade should not be restricted, countries should intensify surveillance of unusual events and people who are ill should postpone international travel (World Health Organization, 2009n). Treatment of cases: The use of antivirals in some groups involves particularities health professionals should know . Therefore, the following recommendations on the use of antivirals in children, pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding were published in Spain: zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae) or oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) can be used in pregnant women , but zanamivir was recommended as first choice for treatment and prophylaxis, the preferred antiviral medicine for breastfeeding women is oseltamivir, children under the age of one year should only be treated with oseltamivir, post exposure prophylaxis for children under the age of one should only be offered after a thorough benefit -risk assessment (Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios, 200 9a) the guid ance on the use of antivirals, the Spanish Ministry of Health published recommendations on the treatment of cases with severe acute respiratory failure, recommendations on the clinical management of adults with pneumonia and recommendations on the treatmen t of pregnant women. The three documents aimed to inform health professionals on diagnostic tests, general and severe symptoms, antiviral treatment or the treatment of complications, and personal protective measures (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009d, 2009h, 2009i) . On 18 August, the ECDC published general guidance on the use of antivirals during influenza pandemics. The document aimed to inform those deciding on antiviral use strategies about the effectiveness of antivirals, side effects of antivirals, priority groups for antiviral use and about necessary arrangements for antiviral delivery and administration (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009y) . Vaccination: Referring to media reports that have displayed concern about the safety of pandemic vaccine, the WHO has issued a note on pandemic vaccine safety on 6 August. In this statement the WHO outlined the procedures for approval and licensing of vaccines and confirmed that these procedure s are strict and do include safety and quality controls. The WHO also stated that the data on influenza vaccine safety collected during the last 60 years do not show a special safety issue. Nonetheless, the WHO advised countries to closely monitor the safe ty and efficacy of the pandemic vaccine, as rare adverse events may only come to light when large numbers of people got vaccinated (World Health Organization, 2009l) . On 13 August, the ECDC published a document on the use of influenza pandemic vacci nes during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The document aimed to inform those deciding on vaccination policies in the European countries on vaccine use and options for prioritization in order to maximize the benefit of available vaccine (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009z) . 302 Time period 4 Figure 29: Chronological overview of national and international events in Spain for time period 4 (05/10/2009 to 30/11/2009) National International 303 Situation In early autumn, the numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 in fections in Spain have started to increase again, indicating the beginning of the expected autumn/winter wave . In Spain the autumn wave peaked in week 46/2009 reaching the weekly incidence rate of nearly 372 cases/ 100.000 population (Larrauri C\u00e1mara et al. , 2010) . In Mid -November, the number of reported deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 in Spain reache d 88 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ah) . In its 7th risk assessment issued on 6 November, the ECDC has revised its planning assumptions . The following EU r easonable worst case planning assumptions for the first year up to mid -May 2010 were published: clinical attack rate: up to 20% of population, hospitalization rate: up to 100 per 100.000 population and case fatality rate: up to 3 per 100.000 population (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ag) . In late November, the Gallup Organization conducted a survey called the Eurobarometer in the 27 EU Member States, as well as in Norway, Switzerland and I celand to examine public opinion about influenza and pandemic A/H1N1. 49% (N=1003) of Spanish interviewees believed it was unlikely or rather unlikely that they would personally catch the A/H1N1influenza . Furthermore, 66% stated that is was not likely or not likely at all that they would get vaccinated against the pandemic A/H1N1 virus. Health professionals were the most trusted source to inform about pandemic A/H1N1. 86% mentioned that they trust health professionals mostly or completely (The Gallup Org anization, 2010) . Surveillance During time period 4, no surveillance strategy modifications have been implemented. Control strategy and treatment of cases During time period 4, no control strategy modifications have been implemented. 304 Vaccination strateg y On 6 October, the European Commission authorized a third pandemic vaccine, Celvapan\u00ae, for use in all EU Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009c) . On 16 November the Spanish vaccination p rogram commenced (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009l) . Just in time for the start of the vaccination program the new pandemic vaccine Panenza\u00ae was authorized in Spain. It has been authorized by a decentralized procedure in which national agencies of Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg have participated . Panenza\u00ae is a vaccine without an adjuvant and was administered to pregnant women (Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios, 2009c) recommended to be administered to a dults aged between 18 and 60 years only. The first choice for the other age groups was Focetria\u00ae. The Spanish Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency (Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios ; one dose schedule for Pand emrix\u00ae and Focetria\u00ae for individuals aged over de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios, 2009d) . Communication Same as during time period 3 a lot of information and guidance has been issued during time period 4. In order to give a better overview the publications are again grouped around the themes: non -pharmaceutical response measures, treatment of cases and vaccination. Non-pharmaceutical response measures: On 26 November, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 6th meeting and agreed that delaying international travel was no longer recommended for ill persons, because pandemic A/H1N1 infections were already widespread (World Health Organization, 2009p) . Treatment of cases: In October, the Spanish Ministry of Health and Social Policy published two documents for health professionals. The first document aimed to inform health professionals on diagnostic procedures and the treatment of pandemic A/H1N1 infections. It contained 305 recommendations regarding the criteria for hospitalization, the organization of care, the treatment with antivirals and personal protective measures (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009j) . The second document included recommendations on prevention and control measures in retirement homes. It informed on general hygiene measures, the management of cases and on available pandemic vaccines (Ministerio de Sanidad y Politica Social, 2009k) . Vaccination: Together with the start of the vaccination program, the public information campaign was launched in Spain. Information and advice was accessible on government websites and made available to the general public through leaflets (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit et al. ., Sanidad Social, 2009l) . On 5 November, the Medicin es and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK published its first adverse reaction analysis on pandemic vaccines. In this report, the MHRA stated that there have been no new safety issues identified and that the benefits for Celvapan\u00ae and P andemrix\u00ae still outweigh their risks (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, 2009b) . On European level, information on vaccination was provided by t he ECDC. In November the ECDC published questions and answers on vaccines for health professionals and for the general public on its website (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009b, 2009c, 2010a) . On 19 November, the WHO issued a briefing n ote on pandemic vaccines in which the safety of the vaccines was reaffirmed (World Health Organization, 2009o) . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) did hold the same opinion. In a press release published on 20 November, the EMA reasserted the efficacy and safety of pandemic vaccines. Further, the EMA revised its advice on vaccine schedules and published the following recommendations: Pandemrix\u00ae and Focetria\u00ae may be used as a single dose in adults (18 -60 years) and in children and adolescents (Focetria\u00ae: from the age of 9 years; Pandemrix\u00ae: from th e age of 10 years). Individuals aged over 60 years may also receive one dose of Pandemrix\u00ae, but 306 younger children and immunocompromised people should receive two doses (European Medicines Agency, 2009c) . 307 Time period 5 Figure 30: Chronological overview of national and international events in Spain for time period 5 (01/12/2009 to 15/04/2010) International National 308 Situation The number of pandemic A/H1N1 infections decreased constantly in Spain. The end of the autumn wave was in early January 2010. Afterwards only sporadic cases have been reported (Larrauri C\u00e1mara et al. , 2010) . In Mid -January, the number of reported deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 in Spain reached 271 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010b) . In February 2010, evidence showed decreasing or low pandemic A/ H1N1 activity in many countries, but the WHO Emergency Committee agreed that it was too early to conclude that the pandemic A/H1N1 virus has run its course. Thus, the pandemic influenza alert phase was not changed (World Health Organization, 2010a) . On 10 August 2010, the WHO Emergency Committee assessed the global situation again. This time the Committee concluded that the world was entering the post -pandemic period (World Health Organization, 2010c) . Altogether, the total number of reported deaths due to pandemic A/H1N1 influenza a cross Spain was 348 (Ministerio de Sanidad, Politica Social e Igualda d, 2010a) . Surveillance On 4 December, the Spanish Surv eillance Subcommittee eased the reporting requirements for severe cases. Two month later, on 1st February, the case -based monitoring of severe cases was stopped in favor of weekly aggregated reports of severe pandemic A/H1N1 cases. On 1st April, this new reporting requirement was ceased as well. Additionally, the notification of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 related deaths was stopped (Ministerio de Sanidad, Politica Social e Igualdad, 2010a) . Control strategy and treatment of cases No control strategy modifications were introduced. Vaccination strategy No vaccination strategy modifications were introduced. 309 Communication During time period 5, only little information a nd guidance has been published. Thus, t he information and gu idance is only grouped around the theme: vaccination . Vaccination: Between December 2009 and August 201 0, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published regular updates on safety monitoring of vaccines and medicines used during the pandemic (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . In its update on pandemic medicines of 18 December, the EMA reaffirmed that the available data on the three pandemic vaccines and Tamiflu \u00ae showed no unexpected serious safety issues (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . On 21 December, the Spanish Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency (Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Med icamentos y Productos Sanitarios ; AEMPS ) issued official recommendations on the vaccination program. This document informed health professionals on the priority groups for vaccination, the specific pandemic vaccines and on aspects for vaccine administratio n Czech Republic Time period 1 Figure 31: Chronological overview of national and international events in the Czech Republic for time period 1 (01/04/2009 to 21/06/2009) International National 311 Situation The pandemic started in Veracruz, Mexico where an outbreak of influenza -like illness was recorded in early April 2009 (European Centre for Disease Preventio n and Control, 2010a) . A few days later several parts of Mexico reported further outbreaks of influenza -like illness. Analysis of samples detected an Influenza A virus but it was not possible to identify the subtype (World Health Organization, 2011) . In mid -April, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analyzed a sample from two children with respiratory illness in southern California, USA and identified the virus as a swine influenz a A/H1N1 virus (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009) . On 24 April WHO reported that virus isolates from Mexican patients were genetically identical to the new strain of swine influenza A/H1N1 virus discovered in California (World Health Organiza tion, 2009b) . On the same day ECDC published its first Threat Assessment saying that although the public health situation was still limited to Mexico and the US further vigilance was required in Europe to ensure the identification of the new virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009d) . One day later, on 25 April 2009, the first WHO Emergency Committee me eting was held. International experts came together to assess the situation in Mexico and the US and to advice the WHO Director -General, Dr. Margaret Chan, on response measures. The Committee reported more information on the clinical presentation, epidemio logy and virology of cases was needed, but concluded that the situation was of international concern. Thus, Dr . Margret Chan declared the outbreak in Mexico and the US as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under International Health Regulations (2005) and advised all countries to intensify surveillance for influenza -like illness and respiratory disease (World Health Organization, 2009c) . On the same day, the ECDC started to publish daily situation reports in which the current epidemiological situation was summariz ed. So far, 8 cases of pandemic A/H1N1 have been confirmed in the United States of America. In Mexico City 854 cases of pneumonia have been reported, including 59 deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , 2009e) . 312 Two days later, on 27 April, the first laboratory confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases have been reported in Europe, one in Spain and two in the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009f) . Based on available data on confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases in Mexico, the USA, Canada, and reports on suspected cases in other countries, the WHO Director -General raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 4 (World Health Organization, 2009d) . While phase 3 is cha racterized by sporadic cases and limited human - to-human transmission of an influenza reassortant virus, phase 4 is defined by confirmed human -to-human transmission of an influenza reassortant virus capable to cause sustained outbreaks in a community (World Health Organization, 2012) . The WHO Director -General, Dr. Margaret Chan, did not recommend any trade or travel restrictions and advised to center on mitigation measures as the containment of the outbreak was not considered to be feasible (World Health Organization, 2009d) . Two days later, on 29 April, the influenza pandemic alert was raised to phase 5 (World Health Organization, 2009e) . This was a signal that a pandemic was coming up and human to human spread of the virus into at least two countries of one WHO region was evident, namely Mexico and USA (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009h; World Health Organization, 2012) . In its first risk assessment, published on 30 April, the ECDC r eported missing information and data to define the seriousness of the potential pandemic. So far, the majority of pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disease and the case fatality rate was judged not to be different than for seasonal influenza (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009g) . At the start of the Sixty -second World Health Assembly on 18 May, members shared their experiences with the current outbreak of pandemic influenza A/H1N1. Altogether, 40 countries have reported 8829 confirmed cases of pandemic A/H1N1 (World Health Organization, 2009f) . On 25 May, the Czech Republic reported its first laboratory -confirmed case of pandemic A/H1N1 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009q) . In its risk assessment update on 20 Ma y, the ECDC again reported a continuing lack of data on parameters needed for right risk assessment. The ECDC considered available data and 313 stated that the pandemic A/H1N1 infections have been generally mild in Europe. Now there was more evidence that the virus was able to spread easily from one person to another and that it preferentially infected younger age groups. ECDC concluded that the spread of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus will continue (European Centr e for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009p) . On 11 June, the WHO raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 6, declaring a pandemic (World Health Organization, 2009h) . The severity of the pandemic was considered to be moderate by the WHO (World Health Organization, 2009i) . Surveillan ce On 30 April, the European Commission agreed on a common case definition for the European Union in order to detect cases of influenza caused by the new virus. This case definition is presented in Table 15 (see chapter 0). In the Czech Republic, the surveillance system to monitor influenza and other viral acute respiratory infections was active throughout the year and used the European Union case definition for influenza. Data were collected on a weekly basis and analysed at national level. The information was provided to the European Centre for Disease Preventio n and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) (Kyncl et al. ., 2013). Communication In order to give a better overview, the information published during time period 1 is grouped around the themes: personal protective measures, treatment of cases and control strategy. Personal protective measures: The ECDC provided information on European level. On 27 April, the ECDC published the first general questions and answers on pandemic A/H1N1 virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . In May, the EC DC published two documents on personal protective measures and information for travelers. The documents described personal protective measures to reduce the risk of acquiring influenza, i.e. regular hand 314 washing, respiratory hygiene, avoidance of close con tacts and mass gatherings (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009k, 2009m, 2009n) . On 21 May t ravel recommendations and recommendations on protective measures were published by the Czech Ministry of Health. This leaflet was based on information giv en by the ECDC. It informed about the symptoms of pandemic A/H1N1 infection and provided instructions on general hygiene measures to avoid pandemic A/H1N1 infection (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009a) . Treatment of cases: The use of antivirals in some groups involves particularities health professionals should know . Thus, on 8 May, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a guidance document on the use o f the antiviral medicine Tamiflu in children under one year of age and the antivirals Tamiflu and Relenza in pregnant and breastfeeding women in the case of an influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. The EMA stated that in the event of a pandemic Tamiflu can be used to treat children under the age of one and both antivirals can be used to treat pregnant women, as the benefits of their use outweigh their risks (European Medicines Agency, 2009a) . Control strategy: On 19 May, the ECDC published a guidance document on case and contact management. The recommended measures did not differ from the measures already applied in Germany, Spain and the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009o) . On 6 June, the ECDC published a guidance document on mitigation and containment strategies for national health authorities. ECDC stated that many public health measures are common in both strategies and the implementation of a mitigation strategy would mainly mean to move away from vigorous case finding and contact tracing. Further, the ECDC acknowledged that a containment strategy is very resource -intensive and therefore not a recommended infection control strategy for human influenza beyond pandemic alert phase 4 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009r) . 315 Time period 2 Figure 32: Chronological overview of national and international events in the Czech Republic for time period 2 (22/06/2009 to 02/08/20 09) National International 316 Situation In Czech Republic , the number of pandemic A/H1N1 cases has increased sharply until the peak of the first wave in week 32/2009. In its Threat Assessment, published on 1 July, the ECDC announced the first isolation of an oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu\u00ae) re sistant mutant A/H1N1 virus in Denmark. The virus was not a reassortant virus and was still susceptible to zanamivir (also known as Relenza\u00ae). There was no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to other persons. ECDC stated that this phenomenon is w ell-known in influenza viruses and emphasized the need for continued surveillance of this problem (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009u) . According to an ECDC risk assessment published on 20 July, 20 -30% of the population was expected to be affected over the first major wave of the pandemic. Clinical a ttack rates were expected to be highest in children and young adults. The estimate for h ospit alization rate s in Europe was 1 -2% and the case fatality rate was estimated to be 0.1 -0.2% of all clinical cases. ECDC stated that most cases experienced a mild and self -limiting illness, but people with chronic underlying medical conditions, pregnant wome n and young children were at higher risk of experiencing severe disease and deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009w) . Surveillance On 16 July, the WHO announced that cou ntries with community -wide transmission are no longer required to forward regular reports of individual confirmed cases to the WHO, as the detection, laboratory -confirmation and investigation of all cases is extremely resource - intensive and not sustainable for these countries (World Health Organization, 2009k) . Vaccination strategy As initial supplies of pandemic vaccine were limited, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization recommended that the following groups should be 317 prior itized for vaccination: health -care workers; pregnant women; individuals aged above six months with a chronic medical condition; healthy individuals aged between 15 years and up to 49 years; healthy children; healthy individuals aged between 50 years and u p to 64 years; and healthy individuals aged 65 years or above. The order of priority should be based on country -specific conditions (World Health Organization, 2009j) . Communication In order to give a better overview, the information published during time period 2 is grouped around the themes: control strategy, non -pharmaceutical response measures and treatment of cases. Control strategy: On 26 June, the WHO published a guidance document on public health measures to help countries manage the A/H1N1 pandemic. Besides giving general advice on response measures, the WHO provided additional advice for countries with widespread community - level t ransmission, for countries with no reported cases and for countries in transition. The WHO advised all countries to concentrate on mitigation measures, to prepare the health -care system for a high volume of patients and to ensure antiviral medicine and vac cine supply. In addition, countries with widespread community -level transmission were advised to cease laboratory -testing of all cases, to reduce the pressure on the health -care system, to primarily focus on the treatment of ill patients, and to consider s chool closures or the cancellation of mass gathering on a case -by-case basis. Countries with no reported cases were advised that they may consider entry screening at airports and contact tracing, but that these measures are resource intensive and of limite d benefit to prevent the spread of the disease. Countries in transition were advised to start the same control measures as countries with widespread community -level transmission (World Health Organization, 2009a) . Non-pharmaceutical response measures: On 20 July, the ECDC gave scientific advice on reactive and proactive school closures in Europe. ECDC highlighted that there is no consensus on the benefits from proactive school closures ( school closure before transmi ssion be tween the children occurs), but countries and schools were advised to at least have plans for reactive school closures (school closure when 318 many children and/or staff are experiencing illness) . These plans should consider the following issues: reco mmended length of time of closure; the triggers for re -opening; how to sustain teaching and learning; and potential problems that may arise for parents, if they have to take time off work (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009x) . Treatment of cases : On 31 July, the Ministry of Health published information on Relenza f or health professionals. This information was based on advice from the European Medicines Agency and contained the following recommendations: Relenza in the current situation was indicated for the treatment of diseases of proven influenza virus A (H1N1) in adults, adolescents and children over 5 years of age. It was not intended for prophylactic use. Treatment should have been initiated as soon as possible after the outbreak of flu symptoms and within 48 hours of onset of symptoms in adults and within 36 ho urs of onset of symptoms in children (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009b) . 319 Time period 3 Figure 33: Chronological overview of national and international events in the Czech Republic for time period 3 (03/08/2009 to 04/10/2009) National International 320 Situation Same as in the other countries, the virus continued to spread in Czech Republic, but at a low level over the summer. On 21 August, the ECDC published its planning assumptions for the first major wave of infection, which was expected to take place in the autumn and winter of 2009/2010. However, these planning assumptions did not differ from those published on 20 July (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ab) . In late September, the ECDC has reduced its planning assumptions. This decision was based on experience from Southern Hemisphere countries . It became more apparent that most pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disease; therefore hospitalization and case fatality rates were revised downwards (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ad) . Vaccination Strategy On 21 August, the Czech Republic decided to buy 1 million doses of Pandemrix from GlaxoSmithKline . First deliveries were expected in week 48/2009 (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009c) . On 29 September, the European Commission authorized the first two pandemic vaccines Focetria\u00ae (Novartis) and Pandemrix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline) for use in all Member States of the European Union and in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (European C ommission, 2009b) . Communication In order to give a better overview, the publications issued during time period 3 are grouped around the themes: personal protective measures, non -pharmaceutical response measures, treatment of cases and vaccination. 321 Personal protective measures: On 27 August, the Ministry of Health published a document on personal protective measures based on ECDC material. This document aimed to answer frequently asked questions on pandemic A/H1N1. It informed about symptoms of pandemi c influenza A/H1N1, ways of transmission, general hygiene measures, risk groups, and control measures (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009d) . About three weeks later, on 16 September, a poster on preventive measures was published (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009e) . Non-pharmaceutical response measures: In mid -Septem ber, the ECDC published a document on public health measures for policy and decision -makers (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . It provided scientific information on measures that may be applied t o reduce the impact of influenza pandemics (i.e. border closures, entry restrictions, personal protective measures, social distancing measures, use of antivirals and vaccines) and aimed to help EU countries to decide on appropriate response measures (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009a) . On 23 September, the WHO Emergency Co mmittee held its 5th meeting and agreed on continuing the following recommendations proposed by the WHO Director -General: borders should not be closed and travel and trade should not be restricted, countries should intensify surveillance of unusual events and people who are ill should postpone international travel (World Health Organization, 2009n) . Treatment of cases: On 18 August, the ECDC published general guidance on the use of antivirals during influenza pandemics. The document aimed to inform those deciding on antiviral use strategies about the effectiveness of antivirals, side effects of antivirals, priority group s for antiviral use and about necessary arrangements for antiviral delivery and administration (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009y) . 322 On 23 September, a document providing information on antivirals for health professionals was published. This document contained inf ormation on the use and dosage of antivirals, contraindications and side effects. According to this document, the prophylactic use of antivirals was not recommended (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009f) . Vaccination: Referring to medi a reports that have displayed concern about the safety of pandemic vaccine, the WHO has issued a note on pandemic vaccine safety on 6 August. In this statement the WHO outlined the procedures for approval and licensing of vaccines and confirmed that these procedures are strict and do include safety and quality controls. The WHO also stated that the data on influenza vaccine safety collected during the last 60 years do not show a special safety issue. Nonetheless, the WHO advised countries to closely monitor the safety and efficacy of the pandemic vaccine, as rare adverse events may only come to light when large numbers of people got vaccinated (World Health Organization, 2009l) . On 13 August, the ECDC published a document on the use of influenza pande mic vaccines during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The document aimed to inform those deciding on vaccination policies in the European countries on vaccine use and options for prioritization in order to maximize the benefit of available vaccine (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009z) . 323 Time period 4 Figure 34: Chronological overview of national and international events in the Czech Republic for time period 4 (05/10/2009 to 30/11/20 09) National International 324 Situation In early autumn, the numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 infectio ns have started to increase again, indicating the beginning of the expected autumn/winter wave. In the Czech Republic the second wave peaked around week 51 /2009 . On 26 October, the Czech Republic reported the first fatal case due to pandemic A/H1N1 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009af) . In its 7th risk assessment issued on 6 November, the ECDC has revised its planning assumptions . The followi ng EU reasonable worst case planning assumptions for the first year up to mid -May 2010 were published: clinical attack rate: up to 20% of population, hospitalization rate: up to 100 per 100.000 population and case fatality rate: up to 3 per 100.000 populat ion (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ag) . In late November, the Gallup Organization conducted a survey called the Eurobarometer in the 27 EU Member States, as well as in Norway, Switzerlan d and Iceland to examine public opinion about influenza and pandemic A/H1N1. 61% (N=1002) of Czech interviewees believed it was unlikely or rather unlikely that they would personally catch the A/H1N1influenza . Furthermore, 47% stated that is was not likely or not likely at all that they would get vaccinated against the pandemic A/H1N1 virus. Health professionals were the most trusted source to inform about pandemic A/H1N1. 83% mentioned that they trust health professionals mostly or completely (The Gallup Organization, 2010) . Vaccination strategy On 6 O ctober, the European Commission authorized a third pandemic vaccine, Celvapan\u00ae, for use in all EU Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009c) . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended a two dose schedule for all three authorized vaccines (European Medicines Agency, 2009b) . 325 On 23 No vember the Czech Republic started its vaccination program (O'Flanagan et al. ., 2011) . Three days later the decision on risk groups and vaccine schedules were publish ed. The pandemic vaccine was recommended for the following groups: Individuals with chronic conditions (e.g chronic heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, immunocompromised person), Individuals performing essential public service s and Healthcare workers. For these groups listed above a single -dose vaccine schedule was recommended, except for immunocompromised individuals where the vaccine was administered in a two -dose schedule (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009c, 2009j) . Communication In order to give a better overview the publications issued during time period 4 are again grouped around the themes: non -pharmaceutical response measures, treatment of cases and vaccination. Non-pharmaceutical response measures: On 26 November, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 6th meeting and agreed that delaying international travel was no longer recommended for ill persons, because pandemic A/H1N1 infections were already widespread (World Health Organization, 2009p) . Treatme nt of cases: On 16 November an information letter was sent to GP that informed about the start of the vaccination program and the Tamiflu distribution process (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009g) . On 20 November the Ministry of Health published Information on the amount of antivirals distributed to hospitals and recommended dosage of antivirals for children and adults (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009h) . Vaccination: On European level, information on vaccination was provided by the ECDC. In November the ECDC published questio ns and answers on vaccines for health professionals and for the 326 general public on its website (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009b, 2009c, 2010a) . On 19 November, the WHO issued a briefing note on pandemic vaccines in which the safety of the vaccines was reaffirmed (World Health Or ganization, 2009o) . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) did hold the same opinion. In a press release published on 20 November, the EMA reasserted the efficacy and safety of pandemic vaccines. Further, the EMA revised its advice on vaccine schedules and published the following recommendations: Pandemrix\u00ae and Focetria\u00ae may be used as a single dose in adults (18 -60 years) and in children and adolescents (Focetria\u00ae: from the age of 9 years; Pandemrix\u00ae: from the age of 10 years). Individuals aged over 60 yea rs may also receive one dose of Pandemrix\u00ae, but younger children and immunocompromised people should receive two doses (European Medicines Agency, 2009c) . On 20 November, information on the vaccination strategy, general conditions for the distribution and storage of vaccine, and the risk groups was published on the website of the Czech Ministry of H ealth (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009i) . 327 Time period 5 Figure 35: Chronological overview of national and international events in the Czech Republic for time period 5 (01/12/2009 to 15/04/20 10) International National 328 Situation The number of pandemic A/H1N1 infections decreased constantly in the Czech Republic. The end of the autumn wave was in end of January 2010. Afterwards only sporadic cases have been reported . On 4 December, the number of reported deaths in the Czech Republic raised to 22 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ai) . Three weeks later the number of reported deaths re ached 48 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009al) . In Mid -January 2010 the number of deaths had climbed up to 83 people in the Czech Republic (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010c) and reached a total of 98 by the end of March 2010 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010e) . In February 2010, evidence showed decreasing or low pandemic A/H1N1 activity in many countries, but the WHO Emergency Committee agreed that it was too early to conclude that the pandemic A/H1N1 virus has run its course. Thus, the pandemic influenza alert p hase was not changed (World Health Organization, 2010a) . On 10 August 2010, the WHO Emergency Committee assessed the global situation again. This time the Committee concluded that the world was entering the post -pandemic period (World Health Organization, 2010c) . Communication Durin g time period 5, only little information a nd guidance has been published. Thus, t he information and gu idance is only grouped around the theme vaccination. Vaccination: On 9 December, the Ministry of health published information on vaccination for the general public. This information was based on the ECDC material on vaccination (Ministerstvo zdravotnictv\u00ed R, 2009k) . Between December 2009 and August 2010, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published regular updates on safety monitoring of vaccines and medicines used during the pandemic (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . In its update on pandemic medicines of 18 329 December, the EMA reaffirmed that the available data on the three pandemic vaccines and Tamiflu \u00ae showed no unexpected serious safety issues (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . 330 Denmark Time period 1 Figure 36: Chronological overview of national and international events in Denmark for time period 1 (01/04/2009 to 21/06/2009) International National 331 Situation The pandemic started in Veracruz, Mexico where an outbreak of influenza -like illness was recorded in early April 2009 (European Centre for Disease P revention and Control, 2010a) .

On the same day, the ECDC started to publish daily situation reports in which the current epidemiological situation was summarized. So far, 8 cases of pandemic A/H1N1 have been confirmed in the United States of America. In Mexico City 854 cases of pneumoni a have been reported, including 59 deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009e) . 332 Two days later, on 27 April, the first laboratory confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases have been reported in Europe, on e in Spain and two in the UK (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009f) . Based on available data on confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases in Mexico, the USA, Canada, and reports on suspected cases in other countries, the WHO Director -General raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 4 (World Health Organization, 2009d) . While phase 3 is characterized by sporadic cases and limited human - to-human transmission of an influenza reassortant virus, phase 4 is defined by co nfirmed human -to-human transmission of an influenza reassortant virus capable to cause sustained outbreaks in a community (World Health Organization, 2012) . The WHO Director -General, Dr. Margaret Chan, did not recommend any trade or travel restrictions and advised to center on mitigatio n measures as the containment of the outbreak was not considered to be feasible (World Health Organization, 2009d) . Two days later, on 29 April, the influenza pandemic alert was raised to phase 5 (World Health Organization, 2009e) . This was a signal that a pandemic was coming up and human to hu man spread of the virus into at least two countries of one WHO region was evident, namely Mexico and USA (European Centre for Disease Prev ention and Control, 2009h; World Health Organization, 2012) . In its first risk assessment, published on 30 April, the ECDC reported missing information and data to define the seriousness of the potential pandemic. So far, the majority of pandemic A/H1N 1 cases experienced a mild disease and the case fatality rate was judged not to be different than for seasonal influenza (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009g) . On 1st May the f irst laboratory confirmed A/H1N1 case was reported in Denmark . The infected individual was infected in New York and came back to Denmark on 29 April (National Board of Health, 2009e) . In its risk assessment update on 20 May, the ECDC again reported a continuing lack of data on parameters needed for right risk assessment. The ECDC considered available data and stated that the pandemic A/H1N1 infections have been generally mild in Europe. Now there was more evidence that the virus was able to spread easily from one person to another and that it preferentially infected younger age groups. ECDC concluded that the spread of the 333 pandemic A/H1N1 virus will continue (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009p) . On 11 June, the WHO raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 6, declaring a pandemic (World Health Organization, 2009h) . The severity of the pandemic was con sidered to be moderate by the WHO (World Health Organization, 2009i) . As of 11 June Denmark has reported 11 cases of A/H1N1 , all of which have been relatively mild. By then, Infection in Denmark was still limited to persons who have been abroad and in some cases their immediate con tacts (National Board of Health, 2009g) . Surveillance On 30 April, the European Commission agreed on a common case definition for the European Union in order to detect cases of influenza caused by the new virus. This case definition is presented in Table 15 (see chapter 0). Due to the novel influenza virus A/H1N1 outbreaks, the sentinel surveillance of influenza in Denmark was maintained beyond the normal influenza season . GPs were encouraged to report the number of patients who have visited the GP and to take samples from patients fulfilling the A/H1N1 disease definition (Andersen, 2009b) . Control strategy and treatment of cases Initially, Denmark employed a containment strategy. Measures focused on limiting transmission of the virus or delaying the spread in order to gain time to apply effective response measures. This strategy included the following public health measures: those who met the clinical and epidemiological case definition were assessed through swabbing and laboratory testing; cases were treated with antivirals within 48 hours after onset of symptoms and requested to isolate at home or in hospital (depending on their clinical condition) until they were symptom -free; close contacts were traced and offered antiviral prophylaxis (Andersen, 2009a) . Furthermore the Danish National Board of Health recommended avoiding unnecessary travel to Mexico. But on 18 May this advice was lifted, partly by the fact that t he virus no longer primarily occurred in Mexico (National Board of Health, 2009f) . 334 Communication In order to give a better overview , the information published during time period 1 is grouped around the themes: personal protective measures, treatment of cases and control strategy. Personal protective measures: In April, the Danish National Board of Health published information leaflets on A/H1N1 for travelers. The leaflet informed on pandemic A/H1N1 symptoms, personal protective measures, travel recommendations and about what to do in case of symptoms (National Board of Health, 2009a) . In addition to the public information and advice o n national level, the ECDC provided information on European level. On 27 April, the ECDC published the first general questions and answers on pandemic A/H1N1 virus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . In May, the ECDC published two documents on personal protective measures and information for travelers. The documents described personal protective measures to reduce the risk of acquiring influenza, i.e. regular hand washing, respiratory hygiene, avoi dance of close contacts and mass gatherings (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009k, 2009m, 2009n) . On 1st May, the Danish National Board of health set up an information hotline for citizens who have questions about Influenza A (H1N1) (National Board of Health, 2009e) . Treatment of cases: The use of antivirals in some groups involves particularities health professionals should know . Thus, on 8 May, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a guidance document on the use of the antiviral medicine Tamiflu in children under one year of age and the antivirals Tamiflu and Relenza in pregnant and breastfeeding women in the case of an influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. The EMA stated that in the event of a pandemic Tamiflu can be used to treat children under the age of one and both antiviral s can be used to treat pregnant women, as the benefits of their use outweigh their risks (European Medicines Agency, 2009a) . 335 Control strategy: On 19 May, the ECDC published a guidance document on case and contact management. The recommended measures did not differ from the mea sures already applied in Denmark (European Centre for Dise ase Prevention and Control, 2009o) . On 6 June, the ECDC published a guidance document on mitigation and containment strategies for national health authorities. ECDC stated that many public health measures are common in both strategies and the implementa tion of a mitigation strategy would mainly mean to move away from vigorous case finding and contact tracing. Further, the ECDC acknowledged that a containment strategy is very resource -intensive and therefore not a recommended infection control strategy fo r human influenza beyond pandemic alert phase 4 (European Cen tre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009r) . 336 Time period 2 Figure 37: Chronological overview of national and international events in Denmark for time period 2 (22/06/2009 to 02/08/2009) National International 337 Situation The numbers of confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 cases increased constantly. In Denmark the numbers of infections continued to increase until the peak of the first wave in week. In its Threat Assessment, published on 1 July, the ECDC announced the first isolation of an oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu\u00ae) resistant mutant A/H1N1 virus in Denmark. The virus was not a reassortant virus and was still susceptible to zanamivir (also kn own as Relenza\u00ae). There was no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to other persons. ECDC stated that this phenomenon is well -known in influenza viruses and emphasized the need for continued surveillance of this problem (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009u) . According to an ECDC ri sk assessment published on 20 July, 20 -30% of the population was expected to be affected over the first major wave of the pandemic. Clinical a ttack rates were expected to be highest in children and young adults. The estimate for h ospitalization rate s in Europe was 1 -2% and the case fatality rate was estimated to be 0.1 -0.2% of all clinical cases. ECDC stated that most cases experienced a mild and self -limiting illness, but people with chronic underlying medical conditions, pregnant women and young children were at higher risk of experiencing severe disease and deaths (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009w) . Surveillance On 15 July, the Danish notification regulation of suspected cases was revised. The individual notification of suspected cases has been lifted and replaced by mandatory laboratory notification. The voluntary sentinel surveillance in primary health care which comprises submission of weekly reports and sa mples was in place throughout the year (Andersen, 2009c) . On 16 July, the WHO announced that countries with community -wide transmission are no longer required to forward regular reports of individual confirmed cases to the WHO, as the 338 detection, laboratory -confirmation and investigation of all cases is extremely resource - intensive and not sustainable for these countries (World Health Organization, 2009k) . Control stra tegy and treatment of cases Acknowledging that the containment of the pandemic A/H1N1 virus was no longer possible, the Danish Board of Health has decided to change its strategy for dealing with influenza A (H1N1) from 7 July 2009. The new strategy focused on the treatment of those who are at risk and preventive treatment for people at risk . From 7 July onwards only risk group patients or patients with a close contact to a risk group patient needed to be swabbed, antiviral treatment was initiated in risk gr oup persons only , prophylactic antiviral treatment was initiated in contacts to labora tory-confirmed cases provided the contact belonged to a risk group. People with one of the following conditions were defined as a risk group patient: chronic pulmonary co nditions, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, immunodeficiency, HIV - Infection, pregnant women (2nd and 3rd Trimester). Furthermore, it was recommended to closely monitor pregnant women in their 1st trimester, children < 5 years and severely obese patients (Andersen, 2009c; National Board of Health, 2009h) . Communication In order to give a better overview, the information published duri ng time period 2 is grouped around the themes: control strategy and non -pharmaceutical response measures. Control strategy: On 26 June, the WHO published a guidance document on public health measures to help countries manage the A/H1N1 pandemic. Besides gi ving general advice on response measures, the WHO provided additional advice for countries with widespread community - level transmission, for countries with no reported cases and for countries in transition. The WHO advised all countries to concentrate on m itigation measures, to prepare the health -care system for a high volume of patients and to ensure antiviral medicine and vaccine supply. In addition, countries with widespread community -level transmission were advised to cease laboratory -testing of all cas es, to reduce the pressure on the health -care system, to primarily focus on the treatment of ill patients, and to consider school closures or the cancellation of 339 mass gathering on a case -by-case basis. Countries with no reported cases were advised that they may consider entry screening at airports and contact tracing, but that these measures are resource intensive and of limited benefit to prevent the spread of the disease. Countries in transition were advised to start the same control measures as countries with widespread community -level transmission (World Health Organization, 2009a) . Non-pharmaceutical response measures: On 20 July, the ECDC gave scientific advice on reactive and proactive school closures in Europe. ECDC highlighted that there is no consensus on the benefits fr om proactive school closures ( school closure before transmission be tween the children occurs), but countries and schools were advised to at least have plans for reactive school closures (school closure when many children and/or staff are experiencing illne ss). These plans should consider the following issues: recommended length of time of closure; the triggers for re -opening; how to sustain teaching and learning; and potential problems that may arise for parents, if they have to take time off work (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009x) . 340 Time period 3 Figure 38: Chronological overview of national and international events in Denmark for time period 3 (03/08/2009 to 04/10/2009) National International 341 Situation The virus continued to spread, but at a low level over the summer . On 3 September, Denmark reported the f irst death from pandemic A/H1N1 infection of a Danish citizen in Norway (National Board of Health, 2009i) . On 21 August, the ECDC published its planning assumptions for the first major wave of infection, which was expected to take place in the autumn and winter of 2009/2010 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ab) . In late September, the ECDC has reduced its planning assumption. This decision was based on experience from Southern Hemisphere countries . It became more apparent that most pandemic A/H1N1 cases experienced a mild disea se; therefore hospitalization and case fatality rates were revised downwards (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ad) . Surveillance No surveillance strategy modifications were introduced during time period 3. Control strategy and treatment of cases No control strategy modifications were introduced during time period 3. Vaccination Strategy On 29 September, the European Commission authorized the first two pandemic vaccines Focetria\u00ae (Novar tis) and Pandemrix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline) for use in all Member States of the European Union and in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009b) . Communication In order to give a better overview, the publications issue d during time period 3 are grouped around the themes: non -pharmaceutical response measures, treatment of cases and vaccination. 342 Non-pharmaceutical response measures: In mid -September, the ECDC published a document on public health measures for policy and d ecision -makers (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010a) . It provided scientific information on measures that may be applied to reduce the impact of influenza pandemics (i.e. border closures, entry restr ictions, personal protective measures, social distancing measures, use of antivirals and vaccines) and aimed to help EU countries to decide on appropriate response measures (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009a) . On 23 September, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 5th meeting and agreed on continuing the following recommend ations proposed by the WHO Director -General: borders should not be closed and travel and trade should not be restricted, countries should intensify surveillance of unusual events and people who are ill should postpone international travel (World Health O rganization, 2009n) . Treatment of cases: On 18 August, the ECDC published general guidance on the use of antivirals during influenza pandemics. The document aimed to inform those deciding on antiviral use strategies about the effectiveness of antivirals, side effects of antivirals, priority group s for antiviral use and about necessary arrangements for antiviral delivery and administration (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009y) . On 1 October, the Danish National Board of health published a guidance document for physicians and other health professionals . The document informed that efforts are still focused on the prevention and treatment of patients at risk. Furthermore, it informed health professionals on general symptoms, risk groups, antiviral treatment of cases , prophylactic antiviral treatment of househol d contacts at risk and personal protective measures (National Board of Health, 2009j) . 343 Vaccination: Referring to media reports that have displayed concern about the safety of pandemic vaccine, the WHO has issued a note on pandemic vaccine safety on 6 August. In this statement t he WHO outlined the procedures for approval and licensing of vaccines and confirmed that these procedures are strict and do include safety and quality controls. The WHO also stated that the data on influenza vaccine safety collected during the last 60 year s do not show a special safety issue. Nonetheless, the WHO advised countries to closely monitor the safety and efficacy of the pandemic vaccine, as rare adverse events may only come to light when large numbers of people got vaccinated (World Health Org anization, 2009l) . On 13 August, the ECDC published a document on the use of influenza pandemic vaccines during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The document aimed to inform those deciding on vaccination policies in the European countries on vaccine use and op tions for prioritization in order to maximize the benefit of available vaccine (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009z) . 344 Time period 4 Figure 39: Chronological overview of national and international events in Denmark for time period 4 (05/10/2009 to 30/11/2009) National International 345 Situation In early autumn, the numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 infectio ns have started to increase again, indicating the beginning of the expected autumn/winter wave. In the Denmark the second wave peaked in week 46/2009 . In its 7th risk assessment issued on 6 November, the ECDC has revised its planning assumptions . The following EU reasonable worst case planning assumptions for the first year up to mid -May 2010 were published: clinical attack rate: up to 20% of population, hospitalization rate: up to 100 per 100.000 population and case fatality rate: up to 3 per 100.000 population (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009ag) . In late November, the Gallup Organization conducted a survey called the Eurobarometer in the 27 EU Member States, as well as in Norwa y, Switzerland and Iceland to examine public opinion about influenza and pandemic A/H1N1. 58% (N=1008) of Danish interviewees believed it was unlikely or rather unlikely that they would personally catch the A/H1N1influenza . Furthermore, 60% stated that is was not likely or not likely at all that they would get vaccinated against the pandemic A/H1N1 virus. Health professionals were the most trusted source to inform about pandemic A/H1N1. 90% mentioned that they trust health professionals mostly or completely (The Gallup Organization, 2010) . Surveillance In view of increasing numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 infections, the Danish National Board of Health changed its surveillance strategy. From 11 November onwards, laboratory testing was only recommended on suspicion of serious influenza disease requiring hospit alization (Andersen, 2009e) . Further, an active reporting system of influenza patients from a ll Intensive Care Units (ICUs) was set up b etween week 46, 2009, and week 11, 2010 (M\u00f8lbak et al. ., 2011) . Control strategy and treatment of cases During time period 4, no control strategy modifications have been implemented. 346 Vaccination strategy On 6 October, the European Commission authorized a third pandemic vaccine, Celvapan\u00ae, for use in all EU Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (European Commission, 2009c) . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended a two dose schedule for all three authorized vaccines (European Medicines Agency, 2009b) . On 23 O ctober, the Danish National Board of Health published the priority groups for vaccination. According to this document vaccination had to be offered to the following persons: individuals aged six months and above in a clinical at -risk group, pregnant women and household contacts to severe immunosuppressed patients. The vaccine used in Denmark was Pandemrix\u00ae. Unlike the European Medicines Agency, the Danish National Board of Health recommended a two dose schedule for all individuals in at -risk groups and for children aged between 6 months and nine years. For otherwise healthy individuals a one dose schedule was recommended (National Board of Health, 2009n) . From the beginning of November 2009 Denmark started its vaccination program. Due to limited supply of Pandemrix\u00ae, the Danish National Board of Health has therefore decided to vaccinate those at risk under 65 years first. This decision was based on exper ience from other countries showing that older people have a lower risk of catching pandemic A/H1N1 (National Board of Health, 2009l; O' Flanagan et al. ., 2011) . Communication In order to give a better overview the publications published during time period 4 are again grouped around the themes: personal protective measures, non -pharmaceutical response measures and vaccination. Personal protective measures: On 30 November, the Danish National Board of Health published information leaflets and posters on pandemic A/H1N1 in English and six widely used minority languages ( Arabic, Urdu, Bosnian, Turkish, Somali, Persian) . These leaflets aimed to inform about symptoms, 347 treatment and personal protective measures like regular hand -washing and respiratory hygiene (National Board of Health, 2009c, 2009d, 2009o) Non-pharmaceutical response measures: On 26 November, the WHO Emergency Committee held its 6th meeting and agreed that delaying international travel was no longer recommended for ill persons, beca use pandemic A/H1N1 infections were already widespread (World Health Organization, 2009p) . Vaccination: On 21 October, the Department of Epidemiology of the Danish National Board of Health published detailed information on Pandemrix\u00ae for health profe ssionals. The document informed about who should not be vaccinated, what the pandemic vaccine contains, how long the vaccine does protect, what side effects the vaccine has, how long the vaccine was tested, the practical handling and storage of the vaccine (Andersen, 2009d) . On European level, information on vaccination was provided by the ECDC. In November the ECDC published questions and answers on vaccines for health professionals and for the general public on its website (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009b, 2009c, 2010a) . On 19 November, the WHO issued a briefing note on pandemic vaccines in which the safety of the vaccines was reaffirmed (World Health Organization, 2009o) . The Europea n Medicines Agency (EMA) did hold the same opinion. In a press release published on 20 November, the EMA reasserted the efficacy and safety of pandemic vaccines. Further, the EMA revised its advice on vaccine schedules and published the following recommend ations: Pandemrix\u00ae and Focetria\u00ae may be used as a single dose in adults (18 -60 years) and in children and adolescents (Focetria\u00ae: from the age of 9 years; Pandemrix\u00ae: from the age of 10 years). Individuals aged over 60 years may also receive one dose of Pa ndemrix\u00ae, but younger children and immunocompromised people should receive two doses (European Medicines Agency, 2009c) . 348 Time period 5 Figure 40: Chronological overview of national and international events in Denmark for time period 5 (01/12/2009 to 15/04/2010) International National 349 Situation The number of pandemic A/H1N1 infections decreased constantly in Denmark. The end of the autumn wave was in early January 2010. On 9 December Denmark has reported 16 deaths of pandemic A/H1N1, including three outside risk groups (National Board of Health, 2009q) . By the end of the second wave in January 2010, Denmark has reported a total of nearly 5.000 confirmed pandemic A/ H1N1 cases, 30 deaths of pandemic A/H1N1 and 1.000 hospitalizations (Andersen, 2010b) . In February 2010, evidence showed decreasing or low pandemic A/H1N1 activity in many countries, but the WHO Emergency Committee agreed that it was too early to conclude tha t the pandemic A/H1N1 virus has run its course. Thus, the pandemic influenza alert phase was not changed (World Health Organization, 2010a) . On 10 August 2010, the WHO Emergency Committee assessed the global situation again. This time the Committee concluded that the world was entering the post -pandemic period (World Health Organization, 2010c) . Surveillance No surveillance strategy modifications were introduced during ime period 5. Control strategy and treatment of cases No control strategy modifications were introduced during ime period 5. Vaccination strategy In December Denmark extended its vaccination program. From the beginning of December Denmark started to offer the vaccine also to people at risk who are over 65 years old (National Board of Health, 2009l) . On 2 December the Danish National Board of Healt h adjusted its vaccination recommendations . From December on, only one dose of vaccine was recommended for patien ts at risk, unless they had a weakened immune system (Andersen, 2009f; National Board of Health, 2009p) . 350 By the end of week 48, Denmark has distributed nearly 500,000 vaccine doses, primarily to cover risk group vaccination (Andersen, 2009f) . On 12 February the Danish government decided to extend the vaccination program again. From Mid-February on the pandemic vaccine was also offered to people outside risk groups (National Board of Health, 2010) . Communication During time period 5, only little information a nd guidance has been published. Thus, t he information and gu idance is only grouped around the themes: vaccination and personal protective measures. Vaccination: Between December 2009 and August 2010, the European Medicines Age ncy (EMA) published regular updates on safety monitoring of vaccines and medicines used during the pandemic (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . In its update on pandemic medicines of 18 December, the EMA reaffirmed that the available data on the three pandemic vaccines and Tamiflu \u00ae showed no unexpected serious safety issues (European Medicines Agency, 2010) . Personal protective measures: On 18 December the Danish National Board of Health closed down its A/H1N1 information hotline . This decision was based on diminishing numbers of pandemic A/H1N1 infections. Citizens who had further questions on pandemic A/H1N1 were asked to look for information on the website of the National Board of Health or to contact their doctor (National Board of "}
