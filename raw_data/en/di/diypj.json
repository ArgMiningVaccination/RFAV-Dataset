A copy of the policy is available on the portal for members to examine for an understanding of how and under what circumstances your insurance applies. If there are any portions of your policy that you do not understand, please contact us for an explanation. Some but not all, of the policy exclusions are summarized below: Energy Medicine activities are defined as the evaluation and manipulation of the human energy field, using the client's or practitioner's energy field to effect a change in the client's energy field and overall mental emotional physical or spiritual health.A common misconception is that coaching is the same as therapy, when in fact they are quite different. This insurance program is for coaching and not therapy. Therapy (counseling or psychotherapy) is intended to help people recover from emotional or other psychological disorders such as depression or anxiety. Therapy is a long-term process in which a client works with a healthcare professional to diagnose and resolve problematic beliefs, behaviors, relationship issues, feelings and sometimes physical responses. Therapist are licensed professionals. Coaching, on the other hand, is intended to help normal, healthy individuals achieve personal goals such as increased happiness, weight loss, improved work-life balance. etc. In coaching, a client works with a coach who is not a healthcare professional to clarify goals and identify obstacles and problematic behaviors in order to create action plans to achieve desired results. Misrepresentation of activities outside the scope of the policy as covered constitutes fraud and will void the insurance.
