Left unaddressed, chronic stress can even increase your risk of conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, depression, and anxiety, according to the [National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/so-stressed-out-fact-sheet). That's right: Stress isn't just making you grumpier \u2014 it may also be making you sicker. Today, after living through the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/covid-19/), transitioning to working from home, and facing increased work and family demands, many of us are more stressed than we've ever been. With those sudden and inconvenient changes can come a whole lot of stress, which at times feels unrelenting. Even in prepandemic times, Americans were stressed. For Everyday Health's [United States of Stress](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/united-states-of-stress/) survey in 2019, of the nearly 6,700 people queried, 35 percent rated their stress at 6 or 7 on a scale of 1 to 7 over the previous month. We also asked respondents how they deal with stress, and among the various coping mechanisms they could choose from, 22 percent of people reported turning to food. How Your Diet Can Affect Stress Levels, for Better or Worse The good news? Whenever you feel you have little control, one thing you can get a grip on is your diet choices. And these choices can make or break your [stress levels](/stress/guide/causes/). Let's put it this way: Those cookies and potato chips aren't doing you any favors. [Ali Miller, RD, CDCES](https://www.alimillerrd.com/), an integrative dietitian in Houston and the author of The Anti-Anxiety Diet, says that refined carbs spike blood sugar then cause it to crash, increasing stress and anxiety. Healthy foods \u2014 including healthy fats such as [avocados](/diet-nutrition/diet/avocados-health-benefits-nutrition-facts-weight-loss-info-more/), eggs, and walnuts \u2014 have the opposite effect, creating a \"favorable hormone signaling in the brain, which supports satiety, mood regulation, and sleep and energy balance,\" Miller says. An urge to make a beeline for the vending machine when stress is sky-high isn't your fault. When you're stressed, your body pumps out hormones that rev your appetite and send your cravings for unhealthy comfort foods soaring, according to [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-stress-causes-people-to-overeat). Meanwhile, stress can lead to a loss of lean muscle mass, which decreases your metabolism and increases your risk of weight gain. Of course, that's only part of the equation. From sleep, diet, and exercise to work, family, and romantic relationships, stress can take a toll on every aspect of your life. Fortunately, there's a solution \u2014 and we can show you the way. To build the ultimate stress-busting diet, we came up with a detailed food list and 14-day meal plan that's specifically balanced to meet all your nutritional needs while calming your stress hormones, increasing feel-good hormones, and keeping your energy high. We also offer some expert-backed tips and tricks that we hope will help you tame your stressors once and for all. Preparing healthy food may be the last thing you want to do when you're pressed for time and strung out. But rest assured that your time and effort will pay off in a big way \u2014 and you'll likely notice the benefits of this plan when your stress levels are at their highest. What you'll potentially be getting out of this plan: more energy, a calmer mind, a boosted immune system, and maybe even a slimmer waistline. Need we say more? The Best and Worst Foods Proven to Affect Stress Management W hen stress strikes, the body releases the hormones cortisol, insulin, and ghrelin, which can ramp up hunger and cravings for [unhealthy foods](/diet-nutrition/top-10-worst-foods-you-should-give-up/), notes [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-stress-causes-people-to-overeat#:~:text=Stress%20eating%2C%20hormones%20and%20hunger&text=High%20cortisol%20levels%2C%20in%20combination,stress%20related%20responses%20and%20emotions.). If the [stressful event](/stress/guide/) continues, those hormones remain elevated, increasing levels of another hormone, called leptin, which helps your body recognize when it's full. These hormonal changes can raise your risk for a condition called leptin resistance, which [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2967652/) suggests is linked to obesity. Fortunately, knowing which foods to fuel up on (and which to skip) can help you get your stress levels under control. Next, learn about the research that suggests how. Foods to Eat When You're Stressed Warm, Soothing Foods For conquering stress, a food's nutrient profile may be just as important as how it makes you feel. Take a calming, warm cup of tea, for instance, says [Sandra Meyerowitz, MPH, RD](https://www.smartnutritionworks.com/), an online nutrition coach and the owner of Nutrition Works in Louisville, Kentucky, who specializes in food sensitivities, [food allergies](/digestive-health/experts-how-do-food-allergies-affect-digestion.aspx), and nutrigenomics. Sipping a warm drink has a soothing effect regardless of the flavor \u2014 but certain herbs have been shown to have a relaxing effect on their own, Meyerowitz says. For example, [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3600416/) suggests chamomile may reduce anxiety by helping rewire the body's stress response and increasing the production of the feel-good hormones serotonin and [dopamine](/dopamine/). Dark Chocolate Usually, dessert isn't a good choice when you're stressed, but [dark chocolate](/diet-and-nutrition-pictures/delicious-reasons-to-eat-dark-chocolate.aspx) may be an exception. This treat can reduce stress in two ways \u2014 via its chemical impact and its emotional impact. Chocolate feels like such an indulgence that it can be a real treat to simply savor a piece of it, and that feeling alone can reduce stress, says Meyerowitz. Dark chocolate, which is also rich in antioxidants, lowers stress hormones in the body, according to [one study](https://pubs.acs.org/stoken/presspac/presspac/full/10.1021/pr900607v) in which participants ate about 1.5 ounces (oz) of the treat per day for two weeks. Just be sure to avoid excess calories in your diet by not overindulging, Meyerowitz advises. The calories in dark chocolate can add up quickly, so stick to a 1 oz serving or less per day and choose chocolate that's at least 60 percent cacao. Whole-Grain Carbohydrates Low-carb [keto diet](/diet-nutrition/ketogenic-diet/) followers, act as stress busters! According to [MIT](http://news.mit.edu/2004/carbs), carbohydrates can increase [levels of serotonin](/serotonin/guide/), a chemical in the body that helps boost mood and reduce stress. More serotonin means more concentration and a more productive workday. But picking the right carbs is critical. Refined carbs \u2014 such as chips, cookies, and crackers \u2014 are tied to inflammation, stress, and depression, according to [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2868080/). These carbs may also raise your blood pressure, straining heart health, suggests [a review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449852), and lead you to overeat later in the day, other [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10049982) suggests. [Complex carbs](/diet-nutrition/diet/good-carbs-bad-carbs/), on the other hand, can do wonders for your stress levels because they digest more slowly and keep blood sugar levels more even, according to [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/nutritional-strategies-to-ease-anxiety-201604139441). Sources of complex carbs include sweet potatoes and whole grains (such as whole-grain bread, [quinoa](/diet-nutrition/diet/quinoa-nutrition-facts-types-how-cook-it-more/), brown rice, and oats). Bananas For a quick pick-me-up, skip Starbucks and reach for a banana instead. The yellow, [potassium](/pictures/foods-high-in-potassium/)-rich fruit contains the mood-boosting chemical dopamine, along with magnesium, levels of which plummet during stressful times. A [preliminary study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390804002588) found that magnesium deficiency increased [depression and anxiety](/anxiety/anxiety-and-depression.aspx) symptoms in mice. Similarly, a [review in the December 2020 Nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7761127/) noted a direct link between magnesium deficiency and increased stress levels. Bananas are furthermore a rich source of certain B vitamins, such as [vitamin B6](/drugs/vitamin-b6), which helps the nervous system run correctly, and can decrease stress and fatigue, according to [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2885294/) that looked at the use of high-dose B-complex vitamins. An added perk: The potassium bananas offer can help lower high blood pressure, according to [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/potassium-lowers-blood-pressure). Fatty Fish Stress can tax the heart, but noshing on fatty fish can help strengthen your ticker and boost your mood, to boot. Heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids in whole fish like tuna, halibut, salmon, and sardines may help ease depression, [one review](https://jech.bmj.com/content/70/3/299) found. Lowering overall stress and anxiety is another possible benefit, according to [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4540034/). Water Looking for a quick and simple way to ease stress? Fill your cup with water and sip away! The importance of hydration during stressful times is well documented. Even mild [dehydration](/news/unusual-signs-of-dehydration/) can increase [cortisol levels](/cortisol/guide/), which contributes to increased stress, as [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10585169?access_num=10585169&link_type=MED&dopt=Abstract) describes. While drinking enough water will not make your stressors vanish, taking this step will help set your body up to handle stress when it does happen. According to the [National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine](http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2004/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-Water-Potassium-Sodium-Chloride-and-Sulfate.aspx), the average woman needs about 2.7 liters of water per day, while the average man needs about 3.7. (About 80 percent of that hydration should come from beverages, whereas the remaining 20 percent can come from food.) To calculate your personal fluid needs, give a [hydration calculator](https://www.everydayhealth.com/dehydration/hydration-calculator/) a try! Milk (or a Nondairy Alternative) Your mom might have been onto something when she made you drink all your milk at the dinner table. Turns out, calcium might not only strengthen your skeleton \u2014 it could also brighten your mood. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23346303) found that Korean women who consumed the least calcium reported feeling the most depressed. Milk and other dairy as well as nondairy products with calcium and added [vitamin D](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/vitamin-d) can help muscles relax and stabilize mood; [another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5313351/) suggests these nutrients may even ease symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, which are stressful on their own. Nuts Nuts are a boon to your health in more ways than one. First, they're satiating, meaning they can help ward off unhealthy cravings. Second, they could help lower blood pressure, according to [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22665124) that focused on pistachios. And third, Meyerowitz says, their B vitamins have been shown to help lower stress levels. Remember to reach for only a small handful, as nuts are calorie dense and can lead to weight gain if you eat too many. Oranges and Other Vitamin C-Rich Fruits [Vitamin C](/diet-nutrition/vitamin-c/) will not only ward off scurvy \u2014 the nutrient can also keep stress at bay. [One small randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11862365) found that when people took 3,000 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C in a slow-release formula each day, their cortisol levels, and overall stress, decreased. Citrus fruits, including oranges, [grapefruit](/diet-nutrition/diet/grapefruit-nutrition-benefits-types-side-effects-more/), and strawberries, are a good start, but you would need a supplement to reach such high levels of these nutrients. Speak with your doctor before adding vitamin C supplements to your diet. Avocados Guac out to your heart's content. Avocados are packed with healthy monounsaturated fats, vitamin C, vitamin [B6](/diet-nutrition/benefits-of-vitamin-b6.aspx), potassium, and fiber, making for a perfect stress-fighting snack. As mentioned, vitamins C and B6 can help reduce stress, and the fruit's potassium may help lower blood pressure. Not to mention, the healthy fat and fiber in avocados can help contribute to satiety, discouraging you from unhealthy snacking when you're stressed, according to a [study published in the October 2018 FASEB Journal](https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.31.1_supplement.433.6). Dark, Leafy Greens You might think desk salads are boring, but for lowering stress, they may be one of the best choices you can make at lunchtime. Leafy-green vegetables, such as spinach and [kale](/diet-nutrition/diet/kale-nutrition-health-benefits-types-how-cook-more/), as well as other raw fruits and veggies, are stress-busting powerhouses, as a [study published in a 2018 issue of Frontiers in Psychology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5902672/) described. As a rich source of magnesium, leafy greens can help regulate cortisol and blood pressure levels. Plus, green leafy veggies contain folate, according to data from the [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/323505/nutrients), which plays a key role in the production of the feel-good chemical dopamine, notes [past research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18950248/#:~:text=Folate%20is%20a%20water%2Dsoluble,serotonin%2C%20epinephrine%2C%20and%20dopamine.). Foods to Limit or Avoid When Stressed Of course, not all foods are good for stress levels. In fact, some foods (or too much of them) may actually make matters worse. Knowing what to put on your plate is just as important as knowing what to skip for lower stress levels. Caffeine Your cup of joe could support or sabotage your stress levels. It comes down to volume and timing. \"There's nothing wrong with a couple of cups of a caffeinated beverage earlier in the day, but skip it after noon, as it can interfere with sleep,\" says [Evelyn Tribole, a dietitian in Newport Beach, California. Beverages such as caffeinated coffee or tea can help improve mental focus when taken in small amounts, but drinking too much may have unintended effects. \"Too much [caffeine](/drugs/caffeine) can make you feel anxious, jittery, and more stressed than you actually are,\" adds [Molly Kellogg, LCSW, RD](http://www.mollykellogg.com/about-molly/), a psychotherapist and dietitian in Philadelphia. Alcohol Be mindful of your alcohol intake, as it could similarly help or hurt your stress levels. \"If someone has any tendency to overdo it, alcohol is a bad idea,\" says Kellogg. When stress is an ongoing issue and someone continues to turn to alcohol to calm their nerves, it can actually contribute to a feeling of depression and make stress more difficult to manage in the long term. [Clearview Treatment Programs](https://www.clearviewtreatment.com/depression-symptoms-alcohol) notes it's better to abstain from alcohol if you're feeling depressed or think you lean on it too much. It's also important to note that alcohol can be a major contributor to many chronic health conditions. In fact, a [study published in the September 2018 Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31310-2/fulltext) found that alcohol is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Refined Sugar \"Avoid taming stress with sugar,\" advises Miller. Refined sugar, which is the kind in cookies, cakes, and candy, causes blood sugar to soar and then quickly drop (often described as a \"crash\"). This is the opposite of what you need when your stress levels are high and your energy levels are low. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05649-7) found that increased intake of refined sugar may also raise the risk of depression. Stress-Free Grocery Shopping List T here are two parts to the equation when it comes to grocery shopping to decrease stress. First, planning ahead and knowing what you're going to buy at the store can directly cut back on the amount of stress that grocery shopping can bring. (Who knows? With a good enough list, you may even be able to send someone else in your place!) Second, making a shopping list allows you to be mindful of the foods that will fill your home. Stock up on these healthy foods so you're prepared when stress strikes. Stress-Fighting Pantry Staples - Olive oil - Whole grains (for example brown rice, whole-grain pasta, quinoa, barley, farro) - Oats (avoid those with added sugar) - Dark chocolate (60 percent cacao or greater) - Unsalted nuts (especially [almonds](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/almonds-nutrition-benefits-how-eat-more/), walnuts, cashews, seeds, sunflower seeds, [flaxseed](/diet/flaxseed-what-superfood-offers-how-add-it-your-diet/), [chia seeds](/diet-nutrition/diet/chia-seeds-nutrition-health-benefits-how-cook-more/)) - Decaf tea (especially black, green, and chamomile) Fresh Stress-Busting Ingredients A 14-Day Sample Stress-Buster Menu N ow you know what foods are best (and worst) for stress and how to fill your fridge and cupboard. But how does it all come together into the meals you choose to eat each day? Tastes and schedules will vary from person to person, but here's an outline of two weeks of meal ideas to fight stress. Day 1 Breakfast Old-fashioned oatmeal with skim milk, [blueberries](/diet-nutrition/diet/blueberries-nutrition-health-benefits-recipes-more/), and mixed unsalted nuts Lunch Turkey and avocado lettuce wrap Snack An orange and pistachios Dinner Salmon with broccoli and farro Dessert A glass of warm milk Day 2 Breakfast Plain nonfat yogurt with cherries and unsalted [almonds](/diet-nutrition/diet/almonds-nutrition-benefits-how-eat-more/) Lunch Chicken and wild rice soup Snack An apple and a part-skim cheese stick Dinner Chicken and veggie stir-fry over brown rice Dessert One square of dark chocolate Day 3 Breakfast 2 eggs (any style) and a slice of whole-grain toast Lunch A salad topped with chicken and avocado Snack Carrot sticks and hummus Dinner Turkey tacos Dessert A cup of decaf tea Day 4 Breakfast Overnight oats with cocoa powder, peanut butter, and banana Lunch Quinoa and black bean salad Snack Air-popped popcorn Dinner Grilled chicken with barley and spinach Dessert Berries with whipped cream Day 5 Breakfast Whole-grain pancakes with fresh berries Lunch Chicken and veggie wrap Snack Kale chips Dinner Tuna roll with brown rice Dessert Avocado chocolate pudding Day 6 Breakfast 1 egg with avocado toast Lunch Lentil soup Snack Celery sticks with peanut butter Dinner Roasted turkey breast with roasted carrots and quinoa Dessert Blueberries Day 7 Breakfast Quinoa fruit salad Lunch Stuffed peppers with seasoned ground turkey, brown rice, and veggies Snack Pumpkin seeds Dinner Shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce Dessert Baked apple Day 8 Breakfast Yogurt parfait with plain nonfat yogurt, fruit, and granola Lunch Veggie and hummus wrap Snack Guacamole with multigrain tortilla chips Dinner Baked trout with tomatoes and mushrooms over brown rice Dessert Dark-chocolate-covered strawberries Day 9 Breakfast Chia pudding with cocoa powder and walnuts Lunch Bunless veggie burger on a bed of spinach Snack Whole-grain toast with ricotta and raspberries Dinner Steak fajita bowl Dessert Melon with plain nonfat yogurt Day 10 Breakfast Steel-cut oatmeal with apples and cinnamon Lunch Spinach salad topped with solid white albacore tuna in water Snack A glass of milk Dinner Butternut squash soup Dessert A cup of chamomile tea Day 11 Breakfast French toast with whole-wheat bread and warm berries Lunch Grilled cheese on whole-grain bread with tomato soup Snack A banana with peanut butter Dinner Chicken with roasted potatoes and veggies Dessert Poached pear Day 12 Breakfast Trail mix and a cup of tea Lunch Kale chicken Caesar salad Snack Almonds Dinner Grilled salmon with asparagus with brown rice Dessert Dark-chocolate-covered banana Day 13 Breakfast Small bran muffin and nonfat yogurt Lunch Minestrone soup Snack Hard-boiled egg Dinner White bean and spinach quesadilla on a whole-wheat tortilla Dessert Strawberry shortcake Day 14 Breakfast Whole-wheat toast with nut butter and banana slices Lunch Mason jar salad Snack Red pepper sticks with hummus Dinner Veggie chili Dessert Warm unsweetened applesauce Tips for Eating During Times of Stress Eat Regular Meals If you couldn't already tell, stress can seriously mess with your hunger cues. One underlying cause is the body's fight-or-flight mode, which is a reaction to a situation that's perceived as dangerous, according to the [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/fight-or-flight). \"When our bodies go into fight-or-flight mode during times of stress, it can actually shut down feelings of hunger,\" says Tribole. \"It's like a broken gas tank. It may say 'full' all of the time, but if you rely on that, you may not make it to your destination.\" When this happens, you may not sense hunger until you finally sit down, and by then, you may be starving \u2014 causing you to overeat or cause you to overeat or choose less nutritious foods. To help combat this effect, Tribole and Kellogg recommend not going more than four hours or so without having something to eat. Have Healthy Snacks on Hand Stress management is all about preparation. If you don't have time to eat a full meal, be sure to have healthy snacks on hand so you aren't tempted to reach for junk food. For example, stock your work desk with almonds, pack a banana with your lunch, or store precut veggie sticks in your fridge. Have a Routine (and Stick to It!) A steady schedule each week reduces stress. Think of it this way: When you don't have to figure out what you're going to eat; where, when, and how you're going to break a sweat; and when you're going to go to bed, there's less guesswork involved, and you're more likely to stick with your plan. Bonus? You might also lose weight. [A small study](https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/481138) found that setting daily habits and adhering to them helped people keep the weight off for a year. As much as possible, keep everything the same each week, even the day of the week that you go grocery shopping and the healthy go-to foods you always keep stocked in the house, Kellogg says. (See below for what should be in your kitchen!) Eat Mindfully Being more mindful has a slew of health benefits \u2014 reduced stress among them. Studies suggest that mindfulness can lower not only stress levels but also emotional exhaustion, depression, and anxiety, according to a [review in a 2018 issue of PLoS One](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5783379/). That's why it's so important to be mindful when we're eating. That means no scrolling through Instagram, Facebook, or your email when your plate is in front of you. A growing body of research suggests being mindful may help with weight loss, too. [Other research, in the February 2018 Obesity Reviews](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29076610), found that participants in mindfulness programs had lost an average of 6.8 to 7.5 pounds at follow-up. Be Flexible When Needed Allow yourself the flexibility you need when you're stressed without finding fault with yourself. \"It doesn't have to be a gourmet meal every day. Maybe you eat the same simple thing every day for a week, buy takeout, or eat off of paper plates because that's where your energy level is,\" Tribole says. \"You don't make or break your nutrition in one day or one week \u2014 it's what you do over a lifetime.\" Being kind to yourself and doing the best you can will ultimately help reduce your stress levels. How Registered Dietitians Reduce Stress in Their Lives Amy Gorin, RD, CDCES Tips for Dealing With Stress A number of different strategies can help you deal with stress. What works for one person may not work for another and vice versa. The key is to change \"small, realistic things \u2014 and remember that it doesn't have to be perfect,\" Tribole says. \"Find one thing that works for you and makes you feel centered.\" Here are some other tricks for coping with stress. Prioritize Self-Care When we're stressed, we tend to put our own needs last on our to-do list. It's not uncommon for people to skip meals or miss out on other important aspects of [self-care](/self-care/). Instead, try taking a minute to step back and figure out what you need. Tribole advises shifting your perspective: \"What would you do for your dog?\" she says. We always make sure that our pets are well cared for \u2014 that they eat on time and have everything they need to be comfortable, so why not do ourselves the same favor? Delegate or Let Go Stress tends to come alongside a very long list of tasks we feel obligated to complete. Take a look at your list and ask yourself, \"Can it wait or can I delegate?\" says Tribole. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by everything you have to accomplish by the end of the day, Kellogg recommends thinking about what you can do less of today. Whether it's mindless scrolling on Instagram or staying up late to binge-watch Netflix, we all have nonessential, potentially stressful activities that we can cut back on. Get Enough Sleep Sufficient quality sleep is one of the pillars of good stress management. \"Poor sleep can make us more stress responsive, and it also increases one's appetite for high-fat, high-sugar foods,\" says [Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, PhD](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/neurological-institute/researchers/janice-kiecolt-glaser-phd), the director of the Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research at the Ohio State College of Medicine in Columbus. When sleep-deprived, the body loses its ability to regulate hunger appropriately. In fact, [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18564298) suggests a single night of sleep deprivation can significantly increase the hunger hormone ghrelin. Similarly, a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3259) found that sleep deprivation also increases cravings for high-calorie foods as a result of increased activity of the primal brain, which kicks in to help the body \"survive\" stressful periods. \"Poor sleep also means you're less likely to exercise \u2014 and lose all the [benefits of exercise](/fitness-pictures/amazing-benefits-of-exercise.aspx), which include better moods and greater [resilience](/wellness/resilience/) when under stress.\" [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17846259) found that exercise was comparable to treatment with [antidepressants](/antidepressants/guide/) in patients with depression. For optimal health, the [National Sleep Foundation](https://sleepfoundation.org/excessivesleepiness/content/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need-0) recommends adults shoot for seven to eight hours of sleep per night. Exercise Regularly Fitness is typically one of the first things to go when we're stressed. That's a shame, as exercise can help reduce stress and promote sleep. In fact, according to the [National Sleep Foundation](https://sleepfoundation.org/ask-the-expert/how-does-exercise-help-those-chronic-insomnia), even one bout of moderately intense exercise helped [people with chronic insomnia](/insomnia/why-cant-sleep-insomnia-both-acute-chronic-explained/) fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer the night of the day they exercised. ( [Chronic insomnia](/insomnia/what-when-you-cant-sleep-all-about-insomnia-treatments/) means someone has trouble sleeping at least three nights per week for at least one month, whereas acute [insomnia](/insomnia/guide/) involves sleep troubles that are less frequent over a shorter period of time.) These two facts make exercise crucial during busy periods of life. \"Exercise that is moderate but consistent is shown to be helpful in coping with stress and not letting the stress hormones get out of hand,\" says Kellogg. According to the [Harvard School of Medicine](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/exercising-to-relax), when you exercise, the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline decrease, while [endorphins](/endorphins/guide/), which act as natural painkillers and mood boosters, are simultaneously released. This results in natural stress reduction. Kellogg also recommends finding a way to integrate exercise into your day rather than thinking of it as another thing you're adding to your schedule. For example, instead of worrying about fitting in 30 minutes or more of exercise each day, Tribole recommends doing what you can, when you can. \"Go for a 10-minute walk or stand or switch positions every 60 to 90 minutes. Stand when talking on the phone instead of sitting,\" says Tribole. \"These small changes can really add up!\" Find Your Breath Literally! \"Rapid heart rate and [shortness of breath](/breathing-difficulty/guide/) are two of the most common physiological responses to anxiety. Interestingly enough, breath is one of the most powerful ways to control the autonomic nervous system,\" says Miller. Take the time to take a deep breath during a moment of stress or find one minute to sit quietly and focus on your breathing. Either way, you'll be giving your body what it really needs. Practice Mindfulness and Meditation Mindfulness and meditation may seem like buzzwords, but they are actually practices rooted in ancient times. Mindfulness is so helpful for dealing with stress that entire training programs are dedicated to teaching mindfulness tactics. According to [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27890474), programs may help decrease emotional eating, but more research is needed to know for sure. Lean on Friends and Family \"The support provided by close personal relationships is really key,\" says Dr. Kiecolt-Glaser. The problem is that we tend to isolate ourselves and limit time with others when stressed \u2014 and this response tends to compound stress.\" [A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563217300559) found that in-person support helped people cope better during times of stress \u2014 and text messages didn't have the same effect. Being aware of the tendency to pull away from others when stressed is a good first step, but breaking the pattern can be difficult. Try telling those around you that you need their support. They may be able to spot your stress earlier than you do and jump in to help before you even know you need it. Managing Stress in the Long Run U nfortunately, stress is not something you can eliminate. It will ebb and flow with time, and there will always be times of high stress. So it's important to have a plan in place to deal with that stress and limit its effect on your life as much as possible. Think about the foods you want to focus on and those you want to avoid when stress levels are especially high. Stock your pantry so you're ready to go whenever a bout of stress may hit.
