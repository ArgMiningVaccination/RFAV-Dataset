At H\u00e4lsa Naturopathic Medicine, we strive to optimize your child's health and prevent the future development of chronic disease. We believe in doing more than simply treating your child's symptoms. We listen to you to determine the underlying causes. We then provide gentle, safe, and effective recommendations and treatments to restore health naturally, without medications when possible. Our compassionate, collaborative approach offers you, as a parent, a safe forum to discuss your child and your medical decisions, and results in individualized treatment plans that work for your child and your family. We want your child to thrive! Pediatric visits at H\u00e4lsa include discussing nutrition and lifestyle choices, how to prevent common illnesses, how to address common and more complex childhood health problems, vaccinations, developmental milestones, and what to expect in the months and years to come. Bring your questions to these visits and we will discuss your child, your interests and your concerns in depth.
