(MHA) to create the Pharmacy Partnership for Long -Term Care (LTC) Program , to offer on - site COVID -19 vaccination services for residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the United States. Since launching in mid -December 2020, the Pharmacy Partnership for LTC Program has successfully completed three on-site vaccination clinics in each facility and administered over 7.8 million doses of COVID -19 vaccines to LTCF staff and residents.1 LTCF residents are defined by CDC as adults who live in facilities that provide a variety of services, including medical and personal care, to people who are unable to live independently. Making sure LTCF residents receive COVID- 19 vaccination as soon as vaccine is available will help save the lives of those at highest risk for infection and severe illness from COVID -19.
