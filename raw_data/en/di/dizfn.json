Many patients have come forward to share their stories of challenge and triumph. Allergies Anxiety ADHD Focused at School and Symptom Free Sydney is 12 years old and came to Tao of Wellness after struggling with her school work and anxiety for 6 months. She had difficulty falling asleep at night and experienced fatigue every day. At school, she couldn't concentrate which caused her anxiety, and lowered her confidence. Her pediatrician diagnosed Sydney with ADHD but Sydney's mother wanted to use a more natural method than prescription medication to help Sydney with her symptoms. Sydney and her mother had a consultation at Tao of Wellness and Sydney was prescribed herbs to calm her nerves, clear her mind, and boost her energy. At night, she took a separate herbal formula to help with sleep. Sydney followed a dietary guideline which eliminated refined sugar, gluten, artificial flavors and colors, and preservatives. She began seeing the benefits after her first treatment. She found the acupuncture very relaxing and often fell asleep during her sessions. Sydney's energy began to improve and so did her sleep. After a few weeks, Sydney and her mother noticed her focus at school started improving. After 3 months of regular treatment, Sydney no longer needed treatments and stayed symptom free. Performing Beyond Expectations Judy is a 16 year-old girl who has grown up in a culture of high academic expectations. She struggled with her 4-5 hours of nightly homework while receiving B's and C's on her tests and report cards. This understandably worried her parents, who took her to be evaluated. Her diagnosis was ADHD and Judy was prescribed Ritalin, which her mother was reluctant to give to her daughter. She brought Judy to the Tao of Wellness. During the first visit Judy described how she would have trouble waking up in the morning and would find herself unable to focus during her first period Spanish class, and the lack of concentration would last through the rest of her school day. According to her mom, Judy was moody and tired, especially when she came home from school. She was on the soccer team and after school there would be a 2-hour practice or game to attend. After dinner she would sit down to do her homework and study, which would last until well past midnight. We had Judy and her mother provide a diet journal that turned out to be very revealing. Judy's breakfast was a donut and orange juice eaten in the car on her way to school, lunch was usually a turkey sandwich, and her afternoon snack before soccer practice would consist of potato chips, a granola bar, and a fruit rollup. Dinner was with the rest of the family and she would usually have rice, vegetable, soy products, fish and poultry. Around 10pm, in the middle of her studies, she would have a couple scoops of ice cream. It was obvious to us that Judy was suffering from hypoglycemia and kidney/adrenal exhaustion, much of it caused by her diet and lifestyle. Immediately we changed her diet. We had Judy remove sugar and refined carbohydrates, and focus on lean proteins and vegetables for breakfast and lunch. We had Judy eat her carbohydrates before her game in the afternoon and at dinner. Her breakfast changed to eggs, plain yogurt and almond milk. Her lunch became mostly salmon, chicken, or bean salad. We advised her to eat mixed nuts for her midmorning snack and have humus, banana and rice milk before her afternoon soccer. We didn't change her dinner since it was reasonably healthy but we substituted mixed berries and yogurt for her nightly snack of ice cream. Besides dietary change, we insisted that she go to bed by 10:30 and we wrote her teachers a note to excuse her incomplete homework for the first 4 weeks of her treatment course. We recommended that Judy undergo a 3-month treatment course of acupuncture to increase her cognitive function. We gave her a customized herbal formulation to help support her brain function and circulation of nutrients and oxygen. Additionally, we gave Judy dietary supplements to support her adrenal and blood sugar functions. The changes were dramatic. One month into her treatment course Judy was able to finish her homework almost every night by her new bedtime. She became more engaged and focused in class and the comments from her teacher illustrated that she was a different girl. Even her soccer coach gave positive feedback that she was more energetic and enthusiastic. Her tests were coming back with A's and B's. And her semester grades, which coincided with the conclusion of her 3-month treatment course, were the best she's had since beginning high school. We continued to monitor Judy's progress and to see her monthly for maintenance acupuncture treatments. It's now been more than 1 year and Judy has stayed on her nutrition program. Her course load has increased with Advanced Placement classes but she is still managing to complete her work and get into bed by 11pm on school nights. Her parents are very pleased with her progress and recently reported that she scored above 2300 on her SAT test. Autoimmune Conditions Cancer Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Back to Living a Full, Normal Life Donna is 35 years old and had constant fatigue, muscle and joint pain throughout her body, and difficulty performing even simple tasks such as reading. She was unable to think clearly or concentrate for any length of time. She dragged herself through life even though she appeared normal from the outside. This caused her further frustration because the people around her could not understand why she was unable to function normally. Prior to coming to Tao of Wellness, Donna had seen many specialists without being able to get any help for her symptoms. After her initial consultation and assessment at our clinic, it was clear Donna's problem stemmed from a lingering viral infection that was weakening the digestive and adrenal systems. Donna was given an anti-inflammatory eating plan, a qi gong routine to practice daily, weekly acupuncture, and a custom Chinese herbal formula designed to carry out the viral toxins while reducing inflammation and improving digestive and adrenal function. After 6 months, Donna reported her fatigue and symptoms had reduced 95% and that she was back to living a full and normal life. Cold & Flu A Rare Cold is Quickly Reversed Rochelle is 69 years old and came into our office having suffered a cold for several days. At her age, she didn't get colds very often. We were certain to treat her right away to ensure her system remained strong. She was suffering from sinus congestion, cough, and runny nose, and she was concerned about having to take a couple of days off her exercise routine. Rochelle was given acupuncture treatment and was given our tonic oil, made of wintergreen, camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus, to add to boiling water to breathe in the steam so the sinuses would open and drain. Rochelle was provided with an herbal nasal spray that included magnolia flower, xanthium fruit, and angelica root. She was also given a customized herbal formula that included herbs to support the immune system and reduce inflammation and mucus production. Finally she was advised to avoid sugar, dairy, and white flour until the cold abated. Rochelle had been coming to us for many years for a variety of health issues, so treating a cold in this way was a special experience for her. She reported relief of symptoms within a couple of days after her treatment. Quickly Back to Work Paloma is 39 years old, and for 2 days, had onset of chest congestion, a sinus headache, runny nose, and cough with thick, yellow mucus. She has a very demanding job, so it was important for her to get better as quickly as possible. Once we determined that Paloma was suffering from a cold virus she was treated with acupuncture and was given a custom herbal formula designed to expel the cold virus, reduce inflammation of mucus membranes, and resolve phlegm accumulation in the upper respiratory tract. She was happy to report that the cold was resolved within days of the treatment Cough & Asthma Breathing Deeply Again with Tai Chi Susan is 67 years old and suffers from bronchiectasis, which is the destruction and widening of the large airways of the lungs, and leads to chronic scarring, profuse mucus, cough, and infection. She came in for acupuncture to relieve her inflammation. The result was quite favorable and encouraging. At the same time, Susan discovered tai chi. Through her regular tai chi practice, she was able to finally feel the depth of her breath, the power of her body, and the grace of her movements. After such a long time of feeling weak and short of breath, Susan felt alive again. With the chronic nature of bronchiectasis, Susan is susceptible to periodic flare-ups but her symptoms are manageable now with her regimen of tai chi, herbal medicine, and acupuncture. Chronic Bronchitis Stopped in its Tracks Janeane is 50 years old and had been struggling with bronchitis for 6 weeks when she came in for a consultation. Upon meeting her, she was very frustrated and worried, since she had never had a cough this long before. Janeane was using a steroid inhaler, codeine cough syrup, and a cough suppressant for the duration of her illness without sustained relief. Since she hadn't gotten relief we had her stop taking the cough suppressant and suggested an anti-inflammatory eating plan. We treated her with acupuncture in addition to a Chinese herbal formula designed to moisten and thin out the thick mucus so that it was more easily expelled. The next day Janeane reported noticeable relief and by the following week her bronchitis symptoms had subsided. Severe Asthma Under Control 5 year old Taylor was brought to us by his parents as he'd been suffering from severe asthma since he was 1 year old. He had a frequent, dry cough and suffered asthma attacks so severe that he was regularly hospitalized and given steroid treatments. Taylor also suffered from severe eczema (an autoimmune disorder affecting the skin). After examining Taylor we began treating him with pediatric acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine to relieve inflammation and mucus. At first, the acupuncture involved a momentary stimulation of acupoints, with the therapy lasting only a few seconds. After a few months, Taylor was able to receive 30-minute long acupuncture sessions as he watched cartoons on his parent's iPad. We also advised his parents on some basic dietary guidelines to prevent asthma attacks, such as avoiding sugar, gluten, and dairy products. After some time he no longer required regular treatments but continued to take a customized maintenance herbal formula. Asthma attacks would infrequently occur, but both the asthma and eczema were much milder and better managed using Chinese medicine. Taylor is now a happy 8 year old who lives a very active normal life. Treating Respiratory Infection With Their Own Hands Jake Nuesca is an active third grader who plays in a garage band, bikes, runs, plays ball, does yoga and studies tae kwon do. When he was an infant, Jake had severe breathing problems, was hospitalized and diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). He was started on an Albuterol inhaler, but even with thrice-daily treatment, Jake's breathing kept getting worse. By the time he was five, Jake was put on anti-inflammatory steroids. Jake's mother, Leslie, was worried about the side-effects of inhalers and steroids, so she took him to an osteopath who placed Jake on a wheat-, dairy-, soy- and corn-free diet. Still, Jake continued to need medications to help him breathe easily. Leslie brought Jake in for treatment with Andrea Thorpe, L.Ac. at the Tao of Wellness. Jake was not able to tolerate herbs, so Andrea treated him with acupuncture, cupping and gua-sha (a Chinese medical treatment where parts of the body are lubricated, pressured and scraped with a rounded object.) Andrea also taught Leslie how to do simple gua-sha treatments on Jake, using eucalyptus oil and the edge of a spoon. Leslie says, \"We were able to keep cutting back on medication, and now he hasn't needed it for two years.\" Today, Leslie brings Jake in for \"tune-up\" treatments, especially during times of respiratory challenge like proximity to a furry pet Digestive Disorders Infertility Interstitial Cystitis Symptom-Free After 10 Years Sara had been suffering from interstitial cystitis (IC) for over 10 years when she came to Tao of Wellness. She experienced recurrent episodes of pelvic discomfort, frequent and urgent urination as well as fatigue, allergies, eczema, anxiety, and pain in her neck and shoulders. She had been taking a prescribed medication for her IC symptoms but discontinued it after suffering its side effects. She began her weekly acupuncture and daily herbal therapy at Tao of Wellness and immediately began feeling better. As her stress level, sleep pattern, and diet fluctuated, her IC symptoms also fluctuated during the course of her treatments. With careful monitoring, fine adjustment of treatments, and lifestyle modification, Sara has been able to gain comfort and control. Thanks to this, Sara is now symptom-free from her IC. High Cholesterol Cholesterol Dropped Over 50% Tricia is 48 years old and arrived at our office with a total cholesterol reading of 405, over double the normal limit. She showed signs of insulin resistance and had gained weight around her belly. Tricia was also experiencing menopausal symptoms of hot flashes, night sweats, and an irregular menstrual cycle. She was initially put on statin drugs by her cardiologist for two months. Tricia's cholesterol began to drop but her liver enzymes became elevated, a side effect of the statin drugs and a sign of liver inflammation, so she was taken off the statin. Her treatment consisted of high-fiber, low-cholesterol diet, daily cardiovascular exercise, and acupuncture and Chinese herbal therapies to strengthen Tricia's digestive, metabolic and hormonal functions. We continued her treatment course for another three months without the statin medication and Tricia's cholesterol dropped to 178, well under the maximum of 200. As a bonus, her period came back and she lost 23 pounds over the course of 3-4 months. Detox program lowered cholesterol by 50 points in a month Nancy is a 55 year-old philanthropist who traverses the globe regularly. As a result of her extensive travels and inconsistent diet she is often tired, feels bloated and overweight and her total cholesterol had shot up to 230 and her LDL was at 160, which was abnormally high for her historically. She refused to take medication and turned to Tao of Wellness to help her lower her cholesterol. Her doctor was pressuring her into taking statin drug and gave her a month to lower her LDL naturally so she opted for our Cleansing and Detox program that involved diet and nutrition, acupuncture and herbal therapies and regularly exercise. At the end of one month she returned to her internist and her blood test results showed total cholesterol had dropped a whopping 50 points and her LDL had gone from 160 to 125, within normal rage. Additionally, Nancy lost 10 lbs within that month and has managed to keep the weight off and her cholesterol normal Pain Back to Regular Hiking with Strong Legs Bruce is 64 years old and complained of chronic knee and thigh pain. When not at his desk job, Bruce enjoys hiking and nature photography. However his pains have kept him from doing his exercise. Since starting his acupuncture regimen his pain has reduced substantially, his strength has increased, and his range of motion in his legs has improved. He's also been instructed on proper posture when working at his desk and how to care for his legs before, during, and after each hike. Each time he goes for a strenuous hike he comes back for more treatment, responding well each time. Overcoming Disk Degeneration in the Office and the Garden Garett is 35 years old and came to us with sharp, burning pain starting in his back and radiating down his leg. It had flared up for a few weeks but had been with him for a couple years by this point. His MRI showed an intervertebral disc in his low back was degenerating and herniating or pinching the spinal cord, causing his pain. Garett was used to being active, doing lots of heavy lifting at work, and working in his garden. With the pain, his physical activities were compromised. We discussed and showed him methods of safe lifting and optimum body mechanics when doing physical work. His treatment plan consisted of 6 acupuncture treatments, twice per week for the first two weeks and once per week for the following two weeks. His treatment plan also consisted of herbal therapy, nutritional counseling, and the use of herbal topical on the affected areas. At the conclusion of his course of treatment Garett was very satisfied with his improvements. He had minimal discomfort, felt stronger, and became more productive at work and was back at his garden on the weekends. Less Muscle Spasm Helped with Graduate School Rachel is a 40-year-old woman who had chronic muscle spasm and pain in her neck, shoulders, and back regions. This was made worse by her recent increase in studying for an entrance exam to graduate school. She had been receiving physical therapy but was getting only temporary relief. Her orthopedist referred Rachel to our offices for treatment. Rachel completed 8 weeks of acupuncture and Chinese herbal therapy designed to reduce inflammation, improve circulation, and promote healing. Rachel reported consistent relief that was cumulative each week with each acupuncture treatment. With her pain level much improved, Rachel expressed that she was much more effective in her study and preparations. Recovery from a Life of Spinal Stenosis Tricia is 63 years old and has had severe pain in her neck, upper back, and lower back for a good deal of her life. The MRI confirmed Tricia had spinal stenosis which is a narrowing of her spinal canal, constricting her spinal cord. In addition, her intervertebral disks were bulging and compressing the spinal nerve roots. These and other factors likely developed over decades of working as a dentist with poor posture. Besides instructing her on ways to maintain better posture and improved ergonomics we also referred her to a physical therapist to help her strengthen her abdominal core and other muscles to further support her weak back. Tricia initially received acupuncture three times weekly for 3 months in her first course of treatment. This greatly reduced the severity and frequency of her pain, making her daily life much more manageable. For the second course of three months of treatment, Tricia came in once weekly and stabilized to the point where she could work and live with minimal discomfort. Now Tricia comes periodically for maintenance and preventative care. Stephanie Sweat Out All Her Pain Several years ago, Stephanie came into our office with acute pain in her neck, shoulders, elbows, knees, and back. At the outset she felt she had caught the flu with the usual accompanying body aches but instead of gradually fading away, her pain only grew as time went on. She felt increasing pain in her neck that would shift locations in the mornings to include her elbow or her knees. Stephanie saw her internist who initially advised pain relievers like Motrin and Advil. And when the pain got worse, he switched her to a prescription anti-inflammatory medication. Her pain did not get better and continued to shift from one joint to another. She struggled to cope with the pain for three weeks without any relief before she came to Tao of Wellness. After examining her we determined that Stephanie's pain was caused by a pathogen that needed to be expelled. Her treatment plan consisted of acupuncture and cupping, along with vigorous tuina bodywork to stimulate energy, increase blood flow, and induce sweating to expel toxins. We also sent her home with a customized herbal formula to help support her immunity and fight off the invading pathogen that was the trigger of her arthritic pain. We asked her to take a hot bath with tonic oil. That night after the bath she sweated profusely, and per our instructions, she drank plenty of water to keep herself adequately hydrated. The very next morning her pain became drastically decreased. She returned for a follow-up treatment three days later and woke up the next morning with her pains completely subsided. It has not returned since Pediatric Care Pediatric Cold & Flu No More Drugs or Monthly Colds Kevin is 7 years old and has caught a cold almost every month. Each time he got sick, it quickly settled into his chest and caused bronchitis and asthmatic episodes for which his pediatrician prescribed breathing treatments and steroid medications. His mother was concerned about having him use steroid medications so often. Kevin had to take many days off from school, which made him feel depressed. He came to Tao of Wellness and, after his consultation, we initially focused on treating a lingering cough from his most recent cold. Kevin was given acupuncture on his back, neck, arms and legs. Kevin was also given a custom Chinese herbal formula in tincture form that included pinellia, poria, tangerine peel, and apricot kernel to reduce bronchial inflammation, cough, and congestion. Kevin's nutritional recommendations to improve lung function and clear out excessive mucus included avoiding sugar, dairy, and wheat while recommending broccoli, cauliflower, apples, pears, Asian pears, and soups. After one treatment his cough went away and he no longer needed his steroidal medication or breathing treatment. We then advised his mother to bring Kevin in at the first sign of his next cold. Kevin came in a few weeks later with a sore throat and a mild cough. We began the treatments immediately. Within the week, his cold resolved and did not turn into bronchitis or lead to asthma. Over the next 6 months, Kevin got only two cold, and his mother brought him in at the first sign. Each time his symptoms went away quicker. Recurrent Ear Infections Gone Dylan is 13 months old. Three months ago, he started getting recurring colds that always turned into ear infections. He was put on antibiotics each time by his pediatrician. When his mother brought him to our clinic, Dylan still had symptoms of an ear infection even after his recent antibiotic treatment. Dylan was fussy and irritable. His mother was also frustrated that his ear infection had been difficult to manage and slow to heal. After his initial evaluation, Dylan was given a custom treatment plan. His pediatric acupuncture involved momentary stimulation of points on his neck, arms, and legs. Dylan received herbal drops for his ears that included antibacterial and antiviral herbs. He also received oral drops to reduce inflammation and improve immune function. Dylan's nutritional recommendations included avoiding sugars, fruit juice, cow dairy, and wheat while focusing on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, soups, and easy-to-digest protein like chicken, turkey, and fish. After his first week of treatment, Dylan's ear looked much better with less swelling and redness, and he was no longer fussy and irritable. Over the next three months Dylan continued his treatment and successfully prevented further colds and ear infections from returning. As a management plan for Dylan's future, we advised his mother to bring him in when she notices the first sign of a cold Pregnancy Skin Conditions Very Quick Eczema Recovery Cassandra is two years old and came to Tao of Wellness with eczema on her face, neck, arms, legs, hands, and feet. Her skin was red, dry, thick, and extremely itchy. Cassandra would itch to the point of bleeding. She would also get very irritated and the inflammation and itchiness would interrupt her sleep. She also had a chronic low-grade fever as a result of all the inflammation. During the day, Cassandra was tired and fussy as a result of all of this. Her parents were desperate, had tried other doctors and steroid creams to no avail, and had heard about our work through a friend. Cassandra's tongue showed clear inflammation as it was red, with red spots all over her tongue, indicating her blood was having a hard time dealing with something circulating inside her, and her body was trying to push it out through the skin. Cassandra had been dealing with this every day since food was first introduced when she was 6 months old. Allergy tests indicated she should avoid a long list of foods. Her parents limited her diet but it didn't help. We learned that Cassandra was still eating sugar, dairy, and wheat and we immediately told her to stop these as they were likely causing a lot of the problems with her immune system. Cassandra's parents were reluctant primarily as they had other children and they knew it would be difficult to have Cassandra eat a specific diet very different from everyone else's in the household. Before Cassandra left, we gave her pediatric acupuncture, which comprised of painless stimulation of several points on her body. She sat calmly during the one minute treatment. We sent Cassandra home with a topical herbal cream in addition to Chinese herbal tinctures designed to heal the skin and reduce immune hyperactivity. Children tend to respond quickly and Cassandra's case was no different. Three days later and she was already 50% better. She was sleeping through the night, her mood was much better and she no longer had a chronic low-grade fever. Most importantly, her skin was less swollen, less red, and almost completely free of the itchiness, which allowed her scabbed skin to start healing. Cassandra's tongue redness was far reduced as well. After acupuncture treatments were administered twice per week for two weeks, Cassandra was almost completely in remission. She had absolutely no itching, was adjusting to the new eating plan just fine, had no problems taking her herbal drops, and only had minimal pink tones to the affected areas of her skin. She has since moved to once weekly treatments and will soon move to a wellness phase in which we'll treat her monthly to ensure that her condition does not relapse. As a benefit, Cassandra's parents decided the other children were going to eat this healthier diet as well Sleep Disorders Healthy Sleep Restored After Cancer Kathy is 44 years old and came to Tao of Wellness after finishing her chemotherapy and radiation for breast cancer. After her cancer treatments she suffered from insomnia for three months. She had difficulty falling asleep as well as staying asleep. She also experienced night sweats. In Kathy's case, cancer treatment affected her hormonal system, and the imbalance lead to insomnia. She received weekly acupuncture and a customized Chinese herbal formula which she took daily. After a few weeks of treatment, she was able to sleep better and her night sweats resolved. By the end of three months of treatment, Kathy was able to sleep without any difficulty or interruption, and her healthy sleep was restored. Sleep Restored and Anxiety Diminished John is 55 years old and came to Tao of Wellness hoping to alleviate his chronic insomnia and anxiety. He had been working at a stressful job for many years as an executive in a big corporation. John had difficulty falling asleep, and suffered from frequent waking throughout the night. During the day, anxiety and excessive worrying took over his mind. A customized Chinese herbal formula was prescribed for John and he received weekly acupuncture. After 2 treatments, John started to fall asleep easier and woke up less during the night. After three months of regular treatment, his sleep was restored and his anxiety was drastically reduced. John continued to receive acupuncture and herbal medicine for a second three month period at a reduced frequency. He was then able to sleep without herbal medicine or acupuncture, and anxiety episodes became almost non-existent. Urinary Disorders Symptom-Free After 10 Years Sara had been suffering from interstitial cystitis (IC) for over 10 years when she came to Tao of Wellness. She experienced recurrent episodes of pelvic discomfort, frequent and urgent urination, as well as fatigue, allergies, eczema, anxiety, and pain in her neck and shoulders. She had been taking prescribed medications for her IC symptoms but discontinued them after suffering side effects. She began her weekly acupuncture and daily herbal therapy at Tao of Wellness and immediately began feeling better. As her stress level, sleep pattern, and diet fluctuated, her IC symptoms also fluctuated during the course of her treatments. With careful monitoring, finely adjusting her treatments, and modifying Sara's lifestyle, she has been able to regain comfort and control. Thanks to this holistic approach, Sara is now symptom-free from her IC. Weight Wellness A Much Healthier Body and Eating Plan Lucy is 47 and came to Tao of Wellness wanting to lose 20 pounds. She was overweight and admitted to having a horrible diet that consisted of a lot of cheese, pastries, and other baked sweets. Lucy did exercise three times per week for an hour each but her nutrition kept her chronically overweight. After her initial consultation, Lucy received an acupuncture treatment designed to curb her appetite and stimulate water metabolism. She also received a custom herbal formula with magnolia bark, orange peel, sprouted barley, and hawthorn fruit to help digest the food leftover in her digestive system in addition to increasing the breakdown of excess fat. We put Lucy on a nutrition plan of vegetables, fruits, proteins except red meat, and whole grains except wheat. We had her avoid refined sugars and cheese and instead recommended berries and nut butters as a substitute that would quench her sweet and salty cravings. After her first week, her cravings subsided and she lost 8 pounds. This is definitely above average in terms of a first week's weight loss but many people will notice water weight accounts for a lot when strengthening these metabolic functions. Over the next 3 months Lucy lost between 1 and 3 pounds each week as she kept up her exercise, nutrition, acupuncture, and herbal regimens. At this point Lucy had lost 16 pounds, she was feeling great, and her body mass index was in a perfect range. Then Lucy visited her family in Europe over the winter holidays, completely lost track of her nutrition, and gained 8 of those pounds back. Lucy's family was use to eating a diet heavy in meat, cheese, potatoes, and bread, and Lucy had no other options. She ate admittedly too much of all the foods that caused her weight to rise in the first place. But when she got back into town she got back on her treatment and nutrition plan again and brought her weight all the way down to losing a total of 17 pounds. Lucy now comes less regularly to maintain her much healthier body "}
