Intradermal administration was shown to be safe in adults with latent TB infection (LTBI), but data are lacking for aerosol-delivered candidate TB vaccines in this population. We carried out a Phase I trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of MVA85A delivered by aerosol in UK adults with LTBI (NCT02532036). Two volunteers were recruited, and the vaccine was well-tolerated with no safety concerns. Aerosolised vaccination with MVA85A induced and We identified several i..
