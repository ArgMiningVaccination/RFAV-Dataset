Sincerely, -r~~~Ted Gallagher Associate Regional Administrator Application for a \u00a71915(c) Home and C ommunity-Based Services Waiver PURPOSE OF THE HCBS WAIVER PROGRAM T he Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) waiver program is authorized in \u00a71915(c) of the Social Security Act. The program permits a State to furnish an array of home and community-based services that assist Medicaid beneficiaries to live in the community and avoid institutionalization. The State has broad discretion to design its waiver program to address the needs of the waiver's target population. Waiver services complement and/or supplement the services that are available to participants through the Medicaid State plan and other federal, state and local public programs as well as the supports that families and communities provide. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recognizes that the design and operational features of a waiver program will vary depending on the specific needs of the target population, the resources available to the State, service delivery system structure, State goals and objectives, and other factors. A State has the latitude to design a waiver program that is cost-effective and employs a variety of service delivery approaches, including participant direction of services.

In one page or less , briefly describe the purpose of the waiver, including its goals, objectives, organizational structure (e.g., the roles of state, local and other entities), and service delivery methods. n mlkj i n mlkj g fedc g fedc fedc g fedc g fedc g fedc The purpose of the DDS Waiver, a 1915(C) waiver, is to assist service participants in leading healthy, independent and productive lives to the fullest extent possible; promote the full exercise of their rights as citizens of the District of Columbia; and promote the integrity and well-being of their families. Services are provided with the goal of promoting independence t hrough strengthening the individual's capacity for self-care and self- sufficiency. This waiver creates the fiscal platform for a service system centered on the needs and preferences of the participants and supports the integration of the participants w ithin their communities. The DDS serves to provide an on-going opportunity for individuals with developmental disabilities to transition from ICFs-MR and provide residential and other comprehensive supports for people with complex needs. The objectives of the MRDD Waiver are to: 1. Promote independence for participants through the provision of services meeting the highest standards of quality and national best practices, while ensuring health and safety through a comprehensive system of participant safeguards; 2. Offer an alternative to institutionalization and costly comprehensive services through the provision of an array of services and supports that promote community inclusion and independence by enhancing and not replacing existing informal n etworks; 3. Support participants and their families to exercise their rights and share responsibility for their programs regardless of the method of service delivery; and 4 . Offer access to services on a short term basis that would protect the health and safety of the participant if the family or other care giver was unable to continue to provide care and supervision. The Medical Assistance Administration (MAA) is the Single State Medicaid Agency that maintains administrative and supervisory oversight of the MRDD Waiver. MAA designates the authority for implementing the program(s) and for programmatic oversight of the waiver to the Department of Disability Services, through an interagency agreement. Services are accessed through a single point of entry within DDS. Initially, applicants are assessed by the DDS Clinical Services Team, who determines eligibility. All applicants enter the DDS gateway in a \"pending\" status. When DDS makes the determination to deliver the service to the applicant, the participant chooses between ICF-MR and HCBS services. Delmarva, a private entity contracted by MAA, assesses those who choose ICF/MR services. Those participants who have chosen the HCBS option are processed by DDS, which includes a level of care determination. All waiver participants choose their Direct Service Provider Agencies through the Freedom of Choice process. All services must be prior authorized and delivered in accordance with an approved Plan of Care. The Plan of Care is approved by DDS.

DDS established a D istrict-wide Stakeholder Group solely for the purpose of giving input into the waiver. The Group included representation by people with developmental disabilities, providers, family members and local advocacy organizations such as the federally-funded Protection and Advocacy organization and the Quality Trust [note: the Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities, Inc. (Quality Trust) is an independent, nonprofit advocacy organization created to advance the individual and collective interests of people with developmental disabilities and mental retardation in the District of Columbia. The activities of Quality Trust include monitoring the adequacy of services available including ensuring health, safety and welfare issues are addressed, providing lay advocacy services and ensuring access to legal representation. The Quality Trust was established by a court order in the Evans Settlement Agreement in 2001. All meetings were held in an open-meeting format. The Group was tasked by DDS w ith the responsibility of relaying information about the waiver to their constituents and bringing feedback to DDS from these constituents, thus promoting two-way communication. The Stakeholder Group was invaluable throughout the waiver development process, most especially in the areas of service definitions, quality management (including participant protections), Plan of Care, rate-setting and rule issues. DDS has traditionally hosted a monthly Waiver Committee, a small work composed of representation similar to the Stakeholder Group. This Committee reviewed each iteration of the draft waiver throughout its development and focused on all aspects of the waiver. Day-to-day development of the waiver included a representative of the aforementioned Quality Trust, who worked closely with officials from the Medical Assistance Administration and the Department of Disability Services.

The new service array has been developed in a manner that will result in no change to current waiver participant's service provider, service amount or intensity by substituting new services that encompass the functions of the support received through the discontinued services; assuming the service provider agrees to enroll to deliver the alternative service. Prior to the transition, the service types, amounts and intensity for each participant will be mapped to the new service options. Each participant will receive written notification of the service changes at least two weeks prior to the transition date, complete descriptions of the new service definitions, and new service authorizations will be prepared by DDS. Each participant will be given an opportunity to request a meeting to discuss the proposed service changes with his/her case manager. If a participant wishes to change the service array or select a new waiver service option he/she may request an ISP meeting at any time per ISP policy.

I n four pages or less, describe the process that is used to develop the participant- centered service plan, including: (a) who develops the plan, who participates in the process, and the timing of the plan; (b) the types of assessments that are conducted to support the service plan development process, including securing information about participant needs, preferences and goals, and health status; (c) how the participant is informed of the services that are available under the waiver; (d) how the plan development process ensures that the service plan addresses participant goals, needs (including health care needs), and preferences; (e) how waiver and other services are coordinated; (f) how the plan development process provides for the assignment of responsibilities to implement and monitor the plan; and, (g) how and when the plan is updated, including when the participant's needs c hange. State laws, regulations, and policies cited that affect the service plan development process are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable): participant in contacting the team members with the date, location and time of the meeting. Additionally, this meeting is used to assist the participant in reviewing their progress in meeting the previous year's goals. The participant's preferences, needs, goals and desires for the next year are discussed. Finally, the Case Manager is responsible for informing the participant of their freedom of choice of providers during this meeting (and more frequently as needed, should a situation arise mid-cycle during the Plan of Care year which requires consideration of a provider change). The Case Manager has the responsibility of ensuring that this information drives the development of the Plan of Care. A standardized person- centered planning format is used throughout the Plan of Care development process. The Plan of Care is developed by the Team, which includes the participant, their family/legal representatives (as appropriate), t he Case Manager and others invited by the participant. These Team members know and work with the participant and their active involvement is necessary to achieve the outcomes desired by the participant. DC Code Title 2- Section 137 describes the requirements for Plan of Care development. T he Plan of Care process assures that participants have access to quality services and supports that foster independence, learning and growth; choices in everyday life; meaningful relationships with family, friends and neighbors, presence and participation in the fabric of community life; dignity and respect; positive approaches aimed at skill development; and health and safety. The Plan of Care process is driven by the participant's vision, goals and n eeds with overall management and facilitation provided by the Case Manager. The District's procedures to address the terms and conditions of the Plan of Care section of the waiver application are as follows: a. SERVICE PLAN DEVELOPMENT AND TIMING Upon being determined eligible for waiver services, the participant's assigned Case Manager explains all available services in the Waiver during the initial contact so that the participant and their family/legal representatives can make informed choices. The participant is also informed of all procedural safeguards, their rights and responsibilities, how to request a change of providers, and the District's grievance and complaint procedures. This initial Case Manager contact with the participant occurs within 30 days of being determined eligible. The Plan of Care is developed through a collaborative support team process involving the participant, family, friends or other support systems, legal representatives, the Case Manager, appropriate professionals/service providers, and o thers who the participant chooses to be involved. The Plan must be completed within 30 calendar days of the participant's date of eligibility. The Case Manager facilitates the Plan of Care meeting. The Case Manager is ultimately responsible for the development and monitoring of the Plan of Care. Following completion of the annual Plan of Care meeting and no later than 30 days following the meeting, the DDS Case Manager Supervisor reviews and approves the Plan of Care. The Supervisor is responsible for ensuring that the waiver services are clearly delineated and justified, based upon the needs identified in the Plan of Care and its a ccompanying assessments. The Plan of Care is implemented within 30 days of the Plan of Care meeting. Annually, the entire team meets to review and revise the Plan for the upcoming service year. The annual date of the Page 107 of 169 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov 20, 2007 10/25/2007 https://www.hcbswaivers.net/CMS/faces/protected/print/PrintSelector.jspPlan of Care does not change, even if there has been a recent meeting to revise the Plan. b . ASSESSMENTS Personal interviews are conducted with each participant during the Plan of Care development process. For new enrollees in the waiver, the assessments completed as part of the intake and eligibility process are utilized for the initial planning process. These include psychological evaluations, medical evaluations, and a social history. The initial assessment processes also use standardized assessment tools, including the Health Care Forms 1-3 and a Health Risk Screening Tool, to assist in predicting the Medicaid waiver program's ability to assure the participant's health and safety. Beginning in January 2008, new enrollees will also have the Support Intensity Scale (SIS) and a Risk Screening Tool completed as part of the initial planning process. Additional information for the assessment process is collected by the Case Manager and includes the following information: 1. The personal outcomes envisioned, defined and prioritized by the participant; 2. Medical/physical information and documentation; psycho- social/behavioral 3. Developmental/intellectual information and documentation; 4. Socialization/recreational information and documentation, including relationships that are important to the participant and the social environment of the participant; 5. Patterns of the participant's everyday life; 6. Identification of informal supports available to the participant; 7. Information and documentation on financial resources; 8. Educational/vocational information and documentation; 9. Information on the current status of housing and the physical environment; 10. Information about previously successful and unsuccessful strategies to achieve the participant's desired personal outcomes; 11. Safeguards for protection from harm; and 12. Any other information relevant to understanding the supports and services needed by the participant to achieve the desired personal outcomes. A reassessment may be conducted at any time, particularly with a significant change in the participant's status. The assessment process is ongoing, and designed to reflect changes in the participant's life, individual needs, and changing personal outcomes, including strengths, needs, preferences, abilities and resources. At each annual planning meeting thereafter, the Case Manager and team members will review all available assessments and support plans in place in preparation for the annual planning process. This will include a review of the completed SIS and the additional risk screening elements. c. HOW PARTICIPANTS ARE INFORMED OF AVAILABLE SERVICES Participants and their legal representatives are informed of available waiver services during the initial contact with the Case Manager. Participants are then made aware of waiver services available during the Plan of Care development process, and more frequently as needed should circumstances arise that prompt an interest in changing providers. d. INCORPORATION OF PARTICIPANT GOALS/NEEDS/PREFERENCES IN PLAN The Plan of Care must incorporate the following required components: 1. The participant' s prioritized personal outcomes, and specific strategies to achieve or maintain the desired personal outcomes, focusing first on informal and community supports and, if needed, paid formal services; 2 . An action plan which will lead to the implementation of strategies to achieve the desired personal outcomes, including action steps, review dates and individuals who will be responsible for specific steps, ensuring that the steps which are incorporated empower and help the participant to develop independence, growth, and self-management; 3. Target dates for the achievement/maintenance of personal outcomes; 4 . Identification of the preferred formal and informal service providers and specification of the service arrangements; 5. Identification of individuals who will assist the Case Manager in planning, building/implementing supports, or direct services; and 6. Signatures on the Plan of Care from the participant and all Team members present indicating their agreement with the Plan of Care. I t is the requirement of this information and its inclusion in the Plan of Care that ensures the participant's goals, needs, including health care needs and preferences are addressed. Page 108 of 169 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov 20, 2007 10/25/2007 https://www.hcbswaivers.net/CMS/faces/protected/print/PrintSelector.jspAppendix D: Participant-Centered Planning and Service Delivery D -1: Service Plan Development (5 of 8) e. Risk Assessment and Mitigation. S pecify how potential risks to the participant are assessed during the service plan development process and how strategies to mitigate risk are incorporated into the service plan, subject to participant needs and preferences. In addition, describe how the service plan development process addresses backup plans and the arrangements that are used for backup. d. COORDINATION OF WAIVER SERVICES Waiver and other identified services on the Plan of Care are coordinated through the Case Manager. Case Managers are required to make monthly contact with each participant, and make a face-to-face visit with the participant on a monthly basis. During eight of these monthly contacts, Case Managers review information on the Plan of Care, track progress on identified goals and time lines, and get updated information on the progress of informal/unpaid supports i dentified in the Plan of Care; a Case Management Visit Monitoring Tool is completed at each of these eight meetings. Information from the Tool is entered into the DDS MCIS system and is reviewed by the Case Manager Supervisor. Any concerns are addressed by the Supervisor. The participant and their legal representatives may contact the Case Manager at any time for assistance. Formal monthly contacts offer an opportunity for the participant to request a Team meeting to make formal revisions to the Plan of Care, and for the Case Manager to request a reassessment or a new assessment. e. ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES TO IMPLEMENT AND MONITOR PLAN Each goal identified on the Plan of Care has a time frame for accomplishment. The Case Manager is responsible for monitoring the progress of goals to ensure that they are completed or revisions are made as necessary when identified goals change, or cannot be accomplished within the identified time frames. During the development of the Plan of Care, team members volunteer or are asked to take on roles and responsibilities to facilitate linkage of the participant to the identified services and supports that are outside of the Medicaid-funded services. During monthly contacts with the participant and their legal representatives, the Case Manager receives information on the progress of these assignments and their success in assisting the participant to have a high quality of life. Every six months, or more frequently as needed, the Case Manager, the participant, the service provider(s) and others the participant chooses to be present, review the Plan of Care to determine if the goals identified on the Plan are being achieved, the participant's needs, including health and safety are being addressed, and to make any adjustments or changes necessary to the Plan. g. HOW AND WHEN PLAN IS UPDATED The Plan of Care must be revised annually or as necessary to meet the needs of the participant. The Case Manager is tasked with arranging for any needed assessments and contacting the participant to arrange for the scheduling and location of the meeting. The Case Manager also contacts the participant's service providers to inform them of the meeting. The Plan of Care meeting is always completed before the anniversary date of the current Plan of Care. The Case Manager is solely responsible for ensuring that the Plan of Care is conducted in accordance with DDS r equirements and is consistent with best practice in the field of developmental disabilities. Mid-Plan of Care cycle changes that require Plan of Care revisions are coordinated by the case manager. Documentation for the Plan of Care revision is completed by the case manager and submitted to the Case Manager Supervisor for review and approval. The Supervisor has two business days to review and approve the Plan of Care or return it to the case manager for additional information. DDS will be implementing a risk assessment process that will conform to CMS requirements. DDS is completing t he SIS on all participants during waiver year one. Additionally, all participants are evaluated by DDS to determine if a comprehensive health care assessment will be completed by a DDS nurse as a result of the initial screening. If a health care assessment is completed, a health care plan is prepared for the participant that addresses all health care needs and risks. The following is the description of this process: The Plan of Care Team, as part of their preparation for the Plan of Care meeting, completes an assessment that Page 109 of 169 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov 20, 2007 10/25/2007 https://www.hcbswaivers.net/CMS/faces/protected/print/PrintSelector.jspAppendix D: Participant-Centered Planning and Service Delivery D -1: Service Plan Development (6 of 8) f. Informed Choice of Providers. D escribe how participants are assisted in obtaining information about and selecting from among qualified providers of the waiver services in the service plan. identifies potential areas in which the participant's safety is at risk, including physical, emotional, medical, financial and legal risks, as well as risks to community participation; the frequency and degree of potential harm to the participant and/or others; and why, when, where and how the risk to safety may occur. This includes identification of the participant's understanding of the risk and their skills at addressing the risk. The assessment process includes interviews with the participant and their legal representatives. The Case Manager conducts a review of any critical incidents during the preceding year. During the planning process, team members discuss possible strategies to mitigate potential risks that have been identified. Development of strategies to mitigate risks shall take into account the needs and preferences of the participant. The approach that will be utilized to mitigate each specific risk may be incorporated into the Plan of Care. The emergency back-up plan is a core component of the Plan of Care format and is completed at the time of the planning meeting. All enrolled providers of waiver services must possess the capacity to provide the support and services required by the participant in order to insure the participant's health and safety as determined by the Team and detailed in the Plan of Care. When paid supports are scheduled to be provided by an enrolled provider of waiver services, that provider is responsible for providing all necessary staff to fulfill the health and safety needs of the participant, including times when scheduled direct support staff is absent, unavailable or unable to work for any reason. The identified enrolled provider of waiver services cannot use the participant's informal support system as a means of meeting the participant's back-up plan unless the participant, with assistance from their team, has agreed to do so. This agreement must be documented in the Plan of Care. The Case Manager assists the participant and the team members to identify individuals who are willing and able to provide a back-up system during times when paid supports are not scheduled on the participant's Plan of Care. Back-up plans are updated no less than annually through the Plan of Care process to assure information is kept current and applicable to the participant's needs at all times. The identified enrolled provider of waiver services must have in place policies and procedures that outline the protocols the agency has established to assure that back-up direct support staff are readily available, lines of communication and chain-of-command have been established, and procedures are in place for dissemination of the back-up plan information to participants, their legal representatives, and Case Manager. Protocols outlining how and when the direct support staff are to be trained in the care and supports needed by the participant must also be included. This training must occur prior to any direct service worker being solely responsible for the support of the participant. The participant and their legal representatives are informed of the services available under the waiver during the C ase Manager's initial contact with the participant. Part of this contact involves a discussion of Freedom of Choice of qualified waiver providers and the availability of services. The Case Manager and the participant and their legal representatives also discuss the role of the Case Manager and determine the supports the participant requires from Case Management. The Case Manager provides the participant with a list of all qualified Medicaid providers and the specific waiver services they offer. The participant and their legal representative are encouraged by the Case Manager to interview or visit each provider agency they are interested in, in order to make informed choices. The Case Manager is available to assist the participant in contacting and interviewing potential providers. The Case Manager also has the responsibility of assisting the participant when they wish to change providers.

Monitoring Safeguards. S elect one: The State has established the following safeguards to ensure that monitoring is conducted in the best interests of the participant. Specify: Appendix E: Participant Direction of Services A pplicability (f rom Application Section 3, Components of the Waiver Request) : Yes. This waiver provides participant direction opportunities. Complete the remainder of the Appendix. No. This waiver does not provide participant direction opportunities. Do not complete the remainder of the The Case Manager is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Plan of Care and the effectiveness of the Plan in meeting the participant's needs, preferences, and health and welfare. The Case Manager assesses the effectiveness of the Plan of Care eight times per year and more frequently as needed through contact with the participant as well as a review of documentation submitted by providers related to Plan implementation and progress. Monthly face-to-face meetings between the participant and the Case Manager provide an in-depth opportunity for the Case Manager to assess the participant's well- being and the effectiveness of the services provided through the Plan of Care. During these contacts the Case Manager checks to make sure that: 1 . There is access to waiver and non-waiver services identified in the Plan, including access to health services; 2. The strategies to meet the participant's personal goals are being implemented and the effectiveness of the strategies; 3. The services outlined on the Plan are meeting the needs of the participant; 4. The participant is satisfied with the service providers they have chosen; 5. Services are being furnished in accordance with the Plan; 6. The participant's health and welfare needs are being met; and 7. Back-up plans, if utilized, are effective and persons identified as responsible for back-up plans are still active in the participant's life. If at any time the Case Manager believes the participant is at risk, the Case Manager is charged with taking all immediate steps necessary to protect the participant. If the Case Manager determines that services are not effectively addressing the needs or preferences of the participant, the Case Manager is charged with convening the Team to make necessary revisions to the Plan of Care. If it is determined that the provider is not implementing the Plan of Care as required or does not meet contractual responsibilities or DDS policies, the Case Manager consults with the provider to secure a commitment from the provider for the necessary change. If the service deficiency is not resolved within the agreed time, the Case Manager informs the Case Manager Supervisor who in turn intervenes with the provider. Continued lack of c ompliance results in an administrative inquiry by DDS, which may lead to sanctions including but not limited to termination of the agreement to serve the participant. When a Case Manager or DDS Program Integrity Unit monitoring staff completes a review of any kind, any problematic results are entered into the online MCIS Alert tracking system. This system is a data base used to communicate, manage and monitor for closure any significant issue that is identified by any DDS staff person. The DDS MCIS' s Alert System provides a way for any interested party to ask a question about service provision that will be tracked to resolution. A more detailed summary of data collection, analysis and reporting is prepared for MAA by the Program Integrity Unit and submitted as part of the quarterly reports. The Case Manager completes a Case M anager Monitoring Tool at each visit and submits that document to the program Integrity Unit as well. The Program Integrity Unit monitors this information and prepares quarterly summary reports for DDS management and MAA review. Case Manager Supervisors and the Program Integrity Unit monitor the Alert system for significant individual concerns for additional support and assurance follow -up. Entities and/or individuals that have responsibility to monitor service plan implementation and p articipant health and welfare may not provide other direct waiver services to the participant.n mlkj i Entities and/or individuals that have responsibility to monitor service plan implementation and participant health and welfare may provide other direct waiver services to the participantn mlkj n mlkj n mlkj Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov 20, 2007 10/25/2007 https://www.hcbswaivers.net/CMS/faces/protected/print/PrintSelector.jspAppendix.

Appen dix F: Participant Rights Appen dix F-1: Opportunity to Request a Fair Hearing The State provides an opportunity to request a Fair H earing under 42 CFR Part 431, Subpart E to individuals: (a) who are not given the choice of home and community-based services as an alternative to the institutional care specified in Item 1-F of the request; (b) are denied the service(s) of their choice or the provider(s) of their choice; or, (c) whose services are denied, suspended, reduced or terminated. The State provides notice of action as required in 42 CFR \u00a7431.210. Procedures for Offering Opportunity to Request a Fair Hearing. Describe how the individual (or his/her legal representative) is informed of the opportunity to request a fair hearing under 42 CFR Part 431, Subpart E. Specify the notice (s) that are used to offer individuals the opportunity to request a Fair Hearing. State laws, regulations, policies and notices referenced in the description are available to CMS upon request through the operating or Medicaid agency. Any individual seeking DDS HCBS Medicaid Waiver services is offered opportunities to request a fair hearing. Should a participant be denied a service, be notified of a reduction in service, or an applicant be denied admittance to the DDS Waiver, they have the right to request a fair hearing. Notice of these actions are prepared and mailed to the participant and legal representative by DDS. Included is a copy of the notice of the Fair Hearing Rights, how to request a hearing through DOH and where to obtain assistance if needed. The DDS Intake Unit provides the official introduction to waiver resources. This introduction also includes information on the right to a fair hearing, and information on how to request a fair hearing. Applicants interested in the DDS waiver receive a DDS waiver brochure, DDS provider directory and instructions on how to access the DDS waiver Program. At that time, i nformation regarding the fair hearing process is also provided, including grounds for appeal such as denial of a service and disputes that are not reconciled through dialogue with the DDS waiver provider or with DDS. In accordance with the District municipal regulations, the DOH Office on Administrative Hearings ultimately grants participants and/ or providers the opportunity to receive a fair hearing based on a request. Each participant is given the opportunity to request a fair hearing in writing and is given information on the location to send the fair hearing request. The notices must be made to a participant for any denial of or reduction in services.

Operational Responsibility. Specify the State agency that is responsible for the operation of the grievance/complaint system: to freedom of choice and selected by the participant. The District maintains no responsibility for the participant's choice; as clarified in the Beneficiary Freedom of Choice form signed by each potential service recipient. When an applicant is informed of his ineligibility for Medicaid and thus the HCBS (DDS) Waiver, the Income Maintenance Administration sends a denial letter to the applicant. The Case Manager contacts the applicant and discusses the reasons for the denial with the potential service recipient. If the applicant is denied a Level of Care by the DDS Waiver Unit, a denial letter that includes the information on how to access the fair hearing process is sent to the applicant by DDS. When an agency seeks to discontinue services to a participant, the participant must be given 30 days written notice by the agency. The case manager is also responsible for assisting the participant in pursuing alternative service providers and any other necessary actions to assure participant health and welfare. A participant who appeals a service decision is informed that services will continue during the period while the participant' s appeal is under consideration. If the applicant is not eligible for Medicaid, services will not have started. If a participant is n otified of a service termination or suspension, the provider agency continues services while the appeal is processed and until the outcome of the hearing. If needed, alternative arrangements are made for continuation of services. Notification will be made to the participant by the provider agency. All notices of fair hearings and requests are maintained in the District's Office of Fair Hearings and the Office of the Attorney General for the Medical Assistance Administration (MAA). An Appellants' Bill of Rights and Request for a Hearing Case form is available for review at the Medical Assistance Administration. n mlkj i n mlkj n mlkj n mlkj i Two agencies are responsible for operation of the gr i evance/complaint system: Page 116 of 169 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov 20, 2007 10/25/2007 of System.

Appeals of Provider Human Rights Committee decisions and/or a grievance against a Provider Human Rights Committee; and 4. Nursing Home placements or placements to more restrictive settings. Finally, the Committee reviews all pertinent data and analysis and makes appropriate recommendations regarding human rights. DDS maintains a process for addressing all DDS Waiver related complaints. The participant is informed that filing a grievance or complaint is not a prerequisite or substitute for a fair hearing. The participant has the right to utilize the complaints process by writing a letter to the DDS Director, requesting a Fair Hearing through MAA or taking additional action through litigation. The participant is not bound by the DDS or MAA complaint process from taking legal action at any time. The DDS Human Rights Office coordinates the DDS complaint process. A complainant n eed not go through the grievance process prior to requesting a fair hearing. The grievance process is handled on two levels, verbally and in writing. Complaints, both verbal and written, are received by the DDS Human Rights Office and or may be reported directly to MAA. Each complaint or grievance receives personal attention, as warranted. The DOH Health Regulation Administration receives copies of all provider-related complaints tied to licensed facilities from DDS and MAA and takes action, as needed. For non- licensed facilities, the DDS Office of Incident Management and Enforcement manages all complaints. Procedures are as follows: 1. The following information is collected at the time a complaint is received: - Complainant information (name, address, telephone number, etc.); - Individuals involved and affected, witness, and accusers; - Allegation categories (abuse, neglect, lack of or inconsistency in the provision of services, failure to provide appropriate care or medical intervention, etc); - Narrative/specifics of allegation/incident; - If the complainant believes that this is an isolated event or a systematic problem and why and how the complainant believes the incident occurred; - Date and time of allegation; - Date/time/frequency of incidence occurrence; - Location of the incident; - Courses of action initiated; and - Complainant's expectation/desire for resolution, if any. 2. DDS reviews collected data and investigates allegations. In the instance of a provider-related complaint, DDS requests a written account from the provider within 14 calendar days of notice. Information included in the account should be the occurrence, list of involved participants, any witnesses, physical injuries (as indicated), hospital injuries (as indicated), challenges identified and resolution of identified challenges. The provider must also identify deficiencies and a corrective action plan. Participants are informed of the corrective action plans and their right to Fair Hearing, if wanted. The following District laws govern these policies and procedures: D.C. Municipal Regulation (DCMR) Incidents and Complaints Chapter 42, Title 29; and Home Care Agencies Complaint Process, Chapter 39, Title 22. DDS will prepare rules for the DDS Waiver prior to the requested start date of this waiver. Page 117 of 169 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov Participant Safeguards Appen dix G-1: Response to Critical Events or Incidents a. State Critical Event or Incident Reporting Require m ents. Specify the types of critical events or incidents (including alleged abuse, neglect and exploitation) that the State requires to be reported for review and follow-up action by an appropriate authority, the individuals and/or entities that are required to report such events and incidents and the timelines for reporting. State laws, regulations, and policies that are referenced are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable). On admission to the DDS Waiver program, the DDS Bill of Rights and Responsibilities Form (Revised) is given to participants. The form addresses the ability of participants to file complaints and assures that no reprisal shall occur by any party if a complaint is filed. The form signed by the participant reflects language that clearly states that the participant shall not be penalized or suffer any reprisals as a result of filing a grievance. The District of Columbia uses a three-level approach to reporting and investigating incidents involving participants s erved by DDS. Level 1 includes serious reportable incidents involving death, abuse, neglect, theft of the consumer's personal property, or serious physical injury. Level 2 includes serious reportable incidents involving serious medication error, improper use of restraints, emergency inpatient hospitalization, suicide attempt or threat, missing person, or 911 calls for law enforcement personnel, emergency medical assistance or fire. Level 3 includes all other reportable incidents (not included in Levels 1 or 2) that are not considered serious or significant enough to require an independent investigation by the DDS, such as when a participant is taken to the hospital by the provider staff for a physical injury or a cut or abrasion not requiring stitches, an automobile accident or an accidental detachment of a toe nail. The policy and operating procedures, which include extensive definitions for each incident type and the reporting requirements, are set forth in MRDDA Policy No. 6.2 dated September 30, 2006, and the Operational Procedures for the Office of Investigations and Compliance, which is now known as the Incident Management and Enforcement U nit (IMEU). According to the incident management policy, employees, sub-contractors, consultants, volunteers or interns of a provider or governmental agency are required to make an oral report immediately when a serious reportable incident (i.e. Level 1 and 2) or reportable incident (i.e. Level 3) is witnessed, discovered or becomes known. For Level 1 and 2 serious reportable incidents, this is accomplished by calling during office hours the District of Columbia 24 hour response system called \"Answers Please\" by dialing INFO 211. After business hours the verbal notification is made through the DDS Duty Officer on-call system. Reportable incidents (Level 3) must be recorded on the DDS Incident Report form, maintained by the provider for monthly tracking and trending, and, submitted to DDS, the Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities, Inc. (Quality Trust), the Department of Health's Health Regulation Administration (HRA) and Medical Assistance Administration (MAA), and the Evans Court Monitor upon request. In the event of a Serious Reportable Incidents (Level 1 and 2), the provider is required to document the incident in the DDS Consumer Information System (MCIS) within 24 hours of the incident. Also, providers are required to submit a written report to DDS, the Quality Trust, and the Evans Court Monitor, as well as forward a copy to the District's Office of the Inspector General (OIG), HRA, and MAA, as applicable. The reportable incidents (i.e. Level 3) are reported on the DDS Incident Report form and in MCIS, but the provider alone is required to conduct an internal investigation within five business days and report to the DDS case manager assigned to the participant. Allegations of abuse or neglect for individuals over the age of 18 are also reported immediately upon identification to the Department of Human Services' Adult Protective Services unit, and for children under the age of 18 to the Child and Family Services Agency's Child Protective Services unit. Deaths are investigated by a third-party contractor on behalf of DDS. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), the MRDD Fatality Review Committee, and the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) are also included in the distribution of the initial report and the final investigative report, in addition to the other agencies identified for serious reportable incidents. Incident data is entered into the MCIS system, aggregated by the Program Integrity Unit and monitored/analyzed for trends. MAA also has direct access to the MCIS system to monitor Incident activity. The Program Integrity Unit Page 118 of 169 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov 20, 2007 10/25/2007 https://www.hcbswaivers.net/CMS/faces/protected/print/PrintSelector.jspb. Participant Training and Education. D escribe how training and/or information is provided to participants (and/or families or legal representatives, as appropriate) concerning protections from abuse, neglect, and exploitation, including how participants (and/or families or legal representatives, as appropriate) can notify appropriate authorities or entities when the participant may have experienced abuse, neglect or exploitation. c. Responsibility for Review of and Response to Critical Events or Incidents. Specify the entity (or entities) that receives reports of critical events or incidents specified in item G-1-a, the methods that are employed to evaluate such reports, and the processes and time-frames for responding to critical events or incidents, including conducting investigations. prepares quarterly reports for MAA on incident management data and analysis as part of a larger quality reporting process to MAA. MAA will have access to the MCIS system effective November 1, 2007 to view all incidents as needed. DDS also provides summary monthly and quarterly reports to MAA. DDS has agreed to provide this information to MAA on a routine basis. MRDD Waiver providers are required to file reports on Level 1 & 2 incidents within 24 hours. The provider must report an incident if the incident occurs during the delivery of its services. The case manager or DDA quality enhancement staff may enter incidents if observed by a DDA staff person or reported to DDA by a person or entity without access to MCISMAA may view all incidents through the MCIS. For deaths that are investigated, initial reports from the Columbus Organization are due within 35 days and the final report within 45 days. Participants and their families receive a Fact Sheet regarding protections afforded participants, how abuse, neglect, m istreatment and exploitation is defined, and how to report such incidents upon intake and at the annual planning meetings by the DDS Case Manager. Provider agencies are also required to train and educate participants regarding abuse, neglect, mistreatment and exploitation on an annual basis, and as part of enhanced quality expectations are expected to use naturally occurring opportunities throughout the year to reinforce the learning process. The methods to report those activities are part of the new Basic Assurance Standards review expectations for District providers. An IMEU Compliance Specialist ensures that all incidents submitted by providers in the MCIS are adequately c ompleted within one business day. The Compliance Specialist contacts the provider or other reporter to ensure that all notifications to other government entities have been made (i.e. MPD, OCME, HRA, MAA, OIG, Adult Protective Services, Child Protective Services). The Compliance Specialist also verifies for all Level 1 incidents involving a llegations of abuse, neglect or theft that the staff alleged to be involved in the incident have been removed from contact with DDS participants. Other serious reportable incidents and reportable incidents are triaged for follow-up investigation by the provider and/or IMEU, depending on whether the allegations are properly categorized as Level 1, 2 or 3. Level 1 (i.e. death, allegation of abuse, allegation of neglect, theft of personal property, and serious physical injuries) and Level 2 (i.e. serious medication error, improper use of restraints, emergency inpatient hospitalization, suicide attempt or threat, missing person, or 911 calls for law enforcement personnel, emergency medical assistance or fire) serious reportable incidents require the provider to conduct an internal investigation within five business days of the incident, and IMEU is required to conduct its investigation and prepare its investigative report within 45 calendar days. During its investigation, the IMEU assesses the provider's internal investigation. To the extent that the provider's internal i nvestigation and recommended remedial measures are deemed sufficient for Level 2 serious reportable incidents, the IMEU investigator may seek permission from the IMEU Chief for an administrative closure of the case. For all Level 1 serious reportable incidents, and for all Level 2 serious reportable incidents for which an IMEU investigative report is prepared, an IMEU Compliance Specialist is assigned to monitor the provider's compliance with the r ecommended remedial measures. Level 3 reportable incidents are investigated by the provider alone and are reviewed periodically by the IMEU's Compliance Specialists for compliance with recommended remedial measures. These reviews by Compliance Specialists include evaluation of recommended follow-up activities and the DDS investigator reconciles any questions or concerns. The IMEU submits its investigative report for serious reportable incidents to the provider, Quality Trust, OIG, HRA, MAA, the participant's legal guardian, Case Manager and the Evans Court Monitor and Evans parties, as applicable, w ithin seven days. The reportable incidents (i.e. Level 3) are reported on the DDS Incident Report form and in MCIS, but the provider alone is required to conduct an internal investigation within five business days and report to Page 119 of 169 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov 20, 2007 10/25/2007 https://www.hcbswaivers.net/CMS/faces/protected/print/PrintSelector.jspd. Responsibility for Oversight of Critical Incidents and Events. I dentify the State agency (or agencies) responsible for overseeing the reporting of and response to critical incidents or events that affect waiver participants, how this oversight is conducted, and how frequently. Appendix G: Participant Safeguards t he DDS Case Manager for the participantr. The Case Manager or the provider may report the outcome of the investigation to the participant. DDS is creating a new Internal Rights, Protection and Advocacy Unit that will recommend to the Director best practices to follow in this area for implementation. Allegations of abuse or neglect for individuals over the age of 18 are also reported immediately upon identification to the Department of Human Services' Adult Protective Services, and for children under the age of 18 to Child and Family Services Agency's Child Protective Services. In addition, deaths are investigated by a third-party contractor within 45 days on behalf of DDS and the OCME, DDS Fatality Review Committee, and MPD are included in the distribution of the MCIS reporting and the final investigative report. Follow-up recommendations that result from an investigation are to be initiated or implemented within five business days of receipt of the IMEU investigative report and are verified by the IMEU Compliance Officer. Any recommendations not addressed and completed by the provider after receiving follow-up and support from the IMEU Compliance Specialist are referred to the Program Integrity Division to determine if technical assistance is required, if monitoring needs to be instituted, and, if needed, the type of sanctions and or enforcement remedies that should be recommended. The Program Integrity Division reviews and prepares cases for submission to the newly created Compliance Coordinating Council where the member agencies (i.e. DDS, MAA, HRA and Department of Mental Health) can determine appropriate penalties and/or sanctions to impose to obtain compliance. MAA must be in attendance at these meetings as part of the MAA oversight responsibilities for the operation of the HCBS waiver. T imeframes for reporting can be changed or adjusted when there are health and safety concerns. For similarly situated individuals the IMEU conducts an immediate and accelerated investigation. Additionally, if the Columbus Organization during the 45 day period identifies potential concerns, DDA is notified and DDA initiates a mortality review meeting with the preliminary findings and concerns with the provider and medical professionals as appropriate to enact immediate remediation if indicated. Timeframes for informing the participant and other relevant parties of the investigation results are done within 1 business day of completion of results which are then faxed and mailed. 3) The PI Division reviews and prepares cases for submission to the newly created Compliance Coordinating Council (CCC) where the member agencies (i.e., DDS, MAA, HRA and DMH) can determine appropriate penalties and/or sanctions to impose to obtain compliance. MAA oversees this process through the following: MAA is on the Council and reviews data, protocols and processes and collectively works with DDS, Department of Health -Health Regulation Administration (HRA) and the Department of Mental Health (DMH) to strategize ways to address non -compliance. On a monthly basis, the DDS Quality Enhancement's Quality Improvement office (QI) conducts an overview a nalysis of data collected as part of the incident investigative process. On a quarterly basis, the QI, completes a review that evaluates and investigates trends of incidents, and develops and assures the implementation of corrective action plans to address identified trends and underlying concerns. Quarterly reports of incident reporting and findings from investigations are prepared by the Quality Enhancement Unit for dissemination and review by the Quality Improvement Committee, which includes external stakeholders such as family members, DOH/HRA , the Quality Trust and internal members including Case Management, IMEU, and others. Monthly statistics are submitted to MAA. DDA additionally submits analysis of incidents by type and provider to MAA on a quarterly basis. Data is reviewed by the DDA Quality Improvement Committee that makes recommendations to the DDS Deputy Director for DDA for provider or systemic follow-up. MAA receives the QI Committee report and following review may request written or verbal reports from DDA. The District indicates that quarterly reports of incident reporting and findings from investigations are prepared by the Quality Enhancement Unit for dissemination and review by the Quality Improvement Committee\u2014 MAA receives a copy of the DDS quarterly reports. This exchange of information agreement is also spelled out in the revised MRDD Waiver MOU.

Use of Restraints or Seclusion. (S elect one) : The State does not permit or prohibits the use of restraints or seclusion Specify the State agency (or agencies) responsible for detecting the unauthorized use of restraints or seclusion and how this oversight is conducted and its frequency: The use of restraints or seclusion is permitted during the course of the delivery of waiver services . Complete Items G-2-a-i and G-2-a-ii. i. Safeguards Concerning the Use of Restraints or Seclusion. Specify the safeguards that the State has established concerning the use of each type of restraint (i.e., personal restraints, drugs used as restraints, mechanical restraints or seclusion). State laws, regulations, and policies that are referenced are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable). ii. State Oversight Responsibility. Specify the State agency (or agencies) responsible for overseeing the use of restraints or seclusion and ensuring that State safeguards concerning their use are followed and how such oversight is conducted and its frequency: n mlkj n mlkj i T he District use of restraints is only permitted unde r authorized conditions and as sparingly as possible. DDA monitors the use of restraints by comparing reports of restraint against a log of approved restraint programs to ensure the use of restraint has been authorized. Use of three emergency restraints in a 30 day period triggers the requirement to initiate behavior support modifications to consider the use of planned restraint by the team. During Quality Enhancement monitoring, case management monitoring and Basic Assurance reviews DDA team members review records and interview staff and participants The District indicates that information from the Incident Management system and the Case Manager M onitoring tools is aggregated, analyzed and reported to the MAA on a quarterly basis for its oversight. What does MAA do with the information in order to prevent re-occurrence? The District has recently improved its communication between DDA and MAA on Incident Management. The District uses Case Manager Monitoring tools and will use quarterly reports to convey this information to MAA. MAA has requested this information as part of its oversight. As of August 2 007 and going forward DDS will provide IMEU summary and detailed data to MAA. MAA has asked for both quarterly summary reports of aggregated IMEU and Case Manager data and also summary details. As part of its oversight roles, after MAA review any issues that are raised are formally presented for DDS response. Any issues raised by MAA- ODA staff that do not have resolution are noted and DDS is asked to review for completeness and resolution and remedial action taken including development of r emediation plan to ensure future compliance. Any patterns of non-compliance are noted in writing and escalated to Senior officials at both MAA and DDS. Provider HRC reviews restrictive controls. DDS Human Rights Committee (HRC) reviews all recommendations for placement into a Long Term Care (LTC) setting, reviews meeting minutes of Provider HRC meetings as a monitoring tool, and reviews specific restrictive control plans as requested by the team or as a sampling process for quality improvement. Per policy, restrictive controls may only be approved if less restrictive interventions have been employed and failed. Such evidence must be documented and presented to the Restricted Controls Review Committee. Once a restrictive control is approved the use of escalating interventions is detailed in the behavior support plan and documented per the approved BSP. MAA has delegated to DDS this assurance and has relied on DDS to provide documentation of the Behavior Review Committee (RCRC). This has largely been work done by Case Managers. Going forward MAA will receive quarterly RCRC reports and will review and comment upon report and Page 121 of 169 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov Participant Safeguards Appen dix G-2: Safeguards Concerning Restraints and Restrictive Interventions (2 of 2) b.

Safeguards Concerning the Use of Restrictive Interventions. Specify the safeguards that the State has in effect concerning the use of interventions that restrict participant movement, participant access to other individuals, locations or activities, restrict participant rights or employ aversive methods (not including r estraints or seclusion) to modify behavior. State laws, regulations, and policies referenced in the specification are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency. ii. State Oversight Responsibility. Specify the State agency (or agencies) responsible for monitoring and overseeing the use of restrictive interventions and how this oversight is conducted and its frequency: convey that information back to DDS. n mlkj n mlkj i T he District does not permit seclusion and only allow s the use of authorized restraint sparingly. The District DDA provides the following safeguards: DDA compares reports of restraint against a log of approved restraint programs to ensure the use of restraint has been authorized. Use of three emergency restraints in a 30 day period triggers the requirement to initiate behavior support modifications to consider the use of planned restraint by the team. During Quality Enhancement monitoring, case management monitoring and Basic Assurance reviews DDA team members review records and interview staff and participants. The District MAA and DDS-DDA have improved their communication and MAA has relied upon DDA t o provide assurances that DDS is meeting requirements. Going forward MAA will monitor aggregated data and reoports that provide analysis of restrictive interventions. MAA will review these reports quarterly. Upon review and analysis MAA requests that DDS provide remediation plan with clear action steps designed to prevent re-occurrence. DDS will provide IMEU summary and detailed data to MAA. MAA has asked for both quarterly summary reports of aggregated IMEU and Case Manager data and also summary details. As part of its oversight roles, after MAA review any issues raised are formally presented for DDS response. Any issues raised by MAA-ODA staff that do not have resolution are noted and DDS is asked to review for completeness and resolution and remedial action taken including development of remediation plan to ensure future compliance. Any patterns of non-compliance are noted in writing and escalated to Senior officials at both MAA and DDS. The following practices are prohibited per the Restrictive Control Procedures/Behavior Support Policy: A ny prohibition of contact with a guardian, family, attorney, probation officer, regulatory or advocacy personnel, or religious representative; any procedure or action which is degrading, humiliating, harsh, or abusive; any form of corporal punishment or systemic aversive conditioning; subjection to unclean, u nsafe and/or unsanitary living conditions; the use of seclusion or secured time out rooms; the use of mechanical restraints, as defined in the policy; the PRN use of psychotropic medications, and all forms of chemical restraint as defined by this policy; deprivation of opportunities for bathing, toilet use, or Page 122 of 169 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov Participant Safeguards Appen dix G-3: Medication Management and Administration (1 of 2) This Appendix must be completed when waiver services are furnished to participants who are served in licensed or unlicensed living arrangements where a provider has round-the-clock responsibility for the health and welfare of residents.

The Incident Management and Enforcement Unit (IMEU) reviews all incident reports. Any emergency use of a restrictive procedure or instance of abuse, neglect or mistreatment is immediately investigated by DDS's IMEU to assure that appropriate positive behavioral supports or approved restrictive controls are in place if needed. Such incidents are closely tracked and monitored for any repeated trends. Also, the Office of Program Integrity monitors programs to ensure that quality standards and systems are in place and reports any instances of inappropriate or unapproved behavior support, abuse, neglect or mistreatment they observe to the RCRC or HRAC as appropriate. Similarly, Case Managers, nurses and licensing agencies report on the same issues they may encounter to the RCRC or HRAC as appropriate. T he DDS Human Rights Committee reviews documentation of cases and policies used by providers. The HRC reviews restrictive controls for Providers. DDS HRC reviews all recommendations for placement into a Long Term Care (LTC) setting, reviews meeting minutes of Provider HRC meetings as a monitoring tool, and reviews specific restrictive control plans as requested by the team or as a s ampling process for quality improvement. Per policy, restrictive controls may only be approved if less restrictive interventions have been employed and failed. Such evidence must be documented and presented to the Restricted Controls Review Committee. Once a restrictive control is approved the use of escalating interventions is detailed in the behavior support plan and documented per the approved BSP. MAA has relied on DDS to provide assurances and documentation of the Behavior Review Committee (RCRC). This has largely been work done by Case Managers. Going forward MAA will receive quarterly RCRC reports and will review and comment upon report and convey findings, recommnendations and if needed request for remediation plan with action steps and suggested timeframe back to DDS. n mlkj n mlkj i In locations where participants require assistance wi th medication administration, medication regimens are reviewed every thirty days by the supervising RN. This review includes a review of the prescribed medications and treatments and a review of the medication administration records. DDS completes a Health Risk Assessment and prepares an annual Health Care Management Plan for each participant that includes critical information regarding medication, other treatments and health care needs. The DDS Case Manager reviews this plan during each monitoring visit for continued accuracy and to monitor if health care needs are being carried out. . The frequency of these visits ranges from 8 to 12 (monthly) times a year depending upon the needs of the participant. The Case Manager Monitoring Tool is used to structure and document the Page 123 of 169 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov 20, 2007 10/25/2007 https://www.hcbswaivers.net/CMS/faces/protected/print/PrintSelector.jspii. of State Oversight and Follow-Up. Describe: (a) the method(s) that the State uses to ensure that participant medications are managed appropriately, including: (a) the identification of potentially harmful practices (e.g., the concurrent use of contraindicated medications); (b) the method(s) for following up on potentially harmful practices; and, (c) the State agency (or agencies) that is responsible for follow-up and oversight. review. The Alert process is initiated if a case manager identifies any concerns. An Alert is entered into the DDS Alert data system and is directed to the appropriate clinical, investigative or technical assistance unit in DDS for action. This information is aggregated and reported as part of the DDS Program Integrity oversight and subsequent reporting to MAA. Participants identified as High Risk for health reasons that may include the particular medication regimen or the use of psychotropic medication are monitored by a DDS Nurse at a frequency determined by the Chief of Clinical Services (Policy for Registered Nurse Monitoring of Individuals Identified as High Risk, MRDDA Policy 10.2, effective 10/10/06). The High Risk Review protocol is used and documented for each participant. The High Risk Review is conducted along with the DDS case manager, who again would initiate the Alert process is any component of the participant's plan or overall care was found to be deficient. T he use of medications to manage behavior is also governed by the MRDDA Policy on the Use of Psychotropic Medications effective November 1, 2001. This policy establishes the guidelines, protocols, procedures and oversight mechanisms for the use of psychotropic medications for DDS participants. The use of psychotropic medications may only be permitted if the participant has an Axis 1 diagnosis and its use must be incorporated into the participant's Behavior Support Plan and approved through the DDS Human Rights C ommittee process. Participants who use psychotropic medications prescribed must be reviewed monthly by the psychiatrist. Informed consent is required from the participant and/or family member or guardian. If no family member or guardian is available and informed consent cannot be provided by the participant, then the participant's team must locate an alternate surrogate decision maker. If the participant is not supported by a residential provider, the Case Manager is responsible for monitoring the participant's response to the medication and any suspected side effects, and submitting DDS Psychotropic Medication Monitoring Form to the prescribing psychiatrist for the monthly monitoring. Additionally, a nurse or psychiatrist must complete an assessment for tardive dyskenesia at least every 6 months. The Case Manager is also responsible for informing the day/vocational provider of any changes. The use of medications to manage behavior is also included in the case management monitoring protocol and the High Risk Nursing protocols for review. This will occur 8-12 times per year depending on the specific circumstances of the participant. Findings from these reviews are aggregated and reported as part of the DDS Program Integrity oversight and subsequent reporting to MAA. Specific follow-up to concerns or potential h armful practices are entered into the DDS Alert system or may rise to the level of being entered into the Incident Management system. In both cases additional monitoring and oversight occurs through the use of these data systems by Case Management Supervisors, the INEU, the Program Integrity Unit and by MAA. DDS, DOH and MAA all review medication management during each agency's respective review p rocess. DDS reviews the provider's compliance with all medication management and administration practices during the Basic Assurances review. DDS also monitors Incident Reporting that surfaces through the Incident Review Committee. Incidents may reveal adverse reactions from medication use, improper use of psychotropic medications, an increase in behavioral incidents, and an increase in the frequency of unanticipated hospitalizations or use of emergency medical services as examples. Any trend or incident that raises concern is followed up by the case manager, or a nurse or clinician from DDS and tracked for resolution by Unit supervisors through the Alert system. DOH/HRA licensing of group home settings pursuant to Chapter 35 regulations also includes medication review. Deficiencies in any area are reported through the licensing visit documentation and forwarded to DDS. The DDS Quality Improvement Unit assures the completion of an acceptable plan of correction, and offers technical assistance to manage the plan of correction process as needed. MAA also completes a record review including medication administration and management on a quarterly basis during the on-site sub-sample monitoring review as part of that Unit' s oversight activities. MAA reports are shared with DDS; DDS is responsible for appropriate follow-up for participants and/or systemic issues i dentified at the service location, provider or District system at large. The DDA compile and share information from the alert system with MAA?

Through the assurance quarterly reporting process DDA is reporting follow-up action and resolution. Upon review MAA reviews and provides recommendations as warranted to DDA. n mlkj n mlkj i The Board of Nursing developed a policy, training cu r riculum, and certification that provides for medication administration by direct support staff. Medication Administration and Self-Administration is governed by DC Municipal Regulations Title 17, Chapter 61. Staff that seek certification to administer medications must pass a CPR course for health care providers, a First Aid course, submit a police clearance and pass a Medication Administration course approved by the DC Board of Nursing. Staff must pass the written exam with no less than 80% correct, receive a score of 100% in the practicum, and have at least one year of experience. The supervising RN must then delegate authority to the staff to administer medications. Medication administration records (MAR) must include the name of the participant, name of the program, the month and year the medication is prescribed for administration, the primary and secondary diagnosis, any k nown allergies of the participant, the diet order for the participant, the name of the licensed practitioner under whose care the participant has been placed, the name of the supervisory registered nurse responsible for the review and preparation of the MAR, and the supervision, monitoring and delegation of nursing functions with respect to the participant. All new medication orders must be reviewed by the supervisory nurse within 24 hours. MRDDA (DDS) psychotropic medication policy also requires additional training. Direct care staff shall receive job-related training that focuses on the potential need for psychotropic medication, the effectiveness of the medication and the development of side effects. Case managers, group home managers and nursing personnel are expected to attend a Comprehensive Training that includes symptoms of mental illness, specific behavioral equivalents of mental illnesses, psychotropic medication classes, side effects, adverse behavioral effects of antiepileptic medications, use of standardized side effect assessment scales, recognizing when to contact medical personnel, HCFA Safety Precautions for Psychopharmacological Medications for People with Developmental Disabilities, International Consensus Conference on Psychopharmacology Guidelines for the Use of Psychotropic Medications with Individuals with Developmental Disabilities, and documentation requirements. Serious or multiple medication errors must be reported by the supervisory nurse to the DC Board of Nursing Page 125 of 169 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov 20, 2007 10/25/2007 https://www.hcbswaivers.net/CMS/faces/protected/print/PrintSelector.jspiii. Medication Error Reporting. S elect one of the following: Providers that are responsible for medication administration are required to both record and report medication errors to a State agency (or agencies). Complete the following three items: (a) Specify State agency (or agencies) to which errors are reported: (b) Specify the types of medication errors that providers are required to record: (c) Specify the types of medication errors that providers must report to the State: Providers responsible for medication administration are required to record medication errors but make information about medication errors available only when requested by the State. Specify the types of medication errors that providers are required to record: iv. State Oversight Responsibility. Specify the State agency (or agencies) responsible for monitoring the performance of waiver providers in the administration of medications to waiver participants and how within 24 hours, in addition to the report to DDS. The Board notifies the staff person that a written response t o the error must be submitted within 3 business days. The Board may require the staff person to re-take the class and practicum. After two such findings, the staff person will lose the certification to administer medications. General re-certification is required every two years. On a monthly basis the supervisory nurse must document the staff person's compliance with the proper administration of each participant's medications, and their ability to monitor signs and symptoms, and demonstrate proper storage and clean up techniques. Each staff person must receive 24 hours of in-service training each year from the supervisory nurse. Participants may also self-administer their medications. An initial assessment is completed to determine the level of support the participant requires in the area of medication administration. The three options are participant self-administration, administration of the medication by a trained staff person and administration of the medication by a LPN or RN. If the participant is found to be capable to self- administer, the participant is re-evaluated on a monthly basis to assure continued capacity to self -administer their medications. n mlkj i DDS receives all incident reports. The District Board of Nursing also receives incident reports when the medication is administered by unlicensed staff. 1. Wrong Person; 2 . Wrong Medication; 3. Wrong Dose; 4. Wrong Route; 5.

Appendix H: Quality Management Strategy ( 1 of 2) Under \u00a71915(c) of the Social Security Act and 42 CFR \u00a7441.302, the approval of an HCBS waiver requires that CMS determine that the State has made satisfactory assurances concerning the protection of participant health and welfare, financial accountability and other elements of waiver operations. Renewal of an existing waiver is contingent upon review by CMS and a finding by CMS that the assurances have been met. By completing the HCBS waiver application, the State s pecifies how it has designed the waiver's critical processes, structures and operational features in order to meet these assurances. /square6Quality Management is a critical operational feature that an organization employs to continually determine whether it operates in accordance with the approved design of its program, meets statutory and regulatory assurances and requirements, achieves desired outcomes, and identifies opportunities for improvement. CMS recognizes that a state's waiver Quality Management Strategy may vary depending on the nature of the waiver target population, the services offered, and the waiver's relationship to other public programs, and will extend beyond regulatory requirements. However, for the purpose of this application, the State is expected to have, at the minimum, systems in place to measure and improve its own performance in meeting six specific waiver assurances and requirements. I t may be more efficient and effective for a Quality Management Strategy to span multiple waivers and other long-term care services. CMS recognizes the value of this approach and will ask the state to identify other waiver programs and long-term care services that are addressed in the Quality Management Strategy. Quality management is dynamic and the Quality Management Strategy may, and probably will, change over time. Modifications or updates to the Quality Management Strategy shall be submitted to CMS in conjunction with the annual report required under the provisions of 42 CFR \u00a7441.302(h) and at the time of waiver renewal. Quality Management Strategy: Minimum Components The Quality Management Strategy that will be in effect during the period of the waiver is included as Attachment #1 to Appendix H. The Quality Management Strategy should be no more than ten-pages in length. It may reference other documents that provide additional supporting information about specific elements of the Quality Management Strategy. Other documents that are cited must be available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if appropriate). In the QMS, a state spells out: /square6The evidence based discovery activities that will be conducted for each of the six major waiver assurances; /square6The remediation processes followed when problems are identified in the implementation of each of the assurances; /square6The system improvement processes followed in response to aggregated, analyzed information collected on each of the assurances; /square6The correspondent roles/responsibilities of those conducting discovery activities, assessing, remediating and improving system functions around the assurances; and /square6The process that the state will follow to continuously assess the effectiveness of the QMS and revise it as necessary and appropriate. If the State's Quality Management Strategy is not fully developed at the time the waiver application is submitted, the state may provide a work plan to fully develop its Quality Management Strategy, including the specific tasks that the State plans to The DC Nursing Board receives incident reports from the supervising Nurse in a provider agency and may c onduct an investigation. If a staff person has made a serious error or has a pattern of errors, the certification to administer medications may be removed. DDS monitors medication administration through incident report trend analysis, during the Provider Basic Assurances review, during case manager monitoring visits and during nursing reviews completed for participants identified as High Risk. DOH/HRA Licensing activities also include review of medication administration practices; DOH/HRA reports any deficiencies to DDS for follow -up action and resolution.

When the Quality Management Strategy spans more than one waiver and/or other types of long-term care services under the Medicaid State plan, specify the control numbers for the other waiver programs and identify the other long-term services that are addressed in the Quality Management Strategy. Appendix H: Quality Management Strategy ( 2 of 2) Attachment #1 The Quality Management Strategy for the waiver is: A ttachment #1 to Appendix H: The D.C. Department on Disabilities Services(DDS)has designed and initiated a comprehensive revision of its quality assurance and improvement systems. In the DDS, the Program Integrity Division will lead this overall effort in collaboration with the DDS Administration and Waiver Units and MAA. Program Integrity (PI)is comprised of the Quality Improvement (QI) Branch and the Basic Assurance (BA) Branch. This Division plays a major role in the overall quality management strategy for the waiver program. The Quality Enhancement (QE) Division is charged with the following: Reviewing the DDS service delivery system; Identifying areas in need of improvement; Engaging in continuous quality improvement through data analysis and trending/tracking of different data streams within DDS; Providing technical assistance to DDS and the provider community in licensure, approval and basic assurances, and ensuring the essential elements of ongoing quality improvement and management. The BA Branch carries out DDS's new BA Authorization Process, the quality review process to evaluate DDS providers of service. DDS has an established Quality Improvement Committee (QIC)that is responsible for reviewing the quality of the District's service delivery system, identifying broad areas of improvement, and following the implementation of recommendations. All reports are disseminated to the DDS Management Advisory Committee and Medical Assistance Administration (MAA). Additional Quality Management(QM)strategies and activities are carried out by the DDS Medicaid Waiver Unit, the Case Management Division, Incident Management Unit and the Medical Assistance Administration (MAA). MAA is available to provide remedial training and education in all areas of waiver assurances when indicated, maintains an encounter log of all contacts and communications between MAA and DDS, and conducts weekly calls with DDS to ensure coordination and monitoring of DDS activities. The following sections of the Quality Management Strategy detail the activities and functions of these entities. I. Six Assurances A.

Three parents 10.Representative of Georgetown University Center The DDS Administrator presents information, reports and analysis for discussion and quality improvement recommendations. DDS conducts a service authorization audit for a 10% sample of all waiver participants on a monthly basis. This s ample is randomly drawn each month with exclusions made for participants reviewed in the previous 11 months. The Quality Improvement Unit verifies that the service(s) was initiated in a timely manner, and an on-site verification process confirms that the service was in fact delivered by confirmation through at least three of four methods: case manager interview; participant interview; record review and observation of the service delivery. Deficiencies or concerns are reported to the DDS Waiver Unit for follow-up. Claims for the DDS waiver services are based on approved services that have been rendered to waiver participants, authorized in the Plan of Care and billed by the appropriate agency representative. Independent audits heretofore have not been required. However, the DC Office of the Inspector General conducts audits, as indicated, or as requested by DDS if financial practices are questioned under the authority of the Human Care Agreement, DDS may also request that a provider have an independent audit completed of its program based on concerns identified through the service authorization review process. To monitor the financial billing of the agencies, monthly claims are available from the fiscal intermediary, currently ACS Government Healthcare Solutions. DDS is currently developing a fiscal billing audit process for implementation prior to the requested start date of this waiver. The process will closely mirror the Elderly a nd Persons with Disabilities (EPD) waiver program administered by MAA as described below. Presently DDS reviews all claims made on a monthly basis to identify discrepancies against the service authorizations. As the program grows it is expected that a sample method will be utilized as described below. Monitoring: The MAA fiscal intermediary tabulates the expenditures of each agency on a monthly basis. 1. DDS reviews each participant's cost of services at the initial service request and during change of service request. 2. DDS reviews at least two agencies each month. A 100% sample of all claims/expenditures is requested from ACS at the beginning of each month. Indices of services on claims reviewed are: a . Unduplicated participant; b. Average payment per participant; c. Claims count; and d. Total sum service. 3. Agencies reporting high dollar expenditure and low numbers of participants or where other discrepancies seem to exist are first reviewed by DDS Waiver Unit staff. If irregularities are confirmed, DDS will refer the case to the MAA Surveillance and Utilization Review System (SURS). Additional triggers for review are: a. Providers whose acuity fall outside of the norm (exceptional file); b. Low utilization of approved plan; and c. Hospitalization claims of DDS Waiver participants. 4. The District submits annual CMS 372/373 reports. 5. The District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR)- entitled \"Home and Community-based Waiver Services for Persons who have Developmental Disabilities\"- are the rules that govern reimbursement by the District of Columbia. These rules are available to the public. MAA completes an on-site review of five participants on a quarterly basis as a component of the Medicaid Agency Oversight. This review includes a financial audit component to verify documentation sufficient to justify billing and Page 142 of 169 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov 20, 2007 10/25/2007 https://www.hcbswaivers.net/CMS/faces/protected/print/PrintSelector.jspAppendix I: Financial Accountability I -2: Rates, Billing and Claims (1 of 3) a.

State laws, regulations, and policies referenced in the description are available upon request to CMS through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable). additional quality measures relating to provider participation requirements. MAA has contracted with Bert Smith, Inc. to complete the independent audit required by the Single Audit Act. The District has changed the process such that environmental modifications providers are Medicaid providers. The District will not be using a streamlined provider agreement for environmental modifications at this time. (Non Federal Matching Funds) MAA and DDS have agreed, as a condition of their MOU that MAA will provide the first $2.9 million dollars in District or Local funding. After the $2.9 Million in Local is spent DDS agrees to provide the additional local revenue. This authorization of Local funding is decided annually and comes from the District's General Fund Revenues but is allocated and appropriated by the District and approved by the District Council with each new Fiscal Year. In this case the DDS has requested adequate Local funding which was approved and \"indexed\" in their DDS FY 2008 budget. In addition, both the Executive Office of the Mayor and the District Council recognize the importance of the MRDD Waiver and both have pledged their support and have formally stated that these Waiver issues are a priority and adequate MRDD funding will be in place. Rate Methodologies for the Department of Developmental Service - April 2007 T he District of Columbia MAA Office of Audit and Finance is responsible for all rate development with the assistance of program staff from the Department of Developmental Disabilities. Together, MAA and DDS staff develop rates for each DDS waiver service. The rate information is available to participants upon request and is available on the www.adrcdc.org website. MAA solicits input through the Notice of Rule Making process and through the publication of proposed rates in the actual waiver applications drafts that are posted to the MRDDA website for public information and comment. The rate process includes market analysis as well as: 1. A review of rate structures utilized in surrounding jurisdictions: (Maryland, Virginia and Delaware); 2. Analysis of rate methodologies used in Maryland, Delaware, Arizona, Connecticut, Louisiana, and Washington State; 3. Meetings held with providers and community stakeholders to assess any outstanding issues as well as provide information and receive clear understanding of community needs and concerns; 4. A review and comparison of prevailing rates for specific services offered under the State Plan benefits; and 5. A review and assessment of expertise and capacity of providers and services. Rate information for Medicaid participants and community members is provided on-line through the www.adrcdc.org website. Transmittal Letters from the MAA Director are sent to each provider indicating any changes or modifications in rates and rate structure. Waiver service rates are closely evaluated based on a geographic market analysis. This includes a review of service providers across the District of Columbia, Suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia within each of the Waiver services. Each service is reviewed and compared to providers offering services in surrounding jurisdictions and to geographic differences and provider supply. There is no automatic inflation increase. In January 2006, direct care worker rates (excluding nursing) were adjusted to provide a more realistic rate in line with neighboring jurisdictions and consistent with a DC Council mandate to provide a rate more acceptable for direct care workers, specifically a living wage rate. The change in rate was designed to stabilize the pool of workers. A review of the industry indicated that there was significant turnover of workers based on low wages and no benefits.

Flow of Billings. Describe the flow of billings for waiver services, specifying whether provider billings flow directly from providers to the State's claims payment system or whether billings are routed through other intermediary entities. If billings flow through other intermediary entities, specify the entities: Appendix I: Financial Accountability I -2: Rates, Billing and Claims (2 of 3) c.Certifying Public Expenditures (select one) : also factored into the rate increase as described below. D DS has researched other DD Waiver state programs for customary rate development models in use. This waiver application contains several new services designed to improve the quality of care, and increase options for successful community living. The District holds as a high priority the need to attract new qualified providers of services, the n eed to have logical rate structures that can support the specific needs of participants, and the need to add new service model options. Additionally, the District is aggressively analyzing its current methods of payment to providers where local funds are used rather than waiver services. As the District does not require cost reports under the waiver, other states where such data exists were used in cost modeling exercises. In some cases, multiple services that had been offered in one setting, such as Independent Habilitation, Attendant Care and Skilled Nursing, were confusing and difficult to audit. New rates are under development that would encompass the traditional support for care and supervision outside of the family home taking into account habilitation time needs, support and supervision needs and medical or behavioral clinical oversight supports under Residential Habilitation and Supported Living services in the DDS waiver application. The rate models for hourly unit services are comprised of: an average wage for the staff person based on US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data and neighboring jurisdictions; an average percentage for mandatory and optional employee related expenses (FICA, FUDA, Worker's Comp, health insurance, etc) drawn from practices and data in the aforementioned states; a standard percentage of indirect costs related to supervision, training, clinical oversight and support, from data available in the District for costs paid using local dollars under Human Care Agreements and from other states; and, a standard administrative percentage. In facility-based day habilitation, pre-vocational and supported employment programs a factor is added to address physical plant requirements, attendance factors, and is further adjusted for participant needs as it relates to the size of the group in facility-based pre-vocational and day habilitation programs and group supported employment services. Additional factors are also incorporated for group living settings, again which reflect the size of the home or number of participants who reside in geographic proximity and take into account the specific support needs of the participant as it relates to the group. These will be represented by a daily per diem. Host Home rates are based on practices in other states, using a acuity based rate as a set percentage of the SL daily rates. A transparent rate methodology that identifies specifically what is covered in the rate will permit new providers to make sound judgments about their ability to deliver quality service in the District. Some rates will be increased as they had not previously factored in indirect costs so critical to the support of participants with developmental disabilities that are not necessarily needed for the State Plan population groups. New services such as Companion Care and Host Home are lower cost services and will expand living options. Fiscal effort will be drawn from the local dollars previously supporting potentially waiver eligible service elements. The District Medicaid Management Information System is operated by a CMS approved external Fiscal I ntermediary (FI). This FI is responsible for the operation of the MMIS system and the claims payment system that uses HIPAA compliant codes. The company providing these FI services is entitled Affiliated Computer Services (ACS). ACS has a District-based Office designed to allow staff to work directly with MAA to address any concerns on a daily basis regarding claims as well as claims details. The direct provider of waiver services submits billing electronically or on paper directly to the MMIS claims payments system. Billing is paid out every two weeks for routine fee-for-service provider claims that are on a regular payment schedule for electronic claims. Payment is slightly longer for paper check claims and mailings, and is on a case-by-case basis for special claims. ACS normally processes all claims associated with the DDS waiver every two weeks. ACS also employs a Community Representative to work with MAA and DDS to address DDS waiver provider and billing issues and offer training to address payment questions and provide detailed information. MAA and DDS staffs receive from the MMIS Fiscal Intermediary training on how to best use the MMIS system to review claims.

Public agencies directly expend funds for part o r all of the cost of waiver services and certify their public expenditures (CPE) in lieu of billing that amount to Medicaidn mlkj g fedc g fedc The CMS-approved MMIS will be used to process all claims made under the waiver. This system is currently o perated by a fiscal intermediary, ACS Government Healthcare Solutions. In order to ensure that waiver services are reimbursed only when the services were required by the Plan of Care, DDS and MAA forward key service components to the office of Information Systems of ACS (Fiscal Intermediary) which will input the covered services into the system within 10 days of receipt of the electronic Prior Authorization. MAA must forward the information to ACS, the Fiscal Intermediary, within 3 months of receipt. Prior to payment of a claim, the system will cross check the date and type of service with those specified in the Plan of Care. E ligibility of a participant is verified monthly before each claim is paid. The Income Maintenance Administration, Bureau of Program Operations is responsible for evaluating the eligibility of each Medicaid applicant on a recurring basis, as described in the State Plan, Attachment 4.22-A. Those participants presenting an 853 waiver code are verified as eligible on specified date. MRDDA Policy 14.5, Service Authorization Policy, effective November 1, 2006, establishes standards and procedures that govern the way Service Authorization System (SAS) identifies the appropriate funding stream for payment of services and supports as identified in the Plan of Care. Billing does not start until implementation. Services are validated through several methods: The DDS Service Authorization Unit conducts a monthly service authorization review to verify services have been initiated through 1. Calls to agencies to ascertain start of care; 2. Calls or visits to participants to validate if services were started; 3. Validation of time and attendance sheets; Page 145 of 169 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: DC.0307.02.00 - Nov 20, 2007 10/25/2007 https://www.hcbswaivers.net/CMS/faces/protected/print/PrintSelector.jspe.

In year 2, it is estimated that service selection will shift to reflect the new service options as participants increase knowledge of options and service providers grow. Given the significant disparity in the two reporting years, this application uses an average LOS of 75% for years 1 and 2 to reflect changes in numbers of participants and service patterns. For years 3-5 inclusive, an average of the two reporting years will be used to project particpant length of stay, or 86%. This estimate is made as best judgement due to the fluctuations present in the history of the waiver use to date. YEAR 1: 1 . In-home support from FY 06 claims data for participants not residing in Supervised Apt settings, Group Homes or Community Residential Facilities. Includes all claims for attendant care, Independent Habilitation, companion, chore, personal care and homemaker. Assumes same average number of units will be utilized. 2 . Supported Living based on average costs per person from FY 06 waiver claims data and Human Care Agreements local costs data. Includes all residential support services such as attendant care, independent habilitation and personal care, and nursing costs. 3. Res Hab based on average costs per person from FY 06 waiver claims data and Human Care Agreements costs data. Includes all residential support services and nursing costs. 4. Services that align with current waiver are based on FY 06 claims data. 5. PT, OT, SPL and Nutrition add utilization from Human Care Agreements in addition to FY 06 waiver claims data. 6. Live in caregiver and Host Home. Professional estimate of number of participants who would choose these support arrangements. 7. Behavior Supports and Community Support Team based on claims utilization in FY 06 for Crisis Preventions services under current waiver.

T he estimates of Factor D' for each waiver year are included in Item J-1. The basis of these estimates is as follows: iii. Factor G Derivation. The estimates of Factor G for each waiver year are included in Item J -1. The basis of YEAR 2 S ervice rates increased by Home Health Market Basket CPI of 3.2%. Year 2 projects higher utilization for most services as the year 1 enrollees experience a full year of service. The additional 100 participants will be the result of converting 100 participants to the HCBS waiver from community ICF/MR settings. Specific details follow. 1. In-home supports: decrease by 25 participants who move to out-of-home settings. Increase utilization to 20 hours per week of support. 2. Supported Living rates will be based on acuity of participants needs. Project 100 participants will remain in 1:1 services, and the remaining 282 participants will on average split evenly between 2 person and 3 person settings. 3. Res Hab rates will be developed to reflect intensity of service needs. Project 1/3 of existing year 1 participants plus 100 participants transitioning from ICF/MR will require intensive supports, and the remaining 2/3 of the year 1 participants will require basic res hab level services. 4. Day Hab, add an additional 60 participants from the 100 participants transferring from ICF/MR. Increase utilization to a full year of anticipated service levels, 212 days for approximately 5 hours per day. 5. Pre-vocational, add 20 participants from the ICF/MR group, and increase utilization to full service levels as above. 6. SE Placement, increase participants by 10 for general growth in service interest. 7. SE follow-along services, increase participants by 10 and increase utilization to 22.4 hours per week. 8. Group SE services, increase participants by 10 and utilization as above. 9. Group and hourly Respite, increase participants to 1/3 of participants receiving in-home supports. Hourly respite increase utilization to 80% of allowable service amount. 10. Live-in companion, increase growth by 10 participants and room and board costs by 2%. 11. Dental increase participants by 100 for participants transitioning from ICF/MR. Raise rate by 4.2% for MCPI. 12. PT, OT, SPL, Nutrition and Behavior Supports, add 50 participants each from those transitioning from ICF/MR. 13. Skilled Nursing increase utilization to 10 visits per year. 14. Community Support Team add 10 participants (10% of new). 15. Host Home add 15 participants a year as interest and provider base grows. Movement from in-home supports. 16. PERS, add 9 each year per historical utilization. 17. Professional services, double participants based on increased awareness of service options and increased available providers of service in year 2. 18. Transportation increase for vocational by 90 participants to account for ICF/MR participants transferring to HCBS waiver. Community access transportation remains the same. YEAR 3 All Rates increase by 3% per Home Halth Market Basket CPI projections. 1. In-home reduce by 25 as participants gain out of home supports. 2. SL remains the same number of participants. 3. Res Hab, increase by 75 to intensive levels and 25 people to basic levels to account for 100 additional participants transferring from ICF/MR settings. 4. Professional service participants increase by 1/3 over year 2. YEAR 4 and YEAR 5 Same assumptions as Year 3 with additional 3% inflationary increase based on Home Health Market Basket CPI projections each year. Paid claims MAA data for the Reporting period 11/20/05 -11/19/06, inflated 3.3% each year from FFY 2007 t hrough FFY 2012. Prescription drug costs for dual-eligible participants have been removed by determining average paid claims for those participants in the reporting period 11/05 to 11/06, and determining the percentage of dual eligible participants in the target group. For dual-eligible participants a charge of $55.00 per month per dual eligible participant is returned to CMS to account for and remove the costs of prescribed drugs.
