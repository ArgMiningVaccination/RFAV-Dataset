As you begin your professional preparation in the fields of Speech- Language Pathology or Audiology, we look forward to facilitating your clinical education expe riences. We hope to give you many \"tools\" that will empower you in this process. This handbook is the first of many resources. It is designed to assist you with information related to the clinical aspects of our graduate programs (e.g., Speech and Hearing Science Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology , 7143/7243/7343/7891 , 6843, and 8943) and in your pursuit of meeting standards for state licensure and/or national certifications. The information is intended to outline expectations during Clinical Semi nars in Hearing 7143/7243/7343/7891 and 6843 enrollment as well as the policies, procedures, and clinical operations of the Ohio State University Speech -Language -Hearing Clinic. Another specific resource for Clinical Seminars in Hearing 7143/7243/7343/7891 and 6843 courses is the Carmen/Canvas website. It is your responsibility to closely review this information and use it to guide your clinical experiences. Doing so will facilitate an excellent experience for patients, will allow for appropriate clinical operations, will provide good transition from one clinician to another, and promote a successful learning experience. The Ohio State University Speech- Language -Hearing Clinic provides doctoral clinicians the opportunity to obtain clinical experience in a business -oriented environment. This clinical environment allows for professional preparation not only in clinical service provision, but also in related aspects of speech-language pathology and audiology, including managed care, marketing, and quality mana gement. With these learning opportunities come responsibilities and expectations similar to those that will be encountered in other professional work settings. Providing supervised services to patients and their families in this clinic is a privilege affor ded to graduate clinicians, and you will be expected to operate in a professional manner at all times. Consequences for violations of clinic policy are enforced uniformly for all clinical personnel and are similar to those that would be encountered in othe r work settings. After reviewing this handbook, if you are uncertain about a procedure/policy or if you have a specific concern, you should ask/inform someone who has the ability to address these issues-- your clinical preceptor ,clinical advisor, or clinic al director. The most successful interactions come from being well - informed and maintaining ongoing communication with the clinical faculty Your clinical preceptors are more than willing to discuss your le arning needs and individual clinical cases with you. Go to them, but be willing to start the discussion with the information that this handbook provides along with other constructive information that you have gathered from your academic courses and previous clinical exper iences. We wish you the best of success in your educational endeavor. Gail M.

Throughout your clinical experiences, you are under the auspices of The Ohio State University Department of Speech and Heari ng Science and The Ohio State University Speech- Language -Hearing Clinic (OSU SLHC). You are expected to adhere to all policies and procedures outlined in this handbook, those provided to you in SHS 6843; 8943 (Audiology Practicum and Clinic Seminars) and/or those posted on Carmen/Canvas. Requirements and Policies for SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum Experiences in Audiology 1: Clinical Registration 1.1 - Prerequisites A. All students intending to enroll in SHS 6843 ( Practicum in Audiology) must have successfully completed the applicable SHS Clinica l Seminars in Speech & Language and/or Hearing Disorders . B. All Audiology students must take all of the SHS Clinical Seminars in Hearing Disorders course s in the sequence offered. C. Students wishing to enroll in an opposite area course (e.g. speech/language pathology) must obtain the permission of the instructor. 1.2 - Credit Hours A. All students enrolled in SHS 6843 or 8943 must enroll in the prescribed number of credit hours, unless otherwise advised . a. Students are responsible for consulting the curriculum information provide d in Graduate Handbook 2018- 2019 V.1 and registering for the correct courses each semester. B. Actual c linical assignments may vary from semester to semester. Each student is to indicate request s on the CF -02a for audiology hours . 1.3 - CF -02a: Student Schedule A. All students enrolled in SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum Experiences in Audiology/ Hearing Disorders and expecting to enroll in clinical practicum are to submit CF -02a (Audiology Request) indicating their class and/or work schedules and practicum requests respectively. B. Appropriate form(s) should be submitted to the OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator (currently , Christy Goodman, AuD) by the date provided in the clinic calendar. 6 | Page Revised August, 2021 1.4 - Other Clinical Experience A. For Audiology s tudents in their first 3 years, clinical experience obtained through courses other than SHS 6843, as a stipend requirement, or as part of an employment contract will not generally be counted toward the total required clinical hours. The exception to this rule wil l be in the case of a stipend recipient who is enrolled in 6843, and the Clinic Committee deems the assignment acceptable. Only those hours consistent with credit obtained through th e 6843 assignment will be counted. A student receiving a stipend from a pr acticum site and desiring to accrue clinical hours while working at the site is required to be enrolled in 6843. B. Potential practicum sites are vetted by the OSU SLHC Audiology Coordinator using the Audiology Clinical Training Site Questionnaire and the Pr eceptor Date Form (see Appendix). These are stored in the Coordinator's office in individual clinical placement site folders. The Preceptor Data Forms are used to ensure each preceptor holds a valid Ohio audiology license and to confirm their level of ex perience in the field. The Audiology Clinical Training Site Questionnaire is used to determine the types of diagnostic procedures, treatment procedures, and the possible populations seen at a clinical site. An Affiliation Agreement is signed by the Univers ity and the director of the clinical facility to designate responsibilities of the university and the outside clinical facility. The Coordinator reviews the students CF06 (form name) at the end of the semester to ensure the experience documented met expectations. Each student complete s a Preceptor Evaluation Form evaluating the individual preceptor and sharing positives and negatives of the clinical placement. The Coordinator reviews the Preceptor Evaluation Forms at the end of each semester to help determine their ongoing role in our clinical education program. C. For 4th year students in Audiology, the preceptorship/externship may be a paid experience . However , this is arra nged in conj unction with the 4th year placement made by the Clinic Director, who is the 4th year placement coordinator, and initially NOT directly negotiated by the student. The student may be asked to sign an employment agreement with the site as the placement is negotiated . Stipend/payment arrangements will be made in conjunction with the University, the student, and the 4th year site(s). All students in a 4th year placement must enroll in 3 -credits of SHS 8943 each term . 1.5 - Technology Skills A. All students who are enrolled or plan to enroll in SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology need to have strong computer skills. The OSU SLHC computers are PC with Microsoft products; therefore, documents submitted electronically to preceptor s are expected to be produced using Microsoft applications. 1.6 - Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology: 7143/7243/7343/7891, 6843, Eligibility A. Only students with \"regular\" graduate student status in the Speech and Hearing Science program and who have completed the Department's undergraduate courses or their equivalents are permitted to enroll in the SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology series. Students who have been admitted on a \"conditional\" basis or graduate non- degree students are not eligible to enroll in SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology. Furthermore, enrollment is restricted to those degree program students with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above. 7 | Page Revised August, 2021 B. If a student receives a \"U\" (Unsatisfactory) in a SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology course, the student will be prohi bited from enrolling in SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology the following semester. Competency may be demonstrated by repeating the SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology course or by completing a corrective plan of action deemed appropriate by the SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology instructor (s) and the student's Academic and Clinical Advisor s. C. Required graduate courses (i.e., courses directly related to an assigned clinical rotation) must be completed in a satisfactor y manner. If a graduate student receives a grade of \"C+\" or poorer in a required graduate course, the student must retake the course the next time it is offered. Additionally, if the course is directly related to a clinical area (e.g., hearing aids, vestib ular, etc.), the student will be prohibited from participation in a clinical rotation in that area until the deficiency has been corrected. When the CF -02 and/or CF -02a are submitted, a student should not indicate that they have completed the course until the grade of \"B -\" or better is achieved in that course. In addition, should a student earn a grade of C+ or poorer in a designated prerequisite course for a specific disordered population, the student is to complete the form \"Status of Course/Knowledge Competencies\" (See Appendix A ). A copy of this form is to be submitted to the student's academic advisor, clinical advisor, and AuD placement coordinator within 3 days of the grade's posting and before the first day of classes for the semester immediately su bsequent to the semester in which the student was enrolled in the failed course. Unsatisfactory performance (e.g., a grade of C+ or lower) in two or more required courses will result in prohibition from enrollment in all clinical practicum courses. The stu dent may re -enroll in clinic (SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology) after retaking the required courses and achieving a grade of B - or better, such that no more than one unsatisfactory grade remains. The student must continue to show progress by retaking and satisfactorily passing all required courses for which a grade of C+ or less was received. D. If a student receives a \"U\" in SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology for two semesters, the student wi ll be denied further enrollment in the AuD program . E. Once accepted into the program, students are required to meet and maintain technical standards noted in the Department Technical Standards /Essential Functions Document - https://sphs.osu.edu/sites/sphs.osu.edu/files/OSU%20Technical%20Standards%202015.pdf . The student must sign that the technical standard can be achieved with or without accommodations. The student is responsible for making need for accommodation known to the Office of Disability Services at The Ohio State University. Additional information will be provided at Department orientation and in clinical practicum cou rses. F. If any accommodations are needed, the student must establish the need with The Ohio State University Student Life Disability Services Office and develop a plan. Accommodation requests must be documents on the Accommodate Request form ( found on Carm en/Canvas ) and shared with each preceptor , each semester. 1.7 - Clinical Observation Hours 8 | Page Revised August, 2021 A. All students must have completed at least 25 hours of clinical observation prior to enrolling in the first semester of SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology and/or during their first year in the AuD program. B. Appropriate documentation of the observation hours must be filed in the student's clinical folder prior to enrollment. Twenty -five hours of clinical observation must be completed before accruing patient contact hours. Necessary coursework must be documented on CF -02 and CF - 02a clinic request forms. 1.8 - Spoken and Written English Skills and Speech- Language Skills A. Students enrolling in SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology must demonstrate adequate spoken and written American English skills a nd speech/language skills. If a student needs assistance with spoken and written American English and speech/language skills, this should be discussed with the Clinical and Academic Advisors. B. All students are expected to use speech/language skills that reflect professionalism, which includes minimizing dialectal differences and avoiding the use of slang in the clinical relationship. C. Speech/language skills of all clinicians enrolled in SHS Cli nical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology should reflect the nature of the professional clinical relationships. D. Tutoring through the ESL department is available for students with marked pronunciation difficulties. 1.9 - Practicum Clock Hours and Certification A. Students pursuing certification and/or state licensure shall not accumulate practicum hours for services rendered in a facility (or school district) that employs them to deliver professional services. B. This does not include students who are receiving traineeships, scholarships, stipends or 4th year audiology students employed in an approved externship/preceptorship. If, however, salary by an employer is suspended for a period of time or if unreimbursed time is used, clinical hours may be counted, providing: a. The clinical site is approved by the Clinic Committee b. The student is enrolled in SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology c. Written evidence of the financial agreement i s provided by the employer d. The type of acceptable placement is prescribed by the designated clinical coordinator e.

If an extenuating circumstance can be documented, the student must make a formal request to drop or withdraw from SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum Audiology to the Department Chair and the student's academic and clinical advisors. B. The Clinic Committee must review this request and provide input to the chair and advisors prior to a decision being reached. C. If the student is requesting the drop or withdrawal for medical reasons, they are required to provide a letter from their healthcare provider documenting the need for leave from the program and the anticipated length of leave required. D. If a drop or withdraw is approved, the following guidelines are to be followed: a. Any written evaluation from the student's preceptor(s) for the drop/withdraw academic term will be retained in the student's academic file. b. If the withdrawal was for a medical leave, the student must provide a letter from their healthcare provider stating the student can participate in the rigors of a clinic al placement/full time schedule prior to returning to clinical placements. If the student will require accommodations to support their clinical education, they must register with the Office of Disability Services and update their Technical Standard statement as needed. c. Prior to re -enrolling in clinic, the student must successfully complete the agreed upon and required competency assignments. The content of these assignments will be determined by the OSU SHS program clinical preceptor s and shared with the s tudent with specific timelines for completion provided. d. The clinical assignment for the subsequent academic term in which the student may be permitted to enroll in SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology will be based upon the student's clinical competencies/performance at the time that the student dropped or withdrew from clinic. e. Upon re -enrollment in SHS 6843, the student must adhere to the requirements and evaluating the student will follow the guidelines as described in the Clinic Policies, Requirements, and Protocols, Section 1.5, \"Evaluation of Clinical Skills.\" The semester of re -enrollment will be considered a probationary semester and the student will be permitted re -enrollment ONLY if the enrollment procedures outlined above have been f ollowed. Abandonment of patients or clinical responsibilities from the academic term in which the student withdrew will result in permanent removal from the clinical education program in the SHS program at The Ohio State University. If the student receives a failing grade (less than 2.6) during the probationary semester, the student will be permanently removed from the clinical experience through the SHS program at The Ohio State University. 1.22 - Transportation to Practicum Sites A. Students enrolled in SHS 6843 Practicum in Audiology are responsible for providing their own transportation to and from assigned practicum sites, including any travel required to the assigned site's auxiliary locations. 14 | Page Revised August, 2021 B. The Ohio State University assumes no liability for travel. The Department of Speech and Hearing Science advises each student to obtain liability insurance for any travel required as part of the SHS 6843 P racticum in Audiology. 1.23- Messages for students A. EMERGENCY messages may be left in the clinic office (614 -292-6251) or the department office (614- 292-8207) for students in classes or clinical assignments in Pressey Hall. B. Use of audible signal alerts on cell phones is prohibited during class, meetings, pres entations, and clinical assignments. If used as a clock, cell phones are to be discreetly visible during delivery of services. C. Students are encouraged to contact individual preceptors to determine appropriate policies and contacts for emergency situations in those settings. 1.24 - Screenings A. Opportunities to participate in various speech/language/hearing screenings are offered. These opportunities are generally announced via email. B. Screenings are supervised by OSU Clinical preceptor s or speech -language pathologists or audiologists in the com munity, and are open to any student enrolled in SHS 6843 Practicum in Audiology. C. Although screenings are short -term clinical experiences, they are governed by the same guidelines as other SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology placements. D. If a student commits to a screening opportunity, either by contacting the clinical preceptor or \"signing up,\" the st udent is expected to participate in the experience to the full extent of the commitment unless an appropriate excused absence (e.g., illness) is provided and the preceptor is notified prior to the screening. If a student fails to follow through on a commitment to a screening, they may be denied the opportunity to participate in future screenings and may impact future SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology placements. E. Occasionally, a graduate clinician may be contacted directly by a speech/language pathologist or audiologist to assist with a screening opportunity. The graduate clinician should discuss these opportunities with their clinical advisor to assure that the person providing the screening has appropriate licensure and/or certification sta tus and can provide the type of experience which will be both beneficia l and can be applied to completion of required clinical hours for certification and/or licensure. 1.25 - Time Commitment/Management 15 | Page Revised August, 2021 A. Utilization of effective time management skills is a necessary and key component when considering the wide range of excellent opportunities available at The Ohio State University and the surrounding community. B. In addition, it is strongly recommended that a student design a long- term plan for the entire time of enrollment for a graduate degree. Components to take into consideration include the following activities and time commitments required per academic term: a. Coursework/course load b. SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology assignments, including travel time to extended distance rotations c. GAA/GRA/GTA assignments d. Job responsibilities outside the University e. Additional specialization: unique specialization or capstone commitment f. Personal needs (e.g., sleep, exercise, attention to health -related issues, etc.) C. While making a plan, students benefit from taking into consideration that commitments vary in time and responsibility, with some requiring a major investment. D. It is strongly encouraged that students take advantage of these many outstanding learning experiences. At the same time, students will need to take under advisement that participating in a variety of program options will necessitate lon g term, comprehensive planning. E. In addition, taking on several major commitments may necessitate extending the number of academic terms essential to fulfill the requirement of the pursued graduate degree. 2.0 - Clinical Practicum 2.1- Obtaining Clinical Practic um Assignments A. During finals week of each academic term, clinical assignments will be emailed to the students and posted in the clinic . B. Follow all instructions in the email to notify the Audiology Practicum Coordinator regarding any conflicts/concerns. C. AuD students will follow all instructions in emails regarding when to contact outside site preceptor s to learn of any needed documents/requirements for that site. D. Audiology preceptor s are listed in the \"black book\" (hearing aid repair/order book) housed on the Clinic Office Manager's desk. 2.2 - Clinical Practicum Attendance A. Regular attendance for practicum is m andatory. B. Student clinicians are expected to be at their assigned site on their assigned days/times, from the 16 | Page Revised August, 2021 arranged day of orientation through the last day of the University's regular classes/or finals week, per assignment. C. University holidays do not necessarily indicate that the student does not have a clinical practicum site obligation. Attendance on that day is determined by the particular site's preceptor . It is the responsibility of the student to discuss thi s obligation with individual preceptor s and to make the OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator aware of any deviations to the schedule. D. If the site preceptor is unavailable due to his/her schedule (e.g. attendance at a conference, vacation time, extende d illness) the student should inform the OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator . Additionally, the student should inquire if there is another opportunity at that site (e.g. shadow another professional, work with another clinical preceptor , etc.) during that time period . If that is not an option, the student is expected to contact the OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator for any assignment/project or other opportunity that will allow the student to obtain an appropriate clinical experience so that clinical education is not comprised . E. In case of illness or emergency situations, procedures for canceling patients and notifying the appropriate preceptor are determined by the particular practicum site. It is the responsibility of the student to inquire about appropriate procedures and to follow them. In addition, the OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator is to be notified by the student regarding the need to be absent. F. If an extenuating circumstance should arise that requires absence from clinic , this needs to be discussed immediately with the Clinical Preceptor and the OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator (See Absenteeism of Clinician or Patient ). G. If a student will be absent from an assigned site or patient , they must contact the precepto r to make arrangements to make -up the clinic day, depending on the assignment. This make -up is required, unless otherwise determined at the discretion of the site preceptor . H. In the case of a student demonstrating chronic tardiness and/or absence from a clinical assignment action will be initiated by the assigned preceptor and OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator . I. Consequences will be determined on a case by case basis and could include, but are not limited to, a. Formal documentation of the attendance pattern and concern b. Denying clinical hours c. Termination of clinical placement d. Earning a failing grade or 'unsatisfactory' grade for the semester 2.5 - Arranging Clinical Placements A. Students are encouraged to participate in a wide range of clinical experiences, but hours can only be obtained when the OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator has arranged the placement. B. If students are aware of a potential new preceptor or site , the s tudent is encouraged to give that contact information to the OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator . 17 | Page Revised August, 2021 2.6 - Name Tags A. Every student clinician is to wear a nametag while involved in clinical activities in The Ohio State University Speech -Language -Hearing Clinic. B. Procedures for obtaining the nametags will be reviewed in the SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum in Audiology series; also see the Clinic Office Manager for assistance. The Department provides one nametag for a student; in the case that this is lost or there is a change in name, the student will be responsible for replacing the nametag and will need to cover the cost of the nametag. C. Specific sites may require the display of a nametag or ID badge. Each student is responsible for addressing this requirement with the assigned preceptor . 3.0 - Evaluation of Clinical Skills / Clinical Performance 3.1 - The Clinical Preceptor is responsible for : A. Providing feedback to the student throughout each term regarding clinical competency development. B. Conducting pre -term, mid -term and final conferences about the student's performance. C. Assisting development of clinical skills while fostering expansion of clinical strengths. C. Evaluating each student clinician's clinical competencies at the end of each academic term using CF-38 and review the form(s) with the student clinician. After this review the student should sign the written form. One copy of this e valuation form is kept with the clinical advisor and one with the student. a. Assisting a student in identifying professional expectations throughout their enrollment in SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum. Students are expected to follow the stated protoco ls and policies for each site. 3.2 - Graduate Student Responsibilities and Acquisition of Clinical Skills A. Follow and abide by the Department of Speech and Hearing Science Technical Standards/Essential Functions and ASHA, AAA, and/or OSHLA/OAA Codes of Ethics . B. Follow through with preceptor feedback for all clinical practicum assignments. C. Use resources provided in academic and clinical practicum classes to plan and administer clinical skills. D. Turn in all clinical documentatio n on time and in the manner requested by each Clinical Preceptor . E. Keep lines o f communication open by: a. Responding in a timely manner to email, phone calls, and other means of communication 18 | Page Revised August, 2021 with patient s, their caregivers, and your Clinical Preceptor s and Clinical Advisors b. Informing Clinical Advisor and/or OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator of any extenuating cir cumstances that may result in not being able to complete any aspec t of the program c. Inform the OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator immediately of any issues or concerns at outside clinical practicum sites. 3.3 - Clinical Practicum Grading A. Clinical practicum (684 3/8943) is graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis. B. A passing grade in a specific course does not inherently imply that all required clinical or knowledge skills outcomes have been attained. C. To receive a satisfactory grade in 6843/ 8943, one must obtain a minimum competency rating of \"B\" (beginning), \"I\" (intermediate), or \"A\" (advanced). a. 70% of the total clinical hours must be \"I\" or \"A\" competency level in Audiology. b. The preceptor assigns competency ratings, with input from the student. D. It is expected that students demonstrate a forward progression of skills throughout their practicum experiences. a. See S ection 4.5 of this handbook regarding progression of program . b. Should a student not earn criterion of acquisition for specific skills outcomes, the advancement in, and/or completion of the professional program , can be de nied until the identified skill outcomes is/are satisfactorily demonstrated. c. It should be noted that a pattern of demonstrating unsuccessful progress in the acquisition of knowledge and/or clinical skills outcomes may lead to either placing a student on a probationary term and/or denying further enrollment in SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum Experiences in Audiology. E. An unsatisfactory grade in clinic practicum experiences const itutes a competency rating of \"U\" (unsatisfactory ) or \"F\" (failing) on the CF -38 evaluation form . Ratings of \"U \" or \"F\" at any point during the clinical practicum rotations can result in the need to repeat placement. F. Receiving a competency rating of \"U \" or \"F\" in any placement type or competency during t he final semester could result in a delay in graduation due to the need to repeat a placement type or competency area. 3.4 - Guidelines for I dentification and Remediation of P oor C linical Performance and Acquisition of Professional Skills : A. During a clini cal enrollment period, if a Clinical Preceptor identifies a student is not functioning at an expected clinical competency level or conducting him/herself in a professional ma nner, the Clinical Preceptor should immediately discuss this deficiency with the student clinician and help the student develop a plan designed to remediate the deficiencies. If no improvement is noted within a period of no longer than two weeks, the Clinical Preceptor should notify the OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator . 19 | Page Revised August, 2021 a. At the discretion of the OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator , a meeting with all Clinical Preceptor s responsible for the clinician's work that particular academic term will be scheduled with the C linical A dvisor to determine the extent and nature of the student clinician's clinical difficulty. Appropriate recommendations for remediation will also be determined. A decision will be made at that time concerning the advisability of a full clinic staffing (see below) with the student clinician. If such a meeting is recommended, it should occur within two weeks. b. If multiple infractions of any OSU SLHC guidelines and protocols occur, the Clinic Director will be notified about noncompliant behavior. Should degree of noncompliant behavior be judged as egregious, an appropriate plan of action will be determined. Disciplinary action could include, but is not limited to, denial of clinical hours, removal from clinical practicum site, repeat a practicum placement, delayed graduation status , or dismissal from the SHS clinical program. B. At the end of the academic term, if the student clinician's grade is U, a meeting wi th all Clinical Preceptor s* responsible for the student clinician's work that particular term will be scheduled with the student's clinical advisor. This meeting will be to determine the extent and nature of the student clinician's clinical difficulty and to make appropriate recommendations for remediation. A decision will be made at that time concerning the advisability of a full clinic staffing with the student clinician. a. If such a meeting is recommended, it should occur prior to the initiation of or no later than two weeks from the beginning of the next academic term. A full staffing will be held including any C linical Preceptor s* who have supervised the graduate clinician, the clinic advisor, the academic advisor, and the graduate clinician. At this me eting specific behavioral objectives will be set for a plan of action to implement during the said term of Clinic enrollment. This term of enrollment would be on academic probationary status. b. In addition to the above plan of action, if the student in question has received a U, all clinical assignments will be in the OSU SLHC for the subsequent semester . At least one preceptor other than the one(s) who raised the original concern(s) about the student clinician will be assigned to supervise the student. At the end of the probationary period, the C linical A dvisor and graduate clinician will again meet. The members of the clinical faculty who attend this meeting will be determined by the OSU SLHC Au diology Practicum Coordinator . The purpose of this meeting is to inform the student whether the plan of action for clinical performance goals was met. c. If a student does not meet practicum goals and does not earn a grade of S during the enrollment of the p robationary academic term, the student will be permanently removed from clinical experience s through AuD program. The student might have the option to pursue a degree within the Department without the clinical component (MA -SHS) . The student will be counse led as to what other career options and/or career cou nseling that might be available. d. The course of action should include a plan of correction to foster acquisition of the identified skill outcome. This plan is to be designed by the student with input from the instructor of the course, clinical advisor, and academic advisor. 20 | Page Revised August, 2021 e. *Should a preceptor not be available for the meeting, written input regarding the student's performance will be submitted. Documentation of Above a. It is suggested that all formal interactions with the student clinician and members of the clinic staff be documented by a written record. b. Preceptor s will keep a copy of written evaluations (including CF -38) given to the student (file in permanent folder) and make a record of memorandum on the CF -25 when oral evaluations are made. c. If a full staffing is held to evaluate a student clinician's performance, a record of memorandum should be written, along with a copy of the agreed upon behavioral objectives, action plan, and extended CF -118a that the student in question is to accomplish. A copy will be given to the student, with a copy placed in the student's academic folder. d. If a second full staffing occurs, the student's clinical advisor should notify the student clinician via lette r that the meeting is scheduled, the purpose of the meeting, and the agenda for the meeting. Again, a record of memorandum should be written describing the meeting and its outcome. 4.0- Clinical Placement Protocol The OSU SLHC Audiology Coordinator is responsible for all clinic placements except for 4 th year externship placements, which are arranged by the 4th year placement coordinator. 4.1 - Audiology students will complete a CF -02A for the OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator . A. This document indicates the student's class and/or work schedules, previous clinical experiences accrued thus far, and student requests for clinical placements. The CF -02A MUST be returned by the date designated on the OSU SLHC Practicum Calendar and Checkli st each semester. B. Late and/or incomplete forms may impact receiving a clinical placement and could delay progression to graduation. C. Any changes to the student's schedule must be immediately communicated to the OSU SLHC Audiology Coordinator as placement changes can occur throughout the semester. 4.2 - Practicum Placement Considerations: The following factors are considered when students are being placed into clinical placements with the greatest contributing factors being clinical competency and previous experience accrued, student and site schedule, clinical advisor and preceptor input, and student requests. 21 | Page Revised August, 2021 A. Prerequisite academic courses B. Number of observation hours C. Number of clinical hours accrued D. Clinical competency (a student must maintain grades of S in SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum Experiences in Audiology to continue in pra cticum courses and be assigned to clinical experiences outside the OSU SLHC.) E. Site types F. Previous SHS Clinical Seminars and Practicum Experiences in Audiology evaluations ; competency level G. Clinical advisor input H. Preceptor input I. Academic advisor input J. Faculty member input (with regard to specific disorder knowledge skill outcomes) K. Site criteria L. Students' site evaluation by preceptor s/sites M. Schedules of students (e.g. work schedules) N. Location of sites O. Site profiles P. Logistics Q. Student requests 4.3 - Clinical Practicum Transportation Recommendations A. It is recommended that graduate students have the following in place: a. A road -worthy vehicle to provide safe transportation. b. Sufficient funds to support costs of travel. c. A well -defined time management plan to allow for travel time. B. It is anticipated that the 4th year clinical preceptorship/externship for AuD students will likely take place outside of the greater Columbus metropolitan area. This placement is based on factors noted in Section 4.2, in conjunct ion with student preferences, and options available nationally. AuD students are encouraged to consider these factors, along with financial implications of a placement, early in the program. 4.4 - Recommended Sequence of Clinical Experiences in Audiology A. Diagnostic Rotation Levels a. Stage 1: OSU SLHC i. Required for all graduate students in 6843 with an audiology major ii. Required for all students who have no previous clinical experience b. Stage 2: Combined assignment that includes and assignment at the OSU SLHC and an outside site c. Stage 3: Outside sites - a minimum of four assignments are required d. Stage 4: 4 th year clinical assignment: Full time clinical preceptorship /externship over one or more clinical setting which is arranged by the Clinic Director /4th year placement coordinator , with input from the student. 22 | Page Revised August, 2021 B. Habilitation Rotation Levels a. Stage 1: Rehabilitation experience with adult patient s, including hearing aid dispensing. b. Stage 2: Rehabilitation experience with children at an outside site or at The OSU S LHC. C. Students may be at different rotation levels in each of the two above levels, and may be promoted to a higher stage of rotation depending upon: a. The level of clinical competency skills b. Academic preparation Externship/Preceptorship for 4th year AuD students: This clinical experience is designed to be the equivalent of a full time (e.g., approximately 35 -40 hours per week for 50 weeks and/ or as determined in conjunction with the site, student, and University program) placement designed to help the student further integrate their skills and knowledge. In addition, this is an opportunity to obtain in- depth clinical experience in a specific area (e.g., cochlear implants, vestibular assessment and management, etc.) . The design of this plan is initiated during Autu mn semester of the student's 3 rd year in the program. This timeline is similar to the sugge sted timeline for securing a 4th year experience located in Appendix B. Students are asked to provide input into geographic preferences, population preferences (e.g., intraoperative monitoring experiences, pediatrics, etc.), and other factor s, such as financial considerations , time limitations, and enrollment in the AuD/PhD program. The student may choose to present potential options of interest, such as those that may be obtained from the 4th year registry on the American Academy of Audiology website or through the Audiology Clinical Education Network (ACEN) . It should be noted, however, that the student is NOT to make initial contact with the site or potential preceptor prior to discussion with the 4th year placement coordinator (e.g., Clinic Director). The p lacement coordinator will make contacts for each student. Available options can be evaluated by the student, in conjunction with input from the practicum coordinator, clinical advisor, and academic advisor. Students will begin the interview process in Autumn semester or early in Spring semester of their 3rd year, with the goal to complete final placeme nt decisions by March of the 3rd year (for beginning placement May or June of the beginning of the 4th year or at the discretion of the 4th year site). It should be noted that the student will be responsible for providing thei r own transportation to the interview(s) and covering any costs incurred in the interviewing process, if the potential site does not provide financial assistance with this process. Once the site is secured, the 4th year placement coordinator initiates the process to develop an affiliation agreement with the site. Students are discouraged from signing any type of contract or agreement directly with a site and if this situation arises, should speak with the practicum coordinator prior to engaging in any contractual agreement with the site. This is for the protection of the student and of the University. In addition, any requirements from the site (e.g. additional training, liability insurance, health requirements) must be in place prior to initiating clinical practice at that site. Remuneration to be provided to the student should be discussed with the 4 th year placement coordinator prior to the beginning of the placement. All students participating in the 4th year externship must be enrolled in SHS 8943. During the externship, students will \"meet\" with the 4th year Placement Coordinator on a periodic basis via email, Facebook, or Carmen /Canvas discussion in order to track progress of the experience and to discuss the experience. In some cases, the placement coordinator will do an on- site and/or virtual visit with the student and preceptors. If concerns s arise in the experience, the student sh ould immediately contact the 4th year placement coordinator so the University has been alerted to the situation and can work with the student and 23 | Page Revised August, 2021 site/preceptor. Specific hour requirements For all AuD students , the following specific hours must be accrued: a. ASHA requirements for Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) See the 2020 guidelines for the CCC requirements: https://www.asha.org/siteassets/uploadedfiles/asha -audiology- certification - standards -comparison.pdf If the student is pursuing the requiremen ts for the Certificate of Clinical Competence in Audiology, supervised practicum must include experience with patient /patient populations across the life span and from culturally/linguistically diverse backgrounds. Practicum must include experience with patient /patient populations with various types and severities of communication and/or related disorders, differences, and disabilities. ASHA requires 25 observation hours as well as a mandatory hour requirement that is equal to one year of full time employment (approximately 1825 hours) earned during the AuD program. See Appendix C . Only hours that are supervised under the direction of an audiologist with their Certificate of Clinical Competence will be counted toward the student accruing hours for their C's. If a student is pursuing the Certificate of Clinical Competence, all hours must be supervised by an audiologist with their C's (e.g. a preceptor with their C's cannot \"sign off\" on hours accrued under the direction of a prece ptor who does not have their C's). There is a process that provides for a student to obtain the C's after graduation and if a student may be interested in this option, they are encouraged to check the CCC requirements. b. Requirements for Ohio License The c urrent requirements for Ohio license are available at http:// http://shp.ohio.gov Ohio lice nsure requirements are similar to licensure requirements for many other states and may have reciprocity with other states . Students are encouraged to contact the licensure board of a state in which they may be interested in practicing to review these guidelines. c. Ohio State academic programs are designed to prepare students to apply for applicable licensure or certification in Ohio. If you plan to pursue licensure or certification in a state other than Ohio, please review state educational requirements for licensure and certification and state licensing board contact information at go.osu.edu/onground (link is external) . State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA). Ohio State makes every effort to ensure state licensure and certification information is current; however, state requirements may change. Please 24 | Page Revised August, 2021 contact the applicable licensing board(s) in the state where you may want to pursue licensure or certification before beginning an academic program to verify whether a program meets educational requirements for licensure or certification in the state .\" d. A student may be required to obtain an \" interim \" license in some states for 4th year placements. The student will work with the 4th year placement coordinator and with the 4th year site to pursue the appropriate licensure in this situation. e. It should be noted that a student may graduate from the AuD program yet need to return to the 4th year site in order to complete the site requirements. Once an AuD student graduates from the program, they are no longer considered a student and may be required to obtain a state license prior to completing the requirements. Students are encouraged to contact the licensure board of the state in which they are placed/are practicing to clarify requirements and follow the licensure requirements as needed. 4.5 - Clinical F ile Each stud ent who is pursuing the clinical education tract will have a clinical file. The clinical file are stored in Room 141 Pressey. A. Each AuD clinical folder will contain: a. Clinical Form (CF -25) (signed receipt of Code of Ethics) b. Audiology Clinical Requirements Checklist c. Code of Ethics Agreement d. Acknowledgement of Technical Standards e. Absenteeism Policy f. Immunization Records g. HIPAA Certificate of Completion h. CPR certificate (recommended) i. Universal Precautions certificate of completion j. Observation hours k. Any undergraduate patient /observation contact hours B. Students are required to access their clinic files for pre- term, midterm, and final conferences with preceptor s and for various other documentation activities, as described here. C. Docu mentation of health requirements for all students enrolled in the clinical track program in the Department of SHS: a. Provision of form for documenting completion of health requirements i. The Ohio State University student health center will provide the SLHC with an updated form with list of requirements annually in late Spring or Summer academic terms. These 25 | Page Revised August, 2021 forms will be included in the packet of information that is forwarded to incoming graduate students during the Summer prior to beginning the program. This allows for incoming students to begin documentation of health requirements and complete necessary immunizations, etc., with their personal physician. If students prefer to initiate the immunization process following enrollment at OSU, forms will be provide d during Orientation and students will be instructed to contact the Student Health Center or health provider of the student's choice. b. Filing of documentation i. Students are responsible for having documentation of completed health requirements in their graduate clinician folders. When the requirements are completed and the form is filed, the student is to report this to their assigned clinical advisor. 4.6 Knowledge of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) A. The OSU SLHC uses the \"Privacy Rule\", a provision of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which went into effect on April 14, 2003. a. HIPAA formalizes expectations for all health professionals to follow regarding patient rights and for safeguarding identifiable health information. More information on HIPAA can be found here: <https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for -professionals/privacy/index.html >. b. Specific questio ns or concerns regarding HIPAA compliance should be directed to the Clinic Director, who serves as the HIPAA privacy officer for the clinic. B. Graduate clinicians participating in clinical practicum in the OSU SLHC are trained in HIPAA Privacy regulations pr ior to beginning clinical practicum and will be expected to uphold privacy guidelines thereafter. a. The training will be offered via a BuckeyeLearn online module. b. After completing the BuckeyeLearn online module, the student must download the corresponding certificate and place it on file in their Graduate Clinician Folder or uploaded in Carmene . c. Practicum or externship sites may require that graduate clinicians participate in additional training or site -specific training prior to beginning their practicum pl acement. C. Graduate clinicians may also be required to participate in training in Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations, which apply primarily in public school and University settings. 4.7 - Documenting Clinical Hours* Students are responsible for maintaining ongoing records of the accrued clinical hours during each assigned rotation. SHS 6843 and 8943 students will use CF -46, for all assigned rotations. Preceptors will document all term accrued hours along with performance level on the CF -07 at the final conference each semester. Students may then transfer the approved hours to CF -05 (available on Excel; on the 6843; 8943 Carmen/Canvas site) so as to keep an e- copy of accrued clinical hours and record of attainment of clinical outcomes. SHS 6843; 8943 students will use CF -06 C to document the audiology hours accrued daily for each clinical rotation. At the end of each clinical rotation, the student will transfer these hours to a CF -06 where the preceptor will indicate competency level and sign off on these hours. 26 | Page Revised August, 2021 4.8 - Social Media Policy As the use of social media continues to evolve, it is vital that clinic personnel maintain confidentiality by following the strict HIPAA guidelines. Furthermore, social media generated comments are to be professional and discreet. Students are to use their best judgment in posting material that is neither inappropriate nor harmful and be aware of the effect that actions have one's o wn image . The following principles are to apply to use of social media: use disclaimers, respect copyright and trademark laws, maintain privacy of others, do not reveal confidential information, and promptly clarify statements that are misinterpreted. In addition, the use of social media should not interfere with the student's responsibility in the clinical service delivery interaction. S tudents are to refrain from using social media when in clinical rotations unless it directly relates to service delivery interaction. In addition, if an assigned clinical rotation program has and uses social media, students are to keep this site's related social media separate from their personal accounts. If a student encounters a situation in which a s ite's related social media threatens to be antagonistic, s/he should disengage from the dialogue in a polite manner and seek the advice of a preceptor. The OSU SLHC has zero tolerance policy on violations of the Social Media Policy. Violation will result in dismissal from the program. 5.0 - Clinical Advisors During the first academic term of enrollment at Ohio State, each AuD student is assigned a Clinical Advisor. The Clinical Advisor is different than the Academic Advisor. A Clinical Preceptor is responsible for the supervision of a particula r clinical assignment , therefore students will have several clinical preceptor s during the program (and possibly during a semester). The Clinical Advisor will be consistent throughout the program and only one Clinical Advisor will be assigned to the student . The Clinical Advisor's duties include : a. Advising the student as to the particular clinical experiences that are available through the Department of Speech and Hearing Science. b. Advising the student as to the ap propriate sequencing of practicum experiences in view of the student's academic background and previous clinical experience. c. Advising the student regarding the lock -step nature of the program and how their clinical experiences will progress based on acquisition of clinical skills. d. Approving t he clinical hours transferr ed from other training program(s). e. Approving the clinical hours and competencies at the time of graduation. 6.0 - The Ohio State University Speech -Language Hearing Clinic Procedures 6.1 - The Mission The OS U SLHC's mission is to improve the quality of life of all individuals with communication difficulties, to provide cost -effective services that meet the unique needs of the patient and their family, and to promote excellence in clinical training and education of future hearing -speech -language professionals. 27 | Page Revised August, 2021 6.2 - OSU SLHC Policies and Procedures A. Graduate clinicians who are assigned clinic in the OSU SLHC are responsible for perfor ming the following functions: a. Accessing the Counsel Ear electronic medical record system to view the clinic schedule, patient records and document services. b. Understanding the cost of services and conducting appropriate billing procedures. c. Conducting screenings, consultations, and evaluations as required. d. Choosing a clinic room that meets the client's needs. e. Informing the patient and/or family of the results of testing, treatment objectives, post -treatment progress, referrals, etc. f. Completin g all documentation associated with the patient's care, including diagnostic reports, shart notes (i.e., SOAP notes), and progress reports. g. Attending all required meetings with their assigned clinical preceptors. h. Recording patient contact hours to track p rogress toward graduation. 6.3 - Engaging in Evidence -Based, Supervised Clinical Practice A. During all clinical placements, graduate clinicians are expected to: a. Use resources provided in academic and clinical practicum classes and interactions with the preceptor in order to plan patient care. b. Turn in all clinical documentation on time and in the manner requested by each clinical preceptor. c. Implement preceptor feedback on all clinical practicum assignments. B. If unsure about instructions, graduate clinicians a re expected to review notes, emails, and ask questions of their clinical preceptors. C. Clinical preceptors are licensed professionals who are ultimately responsible for client care. Therefore, graduate clinicians should discuss all recommendations and treatment decisions with their clinical preceptors prior to taking action. D. If an OSU SLHC patient cancels a session, the graduate clinician is responsible for notifying the preceptor via the preceptor's preferred mode of communication (e.g., email or phone). 6.4 - Client Record Keeping/Filing Procedures A. Patient records may only be accessed by authorized clinical personnel (preceptors, graduate clinicians, office personnel, and/or faculty). a. Per HIPAA privacy rules, graduate clinicians should only access records belonging to their assigned patients. They should not access other records, whether out of curiosity or as a favor to another graduate clinician. b. Failure to comply will result in disciplinary measures. B. When consulting records in the OSU SLHC, gr aduate clinicians must: 28 | Page Revised August, 2021 a. Stay within specific areas of the clinic (129, 141a, 142, 146, 148, other appropriate rooms in the OSU SLHC) when working on client records, when possible. Client records may be accessed on the student's CounselEar account on their computer, however guidelines for confidentiality and HIPAA must be followed (e.g. not opening patient files in public places, such as a coffee shop or around people who are not authorized to have access to this information, such as roommates). . b. Never leave written client documents unattended. C. Clinicians must record each instance of contact with a patient (e.g., emails, phone call, text messages) in Counsel Ear as instructed by their clinical preceptor D. Printing, photocopying or photographing the con tents of client record is strictly prohibited unless a graduate clinician obtains the express approval of their clinical preceptor. If permission is given, all identifying information must be deleted from the photocopied report before the copy is removed from secured areas. E. Sharing electro nic copies of clinical documents that contain identifying information is also strictly prohibited unless explicitly instructed by the preceptor. F. The OSU SLHC has a zero tolerance policy on failure to safeguard client information. Violation will result in dismissal from the program. 6.5- Dress Code The OSU Speech -Language-Hearing Clinic established dress code guidelines that are designed to be inclusive and functional for student clinicians while promoting a safe and sanitary environment. The following gu idelines are to be implemented by graduate clinicians when observing or delivering clinical services in the OSU SLHC. A. Business casual attire: casual slacks/non -denim pants and skirts, collared shirts, blouses, sweaters, shirts with sleeves that cover midriff, free of holes, tears, and other significant signs of wear B. Name tag/badge C. Closed toed shoes Clinic experiences that are coordinated through the Department of Speech and Hearing Science (e.g. Hilltop, Aphasia Initiative, Golf Camp etc.) may require specific attire due to weather and/or physical requirements of the setting (i.e. shorts, casual t -shirts, etc.). The clinical preceptor of that experience will provide dress code requirement modific ations, as appropriate. Tattoos and facial piercings may be requested to be covered and/or removed if they interfere with the delivery of clinical services and is up to the discretion of the clinical preceptor (i.e. tattoos that are distracting to the pati ent or a piercing that interferes with modeling of speech sounds or for the person to understand the speech of the clinician). Please consult your clinical preceptor for any questions you have regarding the dress code requirements for your assigned clinica l experience. External placement will have their own dress code requirements that may include specific attire (i.e. scrubs, limiting choice of hair color/style, tattoos, and piercings). 6.6 - Guidelines for Communicating about Clients in the OSU SLHC 29 | Page Revised August, 2021 A. Graduate clinicians should only discuss patients with clinical preceptors or other professional staff. Conversations should be limited to speech, language, and/or hearing problems (or related matters). B. Conferences between preceptors, graduate clinicians, patients , and/or family should be conducted in clinic rooms. a. Individual clients/cases should not be discussed in hallways, Room 35, or the Clinic office area (i.e., Rooms 139 and 141). b. Graduate clinicians are advised to be discreet when discussing patients , as anyone has access to treatment and diagnostic rooms by way of closed circuit TV and one way mirrors with sound systems. C. Patients are not to be discussed with individuals who are not part of the clinic staff, including other professionals, without written permission from the patient and/or their family. This includes phone calls, emails, and personal meetings, as well as written reports and correspondence. D. If it is necessary to obtain additional information from other agencies or professionals in order to provide optimal client care, graduate clinicians must discuss these procedures with their clinical preceptor prior to raising the issue with patients /caregivers/other professionals. Once a plan of action has been determined, the graduate clinician is respo nsible for initiating and following through. This may involve scheduling conferences, e -communication, telephone contacts, letters, and so on. 6.7 - Maintaining Open Lines of Communication A. Graduate clinicians should use surnames and appropriate titles (Prof., Dr., Ms., Mrs., Mr., etc.) when addressing clinical faculty and staff, patients, and parents of patients (unless an individual requests otherwise). B. Graduate clinicians are expected to r espond in a timely manner to email, phone calls, and other means of communication with patients , caregivers, clinical preceptors, and clinical advisors. C. If extenuating circumstances arise that may interfere with the completion of any aspect of the program, graduate clinicians must inform their clinical advisors and/or OSU SLHC Placement Coordinators as soon as possible. D. Students are likewise encouraged to inform the OSU SLHC Placement Coordinators regarding any issues or concerns at outside clinical practi cum sites. E. When seeking either verbal statements or written letters of recommendation from faculty members or clinical preceptors, graduate clinicians are required to provide the form \"Authorization and/or Waiver for Letter or Statement of Recommendation. http://registrar.osu.edu/policies/ferpa_authorization_release_information.pdf > to the person(s) providing the recommendation. a. This is a requirement of The Ohi o State University and was put in place to protect student confidentiality. 6.8 - Absenteeism 30 | Page Revised August, 2021 A. Clinician Absences a. Emergency/Illness i. In case of an emergency or illness, please notify the assigned preceptor immediately. ii. If the student is assigned to an outside site, notify bot h the affiliated site preceptor and the appropriate A uD OSU SLHC Audiology Practicum Coordinator of the absence need. b. Planned Absences and Extenuating Circumstances i. Should an extenuating circumstance (e.g., professional conference, academic commitment, job interview, etc.) arise that necessitates an arranged absence from a clinical placement, a letter of petition must be submitted to the OSU SLHC Audiology Coordinator for consideration and approval by the Clinical Committee. ii. A template of this letter is posted on Carmen/Canvas for your reference and must include options for making up missed clinical time. iii. This letter should be submitted as soon as the event is known (even if 1- 2 semesters prior) so that advanced notice to the preceptor (s) can occur upon approval of the petition. iv. When this event is known, and petition letter, is submitted, the student should not discuss the event/petition with the outside site preceptor until approval is provided from the coordinator. v. The absence will only be a pproved once the site preceptor has given permission of the absence plan as delineated in the letter. vi. This is a professional program with the expectation that students will be available full time for the duration of the program (11- 12 semesters in the AuD program). vii. These types of requests should be minimal and only proposed in special circumstances. viii. Consideration for ap proval depends on such criteria as educational versus recreational activities and once in a lifetime events versus regularly scheduled events. ix. The academic calendar affords \"time off, \" such as semester breaks. Students should plan to use this time for events, such as family vacations, weddings, etc. whenever possible. B. Patient Absences a. If an OSU SLHC patient cancels their appointment, select th \"cancelled\" category in CounselEar. b. If a patient fails to attend appointments on a regular basis , the graduate clinician is responsible for letting the preceptor know and it is likely that the patient will not be rescheduled. 6.5 - Emergency Procedures, Evacuation Plan, and Crime Prevention A. Fire Alarm or Drill - Clinicians are responsible for their patients during this emergency situation. The following plan should be executed in case of an emergency situation in the OSU SLHC a. All occupants in clinical rooms on the first floor should proceed to the north lobby and exit the building. All clinicians an d patien ts on the lower level should proceed to the north staircase and take that to the emergency exit on the north side of the building. b. The person discovering the emergency or the reason to evacuate the building should activate the fire alarm located on the sou theast corner of Pressey Hall between rooms 110 and 110a of the first floor or in the east hall at the southeast corner of the lower level. At the sound of the alarm, the above plan will immediately go into action, whereby the building will be evacuated as quickly and orderly as possible. However, the person discovering the emergency should, if time 31 | Page Revised August, 2021 allows, call the Emergency Number, 911, and quickly and clearly explain the emergency. If unable to call due to a serious emergency, proceed out of the building and place the call from the nearest available phone. c. Graduate Clinicians a re responsible for their patients during an emergency situation. The graduate clinici an should accompany their patient calmly and quickly to the north exit of the building. They are to meet the parent and/or the pe rson who accompanied the patient outside the building directly out the door of the north exit. Preceptor s are responsible for verifying that specific rooms have been cleared as follows: i. The preceptor /staff member in Room 115 is responsible for checking and assisting those in Room 120 and the 124 suite. ii. The preceptor /staff member in Room 119 is responsible for checking and assisting those in the 126 and 130 suites. iii. The preceptor /staff member in Room 123 is responsible for checking and assisting those in Room 129 and the 140 suite and providing a backup for those leaving the parent observation rooms and clinic waiting area. iv. The preceptor /staff member in Room 145 is responsible for assuring that the parents/accompanying a dults in the observation rooms and clini c waiting areas are taken to the north exit of the building and remain with them until th ey are connected with the patient that they have accompanied to the clinic. This is vital to the smooth, calm evacuation of the clinic. Any available student clinicians and all staff in the clinic office area should assist with this task. v. The preceptor /staff member in Room 147b is responsible for checking and assisting those in the Audiology Suites (147 suite) and also providing a backup for those leaving the parent observation rooms and clinic waiting area. d. If the patient is non- ambulatory and on the lower level of the OSU SLHC in Pressey Hall , they should be taken to the north stairwell outside the fire doors. The clinician should then exit the building and notify the fireman and/or policeman upon their arrival of the location of the patient . e. Fire extinguishers and hoses are located on: i. 1 st Floor i. Southeast corner between rooms 110 and 110a ii. Hallway between suites 126 and 130 iii. Northwest wall across from 139 (waiting room) ii. Lower Level i. North stairwell ii. North wall across from room 23 iii. Southeast corner iv. Southwest corner around the corner from room 1 v. South stair well f. Use of elevator is to be avoided. B. Tornado Warning - Clinicians a re responsible for their patients during this emergency situation. The clinician shou ld quickly accompany the patient to the waiting room and, if possible, find the parents and/or person who may have accompanied the patient and then all can take appropriate action of moving to the lower level hall in Pressey by way of the north staircase. It is suggested that the patient, their family, and clinician remain in the lower level hall until the danger period has passed. C. Medical Emergencies ( Urgent and emergent situations ) - If a patient has an emergency situation, 32 | Page Revised August, 2021 time is of the essence and assessing the situation accurately a nd effectively is critical. Clinicians a re responsible for their patient during this emergency situation. a. Medical Emergencies (i.e., is unconscious, reports chest pain, has profuse bleeding, etc.), the following protocol should be followed: i. Do not leave the person alone ii. Ask the Clinic Offic e Manager or clinical preceptor to call 9 -1-1 and to get you support for first aid (i.e. assistance with CPR, bring a First Aid kit, obtain the AED from the basement outside of Room 99 or on the main floor in the cabinet by the women's restroom near the main Department office ) until professional help arrives iii. Initiate CPR or use the AED , as appropriate iv. The Clinic First Aid kits are located in the clinic office (cabinet above GA desk), in room 129, and in 147e in audiology area b. In the case of an emergent situation (i.e. patient trips in the parking lot, has difficulty gett ing up from a chair without assistance, seems disoriented but indicates that they do not want assistance), the following protocol should be followed: i. Provide assistance r equested by the patient after the situation is evaluated . If the person has tripped and needs help up, for example, provide a ssistance to the patient as deemed safe. The \"Good Samaritan\" laws pr ovide protection in this area , particularly when the person is requesting assistance and directing their wishes in this situation. ii. Provide basic first aid (e.g. band aid for a cut, etc.) from first aid kits located in the clinic office in the cabinet above the GA desk, in room 129, or i n room 147e. iii. Ask about current or chronic health conditions (i.e. diabetes, seizure disorder, etc.) to help assess the situation and to report to healthcare providers, family, and/or Public Safety, as necessary. iv. If there is concern abo ut releasing the patient from the clinic (e.g. person seems disoriented but does not want 9- 1-1 to be called), ask the Clinic Offic e manager or clinical preceptor to contact OSU Department of Public Safety (614- 292-2121). The Department of Public Safety should be able to asse ss the situation, either by phone or by sending Public Service personnel to provide a \"safety check.\" The \"safety check\" assesses the person's level of safety (somewhat like a sobriety check) and OSU personnel are trained in this area. They will be the ult imate decision maker regarding the person's ability to leave campus safe ly and on their own accord. D. Crime Prevention a. Preventing Theft: Theft is the greatest security problem on campus. The following steps will help to prevent theft. i. Never leave personal belongings (books, purses, jackets, electronics) unattended. Reserve a student locker, ask a friend to watch them, or take them with you. Remember: the AuD grad room /lounge is often unoccupied and anyone can walk in. ii. Be alert to unfamiliar p ersons loitering or wandering in the Speech and Hearing area. Ask if you can be of help. If they are patients , direct them to the clinic office. If not, it is a good way to let them know you are aware of their presence. Get in the habit of noticing appearance and dress of unfamiliar persons. iii. Clinic equipment, tests, and materials are expensive. Be sure to return them to their proper places after use. Report missing items to a preceptor or the Clinic Office Manager immediately. 33 | Page Revised August, 2021 iv. If a theft does occur, report it to a faculty or staff member and call Campus Police (2 - 2121) immediately. b. Personal Safety i. If a student will be in the Speech and Hearing Science area after 5:00 p.m., they should let someone know where they will be and their plans. Relock doors upon entry into a clinical area. Do not let others in the building through locked doors when exiting the building. ii. Do not walk alone at night. Call a friend or the campus escort service (2 - 2101). Avoid shortcuts and poorly lighted areas. Keep a grip on your belongings and walk purposefully. Be ready to run and scream if necessary. iii. Cars should always be locked with windows closed. Do not leave valuable items in view. If at all possible, park in a well -lighted area. Have key(s) ready to unlock and relock the doors. They can also be used as a weapon , if needed . iv. If in need of emergency help, use an Emergency Help Phone, located around campus, or call 911 on any other phone (for city -wide emergency services). 6.6 - OSU SLHC Guidelines A. Observation Participation : Only those who have formal affiliation (students, faculty, staff of the Ohio State University Speech and Hearing Science Program, patient s' spouses, parents, and/or legal guardians, and persons under the direct auspices of the C linic Director) may observe clinical sessions. B. Observation Restrictions: Those observing may observe a patient only upon receiving permission from the patient 's clinical preceptor . Each patient and/or legal guardian is informed that observation of session s may be taking place. Furthermore, the patient has the right to request that the observations be restricted to specific persons. C. If you are to be observing in audiology, report to the 147 suites in order to determine where you will be observing. All information about the patient and clinician is confidential. Therefore: i. Keep observation doors closed. ii. No comments should be made about either person ( patient or clinician) outside observation areas or preceptor 's offices. iii. When referring to patients in reports, use the person's initials. Never use the patient 's full name. iv. All HIPAA guidelines apply to observations. D. Guidelines for Professional Clinical Behavior a. Clinic cases should only be discussed with clinical preceptor s or other professional staff. Conversations should concern themselves with matters relevant to the speech, language and/or hearing problem or related matters. b. Conferences between preceptor s and student s should be conducted in designated areas, such as the preceptor's office ( Be discrete related to this.) c. Cases should not be discussed in hallways, room 35 or the Clinic office area, rooms 139 and 141 Pressey. d. Parent conferences should be conducted in trea tment /clinic rooms. 34 | Page Revised August, 2021 e. No information concerning patients is to be discussed with individuals who are not part of the clinic staff, including other professionals, without written permission from the patient or the patient' s parents. This includes phone calls, e -communication, and personal meetings as well as wri tten reports and correspondence. f. If more information is needed from other agencies or professionals to achieve a patient's goals, discuss the strategies and procedures with the clinical preceptor prior to discussing issues with the patient /parents and/or o ther professionals. Once the procedures have been discussed, the graduate clinician will have the responsibility to initiate and follow through on the decided action. (This may include scheduling conferences, e -communication, telephone contacts, letters, etc.). g. Do not walk through the waiting/reception room (139) as a path to the clinic areas. Instead, take the north hallway (past rooms 134 -138). E. Forms/Materials a. Clinic F orms (CF) are known by their number (i.e. CF -02, CF -05) than the title of the form. Whenever possible, preceptors will try to use both the number and description/title of the form. b. Graduate clinicians are responsible for knowing the forms to accurately complete patient care. A list of these forms is also available in the form cabinet in the Clinic Office. c. Instruction on the clinic forms occurs in meeting with the preceptor , class sessions, and can be found on Carmen/Canvas. d. Forms that are used for clinical matters are kept in a file cabinet directly adjacent to the preceptor mailboxes in the Clinic Office. The users of the forms are requested to take the blue sheet to the Clinic Office Manager when it is reached and only a few forms remain. Do not take the last form; instead , inform the Clinic Office Manager, so the supply can be replenished. F. Clinical (practicum) Hours Documentation a. SHS Clinical Clock Hours --CF -06 and CF -07 are very important , as they are where clinical hours are recorded. b. Each clinician shall have two copies of each appropriate form --one is to be kept in the student file housed in 140 Pressey , and updated at the end of each academic term. The other copy is to be housed student's \"home\" personal folder (preferably scanned fo r retention) for safekeeping , updated at least at the end of each semester. c. Graduate clinicians are responsible for having the preceptor complete and sign the forms for each academic term they are engaged in practicum. d. SHS 6843 Clinical hours are counted and recorded on the CF -07/08 in which the graduate student has direct contact with the patient in assessment, management, treatment, and/or counseling. e. For AuD students: SHS 6843 Clinical hours are counted and recorded on the CF -06. Clinical practicum is defined as direct patient/ patient contact, consultation, record keeping, and administrative duties relevant to audiology service delivery. The minimum number of hours of supervised clinical practicum is 1,820. f. Graduate students will keep an ongoing record of their clinical hours for each day that they are in their practicum. This documentation will then be reviewed and compared to the documentation that the preceptor has maintained during the assigned academic term. 35 | Page Revised August, 2021 Graduate students are to discuss the format of recording and documenting hours with the assigned preceptor at the beginning of assigned term. g. Log of Recommended Clinical Experience for SHS 6843 students --04 and 05 forms provide a summary of the recommended clinical experience that each student should have while in professional training. It is important that this log be updated on a term -to-term basis. Copies of this form should be scanned at the end of each semester and the graduate clinician should place a copy in their clinical folder and maintain at least one electronic copy on their personal computer. G. Calibration of Audiometers a. Daily Calibra tion of Clinical Audiometers i. A biological check must be performed on the day that an audiometer will be used. The biological check will include checks of thresholds for all pure tones through earphones, attenuator linearity, electronic crosstalk, bone vibr ator output, cords, and speaker function. Forms for the checks are posted in each test booth. b. Daily Calibration of Screening Audiometers i. Each screening audiometer will receive a biological check before any period of use. The biological check will include checks of thresholds for all pure tones, attenuator linearity, electronic crosstalk, and cords. The person who will be using the audiomete r will perform each check . c. Request permission from the Clinic Director to check out equipment. d. A variety of equipment is available for students, faculty and staff. The equipment and space must be scheduled with ample time for instrumentation and due consi deration for others who have similar needs. For specific needs: i. Suite147 for hearing equipment and materials, including audiometers and Immittance screener ii. Room128 and 129 for treatment equipment and materials iii. Room143 for assessment materials iv. Room129: clinical reference library e. Any missing or damaged materials and malfunctioning equipment should be reported immediately to the Clinic Director. H. Clinical Research Requiring Ohio State Clinical Facility, Equipment, and Materials a. Policy: Faculty, staff, and students using the SLHC facility, equipment, and/or materials while conducting research are to coordinate their needs and plans with the Clinic Director. The researcher will purchase expendable materials. b. Procedure: The researcher is to discuss facility, equipment, and material needs with the appropriate coordinator. After a satisfactory schedule is approved, the investigator is to submit a written outline of facility, equipment and material needs along with dates and times of planned usage. I. Infection Control a. Purpose: This program is established to provide a coordinated program of education, Universal Precautions, and exposure follow -up to minimize or eliminate workplace exposure 36 | Page Revised August, 2021 to Hepatitis B, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and other diseases. The program's purpose is to ensure and maintain the Speech -Language -Hearing Clinic's commitment to a safe and healthful environment for its staff, students, and patient s and to ensure compliance with OSHA's standard on occupational exposure to blood borne pathogens (29 CFR 1910.1030). b. Scope: This plan applies to all occupational exposures to blood or other potentially infectious materials within the facilities of the OSU Speech -Language -Hearing Clinic. c. Definitions i. Staff: Employed by The Ohio State University and working in the OSU SLHC. ii. Students: All students providing services in the OSU SL HC. iii. Patient s: All persons receiving services in the OSU SLHC. d. Policy i. Clinic staff and students are to implement infection control procedures as appropriate to meet requirements of OSHA's standard on occupational exposure to blood borne pathogens (29 CFR 1910.1030). ii. Staff and students will also implement the general sanitation guidelines as outlined to reduce risk of other infectious diseases. e. Procedures - Including, but not lim ited to: i. Handwashing 1. Before and after each patient contact, after contacting blood or body fluids, after using the toilet or helping a child with toileting, after a child sneezes, coughing or wiping a nose, before preparing, serving, or eating goods, after handling soiled items such as used tissues or dirty toys, after diapering, immediately after removing gloves or other personal protective equipment, and before and after smoking. 2. Handwashing is the single most important means of preventing the spread of infection and should be performed using the following steps: Obtain a dequate supply of paper towel for drying hands from the dispenser before washing hands. Turn on the water and adjust the flow so that it does not splash the surrounding area. Apply soap to wrists, backs of hands, palms, and fingers. Rub all surfaces of hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds, including the areas between fingers. Clean under each nail using the nails of the other hand. Rinse hands thoroughly under a stream of water. Leave the water running while patting the hands dry with a paper towel. Finally, turn off the w ater using the paper towel. 3. NOTE: Antibacterial hand sanitizer (i.e. without water needed) can be found in each clinic room; this can be utilized in cases when a thorough hand- washing procedure is not possible. ii. Gloves 1. Wear examination gloves while performi ng procedures that may involve exposure to blood or body fluids. Gloves are provided throughout the clinical areas. 2. Gloves should also be worn when cleaning spills involving blood or other body fluids 3. Change gloves between patient s and when the gloves bec ome soiled to minimize the potential for spreading infection. 4. Dispose of gloves in the trashcan in the service delivery room. 5. Wash hands or use antibacterial hand sanitizer immediately after disposing of 37 | Page Revised August, 2021 gloves. 6. Do not wash or disinfect sterile examinati on gloves for reuse. iii. Earphones, earbuds, headsets, and probe tubes, etc. are to be cleaned with a 10% bleach solution and/or disinfecting wipes following each use. iv. Reusable items such as otoscopic specula (both handheld and video otoscope), immittance tips, ear light tips, and stock earmolds are to be cleaned with the 10% bleach solution mixed each day in clinic. Consult with the supervising audiologist with questions . v. General Sanitation 1. To disinfect a surface wash it with soap and water first, then apply a disinfectant. The disinfectant will not work as effe ctively if the surface has not been washed. Clorox Anywhere spray/wipes are provided for disinfecting surfaces. 2. Mouthed or soiled toys/dishes: wash with soap and water, clean with Clorox Anywhere spray/wipes, air dry. 3. Environmental spills of blood (e.g., nosebleeds, vomitus, feces, or other body fluids) a. While wearing gloves, wipe up with a disposable towel, wash objects coming in contact with the fluid with soap and water and clean with Clorox Anywhere spray/wipes. b. Dispose of the gloves in one of the waste containers that is specifically contained until daily trash removal is available. c. For nosebleeds or injuries that result in bleeding, the person assisting should wear vinyl gloves whenever possible. d. Wash hands or use antibacterial hand sanitizer immedia tely after disposal of gloves. 4. Food and drink will not be kept in or on refrigerators, freezers, shelves, or countertops where blood or other potentially infectious materials are present. 5. Staff members and students will only eat and drink in the appropriate eating areas to prevent migration of contamination beyond the work area. 6. Staff members and students will only apply make -up, handle contact lenses, or perform other grooming in appropriate Department restrooms to prevent contamination beyond the work are a. f. Management of Communicable Diseases i. The \"Ohio Department of Human Services Communicable Disease Chart\" is housed in room 129 in a notebook labeled \"Communicable Diseases.\" ii. Each patient is to be observed daily with regards to evidencing symptoms of a communicable disease as he or she enters a session or the preschool group. iii. Should suspected symptoms be observed, the patient 's preceptor should be immediately informed and appropriate action is to be taken as needed. iv. A patient with rashes, a sore throat, an elevated temperature, vomiting, or evidence or lice, scabies, parasitic infestation or a communicable disease will be isolated from other patient s immediately. The patient will then be advised to leave the facility quickly a s possible so to minimize other's exposure. g. Post Exposure Plan i. In the rare event that a staff member or student experiences an exposure to blood, blood products, or other potentially infectious body fluids by way of contact with broken skin, mucous membrane, eye, or other identified exposure, the following 38 | Page Revised August, 2021 procedures will occur: 1. The exposed staff member or student will immediately take appropriate first aid actions (if feasible), including but not limited to washing the affected area with soap and water and /or flushing the mucous membranes or eye (Eyes must be flushed for a minimum of 15 minutes). The staff member or student will then immediately report the incident to his or her immediate preceptor or another preceptor if that person is not available. 2. The s taff member or student will receive necessary immediate first aid and will be referred for medical treatment, which may include gamma globulin and/or Hepatitis B vaccine. The medical facility will be informed of all known information about the exposure inc ident, including but not limited to: type and site of the exposure route and all known information relating to the incident; HBV and HIV antibody status of the source person, if known; Hepatitis B vaccination status of the person experiencing the exposure, a copy of the Speech- Language -Hearing Clinic's Infection Control Plan; first aid given to the exposed person, any known medical information pertaining to the occupationally exposed person which the medical provider might find helpful in rendering treatme nt. 3. With signed authorization (consent) by the person exposed, a baseline will be obtained on his or her blood for HBV and HIV current status, with emphasis on the maintenance of all confidentiality issues. 4. Staff members and students have 90 days following the baseline blood collections to decide if they wish to have HIV serological testing done. Therefore, the employer must make provisions with the medical provider to hold a sample of blood from the occupationally exposed person for a minimum of 90 days. 5. The person sustaining the exposure will complete the first portion of an \"Accident Report\" form, paying attention to completing the form in detail, identifying the source individual or other source (if feasible), then signing and dating the form. The comple ted form will then be given to the preceptor . Accident Report forms can be found at www.biosci.ohio - state.edu/safety/Accident.html . 6. The preceptor who has been notified of the exposure will then complete the second portion of the Accident Report form, paying attention to identifying the type and route of the exposure; identifying the source of exposure or the unfeasibility of identifying the source ; documenting the HBV and/or HIV antibody status of the source individual, if known; documenting the circumstances and cause of the exposure, including conditions and actions related to the incident; identifying engineering and work practice controls utilized or not utilized; identifying personal protective equipment utilized or not utilized; identifying actions by other staff members and/or students that may have contributed to the incident; identifying the immediate action taken (if applicable); describin g actions that will be taken to prevent this type of exposure in the future, including retraining if necessary; initiating any disciplinary action if appropriate; and signing and dating the Accident Report form. 7. The exposed staff member is responsible for submitting the Accident Report form to Employee Health Services University Hospital Clinics 2A 456 W. 39 | Page Revised August, 2021 10th Ave. (293- 8146) within four (4) days of the exposure. Typically, treatment must be initiated prior to the seventh day following exposure in order to be viable. 8. The exposed staff member is responsible for submitting the Accident Report form to Employee Health Services University Hospital Clinics 2A 456 W. 10th Ave. (293- 8146) within four (4) days of the exposure. Typically, treatment must be initiated prior to the seventh day following exposure in order to be viable. 9. If the source individual can be determined, the HBV and HIV status is unknown, and consent is obtained from either the source individual or legally authorized representative, coll ection and testing of the source individual's blood to determine presence of HIV or HBV infection will be done. Results of the laboratory test of HBV and HIV status must be kept confidential and shared only on a strict \"need to know\" basis . 10. Every effort sh ould be made to detain the source individual in the facility on the day of the exposure in order to discuss the exposure incident and obtain consent for blood testing. The source individual should arrange to be tested by the physician of choice. The physic ian and the physician testing the exposed individual should consult with one another to determine the type and extent of testing. Costs of testing for the source individual will typically be borne by the source individual. 11. If consent is not obtained, this fact must be documented in writing, with the date and time noted and signed by the individual preceptor seeking the consent. An explanation of the unfeasibility or inability to obtain the consent must be documented, as well. When the source individual's c onsent is not required by law, the source individual's blood, if available, will be tested and the results documented. Results of the source individual's testing will be made available to the exposed staff member or student, and that person will be informe d of applicable laws and regulations concerning disclosure and confidentiality of the identity and infectious status of the source individual. ii.

Externships (American Academy of Audiology, 2006) Introduction With a growing number of fourth year externs needing placements in their final year, many clinical programs across the nation are receiving year -round inquiries from universities and students. At the request of clinical program directors and in an effort to bring greater uniformity to the application and selection process, the following timeline was suggested by the Academy's Clinical Education Subcommittee in 2006. The timeline will not be ideally suited for every university and every clinical setting; however, movement toward greater uniformity in application and placement should result in a more timely and efficient process, beneficial to st udents, university programs and clinical sites. Externship Timeline Student/Faculty Search Process: Students/faculty investigate program opportunities, requirements, deadlines; July through October Application Period Open: Extern sites accept applications during this time period; September and October Application Submitted: Final date for sites accepting applications; October 31 Applications Files Completed: Letters and transcripts to be on file; November 15 Interviews: Externship interviews scheduled and completed; December and January Offers Made: Offers made by sites to students on February 1 Accepted Round 1: Offers accepted by students within 2 weeks Follow -up Offers Completed: Process completed by March 31 Externship begins: June 1 - July 1 44 | Page Revised August, 2021 Appendix C Optional Certification Plan for Au.D.
