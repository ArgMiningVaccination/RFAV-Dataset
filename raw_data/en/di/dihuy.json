To function well, the immune system needs balance and harmony. Ayurveda is replete with practices that help you live a well-balanced life and improve the body's natural defence mechanism. To know more about the practices that help to boost the health of your immune system, read on - 1. Eat a diet high in fruits and vegetables: Eat fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains to keep your immune system strong and healthy. A diet that is not nutritionally balanced will weaken the immunity. Add spices like cardamom, ginger, cumin, turmeric and cinnamon to your meals. To get the maximum nourishment from your food, chew it slowly and properly. When you eat mindfully you not only enjoy the food, but you also resist the urge to overeat. Try to eat your meals in a relaxed manner. To avoid indigestion, eat two hours before sleeping. 2. Get proper sleep: A good night's sleep not only rejuvenates your mind but it also boosts your immunity. When you sleep, your immune system releases proteins called cytokines. Certain cytokines protect your immune system by helping it to fight inflammation. Long-term sleep deprivation decreases production of cytokines and infection-fighting antibodies and cells. 3. Stay active: Regularly exercising is a powerful way to boost your immune system. It not only helps you feel more energetic but also makes the antibodies and white blood cells in your body circulate more rapidly. A report published in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine suggests that yoga can reduce inflammation in the body and help in strengthening the immune system.
