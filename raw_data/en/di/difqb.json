Yesterday, PubPeer [won a near-complete victory](http://retractionwatch.com/2015/03/05/judge-rules-most-of-pubpeers-commenters-can-remain-anonymous/) in a case seeking the identities of their commenters. And also yesterday, a Massachusetts judge struck down \u2014 for the second time \u2014 a [request by Mario Saad to remove expressions of concern about four of his papers in Diabetes](http://retractionwatch.com/2015/03/05/researcher-asks-court-to-overturn-motion-denying-his-request-to-quash-expressions-of-concern/). In his [ruling](http://ia902709.us.archive.org/17/items/gov.uscourts.mad.167340/gov.uscourts.mad.167340.17.0.pdf), Judge Timothy Hillman wrote: [Continue reading Researcher loses second bid to quash Diabetes expressions of concern](https://retractionwatch.com/2015/03/06/researcher-loses-second-bid-to-quash-diabetes-expressions-of-concern/#more-26431) Stapel](http://retractionwatch.com/category/diederik-stapel/). Psychology has been home to some of the most infamous cases of fraud in recent years, and while it's just a few bad apples who are spoiling the bunch, the field itself has seen an overall increase in retractions, according to a new paper by [J\u00fcrgen Margraf](http://www.kli.psy.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/klipsy/team/en/klipsy-en-prof.dr.j.margraf.html) appearing in [Psychologische](http://psycontent.metapress.com/content/120238/) [ Rundschau](http://psycontent.metapress.com/content/120238/) and titled \" [Zur Lage der Psychologie](http://psycontent.metapress.com/content/c1147l50700253p4/).\" That increase, Margraf found, is not entirely due to its most well-known fraudsters. Here's the relevant figure: since 1989: study](https://retractionwatch.com/2015/03/05/psychology-retractions-have-quadrupled-since-1989-study/#more-26241) [Diabetes researcher won't give up court fight to expressions of concern](https://retractionwatch.com/2015/03/05/researcher-asks-court-to-overturn-motion-denying-his-request-to-quash-expressions-of-concern/) Apparently, you can't keep [Mario Saad](http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-author/mario-saad/) down. The researcher, who had [12 figures in a paper corrected this week](http://retractionwatch.com/2015/03/04/plos-one-mega-correction-but-no-retraction-for-researcher-who-sued-diabetes-journal/), was dealt a setback last week when a judge [denied his motion to remove expressions of concern on four of his papers in the journal Diabetes, ](http://retractionwatch.com/2015/02/25/judge-denies-motion-by-researcher-to-quash-diabetes-expressions-of-concern/)saying that would have amounted to prior restraint \u2014 essentially, censorship (a no-no, thanks to the First Amendment). Saad and his attorneys, however, were undeterred. They filed a [motion for reconsideration](https://www.popehat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SaadReconsideration.pdf) just four days later, [along with a brief](https://www.popehat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SaadMPA.pdf), arguing: [Continue reading Diabetes researcher won't give up court fight to quash expressions of concern](https://retractionwatch.com/2015/03/05/researcher-asks-court-to-overturn-motion-denying-his-request-to-quash-expressions-of-concern/#more-26372) [Weekend reads: P values banned, climate skeptic fails to disclose corporate funding, editors behaving badly](https://retractionwatch.com/2015/02/28/weekend-reads-p-values-banned-climate-skeptic-fails-to-disclose-corporate-funding-editors-behaving-badly/) [This week at Retraction Watch featured a ](https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/books.jpg) [change of heart by a journal](http://retractionwatch.com/2015/02/23/journal-takes-citation-manipulation-suggestion-off-author-info-page/), and a look at Nature's [addition of double-blind peer Here's what was happening [Continue reading Weekend reads: P values banned, climate skeptic fails to disclose corporate funding, editors behaving badly](https://retractionwatch.com/2015/02/28/weekend-reads-p-values-banned-climate-skeptic-fails-to-disclose-corporate-funding-editors-behaving-badly/#more-26056) [PubPeer Selections: Odd citations, \"practice makes geneticist David Latchman's group notches second retraction](https://retractionwatch.com/2015/02/27/prominent-geneticist-david-latchmans-group-notches-second-retraction/) [A team of researchers whose work is under investigation by University College London has retracted a second paper.](https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/j-cell-science.gif) Three of the 11 authors of the 2005 Journal of Cell Science paper being retracted \u2014 [David Latchman](http://www.london.ac.uk/3356.html), Richard Knight, and [Anastasis Stephanou](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=ASTEP38) \u2014 were authors of a [Journal of Biological Chemistry paper retracted in January](http://retractionwatch.com/2015/01/20/prominent-geneticist-nets-retraction-two-corrections-lot-questions/).

But the red-hot field of [stem cell research](http://retractionwatch.com/?s=%22stem+cell%22) is another that makes frequent appearances, last year's [STAP controversy](http://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/02/stap-stem-cell-papers-officially-retracted-as-nature-argues-peer-review-couldnt-have-detected-fatal-problems/) being particularly prominent.
