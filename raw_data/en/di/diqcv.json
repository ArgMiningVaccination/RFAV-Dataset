The anthroposophic medical approach originated through the work of Dr Rudolf Steiner (PhD) and Dr Ita Wegman (MD) at the beginning of the 20th Century in Switzerland and Germany. At present anthroposophic medicine is practiced extensively throughout Europe and in more than 65 countries around the world. The aim of anthroposophic medicine is to encourage a patient's personal responsibility and self-development in health and illness. Disease is seen as an imbalance between and among functions and forces; and healing as the restoration of the physiological powers of integration. Anthroposophic doctors regard physical and mental existence together with the human spirit as a unit, each element having the capacity to influence the others. Anthroposophic medicine therefore aims to form a picture of the physical, psychological, and personal soul circumstances that have paved the way for an illness to take hold. Guided by scientific findings, evidence based research, personal empirical knowledge, and disciplined intuition, the anthroposophic physician combines current science with individualised wisdom to formulate personalised treatment for each unique patient. Anthroposophic medicines are therefore often prescribed to stimulate and restore the balance of bodily functions whilst strengthening the forces of individualization and autonomy in the organism. In this way they complement conventional medication. Where conventional medicine concentrates on destroying the agents of disease, suppressing associated processes and replacing missing substances, anthroposophic medicine, wherever possible, aims to enable the human organism to overcome a disease through its own innate healing capacity. The right medicines play a major role in this process and where appropriate, the anthroposophic physician may also conscientiously help the patient to consider his/her own individual illness in the context of his/her biography. For the anthroposophic doctor consideration of a patient's individual biology & biography is regarded of prime importance in order to facilitate a process of personal transformation, which is the more general purpose of the medical art and may be the true meaning of illness.
