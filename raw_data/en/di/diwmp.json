Additional courses may be recommended. Always check programs' websites before applying as their prerequisites may have been updated without us knowing. Units shown are quarter units. Some requirements shown are estimated equivalents to semester units. If a school appears to have no requirements, then that school's admissions requirements are based on competencies, not courses.
