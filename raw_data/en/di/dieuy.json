I keep them at home, my car and at my desk at work. I use these and take these everywhere I go, every single day. The lavender scent is so amazing and refreshing. It also keeps me conscious of keeping my phone clean. Much better cleaning with organic lavender wipes than ones with rubbing alcohol. I love the smell of these wipes. They are AMAZING!!! They also help me keep my phone germ free and the customer service was great. This is a great idea. Gave some to my kids too.
