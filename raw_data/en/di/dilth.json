Aromatherapy is a highly effective treatment for a depleted or suppressed immune system because we can employ essential oils that have been proven to boost the immune system. Essential Oils that are **IMMUNE BOOSTERS** - Tea Tree, Lavender, Geranium, Rosemary Using essential oils to treat a depleted immune system can be a very positive treatment - especially when used regularly. Research has shown that essential oils work as natural immune boosters in three different modes of action: 1) They work directly against the invading bacteria and viruses due to their powerful antibacterial and antiviral actions. 2) Certain essential oils can influence the stimulation and production of phagocytes, T- cells and B- cells which are so vital to your body's defences. 3) Other essential oils can give an uplifting boost to the emotional system, which helps break the downward spiral caused by immunodeficiency. This effect is quite unique to aromatherapy - helping to break the circle of illness that causes.. and is caused by.. depression. Regular use of the correct essential oils - particularly in aromatherapy massage - will have a powerful effect on the limbic system, which in turn has an uplifting and natural healing effect on the mind, body and spirit. ************************************************************* Mari's Gold VITALITY Blend was created in March 1999.. and has been a popular blend over the years.
