During treatment, patients typically lie on a padded table and rest with the inserted needles for 30 to 50 minutes, often in a dimly lit room listening to relaxing music. Many research studies support using acupuncture to treat arthritis. However, critics question the validity of clinical studies supporting acupuncture's use.

Others theorize that acupuncture may work because the needles' placement points are located at naturally occurring pressure points that contain bundles of nerve endings. While experts debate its usefulness, most agree that acupuncture is safe [ 3](#footnote3) Sherman KJ, Coeytaux RR. Acupuncture for Improving Chronic Back Pain, Osteoarthritis and Headache.

Reiki attempts to promote vitality and healing by facilitating the delivery of this universal energy to a person. Reiki sessions take 60 and 90 minutes, during which a client lies or sits in a supported and comfortable position. The client remains clothed. The Reiki practitioner positions his or her hands over specific points of the client's body, attempting to guide essential energy into it. A single session may involve 10 to 20 different hand positions. While Reiki is becoming more popular it has not been well researched, and it is not clear whether or not this therapy provides pain relief to arthritis patients. Because it is non-impact it is considered low- to no-risk. - [1](#footnoteref1_x2onjfi)Kim EJ, Lim CY, Lee EY, Lee SD, Kim KS: Comparing the effects of individualized, standard, sham and no acupuncture in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
