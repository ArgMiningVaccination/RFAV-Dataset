I'm excited to invite you to an incredible event this weekend! Join me for an In-Person Ancient Taoist Mudra Meditation & Qigong Class + Sound Ceremony! This class is all about finding balance between Yin & Yang. I'll teach you how to integrate your mind, body, and spirit while working with the ancient healing Taoist energy called the Dan Tain. We'll go over Qigong movements, Mudras, and the fundamentals of breath. Through breathwork, mudras, and Qigong movements, you may experience healing energies that can penetrate and unravel layers of pain, anxiety, trauma, and fear that are creating limitations in your life. This is a life-changing transformational process of working with the Dantian energy that the Chinese have used in the 8 branches of Chinese Medicine for thousands of years. There will also be nature's singing plant and sacred sound meditation. All for maximum Healing. This class is good for all ages and sizes. Low-stress movements. The event will take place on June 10th, 2023, at 2:30 PM at People's House, 3035 W 25th Ave \u00b7 Denver, CO, Denver, CO 80211.
