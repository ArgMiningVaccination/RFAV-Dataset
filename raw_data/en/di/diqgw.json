The Moderna data compared neutralizing antibody responses to D614G (a key mutation in the SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein) and Delta variant, and 94.6% of people age 65 and older who received a booster had what was judged to be an adequate immune response. VRBPAC unanimously recommended that a half dose (50 mcg instead of 100 mcg) be available to certain higher risk individuals who completed the primary two -dose series at least six months prior. The enumerated groups mirrored those in the FDA's expansion of the EUA for the Pfizer vaccine earlier this month: Individuals 65 and older Those 18 -64 years old with risk of severe disease Those 18 -64 years old with high risk of infection as a result of occupational/institutional exposure 8Janssen Booster Dose Janssen provided several studies that have evaluated safety and immunogenicity or efficacy of the vaccine as a second dose administered 2 -3 months after the first dose or as a booster dose administered approximately 6 months after a single dose primary vaccination. While noting the small sample size for the clinical trial, the committee recommended that boosters be made available for those individuals who received the Janssen vaccine. Notably, the VRBPAC recommended that any person who received the vaccine at least two months ago should get a second dose regardless of age or risk factors, essentially voicing skepticism about whether the Janssen regimen should really have been a one - dose vaccine in the first place. There was also discussion about the lack of independent verification and analysis of the data by the FDA. 9Mix-and-Match Boosters The VRBPAC engaged in a robust discussion about mix -and-match booster doses based on a study sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases evaluating the immunogenicity of each of the vaccines following immunization with the same or a different primary series. Roughly 50 volunteers who had received their second dose of the vaccine at least 12 weeks prior and had no history of COVID -19 were selected for each mix -and-match group. The results were short term, 15 and 29 days after the booster dose, and the study was not powered to be used for comparison between arms. 10Mix-and-Match Boosters cont. Reactogenicity of the vaccines was similar to the primary series, with skin pain, malaise, headache, and myalgias occurring in more than half the participants. At baseline, binding antibody concentrations for the Janssen vaccine were 3 -15 times lower than the mRNA vaccines. Nearly all volunteers had a two -fold or greater boost in binding antibodies, regardless of which booster was used. The largest jump in antibodies was seen in volunteers who had Janssen as their primary vaccine followed by an mRNA vaccine booster. Volunteers who received Janssen as their primary vaccine and booster had 7 -10 times lower binding antibody titers than those boosted with the mRNA vaccines. Overall, heterologous boosters were effective, and in every case provided neutralizing antibody titers that would be expected to be protective. 11Mix-and-Match Boosters cont. No formal recommendations were made, but the committee stressed that expanding each EUA every time a new combination of vaccines was considered was unwieldy and that having broad flexibility for the use of any of the vaccines in boosters would make administration easier. It was also noted that not all individuals in the United States will have ready access to the same vaccine they received in the primary series. In summary, mixing -and-matching seems to be a reasonable strategy, at least in the short term. 12Considerations Regarding Authorization of COVID -19 Vaccine Boosters Peter Marks, MD, PhD Director Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research U.S. Food and Drug Administration 13Considerations Regarding Authorization of COVID -19 Vaccine Boosters Peter Marks, MD, PhD CDC-IDSA Meeting October 23, 202115 The Spectrum of SARS -CoV-2 Infection DeathAsymptomatic infection Severe infection/ hospitalizationMild to moderate infection Symptomatic infection Potentially associated with Long COVID -19: Cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic and other symptoms16 Vaccine Effectiveness Over Time Pfizer -BioNTech, Moderna , and Janssen have all submitted data suggesting some waning of effectiveness over time Most evidence is based on neutralizing antibody titers or real - world evidence (RWE) on symptomatic infection Separating waning effectiveness from reduced effectiveness against variants, such as Delta, can be challenging Vaccines are still very effective against serious outcomesWaning immunity in Israel across age groups Rate of confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infections stratified by vaccination period and age group Per 1000 persons, during July 11, 2021 and July 31, 2021 ages 40 -59 ages 16-39 ages 60+Confirmed infection rate per 1000Goldberg et al., https://www.medrxiv.o rg/content/10.1101/20 21.08.24.21262423v1healthcare workers & people at risk healthcare workers & people at risk www.fda.gov17Booster reduces the rate of severe disease* in 60+ and 40 -60 age groups (Poisson regression controlling for age, gender, demographic group, 2nddose period, and incidence in area of residence.
