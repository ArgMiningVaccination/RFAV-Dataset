Treatment Options For Guillain Barre Syndrome The condition is incurable and impairs physical functioning. However, the silver lining is that clinical care can help patients recover over time. These will run over several weeks or months and may require hospital admission. TCM, meanwhile, can speed up recovery from a GBS infection. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) People with a GBS infection are given IVIG in a few large doses. It has a high concentration and diverse collection of antibodies and is prepared from blood donated by thousands of people. IVIG is also used to treat various other autoimmune and infectious diseases. It has the same effect on medical conditions that stem from an unknown cause. These are called idiopathic diseases or conditions. Plasma exchange (Plasmapheresis) The treatment helps remove excess antibodies, abnormal proteins, or harmful substances from the blood. Hence, plasma exchange is a viable option to treat or manage autoimmune, blood, or nervous system disorders. It uses a machine to pull plasma - the liquid portion of blood - from blood cells. The latter is then mixed with a substitute and returned to the body. Herbal decoctions TCM recognizes that the pathological subtypes of GBS have specific effects on different body constitutions. Thus, Physician Yew recommends using [herbal formulas](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/natural-products/supplements/herbal-medicine-basics/) to correct imbalances within the visceral organs or meridians, fibrous tissues (sinews), spinal muscles, and joints.
