This is what every parent should know to make the experience less isolating. By Melissa Willets Updated on June 29, 2023 Getty Images. It was about two days after I lost my baby that my breast milk came in. I vividly remember standing in the shower as the liquid dripped down my foreign-looking body\u2014deflated and empty. Maybe my doctor had mentioned this could happen, but in my haze of grief, I must not have heard him, and now all I felt was numbness and shock. I hadn't expected to lose my pregnancy, so I'd put no thought into what I'd look and feel like at that moment. And the truth is, not too many people talk about what happens to your body after a miscarriage. But as the model Chrissy Teigen bravely shared on Instagram after experiencing a pregnancy loss around 20 weeks, the body post-miscarriage can be painful proof of what you've lost. \"Even though I'm no longer pregnant, every glance in the mirror reminds me of what could have been,\" the famous mom wrote in her honest post that included a photo of her slow-to-diminish bump. From cramping and prolonged vaginal bleeding to sharp changes in hormone levels, the body goes through big changes after a miscarriage. Learn more about what happens to your body after a miscarriage, including how the emotional ramifications can impact you physically as well. Getty Images. Physical Changes After Miscarriage When you are grieving a pregnancy loss, the uncomfortable postpartum healing phase can feel downright impossible to bear\u2014especially if you're not sure what to expect. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), many people can resume most of their normal activities a few days after miscarriage. However, the experience is not the same for everyone as each miscarriage is unique and some people's recovery may take longer. Some people will have fewer or milder symptoms, while others experience the whole gamut of possible side effects with more or less severity. A miscarriage without medical intervention (called expectant management) may have more prolonged symptoms, as medications or surgery (called a dilation and curettage or D&C) tend to speed things along. Generally, when a miscarriage happens early on, there will be fewer physical symptoms. \"The farther along in pregnancy the miscarriage occurs, the more significant the symptoms may be,\" says Megan Gray, M.D., an OB-GYN with Orlando Health Physician Associates. The following are the typical physical changes to expect when you have a miscarriage. Vaginal bleeding and spotting Expect to have a significant amount of bleeding during and after miscarriage. This bleeding includes the passage of clots and fetal tissue. Typically, the farther along the pregnancy was, the more bleeding you will experience. \"Some of the typical body changes that occur after a pregnancy loss include uterine contractions, vaginal bleeding that can be like a light to a heavy period, and passing small dime- or quarter-sized clots,\" explains Dr. Gray. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \"Most of the tissue passes within 2 to 4 hours after the cramping and bleeding start.\" However, while the heaviest bleeding should end within a day, you may experience continuous or intermittent light bleeding and spotting for 4 to 6 weeks. What Does Miscarriage Bleeding Look Like? Uterine cramping Abdominal discomfort is common after a miscarriage. This crampy pain is due to the uterus contracting to expel the uterine lining and any remaining fetal tissue, followed by reducing back to its original size. Typically, these cramps should end within a day of the miscarriage, once all the products of conception have been removed from the uterus. However, as the uterus contracts back to its pre-pregnancy size, you may also experience some mild cramping. Loss of pregnancy symptoms After a miscarriage, pregnancy symptoms, like sore or enlarged breasts, morning sickness, food cravings, back aches, and frequent urination will go away. These symptoms may take from a few days to weeks to subside as the body's hormone levels revert to pre-pregnancy levels. Fatigue The physical and emotional stress of pregnancy loss can cause you to feel more tired than normal. You may also have trouble sleeping due to both the physical and emotional impacts of pregnancy loss. Miscarriage is often a shocking, traumatic, stressful event, so it's understandable that going through such a heartbreaking experience will contribute to fatigue. Research shows that anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress syndrome are also common. Give yourself grace and lots of rest to promote your recovery and a return to your normal energy levels. Achiness The physical (and emotional) process of losing a pregnancy can take its toll, particularly if you went through hours of cramping. Kecia Gaither, M.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.O.G., an OB-GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist in New York, notes that with a later pregnancy loss, some people will experience the full postpartum aches and pains of delivery. \"One can expect stretch marks, abdominal distension, vaginal pain\u2014if delivery entailed an episiotomy\u2014as well as hair loss,\" she says. This experience can leave you feeling achy and spent emotionally and physically. Again, rest, eating well, and self-care are the best remedies. Ask for help from loved ones and your doctor, as needed. Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea The big shifts in hormone levels that come after a miscarriage can result in diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. These gastrointestinal symptoms may also be a side effect of taking medication (like misoprostol) to treat the miscarriage. Grief may also impact your appetite, which in turn can impact what you are eating and exacerbate any gastrointestinal symptoms. Period returning According to the ACOG, your period typically returns about two weeks after the vaginal bleeding from the miscarriage ends. This tends to be about two months after the pregnancy loss. If desired, t is usually safe to try to get pregnant again as soon as after your first period. Breast changes There are a variety of breast changes that happen after a miscarriage. As the breast tenderness and enlargement that comes with pregnancy recedes, your breasts will begin to feel like they did pre-pregnancy. For later miscarriages, after the first trimester, breasts may also become engorged with milk and/or leak some breast milk. Wearing a soft, supportive bra and using ice packs to relieve swelling can help. This experience can be very distressing, so seek emotional support as well. We Need to Talk About the Financial Toll of Miscarriage The Emotional Toll of Miscarriage For those who have experienced a miscarriage, the physical changes can be overshadowed by the emotional toll. \"Patients often are less prepared for the emotional journey than the physical one,\" says Danielle Jones, M.D., a board-certified OB-GYN known on social media as Mama Doctor Jones. \"Some people have a very emotional journey that is full of grief and sadness, others can feel relieved or confused.\" Dr. Gray acknowledges a loss is an emotional experience no matter when in the pregnancy it happens and points out the shift in hormones may exaggerate symptoms. \"With a pregnancy loss, the estrogen and progesterone levels drop quickly. The hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) level will slowly drop to zero over a few weeks\u2014depending on how far along the pregnancy was at the time of loss,\" says Dr. Gray. And all feelings are justified. \"The most important part of the emotional journey after pregnancy loss is to normalize that any range of feelings can be normal and that there is no guilt in pregnancy loss\u2014there's nothing you could have done better or worse,\" says Dr. Jones. What It's Really Like to Have a Miscarriage How to Find Comfort Getting support after experiencing a miscarriage is highly recommended. Your doctor can refer you to a local pregnancy loss support group, and if you experience depression or anxiety, a perinatal psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed mental health therapist can help. It may also be beneficial to open up to friends. Since up to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage, there is a good chance someone you know has been through one. But, as Dr. Gray explains, \"Shame, guilt, disappointment, and failure are all negative emotions that can lead to self-isolating behavior and withdrawal from social connections.\" So, you may not know about someone else's experience until you share your own. Physical and emotional recovery will also take time. My body didn't go back to \"normal\" for a while. \"Surprisingly the physical impact can linger for weeks to months after the loss,\" confirms Laxmi Kondapalli, M.D., MSCE, an at CCRM Fertility in Colorado. \"Many patients have told me that they 'still feel pregnant' after a loss,\" she adds. This was definitely true in my case, with my mind not catching up to my new reality as quickly as I might have hoped. Still today, years later, in many ways, I am forever changed by what I went through. Most of all, I'm left wishing that as a society we would be more open to discussing pregnancy loss and the painful aftermath. As Dr. Jones acknowledges, \"Miscarriage remains taboo, because it is hard to talk about. The best thing we can do is continue the conversation and give space to validate feelings and experiences, no matter what they are.\" Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!
