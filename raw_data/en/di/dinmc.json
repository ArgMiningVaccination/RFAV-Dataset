Get Advanced Treatment for Diabetic Foot Ulcer in Bangalore At Pristyn Care A diabetic foot ulcer is a serious complication of diabetes that cannot be managed through diet, exercise, and even insulin treatment.

Consult The Best Vascular Surgeons in Bangalore To Explore Your Treatment Options The right person to consult for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers is a vascular specialist or a podiatrist. We house a team of vascular specialists who are certified, well-trained, and highly experienced. Our doctors have been handling serious cases of diabetic foot ulcers for a very long time and they have ample knowledge and expertise in treating such problems. The doctor will first diagnose your foot to determine the severity of the ulcer and narrow down the treatment options. If the ulcer is in the early stages, the doctor will recommend using antibiotics, off-loading, or hyperbaric oxygen therapy for initial treatment. If the ulcer has advanced to grade 3 or above, the doctor may need to operate to clean the ulcer, remove the dead tissues, and restore the blood vessels to promote the healing of the wound. The doctor will make sure that you get comprehensive care without any compromise.
