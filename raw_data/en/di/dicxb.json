There are thousands of \"foods\" out there that are generally thought of as health products, but are actually far from health-supporting.

Read on to uncover the health food industry's dirtiest little secrets. 1 of 5 Protein Bars Granola bars and protein bars have generated a reputation as a health food, but in most cases they are sugar bombs \u2014 they can often be full of corn syrup, GMO soy protein, and hydrogenated oils. There are a few bars out there that are made with fruit and nuts, or sweetened more naturally with dates and honey, so take a quick peek at the ingredients before you indulge. A better bet? Make your own trail mix with raw nuts, unsulfured dried fruits, and maybe even a little bit of high-quality dark chocolate.

The problem arises when you are guzzling fruit juice, especially processed, pasteurized bottled juices \u2014 that's an awful lot of sugar concentrated into one glass. Drinking all that sugar will send your insulin levels through the roof, and can promote weight gain. Juicing dark, leafy greens with things like cucumber, celery, lemon, and ginger is a great idea, and you can even add a small piece of green apple for a bit of sweetness if you need it. Even carrot- and beet-based juices can be as high in sugar as some fruit juices, so they aren't the most health-promoting habit if consumed regularly. Juice your veggies, but go easy on the fruits!

Gluten is a huge energy drain and a trigger for inflammation, even in people who haven't been diagnosed as celiac. If you want to eat grains, choose gluten-free alternatives like quinoa, brown rice, or millet. There are some gluten-free breads on the market that may be less processed, but remember to check the ingredients for added sweeteners, preservatives, or high-glycemic fillers like potato, corn, or rice starch. Sprouted grain bread, although it's not gluten-free, can be easier to digest for some people.

The idea that artificial sweeteners make a product healthier is one of the biggest tricks in marketing. Artificial sweeteners are linked to diabetes, autoimmune disorders, depression, anxiety, birth defects, and cancer. They also promote fat storage and weight gain, so there is really no benefit at all to drinking diet soda. My advice? Ditch the soda altogether and stick to water or sparkling water with fresh lemon or lime. Bottom line: When it comes to navigating what's really healthy in the grocery store aisles, stay as close to nature as possible. Reduce the processed, packaged foods that are loaded with \"healthy\" marketing claims, and eat more foods you can picture in nature that don't require any altering or advertising. The fewer ingredients, the better \u2014 you'll be getting more nutrition, and your body will thank you! Are you still drinking diet soda?
