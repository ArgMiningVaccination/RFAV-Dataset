Picked by experts. Loved by you. To thank nature for its precious gifts, we work to ensure sustainability is at the heart of our brand DNA and is considered at every touchpoint of our business. We are learning and growing day by day, bettering our understanding of nature and how we can work harmoniously for people and for planet. [OUR INGREDIENTS](https://www.tisserand.com/about-tisserand-aromatherapy/our-ingredients/) Its what's inside our pure essential oils that really makes the difference. We hold our precious ingredients in the highest regard, treating them with respect from the moment they are harvested to the moment we deliver them to you. We only work with valued partners who we trust care for them before us, and we ensure we help you to care for them once they have left our factory, by housing them in our amber bottles to protect the oils from sunlight. Nature is precious - powerful but delicate - much like our personal wellbeing. For people and for planet, we aim for the highest percentage of natural ingredients in all our products, ensuring our raw materials are ethically and sustainably sourced. We also maintain that all organic essential oils are certified by [The Soil Association](https://www.soilassociation.org/) and all our products are cruelty free and certified by [The Vegan Society.](https://www.vegansociety.com/) OUR PACKAGING Our 100% natural pure essential oils are always housed in amber glass, to protect their therapeutic properties. When we must use plastic in our preblended skin and wash products, we choose PCR - post consumer recycled - to ensure we are using up some of the plastic that exists on the planet already. In order to adapt and sustain this positive change in the industry, this must be a steady transition. All our preblended Wellbeing bottles are now 50% PCR and all new product development is being made with a minimum of 50% PCR bottles. We are busy working on the next step of our sustainability journey but are proud of what we have achieved so far! - All paper-based packaging is fully recyclable. - The majority of our packaging components are recyclable where local markets support this. (PCR caps are particularly tricky for us to get our hands on!) We are working towards 100% recyclable packaging as we speak. - With all new product development we are looking at ways to reduce our packaging to eliminate waste and only produce packaging that fits the original purpose - to protect the integrity of the product inside so you can enjoy it! - All sourced cardboard purchased will be FSC certified.
