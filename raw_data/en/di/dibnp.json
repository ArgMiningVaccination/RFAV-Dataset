Proper immune function requires our own body to discriminate between foreign invaders and our own tissues. This includes optimal digestive capabilities, ability to digest, absorb nutrients and assimilate them. Homeopathy has much to offer a healthy gut brain connection. These include bowel nosodes (homeopathic probiotics) which include taking doses of bacteria from the large intestine to help re-establish good bacteria in the gut. Boosting the Immune system in Homeopathy is a simple principle: 'Like cures Like\", the symptoms of the illness must be matched with the remedy causing the illness. The homeopathic practitioner chooses a remedy to treat symptoms that normally be caused by that remedy at full strength. These immunotherapy remedies have been used for over 200 years.
