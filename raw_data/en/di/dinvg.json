You may ask, \"What are some CAMs that havebeen used in the OR?\" or \"Howcan a practitioner who performs CAMs be permitted in the OR,when in the past only the surgical team involve d in the procedure was permitte d in the O R?\" There's a common misconcep- that \"C AM\" and \"alternative medicine\" are the same; in fact, you may hear the terms used syn-onymously . According to the National Center for Complement- ary and Alternative Medicine,however, C AMs are therapies use d together with conventional medi- cine. 1For example, music therapy delivered through earphones to lessen a patient's discomfort during and following surgery. Alternative medicine is used in place of conven- tional me dicine. F or example, a spe cial diet to treat cancer rather than undergoing surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.1 Various CAMs CAMs include a long list of therapies or modalities, such as acupuncture, aromatherap y, guided imagery, herbalism, homeopathy, hypnosis, massage, music, Qigong, Reiki, and therapeutic touch (TT). ManyCAMs are natural modalities that were commonly used for hundreds of years but were discontinued with the development of antibiotics and other medications. 2Acupuncture Originating in China more than 2,000 years ago, acu- puncture is one of the oldest, most commonly usedtherapies in the world. A cupuncture uses thin ne edles to stimulate anatomical points on the body. The practi- tioner inserts the needles and either a manual or elec-trical te chnique is used in key areas. Key areas are often determined according to symptoms described by the patient. 3 Aromatherapy Aromatherapy is the practice of using volatile plant oils, including essential oils, for psyc holog ical and physical well-being. Essential oils are the pure essence of a plant, not to be confused with perfumed oils, www.ORNurseJournal.com July/August OR Nurse2008 39Complementing traditional surgery Jeanne Hately , RN, MSN, PhD and have been found to provide both psychological and physical benefitswhen used correctly. 4(See Essential oils and effects .) Guided imagery Guided imagery is an effective visualiza- tion technique sometimes referred to asa focused daydream. This method helps patients to focus on positive images toheal their bodies. Guided imagery prac- titioners instruct patients in generalrelaxation exercises and help patientscreate detailed images in their minds. A commonly use d method of guide d imagery is the Simonton Method, devel - oped by oncologist Dr. O. Carl Simon-ton. T he Simonton Method was devise d to help patients undergoing cancer treat- ments to imagine their immune systemeating up and destro ying cancer cells during treatment, thus freeing them ofcancer. 5 Herbalism Herbalism is the practice of prescribing or making herbs for certain me dical conditions, such as recommending black cohosh for the treatment of hot flashes.Many herbalists revert only to herbs forthe treatment of all conditions. Somecaution must b e used as individuals ma y misuse and overdose or have sensitivi- ties to an herb or compound. 6 Homeopathy A German physician in the late 18th century, Samuel Hahnemann, is thefounder of home opathy . Hahnemann worked on the premise of treating \"like with like.\" He studied patient symptomsand determine d that symptoms were the body's way of fighting disease. Homeo- pathy practitioners encourage the symp-toms se en and prescrib e a remedy in small doses that in larger doses would produce the same symptoms displayedin the patient. A ccording to home opa- thy, this method stimulates the immune system to help cure the illness. 7 40 OR Nurse2008 July/August www.ORNurseJournal.comComplementing traditional surgery Essential oils and effects upliftingRefreshing, relaxing, calming, soothing, balancing Sedating, calming, soothing, strengtheningWarming, relaxing, uplifting, calming, causes euphoria Relaxing, refreshing, provides astringent qualities Head clearing, provides antiseptic and decongestant properties, invigorating Provides carminative properties, eases indigestion Relaxing, rejuvenating, eases breathing, dispels fear s Refreshing, relaxing, balancingProvides decongestant propertiesRelaxing, soothing, builds confidence Refreshing, stimulating, relaxing, promotes diuresis Refreshing, relaxing, provides therapeutic qualities, calming, soothing Refreshing, stimulating, uplifting, motivatingToning, refreshing, fortifying Warming, for tifying, sedating Uplif strengthening, rejuvenating, dispels fearsRefreshing, relaxing Relaxing, enhances sensualityCooling, refreshing, head clearingRefreshing, relaxing Refreshing, provides antiseptic properties, invigorating, stimulating Relaxing, soothing, enhances sensuality, builds confidence Invigorating, refreshing, stimulating, clarifying Relaxing, warming, builds confidence, grounding Acts as an antiseptic, strengthens immune system Acts as an antiseptic, refreshing, strengthens immune system Relaxing, soothing, enhances sensualityEssential oil Basil Bergamot Chamomile hypnosis is a technique used by a qualified health professional or therapist who give patientscarefully worded instructions intended to guide the patient into a state of deep relaxation. In this relaxedstate, the patient is aware of everything that's occur- ring but, at the same time, becomes increasinglyabsorbed in using her imagination as directed by theclinician. The clinician monitors the patient through- out the session and is able to reverse the hypnoticstate. 8 Massage Massage is the manipulation of conne ctive tissues and muscles to stimulate circulation andenhance the function of thosetissues to promote relaxationand well-being. Massage thera-py can be highly effective forreducing the symptoms of arthritis, back pain, carpal tun-nel syndrome, and other disor-ders of the muscles and ner - vous system. 9 Music therapy According to the American Music Therapy Association, \"Music therap y is the clinical and evi - dence-based use of music interventions to accom- plish individualized goals within a therapeutic rela-tionship by a cre dentiale d professional who has com - pleted an approved music therapy program.\" 10Music therapy is designed to uplift physical and emotionalhealth through the use of music. It's often used instress management programs or in conjunction withexercise. Music therapy is used in a variety of health-care settings with positive results in both short-termand more serious long-term conditions. 10 Qigong Qigong, similar to T ai Chi is an energy-producing Chinese movement technique that many healthcare providers now recommend for relaxation, stressreduction, and an o verall feeling of well-being. Qigong combines focused concentration with move- ments and balanced breathing in a controlled way.The mo vements are simple, making the technique easy to learn and easy to perform for most patients. Many patients who practice this technique preop-eratively report a decrease in stress and pain postop- eratively. 11 Reiki Reiki is based on the belief that when energy is chan- neled through a Reiki practitioner, the patient's spirit is healed, which in turn heals the body and contributesto an overall feeling of well-being. 12Reiki is practiced by placing the hands on or above the patient in vari- ous positions. A state of deep relaxation and a generalfeeling of well-being is usually one of the most imme- diate effe cts of the treatment. Reiki practice is based on the concept that an unse en life force energy flo ws through all people. If one's life force energy is lo w, that person is more lik ely to get sick or feel stress; if the life force energy ishigh, that person is more capa - ble of being happy andhealthy. 13 Therapeutic touch Reiki and TT are often con- fused, but in essence work on the same principles. TT is a rel-atively modern therapy withorigins in ancient healing prac - tices, and is a technique used to balance and restore the flo w of human energy . 14TT was develope d in the early 1970s by Dora Kunz, a natural healer, and Dolores Krieger, RN, PhD, Professor Emerita ofNursing at New Y ork University and author of sever - al books on the topic. CAMs at work in the OR Some anesthesia providers use aromatherapy in the form of essential oils in the OR to promote relax-ation (lavender) and reduce nausea or perceptions ofsmell (peppermint). Dr. Mehmet Oz, in his book Healing from the Heart , discussed his belief in the value of aromatherapy. Hestated that when patients were g iven a whiff of a flowery scent, their pain was lessened compared with when they sniffed spices, which made the patientmore sensitive to pain. Dr . Oz also suspe cted that aromatherapy could be used to help surgical patients by inducing a relaxation response. Dr. Oz stated thataromatherap y is very appealing b ecause the emotion- al center of the brain is profoundly affected by smell. 15Music therapy has been used in the OR to decrease postoper ative pain and anxiety. 42 OR Nurse2008 July/August www.ORNurseJournal.comComplementing traditional surgery Hypnosis has been used for some time in the pre- operative area and has now extended into the OR.Mind-body methods for surgical application dateback to ancient Egypt. Noteworthy is the use of hyp- nosis in the 1840s by the Scottish surgeon, Dr.James Esdaile, who practiced in India and used hyp- nosis as the anesthetic for eye surgery to limb ampu-tations. During Dr. Esdaile's era, standard surgicalmortality was 40% while Dr. Esdaile's surgical mor- tality was 5%. 16 While under hypnosis, patients can be taught to alter psyc hophysiological functions. Research has shown that hypnosis is b eneficial in reducing anxiety, decreasing blood loss and postoperative nausea andvomiting, lo wering the per- ception of pain, acceleratingwound healing, lo wering complication rates, and short-ening hospital length of stay. 16 The patient b enefits and cost savings make hypnosis both an accessible and feasibleoption for patients who wantto use CAM methods toincrease their healing and sat-isfaction with the o verall peri - operative experience. Hypnosis can b e used with or without an experi - enced professional. 16 It would be difficult to perform massage therapy during a surg ical proce dure, but there are b enefits of massage in the preoperative and postoperative areas. Dr. Phil Barr of Longmont, Colorado, is an advocateof bodywork and prescribes massage for all of hishospitalized patients. Longmont United Hospital isbased on the Planetree model, which provides ahumanized and personalized atmosphere thatattends to the heart and spirit of the patient. Manypreoperative and postoperative patients at this facilityare offered massage for relaxation and to reduceanxiety b efore and after their proce dures. Studies indicate that this trend is catching on throughout the United States. 17 Music therap y in the O R has been used to decrease postoperative pain and anxiety. It's well- known that high levels of postoperative pain can leadto adverse reactions, including extende d hospitaliza - tion and longer recovery times. A study by Tse et al. of postoperative pain percep-tions found that there were significant decreases in the intensity of pain in patients who experiencedmusic therapy during procedures compared withthose who didn't. The patients in this study had lower systolic BP and heart rate readings and tookfewer oral analgesics for pain. 18In another study by Cooke et al., patients who listened to music duringtheir preoperative period had significantly lower lev-els of anxiety than patients who received routine care without music. 19 Finally, a study on the effects of music therapy on the physiolog ic and psychological outcomes in patients who underwent cardiac surgery sho wed evi- dence that patients who listened to music during surgery had asignificant re duction in pain and anxiety postoperatively. 20 Reiki has b een use d success - fully as an adjunct to surgery.21 Reiki practitioners can be in the OR at the patient's re quest as long as the risks are reviewed with the patient and practitionerand b oth sign the re quired waivers. Reiki induces relaxation, relieves stress, and can lo wer the patient's BP and heart rate. Because Reiki is noninvasive, it's often referre d to as a hands-on healing technique. Acting through the autonomic nervous system to lower BP and heartrate, it can relieve anxiety and stress. It's b elieve d that this technique encourages a feeling of well-being, assisting the immune system in defending againstbacteria and viruses. This feeling of well-being stimu-lates the production of endorphins in the brain,thereby decreasing the brain's perception of pain. 21 Operatively, the Reiki practitioner stands at the head of the O R table, or wherever appropriate, and uses light touch to channel energy to the patient. This is coordinated with the circulating nurse, anesthesiaprovider, and surge on before the case begins to avoid any confusion or stressful situation in the OR. Some patients request a Reiki session with their prac-titioner imme diately b efore surgery, which reportedly has the same benefits as stated above for patients during and after surgery. 22 TT can b e used in the preoperative and postopera- tive areas. The practitioner uses her hands to facilitate the healing process by the exchange of energy. TTSome anesthesia pro- viders use aromatherapy to promote relaxation and reduce nausea or perceptions of smell. www.ORNurseJournal.com July/August OR Nurse2008 43repatterns the body's energy field so that the patient's own natural healing can begin. Hartford Hospital inConnecticut provides patients with TT to help thehealing process. TT has been reported to create a relaxation response, alleviate anxiety and tension,alter the perception of pain and discomfort, and noticeably enhance the body's natural healingprocess. 23It may also help accelerate healing of wounds, fractures, and infections.23 Future research Future researc h may explore other CAMs that can be used in the O R to benefit the patient without compro- mising the integrity of the sterile field or surgical site. CAMs ha ve been identifie d as the third way to cut healthcare costs; the first two are cutting b enefits and raising taxes. Ruggie stated that alternative medicinepromises an inclusive, inno vative, and fiscally respon - sible solution to helping cut healthcare costs. 24It's incumbent upon surgeons and perioperative nursesto familiarize themselves with the psyc holog ical and physiologic effects of surgery on the patient and with the literature on CAMs. This information is useful inmodifying the adverse reactions of surgery, as well asimproving outcome measures to offer patients themaximum benefit from surgery. Impro vement in surg ical outcomes measures using CAMs, including monitoring anxiety, blood loss, post- operative pain levels, pain me dication re quirements, postoperative nausea and vomiting, recovery of bowel function, length of hospital stay, cost of care, andpatient satisfaction, ha ve been documented in various studies. CAMs have been noted to be highly beneficial in improving preoperative, intraoperative, and postop-erative patient outcomes. Although there are studiesavailable, there's a need for further research and docu-mentation by and for perioperative nurses. As more is learned about the effects of CAM ther- apies, these spe cific effe cts can b e integrated into and used with other more traditional pain treatments as a means to maximize overall efficacy of pain treatmentand perception. In this wa y, nurses can se ek to ensure that the greatest number of patients obtain the great- est benefit from the care offered. OR REFERENCES 1.
