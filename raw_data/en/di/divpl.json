The microbes are also known as pathogens. A microbe infects an organism (which is known as the host of the microbe). In a human host, the microorganism causes a disease by either disrupting an important body process or by stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. The pathogen, interferes with the normal functioning of the host and can lead to chronic wounds, gangrene, loss of an infected limb, and even death. The host's response to infection is inflammation. An interaction between parasite and host, whereby the relationship is beneficial for the former but detrimental to the latter, is characterized as parasitism. Through much scientific research, a bacteria called Yersinia Pestis was discovered. This bacteria is spread by both animals and insects. This specific bacteria attacks the lymph system causing the infection to spread throughout the body. The reservoirs of this bacteria and disease are mice, rats, squirrels and other small animals. A reservoir is a host of an infection. The vector, meaning carrier, is insects such as fleas and A viruses is a non-living infection agent and can be found anywhere. it has no cell organelles. They are eliminated by the immune system. Viruses are the smallest in size of all the microbes. they may attack almost any living organism. Viruses will invade a cell in the body and uses part of the cell to multiple causing new viruses to produce. Bacteria are much larger than viruses. they live everywhere. many bacteria will not cause an infection. Bacteria multiple itself by division. Viruses and bacteria both are microscopic, contain proteins, and cause disease. There are many different ways to pass away, some harsher than others. In \"The Hot Zone\" By Richard Preston, there are a few different viruses explained to be deadly to not only humans, but other species as well. The hot zone is an area on earth that contains lethal, infectious organisms. Marburg virus, Ebola Zaire, and Sudan virus all contribute to making the hot zone so pernicious. Bloodborne pathogens are microorganisms that present in human blood and they can cause diseases. These pathogens include: - Viruses such as hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), also, parasites such as malaria and certain fungi. Sharp-tools, needle-sticks and other apparatus-related injuries may expose stuff to bloodborne pathogens. To eliminate the risk of occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens, implement an exposure control plan for workers on their worksite with enough details on protection measure. The plan must also describe how a worker will use personal protective, work practice controls, clothing and equipment, employee training, medical surveillance, hepatitis B vaccinations, and other provisions as required by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. Diagnosing smallpox can be made in several ways; by the signs and symptoms that the person presides with; by withdrawing the variola virus from the persons blood or from the lesions; and from antibodies found in the infected persons blood that reacted to the virus. Diagnosing this virus is made in specific laboratories only where there are suitable means for testing and protecting the laboratory technicians (https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/smallpox/fact_sheet). The United States military installations that provide for our homeland security are secretly creating a \"zombie\" strain capable of mimicking the behaviors of the undead. Government officials will try to justify their means by using words like \"National Security\" to combat the biochemical agent threat. The viruses will mutate into new strains capable of spreading like a flu. The host will be na\u00efve concerning the ill effects of the strain and only the military will have an experimental serum to treat the infected keeping it at bay. Bioterrorist use strains to gain a strategic or tactical advantage over their enemies. The world will be devastated by this phenomenon where reanimated corpses will eat the living. Nevertheless, military officials will fail to contain To shoot or not to shot? This is a major question from the majority who have lost confidence in the influenza vaccine, also called the flu shot. I am going to be up front with you, to tell my personal opinion of how I feel about this shot. To me, it's a two-sided story, why or why not children should obtain the flu shot. For instance, I really believe that the age of six months is too young for a flu shot. This only my opinion, furthermore in this presentation of pros and cons concerning the flu shot, included are statements from average people who have basic concerns for and against this shot. Facts are also noted from professional experts that give reason as to why the flu shot is vital to adults as well as children. Smallpox is a highly contagious and fatal disease that had a huge impact on the human population. It is thought to have been originated from India or Egypt at least 3,000 years ago. Smallpox is caused by two variations of the variola virus, variola major and variola minor. Variola major is the most common form of smallpox. It enters the body through the lungs and is carried to the internal organs. Then, the skin is infected and boils and rashes will appear all over. Smallpox is spread through contact between people and saliva when talking, coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread rapidly when the boils on the skin burst, leading to the smallpox DNA going everywhere.The highly infectious disease ravaged and plagued across the globe, decimating a large number of the population. In the 18th century, it had an astonishing mortality rate of 90% in the United States. Also, in the year 1966, it was estimated that 10-15 million citizens had died altogether. Smallpox was finally proclaimed eradicated in 1980. Nowadays, only government laboratories in the United States and Russia contains fragments of the virus for research purposes. However, if used as a biological warfare agent, it is a immense threat to humanity and civilization because of its case-fatality of more than 30%. No cure or treatment for smallpox exists. Luckily, there is a vaccine to prevent it. Although the vaccine may have some side effects causing harm to the body, it is the only way to prevent smallpox. In lab 3, fundamentals of chromatography, the purpose was to examine how components of mixtures can be separated by taking advantage of different in physical properties. A huge process in this lab was paper chromatography, which was used to isolate food dyes that are found in different drink mixes. The different chromatograms of FD&C dyes were compared to identify which dyes are present in each of the mixes. Chromatograms where made for the known FD&C and for the three Kool-Aid samples. The retention factor for each dye was calculated. F or each of the Kool-Aid flavors, 2.0 g was weighed out from the packet and 5mL of water was mixed in with them each. mL of 0.1% NaCl solution was added to 100mL of bottled water. The six chromatography strips When we consider if a virus is a living object we need to get the rules on living things, look at the characteristics of the virus, and compare the characteristics to the rules. A few of the virus characteristics are listed here. Viruses have at least two parts, an outer capsid When you say that an organism is a living thing, what things do you consider? Can it move? Does it make its own food? Are there others like it? When you think of a virus, do you say that it is alive or dead? I believe that viruses are nonliving Cough, cough, dead. Viruses have been plaguing people for thousands of years. Over time, some viruses have been cured or have been eradicated. However, some viruses have only gotten stronger and deadlier. Influenza, Hantavirus, and the Marburg Virus are some of the deadliest diseases in the world, but they all work and kill differently. b. Because it is only a prediction, occasionally the virus created in the lab doesn't match up with the circulating virus. The purpose of this lab was to determine which of the following substances: wax, sugar, and salt, are an ionic compound and which are a covalent compound. In order to accurately digest the experiments results, definitions of each relating factor were researched, leading to the following information: ionic compounds are positive and negatively charged ions that experience attraction to each other and pull together in a cluster of ionic bonds; they are the strongest compound, are separated in high temperatures, and can be separated by polar water molecules. A covalent compound is formed when two or more nonmetal atoms share valence electrons; covalent compounds are also categorized into two sections: polar covalent and nonpolar covalent. Furthermore, polar covalent compounds dissolve in water, while nonpolar covalent compounds do not. Dissolving is the process in which a solvent and a solute interact with each other and form a solution. Melting is a physical, or state, change of a solid to a liquid. Based on the provided information if a substance requires a high temperature to melt and dissolves in water, then it is an ionic compound; and if a substance requires a low temperature to melt and does not dissolve in water, then it is a covalent compound. I predict that salt will be an ionic compound, since it is soluble in water, and sugar and wax will be covalent compounds because they "}
