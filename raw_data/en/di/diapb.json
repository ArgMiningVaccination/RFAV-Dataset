Autism spectrum disorder impacts the nervous system and affects the overall reasoning, emotional, social and physical health of the affected individual. The range and severity of symptoms can vary widely. Common symptoms include difficulty with communication, difficulty with social interactions, obsessive interests and repetitive behaviours. Early recognition, as well as behavioural, educational and family therapies may reduce symptoms and support development and learning. We see this as more of a disorder of the body that has caused certain disabilities in a human being. It is very sad to classify this as a problem of the mind alone and treat patients with psychotic drugs. "}
