Inrecent years, noother cultural minority hasimpacted America more significantly thattheSoutheast Asian refugee group. 1)Southeast Asian Exodus Impacts America According toWorld Refugee Survey (1984), over750,000 Southeast Asian refugees have settled intheUnited States since 1975. Ofthese refugees, 350,000 reside inCalifornia. This refugee movement, which began asaresult ofgovernments collapsing inSouth Vietnam, Cambodia (now called Kampuchea) andLaos, 1983; inOwan, 1985). 2)Diversity Cultural Groups TheSoutheast Asian population consists ofdiverse cultural groups from Vietnam, China, Cambodia (Kampuchea) andLaos (Lewis, May 1985). Within these groups, awide variety ofreligious, national, environmental, ethnic, economic, educational andpolitical backgrounds InLaos, three ofLaotians donotshare similar historical orethnic origins.

Morin concluded overall, \"theHmong transition remains painfully slow.\" TheHmong were amountain people thathadlimited contact with theoutside world. Almost every aspect ofAmerican lifesharply contrasts with theHmong families' adjustment difficulties abound inthemedia. Some examples include families using furniture polish ascooking oil,trying toheattheir homes withcharcoal taskofproviding sensitive care toavulnerable ofthisculture. In turning totheliterature, apaucity ofinformation exists regarding traditional caring practices oftheHmong. While most research reports preface their findings with theacknowledgement ofdifferences in Southeast Asian cultural groups, precise literary distinctions areoften lacking forthenewer andsmaller groups thisstudy willoffer insight intothevarious caring practices that Hmong parents may utilize before orinconjunction with seeking Western health care fortheir children. Background knowledge ofethnic caring practices willhelp cultural values maycreate opportunities toblend traditional ethnic caring practices with scientific caring practices inanattempt toincrease compliance withWestern health care.IV. China, andLewis, 1984) Legend tells ofapeople who lived inaland Vang andLewis, 1984; Dao, in andOlney, 1982). Over 4000 years ago, theHmong cultivated theplains of southwestern China andlived themselves people persecuted their southern neighbors anddrove them from their homeland. Fifty thousand families hastily migrated further south, past theborders of hadincreased to250,000 orten percent oftheir newly adopted Laotian homeland.

Approximately three thousand Hmong were airlifted from Laos by AirAmerica (operated bytheCentral Intelligence Agency), butthemajority were leftto seek refuge within thewestern border country ofThailand (Nelson andHewitt, 1983; Public Broadcasting Systems, non-fiction television, 1982). Long arduous journeys onfootthrough rugged jungle terrain andthesurging Mekong River waters took aheavy tollonthefleeing villagers (Britton, 1986).

Kleinman, Eisenberg andGood (1978) and Eisenberg (1977) disease condition inthe structure itself toculturally universal (etic) 17categorization. Illness, ontheother hand, stems from culturally specific (emic) categories where individuals experience devalued changes inthestate ofbeing andinsocial function. Illness iscolored bythesubjective nature ofhuman experience.

Magical perceptions ofdisease were thought tobeattributed to human manipulation offorces through sorcery orcounter-sorcery. Religious manifestations thought tocause disease were identified asthose forces beyond therealm of and,therefore, notsubject means argued fordistinguishing causation fallwithin personalistic systems ornaturalistic medical systems. Findings from thestudies ofSoutheast Asian cultures support Foster and Anderson's home arerendered family inaneffort setting. Studies based onthecommonalities ofempirical constructs within medical anthropology find that allknown human groups develop methods forcoping with or responding todisease (Wellin, inLandy, 1977). Instudying thesocial ofhealth care, Kleinman (1973) reports three domains ofhealth caredelivery: professional, popular (family, social network andcommunity), domains, thepopular domain oflimited and careoutcomes. Johnston hassimilarly observed use ofnon-traditional 19traditional methods within theUnited States. Theauthor reports that, should scientific knowledge appear incompatible with thepatient's traditional beliefs, thetraditional waywill probably win. Inthestudy ofcare-giving folkremedies Thefolkremedies ofcoin-rubbing, cupping, pinching, herbal steam baths andbalm applications were inthereview of literature ascare-giving practices thatwere thought tobeused bytheHmong culture. As previously documented, studies ofSoutheast Asian groups observed that, should the family member continue tobeillafter home remedies were given, other causes ofillness were suspected andoutside help wassought. Care-seeking practices. Leininger (1981, p.370) states that Folk health practices have existed forthousands ofyears andithasbeen the primary care, Leininger's toward folkhealth care. Toillustrate, folkpractitioners held amore caring andhumanistic attitude than didprofessional practitioners. Care was more often given inthehome setting byfolkpractitioners who were familiar tothefamily seeking whymany people usethescientific system forsymptom relief tocure illnesses Aswith modern medicine, avariety ofspecialists exist among folkhealers. The specialists more commonly observed innon-Western societies were shamans orwitch doctors with supernatural powers, herbalists, bonesetters andmidwives (Foster and Anderson, 1978). Two specialists thatarewidely recognized andutilized among the Southeast Asians aretheherbalist andtheshaman. 20Theherbalist acquires healing skills inafarlessdramatic manner than theshaman (Foster andAnderson, 1978). Family members may pass down, through subsequent generations, their understanding ofplants andtheir medicinal properties. Knowledge from observing theeffect mixtures ofherbs aretested fortheir ability to cure. Those mixtures thought tobesuccessful were duly noted andbecame partofa repertoire oftraditional remedies. The works ofherbalists have been innumerous cultures, such asthose found andMexico (Hautman, 1979). role whospecializes andsupernatural contribution ofnative remedies Mexico, Borneo, Africa andacross America (Foster and Anderson, 1978). Thecommon thread among these reports istheshaman's purported ability arethought powers from adivine source. According to Landy (1977), powers avariety Hierarchy ofcaring practices. Inrendering care toasickfamily selecting apattern ofpriorities hasbeen observed called \"hierarchy of resort ofcurative practices.\" Romanucci-Ross (a.k.a Schwartz, 1969) noted certain health andillness concepts were common insocieties having determine thenextattempt torestore health caring practices might vacillate back andforth between theWestern andtraditional approach until theillness subsided. found ofillness andcaring practices were arranged inasequential fashion. Asinthe aforementioned case, Scott (1974) found corresponding patterns ofhealth careamong five ethnic groups inMiami, Florida. Byobserving group hadunique patterns forusing their traditional health systems andWestern health systems. However, among allfiveethnic groups, theauthor noted Conceptual framework ofHmong caring practices Hierarchy ofcaring practices First resort ofcare Second resort ofcare investigative technique isrecommended byPolit andHungler (1983) andbyWilson (1985) when there islittle background known onthesubject under investigation. Inthisinstance, there was apaucity ofnursing literature specifically addressing Hmong ethnic caring practices intheSoutheast Asian cultural group. Therefore, thisnaturalistic approach was chosen forthepurpose ofeliciting anddescribing criteria which (1970) probability orrandom sampling wasabrogated infavor born inLaos, States, forthisstudy, theinterpreter scheduled aninterview with this family while they were visiting inSacramento. Theother exception was amother and father whose firsttwochildren were born inarefugee camp inThailand rather than in 24Laos. This family wasretained inthestudy because itbecame apparent during the interview process traditional care-giving andcare-seeking practices while theonefamily mentioned above. Theremaining subjects lived inthe Sacramento area, which included North Highlands, Ranch Cordova, andSouth Sacramento. Thehomes ofthese subjects were mostly situated complexes inlow-income took place inthehomes ofthe Hmong families ortheir asfollows: Time: Inmost cases, prior thesubjects intheir own environment. Allinterviews took place Structure: and subjects: The useofinterpretersTheroleoftheresearcher wasunambiguous.

Acopy oftheconsent from was given family were proficient inconversational English sotheresearcher interviewed these subjects without assistance. During datacollection, atotal ofseven different interpreters were used: fourmale andthree female. Their ages ranged from teen aged familiar with andobjectives ofthisresearch project. Hethentranslated the consent form andquestionnaire language andwasinstrumental in providing access toHmong families andinsecuring additional interpreters. Each interpreter wasprovided aconsent form written inboth Hmong andEnglish.

Questions folkremedies datawere constructed by frequency percentages through theuseofacomputer. Responses from open-ended questions were evaluated through content analysis. According toWilson (1985), content analysis isaway tocategorize andtoanalyze caring practices. Subcategories, such asskinmanifestations from using afolktreatment, flowed from the general category ofaparticular caring practice such Lee, Mua, Yang, Lo, Vue, Moua, Ho,Xiong, Kha, Thao, Cha andLao.

Several families graciously presented various herbs and medicines totheresearcher anddescribed how these supplies were used totakecare oftheir sickchildren. Satchels ofroots, herbs andmedicines were displayed. Leaves were plucked from herbs growing inkitchen pots. Vegetable andherb gardens were strolled through asHmong families revealed their knowledge andsupply ofherbs andmedicines from Thailand andLaos. These products came from awide variety ofsources. Some families were able to bring seeds from Laos andgrow green herbs inthiscountry. Themountain regions ofthe theUnited States have provided some herbal sources fortheHmong. Others brought their supply ofroots anddried herbs from Laos andused them until their supplies were exhausted. Onefamily reported thatcustoms officials confiscated their herbs and medicines upon entering the the United States. Some families areable tobuyroots and seeds from other Hmong families who have aplentiful supply. Many Hmong families are frequenting Chinese andThai markets States ofherbal remedies arefrom pods, seeds, leaves, treebark or branches, roots, rock crystals andmossy rock coverings.
