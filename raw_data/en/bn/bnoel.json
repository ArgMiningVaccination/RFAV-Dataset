Many plants that contain RIPs are listed in the pharmacopoeias of folk medicine all over the world, mostly because of their toxicity. This review analyses the position occupied in traditional medicine by plants from which RIPs have been isolated. The overview starts from the antique age of the Mediterranean area with ancient Egypt, followed by the Greek and Roman classic period. Then, the ancient oriental civilizations of China and India are evaluated. More recently, Unani medicine and European folk medicine are examined. Finally, the African and American folk medicines are taken into consideration. In conclusion, a list of RIP-expressing plants, which have been used in folk medicine, is provided with the geographical distribution and the prescriptions that are recommended by traditional healers. Some final considerations are provided on the present utilization of such herbal treatments, both in developing and developed countries, often in the absence of scientific validation. The most promising prospect for the medicinal use of RIP-expressing plants is the conjugation of purified RIPs to antibodies that recognise tumour antigens for cancer therapy.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2016-11-18", "cleaned_text": "Plants Producing Ribosome-Inactivating Proteins in Traditional Medicine [https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules21111560](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules21111560) [Ribosome-Inactivating Proteins--Commemorative Egyptian Medicine [37](#B37-molecules-21-01560)]. [38](#B38-molecules-21-01560)]. Castor bean was also prescribed as a drug for internal use due to laxative or abortifacient intents. The toxicity of castor bean was well known, and only small amounts of seeds were utilized to prepare drugs for oral ingestion. In most cases, castor bean-containing medicinal preparations were based on the nontoxic fat component of the kernels, which was used in formulations both for external use with the aim of healing or soothing the skin and for internal use with a laxative purpose as castor bean oil. [155](#B155-molecules-21-01560)], which are known to express RIPs ([ [156](#B156-molecules-21-01560)], reviewed in [ [157](#B157-molecules-21-01560)]). Barley, peas and wheat were prescribed for external application such as poultices against skin irritation and to obtain an astringent effect. The plants belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family were included in most preparations with plant ingredients probably due to their purgative action [ [155](#B155-molecules-21-01560)]. Barley was also used to detect pregnancy and to determine the sex of the foetus (reviewed in [ [158](#B158-molecules-21-01560)]). [159](#B159-molecules-21-01560)]. A great portion of the medical and botanical knowledge of the ancient Hebrew people, including the pharmacological properties of the plants, was possibly acquired during the period of permanence in Egypt [ [39](#B39-molecules-21-01560)]. 3. Classic Age Medicine [35](#B35-molecules-21-01560), [36](#B36-molecules-21-01560)]. [36](#B36-molecules-21-01560)]. Elderberry was defined as \"nature's medicine chest\" by Hippocrates because of its health benefits in a variety of diseases, in particular as a diuretic and a laxative. Dioscorides first distinguished the elderberry from the dwarf elder (Sambucus ebulus L.), while recognizing that both plants exhibited the same medicinal properties. Today elderberry is still acknowledged for its properties against oxidative stress and its use is suggested for the treatment of influenza [ [126](#B126-molecules-21-01560)]. [21](#B21-molecules-21-01560)]. Accordingly, Pliny recognized the therapeutic properties as an aperient, which was attributed by the Greeks to castor beans. 4. Traditional Chinese Medicine [28](#B28-molecules-21-01560)], is a result of a series of rearrangements carried out over the centuries. Traditional Chinese medicine includes among herbal drugs a number of plants that produce RIPs, as detailed in [Table 1](#molecules-21-01560-t001). [28](#B28-molecules-21-01560)], reviewed in [ [29](#B29-molecules-21-01560)]). The latex of the castor bean plant was instilled in the ear of the patient to cure rhinitis, whereas the seeds were used for anthelmintic activity. For external use, a seed poultice or leaf juice was recommended to treat ulcers and chronic wounds (reviewed in [ [112](#B112-molecules-21-01560)]). Leaves, inflorescences and seeds of Celosia argentea L. (cockscomb) have been prescribed for internal use to cure haematological and gynaecologic disorders and for external use in the treatment of inflammation and as a disinfectant [ [42](#B42-molecules-21-01560)]. [46](#B46-molecules-21-01560)]). [59](#B59-molecules-21-01560)]. The fruits of the colocynth have been prescribed for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, respiratory infections, diabetes and cancer (reviewed in [ [53](#B53-molecules-21-01560)]). Fresh Stellaria media L. (chickweed) juice has been administered for the treatment of viral diseases and dermatitis [ [132](#B132-molecules-21-01560)]. A variety of plants that were used in traditional medicine in China, India, Japan and Korea to treat diabetes due to their anti-hyperglycaemic activity includes Trichosanthes cucumeroides Maxim. (Japanese angelica-tree), barley, Zea mays L. (corn), asparagus, Panax ginseng Meyer (Chinese ginseng), Panax quinquefolium L. (American ginseng) and a number of Cucurbitaceae (reviewed in [ [23](#B23-molecules-21-01560)]). [49](#B49-molecules-21-01560)]. [160](#B160-molecules-21-01560)]. 5. Ayurveda Medicine [161](#B161-molecules-21-01560)]. A number of RIP-expressing plants are included in such recipes in addition to the antidiabetic herbs and garden quinine, which were already mentioned in relation to traditional Chinese medicine, as described below. [13](#B13-molecules-21-01560)], reviewed in [ [162](#B162-molecules-21-01560)]). [113](#B113-molecules-21-01560)]). [93](#B93-molecules-21-01560)]). In ancient times, the juice of the fruit was used as a remedy in cases of snake poisoning. It was also considered effective for the alleviation of pain in the joints and against chronic fever. It was deemed to be helpful in cases of jaundice and disorders of the liver or the digestive system for its diuretic, laxative and anti-helminthic actions. The juice of the leaves and fruits was applied externally to cure chronic disorders of the skin as well as in the treatment of burns, boils and eruptions. The ingestion of the plant may help control excessive sugar in the urine and blood, and its medicinal chemistry has been revised together with the biochemical properties and mechanisms of its beneficial effects in the treatment of diabetes (reviewed in [ [94](#B94-molecules-21-01560), [95](#B95-molecules-21-01560)]). A variety of herbal remedies were prescribed in Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani medicine for the treatment of diabetes, including asparagus, bitter melon, castor bean, colocynth and jequirity. A decoction of cockscomb seeds has been reported to possess anti-diabetic properties, according to traditional Indian medicine [ [40](#B40-molecules-21-01560)]. [5](#B5-molecules-21-01560)]. Trichosanthes cucumerina L. (snake gourd) is an edible vegetable that is grown in Asia, Australia and the Pacific Islands, known since ancient times, and is also used in Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani traditional medicines as a drug anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-ovulatory, larvicidal, and hepato- and gastro-protective activity (reviewed in [ [133](#B133-molecules-21-01560)]). The ingestion of the fresh juice of the winter melon, also called kundur fruit, was suggested in Ayurveda for the treatment of diabetes, nervous diseases, peptic ulcers and urinary disorders, whereas in Korean traditional medicine, it was used to cure dropsy, liver and intestinal diseases (reviewed in [ [30](#B30-molecules-21-01560)]). In addition, a number of other RIP-expressing plants listed in [Table 1](#molecules-21-01560-t001)have been recognized as having anti-diabetic properties in Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani medicine, although the mechanism of anti-diabetic activity has been attributed to plant components other than RIPs [ [54](#B54-molecules-21-01560)]. 6. Unani Medicine [46](#B46-molecules-21-01560)]). In addition, in Unani medicine, many herbal remedies were common to Ayurveda, in particular those reported for the treatment of diabetes. [50](#B50-molecules-21-01560)], Iran (reviewed in [ [51](#B51-molecules-21-01560)]) and Pakistan [ [22](#B22-molecules-21-01560)], the fruits, roots and seeds of the colocynth have been prescribed to cure diabetes and parasitic, infectious and inflammatory diseases but also as a diuretic, cathartic and abortive drug. In Jordanian traditional medicine, beet leaves and roots have been used to obtain relief against acute and chronic inflammation [ [34](#B34-molecules-21-01560)]. Rice has been identified as a remedy against diarrhoea in the traditional medicine of Palestine [ [100](#B100-molecules-21-01560)]. [63](#B63-molecules-21-01560)]). The use of dwarf elder has been recommended as an anti-fungal remedy against mycotic skin infections [ [119](#B119-molecules-21-01560)] and as a painkiller to treat a variety of bone and joint pathologies [ [120](#B120-molecules-21-01560)]. In addition, the aqueous extract of castor bean leaves has been mentioned to alleviate the pain induced by chronic knee osteoarthritis [ [118](#B118-molecules-21-01560)]. [89](#B89-molecules-21-01560)]. Amaranthus viridis L. (amarant) has been used in Indian Ayurdeda and Pakistan traditional medicine as a whole-plant decoction to stop dysentery, the root juice has been used to treat inflammation, and the leaves were recommended for snake bites and scorpion stings [ [22](#B22-molecules-21-01560)]. Chenopodium album L. (lambsquarters) has been prescribed in Indian Ayurvedic and Pakistan Unani medicine under the name of bathu as a diuretic, laxative, sedative, and hepatoprotective drug, as well as in veterinary medicine for its anthelmintic properties [ [45](#B45-molecules-21-01560)]. The same use against animal parasites was traditionally diffuse in Ethiopia [ [44](#B44-molecules-21-01560)]. Poultices of leaves or seeds of castor bean were administered for external use to cure gout and rheumatism as well as to treat wounds, boils and sores, while the juice of the leaves was given orally to treat liver disease [ [22](#B22-molecules-21-01560)]. [32](#B32-molecules-21-01560)]; bottle gourd was used to treat headache by wrapping the head with its leaves, whereas the oil obtained from the ripe fruits of bitter melon, macerated in olive oil warmed by the sun, was combined with honey and used for the prevention and healing of gastric ulcers [ [80](#B80-molecules-21-01560)]. A decoction of dwarf elder flowers was used against cough, while an external application of a leaves decoction was considered effective in the treatment of snakebites and as a roots poultice to alleviate rheumatism pain. A decoction of elderberry flowers was suggested for a variety of pulmonary diseases including bronchitis and asthma. A decoction of mistletoe fruits and leaves was recommended for the treatment of many different affections [ [97](#B97-molecules-21-01560)]. This traditional medicine is still practiced among Islamic populations and many of the herbal remedies above listed are still recommended in Oriental and Middle East countries, as well as in Africa. 7. European Folk Medicine [141](#B141-molecules-21-01560)], reviewed in [ [142](#B142-molecules-21-01560)]). [112](#B112-molecules-21-01560)]). The ability of promoting lactation by castor bean may be interpreted as a result of the irritating action that can be induced by subtoxic amounts of ricin, but can be also caused by other undetermined substances present in castor bean leaves. Elderberry has been traditionally used as a decoction of flowers and leaves to treat cough and asthma, or for external application in the case of pimples and for eye inflammation, as well as an ointment that was prepared with bark and pith in olive oil to alleviate burns. Wheat preparations were applied on skin lesions as a bran decoction that was mixed with vinegar to cure sprains, as flour in olive oil in the case of whitlows, mixed with crushed snails for burns and wounds and as a whole germ in honey to cicatrize burns. A decoction of mistletoe was placed on chilblains to favour healing [ [124](#B124-molecules-21-01560)]. [157](#B157-molecules-21-01560)]). The aerial part of mistletoe was mixed with garlic and was used as an ethanolic extract for internal use for sedative and diuretic properties in the case of nervous tachycardia and insomnia, arteriosclerosis and hypertension [ [127](#B127-molecules-21-01560)]. [125](#B125-molecules-21-01560)]). 8. African Folk Medicine [20](#B20-molecules-21-01560)]. [88](#B88-molecules-21-01560)]. [109](#B109-molecules-21-01560)].

[53](#B53-molecules-21-01560), [56](#B56-molecules-21-01560), [57](#B57-molecules-21-01560)]. [73](#B73-molecules-21-01560)]. The stem bark is used for the treatment of infertility and miscarriage [ [74](#B74-molecules-21-01560)]. [7](#B7-molecules-21-01560)]. [82](#B82-molecules-21-01560)]. [106](#B106-molecules-21-01560)]. Mistletoe leaves, given as a juice or as decoction, find application in the therapy of hypertension [ [143](#B143-molecules-21-01560)]. [106](#B106-molecules-21-01560)]. Phytolacca dodecandra L'H\u00e9r.

The mechanism has been related to its uptake by, and high toxicity to, placental trophoblast cells, that also justify its application in the treatment of choriocarcinoma [ [166](#B166-molecules-21-01560)]. [167](#B167-molecules-21-01560)]). [95](#B95-molecules-21-01560)]). [141](#B141-molecules-21-01560)]. The anti-tumour activity of mistletoe preparation was evaluated through an overview of 23 clinical studies showing considerable heterogeneity of the trials and variable outcomes. Thus, properly designed further investigations are required to validate the efficacy of mistletoe as anti-cancer drug (reviewed in [ [142](#B142-molecules-21-01560)]). The anti-proliferative role of the toxic type 2 RIP present in mistletoe was not ascertained in these trials, however it cannot be excluded. Sometimes, great influence has been attributed to the growth conditions of the medicinal plant. Representative of this impact is the relevance of the plant on which mistletoe is a parasite on its pharmacologic properties (reviewed in [ [168](#B168-molecules-21-01560)]). [169](#B169-molecules-21-01560)]. In vitro studies indicated anti-oxidant, anti-viral and anti-proliferative effects of elderberry fruit preparations. The aqueous elderberry extract showed promising results in the treatment of viral influenza infection of chimpanzees. An anti-viral and anti-inflammatory action has been suggested in humans, but need further support by more rigorous clinical trials. The pharmacological role of type 2 RIPs contained in these preparations has not been clarified, although their antiviral activity is known (reviewed in [ [125](#B125-molecules-21-01560)]). [64](#B64-molecules-21-01560)]). However, no evidence is available that these effects may be related to the presence of a RIP. [170](#B170-molecules-21-01560)]. 11. Conclusions [171](#B171-molecules-21-01560)], reviewed in [ [172](#B172-molecules-21-01560)]). [173](#B173-molecules-21-01560)]), the presence of a RIP could contribute to the above activities by reducing the macrophagic response to pathogens, which is in many cases responsible of producing inflammatory cytokines. In addition, very often RIP-containing plants have been used in the treatment of various skin affections. Besides the anti-phlogistic effect, the presence of RIP in medicinal preparations for external use could have a disinfectant action and so promote healing of the lesions. However, the exact role of RIPs in herbal remedies remains unclear because in most cases, the traditional prescriptions consist of a mixture of different plants. [157](#B157-molecules-21-01560), [174](#B174-molecules-21-01560)]). [175](#B175-molecules-21-01560)] provided highly specific haptomers. As far as the toxic component, the A chain of type 2 RIPs and the type 1 RIPs may represent the perfect effectomer, because they have a low toxicity unless being delivered inside the cell by a carrier. Thus, the so-called \"immunotoxins\", obtained by linking a monoclonal antibody to a RIP, somewhat allow to realize the \"magic bullet\" idea of Ehrlich.
