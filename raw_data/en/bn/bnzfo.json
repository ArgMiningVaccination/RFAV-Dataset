Essential oils are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration - and therein lies the rub. Companies that self-regulate can say (almost) anything about a product without anyone looking askance. What's an informed consumer to do? Look for a company with a good reputation, a rich support network, and one that performs and reports GC/MS (molecular) testing on their oils. Get samples before you buy a large quantity and test them to make sure they'll suit your needs. Does it smell like you expect it to? Does it have the potency and effect you are looking for?How do I use essential oils? Oils that enhance chiropractic care Topically applied, these oils are great to use for muscle spasms: marjoram, clary sage, peppermint, and ylang-ylang. Examples of anti-inflammatory essential oils are blue cypress, blue tansy, cinnamon, copaiba, patchouli, and helichrysum (also good for bruising and swelling). Methyl salicylate is the main constituent in therapeutic wintergreen essential oil and is helpful with arthritis, rheumatism, and muscle, or nerve pain (read the safety information below). Muscle Injury Blend 10 drops German Chamomile 8 drops Lavender 6 drops Marjoram 2 drops Peppermint 3 drops Copaiba Mix in a carrier oil and massage directly on the affected area. There are many uses for all the different essential oils, from household cleaning to bug repellant. Many oils are great to just keep near you to help relax you in tense situations. Just smelling lavender, peppermint, or lemon oil is uplifting and calming. Safety of essential oils Use caution when using essential oils. Never put essential oils in the eyes, ears, or genital region. If this occurs, my recommendation is to use a copious amount of coconut or olive oil on the affected area. Never try to rinse an essential oil out with water. This will just spread the oil, as oil and water do not mix. Before you start: Always test an essential oil before using it. Everybody is unique, so apply a drop on a small area of skin, and wait 3-5 minutes to see if there is a reaction. If not, proceed. People with epilepsy who are pregnant or who are allergic to aspirin should avoid Wintergreen.
