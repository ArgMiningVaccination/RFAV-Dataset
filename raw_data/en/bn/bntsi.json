Coronavirus is spreading from animal market of Wuhan in central China. There are several types of coronavirus but all are not dangerous but this new coronavirus is very dangerous. It is a group of RNA viruses that cause a variety of disease in animal and animal to human. The efficiency of this new coronavirus found in the live animal market of Wuhan in central China, circulate in a range of animals and spread from animal to animal and animal to human also which is called Spillover. Mild symptoms of coronavirus are cough, shortness of breath and severe problems are pneumonia, kidney failure and death also. Basically corona virus effects on immune systems and decrease the immune power. There are no specific treatments or vaccines for this disease still now. So in this condition, people have to maintain immunity and should increase immune power to fight against coronavirus. Only washing hand and wearing a mask are not enough to fight against this virus, people have to modify their daily diet. This article summarizes the immune-boosting therapeutic diet against coronavirus (COVID-19). 2020 The entire world is currently under the grip of a pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV2. The virus caused an initial outbreak in Wuhan, China with affected individuals presenting with viral pneumonia. Early on, in the outbreak, metagenomic RNA sequencing shed light on this novel coronavirus which is an enveloped virus, containing a single stranded RNA and gets it name from the crown like spikes on their surface. With limited availability of antivirals at the beginning of the pandemic and no vaccine; a lot of medications were initially re-purposed to treat COVID-19. As more clinical studies continue to be done, and the availability of antivirals increase, there is a huge need to consider alternative ways and means to boost one's immune system along with preventive measures of social distancing, masking and isolation of infected individuals. Natural plant-based products with medicinal properties along with increased exercise and meditation to relax and de-stress, are vital resources that should be overlooked. 2020 Following research obtained from the previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, we've gained knowledge about the mechanisms of bioactive plant ingredients against the attachment and replication of COVID-19 as well as overshooting immune responses. This could be used for designing COVID-19 trials utilizing bioactive compounds. The receptors for SARS, ACE-2, and CD26 show associations with mechanisms that regulate human senescence. Several functional foods interact with the epigenetic regulation of viral infection and mechanisms of senescence. This review concentrates on the link between bioactive plant ingredients and their activities against mechanisms of viral AND SPIRITUAL RESPONSE THROUGH BIOSPIRITUAL MEDICINE 2020 Journal of Ayurveda and Integrated Medical Sciences | Jan - Feb 2020 | Vol. 5 | Issue 1 2020 Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been recently declared as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by World Health Organization and the virus has now spread beyond the boundaries of countries and continents. At present, no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine is available or recommended to counter the COVID-19, and the potential therapy is still symptomatic. Objective: The primary aim of the study is to review ancient classical literatures and past human treatment protocols of Ayurveda for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and flu like illnesses, so as to provide guidance for the prevention of COVID-19. Methods: Classical Ayurveda and recent modern literature with treatment protocols of Ayurveda for prevention and treatment of flu and infectious diseases were reviewed and COVID-19 has been categorized in four specific situations based on the severity of clinical condition. Total 110 Ayurveda practitioners of different parts of India were participated in the survey. These specific situations were conveyed and described to these participants and their opinions and options were collected through social media platform i.e. WhatsApp or SMS. Results: Recommendation and suggestions received from more than 50% participants were taken into accounts to draft the recommendation for probable preventive and therapeutic regimen for the disease. Conclusion: The results obtained in the study may provide a preventive strategy to the Ayurveda practitioners as well as common people across the globe by increasing the innate immunity of the body to combat COVID-19. However, till today, social distancing is considered as most effective way to stop the spread of COVID-19. Further, pilot study for different group is recommended. RESEARCHERS VIEW ON COVID -19 2020 Use of succulent bio-medicines to control COVID-19 2020 Use of succulent bio-medicines and other succulent bio-healthcare products can bring a dramatic change in initiation, progression as well as expression of symptoms of various diseases among individuals. Succulent parts of some effective medicinal plants in the form of paste or pressure extract can be covered by some digestible capsular materials of biological origin without addition of any synthetic chemical and may be used as preventive oral medicines against COVID-19. Plants having ethnomedicinal reports of having strong immunomodulation and antioxidation activities and plants having role in protection of respiratory organs may be selected for such use to strengthen the immunity power of the people to become refractory to the viral infections. Name of such medicinal plants with relevant parts and previous reports on their related activities, discussion of various steps related with preparation of a design for efficacy based study on the medicines and their dose determination; production, marketing and transport of these medicines up to the patient level; searching of answer of the questions raised against such herbal medicines and discussion of pros and cons of the use of such medicines are added in this book. A brief analysis of possible mechanism of actions of the succulent bio-medicines is also included in this book.

Bangladesh, a South Asian low-middle-income economy, has experienced a demographic and epidemiological transition with rapid urbanization and a gradual increase in life expectancy. It is the seventh most populous country in the world and population of the country is expected to be nearly double by 2050. The increasing burden of communicable diseases in Bangladesh can be attributable to rapid urbanization and nearly 50% of all slum dwellers of the country live in Dhaka division. In 2017, National Rapid Response Team of IEDCR investigated 26 incidents of disease outbreak. The joint survey of the Power and Participation Research center and BRAC Institute of Governance and Development reveals that per capita daily income of urban slum and rural poor drops by 80% due to present countrywide shutdown enforced by the government to halt the spread of COVID-19. 40%-50% of these population took loans to meet the daily expenses. However, the country has just 127,000 hospital beds, 91,000 of them in government-run hospitals. Researchers say, the country's economy is losing BDT 33 billion every day from its service and agriculture sectors during the nationwide shutdown.
