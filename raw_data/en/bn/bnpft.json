The life changing experience I've had with NUCCA has been the best thing to happen since the birth of my child. I've been through the emotional and physical changes that are often unique from patient to patient according to Dr. Ima\u00f1a. I quickly learned after meeting Dr. Ima\u00f1a that NUCCA was what I needed to incorporate positive changes in my life and move forward. I highly recommend the comprehensive initial exam. I didn't realize I had no sense of smell in one nostril before my NUCCA correction. I've since gained some sense of smell throughout my progress...The sky is the limit for your personal experience with NUCCA.\" - Jeffrey "}
