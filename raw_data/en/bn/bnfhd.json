The plan has two sets of benefits: In-Network and Out-of-Network. If You choose an In-Network Provider, You will pay less in out-of-pocket costs, such as Copayments, Deductibles, and Co-insurance. If You use an Out-of-Network Provider, You will have to pay more out-of- pocket costs. If You need to see a Specialist who is within Your Service Area, You can visit any In-Network Specialist including a behavioral health Provider, without a referral. If You need to see a Specialist who is not within Your Service Area, please contact Your PCP to get a referral. But remember, even when a service does not require a referral, or even when You have a referral from Your PCP, some services will still require an authorization. For more information about authorizations, please see the \"Requesting Approval for Benefits\" later in this section. For more information about the plan's Service Area, please see the \"Schedule of Benefits.\" In-Network Services When You use an In-Network Provider or get care as part of an Authorized Service, Covered Services will be covered at the In-Network level. Regardless of Medical Necessity, benefits will be denied for care that is not a Covered Service. We have final authority to decide the Medical Necessity of the service. In-Network Providers include Primary Care Physicians / Providers (PCPs), Specialists (Specialty Care Physicians / Providers - SCPs), other professional Providers, Hospitals, and other Facilities who contract with Us to care for You. Referrals are never needed to visit an In-Network Specialist, including behavioral health Providers. Primary Care Physicians / Providers (PCP) PCPs include general practitioners, internists, family practitioners, and pediatricians. Each Member should choose a PCP who is listed in the Provider directory. Each Member of a family may select a different Primary Care Physician. For example, an internist or general practitioner may be chosen for adults and a pediatrician may be selected for children. If you want to change your PCP, call us or see our website, www.anthem.com. Referrals are not needed to visit an In-Network Specialist, including behavioral health Providers, within your Service Area. If you need to see a Specialist who is outside of your Service Area, please contact your PCP to get a referral. But remember, even when a service does not require a referral, or even when you have a referral from a PCP, some services will still require an authorization. To see a Doctor, call their office: \u00b7Tell them You are an Anthem Member, \u00b7Have your Member Identification Card handy. The Doctor's office may ask You for Your group or Member ID number. \u00b7Tell them the reason for Your visit. When You go to the office, be sure to bring your Member Identification Card with You. For services from In-Network Providers: 1)You will not need to file claims. In-Network Providers will file claims for Covered Services for You. (You will still need to pay any Co-insurance, Copayments, and/or Deductibles that apply.) You may be billed by Your In-Network Provider(s) for any non-Covered Services You get or when You have not followed the terms of this Certificate. 2)Precertification will be done by the In-Network Provider.HOW YOUR COVERAGE WORKS 17 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XWe do not guarantee that an In-Network Provider is available for all services and supplies covered under Your PPO plan.

Out-of-Network Services When You do not use an In-Network Provider, Covered Services are covered at the Out-of-Network level, unless otherwise indicated in this Certificate. For services from an Out-of-Network Provider: 1)In addition to any Deductible and/or Co-insurance/Copayments, the Out-of-Network Provider can charge You the difference between their bill and the plan's Maximum Allowed Amount; 2)You may have higher Cost Sharing amounts (i.e., Deductibles, Co-insurance, and/or Copayments); 3)You will have to pay for services that are not Medically Necessary; 4)You will have to pay for non-Covered Services; 5)You may have to file claims; and 6)You must make sure any necessary Precertification is done. We will not deny or restrict Covered Services just because You get treatment from an Out-of-Network Provider; however, You may have to pay more. We pay the benefits of this Certificate directly to Out-of-Network Providers, if You have authorized an assignment of benefits. An assignment of benefits means You want Us to pay the Provider instead of You. We may require a copy of the assignment of benefits for Our records. These payments fulfill Our obligation to You for those services. How to Find a Provider in the Network There are three ways You can find out if a Provider or Facility is in the network for this Policy. You can also find out where they are located and details about their license or training. \u00b7Go to the directory of In-Network Providers at www.anthem.com .Here You can find lists of Doctors, Providers, and Facilities that participate in Our network. \u00b7Call Member Services to ask for a list of Doctors and Providers that participate in Our network, based on specialty and geographic area. \u00b7Check with Your Doctor or Provider.

You can choose any dentist You want for Your dental care. However, Your dentist choice can make a difference in what benefits are covered and how much You will pay out-of-pocket. You may have more out-of-pocket costs if You use a dentist that is an Out-of-Network dentist. There may be differences in the amount We pay between an In- Network dentist and an Out-of-Network dentist. Please call our Member Services department at (800) 627-0004 for help in finding an In-Network dentist or visit Our website at www.anthem.com/mydentalvision .Please refer to Your Identification Card for the name of the dental program that In-Network Providers have agreed to service when You are choosing an In-Network dentist. Identification Card When You get care, You must show Your Identification Card. Only a Member who has paid the Premium for this coverage has the right to services or benefits under this Certificate. If anyone gets services or benefits which they are not allowed to receive under the terms of this Certificate, he/she must pay for the cost of the services.19 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XREQUESTING APPROVAL FOR BENEFITS Your Certificate includes the process of Utilization Review to decide when services are Medically Necessary or Experimental/Investigational as those terms are defined in this Certificate. Utilization Review aids in the delivery of cost-effective health care by reviewing the use of treatments and, when proper, level of care and/or the setting or place of service that they are performed. A service must be Medically Necessary to be a Covered Service. When level of care, setting or place of service is part of the review, services that can be safely given to You in a lower level of care or lower cost setting/place of care, will not be Medically Necessary if they are given in a higher level of care, or higher cost setting/place of care. Certain Services must be reviewed to determine Medical Necessity in order for You to get benefits. Utilization Review criteria will be based on many sources including medical policy and clinical guidelines. We may decide a service that was asked for is not Medically Necessary if You have not tried other treatments that are more cost effective. IfYou have any questions about the information in this section, You may call the Member Service phone number on the back of Your Identification Card. Coverage for or payment of the service or treatment reviewed is not guaranteed even if We decide Your services are Medically Necessary. For benefits to be covered, on the date You get service: 1.You must be eligible for benefits; 2.Premium must be paid for the time period that services are given; 3.The service or supply must be a Covered Service under Your plan; 4.The service cannot be subject to an Exclusion under Your plan; and 5.You must not have exceeded any applicable limits under Your plan. Types of Reviews \u00b7Pre-service Review - A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage determination which is done before the service or treatment begins or admission date. oPrecertification - A required Pre-service Review for a benefit coverage determination for a service or treatment. Certain Services require Precertification in order for You to get benefits. The benefit coverage review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of Medical Necessity or is Experimental or Investigational as those terms are defined in this Certificate. For admissions following Emergency Care, You, Your authorized representative or Doctor must tell Us within 48 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. For labor/childbirth admissions, Precertification is not needed unless there is a problem and/or the mother and baby are not sent home at the same time. oPredetermination - An optional, voluntary Pre-Service Review request for a benefit coverage determination for a service or treatment if there is a related clinical coverage guideline. The benefit coverage review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of Medical Necessity or is Experimental or Investigational as those terms are defined in this Certificate. \u00b7Continued Stay/Concurrent Review - A Utilization Review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage determination which must be done during an ongoing stay in a facility or course of treatment. Both Pre-Service and Continued Stay/Concurrent Reviews may be considered urgent when, in the view of the treating Provider or any Doctor with knowledge of Your medical condition, without such care or treatment, Your life or health or Your ability to regain maximum function could be seriously threatened or You could be subjected to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without such care or treatment.REQUESTING APPROVAL FOR BENEFITS 20 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XUrgent reviews are conducted under a shorter timeframe than standard reviews. \u00b7Post-service Review - A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage that is conducted after the service or supply has been provided. Post-service reviews are performed when a service, treatment or admission did not need Precertification or did not have a Predetermination review performed. Post-service reviews are done for a service, treatment or admission in which We have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by Us. Who is Responsible for Precertification Typically, In-Network Providers know which services need Precertification and will get any Precertification when needed or ask for a Predetermination, even though it is not required. Your Primary Care Physician and other In-Network Providers have been given detailed information about these procedures and are responsible for meeting these requirements. Generally, the ordering Provider, Facility or attending Doctor (\"requesting Provider\") will get in touch with Us to ask for a Precertification or Predetermination review. However, You may request a Precertification or Predetermination, or You may choose an authorized representative to act on Your behalf for a specific request. The authorized representative can be anyone who is 18 years of age or older. The table below outlines who is responsible for Precertification and under what circumstances. Provider Network StatusResponsibility to get PrecertificationComments In-Network Provider \u00b7The Provider must get Precertification when required Out-of-Network Member\u00b7Member must get Precertification when required (call Member Services). \u00b7Member may be financially responsible for charges/costs related to the service and/or setting in whole or in part if the service and/or setting is found to not be Medically Necessary.

NOTE: For Emergency admissions, You, Your authorized representative or Doctor must tell Us within 48 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. How Decisions are Made We will use our clinical coverage guidelines, such as medical policy, clinical guidelines, and other applicable policies and procedures to help make our Medical Necessity decisions. This includes decisions about Prescription Drugs as detailed in the section \"Prescription Drugs Administered by aREQUESTING APPROVAL FOR BENEFITS 21 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XMedical Provider\". Medical policies and clinical guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions identified as proper medical practice. We reserve the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines from time to time. You are entitled to ask for and get, free of charge, reasonable access to any records concerning Your request. To ask for this information, call the Precertification phone number on the back of Your Identification Card. If You are not satisfied with Our decision under this section of Your benefits, please refer to the \"If You Have a Complaint or an Appeal\" section to see what rights may be available to You. Decision and Notice Requirements We will review requests for benefits according to the timeframes listed below. The timeframes and requirements listed are based on state and federal laws. Where state laws are stricter than federal laws, We will follow state laws. If You live in and/or get services in a state other than the state where Your Certificate was issued, other state-specific requirements may apply. You may call the phone number on the back of Your Identification Card for more details. Type of Review Timeframe Requirement for Decision and Notification Urgent Pre-service Review 72 hours from the receipt of request Non-Urgent Pre-service Review 15 calendar days from the receipt of the request Concurrent/Continued Stay Review when hospitalized at the time of the request72 hours from the receipt of the request and prior to expiration of current certification.

We will notify You and Your Provider of Our decision as required by state and federal law. Notice may be given by one or more of the following methods: verbal, written, and/or electronic. Important Information We may, from time to time, waive, enhance, modify or discontinue certain medical management processes (including utilization management, case management, and disease management) and/or offerREQUESTING APPROVAL FOR BENEFITS 22 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4Xan alternative benefit if, in Our discretion, such change is in furtherance of the provision of cost effective, value based and/or quality services. We may also select certain qualifying Providers to participate in a program that exempts them from certain procedural or medical management processes that would otherwise apply. We may also exempt Your claim from medical review if certain conditions apply. Just because We exempt a process, Provider or claim from the standards which otherwise would apply, it does not mean that We will do so in the future, or will do so in the future for any other Provider, claim or Insured. We may stop or modify any such exemption with or without advance notice. You may find out whether a Provider is taking part in certain programs by checking Your on-line Provider Directory, on-line pre-certification list, or contacting the Member Services number on the back of Your ID Card. We also may identify certain Providers to review for potential fraud, waste, abuse or other inappropriate activity if the claims data suggests there may be inappropriate billing practices. If a Provider is selected under this program, then We may use one or more clinical utilization management guidelines in the review of claims submitted by this Provider, even if those guidelines are not used for all Providers delivering services to plan's Members. Health Plan Individual Case Management Our health plan case management programs (Case Management) help coordinate services for Members with health care needs due to serious, complex, and/or chronic health conditions. Our programs coordinate benefits and educate Members who agree to take part in the Case Management program to help meet their health-related needs. Our Case Management programs are confidential and voluntary and are made available at no extra cost to You. These programs are provided by, or on behalf of and at the request of, Your health plan case management staff. These Case Management programs are separate from any Covered Services You are receiving. If You meet program criteria and agree to take part, We will help You meet Your identified health care needs. This is reached through contact and team work with You and/or Your chosen representative, treating Doctor(s), and other Providers. In addition, We may assist in coordinating care with existing community-based programs and services to meet Your needs. This may include giving You information about external agencies and community- based programs and services. In certain cases of severe or chronic illness or injury, We may provide benefits for alternate care that is not listed as a Covered Service. We may also extend Covered Services beyond the Benefit Maximums of this plan. We will make Our decision case-by-case, if in Our discretion the alternate or extended benefit is in the best interest of the Member and Anthem .A decision to provide extended benefits or approve alternate care in one case does not obligate Us to provide the same benefits again to You or to any other Member. We reserve the right, at any time, to alter or stop providing extended benefits or approving alternate care. In such case, We will notify You or Your representative in writing.

As a result, You should read all sections that might apply to Your claims. You should also know that many Covered Services can be received in several settings, including a Doctor's office, an Urgent Care Facility, an Outpatient Facility or an Inpatient Facility.

Such conditions include but are not limited to, chest pain, stroke, poisoning, serious breathing problems, unconsciousness, severe burns or cuts, uncontrolled bleeding, or seizures and such other acute conditions. Emergency Care means a medical or behavioral health exam done in the Emergency Department of a Hospital, and includes services routinely available in the Emergency department to evaluate an Emergency Medical condition. It includes any further medical or behavioral health exams and treatment required to stabilize the patient. Stabilize , with respect to an emergency medical condition, means: To provide such medical treatment of the condition as may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of the individual from a facility. With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions, the term \"stabilize\" also means to deliver (including the placenta), if there is inadequate time to affect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery or transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child. If You are experiencing an Emergency please call 911 or visit the nearest Hospital for treatment. If You are admitted to the Hospital from the Emergency Room, be sure that You or Your Doctor call Us as soon as possible. We will review Your care to decide if a Hospital stay is needed and how many days You should stay. If You or Your Doctor do not call Us, You may have to pay for services that are determined to be not Medically Necessary. Treatment You get after Your condition has stabilized is not Emergency Care. If You continue to get care from an Out-of-Network Provider, Covered Services will be covered at the Out-of-Network level unless We agree to cover them as an Authorized Service.

The criteria which are called drug edits, may include requirements regarding one or more of the following: \u00b7quantity, dose, and frequency of administration; \u00b7specific clinical criteria (including but not limited to requirements regarding age, test result requirements, and/or presence of a specific condition or disease;) \u00b7specific provider qualifications (including but not limited to REMS certification (Risk, Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies)); \u00b7step therapy requiring one drug or a drug regimen or another treatment be used prior to use of another drug or drug regimen for safety and/or affordability when clinically similar results may be anticipated and one option is less costly than another; \u00b7Use of an Anthem Prescription Drug List (a formulary developed by Anthem which is a list of FDA-approved Drugs that have been reviewed and recommended for use based on their quality and cost effectiveness.) Precertification Precertification may be required for certain Prescription Drugs to make sure proper use and guidelines for Prescription Drug coverage are followed. We will give the results of Our decision to both You and Your Provider. For a list of Prescription Drugs that need precertification, please call the phone number on the back of Your Identification Card. The list will be reviewed and updated from time to time. Including a Prescription Drug or related item on the list does not guarantee coverage under Your plan. Your Provider may check with us to verify Prescription Drug coverage, to find out which drugs are covered under this section and if any drug edits apply. Please refer to the section \"Requesting Approval for Benefits\" for more details. If precertification is denied You have the right to file a Grievance as outlined in the \"If You have a Complaint or an Appeal\" section of this Certificate. Designated Pharmacy Provider Anthem, in its sole discretion, may establish one or more Designated Pharmacy Provider programs which provide specific pharmacy services (including shipment of Prescription Drugs) to Members. An In- Network Provider is not necessarily a Designated Pharmacy Provider. To be a Designated Pharmacy Provider, the In-Network Provider must have signed a Designated Pharmacy Provider Agreement with us. You or Your Provider can contact Member Services to learn which Pharmacy or Pharmacies are part of a Designated Pharmacy Provider program.WHAT IS COVERED 42 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XFor Prescription Drugs that are shipped to You or Your Provider and administered in Your Provider's office, You and Your Provider are required to order from a Designated Pharmacy Provider. A Patient Care Coordinator will work with You and Your Provider to obtain Precertification and to assist shipment to Your Provider's office. We may also require You to use a Designated Pharmacy Provider to obtain Specialty Drugs for treatment of certain clinical conditions such as Hemophilia. We reserve our right to modify the list of Prescription Drugs as well as the setting and/or level of care in which the care is provided to You. Anthem may, from time to time, change with or without advance notice, the Designated Pharmacy Provider for a Drug, if in Our discretion, such change can help provide cost effective, value based and/or quality services. If You are required to use a Designated Pharmacy Provider and You choose not to obtain Your Prescription Drug from a Designated Pharmacy Provider, coverage will be provided at the Out-of-Network level. You can get the list of the Prescription Drugs covered under this section by calling Member Services at the phone number on the back of Your Identification Card or check Our website at www.anthem.com. Therapeutic Substitution Therapeutic substitution is an optional program that tells You and Your Doctors about alternatives to certain prescribed Drugs. We may contact You and Your Doctor to make You aware of these choices. Only You and Your Doctor can determine if the therapeutic substitute is right for You. For questions or issues about therapeutic Drug substitutes, call Member Services at the phone number on the back of Your Identification Card. Prescription Drug Benefit at a Retail or Home Delivery (Mail Order) Pharmacy Your Plan also includes benefits for Prescription Drugs You get at a Retail or Mail Order Pharmacy. We use a Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) to manage these benefits. The PBM has a network of Retail Pharmacies, a Home Delivery (Mail Order) Pharmacy, and a Specialty Pharmacy. The PBM works to make sure Drugs are used properly. This includes checking that Prescriptions are based on recognized and appropriate doses and checking for Drug interactions or pregnancy concerns. Note: Benefits for Prescription Drugs, including Specialty Drugs, which are administered to You by a medical provider in a medical setting (e.g., Doctor's office visit, home care visit, or outpatient Facility) are covered under the \"Prescription Drugs Administered by a Medical Provider\" benefit. Please read that section for important details. Prescription Drug Benefits Prescription Drug benefits may require prior authorization to determine if Your Drugs should be covered. Your In-Network Pharmacist will be told if prior authorization is required and if any additional details are needed for us to decide benefits. Prior Authorization Prescribing Providers must obtain prior authorization for drug edits in order for You to get benefits for certain Drugs. At times, Your Provider will initiate a prior authorization on Your behalf before Your Pharmacy fills Your prescription. At other times, the Pharmacy may make You or Your Provider aware that a prior authorization or other information is needed. In order to determine if the Prescription Drug is eligible for coverage, We have established criteria. The criteria, which are called drug edits, may include requirements regarding one or more of the following: \u00b7quantity, dose, and frequency of administration; \u00b7specific clinical criteria (including but not limited to requirements regarding age, test result requirements, and/or presence of a specific condition or disease); \u00b7specific provider qualifications (including but not limited to REMS certification (Risk, Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies));WHAT IS COVERED 43 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4X\u00b7step therapy requiring one drug or a drug regimen or another treatment be used prior to use of another drug or drug regimen for safety and/or affordability when clinically similar results may be anticipated and one option is less costly than another; \u00b7use of a Prescription Drug List (as described below). You or Your provider can get the list of the Drugs that require prior authorization by calling Member Services at the phone number on the back of Your Identification Card or check Our website at www.anthem.com. The list will be reviewed and updated from time to time. Including a Prescription Drug or related item on the list does not guarantee coverage under Your Plan. Your Provider may check with us to verify Prescription Drug coverage, to find out which drugs are covered under this section and if any drug edits apply. Anthem may, from time to time, waive, enhance, change or end certain Preauthorization and/or alternate benefits, if in Our sole discretion; such change furthers the provision of cost effective, value based and/or quality services. If Prior Authorization is denied You have the right to file a Grievance as outlined in the \"If You have a Complaint or an Appeal\" section of this Certificate. Covered Prescription Drugs To be a Covered Service, Prescription Drugs must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, under federal law, require a Prescription.

If You do not have Your Identification Card, the Pharmacy will charge You the full retail price of the Prescription and will not be able to file the claim for You. You will need to ask the Pharmacy for a detailed receipt and send it to us with a written request for payment. Note: If We determine that You may be using Prescription Drugs in a harmful or abusive manner, or with harmful frequency, Your selection of In-Network Pharmacies may be limited. If this happens, We may require You to select a single In-Network Pharmacy that will provide and coordinate all future pharmacy services. Benefits will only be paid if You use the single In-Network Pharmacy. We will contact You if We determine that use of a single In-Network Pharmacy is needed and give You options as to which In- Network Pharmacy You may use. If You do not select one of the In-Network Pharmacies We offer within 31 days, We will select a single In-Network Pharmacy for You.

Prescription Drug List We also have a Prescription Drug List, (a formulary), which is a list of FDA-approved Drugs that have been reviewed and recommended for use based on their quality and cost effectiveness. Benefits may not be covered for certain Drugs if they are not on the Prescription Drug List. The Drug List is developed by us based upon clinical findings, and where proper, the cost of the Drug relative to other Drugs in its therapeutic class or used to treat the same or similar condition.

If You have a question regarding whether a Drug is on the Prescription Drug Formulary, please refer to Our website at www.anthem.com .

The specific cost sharing features, and the applicable benefit percentages and/or limitations, are outlined in the \"Schedule of Benefits\" section. We consider covered services to be incurred on the date a service is provided. This is important because You must be actively enrolled on the date the service is provided. Maximum Allowed Amount General This provision describes how We determine the amount of reimbursement for Covered Services. Reimbursement for services rendered by In-Network and Out-of-Network Providers is based on Your Certificate's Maximum Allowed Amount for the Covered Service that You receive. Please also see the \"Inter-Plan Programs\" provision for additional information. The Maximum Allowed Amount for this Certificate is the maximum amount of reimbursement We will allow for services and supplies: \u00b7that meet Our definition of Covered Services, to the extent such services and supplies are covered under Your Certificate and are not excluded; \u00b7that are Medically Necessary; and \u00b7that are provided in accordance with all applicable Preauthorization, utilization management or other requirements set forth in Your Certificate. You will be required to pay a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent You have not met Your Deductible or have a Copayment or Co-insurance. In addition, when You receive Covered Services from an Out-of-Network Provider, You may be responsible for paying any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Provider's actual charges. This amount can be significant. When You receive Covered Services from a Provider, We will, to the extent applicable, apply claim processing rules to the claim submitted for those Covered Services. These rules evaluate the claim information and, among other things, determine the accuracy and appropriateness of the procedure and diagnosis codes included in the claim. Applying these rules may affect Our determination of the Maximum Allowed Amount. Our application of these rules does not mean that the Covered Services You received were not Medically Necessary. It means We have determined that the claim was submitted inconsistent with procedure coding rules and/or reimbursement policies. For example, Your Provider may have submitted the claim using several procedure codes when there is a single procedure code that includes all of the procedures that were performed. When this occurs, the Maximum Allowed Amount will be based on the single procedure code rather than a separate Maximum Allowed Amount for each billed code. Likewise, when multiple procedures are performed on the same day by the same doctor or other healthcare professional, We may reduce the Maximum Allowed Amounts for those secondary and subsequent procedures because reimbursement at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount for those procedures would represent duplicative payment for components of the primary procedure that may be considered incidental or inclusive. Provider Network Status The Maximum Allowed Amount may vary depending upon whether the Provider is an In-Network or an Out-of-Network Provider. An In-Network Provider is a Provider who is in the managed network for this specific product or in other closely managed specialty network, or who has a participation contract with Us. For Covered Services performed by an In-Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for Your Certificate is the rate the Provider has agreed with Us to accept as reimbursement for the Covered Services. Because In-NetworkCLAIMS PAYMENTS 70 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XProviders have agreed to accept the Maximum Allowed Amount as payment in full for those Covered Services, they should not send You a bill or collect for amounts above the Maximum Allowed Amount. However, You may receive a bill or be asked to pay all or a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent You have not met Your Deductible or have a Copayment or Co-insurance. Please call Member Services for help in finding an In-Network Provider or visit Our website www.anthem.com . Providers who have not signed any contract with Us and are not in any of Our networks are Out-of- Network Providers, subject to Blue Cross Blue Shield Association rules governing claims filed by certain ancillary Providers. For Covered Services You receive from an Out-of-Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for Your Certificate will be one of the following as determined by Us: 1.An amount based on Our Out-of-Network fee schedule/rate, which We have established in Our discretion, and which We reserve the right to modify from time to time, after considering one or more of the following: reimbursement amounts accepted by like/similar Providers contracted with Us, reimbursement amounts paid by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the same services or supplies, and other industry cost, reimbursement and utilization data; or 2.An amount based on reimbursement or cost information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). When basing the Maximum Allowed Amount upon the level or method of reimbursement used by CMS, Anthem will update such information, which is unadjusted for geographic locality, no less than annually; or 3.An amount based on information provided by a third party vendor, which may reflect one or more of the following factors: (1) the complexity or severity of treatment; (2) level of skill and experience required for the treatment; or (3) comparable Providers' fees and costs to deliver care; or 4.An amount negotiated by Us or a third party vendor which has been agreed to by the Provider. This may include rates for services coordinated through case management; or 5.An amount based on or derived from the total charges billed by the Out-of-Network Provider. Providers who are not contracted for this product, but are contracted for other products with Us are also considered Out-of-Network. For this Certificate, the Maximum Allowed Amount for services from these Providers will be one of the five methods shown above unless the contract between Us and that Provider specifies a different amount. For services rendered outside Anthem Service Area by Out-of-Network Providers, claims may be priced using the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plan's nonparticipating provider fee schedule/rate or the pricing arrangements required by applicable State or federal law. In certain situations, the Maximum Allowed Amount for out of area claims may be based on billed charges, the pricing we would use if the healthcare services had been obtained within the Anthem Service Area, or a special negotiated price. Unlike In-Network Providers, Out-of-Network Providers may send You a bill and collect for the amount of the Provider's charge that exceeds Our Maximum Allowed Amount. You are responsible for paying the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the amount the Provider charges. This amount can be significant. Choosing an In-Network Provider will likely result in lower out-of-pocket costs to You. Please call Member Services for help in finding an In-Network Provider or visit Our website at www.anthem.com . Member Services is also available to assist You in determining Your Certificate's Maximum Allowed Amount for a particular service from an Out-of-Network Provider. In order for Us to assist You, You will need to obtain from Your Provider the specific procedure code(s) and diagnosis code(s) for the services the Provider will render. You will also need to know the Provider's charges to calculate Your out-of- pocket responsibility. Although Member Services can assist You with this pre-service information, the final Maximum Allowed Amount for Your claim will be based on the actual claim submitted by the Provider. For Prescription Drugs, the Maximum Allowed Amount is the amount determined by Us using Prescription Drug cost information provided by the Pharmacy Benefits Manager. Member Cost ShareCLAIMS PAYMENTS 71 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XFor certain Covered Services and depending on Your plan design, You may be required to pay a part of the Maximum Allowed Amount as Your Cost-Share amount (for example, Deductible, Copayment, and/or Co-insurance). Your Cost-Share amount and Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum may vary depending on whether You received services from an In-Network or Out-of-Network Provider. Specifically, You may be required to pay higher cost sharing amounts or may have limits on Your benefits when using Out-of-Network Providers. Please see the \"Schedule of Benefits\" in this Certificate for Your Cost-Share responsibilities and limitations, or call Member Services to learn how this Certificate's benefits or Cost-Share amounts may vary by the type of Provider You use. We will not provide any reimbursement for non-Covered Services. You will be responsible for the total amount billed by Your Provider for non-Covered Services, regardless of whether such services are performed by an In-Network or Out-of-Network Provider. Non-Covered Services include services specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of Your Certificate and services received after benefits have been exhausted. Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, Your day/visit limits. In some instances You may only be asked to pay the lower In-Network Cost-Sharing amount when You use an Out-of-Network Provider. For example, if You go to an In-Network Hospital or Provider Facility and receive Covered Services from an Out-of-Network Provider such as a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist who is employed by or contracted with an In-Network Hospital or Facility, You will pay the In- Network Cost-Share amounts for those Covered Services. However, You also may be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out-of-Network Provider's charge. The following are examples for illustrative purposes only; the amounts shown may be different than this Certificate's Cost-Share amounts; see Your \"Schedule of Benefits\" for Your applicable amounts. Example: Your plan has a Co-insurance Cost-Share of 20% for In-Network services, and 30% for Out-of- Network services after the In-Network or Out-of-Network Deductible has been met. You undergo a surgical procedure in an In-Network Hospital. The Hospital has contracted with an Out-of- Network anesthesiologist to perform the anesthesiology services for the surgery. You have no control over the anesthesiologist used. \u00b7The Out-of-Network anesthesiologist's charge for the service is $1200. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the anesthesiology service is $950; Your Co-insurance responsibility is 20% of $950, or $190 and the remaining allowance from Us is 80% of $950, or $760. You may receive a bill from the anesthesiologist for the difference between $1200 and $950. Provided the Deductible has been met, Your total out-of-pocket responsibility would be $190 (20% Co-insurance responsibility) plus an additional $250, for a total of $440. \u00b7You choose an In-Network surgeon. The charge was $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery is $1500; Your Co-insurance responsibility when an In-Network surgeon is used is 20% of $1500, or $300. We allow 80% of $1500, or $1200. The In-Network surgeon accepts the total of $1500 as reimbursement for the surgery regardless of the charges. Your total out-of- pocket responsibility would be $300. \u00b7You choose an Out-of-Network surgeon. The Out-of-Network surgeon's charge for the service is $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery service is $1500; Your Co-insurance responsibility for the Out-of-Network surgeon is 30% of $1500, or $450 after the Out-of-Network Deductible has been met. We allow the remaining 70% of $1500, or $1050. In addition, the Out- of-Network surgeon could bill You the difference between $2500 and $1500, so Your total out-of- pocket charge would be $450 plus an additional $1000, for a total of $1450. Authorized Services In some circumstances, such as where there is no In-Network Provider available for the Covered Service, We may authorize the In-Network Cost-Share amounts (Deductible, Copayment, and/or Co-insurance) to apply to a claim for a Covered Service You receive from an Out-of-Network Provider. In such circumstances, You must contact Us in advance of obtaining the Covered Service. We also may authorize the In-Network Cost-Share amounts to apply to a claim for Covered Services if You receive Emergency services from an Out-of-Network Provider and are not able to contact Us until after theCLAIMS PAYMENTS 72 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XCovered Service is rendered. If We authorize a Network Cost-Share amount to apply to a Covered Service received from an Out-of-Network Provider, You may also still be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out-of-Network Provider's charge. Please contact Member Services for authorized services information or to request authorization. The following are examples for illustrative purposes only; the amounts shown may be different than this Certificate's Cost-Share amounts; see Your \"Schedule of Benefits\" for Your applicable amounts. Example: You require the services of a specialty Provider; but there is no In-Network Provider for that specialty in Your State of residence. You contact Us in advance of receiving any Covered Services, and We authorize You to go to an available Out-of-Network Provider for that Covered Service and We agree that the In-Network Cost-Share will apply. Your Certificate has a $45 Copayment for Out-of-Network Providers and a $25 Copayment for In-Network Providers for the Covered Service. The Out-of-Network Provider's charge for this service is $500. The Maximum Allowed Amount is $200. Because We have authorized the In-Network Cost-Share amount to apply in this situation, You will be responsible for the In-Network Copayment of $25 and We will be responsible for the remaining $175 of the $200 Maximum Allowed Amount. Because the Out-of-Network Provider's charge for this service is $500, You may receive a bill from the Out-of-Network Provider for the difference between the $500 charge and the Maximum Allowed Amount of $200. Combined with Your In-Network Copayment of $25, Your total out-of-pocket expense would be $325. Deductible Calculation Each family Member's Maximum Allowed Amount for Covered Services is applied to his or her individual Deductible. Once two or more family Members' Maximum Allowed Amounts for Covered Services combine to equal the Family Deductible, then no other individual Deductible needs to be met for that calendar Year. No one person can contribute more than his or her individual Deductible to the family Deductible. The Deductible applies to most Covered Services even those with a zero percent Co-insurance. An example of services not subject to the Deductible is In-Network Preventive Care Services required by law. Generally, Copayments are not subject to and do not apply to the Deductible, however to confirm how Your plan works, please refer to the \"Schedule of Benefits\". The In-Network and Out-of-Network Deductibles are separate and do not apply toward each other. The family Deductible is also applicable for newborn and adopted children for the first 31 day period following birth or adoption if the child is enrolled or not enrolled following the 31 day period. Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum Calculation The Deductible, Co-insurance, and Copayment amounts incurred in a calendar Year apply to the Out-of- Pocket Annual Maximum. The individual Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum applies to each covered family Member. Once two or more covered family Members' Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximums combine to equal the family Out-of Pocket Annual Maximum amount, the Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum will be satisfied for the family for that calendar Year. No one person can contribute more than his or her individual Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum. Once the applicable In-Network Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum is satisfied, no additional In-Network Cost Sharing will be required for the remainder of the calendar Year.CLAIMS PAYMENTS 73 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XOnce the applicable Out-of-Network Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum is satisfied, no additional Cost- Sharing will be required for the remainder of the calendar Year, except for Out-of-Network Human Organ and Tissue Transplant services and any charges over the Maximum Allowed Amount. In-Network and Out-of-Network Co-insurance and Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximums are separate and do not accumulate toward each other. The Out-of-Network Out-of Pocket Annual Maximum does not include Co-insurance for any Out-of- Network Human Organ Tissue Transplant. The Family Membership Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum is also applicable for newborn and adopted children for the first 31-day period following birth or adoption whether or not the child is enrolled following the first 31-day period. Benefit Period Maximum Some Covered Services have a day or visit limit that We will allow during each Benefit Period. This is called the Benefit Period Maximum. When the Deductible applies to a Covered Service that has a limit, the limit will be reduced by the amount applied the Deductible. It does not matter whether or not the Covered Service is paid by Anthem .These limits apply even if You have met the Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum. These limits apply even if some or all of the claims first applied to meet Your Deductible. See the \"Schedule of Benefits\" for services that have a Benefit Period Maximum.

Claims Review for Fraud, Waste and Abuse We have processes to review claims before and after payment to detect fraud, waste, abuse and other inappropriate activity. Members seeking services from Out-of-Network Providers could be balanced billed by the Out-of-Network Provider for those services that are determined to be not payable as a result of these review processes. A claim may also be determined to be not payable due to a Provider's failure to submit medical records with the claims that are under review in these processes. Claim Forms If an Out-of-Network Provider does not bill Us directly, the Member must file the claim. You may visit www.anthem.com for claim forms. If We do not furnish a claim form to the Member within 15 days of the Member's request, the Member may submit written proof of the claim and will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Certificate.

Box 5747 Denver, CO 80217-5747 Payment Innovation Programs We pay Network Providers through various types of contractual arrangements. Some of these arrangements - Payment Innovation Programs (Program(s)) - may include financial incentives to help improve quality of care and promote the delivery of health care services in a cost-efficient manner. These Programs may vary in methodology and subject area of focus and may be modified by Us from time to time, but they will be generally designed to tie a certain portion of a Network Provider's total compensation to pre-defined quality, cost, efficiency or service standards or metrics. In some instances, Network Providers may be required to make payment to Us under the Program as a consequence of failing to meet these pre-defined standards.CLAIMS PAYMENTS 76 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XThe Programs are not intended to affect Your access to health care. The Program payments are not made as payment for specific Covered Health Care Services provided to You, but instead, are based on the Network Provider's achievement of these pre-defined standards. You are not responsible for any Copayment or Coinsurance amounts related to payments made by Us or to Us under the Program(s), and You do not share in any payments made by Network Providers to Us under the Program(s). Relationship of Parties (Us and In-Network Providers) The relationship between Us and In-Network Providers is an independent contractor relationship. In- Network Providers are not agents or employees of ours, nor are We, or any employee of Ours, an employee or agent of In-Network Providers. Your health care Provider is solely responsible for all decisions regarding Your care and treatment, regardless of whether such care and treatment is a Covered Service under this Plan. We shall not be responsible for any claim or demand on account of damages arising out of, or in any manner connected with, any injuries suffered by You while receiving care from any In-Network Provider or for any injuries suffered by You while receiving care from any In-Network Provider's Facilities. Your In-Network Provider's agreement for providing Covered Services may include financial incentives or risk sharing relationships related to the provision of services or referrals to other Providers, including In- Network Providers, Out-of-Network Providers, and disease management programs.

A trained representative will work to clear up any confusion and resolve the Member's concerns. If the Member is not satisfied with the resolution, the Member can file an Appeal as explained under the APPEALS heading in this section. Appeals The Member must request an internal Appeal within 180 calendar days from the date the Member was notified of Our adverse decision. Appeals may be for Preauthorized denials or post-service denials. We will assign an employee to assist the Member in the Appeal process. The Member may send written Appeals to the following address: Grievance and Appeals P.O. Box 10330 Reno, NV 89520-0030 The Appeal must state plainly the reason(s) why the Member disagrees with Our claim decision, Our refusal to authorize or cover a requested service or supply, or how We calculated the benefit. The Member should include any documents not originally submitted with the claim or request for the service or supply and any other information that the Member feels may have a bearing on the decision. Through the Appeal process, the Member can access one level of Appeal, and, where appropriate, independent external review. The Member can designate a representative (e.g., the Member's Physician or anyone else of the Member's choosing) to assist the Member with filing the Appeal. In some instances, We may ask the Member to designate the Member's representative in writing. The Member or the Member's representative can review the Member's Appeal file on request, and can present evidence as part of the Appeal process.IF YOU HAVE A COMPLAINT OR AN APPEAL 78 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XFirst Level Appeal First level Appeals will be reviewed by a review board. The members of the board will not have been involved in the original coverage decision. However, a person that was involved in the original coverage decision, or a health care professional with appropriate experience, may answer questions relating to the Appeal. Unless the Member agrees to a longer period, We will provide a decision in writing within 30 calendar days after receipt of the Appeal. Expedited Appeal A Member or Member's representative has the right to request an expedited Appeal when the timeframes for a standard review could: \u00b7Seriously jeopardize the Member's life or health; \u00b7Jeopardize the Member's ability to regain maximum function; or \u00b7Create an imminent and substantial limitation on the Member's existing ability to live independently if the Member has a disability. Expedited Appeals will be resolved as quickly as the Member's medical circumstances require, but not later than 72 hours after receipt of the request. To request an expedited Appeal, the Member, the Member's Provider or the Member's representative can contact Member Services at the phone number on the Member's Identification Card, fax the request to (775) 448-4277 or send a written request to address above. Independent External Review Appeal IfOurdecision involved making a judgment as to the Medical Necessity, appropriateness, health care setting, level of care or effectiveness of the health care service or treatment the Member requested, the Member may have the right to independent external review, where Ourdecision will be reviewed by health care professionals who have no association with Us.The Member may also request an independent external review when a claim has been denied based upon a determination that the recommended or requested health care service or treatment is Experimental or Investigational treatment. Except as noted below, in order to request an independent external review, the Member must have first completed a first level Appeal. But if We fail to respond to a Complaint or Appeal within thirty (30) calendar days, and the Member has not agreed to an extension, the Member can request an independent external review and the Member will be considered to have exhausted the internal Appeals process. Also, in some instances, We may (but is not required to) agree to an independent external review even if the Member has not exhausted the First level Appeal. The request for Independent External Review must be made to the Nevada Office of the Governor, Consumer Health Assistance within four months after the adverse benefit determination or Our final Appeal determination, whichever is later. Except as mentioned below for expedited external review Appeals, the request must be in writing on a form available through the Office of Consumer Health Assistance, which can be contacted at: 555 E. Washington Ave., Ste. 4800 Las 1-888-333-1597 \u00b7Within 5 business days after receiving the request for external review, the Office of Consumer Health Assistance shall notify the Member, Us and other interested parties that a request for external review has been filed. \u00b7As soon as practical, the Office of Consumer Health Assistance shall assign the Independent Review Organization. \u00b7Within 5 business days after receiving the assignment from the Office of Consumer Health Assistance identifying the Independent Review Organization, We shall provide all documents and materials relating to the adverse determination to the Independent Review Organization.IF YOU HAVE A COMPLAINT OR AN APPEAL 79 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4X\u00b7Within 5 days after receiving notification from the Office of Consumer Health Assistance and the materials from Us, the Independent Review Organization will review the materials and notify the Member if additional information is needed to conduct the review. \u00b7Additional information must be provided within 5 days after receiving the request. \u00b7The Independent Review Organization shall forward a copy of the additional information to Us within 1 business day after receipt. \u00b7Within 15 days of completing the review, the Independent Review Organization shall submit a copy of its determination to the Member. When the Member or the Member's representative request Independent External Review, the Member will be required to authorize the release of any medical records that may be required to be reviewed for the purpose of reaching a decision. Not all requests will be eligible for independent external review. If the Member's claim is determined to be not eligible for independent external review, the Member will be notified of that decision. However, if the Member's denial is eligible for independent external review, an Independent Review Organization will be assigned to conduct the review and issue a decision. Expedited Independent External Review Appeals An expedited review may be requested from the Office of Consumer Health Assistance when: (1) an adverse benefit determination concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay or health care service for which the Member received Emergency Services but has not been discharged from the Facility providing the services or care; or (2) failure to proceed in an expedited manner may jeopardize the life or health of the Member or the Member's ability to regain maximum function; or (3) if the claim has been denied based upon a determination that the service or treatment is Experimental or Investigational, the Member's treating Physician certifies in writing that the recommended service or treatment would be significantly less effective if not promptly initiated. Typically, a Member must complete a first level Appeal prior to requesting external review. However, if the adverse determination involves a denial based on a determination that the service or treatment is Experimental or Investigational and the treating Physician certifies in writing that the service or treatment would be significantly less effective if not promptly initiated, and, if the Member has a medical condition where the time to complete an expedited Appeal would seriously jeopardize the Member's life, health or ability to regain maximum function, then the Member or Member's representative can request expedited independent external review at the same time as requesting an expedited Appeal. If eligible for expedited independent external review, the Independent Review Organization assigned to the Member's case will then determine whether the independent external review should be decided before the Member's expedited Appeal. \u00b7The Office of Consumer Health Assistance shall approve or deny a request for an expedited external review within 72 hours after it receives proof of whether the request qualifies for expedited external review. \u00b7Upon determination that the request is eligible for an expedited external review, Office of Consumer Health Assistance shall assign an Independent Review Organization within 1 working day after approving the request. \u00b7We shall provide all documents and information used to make the adverse determination to the Independent Review Organization within 24 hours after receiving notice from the Office of Consumer Health Assistance assigning the request. \u00b7The Independent Review Organization must complete its review within 48 hours (unless the Member and We agree to a longer period) after receiving the assignment. \u00b7Within 24 hours after completing the assignment, the Independent Review Organization must notify the Member, Physician and Us of its determination by telephone, followed up in writing within 48 hours. The Member or the Member's Provider can request (orally or in writing) a n expedited independent external review. Requests for expedited independent external review must be made to the Office of Consumer Health Assistance within four months of an adverse benefit determination or Our final Appeal determination, whichever is later. The Office of Consumer Health Assistance can be reached at:IF YOU HAVE A COMPLAINT OR AN APPEAL 80 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4X555 E.

Not all requests will be eligible for independent external review. If the Member's claim is determined to be not eligible for independent external review, the Member will be notified of that decision. However, if the Member's denial is eligible for independent external review, an Independent Review Organization will be assigned to conduct the review and issue a decision. Appeals Involving Independent Medical Evaluations If We require an independent medical, dental or chiropractic evaluation to make a final determination of benefits or care, We may require the Member to submit to the independent evaluation. The evaluation will be conducted by a Physician, dentist or chiropractor who is certified to practice in the same field of practice as the primary treating Physician, dentist or chiropractor, or who is formally educated in that field. The independent evaluation must include a physical examination of the patient, unless deceased, and a personal review of all X-rays and reports prepared by the primary treating Physician, dentist or chiropractor. A certified copy of all reports of findings must be sent to the primary treating Physician, dentist or chiropractor and the Member within 10 working days after the evaluation. If the Member disagrees with the findings of the evaluation, the Member must submit an Appeal to Us, pursuant to the procedure for binding arbitration as established by the American Arbitration Association, within 30 days after receipt of the findings of the evaluation. Upon receipt of an Appeal, We will notify the primary treating Physician, dentist or chiropractor in writing. We will not limit or deny coverage for care related to a disputed claim that requires an independent medical evaluation while the dispute is in arbitration. However, if We prevail in the arbitration, the primary treating Physician, dentist or chiropractor may not recover any payment from Us, the Subscriber or the patient for services that the Physician, dentist or chiropractor provided to the patient after receiving written notice from Us.

Removal of Members A Subscriber may terminate the enrollment of any Member from the plan. If this happens, no benefits will be provided for Covered Services received after the Member's termination date. Refund of Premium Upon Termination, We shall return promptly the unearned portion of any Premium paid.88 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XIMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR COVERAGE Insurance Premiums How Premiums are Established and Changed Premiums are the monthly charges the Member must pay Us to establish and maintain coverage. The Premium for this Certificate may change subject to, and as permitted by, applicable law. Prior to a Premium change, We will send out written notification 60 days in advance of such change. We are not required to notify the Member of a Premium increase when a Member enters into a new age bracket. If the Member's Premium is paid beyond the Effective Date of the change, We may require the Member to pay an additional Premium or accept a refund, whichever is necessary. If the age of the Member is misstated, all amounts payable for the correct age shall be adjusted and billed to the Member. It is the Subscriber's responsibility to pay Premiums to Us. Under no circumstances will Premium payments made on any Member's behalf or any Member be accepted from a Physician, a Hospital or any other Provider of the Subscriber's health care services or any federal or State agency. The receipt of a Premium payment from such a Provider or agency may result in termination of the Subscriber's coverage. Administrative Fee An administrative fee of $20 will be charged for any check, automatic deduction, or Electronic Funds Transfer which is returned or dishonored by the financial institution as non-payable to Us for any reason. Note: We may offer incentives to Members who enroll to automatically pay Premiums electronically instead of receiving a paper bill every month. The Subscriber must notify Us of an address change by submitting an Enrollment Application/Change Form, visiting Our website at www.anthem.com, or calling Our Member Services department. Failure to receive a Premium notice due to an unreported address change (or any other reason) does not relieve the Member from the responsibility to pay required Premiums by the Premium due date. Premium Not Received on Time If Premiums are not paid within the Grace Period , coverage under this Certificate will automatically terminate. Where the law allows, and subject to the Grace Period section of this Certificate, termination may be effective retroactively to the last date of the period for which Premium has been paid. We will not pay for any services provided to Members on or after the date of termination. All claims paid after termination will be retroactively adjusted. We will mail written notice of any intention not to renew this Certificate beyond the period for which the Premium has been accepted not less than 30 days prior to the Premium due date. We will mail the notice to the Subscriber's latest address in Our Membership records. A Grace Period will be granted for the payment of each Premium falling due after the first Premium, during which Grace Period the Certificate shall continue in force. Care Coordination We pay In-Network Providers in various ways to provide Covered Services to You. For example, sometimes We may pay In-Network Providers a separate amount for each Covered Service they provide. We may also pay them one amount for all Covered Services related to treatment of a medical condition. Other times, We may pay a periodic, fixed pre-determined amount to cover the costs of Covered Services. In addition, We may pay In-Network Providers financial incentives or other amounts to help improve quality of care and/or promote the delivery of health care services in a cost-efficient manner, or compensate In-Network Providers for coordination of Member care. In some instances, In-NetworkIMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR COVERAGE 89 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XProviders may be required to make payment to Us because they did not meet certain standards. You do not share in any payments made by In-Network Providers to Us under these programs. Catastrophic Events In case of fire, flood, war, civil disturbance, court order, strike or other cause beyond Our control, We may be unable to process Member claims on a timely basis. No legal action or lawsuit may be taken against Us due to a delay caused by any of these events. Changes to the Certificate No agent or employed by Us may change this Certificate by giving incomplete or incorrect information, or by contradicting the terms of this Certificate. Any such situation will not prevent Us from administering this Certificate in strict accordance with its terms. Oral or written statements do not supersede the terms of this Certificate. Continuity of Care If Your In-Network Provider leaves Our network because We have terminated their contract without cause, and You are in active treatment, You may be able to continue seeing that Provider for a limited period of time and still receive In-Network benefits. \"Active treatment\" includes: 1.An ongoing course of treatment for a life-threatening condition. 2.An ongoing course of treatment for a serious acute condition, (examples include chemotherapy, radiation therapy and post-operative visits). 3.The second or third trimester of pregnancy and through the postpartum period. 4.An ongoing course of treatment for a health condition for which the Physician or health care Provider attests that discontinuing care by the current Physician or Provider would worsen Your condition or interfere with anticipated outcomes. An \"ongoing course of treatment\" includes treatments for mental health and substance use disorders. In these cases, You may be able to continue seeing that Provider until treatment is complete, or for 90 days, whichever is shorter. If You wish to continue seeing the same Provider, You or Your Doctor should contact Member Services for details. Any decision by Us regarding a request for Continuity of Care is subject to the Appeals Process. Fraudulent Insurance Acts It is unlawful to knowingly provide false, incomplete or misleading facts or information to an insurance company for the purpose of defrauding or attempting to defraud the company. Penalties may include imprisonment, fines, denial of insurance and civil damages. Any insurance company or agent of an insurance company who knowingly provides false, incomplete or misleading facts or information to a policyholder or claimant for the purpose of defrauding or attempting to defraud the policyholder or claimant with regard to a settlement or award payable from insurance proceeds shall be reported to the Nevada Division of Insurance within the Department of Business and Industry. Insurance fraud results in cost increases for health care coverage. Members can help decrease these costs by doing the following: \u00b7Be wary of offers to waive Copayments or Deductible. This practice is usually illegal. \u00b7Be wary of mobile health testing labs. Ask what the insurance company will be charged for the tests. \u00b7Always review the Explanation of Benefits received from Us. If there are any discrepancies, call Our Member Services department. \u00b7Be very cautious about giving the Member's health insurance coverage information over the phone. If fraud is suspected, Members should contact Our Member Services department.IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR COVERAGE 90 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XWe reserve the right to recoup any benefit payments paid on behalf of a Member if the Member has committed fraud or material misrepresentation in applying for coverage in or receiving or filing for benefits. Medical Policy and Technology Assessment We review and evaluate new technology according to its technology evaluation criteria developed by its medical directors. Technology assessment criteria are used to determine the Experimental / Investigational status or Medical Necessity of new technology. Guidance and external validation of Our medical policy is provided by the Medical Policy and Technology Assessment Committee (MPTAC) which consists of approximately 20 doctors from various medical specialties including Our medical directors, doctors in academic medicine and doctors in private practice. Conclusions made are incorporated into medical policy used to establish decision protocols for particular diseases or treatments and applied to Medical Necessity criteria used to determine whether a procedure, service, supply or equipment is covered. Member's Obligation to Supply Information and Cooperate The Member must provide Us with any information We consider necessary to determine whether, or to what extent, services are covered under this Certificate, or to carry out the other provisions of this Certificate. The Member agrees to cooperate at all times (including while they are hospitalized) by allowing Us access to their medical records to investigate claims and verify information provided in the Nevada Individual Enrollment Application. No Withholding of Coverage for Necessary Care We do not compensate, reward or incent, financially or otherwise, Our associates for inappropriate restrictions of care. We do not promote or otherwise provide an incentive to employees or Physician reviewers for withholding benefit approval for Medically Necessary services to which the Member is entitled. Utilization Review and benefit coverage decision making is based on appropriateness of care and service and the applicable terms of this Certificate. We do not design, calculate, award or permit financial or other incentives based on the frequency of: (1) denials of Authorization for coverage; (2) reductions or limitations on Hospital lengths of stay, medical services or charges; or (3) telephone calls or other contacts with health care Providers or Members. Notice of Privacy Practices We are committed to protecting the confidential nature of Members' medical information to the fullest extent of the law.

The purpose of these incentives include, but is not limited to, making You aware of cost effective benefit options or services, helping You achieve Your best health, encouraging You to update Member-related information and encouraging You to enroll automatically to pay Premiums electronically. These incentives may be offered in various forms such as retailer coupons, gift cards, health related merchandise, and discounts on fees or Member Cost-shares. Acceptance of these incentives is voluntary as long as Anthem offers the incentives program. We may discontinue an incentive for a particular covered program or service at any time. If You have any questions about whether receipt of an incentive or retailer coupon results in taxable income to You, We recommend that You consult Your tax advisor. Refusal to Follow Recommended Treatment If a Member refuses treatment that has been recommended by Our In-Network Provider, the Provider may decide that the Member's refusal compromises the Provider-patient relationship and obstructs the provision of proper medical care. Providers will try to render all necessary and appropriate professional services according to a Member's wishes, when they are consistent with the Provider's judgment. If a Member refuses to follow the recommended treatment or procedure, the Member is entitled to see another Provider of the same specialty for a Second Opinion. The Member can also pursue the Appeal process. Reserve Funds No Member is entitled to share in any reserve or other funds that may be accumulated or established by Us, unless We grant a right to share in such funds. Right of Recovery and Adjustment Whenever payment has been made in error, We will have the right to recover such payment from You or, if applicable, the Provider or otherwise make appropriate adjustments to claims. In most instances, such recovery or adjustment activity shall be limited to the calendar Year in which the error is discovered. We have oversight responsibility of compliance with Provider and vendor contracts. We may enter into a settlement or compromise regarding enforcement of these contracts and may retain any recoveries made from a Provider or vendor resulting from these audits if the return of the overpayment is not feasible. Additionally, We have established recovery and adjustment policies to determine which recoveries and adjustments are to be pursued, when to incur costs and expenses and settle or compromise recovery or adjustment amounts. We will not pursue recoveries for overpayments or adjustments for underpayments if the cost of the activity exceeds the overpayment or underpayment amount. We may not give You notice of overpayments made by us or You if the recovery method makes providing such notice administratively burdensome. Sending Notices All Subscriber notices are considered sent to and received by the Subscriber when deposited in the United States mail with postage prepaid and addressed to either: The Subscriber at the latest address in Our membership records. Voluntary Clinical Quality Programs We may offer additional opportunities to assist You in obtaining certain covered preventive or other care (e.g., well child check-ups or certain laboratory screening tests) that You have not received in the recommended timeframe. These opportunities are called voluntary clinical quality programs. They are designed to encourage You to get certain care when You need it and are separate from Covered Services under Your plan. These programs are not guaranteed and could be discontinued at any time.IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR COVERAGE 92 NV_OFF_PPO_(1/17) 1G4XWe will give You the choice and if You choose to participate in one of these programs, and obtain the recommended care within the program's timeframe, You may receive incentives such as gift cards or retailer coupons, which we encourage You to use for health and wellness related activities or items .

This includes filing an Appeal with the Nevada Division of Industrial Relations.

Services and supplies resulting from work-related illness or injury are not a benefit under this Certificate , except for corporate officers who have opted out of Workers' Compensation coverage, pursuant to State or federal law, prior to the illness or injury.
