Therapies include diet and lifestyle counselling, nutraceutical medicine, acupuncture, botanical medicine, ect. Massage Therapy Massage therapy consists primarily of hands-on treatment of the soft tissues and muscles of the body specifically for the purpose of relaxation, stress relief and improved health. Physiotherapy The role of the physiotherapist is to educate patients on corrective exercises and promote recovery through hands-on therapy. Physical therapy and rehabilitation are important components in the healing process particularly after an injury. Acupuncture Acupuncture is an alternative medicine methodology that treats patients through the use of thin, sterile, solid needles. The needles are inserted into traditional acupuncture points to enhance the body's nervous system response by correcting imbalances in the flow of 'Qi'.
