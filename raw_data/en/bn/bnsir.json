Ayurveda recommends the use of sesame oil and A. taila as a part of daily routine (dinacharya) for oral gargling and transnasal application (Nasya) for preventing upper respiratory tract infections. Recent studies on COVID-19 have elucidated the activity of certain fatty acids in restricting viral binding. Based on the evidence gathered from in-silico, pre-clinical, and pharmacological studies as well as references from classical textbooks of Ayurveda, this article infers that the transnasal application of sesame oil and/or A. taila could provide resilience/protection to the respiratory system. It can act as a 'biological mask' to prevent respiratory infections like COVID-19. Detailed pharmacological study can give fuller confirmation of our informed \"inference\" that A. taila offers a cost-effective intervention for the prevention of COVID-19 like infections of the upper respiratory tract.

The outcome of pregnancy i.e. childbirth is a natural but at the same time very complex process. The time taken for normal labor in primigravida is 12h-14 h and latent phase of labor is expected not to exceed more than 8 h. Thus, any intervention that augments and eases labor is well accepted for mother and fetus. Apana Vayu is having pivotal role in regulating the process of labor. A woman, aged 27 years, primigravida with full term pregnancy and pain in lower abdomen for 7 h visited Rajiv Gandhi Govt. Post Graduate Ayurvedic College & Hospital, Paprola. She was given a soap water enema and kept under a close observation for 2 days. There was neither significant progress of labor nor the pain subsided with afore mentioned management. On the third day, she was given Matra Basti of Eranda Taila. This showed the therapeutic effect on progress of labor and ultimately safe delivery of baby. To evaluate any kind of fetal distress, APGAR score of neonate and umbilical cord arterial blood was collected for determination of pH value. Present case suggests an example to manage delayed labor with Eranda Taila Matra Basti without any altered fetal parameters and fetal distress.

The condition is very common in women and negatively affects their quality of life. The aging process reflects in the form of structural and functional weakness of the pelvic floor which leads to pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD). The strength and endurance of the Pelvic floor muscles (PFM) decrease significantly by these dysfunctions. In the present study, Pelvic floor strength (PFS) and endurance were assessed with the help of a perineometer. The patient was diagnosed with cystocele, uterine prolapse and weak PFS was assessed with the Perineometer. Patient was treated with Ayurvedicsthanika chikitsa (local treatment)- Yoni abhyanga (vaginal massage) and improvement in PFS was assessed after treatment. The present article aims to assess the pre and post-outcome results of PFM by using the objective tool perineometer. Seven days of yoni abhyanga along with oral medication were given and on follow-up after three months, the patient showed increased strength and endurance on the perineometer. Early diagnosis and management of the PFD will help to improve the QoL (Quality of Life) and prevent further deterioration of PFS.

In this review, an attempt has been made to compile all such clinical research works carried out on Vrana Ropana (wound healing). A grey literature of post graduate (PG) and Doctorate (PhD) researches on Vrana Ropana from various Ayurvedic institutes were collected in the form of soft or/and hard copy as per the availability. The studies were found to be a combination of drug/drug formulations and various procedures mentioned under Shashti Upakramas in Sushruta Samhitha. The use of the Lepa (topical application), Avachoornana (sprinkling of medicated powder), Raktamokshana (bloodletting) like Jalauokavacharana (medicinal leech application) and Kshalana (therapeutic procedure in which the wounds are cleansed with medicated liquids) were cross reviewed from various research works. All these works were mainly targeted to find the best Shodhana (cleaning) and Ropana (healing) drugs for the treatment of wound. On the basis of the clinical evidences on the same drug with positive outcomes, one should further try it in multi-centres and develop that drug for wound management. Hence this review study would help to know the previous research works carried out on wound healing and design further trials on specific parameters or treatment protocol as a whole with local as well systemic management of wounded patients.

Various types of fractures, methods of reduction, and healing have been explained in the classical Ayurveda texts. These techniques are scientific and time-tested. This paper aims to report the successful management of Colles fracture case using Ayurveda and modern techniques with the use of Murivenna (an oil-based herbal formulation mentioned in the contemporary texts of Ayurveda), half-cast POP, and aluminum splinted bandage along with the internal medicine AbhaGuggulu. A 75-year-old moderately built woman diagnosed with Colles fracture was treated with a closed manipulative reduction technique followed by a below-elbow half-cast POP and an aluminum splint. Murivenna was poured anteriorly to the fractured site and Abha Guggulu was administered internally. Re-bandaging was done on the 7th day and 21st day. The bandage was removed on the 35th day. The patient's condition improved considerably with a good range of wrist movements and then she was advised to commence rehabilitation. This integrative method, adhering to Ayurvedic principles and modern techniques is unique, patient-friendly, and without adverse events. [Guru shishya relationship and lasting legacy of Yoga.

It is one of the main materials used in herbo-mineral pharmaceutics in Ayurveda. However, for Ayurvedic pharmaceutical preparations, the purity of sulphur is crucial in avoiding any harmful reactions and to enhance the medicinal quality. Therefore, it is subjected to a process called 'gandhaka shodhana' using cow's milk, ghee or occasionally plant extracts. The plant, Eclipta alba (L.) Hassak, containing many bioactive compounds, is one of the extracts known to be used in the 'shodhana' process of sulphur. However, in comparison to the laboratory purification method of sulphur neither the effect of this 'shodhana' process in removing impurities from sulphur nor its effect on the structure and morphology of sulphur has been evaluated.

Traumatic inflictions may lead to the formation of scar tissue around the bladder neck which makes this tubular structure narrower than the normal. It causes urinary flow obstruction associated with pain, heaviness, hesitancy and incomplete bladder emptying. In Ayurveda, such features have been described under the context of Vatakundalika and Mutrotsanga under the chapter of Sushruta Samhita. Bladder neck resection surgery is considered as the surgical treatment in this case but the recurrence rate is high. In Ayurvedic texts, Uttarabasti has been indicated in the treatment of various urinary disorders. A 70-year-old male patient visited the Outdoor Patient Department (OPD) of hospital of National Institute of Ayurveda (NIA), Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; with chief complaints of difficulty in micturition, pain during micturition along with poor stream of urine for the last 2.5 years. He had past history of surgical intervention of Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) for prostatomegaly and transurethral incision of bladder neck (TUI-BN) of bladder neck contracture. This was diagnosed as a case of recurrent urinary bladder neck contracture and was managed with Uttarabasti of Bala-Ashwagandhadi Taila and oral Ayurvedic medicines with encouraging results. Ayurveda may prove helpful in such type of recurrent and recalcitrant cases and the intervention of Uttarabasti Karma is specifically indicated for the same.

CTN occurs due to neurovascular compression of the Trigeminal nerve presenting with recurrent pain episodes. This case reports the effect of Ayurveda interventions on CTN. Thirty-nine-year-old male patient with pain on the right side of the face for two years presented to the National Institute of Ayurveda, Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. The pain was distributed on the right side of the upper lip, cheek, and chin. Paroxysms of pain appeared at the interval of 1-2 h and were lasting of 1-2 min. The case was diagnosed with the help of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as right-side classical trigeminal neuralgia due to indentation of the vascular loop of the right superior cerebellar artery. The patient had a treatment history of two years with allopathic medicine, and he sought Ayurveda treatment due to recurrence and excessive pain. The patient was given Ayurvedic interventions (oral medication, Nasya, Kavalagraha, and Gandusha) for three months. The improvement were observed on the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and Short Form -36 questionnaire (SF-36) for quality of life. After three months of the treatment, the VAS scale for pain and the HADS scale for anxiety and depression showed marked improvement. Improvement in all the domains of SF-36 was observed, with a total percentage improvement from 10.7% to 83.2%. Observations of this case highlight the usefulness of Ayurveda interventions, i.e., Oral medication, Nasya, Kavalagraha, and Gandusha, in reducing the acute paroxysms of pain in Classical TN and improving the quality of life of CTN patients.

It was recorded in Susruta Samhita that there were 107 marma points in human body, which located at the anatomical site where muscles, veins, ligaments, bones and joints meet together and were regarded as seats of life energy. While acupoints in Traditional Chinese Medicine is defined as having the similar position as marma points, and also the function of regulating vital energy, these body points have been constantly combined with acupuncture technique, which encouraged doctors to stimulate applicable acupoints in order to relief pain and treat diseases. Given the similarity of their location and regulation of vital energy, this paper further conducted a systematic comparison of their origins, general features and clinical applications based on literature of Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine. The results indicated that the main difference existed in their origin, with marma from the battlefield culture of ancient India and acupoints from medical experience of ancient Chinese. In general features, they showed diverse characteristics of medical theories through classified methods. As for clinical applications, acupoints have always been closely related to medical science in the whole progression, yet marma points were gradually endowed with medical functions. Overall, these body points appeared independently and conveyed the different body views bred by two civilizations. Through cross-region comparison, people's understanding of each traditional medicine and cultural connotation behind it could be deepened, which assisted to achieve the cooperation and innovation of traditional medicine.

Although Allergic Rhinitis is not a life-threatening disease, the symptoms of Allergic Rhinitis can be particularly bothersome and disruptive to a patient's sleep and overall quality of life. The coexistence of other allergic conditions like Asthma is very common. No satisfactory treatment is available in modern medicine for this disease. There is a need to search for satisfactory treatment available in another medical system. We present a case of Allergic Rhinitis that was successfully treated with Ayurvedic medicines. Allergic Rhinitis is characterized by watery nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, nasal mucosal pallor, sneezing, and itching in the eyes, palate, and pharynx. A 18-year-old female patient presented with complaints of sneezing (80-100/day), rhinorrhea (watery discharge from nose), heaviness in the head region, weakness, and loss of concentration hampering daily life activity for one year. The patient's clinical findings and symptoms were suggestive of Allergic Rhinitis, which is of perennial type. According to Ayurveda diagnosis was done as Vata-Kaphaj Pratishyay. Rajanyadi Churna was given to the patient for 15 days along with Guduchi Kwath (Guduchi Mahatiktak Ghrita. The patient experienced a reduction in all the symptoms after 15 days. Allergy markers i.e. Absolute Eosinophil Count reduced to 360 cells/cu mm from 704 cells/cu mm and eosinophils in CBC reduced to 4.1%. The primary complaint of sneezing was significantly reduced to 3-4 times/day after completing the treatment. Ayurvedic therapeutic interventions other than Nasya (Nasal oleation), and Dhoompana (medicated smoke) modalities showed encouraging results in managing Allergic Rhinitis in a short duration of time. This approach may be taken into consideration for further treatment and research work for Allergic Rhinitis.

Complete cure of the highly infiltrative AA is uncommon, and reports of positive outcome in cases of partial resection of AA are rare. Further, integrative approaches to the management of AA remain underexplored. This paper contributes to the limited literature in this domain by presenting a case that was successfully treated through integrative conventional and Ayurvedic interventions. A patient diagnosed with AA in the left parieto-occipital lobe underwent partial lesion resection followed by post-operative radiation and chemotherapy. The patient was given a conservative post-surgical life expectancy of two years, and was referred to an Ayurveda hospital for further treatment. The Ayurvedic intervention was focussed on redressal of radiation and chemotherapy side-effects, improvement of quality of life, and improving the patient's strength and immunity. Following this novel integrative model of care, the patient was able to resume all personal and professional routines, and a contrast MRI revealed absence of residual lesion allowing the patient to outlive his initial prognosis by several years till date. We posit that the findings of this report merit further examination in the interest of potential improvements to existing models of care.

Since antibiotics are frequently used to treat DFU, managing the condition has proven to be extremely challenging and may eventually lead to the development of antibiotic resistance. Scientists from around the world are working to develop an alternative solution to the problem of drug resistance by exploring complementary and alternative medicines that may be obtained from natural sources. Hence, the review aims to comprehensively report the information on the natural treatments and therapy used to manage DFU. All of the information described in the current study was gathered from electronic scientific resources, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Springer Link. Findings from the current review revealed the pre-clinical and clinical utility of 18 medicinal plants, 1 isolated compound, 7 polyherbal formulations including herbal creams, a few micronutrients including vitamins and minerals, insect products such as propolis, honey and, Maggot debridement therapy for the treatment and management of DFU. Natural therapies possess better efficacy, low cost, and shorter duration of treatment when compared with the conventional treatments; hence, all information made available about them is crucial to alter the direction of treatment. Furthermore, the data presented in this review are up to date on the potential efficacy of natural complementary medicines for alleviating DFU problems in in vitro and in vivo tests, as well as clinical studies.

There are no many published literature available documenting the effectiveness of Ayurveda intervention on diabetes mellitus. This report is about a case in which successful reversal of diabetes mellitus was achieved in a patient who reported with glycosylated Hb percentage (HbA1C) as high as 14.87%. The patient had classical symptoms of diabetes mellitus viz. excessive thirst, fatigue and frequent urination. His fasting blood glucose level was 346 mg/dl and post prandial glucose level of 511 mg/dl. Further more his HbA1C was as high as 14.87%, thus diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Based on his specific clinical symptoms the patient was diagnosed with kaphaja prameha. Treatment was given according to classical Ayurveda intervention for kaphaja prameha. The patient responded well to the treatment. His HbA1C reduced to 6.05% in a span of eight months. The case report shows the effectiveness of Ayurvedic intervention in diabetes mellitus. It is limited in its scope as it is a case report, nevertheless this can be taken up as an information that may lead to new research and advances in the field of clinical practice in Ayurveda.

The highly contagious nature of the disease compelled scientific communities and related organisations to hasten vaccine development and supplies. Well-timed international collaborations resulted in quicker development of varied forms of vaccines against COVID-19. Prospective observational studies and systematic reviews on vaccine trials reported their safety and efficacies.
