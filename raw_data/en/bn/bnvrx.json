While the development of COVID-19 vaccines has proceeded rapidly to help save lives, none of the steps in place to test vaccines for safety have been skipped. Two of those vaccines, one from Pfizer and one from Moderna, tested their vaccines over 70,000 people altogether from many walks of life and ethnicities to make sure they were safe and effective. People enrolled in these clinical trials, were either given the real vaccine or a salt-water solution (placebo). After following the groups for a period of time, scientists were able to show that the groups that received real vaccine were protected against COVID-19. The two vaccines were around 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 without causing serious side effects. There are two doses. Both of the vaccines currently available require 2 shots several weeks apart. Johnson & Johnson is only one dose. Once you receive your first dose, we will schedule your second dose and it will be upon the county distribution availability. We are currently vaccinating patients who are 6 months and older, following local, State, Manufacturer, and CDC guidelines. Pfizer is now being offered at all CHSI locations. Currently all CHSI locations are offering the COVID-19 vaccine. Schedule your appointment online here. As we continue to vaccinate our patients, the county regulates the availability of the amount we receive. When we get through each batch of vaccinations we can then order more. We do anticipate continually getting more doses, if available by the county. Yes, you are still eligible. The current CDC recommendations are to postpone vaccinations for 90 days after the infection to prioritize those who do not have natural immunity from a previous COVID-19 disease. Yes! Both COVID-19 and the virus that causes flu will be spreading this winter. The Flu shot only protects you from the flu but it's important to get your vaccine to avoid getting both COVID-19 and flu at the same time. Also, protecting yourself against flu will help keep our hospitals more open to help those with COVID-19 as it spreads through the winter. The flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine may have to be given a few weeks apart so talk to your doctor about the timing of when to get your flu vaccine. It is possible to have an allergic reaction to any vaccine or medication including the COVID-19 vaccine. Serious allergic reactions from the COVID-19 vaccine are very rare but talk to your doctor before getting your vaccine if you have a history of severe allergic reactions. Our clinical staff is trained to administer the COVID-19 vaccine, and will monitor all patients for side effects for at least 15 minutes after receiving their vaccine. The mild side effects identified with the COVID-19 vaccine may include, but not limited to: pain at the injection site, tiredness, headaches, muscle pain, and fever.
