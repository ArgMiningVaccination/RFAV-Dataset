And, while it's great to avoid plastic that includes [PVC](https://theconsciousinsider.com/is-pvc-toxic/#how-pvc-releases-toxins-into-the-environment), [BPA](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/5-ways-reduce-your-exposure-toxic-bpa#:~:text=It%20disrupts%20hormones%2C%20affects%20brain,disease%20and%20other%20serious%20disorders.), [BPS](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2020/12/harmful-bpa-replacements-contaminate-store-receipts#table), and [phthalates](https://www.forceofnatureclean.com/avoid-the-common-toxin-phthalates/), even plastics that don't include these compounds may still be [problematic](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateharrison/2013/11/14/why-i-wont-buy-bpa-free-baby-products/#2b0fcf3135cb). One of the biggest issues is that plastic can [release toxins when heated](http://time.com/4229503/plastic-in-microwave-is-it-safe/), which is particularly scary when you think about heating food and serving it to kids on plastic plates or cups or even running it through a dishwasher cycle where it's washed hot and dried with a heater. The bottom line: if you must use plastic, don't heat it and wash it by hand in warm water with mild (non-toxic!) soap and dry with a cloth. Or do one better and check out some of these great alternatives. Our Top 4 Choices for Non-Toxic Dinnerware for Kids1. Wood Pros: Wood is a sustainable, environmentally-friendly alternative that's not easily broken by rambunctious kiddos. Cons: Because the water content in wood will swell when heated, you can't toss these in the microwave or the dishwasher. Quick tip: keep a glass or ceramic bowl on hand for safe microwave heating and then transfer to the wooden plates for eating. Our Favorites [Bambu](https://www.bambuhome.com)makes adorable plates, utensils and teethers and are committed to safe-working environments and labor laws. [Avanchy](https://avanchy.com/)combines gorgeous wood designs with silicone accents to make them as functional as they are beautiful. 2. Plant-Based Pros: Who knew you could make kid's dinnerware from corn, sugar beets and bamboo? Plant-based products are free of toxic chemicals, such as BPA and Phthalates. In addition to being made from sustainable materials, they use an environmentally-friendly manufacturing process, requiring 52% less energy to produce vs. traditional PET plastics. Cons: Because they're comprised of a combination of renewable plant materials - like corn, beets, and bamboo - it's hard to guarantee the specific breakdown of elements in each item. Our FavoritesWe love [Repurpose](https://repurpose.com), a company also founded by a mom to keep kids and our earth healthy. Their kid's dinnerware is soooooo cute and made entirely from plants. It's free from BPAs, Phthalates, PVC, or PBDE and is safe to us in your dishwasher and microwave. 3. Stainless Pros: High quality, 304 grade stainless steel is a safe and durable choice for non-toxic dinnerware. Unless you have an allergy or a sensitivity to nickel or chromium, the trace amounts of metals leached from stainless steel are not an issue. Cons: You can't microwave it and (it has to be said) when it does get dropped, it's really loud. Our Favorites [Ahimsa](https://ahimsahome.com)has sleek, stylish plates, and utensils made out of food grade stainless steel. Or check out this adorable divided plate in the shape of a [bus](http://innobaby.com/din-din-smart-stainless-divided-platter/)from Innobaby - sure to delight any toddler! To replace those ubiquitous plastic straw and sippy cups, try these super cute [tumblers](https://elkandfriends.com/collections/stainless-steel-mason-jars/products/stainless-steel-10oz-drinking-tumblers-food-storage-plum-lilac-peach-lemon)from Elk and Friends with silicone sleeves. Perfect for your cup-tossing munchkin! 4. Food-grade Silicone Pros: Comprised of a non-toxic polymer called \"silica,\" which is largely comprised of sand, [silicone](https://www.lifewithoutplastic.com/store/is_silicone_a_plastic#.WfTWKEyZOHo)is part of the rubber family and can withstand even the most energetic toddler handling. Even better, heating silicone materials won't cause them to off-gas or leach harmful chemicals, so they can be microwaved and washed in the dishwasher. It's easy to clean, sanitize and disinfect kids serveware with our toxin-free (and certified carbon neutral!) cleaner [Force of Nature](https://www.forceofnatureclean.com/). It works like a charm to remove oily residue from soaps and food. Cons: You have to make sure your product is made of 100% food grade silicone. Some products use plastic fillers, so do your research. In a pinch, give it a pinch! If you twist or pinch the silicone, it should not turn white - if it does, it has plastic fillers. While silicone is certainly preferable to plastic, it is still being studied and there is [some concern about leaching especially when used in high heat and with highly fatty foods like oils](https://www.nestedblissfully.com/silicone-safe/). For now, we recommend it as a back up to stainless steel & wood, especially when used for serving rather than baking. Our Favorites [Bumkins](https://www.bumkins.com/products/silicone-grip-dish?variant=42330384775)Silicone Grip Dish boasts dividers and a super-strong suction base to help it stay put. [Ooga](http://www.oogaa.com)offers a wide selection of silicone plates, bowls and utensils, some of which can go everywhere from the oven to the freezer, and they set the bar for safety higher than what is required here in the US. [Ezpz Mat](http://www.ezpzfun.com)is a classic and now have an adorable [play mat for art](http://www.ezpzfun.com/flower-play-mat-in-lemon/)in their collection as well.
