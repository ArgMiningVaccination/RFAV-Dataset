Science involves observations, formulation of hypotheses, and testing of hypotheses. This book is directed to quanti\u00afable observations about living systems and hypotheses about the processes of life that are for- mulated as mathematical models. Using three biologically important examples, growth of the bacterium Vibrio natrigens , depletion of light below the surface of a lake or ocean, and growth of a mold colony, we demonstrate how to formulate mathematical models that lead to dynamic equations descriptive of natural processes. You will see how to compute solution equations to the dynamic equations and to test them against experimental data. Examine the picture of the mold colony (Day 6 of Figure 1.14) and answer the question, \\Where is the growth?\" You will \u00afnd the answer to be a fundamen- tal component of the process. In our language, a mathematical model is a concise verbal description of the interactions and forces that cause change with time or position of a biological system (or physical or economic or other system). The modeling process begins with a clear verbal statement based on the scientist's understanding of the interactions and forces that govern change in the system. In order for mathematical techniques to assist in understanding the system, the verbal statement must be translated into an equation, called the dynamic equation of the model. Knowledge of the initial state of a system and the dynamic equation that describes the forces of change in the system is often su\u00b1cient to forecast an 1Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 2 observed pattern of the system. A solution equation may be derived from the dynamic equation and an initial state of the system and a graph or table of values of the solution equation may then be compared with the observed pattern of nature. The extent to which solution equation matches the pattern is a measure of the validity of the mathematical model. Mathematical modeling is used to describe the underlying mechanisms of a large number of processes in the natural or physical or social sciences. The chart in Figure 1.1 outlines the steps followed in \u00afnding a mathematical model. Initially a scientist examines the biology of a problem, formulates a concise description, writes equations capturing the essence of the description, solves the equations, and makes predictions about the biological process. This path is marked by the bold arrows in Figure 1.1. It is seldom so simple! Almost always experimental data stimulates exchanges back and forth between a biologist and a computational scientist (mathematician, statistician, computer scientist) before a model is obtained that explains some of the biology. This additional exchange is represented by lightly marked arrows in Figure 1.1.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 3 Biological World BacteriaMathematical World Equations Computer Programs Biological Dynamics Bacteria GrowPP\u00b3\u00b3 ! \u00c3Mathematical Model Growth rate depends on bacterial density, available nutrients. % . ?# \" Biologist Observations ExperimentsDynamic equations Bt+1\u00a1Bt=R\u00a3Bt # \" % . ?# \" Analysis Bacteria Density vsTime\u00b3\u00b3PP ! \u00c3Solution Equations Bt= (1 + R)tB0 Figure 1.1: Biology - Mathematics: Information \u00b0ow chart for bacteria growth. An initial approach to modeling may follow the bold arrows in Figure 1.1. For V. natrigens growth the steps might be: \u00b2The scientist `knows' that 25% of the bacteria divide every 20 minutes. \u00b2If so, then bacteria increase, Bt+1\u00a1Bt, should be 0 :25Btwhere tmarks time in 20 minute intervals andBtis the amount of bacteria at the end of the tth20 minute interval. \u00b2From Bt+1\u00a1Bt= 0:25Bt, the scientist may conclude that Bt= 1:25tB0 (More about this conclusion later).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 4 \u00b2The scientist uses this last equation to predict what bacteria density will be during an experiment in which V. natrigens , initially at 106cells per milliliter, are grown in a \u00b0ask for two hours. \u00b2In the \u00afnal stage, an experiment is carried out to grow the bacteria, their density is measured at selected times, and a comparison is made between observed densities and those predicted by equations. Reality usually strikes at this stage, for the observed densities may not match the predicted densities. If so, the additional network of lightly marked arrows of the chart is implemented. Adjustments to a model of V. natrigen growth that may be needed include: 1.Di\u00aeerent growth rate: A simple adjustment may be that only, say 20%, of the bacteria are dividing every 20 minutes and Bt= 1:2tB0matches experimental observations. 2.Variable growth rate: A more complex adjustment may be that initially 25% of the bacteria were dividing every 20 minutes but as the bacteria became more dense the growth rate fell to, say only 10% dividing during the last 20 minutes of the experiment. 3.Age dependent growth rate: A di\u00aeerent adjustment may be required if initially all of the bacteria were from newly divided cells so that, for example, most of them grow without division during the \u00afrst two 20 minute periods, and then divide during the third 20 minute interval. 4.Synchronous growth: A relatively easy adjustment may account for the fact that bacterial cell division is sometimes regulated by the photo period, causing all the bacteria to divide at a certain time of day. The green alga Chlamydomonas moewussi , for example, when grown in a laboratory with alternate 12 hour intervals of light and dark, accumulate nuclear subdivisions and each cell divides into eight cells at dawn of each day1. 1.1 Experimental data, bacterial growth. Population growth was historically one of the \u00afrst concepts to be explored in mathematical biology and it continues to be of central importance. Thomas Malthus in 1821 asserted a theory \\that human population tends to increase at a faster rate than its means of subsistence and that unless it is checked by moral restraint or disaster (as disease, famine, or war) widespread poverty and degradation inevitably result.\"2 In doing so he was following the bold arrows in Figure 1.1. World population has increased approximately six fold since Malthus' dire warning, and adjustments using the additional network of the chart are still being argued. Bacterial growth data from a V. natrigens experiment are shown in Table 1.1. The population was grown in a commonly used nutrient growth medium, but the pH of the medium was adjusted to be pH 6.253. 1Emil Bernstein, Science 131(1960), 1528. 2Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition. 3The experiment was a semester project of Deb Christensen in which several V. natrigens populations were grown in a range of pH values.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 5 Table 1.1: Measurements of bacterial den- sity. The units of \\Population Density\" are those of absorbance as measured by the spec- trophotometer. pH 6.25 Time Time Population Pop Change/ (min) Index Density Unit Time t Bt(Bt+1\u00a1Bt)=1 0 0 0.022 0.014 16 1 4 0.169 0.097 80 5 0.266 How do you measure bacteria density? Ideally you would place, say 1 microliter, of growth medium under a microscope slide and count the bacteria in it. This is di\u00b1cult, so the procedure commonly used is to pass a beam of light through a sample of growth medium and measure the amount of light absorbed. The greater the bacterial density the more light that is absorbed and thus bacterial density is measured in terms of absorbance units. The instrument used to do this is called a spectrophotometer . The spectrophotometer gives you a measure of light absorbance which is directly proportional to the bacterial density (that is, light absorbance is a constant times bacterial density). Absorbance is actually de\u00afned by Absorbance = \u00a1log10It I0 where I0is the light intensity passing through the medium with no bacteria present and Itis the light intensity passing through the medium with bacteria at time t. It may seem more natural to use I0\u00a1It I0 as a measure of absorbance. The reason for using log10It I0is related to our next example for light absorbance below the surface of a lake, but is only easy to explain after continuous models are studied in Chapter 5 (Exercise 5.5.17). 1.1.1 Steps towards building a mathematical model. This section illustrates one possible sequence of steps leading to a mathematical model of bacterial growth. Step 1. Preliminary Mathematical Model: Description of bacterial growth. Bacterial populations increase rapidly when grown at low bacterial densities in abundant nutrient. The populationCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 6 A 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 600.050.10.150.20.25 Time Index, tPopulation Density, Bt B 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 600.020.040.060.080.10.12 Time Index, tPop.

(C) Population density change per unit time, Bt+1\u00a1Bt,vspopulation density, Bt. increase is due to mitotic cell division { single cells divide asexually into two cells, subsequently the two cells divide to form four cells, and so on. Step 2. Notation. The \u00afrst step towards building equations for a mathematical model is an introduction of notation. In this case the data involve time and bacterial density, and it is easy to let t denote time and Btdenote bacterial density at time t. However, the data was read in multiples of 16 minutes, and it will help our notation to rescale time so that tis 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Thus B3is the bacterial density at time 3 \u00a316 = 48 minutes. The rescaled time is shown under `Time Index' in Table 1.1. Step 3. Derive a dynamic equation. In some cases your mathematical model will be su\u00b1ciently explicit that you are able to write the dynamic equation directly from the model. For this development, we \u00afrst look at supplemental computations and graphs of the data. Step 3a. Computation of rates of change from the data. Table 1.1 contains a computed column, `Population Change per Unit Time'. Change per unit time is often an important quantity in models. Using our notation, B0= 0:022; B 1= 0:024; etc. Step 3b. Graphs of the Data. Another important step in modeling is to obtain a visual image of the data. Shown in Figure 1.2 are three graphs that illustrate bacterial growth. Bacterial Growth A is a plot of column 3 vscolumn 2, B is a plot of column 4 vscolumn 2, and C is a plot of column 4 vscolumn 3 from the Table 1.1. Note: In plotting data, the expression `plot BvsA' means that Bis the vertical coordinate and Ais the horizontal coordinate. Students sometimes reverse the axes, and disrupt a commonly used convention that began some 350 years ago. In plotting bacterial density vstime, students may put bacterial density on the horizontal axis and time on the vertical axis, contrary to widely used practice. Perhaps if the mathematician who introduced analytic geometry, Rene DesCartes of France and Belgium, had lived in China where documents are read from top to bottom by columns and from right to left, plotting of data would follow another convention. We suggest that you use the established convention.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 7 The graph Bacterial Growth A is a classic picture of low density growth with the graph curving upward indicating an increasing growth rate. Observe from Bacterial Growth B that the rateof growth (column 4, vertical scale) is increasing with time. The graph Bacterial Growth C is an important graph for us, for it relates the bacterial increase to bacterial density, and bacterial increase is based on the cell division described in our mathematical model. Because the points lie approximately on a straight line it is easy to get an equation descriptive of this relation. Step 3c. An Equation Descriptive of the Data. Shown in Figure 1.3 is a reproduction of the graph Bacterial Growth C in which the point (0.15,0.1) is marked with an `+' and a line is drawn through (0,0) and (0.15,0.1). The slope of the line is 2/3. The line is `\u00aft by eye' to the \u00afrst four points. The line can be `\u00aft' more quantitatively, but it is not necessary to do so at this stage. 00.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 Time, A line \u00aft to the \u00afrst four data points of bacterial growth. The line contains (0,0) and (0.15, 0.1) and has slope = 2/3. The \u00affth point, which is ( B4; B5\u00a1B4) = (0 :169;0:097) lies below the line. Because the line is so close to the \u00afrst four points, there is a suggestion that during the fourth time period, the growth, B5\u00a1B4= 0:97, is below expectation, or perhaps, B5= 0:266 is a measurement error and should be larger. These bacteria were actually grown and measured for 160 minutes and we will \u00afnd in Section 11.6.1 that the measured value B5= 0:266 is consistent with the remaining data. The bacterial growth is slowing down after t= 4, or after 64 minutes. The slope of the line in Bacterial Growth C is0:1 0:15=2 3and the y-intercept is 0. Therefore an equation of the line is y=2 3x Step 3d. Convert data equation to a dynamic equation. The points in Bacterial Growth C were plotted by letting x=Btandy=Bt+1\u00a1Btfort= 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. If we substitute for xandyinto the data equation y=2 3xwe get Bt+1\u00a1Bt=2 3Bt (1.1) Equation 1.1 is our \u00afrst instance of a dynamic equation descriptive of a biological process.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 8 Step 4. Enhance the preliminary mathematical model of Step 1. The preliminary mathematical model in Step 1 describes microscopic cell division and can be expanded to describe the macroscopic cell density that was observed in the experiment. One might extrapolate from the original statement, but the observed data guides the development. In words Equation 1.1 says that the growth during the t-th time interval is2 3times Bt, the bacteria present at time t, the beginning of the period. The number2 3is called the relative growth rate - the growth per time interval is two-thirds of the current population size. More generally, one may say: Mathematical Model 1.1.1 Bacterial Growth. A \u00afxed fraction of cells divide every time period. (In this instance, two-thirds of the cells divide every 16 minutes.) Step 5. Compute a solution to the dynamic equation. We \u00afrst compute estimates of B1and B2predicted by the dynamic equation. The dynamic equation 1.1 speci\u00afes the change in bacterial density ( Bt+1\u00a1Bt) from tto time t+ 1. In order to be useful, an initial value of B0is required. We assume the original data point, B0= 0:022 as our reference point. It will be convenient to change Bt+1\u00a1Bt=2 3Btinto what we call an iteration equation: Bt+1\u00a1Bt=2 3Bt Bt+1=5 3Bt (1.2) Iteration Equation equations compute B1,B2,B3,B4, and B5. There is also some important notation used to describe the values of Btdetermined by the iteration Bt+1=5 for B4in terms of B0, using the pattern of the last equations.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 9 At time interval 5, we get B5=5 3\u00a35 3\u00a35 3\u00a35 3\u00a35 3\u00a3B0 \u00a3B0: The general form is Bt=\u00b55 3\u00b6t (1.3) Using the starting 0:022, Equation 1.3 becomes Bt= 0:022\u00b55 3\u00b6t (1.4) and is the solution to the initial condition and dynamic equation 1.1 B0= 0:022; B t+1\u00a1Bt=2 3Bt Populations whose growth is described by an equation of the form Pt=P0Rtwith R >1 are said to exhibit exponential growth . Equation 1.4 is written in terms of the time index, t. In terms of time, Tin minutes, T= 16tand Equation 1.4 may be written BT= 0:022\u00b55 3\u00b6T=16 = 0:022\u00a31:032T(1.5) Step 6. Compare predictions from the Mathematical Model with the original data. How well did we do? That is, how well do the computed values of bacterial density, Bt, match the observed values? The original and computed values are shown in Figure 1.4. The computed values match the observed values closely except for the last measurement where the observed value is less than the value predicted from the mathematical model. The e\u00aeect of cell crowding or environmental contamination or age of cells is beginning to appear after an hour of the experiment and the model does not take this into account. We will return to this population with data for the next 80 minutes of growth in Section 11.6.1 and will develop a new model that will account for decreasing rate of growth as the population size increases. 1.1.2 Concerning the validity of a model. We have used the population model once and found that it matches the data rather well. The validity of a model, however, is only established after multiple uses in many laboratories and critical examination of the forces and interactions that lead to the model equations. Models evolve as knowledge accumulates. Mankind's model of the universe has evolved from the belief that Earth is the center of the universe, toCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 10 pH 6.25 Time Time Population Computed (min) Index Density Density 0 0 0.022 0.022 16 1 0.036 0.037 32 0.169 0.170 80 5 0.266 0.283 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 600.050.10.150.20.25 Time Index, tPopulation Density, Bt Figure 1.4: Tabular and graphical comparison of actual bacterial densities (o) with bacterial densities computed computed from Equation 1.3 (+). the Copernican model that the sun is the center of the universe, to the realization that the sun is but a single star among some 200 billion in a galaxy, to the surprisingly recent realization (Hubble, 1923) that our Milky Way galaxy is but a single galaxy among an enormous universe of galaxies. It is fortunate that our solution equation matched the data, but it must be acknowledged that two crucial parameters, P0andr, were computed from the data, so that a \u00aft may not be a great surprise. Other equations also match the data. The parabola, y= 0:0236 t+ to the \u00afrst \u00afve data points is shown in Figure 1.5, and it matches the data as well as does Pt= 0:022(5 =3)t. We prefer Pt= 0:022(5 =3)tas an explanation of the data over the parabola obtained by the method of least squares because it is derived from an understanding of bacterial growth as described by the model whereas the parabolic equation is simply a match of equation to data. 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 600.050.10.150.20.25 Time Index, tPopulation Density, Bt Figure 1.5: y= which \u00aft by least squares to the \u00afrst six data points (o) of V.

Light extinction with increasing depth of water determines underwater plant, algae, and phytoplankton growth and thus has important biological consequences. We develop and analyze a mathematical model of light extinction below the surface of the ocean. Figure 1.6: There is less light in the water below the shark than there is in the water above the shark. Sunlight is the energy source of almost all life on Earth and its penetration into oceans and lakes largely determines the depths at which plant, algae and phytoplankton life can persist.

The steps in the analysis of light depletion are analogous to the steps for the analysis of bacterial growth in Section 1.1. Step 1. Statement of a mathematical model. Think of the ocean as divided into layers, say one meter thick, as illustrated in Figure 1.8. As light travels downward from the surface, each layer will absorb some light. We will assume that the distribution of suspended particles in the water is uniform so that the light absorbing properties of each two layers are the same. We hypothesize that each two layers will absorb the same fraction of the light that enters it. The magnitude of the light absorbed will be greater in the top layers than in the lower layers simply because the intensity of the light entering the the top layers is greater than the intensity of light at the lower layers. We state the hypothesis as a mathematical model.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 18 Mathematical Model 1.3.1 Light depletion with depth of water. Each layer absorbs a fraction of the light entering the layer from above. The fraction of light absorbed ,f, is the same for all layers of a \u00afxed thickness. I0 Id Id+10 1 2 d d+1Surface Figure 1.8: A model of the ocean par- titioned into layers. Step 2. Notation We will let ddenote depth (an index measured in layers) and Iddenote light intensity at depth d. Sunlight is partly re\u00b0ected by the surface, and I0(light intensity at depth 0) is to be the intensity of the light that penetrates the surface. I1is the light intensity at the bottom of the \u00afrst layer, and at the top of the second layer. The opacity of the water (Webster: opacity { `the relative capacity of matter to obstruct the transmission of [light]') is due generally to suspended particles and is a measure of the turbidity of the water. In relatively clear ocean water, atomic interaction with light is largely responsible for light decay. In the bacterial experiments, the growth of the bacteria increases the turbidity of the growth serum, thus increasing the absorbance. The fraction, f, of light absorbed by each layer is between 0 and 1 and although fis assumed to be the same for all layers, the value of fdepends on the thickness of the layers and the distribution of suspended particles in the water and atomic interactions with light. Approximately, f= Layer thickness \u00a3Opacity of the water. Layer thickness should be su\u00b1ciently thin that the preceding approximation yields a value of f <1. Thus for high opacity of a muddy lake, layer thickness of 20 cm might be required, but for a sparkling ocean, layer thickness of 10 m might be acceptable. Explore 1.3.2 Assume that at the surface light intensity I0is 400 watts/meter-squared and that each layer of thickness 2 meters absorbs 10% of the light that enters it. Calculate the light intensity at depths 2, 4, 6, \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2, 20 meters. Plot your data and compare your graph with the graph you drew in Explore 1.3.1.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 19 Step 3. Develop a dynamic equation representative of the model. Consider the layer between depths dandd+ 1 in Figure 1.8. The intensity of the light entering the layer is Id. The light absorbed by the layer between depths dandd+ 1 is the di\u00aeer- ence between the light entering the layer at depth dand the light leaving the layer at depth d+ 1, which is Id\u00a1Id+1. The mathematical model asserts that Id\u00a1Id+1=f\u00a3Id (1.10) Note that Iddecreases as dincreases so that both sides of equation 1.10 are positive. It is more common to write Id+1\u00a1Id=\u00a1f\u00a3Id (1.11) and to put this equation in iteration form Id+1= (1\u00a1f)Id Id+1=F Id (1.12) where F= 1\u00a1f. Because 0 < f < 1, also 0 < F < 1. Step 4. Enhance the mathematical model of Step 1. We are satis\u00afed with the model of Step 1 (have not yet looked at any real data!), and do not need to make an adjustment. Step 5. Solve the dynamical equation, Id+1\u00a1Id=\u00a1f\u00a3Id.The iteration form of the dynamical equation is Id+1=F Idand is similar to the iteration equation Bt+1=5 3Btof bacterial growth for which the solution is Bt=B0\u00b3 5 3\u00b4t. We conclude that the solution of the light equation is Id=I0\u00a3Fd(1.13) The solutions, Bt=B0\u00b55 3\u00b6t and Id=I0\u00a3FdF <1 3\u00b4tincreases with increasing tand for F <1, Fddecreases with increasing d. Step 6. Compare predictions from the model with experimental data. It is time we looked at some data. We present some data, estimate fof the model from the data, and compare values computed from Equation 1.13 with observed data. In measuring light extinction, it is easier to bring the water into a laboratory than to make measurements in a lake, and our students have done that. Students collected water from a campus lake with substantial suspended particulate matter (that is, yucky). A vertically oriented 3 foot section of 1.5 inch diameter PVC pipe was blocked at the bottom end with a clear plastic plate and a \u00b0ashlight was shined into the top of the tube (see Figure 1.9). A light detector was placed below the clear plastic at the bottom of the tube. Repeatedly, 30 cm3of lake water was inserted into the tube and the light intensity at the bottom of the tube was measured. One such data set is given in Figure 1.95. 5This laboratory is described in Brian A. Keller, Shedding light on the subject, Mathematics Teacher 91(1998), 756-771.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 20 Depth Idd Id+1\u00a1Id Layer mW/cm2mW/cm2 0 0.400 - 0.070 - 0.017 9 0.065 Figure 1.9: Diagram of laboratory equipment and data obtained from a light decay experiment. Explore 1.3.3 In Figure 1.10A is a graph of Idvsd. Compare this graph with the two that you drew in Explore 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. Our dynamical equation relates Id+1\u00a1IdtoIdand we compute change in intensity, Id+1\u00a1Id, just as we computed changes in bacterial population. The change in intensity, Id+1\u00a1Id, is the amount of light absorbed by layer, d. Graphs of the data. A graph of the original data, Idvsd, is shown in Figure 1.10(A) and and a graph of Id+1\u00a1IdvsIdis shown in Figure 1.10(B).

In Figure 1.10(B) we have drawn a line close to the data that passes through (0,0). Our reason that the line should contain (0,0) is that if Id, the amount of light entering layer dis small, then Id+1\u00a1Id, the amount of light absorbed by that layer is also small. Therefore, for additional layers, the data will cluster near (0,0). The graph of Id+1\u00a1IdvsIdis a scattered in its upper portion, corresponding to low light intensities. There are two reasons for this.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 21 1.Maintaining a constant light source during the experiment is di\u00b1cult so that there is some error in the data. 2.Subtraction of numbers that are almost equal emphasizes the error , and in some cases the error can be as large as the di\u00aeerence you wish to measure. In the lower depths, the light values are all small and therefore nearly equal so that the error in the di\u00aeerences is a large percentage of the computed di\u00aeerences. Use the data to develop a dynamic equation. The line goes through (0,0) and the point (0.4, -0.072). An equation of the line is y=\u00a10:18x Remember that yisId+1\u00a1IdandxisIdand substitute to get Id+1\u00a1Id=\u00a10:18Id (1.14) This is the dynamic Equation 1.11 with \u00a1f=\u00a10:18. Solve the dynamic equation. (Step 5 for this data.) The iteration form of the dynamic equation is Id+1=Id\u00a10:18Id Id+1= 0:82Id and the solution is (with I0= 0:400) Id= 0:82dI0= 0:400\u00a30:82d(1.15) Compare predictions from the Mathematical Model with the original data. How well did we do? Again we use the equations of the model to compute values and compare them with the original data. Shown in Figure 1.11 are the original data and data computed with ^Id= 0:400\u00a30:82d, and a graph comparing them. Depth Observed 0 layers dLight Intensity Id Figure 1.11: Comparison of original light intensities (o) with those computed from ^Id= 0:82d0:400 (+). The computed data match the observed data quite well, despite the `fuzziness' of the graph in Figure 1.10(b) of Id+1\u00a1IdvsIdfrom which the dynamic equation was obtained.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 22 Exercises for Section 1.3, Experimental data: Sunlight depletion below the surface of a lake or ocean. Exercise 1.3.1 In Table 1.5 are given four sets of data that mimic light decay with depth. For each data set, \u00afnd a number rso that the values B1,B2,B3,B4,B5andB6computed from the di\u00aeerence equation B0= as given in the table ; B t+1\u00a1Bt=\u00a1r\u00a3Bt are close to the corresponding numbers in the table. Compute the numbers, B1toB6using your value of Rin the equation and compare your computed numbers with the original data. For each data set, follow steps 3, 5, and 6.

Shown in the Exercise Table 1.3.2 are data from a light experiment using the laboratory procedure of this section. The only di\u00aeerence is the water that was used. Plot the data, compute di\u00aeerences and obtain a dynamic equation from the plot of di\u00aeerences vsintensities. Solve the dynamic equation and compute estimated values from the intensities and compare them with the observed light intensities. Finally, decide whether the water from your experiment is more clear or less clear than the water in Figure 1.9. (Note: Layer thickness was the same in both experiments.)

Why might you prefer Id= 0:400\u00a30:82dover the equation of the parabola as an explanation of the data?Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 23 Exercise 1.3.4 A light meter suitable for underwater photography was used to measure light intensity in the ocean at Roatan, Honduras. The meter was pointed horizontally. Film speed was set at 400 ASA and time at 1/60 s. The recommended shutter apertures ( fstop) at indicated depths are shown in Table Ex. 1.3.4. We show below that the light intensity is proportional to the square of the recommended shutter aperture. Do the data show exponential decay of light? Notes. The quanta of light required to expose the 400 ASA \u00aflm is a constant, C. The amount of light that strikes the \u00aflm in one exposure is A\u00a3\u00a2T\u00a3I, where Ais area of shutter opening, \u00a2 Tis the time of exposure (set to be 1/60 s) and Iis light intensity (quanta/(cm2-sec)).

Populations whose growth can be described by an exponential function (such as Pop= 0:022\u00a31:032T) have a characteristic doubling time , the time required for the population to double. The graph of the V. natrigens data and the graph of P= 0:022\u00a31:032T(Equation 1.5) that we derived from that data is shown in Figure 1.12. Observe that at T= 26, P= 0:05 and at T= 48, P= 0:1; thus Pdoubled from 0.05 to 0.1 in the 22 minutes between T= 26 and T= 48. Also, at T= 70, P= 0:2 so the population also doubled from 0.1 to 0.2 between T= 48 and T= 70, which is also 22 minutes. The doubling time, TDouble , can be computed as follows for exponential growth of the form P=A\u00a3BtB > 1Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 24 0 20 40 60 8000.050.10.150.20.25 Time Min Population Density 26 48 70 Figure 1.12: Data for V. natrigens growth and the graph of P= 0:022\u00a31:032T\u00aft to the data.

The doubling time, TDouble , is =T2\u00a1T1=log 2 logBDoubling Time (1.16) Thus the doubling time for the equation P=A BTis log 2 =logB.The doubling time depends only onBand not on Anor on the base of the logarithm. For the equation, Pop= 0:022\u00a31:032T, the doubling time is log 2 =log 1:032 = 22 :0056, as shown in the graph. Half Life. For the exponential equation y=A\u00a3BTwith B < 1,ydoes not grow. Instead, y decreases. The half-life, THalf, ofyis the time it takes for yto decrease by one-half. The word, `half-life' is also used in the context y=A\u00a3Bxwhere xdenotes distance instead of time. Data for light extinction below the surface of a lake from Section 1.3 on page 15 is shown in Figure 1.13 together with the graph of Id= 0:4\u00a30:82d Horizontal segments at Light = 0:4,Light = 0:2, and Light = 0:1 cross the curve in Figure 1.13 at d= 0,d= 3:5 and d= 7. The `half-life' of the light is 3.5 layers of water.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 25 101234567891000.10.20.30.4 Depth layersLight Intensity 0 3.5 7 Figure 1.13: Graph of light depletion with depth and the curve Id= 0:4\u00a30:82d\u00aft to the data. It might make more sense to you to call the number 3.5 the `half-depth' of the light, but you will be understood by a wider audience if you call it `half-life'.

Quadratic solution equations (equations of the form y= at2+bt+c) occur less frequently than do exponential solution equations in models of biological systems. Shown in Figure 1.14 are some pictures taken of a mold colony growing on the surface of a mixture of tea and sugar. The pictures were taken at 10:00 each morning for 10 consecutive days. Assume that the area occupied by the mold is a reasonable measure of the size of the mold population. The grid lines are at 2mm intervals. Explore 1.5.1 From the pictures, measure the areas of the mold for the days 2 and 6 and enter them into the table of Figure 1.15. The grid lines are at 2mm intervals, so that each square is 4mm2. Check your additional data with points on the graph. Explore 1.5.2 Do this. It is interesting and important to the remaining analysis. Find numbers AandBso that the graph of y=A\u00a3Btapproximates the mold growth data in Figure 1.14. Either chose two data points and insist that the points satisfy the equation or use a calculator or computer to compute the least squares approximation to the data. Similarly \u00afnd a parabola y=at2+bt+cthat approximates the mold data. Draw graphs of the mold data, the exponential function, and the parabola that you found on a single set of axes. Many people would expect the mold growth to be similar to bacterial growth and to have an exponential solution equation. We wish to explore the dynamics of mold growth. Step 1. Mathematical model. Look carefully at the pictures in Figure 1.14. Observe that the features of the interior dark areas, once established, do not change. The growth is restricted to the perimeter of the colony6. On this basis we propose the model Mathematical Model 1.5.1 Mold growth. Each day the increase in area of the colony is proportional to the length of the perimeter of the colony at the beginning of the day (when the photograph was taken). Step 2. Notation. We will let tdenote day of the experiment, Atthe area of the colony and Ctthe length of the colony perimeter at the beginning of day t. 6The pictures show the mold colony from above and we are implicitly taking the area of the colony as a measure of the colony size. There could be some cell division on the underside of the colony that would not be accounted for by the area. Such was not apparent from visual inspection during growth as a clear gelatinous layer developed on the underside of the colony.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 28 Day 0 Day 5 Day 1 Day 6 Day 2 Day 7 Day 3 Day 8 Day 4 Day 9 Figure 1.14: Pictures of a mold colony, taken on ten successive days.

Dynamic equation. The statement that `a variable A is proportional to a variable B' means that there is a constant, k, and A=k\u00a3B Thus, `the increase in area of the colony is proportional to the perimeter' means that there is a constant, k, such that increase in area = k\u00a3perimeter The increase in the area of the colony on day tisAt+1\u00a1At, the area at the beginning of day t+ 1 minus the area at the beginning of day t. We therefore write At+1\u00a1At=k\u00a3Ct We now make the assumption that the mold colony is circular, so that7 Ct= 2p\u00bcq At Therefore At+1\u00a1At=k\u00a32p\u00bcq At (1.18) Step 5. Solve the dynamic equation. The dynamic equation 1.18 is di\u00b1cult to solve, and may not have a useful formula for its solution8. The formula, At= 0, de\u00afnes a solution that is not useful. (Exercise 1.5.2). A similar dynamic equation At+1\u00a1At\u00a11=Kq At (1.19) has a solution At=K2 16t2(1.20) 7For a you the details, but it can be shown that there is neither a quadratic nor exponential solution to Equation 1.18Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 30 and we ask you to con\u00afrm this solution in Exercise 1.5.5. The solution At=K2 16t2hasA0= 0, which is not entirely satisfactory. (There was no mold on day 0.) You are asked in Exercise 1.5.4 to estimate k\u00a32p\u00bcof Equation 1.18 and to iteratively compute approximations to A0,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2A9. The di\u00b1culties at this stage lead us to reconsider the original problem. Step 4. Reformulate the mathematical model. We have assumed the mold colony to be a circle expanding at its edges. We suggest that the radius is increasing at a constant rate, and write the following model. Step 1. Mold growth, reformulated. Each day the radius of the colony increases by a constant amount. Step 2. Notation, again. Let\u00bdtbe the radius9of the colony at the beginning of day t, and let \u00a2 (Greek letter delta) denote constant daily increase in radius. Step 3. Dynamic equation, again. The increase in radius on day tis\u00bdt+1\u00a1\u00bdt, the radius at the beginning of day t+ 1 minus the radius at the beginning of day t, and we write \u00bdt+1\u00a1\u00bdt= \u00a2 (1.21) An important procedure in developing equations is to write a single thing two di\u00aeerent ways, as we have just done for the increase in radius. Indeed, most equations do write a single thing two di\u00aeerent ways. Step 4. Solution equation, again. You will solve the equation \u00bdt+1\u00a1\u00bdt= \u00a2 in Exercise 1.8.2 and \u00afnd it intervening days between measurements \u00bd0and\u00bd9so the average daily increase in radius is \u00a2 1:16 1 :16t)2(1.23) 9We use the Greek letter \u00bd(rho) for the radius. We have already used Randrin another context.)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 31 Step 6. Compare predictions from the model with observed data. A graph of At=\u00bc(1:13 + 1 :16t)2and the original mold areas is shown in Figure 1.16 where we can see a reasonable \u00aft, but there is a particularly close match at the two end points. It may be observed that only those two data points enter into calculations of the parameters 1.13 and 1.16 of the solution, which explains why the curve is close to them. 1 012345678910050100150200250300350400 Time daysArea of Mold Colony mm2 Figure 1.16: Comparison of the solution equa- tion 1.23 with the actual mold growth data.

Exercise 1.5.5 Examine the following model of mold growth: Model of mold growth, III.

In this section you will build a model of depletion of penicillin from plasma in a patient who has received a bolus injection of penicillin into the plasma. When penicillin was \u00afrst discovered, its usefulness was limited by the e\u00b1ciency with which the kidney eliminates penicillin from the blood plasma passing through it. The modi\u00afcations that have been made to penicillin (leading to amphicillin, moxicillin, mezlocillin, etc.) have enhanced its ability to cross membranes and reach targeted infections and reduced the rate at which the kidney clears the plasma of penicillin. Even with these improvements in penicillin, the kidneys remove 20 percent of the penicillin in the plasma passing through them. Furthermore, all of the blood plasma of a human passes through the kidneys in about 5 minutes. We therefore formulateCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 34 Mathematical Model 1.6.1 Renal clearance of penicillin. In each \u00afve minute interval following penicillin injection, the kidneys remove a \u00afxed fraction of the penicillin that was in the plasma at the beginning of the \u00afve minute interval. We believe the fraction to be about 0.2 so that 5 minutes after injection of penicillin into a vein, only 80% of the penicillin remains. This seems surprising and should cause you to question our assertion about renal clearance of penicillin10. Time Penicillin min Concentration \u00b9g/ml 0 200 5 152 10 118 15 93 20 74 0 5 10 15 20050100150200 Time minMezlocillin concentration mg Figure 1.18: Data for serum penicillin concentrations at 5 minute intervals for the 20 minutes following a `bolus' injection of 2 g into the serum of \\\u00afve healthy young volunteers (read `medical students')\" taken from T. Bergans, Penicillins, in Antibiotics and Chemotherapy , Vol 25, H. Sch\u00bfonfeld, Ed., S. Karger, Basel, New York, 1978. We are interpreting serum in this case to be plasma. An amount of drug placed instantaneously (that is, over a short period of time) in a body compartment (plasma, stomach, muscle, etc.) is referred to as a bolus injection . An alternative procedure iscontinuous infusion as occurs with an intravenous application of a drug. Geologists refer to a meteor entering the atmosphere as a bolide. Data for penicillin concentration following a 2 g bolus injection are shown in Figure 1.18. Explore 1.6.1 We think you will be able to develop this model without reading our development, and will \u00afnd it much more interesting than reading a solution. You have a mathematical model and relevant data. You need to Step 2. Introduce appropriate notation. Step 3. Write a dynamic equation describing the change in penicillin concentration. You will need a crucial negative sign here, because penicillin is removed, and the change in penicillin concentration is negative. Evaluate a parameter of the dynamic equation. 10That all of the plasma passes through the kidney in 5 minutes is taken from Rodney A. Rhoades and George A. Tanner, Medical Physiology, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1995. \\In resting, healthy, young adult men, renal blood \u00b0ow averages about 1.2 L/min\", page 426, and \\The blood volume is normally 5-6 L in men and 4.5-5.5 L in women.\", page 210. \\Hematocrit values of the blood of health adults are 47 \u00a75% for men and 42 \u00a75% for women\", page 210 suggests that the amount of plasma in a male is about 6 L \u00a30.53 = 3.18 L. J. A. Webber and W. J. Wheeler, Antimicrobial and pharmacokinetic properties, in Chemistry and Biology of \u00af-Lactin Antibiotics, Vol. 1, Robert B. Morin and Marvin Gorman, Eds. Academic Press, New York, 1982, page 408 report plasma renal clearances of penicillin ranging from 79 to 273 ml/min. Plasma (blood minus blood cells) is approximately 53% of the blood so plasma \u00b0ow through the kidney is about 6 liters \u00a3 0.53/5 min = 0.636 l/min. Clearance of 20% of the plasma yields plasma penicillin clearance of 0.636 = 0.2 = 0.127 l/min = 127 ml/min which is between 79 and 273 ml/min.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 35 Step 4. Review the mathematical model (it will be excellent and this step can be skipped). Step 5. Write a solution equation to the dynamic equation. Step 6. Compare values computed with the solution equation with the observed data (you will \u00afnd a very good \u00aft). You will \u00afnd that from this data, 23 percent of the mezlocillin leaves the serum every \u00afve minutes. Exercises for Section 1.6, Constructing a Mathematical Model of Penicillin Clearance. Exercise 1.6.1 A one-liter \u00b0ask contains one liter of distilled water and 2 g of salt. Repeatedly, 50 ml of solution are removed from the \u00b0ask and discarded after which 50 ml of distilled water are added to the \u00b0ask. Introduce notation and write a dynamic equation that will describe the change of salt in the beaker each cycle of removal and replacement. How much salt is in the beaker after 20 cycles of removal? Exercise 1.6.2 A 500 milligram penicillin pill is swallowed and immediately enters the intestine. Every \u00afve minute period after ingestion of the pill 1.10% of the penicillin in the intestine at the beginning of the period is absorbed into the plasma. 2.15% of the penicillin in the plasma at the beginning of the period is removed by the kidney. LetItbe the amount of penicillin in the intestine and Stbe the amount of penicillin in the plasma at the end of the tth\u00afve minute period after ingestion of the pill.

Because of osmosis, the salt ions move from the small container to the fresh water reservoir that is so large that e\u00aeectively the reservoir concentration of salt will remain zero. Write a mathematical model of the transfer of salt from the small container to the large container. Introduce notation and write an initial condition and a di\u00aeerence equation with that will describe the course of salt concentration in the small container. Exercise 1.6.5 There is a standard osmosis experiment in biology laboratory as follows. Material: A thistle tube, a 1 liter \u00b0ask, some `salt water', and some pure water, a membrane that is impermeable to the salt and is permeable to the water. The bulb of the thistle tube is \u00aflled with salt water, the membrane is placed across the open part of the bulb, and the bulb is inverted in a \u00b0ask of pure water so that the top of the pure water is at the juncture of the bulb with the stem. Because of osmotic pressure the pure water will cross the membrane pushing water up the stem of the thistle tube until the increase in pressure inside the bulb due to the water in the stem matches the osmotic pressure across the membrane. Our problem is to describe the height of the water in the stem as a function of time. The following mathematical model would be appropriate.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 37 Mathematical Model. The amount of water crossing the membrane during any minute is proportional to the osmotic pressure across the membrane minus the pressure due to the water in the stem at the beginning of the minute. Assume that the volume of the bulb is much larger than the volume of the stem so that the concentration of `salt' in the thistle tube may be assumed to be constant, thus making the osmotic pressure a constant, P0(This is fortunate!). Assume that the radius of the thistle tube stem is rcm. Then an amount, Vcm3, of additional water inside the thistle tube will cause the water to rise V=(\u00bcr2) cm. Assume the density of the salt water to be \u00b1gm/cm. Introduce notation and write a di\u00aeerence equation with initial condition that will describe the height of the water in the stem as a function of time. 1.7 Movement toward equilibrium. Now we consider a new mathematical model that is used to describe the response of systems to constant infusion of material or energy. Examples include \u00b2A pristine lake has a constant \u00b0ow of fresh water into it and an equal \u00b0ow of water out of the lake. A factory is built next to the lake and each day releases a \u00afxed amount of chemical waste into the lake. The chemical waste will mix through out the lake and some will leave the lake in the water \u00b0owing out. The amount of chemical waste in the lake will increase until the amount of chemical leaving the lake each day is the same as the amount released by the factory each day. \u00b2The nitrogen in the muscle of a scuba diver is initially at 0.8 atm, the partial pressure of N 2in atmospheric air. She descends to 20 meters and breathes air with N 2partial pressure 2.4 atm. Almost immediately her blood N 2partial pressure is also 2.4 atm. Her muscle absorbs N 2more slowly; each minute the amount of N 2that \u00b0ows into her muscle is proportional to the di\u00aeerence between the partial pressures of N 2in her blood (2.4 atm) and in her muscle. Gradually her muscle N2partial pressure moves toward 2.4 atm. \u00b2A hen leaves a nest and exposes her eggs to air at temperatures that are lower than the 37\u00b1C of the eggs when she left. The temperature of the eggs will decrease toward the temperature of the air. Example 1.7.1 Chemical pollution in a lake. A pristine lake of area 2 km2and average depth of 10 meters has a river \u00b0owing through it at a rate of 10,000 m3per day. A factory is built beside the river and releases 100 kg of chemical waste into the lake each day. What will be the amounts of chemical waste in the lake on succeeding days? We propose the following mathematical model. Step 1. Mathematical Model. The daily change in chemical waste in the lake is di\u00aeerence between the amount released each day by the factory and the amount that \u00b0ows out of the lake down the exit river. The amount of chemical waste that leaves the lake each day is equal to the amount of water that leaves the lake that day times the concentration of chemical waste in that water. Assume that upon release from the factory, the chemical quickly mixes throughout the lake so that the chemical concentration in the lake is uniform. Step 2. Notation. Lettbe time measured in days after the factory opens and Wtbe the chemical waste in kg and Ctthe concentration of chemical waste in kg/m3in the lake on day t. Let Vbe the volume of the lake and Fthe \u00b0ow of water through the lake each day.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 38 Step 3. Equations. The lake volume its area times its depth; according to the given data, V= 2km2\u00a310m = 2 \u00a3107m3: F= 104m3 day The concentration chemical in the lake is Ct=Wt V=Wt 2\u00a3107kg m3 The change in the amount of chemical on day tisWt+1\u00a1Wtand Change per Day = Amount Added per Day \u00a1Amount Removed per Day 2\u00a3107 kg\u00a1kg = kg \u00a1 m3kg m3 and they are consistent. On day 0, the chemical content of the lake is 0. Thus we have W0= 0 Wt+1\u00a1Wt= 100 \u00a15\u00a310\u00a14Wt and we rewrite it as W0= 0 Wt+1= 100 + 0 :9995Wt Step 5. Solve the dynamic equation. We can compute the amounts of chemical waste in the lake on the \u00afrst few days11and \u00afnd 0, 100, 199.95, entries. We could iterate 365 times to \u00afnd out what the chemical level will be at the end of one year (but would likely loose count). Equilibrium State. The environmentalists want to know the `eventual state' of the chemical waste in the lake. They would predict that the chemical in the lake will increase until there is no perceptual change on successive days. The equilibrium state is a number Esuch that if Wt=E,Wt+1is also E. From Wt+1= 100 + 0 :9995 we write E= 100 + :9995E; E 200000 : 11On your calculator: 0 ENTER \u00a30.9995 + 100 ENTER ENTER ENTER ENTERCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 39 When the chemical in the lake reaches 200000 kg, the amount that \u00b0ows out of the lake each day will equal the amount introduced from the factory each day. The equilibrium Eis also useful mathematically. Subtract the equations Wt+1= 100 + :9995 0:9995( this equation is Dt+1 :9995Dt which has 200000 \u00a1200000 \u00a30:9995t in Figure 1.19, and Wtis asymptotic to 200000. 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 700000.20.40.60.811.21.41.61.82x 105 Time DaysChemical Waste kg 4 8 12 16 20Equilibrium = 200000 Years Wt = 200000 200000 (0.9995)t Figure 1.19: The amount of waste chemical in a lake.

Observe that even after 20 years the lake is not quite to equilibrium. We can \u00afnd out how long it takes for the lake to reach 98 percent of the equilibrium value by asking for what tisWt= 0:98\u00a3200000?. Thus, 0 :02 0:02 log 0:9995= 7822 days = 21 :4 yearsCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 40 Step 6. Compare the solution with data. Unfortunately we do not have data for this model. The volume and stream \u00b0ow were selected to approximate Lake Erie, but the lake is much more complex than our simple model. However, a simulation of the process is simple. Example 1.7.2 Simulation of chemical discharge into a lake. Begin with two one-liter beakers, a supply of distilled water and salt and a meter to measure conductivity in water. Place one liter of distilled water and 0.5 g of salt in beaker F (factory). Place one liter of distilled water in beaker L (lake). Repeatedly do a.Measure and record the conductivity of the water beaker L. b.Remove 100 ml of solution from beaker L and discard. c.Transfer 100 ml of salt water from beaker F to beaker L. The conductivity of the salt water in beaker F should be about 1000 microsiemens ( \u00b9S). The conductivity of the water in beaker L should be initially 0 and increase as the concentration of salt in L increases. Data and a graph of the data are shown in Figure 1.20 and appears similar to the graph in Figure 1.19. In Exercise 1.7.4 you are asked to write and solve a mathematical model of this simulation and and compare the solution with the data.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 41 Cycle Conductivity Number \u00b9S 0 0 1 112 2 207 3 289 4 358 5 426 6 482 7 526 8 581 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 90100200300400500600 Cycle number represents timeConductance microsiemens ( \u00b5S) Figure 1.20: Data for Example 1.7.2, simulation of infusion of chemical waste product in a lake.

Exercise 1.7.5 For our model of lake pollution, we assume \\that upon release from the factory, the chemical quickly mixes throughout the lake so that the chemical concentration in the lake is uniform.\" The time scale for 'quickly' is relative to the other parts of the model; in this case to the daily \u00b0ow into and out of the lake. Suppose it takes 10 days for 100 kg of chemical released from the factory to mix uniformly throughout the lake. Write a mathematical model for this case. There are several reasonable models; your task to write one of them.

She descends to 30 meters and immediately the N 2partial pressure in her blood is 2.4 atm, and remains at 2.4 atm while she remains at 30 meters. Each minute the N 2partial pressure in her muscle increases by an amount that is proportional to the di\u00aeerence in 2.4 and the partial pressure of nitrogen in her muscle at the beginning of that minute. a.Write a dynamic equation with initial condition to describe the N 2partial pressure in her muscle. b.Your dynamic equation should have a proportionality constant.

We convert Pt+1\u00a1Pt=r Pt+b to iteration form Pt+1=R P t+b; where R=r+ 1: (1.25) Next we look for an equilibrium value Esatisfying E=R\u00a3E+b: (1.26) (Think, if Pt=Ethen Pt+1=E.)

The light intensity is measured with a Texas Instruments Calculator Based Laboratory (CBL) which is calibrated in milliwatts/cm2= mW/cm2. If the data are transformed as shown in Figure 1.21B then they become very interesting. For each point, ( d; I) of Figure 1.21A, the point (1 =d2; I) is plotted in Figure 1.21B. Light intensity vs the reciprocal of the square of the distance from the light source is shown. It looks pretty linear. Explore 1.9.1 a.One data point is omitted from Figure 1.21B.

It appears that we have found an interesting relation between light intensity and distance from a light source. In the rest of this section we will examine the geometry of light emission and see a fundamental reason suggesting that this relation would be expected. In Section 1.3 we saw that sunlight decayed exponentially with depth in the ocean. In Example 1.9.1 we saw that light decreased proportional to the reciprocal of the square of the distance from the light source. These two cases are distinguished by the model of light decrease, and the crux of the problem is the de\u00afnition of light intensity, and how the geometry of the two cases a\u00aeects light transmission, and the medium through which the light travels. Light Intensity. Light intensity from a certain direction is de\u00afned to be the number of photons per second crossing a square meter region that is perpendicular to the chosen direction. The numerical value of light intensity as just de\u00afned is generally large { outside our range of experience { and may be divided by a similarly large number to yield a measurement more practical to use. For example, some scientists divide by Avagadro's number, 6 :023\u00a31023. A more standard way is to convert photons to energy and photons per second to watts and express light intensity in watts per meter squared. Light rays emanating from a point source expand radially from the source. Because of the distance between the sun and Earth, sun light strikes the Earth in essentially parallel rays and light intensity remains constant along the light path, except for the interference from substance along the path. When light is measured `close to' a point source, however, the light rays expand and light intensity decreases as the observer moves away from the source. Consider a cone with vertex Vat a point source of light. The number of photons per second traveling outward within the solid is cone constant. As can be seen in Figure 1.22, however, because the areas of surfaces stretching across the cone expand as the distance from the source increases, the density of photons striking the surfaces decreases. Mathematical Model 1.9.1 Light Expansion: For light emanating uniformly from a point source and traveling in a solid cone, the number of photons per second crossing the surface of a sphere with center at the vertex of the cone is a constant, N, that is, independent of the radius of the sphere. Because light intensity is `number of photons per second per square meter of surface' we have N=Id\u00a3Ad (1.31) where N is photons per second in a solid cone emanating from a light source at the vertex of the cone. d is distance from the light source. Idis light intensity at distance d. Adis the area of the intersection with the cone of the surface of a sphere of radius dand center at the vertex of the cone.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 47 33r 22r 1r Figure 1.22: Light expansion in a cone.

Thus it is not a surprise that in Example 1.9.1, the intensity of light emanating from the 12 volt, 0.5 amp bulb was proportional to the reciprocal of the square of the light intensity. For light emanating from a point source, the light intensity on the surface of a sphere with center at the point source and radius dis a constant, that is, the light intensity is the same at any two points of the sphere.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 48 Exercise 1.9.1 Shown in Table 1.9.1 is data showing how light intensity from a linear light source decreases as distance from the light increases. Card board was taped on the only window in a room so that a one centimeter wide vertical slit of length 118 cm was left open. For this experiment, we considered 118 cm slit to be an in\u00afnitely long line of light. Other lights in the room were cut o\u00ae. A light meter was pointed horizontally towards the center of the slit, 56 cm above the bottom of the slit, and light intensity was measured as the light meter was moved away from the window. a.This experiment is easy to replicate. Try and use your own data for the next two parts. Best to have either a clear day or an overcast day; constant sunlight is needed. b.Light emitted from a point surface is constant on surfaces of spheres with center at the light source. On which surfaces would you expect the intensity of light emitted from a linear source be constant? c.(You may wish to do the next part before this one.) Explore the data and see whether you can \u00afnd a relation between light intensity and some aspect of distance. d.Formulate a model of how light decays with distance from a slit light source and relate your model to your observed relation.

In Example 1.9.1 of light intensity from a 12 volt bulb we modeled data and only subsequently built a mathematical model of light decrease from a point source of light. There are other examples of modeling of data that are interesting but there is very little possibility of building a mathematical model to explain the process. Example 1.10.1 Jack A. Wolfe12observed that leaves of trees growing in cold climates tend to be incised (have ragged edges) and leaves of trees growing in warm climates tend to have smooth edges (lacking lobes or teeth). He measured the percentages of species that have smooth margins among all species of the \u00b0ora in many locations in eastern Asia. His data, as read from a graph in U. S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1106, is presented in Figure 1.10.0.2. 12Jack A.

The line was used by Wolfe to estimate temperatures over the last 65 million years based on observed fossil leaf composition (Exercise 1.10.1). The prospects of writing a mathematical model describing the relationship of smooth edge leaves to temperature are slim, however. Example 1.10.1 On several nights during August and September in Ames, Iowa, some students listened to crickets chirping. They counted the number of chirps in a minute (chirp rate, R) and also recorded the air (ambient) temperature ( T) in F\u00b1for the night. The data were collected between 9:30 and 10:00 pm each night, and are shown in the table and graph in Figure 1.24.

We \u00aft a line to the data, but there is no underlying explanation of what mechanism is causing the relation. Exercises for Section 1.10, Data modeling vsmathematical models. Exercise 1.10.1 Jack Wolfe applied his data (Figure 1.10.0.2) to resolve a dispute about estimates of ambient temperatures during the last 65 million years. Fossil leaves from strata ranging in age back to 65 million years were examined for the percent of smooth-leafed species in each stratum. Under the hypothesis that the relation between percent of smooth-leafed species and temperature in modern species persisted over the last 65 million years, he was able to estimate the past temperatures. Your job is to replicate his work. Although Wolfe collected fossil leaf data from four locations ranging from southern Alaska to Mississippi, we show only his data from the Paci\u00afc Northwest, in Table Ex. 1.10.1, read from a graph in Wolfe's article in American Scientist . Use the Percent Smooth data for the fossil leaves at previous times in Table Ex. 1.10.1, and the modern relation, temp = 0 :89 + 0 :313\u00a3% smooth, to draw a graph showing the history of ambient temperature for the land of the Paci\u00afc Northwest a.Over the period from 50 to 40 million years ago. b.Over the period from 35 to 26 million years ago. c.Over the period from 26 to 16 million years ago. d.Over the period from 16 to 6 million years ago.

Also use Equation 1.32 to compute the same temperature and compare your results. b.On the basis of Equation 1.32, what cricket chirp frequencies might be expected for the temperatures 110\u00b1F and 40\u00b1F? Discuss your answers in terms of the data in Figure 1.24 and the interval on which the equation is valid.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 51 c.A television report stated that in order to tell the temperature, count the number of cricket chirps in 13 seconds and add 40. The result will be the temperature in Fahrenheit degrees. Is that consistent with Equation 1.32? (Suggestion: Solve for Temperature\u00b1F in terms of Cricket Chirps per Minute.) Exercise 1.10.3 Some students made a small hole near the bottom of the cylindrical section of a two-liter plastic beverage container, held a \u00afnger over the hole and \u00aflled the container with water to the top of the cylindrical section, at 15.3 cm. The small hole was uncovered and the students marked the height of the water remaining in the tube, reported here at eighty-second intervals, until the water ran out. They then measured the heights of the marks above the hole. The data gathered and a graph of the data are shown in Figure 1.25.

The best models are su\u00b1ciently detailed in their description that dynamic equations describing the progress of the underlying system can be written and lead to solution equations that describe the overall behavior. In our models there was a quantity ( Q) that changed with either time or distance ( v) and the dynamic equation speci\u00afed how the change in Q,Qv+1\u00a1Qv, depended on Qorv. The solution equation explicitly expressed the relation of Qtov. In some cases, such as the case of cricket chirp frequency dependence on ambient temperature in Example 1.10.1, the underlying mechanism is too complex to model it. The observation, however, stimulates considerable thought about why it should be. Presumably the metabolism of the cricket increases with temperature thus causing an increase in chirp frequency, but the phrase, `metabolism of the cricket', masks a large complexity. We have generally followed certain steps in developing our models. They are useful steps but by no means do they capture the way to model the biological universe. The modeling process is varied and has to be adapted to the questions at hand.

Consider a vertical column of air based at sea level divided at intervals of 10 meters and assume that the temperature of the air within the column is constant, say 20\u00b1C. The pressure at any height is the weight of air in the column above that height divided by the cross sectional area of the column. In a 10-meter section of the column, by the ideal gas law the the mass of air within the section is proportional to the product of the volume of the section and the pressure within the section (which may be considered constant and equal to the pressure at the bottom of the section). The weight of the air above the lower height is the weight of air in the section plus the weight of air above the upper height. Sea-level atmospheric pressure is 1 atm and the pressure at 18,000 feet is one-half that at sea level (an easy to remember datum from NASA).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 55 Figure for Exercise 1.11.0 Figure for Exercise 1.7. 012hh+1 PhPh+1Chapter 2 Functions as Descriptions of Biological Patterns. Where are we going? Relations between quantities are so central to science and mathematics that the concept has been carefully de\u00afned and is named function . You will see how tables of data, graphs, and equations are uni\u00afed into a single concept, function. This chapter will present examples of some unusual relations between quantities that suggest the usefulness of the general concept, and it will introduce three de\u00afnitions offunction with increasing levels of precision. Electrocardiograms are ex- amples of relations between voltage and time that are functions. Equations to de- scribe the relation are di\u00b1- cult to \u00afnd, and once found, are not informative. It is better to think of each trace as simply a function. Many biological relations may be described by equations | linear, quadratic, hyperbolic, exponential, and logarithmic. These together with the trigonometric equations cover most of the commonly encountered equations. Scienti\u00afc calculators readily compute these values that in the past were laboriously computed by hand and recorded in lengthy tables. There are some relations between measured quantities that are not so easily described by equations, and in this chapter we see how we can extend the use of equations to describe relations to a general concept referred to as a function . Formal de\u00afnitions of function and ways of combining functions are presented. 56Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 57 2.1 Environmental Sex Determination in Turtles It is a well known, but little understood fact that the sex of some reptiles depends on the environment in which the egg is incubated (temperature is important), and is not purely a genetic determination. A graph of some data on a species of fresh water turtles appears in Figure 2.11. Explore 2.1.1 Examine the graph for Chrysemys picta and write a brief verbal description of the dependence of the % Female on incubation temperature for a clutch of Chrysemys picta eggs. 22 24 26 28 30 32020406080100 Incubation female hatchlings incubation of Chrysemys picta eggs at various temperatures. Your experience probably does not include a single analytic formula that describes the dependence of the % Female on incubation temperature for a clutch of turtle eggs. It is easiest to use a piecewise de\u00afnition; use one formula for a range of temperatures and other formulas for other ranges of temperatures. Your verbal description in the case of Chrysemys picta could say that if the temperature is less than 28\u00b1C, the percent of female is zero, and if the temperature is greater than or equal to 29\u00b1C, the percent of female is 100. One could describe what happens between 28\u00b1C and 29\u00b1C, but the accuracy of the data probably does not warrant such a re\u00afnement. This piecewise procedure of describing data occurs often enough to have a special notation. Percent female =8 >< >:0 if Temp <28\u00b1C Uncertain if 28\u00b1C\u00b7Temp if 29\u00b1C\u00b7Temp(2.1) The designation Uncertain for 28\u00b1C\u00b7Temp <29\u00b1C is a bit unsatisfactory but we hope the example su\u00b1ciently illustrates piecewise de\u00afnition of dependence. 1This data was collected by Ralph Ackerman from a number of publications, most of which are referenced in, Fredric J. Janzen and Gary L. Paukstis, Environmental sex determination in reptiles: Ecology, evolution, and experimental design, The Quarterly Review of Biology 66(1991) 149-179.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 58 Exercise 2.1.1 Data on the temperature determination of sex for the snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina appears in Figure Ex. 2.1.1. a.Write a verbal description of the dependence of the % Female on incubation temperature for a clutch of Chelydra serpentina eggs. b.Write formulas similar to Formulas 2.1 to describe the dependence of the % Female on incubation temperature for a clutch of Chelydra serpentina eggs.

A large part of science may be described as the study of the dependence of one measured quantity on another measured quantity. The word function is used in this context in a special way. In previous examples, the word function may have been used as follows: \u00b2The density of V. natrigens is afunction of time. \u00b2Light intensity is a function of depth below the surface in an ocean. \u00b2Light intensity is a function of distance from the light source. \u00b2The frequency of cricket chirps is a function of the ambient temperature. \u00b2The % female turtles from a clutch of eggs is a function of the incubation temperature. 2.2.1 Three de\u00afnitions of \\Function\". Because of its prevalence and importance in science and mathematics, the word function has been de\u00afned several ways over the past three hundred years, and now is usually given a very precise formal meaning. More intuitive meanings are also helpful and we give three de\u00afnitions of function, all of which will be useful to us.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 59 The word variable means a symbol that represents any member of a given set, most often a set of numbers, and usually denotes a value of a measured quantity. Thus density of V. natrigens , time, % female, incubation temperature, light intensity, depth and distance are all variables. The terms dependent variable and independent variable are useful in the description of an experiment and the resulting functional relationship. The density of V. natrigens (dependent variable) is a function of time (independent variable). The % female turtles from a clutch of eggs (dependent variable) is a function of the incubation temperature (independent variable). Using the notion of variable, a function may be de\u00afned: De\u00afnition 2.2.1 Function I Given two variables, xandy, afunction is a rule that assigns to each value of xa unique value of y. In this context, xis the independent variable , and yis the dependent variable . In some cases there is an equation that nicely describes the `rule'; in the % female in a clutch of turtle eggs examples of the preceding section, there was not a simple equation that described the rule, but the rule met the de\u00afnition of function, nevertheless. The use of the words dependent and independent in describing variables may change with the context of the experiment and resulting function. For example, the data on the incubation of turtles implicitly assumed that the temperature was held constant during incubation. For turtles in the wild, however, temperature is not held constant and one might measure the temperature of a clutch of eggs as a function of time. Then, temperature becomes the dependent variable and time is the independent variable. In De\u00afnition 2.2.1, the word `variable' is a bit vague, and `a function is a rule' leaves a question as to `What is a rule?'. A `set of objects' or, equivalently, a `collection of objects', is considered to be easier to understand than `variable' and has broader concurrence as to its meaning. Your previous experience with the word function may have been that De\u00afnition 2.2.2 Function II A function is a rule that assigns to each number in a set called the domain a unique number in a set called the range of the function. De\u00afnition 2.2.2 is similar to De\u00afnition 2.2.1, except that `a number in a set called the domain' has given meaning to independent variable and `a unique number in a set called the range' has given meaning to dependent variable . The word `rule' is at the core of both de\u00afnitions 2.2.1 Function I. and 2.2.2 Function II. and is still a bit vague. The de\u00afnition of function currently considered to be the most concise is: De\u00afnition 2.2.3 Function III Afunction is a collection of ordered number pairs no two of which have the same \u00afrst number. A little re\u00b0ection will reveal that `a table of data' is the motivation for De\u00afnition 2.2.3. A data point is actually a number pair. Consider the tables of data shown in Table 2.1 from V. natrigens growth and human population records. (16,0.036) is a data point. (64,0.169) is a data point. (1950,2.52) and ( 1980,4.45) are data points. These are basic bits of information for the functions. On the other hand, examine the data for cricket chirps in the same table, from Chapter 1. That also is a collection of ordered pairs, but the collection does not satisfy De\u00afnition 2.2.3. There are two ordered pairs in the table with the same \u00afrst term { (66,102) and (66,103). Therefore the collection does not constitute a function. In a function that is a collection of ordered number pairs, the \u00afrst number of a number pair is always a value of the independent variable and a member of the domain and the second number is alwaysCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 60 Table 2.1: Examples of tables of data V. natrigens Growth pH 6.25 Time Population (min) Density 0 0.022 16 0.036 32 0.060 48 0.101 64 0.169 80 0.266World Population Year Population (billions) 1940 2.30 1950 2.52 1960 3.02 1970 3.70 1980 Chirps Temper- Chirps per ature\u00b1F Minute 67 109 73 136 78 160 61 87 66 103 66 102 67 108 77 154 74 144 76 150 a value of the dependent variable and a member of the range. Almost always in recording the results of an experiment, the numbers in the domain are listed in the column on the left and the numbers in the range are listed in the column on the right. Formally, De\u00afnition 2.2.4 Domain and Range For De\u00afnition 2.2.3 of function, the domain is de\u00afned as the set of all numbers that occur as the \u00afrst number in an ordered pair of the function and the range of the function is the set of all numbers that occur as a second number in an ordered pair of the function. Example 2.2.1 Data for the percentage of U.S. population in 1955 that had antibodies to the polio virus as a function of age is shown in Table 2.2.1.1. The domain of the function is the set of all ages of people, although only 14 such ages are listed. The range is contained in the interval of percentages, [0,100], but may not actually exceed 90, say. The data show an interesting fact that a high percentage of the population in 1955 had been infected with polio. A much smaller percentage were crippled or killed by the disease.

The function is the set of all possible ordered pairs associated with the experiment.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 61 Because many biological quantities change with time, the domain of a function of interest is often an interval of time. In some cases a biological reaction depends on temperature (%Females in a clutch of turtle eggs for example) so that the domain of a function may be an interval of temperatures. In cases of spatial distribution of a disease or light intensity below the surface of a lake, the domain may be an interval of distances. It is implicit in the bacteria growth data that at any speci\u00afc time, there is only one value of the absorbance associated with that time. It may be incorrectly or inaccurately read, but a fundamental assumption is that there is only one correct absorbance for that speci\u00afc time. The condition that no two of the ordered number pairs have the same \u00afrst term is a way of saying that each number in the domain has a unique number in the range associated with it. All three of the de\u00afnitions of function are helpful, as are brief verbal descriptions, and we will rely on all of them. Our basic de\u00afnition, however, is the ordered pair de\u00afnition, De\u00afnition 2.2.3. 2.2.2 Simple graphs. Coordinate geometry associates ordered number pairs with points of the plane so that by De\u00afnition 2.2.3 a function is automatically identi\u00afed with a point set in the plane called a simple graph : De\u00afnition 2.2.5 Simple Graph A simple graph is a point set, G, in the plane such that no vertical line contains two points of G. Thedomain ofGis the set of x-coordinates of points of Gand the range ofGis the set of all y-coordinates of points of G. Note: For use in this book, every set contains at least one element. The domain of a simple graph Gis sometimes called the x-projection of G, meaning the vertical projection of Gonto the x-axis and the range of Gis sometimes called the y-projection of Gmeaning the horizontal projection of Gonto the y-axis. A review of the graphs of incubation temperature - % Female turtles in Figure 2.1 and Exercise Fig. 2.1.1 will show that in each graph at least one vertical line contains two points of the graph. Neither of these graphs is a simple graph, but the graphs convey useful information. A circle is not a simple graph. As shown in Figure 2.2A there is a vertical line that contains two points of it. There are a lot of such vertical lines. The circle does contain a simple graph, and contains one that is `as large as possible'. The upper semicircle shown in Figure 2.2B is a simple graph. The points (-1,0) and (1,0) are \u00aflled to show that they belong to it. It is impossible to add any other points of the circle to this simple graph and still have a simple graph | thus it is `as large as possible'. An equation of the upper semicircle is y=p 1\u00a1x2;\u00a11\u00b7x\u00b71 The domain of this simple graph is [-1,1], and the range is [0,1]. Obviously the lower semicircle is aCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 62 maximal simple graph also, and it has the equation y=\u00a1p 1\u00a1x2;\u00a11\u00b7x\u00b71 The domain is again [-1,1], and the range is [-1,0].

A circle; a vertical line contains two point of the circle so that it is not a simple graph. B. A subset of the circle that is a simple graph. C. Another subset of the circle that is a simple graph. The simple graphs in (b) and (c) are maximal in the sense that any point from the circle added to the graphs would create a set that is not a simple graph | the vertical line containing that point would also contain a point from the original simple graph. There is yet a third simple graph contained in the circle, shown in Figure 2.2C, and it is `as large as possible'. An equation for that simple graph is y=(p 1\u00a1x2if\u00a11\u00b7x\u00b70 \u00a1p 1\u00a1x2if 0 < x\u00b71 The domain is [-1,1] and range is [-1,1] Because of the intuitive advantage of geometry, it is often useful to use simple graphs instead of equations or tables to describe functions, but again, we will use any of these as needed.

Exercise 2.2.7 A bit of a di\u00b1cult exercise. For any location, \u00b8on Earth, let Annual Daytime at \u00b8, AD(\u00b8), be the sum of the lengths of time between sunrise and sunset at \u00b8for all of the days of the year. Find a reasonable formula for AD(\u00b8). You may guess or \u00afnd data to suggest a reasonable formula, but we found proof of the validity of our formula a bit arduous. As often happens in mathematics, instead of solving the actual problem posed, we found it best to solve a 'nearby' problem that was more tractable. The 365.24... days in a year is a distraction, the eliptical orbit of Earth is a downright hinderance, and the wobble of Earth on its axis can be overlooked. Speci\u00afcally, we \u00afnd it helpful to assume that there are precisely 366 days in the year (after all this was true about 7 or 8 million years ago), the Earth's orbit about the sun is a circle, the Earth's axis makes a constant angle with the plane of the orbit, and that the rays from the sun to Earth are parallel. We hope you enjoy the question.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 66 2.2.3 Functions in other settings. There are extensions of the function concept to settings where the ordered pairs are not ordered number pairs. A prime example of this is the genetic code shown in Figure 2.3. The relation is a true function (no two ordered pairs have the same \u00afrst term), and during the translation of proteins, the ribosome and the transfer RNA's use this function reliably. 1st position 2nd position 3rd position (5' end) (3' end) #U C A G # Phe Ser Tyr Cys U Phe Ser Tyr Cys C Leu Ser STOP STOP A U Leu Ser STOP Trp G Leu Pro His Arg Pro Ser Thr Ser C Ile Thr Lys Arg A A Met\u00a4Thr Lys Arg G Val Ala Asp Gly U Val Ala Asp Gly C Val Ala Glu Gly A G Val Ala Glu Gly G Figure 2.3: The genetic code (for human nuclear RNA). Sets of three nucleotides in RNA (codons) are translated into amino acids in the course of proteins synthesis. CAA codes for Gln (glutamine).\u00a4AUG codes for Met (methionine) and is also the START codon. Explore 2.2.1 List three ordered pairs of the genetic code. What is the domain of the genetic code? What is the range of the genetic code? The ordered pair concept is retained in the preceding example; the only change has been in the types of objects that are in the domain and range. When the objects get too far a\u00afeld from simple numbers, the word transformation is sometimes used in place of function. The genetic code is a transformation of the codons into amino acids and start and stop signals. Another commonly encountered extension of the kinds of objects in the domain of a function occurs when one physical or biological quantity is dependent on two others. For example, the widely known Charles' Law in Chemistry can be stated as P=nRT VCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 67 where P= pressure in atmospheres, n= number of molecular weights Kelvin-mol = 8.3 /degree T= temperature in kelvins, and V= volume in liters. For a \u00afxed sample of gas, the pressure is dependent on two quantities, temperature and volume. The domain is the set of all feasible temperature-volume pairs, the range is the set of all feasible pressures. The function in this case is said to be a function of two variables. The ordered pairs in the function are of the form ((x; y); z);or ( (temperature ;volume) ;pressure) There may also be multivalued transformations. For example, doctors prescribe antibiotics. For each bacterial infection, there may be more than one antibiotic e\u00aeective against that bacterium; there may be a list of such antibiotics. The domain would be a set of bacteria, and the range would be a set of lists of antibiotics. Exercises for Section 2.2.3 Functions in other settings. Exercise 2.2.8 Describe the domain and range for each of the following transformations. a.Bird identi\u00afcation guide book. b.A judge sentences defendants to jail terms. c.The time between sunrise and sunset. d.Antibiotic side e\u00aeects. 2.3 Function notation. It is common to let a letter denote a set of ordered pairs that is a function. IfFdenotes a function, then for any ordered pair, ( x; y) inF,yis denoted byF(x). Thus the ordered pair ( x; F(x)) is an ordered pair of F. The notation makes it very easy to describe a function by an equation. Instead of 'Let F be the collection of ordered number pairs to which an ordered pair ( x; y) belongs if and only if xis a number and y=x2+x.' one may write 'LetFbe the function such that for all numbers x,F(x) =x2+x.'Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 68 Operationally, you will \u00afnd that often you can simply replace yin an equation by F(x) and de\u00afne a function. Furthermore, because you are used to using yin an equation, you can often replace F(x) in the de\u00afnition of a function by yand use the resulting equation which is more familiar. The following expressions all may be used in the de\u00afnition of a function. (a) F(x) = x2(b) F(x) = x+ 5 (c) F(x) = xx6= (d) F(x) = =px x \u00b80 (f) F(x) = log10x x > 0 Observe that some conditions, x6= 0 and x\u00b80 and x >0, are included for some of the expressions. Those conditions describe the domain of the function. For example, the domain of the function fde\u00afned byF(x) = log10xis the set of positive numbers. You may also see something like F(x) log10(x2\u00a1x) The intention is that the domain is the set of all values of xfor which the expressions can be computed even though no restrictions are written. Often the restrictions are based on these rules: 1.Avoid dividing by zero. 2. Avoid computing the square root of negative numbers. 3. Avoid computing the logarithm of 0 and negative numbers. Assuming we use only real numbers and not complex numbers, complete descriptions of the previous functions would be f(x) =p1 < 0 or 1 < x Use of parentheses. The use of parentheses in the function notation is special to functions and does not mean multiplication. The symbol inside the parentheses is always the independent variable, a member of the domain, and F(x) is a value of the dependent variable, a member of the range. It is particularly tricky in that we will often need to use the symbol F(x+h), and students confuse this with a multiplication and replace it with F(x) +F(h). Seldom is this correct. Example 2.3.1 For the function, R, de\u00afned by R(x) =x+1 xx6= 0Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 69 R(1 + 3) = R(4) = 4 +1 6= 4:25 = R(4) In this case R(1 + 3) 6=R(1) + R(3) Exercises for Section 2.3 Function Notation.

A 1 0 1101 xy B 1 0 1101 xy Exercise 2.3.7 What are the implied Polynomial functions. Data from experiments (and their related functions) are often described as being linear, parabolic, hyperbolic, polynomial, harmonic (sines and cosines), exponential, or logarithmic either because their graphs have some resemblance to the corresponding geometric object or because equations describing their related functions use the corresponding expressions. In this section we extend linear and quadratic equations to more general polynomial functions. De\u00afnition 2.4.1 Polynomial Forna positive integer or zero, a poly- nomial of degree n is a function, Pde\u00afned by an equation of the form P(x) = a0+a1\u00a3x+a2\u00a3x2+a3\u00a3x3+\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2+an\u00a3xn where a0,a1,a2,a3,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2,anare numbers, independent of x, called the coe\u00b1cients of p , and if n >0an6= 0.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 71 Functions of the form P(x) =C where Cis a number are said to be constant functions and also polynomials of degree zero. Functions de\u00afned by equations P(x) quadratic polynomials, respectively, and are polynomials of degree one and degree two. The equation P(x) = 3 + 5 \u00a3x+ 2\u00a3x2+ (\u00a14)\u00a3x3 is a polynomial of degree 3 with coe\u00b1cients 3, 5, 2, and -4 and is said to be a cubic polynomial. Polynomials are important for four reasons: 1.Polynomials can be computed using only the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 2.Most functions used in science have polynomials \\close\" to them over \u00afnite intervals. 3.The sum of two polynomials is a polynomial, the product of two polynomials is a polynomial, and the composition of two polynomials is a polynomial. 4.Polynomials are `linear' in their coe\u00b1cients a fact which makes them suitable for least squares `\u00aft' to data. Reason 1 is obvious, but even the meaning of Reason 2 is opaque. An illustration of Reason 2 follows, and we return to the question in Chapter 9. Sum, product, and composition of two functions are described in Section 2.6. Reason 4 is illustrated in Section 2.5. A tangent to a graph is a polynomial of degree one close to the graph. The graph of F(x) = 2xand the tangent P1(x) = 1 + 0 :69315 x \u00a11\u00b7x\u00b72 at (0,1) are shown in Figure 2.4(a). The graph of the cubic polynomial P3(x) = 1 + 0 :69315 x+ 0:24023 x2+ 0:05550 x3\u00a11\u00b7x\u00b72 shown in Figure 2.4(b) is even closer to the graph of F(x) = 2x. These graphs are hardly distinguishable on\u00a11\u00b7x\u00b71 and only clearly separate at about x= 1:5. The function F(x) = 2xis di\u00b1cult to evaluate (without a calculator) except at integer values of x, but P3(x) can be evaluated with just multiplication and addition. For x= 0:5,F(0:5) = 20:5=p 2 = 1 :41421 and P3(0:5) = 1 :41375. The relative error in using P3(0:5) as an approximation top 2 is Relative Error =\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afP3(0:5)\u00a1F(0:5) F(0:5)\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af=\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af1:41375 \u00a11:41421 1:41421\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af= 0:00033 The relative error is less than 0.04 percent. The tangent P1(x) is a good approximation to F(x) = 2xnear the point of tangency (0,1) and the cubic polynomial P3(x) is an even better approximation. The coe\u00b1cients 0.69135, 0.24023, and 0.05550 are presented here as Lightning Bolts Out of the Blue. A well de\u00afned procedure for selecting the coe\u00b1cients is de\u00afned in Chapter 9.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 72 (a) 1 0 1 201234 (0, 1)y = 2x Tangent xy = = 2x Cubic xy = 2xand tangent at (0,1), P1(x) = 1 + 0 :69315 x.

It is often important to recognize that a function of interest is made up of component parts | other functions that are combined to make up the function of central interest. Researchers monitoring natural populations (deer, for example) partition the dynamics into the algebraic sumof births, deaths, and harvest. Researchers monitoring annual grain production in the United States decompose the production into the product of the number of acres planted and yield per acre. Total Corn Production = Acres Planted to Corn \u00a3Yield per Acre P(t) = A(t)\u00a3Y(t) Factors that in\u00b0uence A(t), the number of acres planted (government programs, projected corn price, alternate cropping opportunities, for example) are qualitatively di\u00aeerent from the factors that in\u00b0uence Y(t), yield per acre (corn genetics, tillage practices, and weather).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 77 2.6.1 Arithmetic combinations of functions. A common mathematical strategy is \\divide and conquer\" | partition your problem into smaller problems, each of which you can solve. Accordingly it is helpful to recognize that a function is composed of component parts. Recognizing that a function is the sum, di\u00aeerence, product, or quotient of two functions is relatively simple. De\u00afnition 2.6.1 Arithmetic Combinations of Functions. If F and G are two functions with common domain, D, The sum, di\u00aeerence, prod- uct, and quotient of F and G are functions, F+G, F-G, F \u00a3G, and F \u00a5 G, respectively de\u00afned by (F+G)(x) = F(x) +G(x) for all x in D (F\u00a1G)(x) = F(x)\u00a1G(x) for all x in D (F\u00a3G)(x) = F(x)\u00a3G(x) for all x in D (F\u00a5G)(x) = F(x)\u00a5G(x) for all x in D with G(x)6= 0 For example F(t) = 2t+t2is the sum of an exponential function, E(t) = 2tand a quadratic function, S(t) =t2. Which of the two functions dominate? Which contributes most to the value of F? Shown in Figure 2.7 are the graphs of EandS. 2 1 0 1 2202468 Graph of E(t) = 2t (a) 2 1 0 1 2202468 Graph of S(t) = t2 (b) Figure 2.7: Graphs of E(t) = 2tandS(t) =t2. Next in Figure 2.8 are the graphs of E+S; E \u00a1S; E \u00a3S; andE S but not necessarily in that order. Which graph depicts which of the combinations of SandE?Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 78 (a) 2 1 0 1 2202468 (b) 1 0 1 2 3 4 5202468 (c) 2 1 0 1 2202468 (d) 2 1 0 1 2202468 Figure 2.8: Graphs of the sum, di\u00aeerence, product, and quotient of E(t) = 2tandS(t) =t2. Note \u00afrst that the domains of EandSare all numbers, so that the domains of E+S,E\u00a1S, and E\u00a3Sare also all numbers. However, the domain of E=S excludes 0 because S(0) = 0 and E(0)=S(0) = 1 =0 is meaningless. The graph in Figure 2.8(c) appears to not have a point on the y-axis, and that is a good candidate forE=S.E(t) and S(t) are never negative, and the sum, product, and quotient of non-negative numbers are all non-negative. However, the graph in Figure 2.8(b) has some points below the x-axis, and that is a good candidate for E\u00a1S. The product, E\u00a3Sis interesting for t <0. The graph of E= 2tis asymptotic to the negative t-axis; astprogresses from 0:5, 1, (\u00a12)2= 3, (\u00a13)2= 9,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2gets very large. What does the product do? 2.6.2 The inverse of a function. Suppose you have a travel itinerary as shown in Table 2.5. If your traveling companion asks, \\What day Table 2.5: Itinerary for (brief) European trip. Day June 1 June 2 June 3 June 4 June 5 June 6 June 7 City London London London Brussels Paris Paris Paris were we in Brussels?\", you may read the itinerary `backward' and respond that you were in Brussels on June 4. On the other hand, if your companion asks, \\I cashed a check in Paris, what day was it?\", you may have di\u00b1culty in giving an answer. An itinerary is a function that speci\u00afes that on day, x, you will be in location, y. You have inverted the itinerary and reasoned that the for the city Brussels, the day was June 4. Because you were in ParisCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 79 June 5 - 7, you can not specify the day that the check was cashed. Charles Darwin exercised an inverse in an astounding way. In his book, On the Various Contrivances by which British and Foreign Orchids are Fertilised by Insects he stated that the angraecoids were pollinated by speci\u00afc insects. He noted that A. sesquipedale in Madagascar had nectaries eleven and a half inches long with only the lower one and one-half inch \u00aflled with nectar. He suggested the existence of a 'huge moth, with a wonderfully long proboscis' and noted that if the moth 'were to become extinct in Madagascar, assuredly the Angraecum would become extinct.' Forty one years later Xanthopan morgani praedicta was found in tropical Africa with a proboscis of ten inches. Such inverted reasoning occurs often. Explore 2.6.1 Answer each of the following by examining the inverse of the function described. a.Rate of heart beat increases with level of exertion; heart is beating at 175 beats per minute; is the level of exertion high or low? b.Resting blood pressure goes up with artery blockage; resting blood pressure is 110 (systolic) `over' 70 (diastolic); is the level of artery blockage high or low? c.Diseases have symptoms; a child is observed with a rash over her body. Is the disease chicken pox? The child with a rash in Example c. illustrates again an ambiguity often encountered with inversion of a function; the child may in fact have measles and not chicken pox. The inverse information may be multivalued and therefore not a function. Nevertheless, the doctor may make a diagnosis as the most probable disease, given the observed symptoms. She may be in\u00b0uenced by facts such as \u00b2Blood analysis has demonstrated that \u00afve other children in her clinic have had chicken pox that week and, \u00b2Because of measles immunization, measles is very rare. It may be that she can actually distinguish chicken pox rash from measles rash, in which case the ambiguity disappears. The de\u00afnition of the inverse of a function is most easily made in terms of the ordered pair de\u00afnition of a function. Recall that a function is a collection of ordered number pairs, no two of which have the same \u00afrst term. De\u00afnition 2.6.2 Inverse of a Function. A function Fis invertible if no two ordered pairs of Fhave the same second number . The inverse of an invertible function, F, is the function Gto which the ordered pair (x,y) belongs if and only if (y,x) is an ordered pair of F. The function, G, is often denoted by F\u00a11. Explore 2.6.2 Do This. Suppose G is the inverse of an invertible function F. What is the inverse of G?Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 80 Table 2.6: Of the two itineraries shown below, the one on the left is invertible. Day Location Day Location June 4 London June 8 Vienna June 5 Amsterdam June 9 Zurich June 6 Paris June 10 Venice June 7 Berlin June 11 RomeDay Location Day Location June 4 London June 8 Zurich June 5 Paris June 9 Zurich June 6 Paris June 10 Rome June 7 Paris June 11 Rome The notation F\u00a11for the inverse of a function Fis distinct from the use of\u00a11as an exponent meaning division, as in 2\u00a11=1 2. In this context, F\u00a11does not mean1 F, even though students have good reason to think so from previous use of the symbol,\u00a11. The TI-86 calculator (and others) have keys marked sin\u00a11and x\u00a11. In the \u00afrst case, the\u00a11signals the inverse function, in the second case the\u00a11 signals reciprocal. Given our desire for uniqueness of de\u00afnition and notation, the ambiguity is unfortunate and a bit ironic. There is some recovery, however. You will see later that the composition of functions has an algebra somewhat like `multiplication' and that `multiplying' by an inverse of a function Fhas some similarity to `dividing' by F. At this stage, however, the only advice we have is to interpret h\u00a11as `divide by h' ifhis a number and as `inverse of h' ifhis a function or a graph. The graph of a function easily reveals whether it is invertible. Remember that the graph of a function is a simple graph , meaning that no vertical line contains two points of the graph. A simple graph Gis the graph of an invertible function if no horizontal line contains two points of G. The simple graph Gin Figure 2.9(a) has two points on the same horizontal line. The points have the same y-coordinate, y1, and thus the function de\u00afning x1; y1) and ( x2; y1) with the same second term. The function is not invertible. The same simple graph Gdoes contain a simple graph that is invertible, as shown as the solid curve in Figure 2.9(b) a. (x1, y1) (x2, y1) b. Figure 2.9: Graph of a function that is not invertible. Explore 2.6.3 Find another simple graph contained in the graph Gof Figure 2.9(a) that is invertible.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 81 Example 2.6.1 Shown in Figure 2.10 is the graph of an invertible function, F, as a solid line and the graph of F\u00a11as a dashed line. Tables of seven ordered pairs of Fand seven ordered pairs of F\u00a11are given. Corresponding to the point, P(3.0,1.4) of Fis the point, Q(1.4,3.0) of F\u00a11. The line y=xis the perpendicular bisector of the interval, PQ. Observe that the domain of F\u00a11is the range of F, and the range of F\u00a11is the domain of F. 00.511.522.533.544.5500.511.522.533.544.55 (1.4,3.0) (3.0,1.4)FF1 Q P F 1.0 0.200 2.10: Graph of a function F(solid line) and its inverse F\u00a11(dashed line) and tables of data for F andF\u00a11.

There\u00b0ection of Gwith respect to the diagonal line, y=xconsists of the points Qsuch that either Qis a point of Gon the diagonal line, or there is a point PofGsuch that the diagonal line is the perpendicular bisector of the interval PQ. The concept of the inverse of a function makes it easier to understand logarithms. Shown in Table 2.7 are some ordered pairs of the exponential function, F(x) = 10xand some ordered pairs of the logarithm function G(x) = log10(x). The logarithm function is simply the inverse of the exponential function. The function F(x) =x2is not invertible. In Figure 2.11 both (-2,4) and (2,4) are points of the graph ofFso that the horizontal line y= 4 contains two points of the graph of F. However, the function S de\u00afned by S(x) =x2forx\u00b80 (2.7) is invertible and its inverse is S\u00a11(x) =px:Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 82 Table 2.7: Partial data for the function F(x) = 10xand its inverse G(x) = log10(x). x10x -20.01 -1 0.1 0 1 1 10 2100 31000xlog10x 0.01 -2 0.1 -1 1 0 10 1 100 2 1000 3 3 2 1 0 1 2 31012345678910 (2, 4) (2, 4) Figure 2.11: Graph of F(x) =x2; (-2,4) and (2,4) are both points of the graph indicating that Fis not invertible. 2.6.3 Finding the equation of the inverse of a function. There is a straightforward means of computing the equation of the inverse of a function from the equation of the function. The inverse function reverses the role of the independent and dependent variables. The independent variable for the function is the dependent variable for the inverse function. To compute the equation for the inverse function, it is common to interchange the symbols for the dependent and independent variables. Example 2.6.2 To compute the equation for the inverse of the function S, S(x) =x2for x\u00b80 let the equation for S be written as y=x2for x\u00b80 Then interchange yandxto obtain x=y2for y\u00b80Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 83 and solve y. x=y2for x\u00b80 The graph of function F(x) = 2 x2\u00a16x+ 3=2 shown in Figure 2.12 has two invertible portions, the left branch and the right branch.

The general picture is that Adepends on B,Bdepends on C, so that Adepends on C. 1.The coyote population is a\u00aeected by a rabbit virus, Myxomatosis cuniculi .The size of a coyote population depends on the number of rabbits in the system; the rabbits are a\u00aeected by the virus Myxomatosis cuniculi ; the size of the coyote population is a function of the prevalence of Myxomatosis cuniculi in rabbits. 2.Heart attack incidence is decreased by low fat diets. Heart attacks are initiated by atherosclerosis, a buildup of deposits in the arteries; in people with certain genetic makeups2, the deposits are decreased with a low fat diet. The risk of heart attacks in some individuals is decreased by low fat diets. 3.You shiver in a cold environment. You step into a cold environment and cold receptors (temperature sensitive nerves with peak response at 30\u00b1C) send signals to your hypothalamus; the hypothalamus causes signals to be sent to muscles, increasing their tone; once the tone reaches a threshold, rhythmic muscle contractions begin. See Figure 2.13. 2see the Web page, http://www.heartdisease.org/Traits.htmlCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 88 4.Severity of allergenic diseases is increasing. Childhood respiratory infections such as measles, whooping cough, and tuberculosis stimulate a helper T-cell, T H1 activity. Increased T H1 activity inhibits T H2 (another helper T-cell) activity. Absence of childhood respiratory diseases thus releases T H2 activity. But T H2 activity increases immunoglobulin E which is a component of allergenic diseases of asthma, hay fever, and eczema. Thus reducing childhood respiratory infections may partially account for the observed recent increase in severity of allergenic diseases3. De\u00afnition 2.7.1 Composition of Functions. If F and G are two functions and the domain of F contains part of the range of G, then the composition of F with G is the function, H, de\u00afned by H(x) =F(G(x)) for all x for which G(x)is in the domain of F The composition, H, is denoted by F\u00b1G. The notation F\u00b1Gfor the composition of (x) =F(G(x)) The parentheses enclosing F\u00b1Ginsures that F\u00b1Gis thought of as a single object (function). The parentheses usually are omitted and one sees F\u00b1G(x) =F(G(x)) Without the parentheses, the novice reader may not know which of the following two ways to group (F\u00b1G) (x) or F\u00b1(G(x)) The experienced reader knows the right hand way does not have meaning, so the left hand way must be correct. In the \\shivering example\" above, the nerve cells that perceive the low temperature are the function Gand the hypothalamus that sends signals to the muscle is the function F. The net result is that the cold signal increases the muscle tone. This relation may be diagrammed as in Figure 2.13. The arrows show the direction of information \u00b0ow. Formulas for function composition. It is helpful to recognize that a complex equation de\u00afning a function is a composition of simple parts. For example H(x) =p 1\u00a1x2 is the al, Science 2751997, 77-79.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 89 G -F Nerve Hypothalamus - -Cold- -ShiveringH Figure 2.13: Diagram of the composition of F{ increase of muscle tone by the hypothalamus { with G{ stimulation from nerve cells by cold. The domain of Gis all numbers but the domain of Fis only z\u00b80 and the domain of F\u00b1Gis only \u00a11\u00b7x\u00b71. The order of function composition is very important. For F(z) =pz and G(x) = = 1 \u00a1(F(z))2= 1\u00a1\u00b3pz\u00b42= 1\u00a1z; and its graph is part of a line (de\u00afned for z\u00b80). Occasionally it is useful to recognize that a function is the composition of three functions, as in K(x) = log(sin( x2)) Kis the composition, F\u00b1G\u00b1Hwhere F(u) = log( u) G(v) = sin( v) H(x) =x2 The composition of F and F\u00a11.The composition of a function with its inverse is special. The case of Theidentity function Iis de\u00afned by I(x) =x forxin a domain D (2.9) where the domain Dis adaptable to the problem at hand. ForF(x) =x2andF\u00a11(x) =px,F\u00b1F\u00a11(x) =F\u00a11\u00b1F(x) =x=I(x), where Dshould be x\u00b80. paragraph we show that F\u00b1F\u00a11=I and F\u00a11\u00b1F=I (2.10) for all invertible functions F. The ordered pair ( a; b) belongs to F\u00a11if and only if ( a) belongs F\u00a11\u00b1F=Iwith possibly a di\u00aeerent domain DforI. Example 2.7.1 Two properties of the logarithm and exponential functions are (a) logbb\u00b8=\u00b8 and (b) u=blogbu The logarithm function, L(x) = logb(x) is the inverse of the exponential function, E(x) =bx, and the properties simply state that L\u00b1E=I andE\u00b1L=I The identity function composes in a special way with other functions. (F\u00b1I)(x) =F(I(x)) I\u00b1F=F Because 1 in the numbers has the property that x\u00a31 =x and 1 \u00a3x=x the number 1 is the identity for multiplication. Sometimes F\u00b1Gis thought of as multiplication also and Ihas the property analogous to 1 of the real numbers. Finally the analogy of x\u00a3x\u00a11=x\u00a31 x= 1 with F\u00b1F\u00a11=I suggests a rationale for the symbol F\u00a11for the inverse of F.

There are many periodic phenomena in the biological sciences. Examples include wingbeat of insects and of birds, nerve action potentials, heart beat, breathing, rapid eye movement sleep, circadian rhythms (sleep-wake cycles), women's menstrual cycle, bird migrations, measles incidence, locust emergence. All of these examples are periodic repetition with time, the variable usually associated with periodicity. The examples are listed in order of increasing period of repetition in Table 2.8. Table 2.8: Characteristic periods of time-periodic biological processes. Biological process Period Biological process Period Insect wingbeat 0.02 sec Circadian cycle (sleep-wake) 1 day Nerve action potential 0.2 sec Menstrual cycle 28 days Heart beat 1 sec Bird migrations 1 year Breathing (rest) 5 sec Measles 2 years REM sleep \u00bc90 min Locust 17 years Tides 6 hours A measurement usually quanti\u00afes the state of a process periodic with time and de\u00afnes a function characteristic of the process. Some examples are shown in Figure 2.14. The measurement may be of physical character as in electrocardiograms, categorical as in stages of sleep, or biological as in measurement of hormonal level. There are also periodic variations with space that result in the color patterns on animals { stripes on zebras and tigers, spots on leopards { , regular spacing of nesting sites, muscle striations, segments in a segmented worm, branching in nerve \u00afbers, and the \u00afve fold symmetry of echinoderms. Some spatially periodic structures are driven by time-periodic phenomena { branches in a tree, annular tree rings, chambers in a nautilus, ornamentation on a snail shell. The pictures in Figure 2.8 illustrate some periodic functions that vary with linear space. The brittle star shown in Figure 2.16 varies periodically with angular change in space. In all instances there is an independent variable, generally time or space, and a dependent variable that is said to be periodic.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 95 A B C D Figure 2.14: Figures demonstrating periodic repetition with time.

A function, F, is said to be periodic if there is a positive number, p, such that for every number xin the domain of F,x+pis also in the domain of Fand F(x+p) =F(x): (2.11) and for each number qwhere 0< q < p there is some xin the domain of Ffor which F(x+q)6=F(x) The period of Fisp. Theamplitude of a periodic function Fis one-half the di\u00aeerence be- tween the largest and least values of F(t), when these values exist.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 96 A B C D Figure 2.15: Figures demonstrating periodic repetition with space.

The condition that `for every number xin the domain of F,x+pis also in the domain of F' implies that the domain of Fis in\u00afnite in extent | it has no upper bound. Obviously, all of the examples that we experience are \u00afnite in extent and do not satisfy De\u00afnition 2.8.1. We will use `periodic' even though we do not meet this requirement. The condition `when these numbers exist' in the de\u00afnition of amplitude is technical and illustrated in Figure 2.17 by the graph of F(t) =t\u00a1[t] where [ t] denotes the integer part of t. ([\u00bc] = 3, [p 30] = 5). There is no largest value of F(t). F(n) =n\u00a1[n] = 0 for integer n Iftis such that F(t) is the largest value of Fthen tis not an integer and is between an integer nand n+ 1. The midpoint that F(t)< F(s), so that F(t) is not the largest value of F.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 97 A B Figure 2.16: A. Periodic distribution of Gannet nests in New Zealand. B.

The function, F(t) =t\u00a1[t] is pretty clearly periodic of period 1, and we might say that its amplitude is 0.5 even though it does not satisfy the de\u00afnition for amplitude. Another periodic function that has no amplitude is the tangent function from trigonometry. Periodic Extension Periodic functions in nature do not strictly satisfy De\u00afnition 2.8.1, but can be approximated with strictly periodic functions over a \u00afnite interval of their domain. Periodic functions in nature also seldom have simple equation descriptions. However, one can sometimes describe the function over one period and then assert that the function is periodic { thus describing the entire function. Example 2.8.1 Electrocardiograms have a very characteristic periodic signal as shown in Figure 2.14. A picture of a typical signal from `channel I' is shown in Figure 2.18; the regions of the signal, P-R, QRS, etc. correspond to electrical events in the heart that cause contractions of speci\u00afc muscles. Is there an equation for such a signal? Yes, a very messy one! The graph of the following equation is shown in Figure 2.18(b). It is similar to the typicalCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 98 (a) (b) 0.50.40.30.20.1 00.10.20.30.40.510.500.511.5 Figure 2.18: (a) Typical signal from an electrocardiogram, created by Agateller (Anthony Atkielski) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography, .

On the TI-86 it was useful to de\u00afne y1 = 25000 andy3 and y4 two terms, then combine y2,y3 and y4 into y5 and select only y5 to graph. The heart beat function Hin Equation 2.12 is not a periodic function and is de\u00afned only for \u00a10:4\u00b7t\u00b70:4. Outside that interval, the expression de\u00afning H(t) is essentially zero. However, we can simultaneously extend the de\u00afnition of Hand make it periodic by H(t) =H(t\u00a10:8) for all t What is the impact of this? H(0:6), say is now de\u00afned, to be H(\u00a10:2). Immediately, Hhas meaning for 0:4\u00b7t\u00b71:2, and the graph is shown in Figure 2.19(a). Now because H(t) has meaning on 0:4\u00b7t\u00b71:2,Halso has meaning on 0 :4\u00b7t\u00b72:0 and the graph is shown in Figure 2.19(b).

Motion of a Spring-Mass System A mass suspended from a spring, when vertically displaced from equilibrium a small amount will oscillate above and below the equilibrium position. A graph of displacement from equilibrium vstime is shown in in Figure 2.21A for a certain system. Critical points of the graph are (2:62 s;72:82 cm) ; (3:18 s;46:24 cm) ; and (3 :79 s;72:80 cm)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 102 A 2.5 3 3.5 4404550556065707580 (2.6,72.8) (3.2,46.2)(3.8,72.8) Time secPosition cm B 0 1.57 3.14 4.71 6.2810.500.51 Figure 2.21: Graphs of A. the motion of a spring-mass system and B. H(x) = cos t. Also shown is the graph of the cosine function, H(t) = cos t. It is clear that the data and the cosine in Figure 2.21 have similar shapes, but examine the axes labels and see that their periods and amplitudes are di\u00aeerent and the graphs lie in di\u00aeerent regions of the plane. We wish to obtain a variation of the cosine function that will match the data. The period of the harmonic motion is 3.79 - 2.62 = 1.17 seconds, the time of the second peak minus the time of the \u00afrst peak. The amplitude of the harmonic motion is 0 :5(72:82\u00a146:24) = 13 :29 cm, one-half the di\u00aeerence of the heights of the highest and lowest points. Now we expect a function of the form H0(t) = 13 :3 cos(2\u00bc 1:17t) to have the shape of the data, but we need to translate vertically and horizontally to match the data. The graphs of H0and the data are shown in Figure 2.22A, and the shapes are similar. We need to match the origin (0,0) with the corresponding point (2.62, 59.5) of the data. We write H(t) = 59 :5 + 13 :3 cos\u00b52\u00bc 1:17(t\u00a12:62)\u00b6 The graphs of Hand the data are shown in Figure 2.22B and there is a good match.

The graph of P3is hardly distinguishable from the graph of Fon the interval [0 ; \u00bc=4], although they do separate near x=\u00bc=2.F(x) = sin xis di\u00b1cult to evaluate (without a calculator) except for special values such as F(0) = sin 0 = 0, F(\u00bc=3) = sin \u00bc=3 = 0 :5 and F(\u00bc=2) = sin \u00bc=2 = 1 :0. However, P3(x) can be calculated using only multiplication, division and subtraction.

The slope of the tangent is approximated by slopes of lines through ( a; F(a)) and points (b; F(b)) when bis close to a. We initiate the use of rate of change to form models of biological systems. (a, F(a))The rate of change of a function F at a number a is the slope of the tangent to the graph of F at the point (a, F(a)). (a, F(a))(b, F(b))As (b, f(b)) approaches (a, f(a)) the slope of the secant through (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) approaches the slope of the tangent to F at (a, F(a)). Calculus is the study of change and rates of change. It has two primitive concepts, the derivative and the integral . Given a function relating a dependent variable to an independent variable, the derivative is the rate of change of the dependent variable as the independent variable changes. We determine the derivative of a function when we answer questions such as 106Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 107 1.Given population size as a function of time, at what rate is the population growing? 2.Given the position of a particle as a function of time, what is its velocity? 3.At what rate does air density decrease with increasing altitude? 4.At what rate does the pressure of one mole of O 2at 300\u00b1K change as the volume changes if the temperature is constant? On the other hand, given the rate of change of a dependent variable as an independent variable changes, the integral is the function that relates the dependent variable to the independent variable. 1.Given the growth rate of a population at all times in a time interval, how much did the population size change during that time interval? 2.Given the rate of renal clearance of penicillin during the four hours following an initial injection, what will be the plasma penicillin level at the end of that four hour interval? 3.Given that a car left Chicago at 1:00 pm traveling west on I80 and given the velocity of the car between 1 and 5 pm, where was the car at 5 pm? The derivative is the subject of this chapter; the integral is addressed in Chapter 13. The derivative and integral are independently de\u00afned. Chapter 13 can be studied before this one and without reference to this one. However, the two concepts are closely related, and the relation between them is The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, developed in Chapter 14. Explore 3.0.2 You use both the derivative and integral concepts of calculus when you cross a busy street. You observe the nearest oncoming car and subconsciously estimate its distance from you and its speed (use of the derivative). You decide whether you have time to cross the street before the car arrives at your position (a simple use of the integral). Might there be a car di\u00aeerent from the nearest car that will a\u00aeect your estimate of the time available to cross the street? You may even observe that the car is slowing down and you may estimate whether it will stop before it gets to your crossing point (involves the integral). Give an example in which estimates of distances and speeds and times are important for successful performance in a sport. 3.1 Tangent to the graph of a function At what rate was the world human population increasing in 1980? Shown in Figure 3.1 are data for the twentieth century and a graph of an approximating function, F. A tangent to the graph of Fat (1980 ; F(1980)) is drawn and has a slope of 0 :0781\u00a3109= 78;100;000 . Now, slope isrise run=change in population change in years\u00bcpeople year: The units of slope, then, are people/year. Therefore, slope = 78 ;100;000people year: The world population was increasing approximately 78,100,000 people per year in 1980.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 108 190019101920193019401950196019701980199020001.522.533.544.555.56 YearWorld Population \u00d7 109 Figure 3.1: Graph of United Nations estimates of world human population for the twentieth century, an approximating curve, and a tangent to the curve.

De\u00afnition 3.1.1 Rate of change of a function at a point. The rate of change of a function, F, at a number ain its domain is the slope of the line that is tangent to the graph of Fat the point ( a; F(a)), if there is a tangent. To be of use, De\u00afnition 3.1.1 requires a de\u00afnition of tangent to a graph which is given below in De\u00afnition 3.1.2. In some cases there will be no tangent. In each graph shown in Figure 3.2 there is no tangent at the point (3,2) of the graph. Students usually agree that there is no tangent in graphs A and B, but sometimes argue about case C.

In Figure 3.3C, however, the line shown is not the tangent line. The graphs in B and C are the same and the tangent is the line drawn in B. A 0 1 2 3 4 5 6151050510 (2, 4) B 1 2 3 402468 (2, 4) C 1 2 3 402468 (2, 4) Figure 3.3: All of these graphs have a tangent to the graph at the point (2,4). However, the line drawn in C is not the tangent. A line tangent to the graph of Fat a point ( a; F(a)) contains ( a; F(a)) so in \u00afnd the tangent we only need to \u00afnd the slope of the tangent, which we denote by ma. To \u00afnd mawe consider points bin the domain of Fthat are di\u00aeerent from aand compute the slopes, F(b)\u00a1F(a) b\u00a1a; ( F(b)) is called of the graph of F. The slope,F(b)\u00a1F(a) b\u00a1a, of the secant is a 'good' approximation to the slope of the tangent when bis 'close to' a. A graph, a tangent to the graph, and a secant to the graph are shown in Figure 3.4. If we could animate that \u00afgure, we would slide the point ( b; F(b)) along the curve towards (a; F(a)) and show the secant moving toward the tangent. A substitute for this animation is shown in Figure 3.5. Three points are shown, and b3are progressively closer to a, and the slopes of the dashed lines from B1,B2, and B3to (a,F(a)) are progressively closer to the slope of the tangent to the graph of Fat (a; F(a)). Next look at the magni\u00afcation of Fin Figure 3.5B. The progression toward acontinues with b3,b4, and b5, and the slopes from B3,B4, and B5 to (a; F(a)) move even closer to the slope of the tangent. Explore 3.1.3 It is important in Figure 3.5 that Would this be true in Figure 3.2B?Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 110 TangentSecant (a, f(a))(b, f(b)) Figure 3.4: A graph, a tangent to the graph, and a secant to the graph. De\u00afnition 3.1.2 Tangent to a graph. Suppose the domain of a function Fcontains an open interval that contains a number a. Suppose further that there is a number masuch that that for points bin the interval di\u00aeerent from a, asbapproaches aF(b)\u00a1F(a) b\u00a1aapproaches ma: Then of (a; F(a)). The graph of y= F(a) +ma(x\u00a1a) is the tangent to the graph of Fat (a; F(a)). We are making progress. We now have a de\u00afnition of tangent to a graph and therefore have given meaning to rate of change of a function. However, we must make sense of the phrase asbapproaches aF(b)\u00a1F(a) b\u00a1aapproaches ma: This phrase is a bridge between geometry and analytical computation and is formally de\u00afned in De\u00afnition 3.2.1. We \u00afrst use it on an intuitive basis. Some students prefer an alternate, similarly intuitive statement: ifbis close to aF(b)\u00a1F(a) b\u00a1ais close to ma: Both phrases are helpful.

Furthermore, the rate of change of F(t) =t2atais 2a. This is the \u00afrst of many examples. Explore 3.1.4 Do this. Use your intuition to answer the following questions.

One may look for an answer to c., for example, by choosing a number, b, close to 5 and computing 3b+b3. Consider 4.99 which some would consider close to 5. Then 3 \u00a34:99 + 4 :993is 139.22. 4.99999 is even closer to 5 and 3 \u00a34:99999 + 4 :999993is 139.99922. One may guess that 3 b+b3is close to 140 if bis close to 5. Of course in this case 3 b+b3can be evaluated for b= 5 and is 140. The approximations seem super\u00b0uous.

Almost 200 years after Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz introduced calculus (about 1665), Karl Weierstrass introduced (about 1850) a concise statement of limit that clari\u00afes the phrase. Phrase 3.2 would be rewritten The limit as bapproaches aofF(b)\u00a1F(a) b\u00a1aisma: (3.3) We introduce notation separate from that of the phrase 3.2 because 'limit' has application well beyond its use in de\u00afning tangents. De\u00afnition 3.2.1 De\u00afnition of limit. Suppose Gis a function, ais a number, ( p; q) is an open interval that contains a, and the domain of G contains every point of ( p; q) except a. Also suppose Lis a number. The statement that asxapproaches a G(x) approaches L means that if \u00b2is a positive number, there is a positive number \u00b1such that if xis in the domain of Gand 0 <jx\u00a1aj< \u00b1thenjG(x)\u00a1Lj< \u00b2. This relation is denoted by is read, 'The xapproaches aofG(x) isL.' The statement that 'limx!aG(x) exists' means that Gis a function, an open interval ( p; q) contains a number a, the domain of Gcontains all of ( p; q) except aand for some number L, limx!aG(x) The use of the word 'limit' in De\u00afnition 3.2.1 is di\u00aeerent from its usual use as a bound, as in 'speed limit' or in \"1. the point, line or edge where something ends or must end; \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2\" (Webster's new College Dictionary, Fourth Edition). Perhaps 'goal' (something aimed at or striven for) would be a better word, but we and you have no choice: assume a new and well de\u00afned meaning for 'limit.' Important. In De\u00afnition 3.2.1, the question of whether G(a) is de\u00afned is irrelevant, and if G(a) is de\u00afned, the value of G(a) is irrelevant. The inequality 0 <jx\u00a1aj< \u00b1speci\u00afcally excludes consideration ofx=a. Two illustrative examples appear in Figure 3.10. They are the graphs of F1andF2, de\u00afned by 1 for and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 123 Intuitively: Ifxis close to 1 and di\u00aeerent from 1 ,F1(x) =1 2xis close to 0.5 and F2(x) is close to 0.5.

That F2(1) = 1 does not change the argument because 0 <jx\u00a11j< \u00b1 excludes x= 1. Example 3.2.1 Practice with \u00b2's and \u00b1's. 1. Suppose administration of a= 3:5 mg of growth hormone produces the optimum serum hormone level L= 8:1\u00b9g in a 24 kg boy. Suppose further that an amount xmg of growth hormone produces serum hormone level G(x)\u00b9g. You may wish to require \u00b2= 1:5\u00b9g accuracy in serum hormone levels, and need to know what speci\u00afcation \u00b1mg accuracy to require in preparation of the growth hormone to be administered. That is, if the actual amount administered is between 3 :5\u00a1\u00b1mg and 3 :5 +\u00b1mg then the resulting serum hormone level will be between 8 :1\u00a11:5\u00b9g and 8 :1 + 1 :5\u00b9g. If instead, your tolerance is \u00b2= 0:5\u00b9g, the speci\u00afed \u00b1mg would be smaller. 2. Show that if ais a positive number, then limx!apx=pa (3.6) Suppose \u00b2 >0.

Suppose you try to 'square the circle.' That is, suppose you try to construct a square the area of which is exactly the area, \u00bc, of a circle of radius 1. A famous problem from antiquity is whether one can construct such a square using only a straight edge and a compass. The answer is no. But can you get close? Suppose you will be satis\u00afed if the area of your square is within 0.01 of \u00bc(think, \u00b2= 0:01). It helps to know that \u00bc= 3:14159265 \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2; and 1 :772= 3:1329; and that every interval of rational length (for example, 1.77) can be constructed with straight edge and compass. Because 1 :772= 3:1329 is within 0.01 of \u00bc, you can 'almost' square the circle with straight edge and compass. Explore 3.2.1 Suppose you are only satis\u00afed if the area of your square is within 0.001 of \u00bc. What length should the edges of your square be in order to achieve that accuracy? Now suppose \u00b2is a positive number and ask, how close (think, \u00b1) must your edge be top\u00bcin order to insure that jthe area of your square \u00a1\u00bcj< \u00b2 ? Letxbe the length of the side of your square. Your problem is to \u00afnd \u00b1so that ifjx\u00a1p\u00bcj< \u00b1; then jx2\u00a1\u00bcj< \u00b2:Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 126 Danger: This may fry your brain. Look at the \u00b2and \u00afrst of all that 0 < x < 5. (We get to write the speci\u00afcations for x.) Then x+p\u00bc <10. (Actually,p\u00bc:= 1:7725 so that x+p\u00bcis less than 7, but we can be generous.) Now look at our target, jx2\u00a1\u00bcj=jx\u00a1p\u00bcj \u00a3 jx+p\u00bcj< \u00b2 If we insist that jx\u00a1p\u00bcj< \u00b1= Minimum( \u00b2=10;1), then 0 < x Explore 3.2.2 We required that 0 < x < 5. (We get to write the speci\u00afcations for x.) Would it work to require that 0 < x < 1? Using the de\u00afnition of limit we rewrite the de\u00afnitions of tangent to the graph of a function and the rate of change of a function. De\u00afnition 3.2.2 De\u00afnition of tangent and rate of change, revis- ited. Suppose a function Fis de\u00afned on an open interval that contains a point aandmais a number. The statement that the slope of the tangent to the graph of Fat (a; F(a)) ismaand that the rate of change of Fat aismameans that lim b!aF(b)\u00a1F(a) b\u00a1a=ma: (3.7) In the previous section we found that the slope of the tangent to the graph of F(t) =t2at a point (a; a2) was 2 a. Using the limit notation we would write that development as lim b!aF(b)\u00a1F(a) b\u00a1a= lim b!ab2\u00a1a2 b!a(b+a) =a+a= 2aCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 127 There is some algebra of the limit symbol, limx!a, that is important. Suppose each of F1andF2is a function and ais a number and limx!aF1(x) and limx!aF2(x) both exist. Suppose further that Cis a number. Then limx!aC=C (3.8) limx!ax=a of these equations are su\u00b1ciently intuitive that proofs of them seem super\u00b0uous. Equations 3.8 and 3.9 could be more accurately expressed. For Equation 3.8 one might say, \"IfF1(x) =Cfor if x6=a = 1 Is it true that limx!aF1(x) =C? Explore 3.2.4 Write a more accurate expression for Equation 3.9 similar to that of 3.15. Proof of Equations 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12 are rather easy and are included to illustrate the process. Proof of Equation 3.10 . Suppose a6= 0 and \u00b2 a positive number. Case C= 0. Let \u00b1= 1.

Almost always in evaluating limx!aF(x); ifFis a familiar function and F(a) is de\u00afned then limx!aF(x) =F(a):Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 129 If this happens, Fis said to be continuous ata(more about continuity later). It follows from Equations 3.8 through 3.13, for example, that ifP(x) is any polynomial, then limx!aP(x) =P(a): See Exercise 3.2.7. Moreover, even if F(a) is not meaningful but there is an expression E(x) for which F(x) =E(x) for x6=a;and E(a) is For example, for F(x) =x4\u00a1a4 x\u00a1a; F limx!aF(x) = 4 a3: The simple procedure just discussed fails when considering more complex limits such as lim x!0sinx x; lim x!1logx x\u00a11; and lim x!12x\u00a12 x\u00a11: Limit of the composition of two functions. A formula for the limit of the composition of two functions has very broad application. Suppose uis a function, Lis a number, ais in the domain of u, and there is an open interval ( p; q) in the domain of uthat contains aand if xis in ( p; q) and is not athen u(x)6=L. Suppose further that limx!au(x) =L Suppose Fis a function and for xin (p; q),u(x) is in the domain of F, and lim s!LF(s) =\u00b8: Then limx!aF(u(x)) =\u00b8 (3.16)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 130 Intuitively, if xis close to but distinct from a, then u(x) is close to but distinct from LandF(u(x)) is close to \u00b8. The formal argument is perhaps easier than the statement of the property, but is omitted.

Then the function F0(read ' Fprime') is de\u00afned by F0(x) = the rate of change of Fatx (3.19) for all numbers xin the domain of Ffor which the rate of change of F atxexists. Alternatively, we may write F0(x) = lim b!xF(b)\u00a1F(x) b\u00a1x: (3.20) The function F0is called the derivative3ofF(the function derived from F). When the independent variable of Fis expressed as in F(x),F0(x) is the derivative of F(x) with respect to x. The derivative is one-half of calculus, perhaps 4 percent of your univer- sity education, and requires your attention. The next 200? pages of this text present biological and physical interpretations of the derivative, for- mulas for computing the derivatives of commonly encountered functions, and uses of derivatives in writing equations for mathematical models of biological and physical systems. Example 3.3.1 You found in Chapter 1, Problem 1.9.1 on page 48 that light intensity, L, at a distance, d, from a linear slit of light was L(d) =1:45 d3\u00b7d\u00b716 where Lwas measured in mW/cm2anddwas measured in cm. At what rate is the light decreasing when d= 5 cm? We \u00afnd the derivative of L. For any value of d between 3 and 16 cm, L0(d) = lim b!dL(b)\u00a1L(d) mW/cm2 b\u00a1dcm = \u00a11:451 d\u00a3b\u00b6mW/cm2 3Joseph-Louis Lagrange (a French mathematician of Italian descent, 1736-1813) used the word `derivative', and may have been the \u00afrst to do so (H.

The question of units on the rate of change is important. We have used the following. Units on F0 If limx!aG(x) =L; then the units on Lare the units on G. It follows that the units on F0(x) = lim b!xF(b)\u00a1F(x) b\u00a1x are the units on Fdivided by the the units on the domain of F(the units on x). \u00b2IfF(t) is distance in meters and tis time in seconds, then F0(t) is meters per second, or velocity.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 136 \u00b2IfF(x) is pressure in atmospheres and xis altitude in km, then F0(x) is commonly called the pressure gradient and is measured in atm/km. \u00b2IfF(t) is population size in individuals and tis time in years, then F0(t) is population growth rate (which might be negative) in individuals per year. It is useful to see the rate of change of Fover the whole domain of F. In Figure 3.12A is the graph of a function, called a logistic function, that is typical of the size of population that starts at low density and grows in a limited environment. At time t= 0 the population size is P(0) = 1 and the maximum supportable population is M= 10. Its derivative is shown in 3.12B and illustrates population growth rate. The maximum of the derivative occurs at t= 3:15 and this marks the steepest part of the population graph. The growth rate initially is low, rises to a maximum at t= 3:15, and decreases again as population density nears its maximum.

We claim that graph 1 is not P, because every tangent to graph 1 has negative slope and some y-coordinates of graph 2 are positive. Therefore graph 2 must be the graph of P. Alternate notation. Calculus originated in England with Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and in Germany with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), and indeed some elements of it were anticipated by the Greek mathematicians. Given the multiple origins and a 300 year history, it is not surprising that there are several notations for derivative. Newton used y0for the `\u00b0uxion' of y(rate of change of y). But when the independent variable was time, Newton used the symbol _ yfor the rate of change of yand \u00c4yfor the second derivative of y(the derivative of the derivative of y). Therefore if ydenotes distance, _ y denotes velocity and \u00c4 ydenotes acceleration. The most common notation,dF dt, for the derivative was introduced and used by Leibnitz. When discussing the rate of change of Fat a aone may see F0(a) ordF dx\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af x=aordF dxor _F function that has derivative is called a di\u00aeerentiable function. To di\u00aeerentiate Fmeans to compute the derivative, F0. \\Di\u00aeerentiable\" comes from the concept of a `di\u00aeerential' which is a cousin of an elusive concept called `in\u00afnitesimal'. An in\u00afnitesimal is a positive number that is less than all other positive numbers, which is possible only in an extension of the number system that we commonly use. An in\u00afnitesimal change, dx, inxcauses an in\u00afnitesimal change, dF, inF(x) and the derivative is the ratiodF dx. The concept of a limit is considered to be less mysterious than is in\u00afnitesimal, and can easily be put on a quite sound footing, whereas it is di\u00b1cult to de\u00afne `in\u00afnitesimal' clearly4.

Compare the slope of the graph of Sat the point ( a; a2),a >0 with the slope of the graph of Rat the corresponding point ( a2; a). Figure for Exercise 3.3.8 Graphs R(t) = = t2 The next two exercises explore the re\u00b0ective property of a parabola which asserts that light rays originating from the focal point of a parabola will strike the parabola and be re\u00b0ected in a direction parallel to the axis of the parabola. We choose the parabola that is the graph of y= 2p twhich has (1,0) as its focal point and x=\u00a11 as its directrix. Exercise 3.3.9 Shown in Figure Ex. 3.3.9 is the graph of y= 2p tand a ray emanating vertically from the focal point at (1,0) and re\u00b0ected (apparently horizontally) by the tangent to the parabola at (1,2).

See Exercise 2 t0.5TAB C(a, 2 a0.5 ) 3.4 Mathematical models using the derivative. The rate of change of a function provides a powerful new way of thinking about models of biological processes. The changes in biological and physical properties that were measured in dis- crete packages ( Pt+1\u00a1Pt,At+1\u00a1At,It+1\u00a1It) in Chapter 1 can be more accurately represented as instantaneous rates of change ( P0(t),A0(t),I0(t)) us- ing the derivative. The V. natrigens populations were measured at 16 minute intervals but were growing continuously. The kidneys \u00aflter continuously, not in 5-minute spurts. Here we begin a process of using the derivative to interpret mathematical models that continues through out the book. 3.4.1 Mold growth. We wrote in Section 1.5 that the daily increase in the area of a mold colony is proportional to the circumference of the colony at the beginning of the day. Alternatively, we might say: Mathematical Model 3.4.1 Mold growth. The rate of increase in the area of the mold colony at time tis proportional to the circumference of the colony at time t.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 143 Letting A(t) be area and C(t) be circumference of the mold colony at time t, we would write A0(t) =k\u00a3C(t) Because C(t) = 2p\u00bcq is a statement about the function A. We recall also that the area of the colony on day 0 was 4 mm2. Now we search for a function Asuch that A(0) = 4 A0(t) =Kq A(t) t\u00b80 (3.23) Warning: Incoming Lightning Bolt. Methodical ways to search for functions satisfying conditions such as Equations 3.23 are described in Chapter 16. At this stage we only write that the function A(t) =\u00b5K 2t+ 2\u00b62 t\u00b80 Bolt Out of Chapter 16. (3.24) satis\u00afes Equations 3.23 and is the only such function. In Exercise 3.6.6 you are asked to con\u00afrm that A(t) of Equation 3.24 is a solution to Equation 3.23. Finally, we use an additional data point, A(8) = 266 to \u00afnd an estimate of 2t+ ( 1 :79t+ 2)2describes the area of the mold colony for times 0 \u00b7t\u00b79. Furthermore, A has a quadratic expression as suggested in Section 1.5 based on a discrete model. A graph of the original data and Aappears in Figure 3.14. 3.4.2 Chemical kintetics. Chemists use the rate of change in the amount of product from a chemical reaction as a measure of the reaction rate . You will compute some rates of chemical reactions from discrete data of chemical concentration vstime. Chemical reactions in which one combination of chemicals changes to another are fundamental to the study of chemistry. It is important to know how rapidly the reactions occur, and to know what factors a\u00aeect the rate of reaction. A reaction may occur rapidly as in an explosive mixture of chemicalsCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 144 1 012345678910050100150200250300350 Time daysArea of Mold Colony mm2 Figure 3.14: Graph of A(t) = ( 1 :79t+ 2 )2and the area of a mold colony from Table 1.5 or slowly, as when iron oxidizes on cars in a junk yard. Temperature and concentration of reactants often a\u00aeect the reaction rate; other chemicals called catalysts may increase reaction rates; in many biological processes, there are enzymes that regulate the rate of a reaction. Consider A\u00a1!B to represent (part of) a reaction in which a reactant, A, changes to a product, B. The rate of the reaction may be measured as the rate of disappearance of A or the rate of appearance of B. Butyl chloride. When butyl chloride, C 4H9Cl, is placed in water, the products are butyl alcohol and hydrochloric acid. The reaction is C4H9Cl + H 2O\u00a1!C4H9OH + H++ Cl\u00a1 As it takes one molecule of C 4H9Cl to produce one atom of Cl\u00a1, the rate at which butyl chloride disappears is the same as the rate at which hydrochloric acids appears. The presence of Cl\u00a1may be measured by the conductivity of the solution. Two students measured the conductivity of a solution after butyl chloride was added to water, and obtained the results shown in Figure 3.15. The conductivity probe was calibrated with 8.56 mmol NaCl, and conductivity in the butyl chloride experiment was to mmol Cl\u00a1. The experiment began with butyl chloride being added to water to yield 9.6 mmol butyl chloride. The average rate of change over the time interval [30,40] m30;40=1:089\u00a10:762 40\u00a130= 0:0327; and the average rate of change over the time interval [40,50] m40;50=1:413\u00a11:089 50\u00a140= 0:0324:Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, sec mmol sec 140 3.255 70 2.015 150 3.355 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 1600.500.511.522.533.5 Time secConcentration Cl mmol Figure 3.15: Conductivity of chloride solution at times after butyl chloride was added to water. both approximate the reaction rate. A better estimate is the average of these two numbers, 0:0327+0 :0324 2= 0:03255. We only use the average when the backward and forward time increments, -10 seconds and +10 seconds, are of the same magnitude. The average can be computed without computing either of the backward or forward average rates, as m30;50=1:413\u00a10:762 50\u00a130= 0:03255 In the case of t= 150, knowledge of the forward time increment is not available, and we use the backward time increment only. m140;150=3:355\u00a13:255 150\u00a1140= 0:01 Explore 3.4.1 Estimate the reaction rate at time t= 80 seconds. Example 3.4.1 It is useful to plot the reaction rate vsthe concentration of Cl\u00a1as shown in Figure 3.16. The computed reaction rates for times t= 0, 10, \u00a2\u00a2\u00a240 are less than we expected. At these times, the butyl chloride concentrations are highest and we expect the reaction rates to also be highest. Indeed, we expect the rate of the reaction to be proportional to the butyl chloride concentration. If so then the relation between reaction rate and C l\u00a1concentration should be linear, as in the parts corresponding to times t= 60, 70, \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2160 s. The line in Figure 3.16 has equation y= 0:0524\u00a10:0127x. We can not explain the low rate of appearance of C l\u00a1at this time. The reaction is not quite so simple as represented, for if butyl alcohol is placed in hydrochloric acid, butylchloride and water are produced. You may see from the data that the molarity of Cl\u00a1is tapering o\u00ae and indeed later measurements showed a maximum Cl\u00a1concentration of 3.9 mmol.

There is a reverse reaction and the total reaction may be represented C4H9Cl(aq) + H 2O(l)k1 \u00a1! \u00c3\u00a1 k2C4H9OH(aq) + H++ Cl\u00a1(aq) The numbers, k1andk2, called rate constants of the reaction. The number k1is the negative of the slope of the line computed in Example 3.4.1 (that is, 0.0127). Exercises for Section 3.4 Mathematical models using the derivative.

Polynomials, Sum and Constant Factor Rules We begin a common strategy to \u00afnd derivatives of functions: \u00b2Use De\u00afnition 3.2.2 to \u00afnd the (such as F(t) =C,F(t) =t, and formulas . \u00b2Use De\u00afnition 3.2.2 to prove some rules about derivatives of com- binations of functions. \u00b2Use the combination rules and primary formulas to compute deriva- tives of more complex functions. We are using the symbol tfor the independent variable. We could as well use xas in previous sections, but time is a common independent variable in biological models and we wish to use both symbols. The following are derivative formulas for this section.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 149 Primary formulas: First Set IfCis a number and nis a positive integer and u,v, and Fare functions with a common domain, D, then If for all t; F (t) =Cthen F0(t) = 0 Constant Rule If for all t; F (t) =tthen F0(t) = 1 t Rule If for all t; F (t) =tnthen F0(t) =ntn\u00a11tnRule Combination Rules: First Set (t) =u(t) +v(t) then F0(t) =u0(t) u(t) then F0(t) =C u0(t) Constant Factor Rule We use a notation that simpli\u00afes the statements of the rules. An example is IfF(t) =t4then F0(t) = 4 t3is =H(t) is to [ E(t) ]0=H(t): Alternatively, we may use Leibnitz' notation and write d dt[E(t) ] =H(t): The \u00afrst set of rules may be written,Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 150 Derivative Rules: First Set [C]0= 0 Constant Rule (3.25) [t]0= Factor Rule (3.29) The short forms depend on your recognizing that Cis a constant, tis an independent variable, nis a positive integer, and that uandvare functions with a common domain, and that Fis a function. The distinction between [ C]0= 0 and [ t]0= 1 is that the symbol0means rate of change as t changes , sometimes said to be derivative with respect to t .Cdenotes a number that does not change with tand therefore its rate of change as tchanges is zero. The Leibnitz notation,d dt, is read, 'derivative with respect to t', and gives a better distinction between these two formulas. Explore 3.5.1 Write short forms of the \u00afrst set of derivative rules using the Leibnitz notation,d dt. Proofs of the Derivative Rules: First Set. You have su\u00b1cient experience that you can prove each of these rules using the De\u00afnition of Derivative3.20. We prove the tnRule and the Sum Rule and leave the others for you in Exercise 3.5.4. Explore 3.5.2 The steps of the arguments for the Sum Rule and the Constant Factor Rule will be made apparent if you use De\u00afnition of Derivative 3.20 to compute the derivatives of P(t) =t2+t3and P(t) = 4 t2 tnRule. Suppose nis a integer and a function Fis de\u00afned by F(t) = lim b!tF(b)\u00a1F(t) b\u00a1tCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 151 = lim b!tbn\u00a1tn b\u00a1t = lim b!t(b\u00a1t)(bn\u00a11+bn\u00a12t+\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2+btn\u00a12+tn\u00a11) tn\u00a11 We have stated and proved the tnRule assuming that nis a positive integer. It is also true for na negative integer when t6= 0 (Exercise 3.5.5). When tis restricted to being greater than zero, the tnrule is valid for every number n(integer, rational, and irrational). You will prove it for rational numbersp q,p andqintegers in the Chapter 4, Exercise 4.3.4. Meanwhile, we encourage you to use formulas such as h t\u00a15i0=\u00a15t\u00a15\u00a11=\u00a15t\u00a16;h t5=3i0=5 3t(5=3)\u00a11=5 3t2=3; and even [ t\u00bc]0=\u00bct\u00bc\u00a11: Sum Rule. Suppose you and your lab partner are growing two populations of Vibrio natrigens , one growing at the rate of 4 :32\u00a3105cells per minute and the other growing at the rate of 2 :19\u00a3105cells per minute. It is a fairly easy conclusion that the growth rate of all V. natrigens in the two populations is 4:32\u00a3105plus 2 :19\u00a3105= 6:51\u00a3105cells per minute. It is your experience that rates are additive, and we will include a proof. The proof is needed to distinguish the intuitive for addition from the non-intuitive for multiplication. Many students `intuitively think' that rates are multiplicative, and they are not! Proof. Suppose uandvare functions with a common domain, D, and for all tinD,F(t) =u(t) +v(t). has a companion, the di\u00aeerence rule, [u(t)\u00a1v(t) ]0=u0(t)\u00a1v0(t)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 152 that we also call the sum rule. of these possibilities. Use of the derivative rules. Using the \u00afrst set of derivative rules, we can compute the derivative of any polynomial without explicit reference to the De\u00afnition of Derivative 3.20, as the following example illustrates. Example 3.5.1 LetP(t) = 3 t4\u00a15t2+ +2 t+ [ t4]0\u00a15 [t2]0+ 2 Rule = 3\u00a34t3\u00a15\u00a32t1+ 2 [t]0[7]0tnRule 12 t3\u00a110t+ 2\u00a31 + [7]0t Rule = 12 t3\u00a110t+ 2 + 0 Constant Rule Example 3.5.2 It is useful to write some fractions in forms so that the Constant Factor Rule obviously applies.

P0(t) =\u00b7 1 + 2t3 Example 3.5.3 The derivative of a quadratic function is a linear function. Solution. Suppose P(t) =at2+bt+cwhere a,b, and care constants. see that P0(t) = 2 at+bwhich is a linear function. 3.5.1 Velocity as a derivative. IfP(t) denotes the position of a particle along an axis at time t, then for any time interval [ a; b], P(b)\u00a1P(a) b\u00a1a is the average velocity of the particle during the time interval [ a; b]. The rate of change of Patt=a, lim b!aP(b)\u00a1P(a) b\u00a1a; is the velocity of the particle at time t=a.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 154 Example 3.5.4 In baseball, a `pop \u00b0y' is hit and the ball leaves the bat traveling vertically at 30 meters per second. How high will the ball go and how much time does the catcher have to get in position to catch it? Solution. Using a formula from Section 3.6.1, the ball will be at a height s(t) =\u00a14:9t2+ 30tmeters tseconds after it is released, where s(t) is the height above the point of impact with the bat. The velocity, v(t) =s0(t) is [s(t) ]0=h \u00a14:9t2+ 30ti0=\u00a14:9\u00a32t+ 30\u00a31 =\u00a19:8t+ 30 The ball will be at its highest position when the velocity v(t) =s0(t) = 0 (which implies that the ball is not moving and identi\u00afes the time at which the ball is at its highest point, is not going up and is not going down). s0(t) = 0 implies \u00a19:8t+ 30 = 0 ; or t=30 9:8\u00bc3:1 seconds : The height of the ball at t= 3:1 seconds is s(3:1) =\u00a14:9 (3:1)2+ 30\u00a33:1\u00bc45:9 meters Thus in about 3.1 seconds the ball reaches a height of about 45.9 meters. The catcher will have about 6 seconds to position to catch the ball. Furthermore, at time t= 6:2 s0(6:2) =\u00a19:8\u00a36:2 + 30 = \u00a130:76 meters/second : velocity of the falling ball is \u00bc \u00a130:76 m/s when the catcher catches it. Its magnitude will be exactly 30 m/s, the speed at which it left the bat. 3.5.2 Local Maxima and Local Minima. Example 3.5.4 illustrates a useful technique that will be expanded in the next chapter: if one is seeking the high point of a graph, it is useful to examine the points at which the derivative of the related function is zero and the tangent is horizontal. However, tangents at local minima are also horizontal, so that knowing the location of a horizontal tangent does not insure that the location is a local maximum { it might be a local minimum or it may be neither a local minimum nor a local maximum! Shown in Figure 3.17A is the graph of a function and two horizontal tangents to the graph. The horizontal tangent at Amarks a local maximum of the graph, the tangent at Bmarks a local minimum of the graph. Ais a `local' maximum because in an interval surrounding A,Ais the highest point, but note that there are points of the graph above A. In Figure 3.17B is the graph of P(t) =t3which has a horizontal tangent at (0,0). The horizontal tangent at (0 ;0), however, signals neither a local maximum nor a local minimum. Example 3.5.5 A farmer's barn is 60 feet long on one side. He has 100 feet of fence and wishes to build a rectangular pen along that side of his barn. What should be the dimensions of the pen to maximize the area? A diagram of a barn and fence with some important labels, LandW, is shown in Figure 3.18.

Barn 60 ft WL Figure 3.18: Diagram of a barn with adjacent pen bounded by a fence of length 100 feet. The area, A, is A=L\u00a3W Because 2 W+L= 100, L= 100 \u00a12W and A=L\u00a3W= (100 \u00a12W)\u00a3W or A= 100 W\u00a12W2 The question becomes now, for what value of WwillAbe the largest. The graph of AvsWis a parabola with its highest point at the vertex. The tangent to the parabola at the vertex is horizontal,Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 156 and we \u00afnd a value of Wfor which A0(W) = 0. A0(W) >>>>>>>>>>>= >>>>>>>>>>>;(3.31) The optimum dimensions, WandL, are found by setting A0(W) = 0, so that A0(W) = 100 \u00a14W= 0 W= 25 L= 100 \u00a12W= 50 Thus the farmer should build a 25 by 50 foot pen. Example 3.5.6 This problem is written on the assumption, to our knowledge untested, that spider webs have an optimum size. Seldom are they so small as 1 cm in diameter and seldom are they so large as 2 m in diameter. If they are one cm in diameter, there is a low probability of catching a \u00b0ying insect; if they are 2 m in diameter they require extra strength to withstand wind and rain. We will examine circular webs, for convenience, and determine the optimum diameter for a web so that it will catch enough insects and not fall down. Solution. Assume a circular spider web of diameter, d. It is reasonable to assume that the amount of food gathered by the web is proportional to the area, A, of the web. Because A=\u00bcd2=4, the amount of food gather is proportional to d2. We also assume that the energy required to build and maintain a web of area Ais proportional to d3. (The basic assumption is that the work to build a square centimeter of web increases as the total web area increases because of the need to have stronger \u00afbers. If, for example, the area of the \u00afber cross-section increases linearly with Aand the mesh of the web is constant, the mass of the web increases as d3.) With these assumptions, the net energy, E, available to the spider is of the form E= Energy from insects caught \u00a1Energy expended building the web =k1d2\u00a1k2d3 where dis measured in centimeters and k1andk2are proportionality constants. For illustration we will assume that k1= 0:01 and k2= 0:0001. A graph of E(d) = 0 :01d2\u00a10:0001d3 is shown in Figure 3.19 where it can be seen that there are two points, AandB, at which the graph has horizontal tangents. We \u00afnd where the derivative is zero to locate AandB.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 157 0 20 40 60 80 10002468101214161820 A B Diameter of spider web, d, in cm.Net energy from web of diameter d Figure 3.19: Graph of E(d) = 0 :01d2\u00a10:0001d3representative of the energy gain from a spider web of diameter dcm.

At d= 66:7 cm, E(d) = 14 :8 (units unspeci\u00afed) suggests that a positive net energy will accrue with a web of diameter 66.7 cm and that weaving a web of 66.7cm diameter is the optimum strategy for the spider. Note that if our model and its parameters are correct we have determined in a rather short time what it took spiders many generations to work out. At the very least we could have moved the spiders ahead several generations with our model.

Exercise 3.5.12 Show that the derivatives of cubic functions are quadratic functions. Exercise 3.5.13 Probably baseball statistics should be discussed in British units rather than metric units. Professional pitchers throw fast balls in the range of 90+ miles per hour.

Exercise 3.5.14 A squirrel falls from a tree from a height of 10 meters above the ground. At time t seconds after it slips from the tree, the squirrel is a distance s(t) = 10 \u00a14:9t2meters above the ground. How fast is the squirrel falling when it hits the ground? Exercise 3.5.15 What is the optimum radius of the trachea when coughing? The objective is for the \u00b0ow of air to create a strong force outward in the throat to clear it. For this problem you should perform the following experiment. Hold your hand about 10 cm from your mouth and blow on it (a) with your lips compressed almost closed but with a small stream of air escaping, (b) with your mouth wide open, and (c) with your lips adjusted to create the largest force on your hand. With (a) your lips almost closed there is a high pressure causing rapid air \u00b0ow but a small stream of air and little force. With (b) your mouth wide open there is a large stream of air but with little pressure so that air \u00b0ow is slow. The largest force (c) is created with an intermediate opening of your lips where there is a notable pressure and rapid \u00b0ow of substantial volume of air. LetRbe the normal radius of the trachea and r < R be the tracheal radius when coughing. Assume that the velocity of air \u00b0ow through the trachea is proportional to pressure di\u00aeerence across the trachea and that the pressure di\u00aeerence is proportional to R\u00a1r, the constriction of the trachea. Assume that the mass of air \u00b0ow is proportional to the area of the trachea ( \u00bcr2).

Exercise 3.5.21 Consider a territorial bird that harvests only in its defended territory (assumed to be circular in shape). The amount of food available can be assumed to be proportional to the area of the territory and therefore proportional to d2, the square of the diameter of the territory. Assume that the food gathered is proportional to the amount of food available times the time spent gathering food. Let the unit of time be one day, and suppose the amount of time spent defending the territory is proportional to the length of the territory boundary and therefore equal to k\u00a3dfor some constant, k. Then 1 \u00a1k dis the amount of time available to gather food, and the amount, Fof food gathered will be F=k2\u00a3d2\u00a3(1\u00a1k d) Find the value of dthat will maximize the amount of food gathered. 3.6 The second derivative and higher order derivatives. You may read or hear statements such as \\the rate of population growth is decreasing\", or \\the rate of in\u00b0ation is increasing\", or the velocity of the particle is increasing.\" In each case the underlying quantity is a rate and itsrate of change is important. De\u00afnition 3.6.1 The second derivative. The second derivative of a function, P, is the derivative of the derivative of P, or the derivative of P0. The second derivative of \u00afrst and second derivatives. That a function, Pisincreasing on an interval [a; b] means that ifsandtare in [ a; b] and s < t then P(s)< P(t) It should be fairly intuitive that if the \u00afrst derivative of a function, P, is positive throughout [ a; b], then Pis increasing on [ a; b]. Both graphs in Figure 3.20 have positive \u00afrst derivatives and are increasing. The graphs also illustrate the geometry of the second derivative. In Figure 3.20A P0is increasing (P0(s)< P0(t)).Phas a positive second derivative (P00>0) and the graph of Pisconcave upward . In Figure 3.20B, P0is decreasing ( P0(s)> P0(t)).Phas a negative second derivative (P00<0) and the graph of Pis concave downward. We will expand on this interpretation in Chapters 8 and 9.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 162 A sP(s) = 0.5P(t) = 1.0P > 0 t < B sP(s) = 1.0P(t) = 0.5P < 0 t < Figure 3.20: A. Graph of a function with a positive second derivative; it is concave up. B. Graph of a function with a negative second derivative; it is concave down. The higher order derivatives are a natural extension of the transition from the derivative to the second derivative. The third derivative is the derivative of the second derivative; the fourth derivative is the derivative of the third derivative; and the process continues. In this language, the derivative of Pis called the \u00afrst derivative of P(and sometimes Pitself is called the zero-order derivative of P). De\u00afnition 3.6.2 Inductive de\u00afnition of higher order derivatives. The derivative of a function, P, is the order 1 derivative of P. For nan integer greater than 1, the order nderivative of Pis the derivative of the order n\u00a11derivative of P. The third order derivative of is a constant function, and P00(t) = [\u00b9]0= 0 is the zero function. A similar pattern occurs with quadratic polynomials. Suppose P(t) =at2+bt+cis aCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 163 quadratic polynomial. Then P0(t) = [ at2+bt+c]0 = 2at+b P0(t) is a linear function. P00(t) = [ 2 at+b]0 = 2a P00(t) is a constant function. P000(t) = [ 2 a]0 = 0 P000(t) is the zero function.(3.33) Explore 3.6.1 Suppose P(t) =a+bt+ct2+dt3is a cubic polynomial. Show that P0is a quadratic polynomial, P00is a linear function, P000is a constant function, and P(4)is the zero function. IfS(t) is the position of a particle along an axis at time t, then s0(t) is the velocity of the particle and the rate of change of velocity, s00(t), is called the acceleration of the particle. Sometimes when s00(t) is negative the word deceleration is used to describe the motion of the particle. The word acceleration is used to describe second derivatives in other contexts. An accelerating economy is one in which the rate of increase of the gross national product is increasing. Example 3.6.1 Shown in Figure 3.21A is the graph of the logistic function, L(t), \u00afrst shown in Figure 3.12. Some tangents are drawn on the graph of L. The slope at bis greater than the slope at a; the slope, L0(t), is increasing on the interval to the left of the point marked, I=In\u00b0ection Point.

The tangent at the in\u00b0ection point is shown in Figure 3.21B, and it is interesting that the tangent crosses the curve at I. The slope of that tangent:= 1:733, the largest of the slopes of all of the tangents. The maximum population growth rate occurs at tIand is approximately 1733 individuals per year. Explore 3.6.3 Danger: Obnubilation Zone. You have to think about this. Suppose the population represented by the logistic curve in Figure 3.21 is a natural population such as deer, \u00afsh, geese or shrimp, and suppose you are responsible for setting the size of harvest each year. What is your strategy? Argue with a friend about this. You should observe that the population size at the in\u00b0ection point, I, is 5 which is one-half the maximum supportable population of 10. You should discuss the fact that variable weather, disease and other factors may disrupt the ideal of logistic growth. You should discuss how much harvest you could have if you maintained the population at points a,b,cordin Figure 3.21A. 3.6.1 Falling objects. We describe the position, s(t), of an object falling in the earth's gravity \u00afeld near the Earth's surface t seconds after release. We assume that the velocity of the object at time of release is v0and the height of the object above the earth (or some reference point) at time of release is s0. Gravity near the Earth's surface is constant, equal to g= -980 cm/sec2. We write the Mathematical Model 3.6.1 Free falling object. The acceleration of a free falling object near the Earth's surface is the acceleration of gravity, g. Because s00(t) is the acceleration of the falling object, we write s00(t) =g: Now, s00is a constant and is the derivative of s0. The derivative of a linear function, P(t) =at+b, is a constant ( P0(t) =a). We invoke some advertising logic8and guess that s0(t) is a linear function (proved in Chapter 14). s0(t) =g t+bBolt out of Chapter 14. 8A tall, muscular, rugged man drives a Dodge Ram. If you buy a Dodge Ram, you will be a tall muscular, rugged man.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 165 Because s0(0) = v0is assumed known, and s0(0) = g0 +b=b, we write s0(t) =g t+s0 Using equally compelling logic, because the derivative of a quadratic function, P(t) =a t2+b t+c, is a linear 2 a t+b), and because write s(t) (3.34) . Example 3.6.2 Students measured height vstime of a falling bean bag using a Texas Instruments Calculator Based Laboratory Motion Detector, and the data are shown in Figure 3.22A. Average velocities were computed between data points and plotted against the midpoints of the data intervals in Figure 3.22B. Mid-time is (Time i+1+ Time i)/2 and Ave. Vel. is (Height i+1- Height i)/(Time i+1- Time i).

An equation of the line \u00aft by least squares to the graph of Average Velocity vsMidpoint of time interval is vave=\u00a1849tmid+ 126 cm/s : If we assume a continuous model based on this data, we have s0(t) =\u00a1849t+ 126 ; s (t) =\u00a1849 2t2+ 126 t+s0cm From Figure 3.22, the height of the \u00afrst point is about 240. We write s(t) =\u00a1849 2t2+ 126 t+ 240 cm The graph of salong with the original data is shown in Figure 3.22C. The match is good. Instead of g -980 cm/s2that applies to objects falling in a vacuum we have acceleration of the bean bag in air to be \u00a1849cm/sec2.

The derivative and its companion, the integral that is studied in Chapter 13, enabled9an explosion in science and mathematics beginning in the late seventeenth century, and remain at the core of science and mathematics today. Brie\u00b0y, for a suitable function, P, the derivative of Pis the function P0de\u00afned by P0(t) = lim h!0P(t+h)\u00a1P(t) h(3.38) We also wrote P0(t) as [ P(t) ]0. A helpful interpretation of P0(a) is that it is the slope of the tangent to the graph of Pat the point ( a; P(a)). The derivatives of three functions were computed (for Ca number and na positive integer) and we wrote what we call primary formulas: P(t) = C=)P0(t) = 0 or [ C]0= 0 P(t) = t=)P0(t) = 1 or ntn\u00a11or [tn]0=ntn\u00a119 >>>>>>= >>>>>>;(3.39) 9It might also be argued that the explosion in science enabled or caused the creation of the derivative and integral. The two are inseparable.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 174 Two combination formulas were developed: P(t) = expand both the list of primary formulas and the list of combination formulas in future chapters and thus expand the array of derivatives that you can compute without explicit reference to the De\u00afnition of Derivative Equation 3.38. We saw that derivatives describe rates of chemical reactions, and used the derivative function to \u00afnd optimum values of spider web design and the height of a pop \u00b0y in baseball. We examined two cases of dynamic systems, mold growth and falling objects, using rates of change rather than the average rates of change used in Chapter 1. A vast array of dynamical systems and optimization problems have been solved since the introduction of calculus. We will see some of them in future chapters. Finally we de\u00afned and computed the second derivative and higher order derivatives and gave some geometric interpretations (concave up and concave down) and some physical interpretation (acceleration). Exercises for Chapter 3, The Derivative.

Draw the graph Pand the tangent. a: P(t) = 4 Continuity and the Power Chain Rule 4.1 Continuity. We require the concept of continuity of a function. Most, but not all, of the functions in previous sections and that you will encounter in biology are continuous. Four equivalent de\u00afnitions of continuity follow, with di\u00aeering levels of intuition and formality. De\u00afnition 4.1.1 Continuity of a function at a number in its domain. Intuitive: A function, f, is continuous at a number ain its domain means that if xis in the domain of fandxis close to a, then f(x)is close to f(a). Symbolic: A function, f, is continuous at a number ain its domain means that either limx!af(x) =f(a) or there is an open interval containing aand no other point of the domain of f. Formal: A function, f, is continuous at a number ain its domain means that for every positive number, \u00b2, there is a positive number \u00b1such that if xis in the domain of fandjx\u00a1aj< \u00b1then jf(x)\u00a1f(a)j< \u00b2. Geometrical A simple graph Gis continuous at a point PofGmeans that if \u00aeand\u00afare horizontal lines with Pbetween them there are vertical lines handkwithPbetween them such that every point of of \u00aeand\u00af. De\u00afnition 4.1.2 Discontinuous. Ifais a the domain of a function fat which fis not continuous then fis said to be discontinuous at a. De\u00afnition 4.1.3 Continuous function. A function, f, is continuous means that fis continuous at every number, a, in its domain. Almost all of the functions that you have experienced are continuous, and to many students it is intuitive obvious from the notation that u(b) approaches u(a) asbapproaches a; but in some cases u(b) does not approach u(a) asbapproaches a. Some examples demonstrating the exception follow. 176Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 177 Example 4.1.1 1.You showed in Exercise 3.2.7 that every polynomial is continuous. 2.The function describing serum insulin concentration as a function of time is a continuous function even though it may change quickly with serious consequences. 3.The word 'threshold' suggests a discontinuous change in one parameter as a related parameter crosses the threshold. Stimulus to neurons causes ion gates to open. When an Na+ion gate is opened, Na+\u00b0ows into the cell gradually increasing the membrane potential, called a `graded response' (continuous response), up to a certain threshold at which an action potential is triggered (a rapid increase in membrane potential) that appears to be a discontinuous response. As in almost all biological examples, however, the function is actually continuous. See Example Figure 4.1.1.1A. 4.Surprise. The graph in Figure 4.1.1.1B is continuous. There are only three points of the graph. The graph is continuous at, for example, the point (3,2). There is an open interval containing 3, (2:5;3:5), for example, that contains 3 and no other point of the domain. Figure for Example 4.1.1.1 A. Events leading to a nerve action potential. B. A discrete graph is continuous.

The function is discontinuous at t= 28. If the temperature, T, is close to 28 and less than 28, then % Female( T) is 0, which in usual measures is not `close to' 50 = % Female(28). 6.As you move up a mountain side, the \u00b0ora is usually described as being a discontinuous function of altitude. There is a `tree line', below which the dominant plant species are pine and spruce and above which the dominant plant species are low growing brushes and grasses, as illustrated in Figure 4.1.1.1C1Such a region of apparent discontinuity is termed an `ecotone' by ecologists. Figure for Example 4.1.1.1 (Continued.) C. A tree line. 1Ke4roh picture of Berthoud pass, Colorado http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree lineCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 178 C 7.The ecotone illustrated by the tree line in Figure 4.1.1.1C appears sharp. Sharpness, however, may just be a matter of scale: if you walk through the tree line, you will a gradual decrease in tree density and pockets of trees above the tree line. It is important to the concept of discontinuity that there be an abrupt change in the dependent variable with only a gradual change in the independent variable. Charles Darwin expressed it: Charles Darwin, Origin of Species. Chap. VI, Di\u00b1culties of the Theory. \\We see the same fact in ascending mountains, and sometimes it is quite remarkable how abruptly, as Alph. de Candolle has observed, a common alpine species disappears. The same fact has been noticed by E. Forbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge. To those who look at climate and the physical conditions of life as the all-important elements of distribution, these facts ought to cause surprise, as climate and height or depth graduate away insensibly [our emphasis].\" 8.From Equation 3.10, limx!a1 x=1 a, f(x) =1 xis continuous. The graph of f(x) certainly changes rapidly near x= 0, and one may think that fis not continuous at x= 0. However, 0 is not in the domain of f, so that the function is neither continuous nor discontinuous at x= 0. =1 xforx6= 0; g (0) = 2 A graph of gis shown in Example Figure 4.1.1.1E. The function gis not continuous at 0 and the graph of gis not continuous at (0 ;2). Two horizontal lines above and below (0 ;2) are drawn in Figure 4.1.1.1F. For every pair of vertical lines handkwith (0 ;2) between them there are points of the graph of gbetween handkthat are not between \u00aeand\u00af. Figure for Example 4.1.1.1 (Continued) E.

Explore Figure 4.1.1 The graph of g(x) = 1 =xforx6= 0,g(0) = 2, horizontal lines above and below (0 ;2), and vertical lines (dashed) with (0,2) between them. 3 0 3303 xy (0, 2) 10.The geological age of soil is not a continuous function of depth below the surface. Older soils are at a greater depth, so that the age of soils is (almost always) an increasing function of depth. However, in many locations, soils of some ages are missing: soils of age 400 million years may rest directly on top of soils of age 1.7 billion years as shown in Figure 4.1.1.1. Either soils of the intervening ages were not deposited in that location or they were deposited and subsequently eroded. Geologist speak of an \\unconformity\" occurring at that location and depth.

Snow line \u00afgure for Exercise 4.1.4.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 180 G H 11.Every increasing function de\u00afned on an interval that is discontinuous at some point has a vertical gap in the graph at that point. Every increasing function with no gap is continuous. Figure for Example 4.1.1.1 (Continued) H. An increasing function. There are two gaps and two points of discontinuity. H 00 a by = f( t ) Combinations of continuous functions. We showed in Chapter 3 that limx!a(F1(x) +F2(x)) = lim x!aF1(x) + lim limx!aF2(x): Equation 3.17 From these results it follows that if uandvare continuous functions with common domain, D, then u+v and u\u00a3v are continuous ; (4.2) and if v(t) is not zero for any tinD, then u vis continuous. (4.3)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 181 Of particular interest is the equation on the limit of composition of two functions, If limx!au(x) =L and lim s!LF(s) =\u00b8; then limx!aF(u(x)) =\u00b8 Equation 3.16 From this it follows that if Fanduare continuous and the domain of Fcontains the range of uthen F\u00b1u; the composition of Fwith u, is continuous.

Exercise 4.1.8 The function, f(x) =3pxis continuous. 1.How close must xbe to 1 in order to insure that f(x) is within 0.1 of f(1) = 1 (that is, to insure that 0 :9< f(x)<1:1)? 2.How close must xbe to 1/8 in order to insure that f(x) is within 0.0001 of f(1=8) = 1/2 (that is, to insure that 0 :4999 < f(x)<0:5001)? 3.How close must xbe to 0 in order to insure that f(x) is within 0.1 of f(0) = 0? Exercise 4.1.9 a.Draw the graph of a function, f, de\u00afned on the interval [1 ;3] such that f(1) =\u00a12 your graph intersect the X-axis? c.Draw a graph of of a function, f, de\u00afned on the interval [1 ;3] such that f(1) =\u00a12 and f(3) = 4 that does not intersect the X-axis. Be sure that its X-projection is all of [1 ;3]. d.Write equations to de\u00afne a function, [1 ;3] such that f(1) =\u00a12 and f(3) = 4 the graph of fdoes not intersect the X-axis. e.There is a theorem that asserts that the function you just de\u00afned must be discontinuous at some number in [1,3]. Identify such a number for your example. The preceding problem illustrates a general property of continuous functions called the intermediate value property . Brie\u00b0y it says that a continuous function de\u00afned on an interval that has both positive and negative values on the interval, must also be zero somewhere on the interval. In language of graphs, the graph of a continuous function de\u00afned on an interval that has a point above the X-axis and a point below the X-axis must intersect the X-axis. The proof of this property requires more than the familiar properties of addition, multiplication, and order of the real numbers. It requires the completion property of the real numbers.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 183 Exercise 4.1.10 A nutritionist studying plasma epinephrine (EPI) kinetics with tritium labeled epinephrine, [3H]EPI, observes that after a bolus injection of [3H]EPI into plasma, the time-dependence of [3H]EPI level is well approximated by L(t) = 4 e\u00a12t+ 3e\u00a1twhere L(t) is the level of [3H]EPI t hours after infusion. Sketch the graph of L. Observe that L(0) = 7 and L(2) = 0 :479268. The intermediate value property asserts that at some time between 0 and 2 hours the level of [3H]EPI will be 1.0. At what time will L(t) = 1 :0? (Let A=e\u00a1tand observe that A2=e\u00a12t.) Exercise 4.1.11 For the function, f(x) = 10 \u00a1x2, \u00afnd an an open interval, (3 \u00a1\u00b1;3 +\u00b1) so that f(x)>0 for xin (3\u00a1\u00b1;3 +\u00b1). Exercise 4.1.12 For the function, f(x) = sin( x), \u00afnd an an open interval, (3 \u00a1\u00b1;3 +\u00b1) so that f(x)>0 for xin (3\u00a1\u00b1;3 +\u00b1). Exercise 4.1.13 The previous two problems illustrate a property of continuous functions formulated in the Locally Positive Theorem: Theorem 4.1.1 Locally Positive Theorem. If a function, f, is continuous at a number ain its domain and f(a)is positive, then there is a positive number, \u00b1, such that f(x)is positive for every number xin(a\u00a1\u00b1; a+\u00b1)and in the domain of f. Prove the Locally Positive Theorem. Your proof may begin: 1.Suppose the hypothesis of the Locally Positive Theorem. 2.Let\u00b2=f(a). 3.Use the hypothesis that lim x!af(x) =f(a). Exercise 4.1.14 Is it true that if a function, f, is positive at a number ain its domain, then there is a positive number, \u00b1, such that if xis in ( a\u00a1\u00b1; a+\u00b1) and in the domain of fthen f(x)>0? 4.2 The Derivative Requires Continuity. Suppose uis a function. If lim b!3u(b)\u00a15 b\u00a13= 4; what is lim b!3u(b) ? The answer is that lim b!3u(b) = 5 We reason that forbclose to 3 the numerator ofu(b)\u00a15 b\u00a13is close to 4 times the denominator. That is, u(b)\u00a15 is close to 4 \u00a3(b\u00a13): But 4 \u00a3(b\u00a13) is also close to zero. ThereforeCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 184 Ifbis close to 3, u(b)\u00a15 is close to zero and u(b) is close to 5. The general question we address is: Theorem 4.2.1 The Derivative Requires Continuity. Ifuis a function and u0(t) exists at t=athen uis continuous at t=a. Proof.

A a by u(t) =8 >< >:0 for 20 \u00b7t for t= 28 100 for 28 < t\u00b730(4.6) is shown in Figure 4.1A. We observed in Section 4.1 that uis not continuous at t= 28.

In Section 3.5 we proved the Power Rule: for all positive integers, n, [tn]0(t) =ntn\u00a11Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 187 We show here the generalized power rule . Suppose nis a positive integer and u(t) is a function that has a derivative for all t. We use the notation (u(t))n=un(t): Then [ un(t) ]0=n un\u00a11(t)\u00a3u0(t):(4.7) The generalized power rule is used in the following setting. Suppose P(t) =\u00b3 1 +t2\u00b43 There are two options for computing P0(t). Option A. Expand the binomial: P(t) =\u00b3 1 +t2\u00b43 = 1 + 3 t2+ 3t4+t6 Then use the Sum, Constant, Constant Factor, and Power Rules to show that P0(t) = 0 + 6 t+ 12t3+ 6t5 Option B. Use the Generalized Power Rule with u(t) = 1 + t2. Then P(t) = ( 1 +t2]0= 3u2(t)\u00a3u0(t) = 3 ( 1 + t2)2\u00a32t The answers are the same, for 3\u00b3 1 1 + 2 6t5 Option A (expand the binomial) may appear easier than Option B (use the generalized power rule), but the generalized power rule is clearly easier for a problem like Compute P0(t) for P(t) =\u00b3 1 +t2\u00b410 Expanding ( 1 + t2)10into polynomial form is tedious (if you try it you may conclude that it is a more than tedious).

Use parentheses, ( )0s, they are cheap. 4.3.1 The Power Chain Rule. The Generalized Power Rule is one of a collection of rules called chain rules and henceforth we will refer to it as the Power Chain Rule. The reason for the word, `chain' is that the rule is often a `link' in a `chain' of steps leading to a derivative. Because of its form [u(t)n]0=nu(t)n\u00a11\u00a3[u(t) ]0; when the Power Chain Rule is used, there always remains a derivative, [ u(t) ]0, to compute after the Power Chain Rule is used. The power chain rule is never the \u00afnal step { the \u00afnal step is always one or more of the Primary Formulas. For example, compute the derivative of y=1 1 +p x+ 1=\u00b3 1 + (x+ 1)1=2\u00b4\u00a11Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 192 y0=\u00b7\u00b3 1 + (x+ 1)1=2\u00b4\u00a11\u00b80 Logical Identity = (\u00a11)\u00b3 1 + (x+ 1)1=2\u00b4\u00a12\u00a3h 1 + (x+ 1)1=2i0Power Chain Rule = (\u00a11)\u00b3 1 + (x+ 1)1=2\u00b4\u00a12\u00b5 0 +h (x+ 1)1=2i0\u00b6 Sum and Constant Rules = (\u00a11)\u00b3 1 + (x+ 1)1=2\u00b4\u00a12(1=2)(x+ 1)\u00a11=2[x+ 1]0Power Chain Rule = (\u00a11)\u00b3 1 + (x+ 1)1=2\u00b4\u00a12(1=2)(x+ 1)\u00a11=2(1 + 0) Power and Constant Rules Exercises for Section 4.3, The generalized power rule.

The Power Chain Rule PCR: [ un(t) ]0=n un\u00a11(t)\u00a3u0(t) (4.11) greatly expands the diversity and interest of problems that we can analyze. Some introductory examples follow. Example 4.4.1 A. Find the slope of the tangent to the circle, x2+y2= 13, at the point (2,3). See Figure 4.3. B. Also \u00afnd the slope of the tangent to the circle, x2+y2= x2+y2= 13 and tangents drawn at the points (2,3) and (3,-2) of the circle. Solution First check that 22+ 32= 4 + 9 = 13, so that (2,3) is indeed a point of the circle. Then solve for yinx2+y2= 13 to get y1=p 13\u00a1x2Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 195 Then the Power Chain Rule with n=1 2yields d.

Observe that 22+ (\u00a13)2= 4 + 9 = 13 so that (2,-3) is a point of x2+y2= 13, but (2,-3) does not satisfy y1=\u00b3 13\u00a1x2\u00b41 2Cornette Ackerman, August 2010 196 because \u00a136=\u00b3 13\u00a122\u00b41 2= 3 For (2,-3) we must and the slope of the line drawn is 3/2. It is often helpful to put the denominator of a fraction into the numerator with a negative exponent. For example: Problem.

In Section 3.5.2 we found that local maxima and minima are often points at which the derivative is zero. The algebraic functions for which we can now compute derivatives have only a \u00afnite number of points at which the derivative is zero or does not exist and it is usually a simple matter to search among them for the highest or lowest points of their graphs. Such a process has long been used to \u00afnd optimum parameter values and a few of the traditional problems that can be solved using the derivative rules of this chapter are included here. More optimization problems appear in Chapter 8 Applications of the Derivative. Assume for this section only that all local maxima and local minima of a function, F, are found by computing F0and solving for xinF0(x) = 0. Example 4.5.1 A forester needs to get from point Aon a road to point Bin a forest (see diagram in Figure 4.4). She can travel 5 km/hr on the road and 3 km/hr in the forest. At what point, P, should she leave the road and enter the forest in order to minimize the time required to travel from AtoB? 6 km RoadA P C B5 km Forestx Figure 4.4: Diagram of a forest and ad- jacent road for Example 4.5.1 Solution. She might go directly from AtoBthrough the forest; she might travel from AtoCand then to B; or she might, as illustrated by the dashed line, travel from Ato a point, P, along the road and then from PtoB. Assume that the road is straight, the distance from Bto the road is 5 km and the distance from A to the projection of Bonto the road (point Q) is 6 km. The point, P, is where the forester leaves the road; let xbe the distance from AtoP. The basic relation between distance, speed, and time is that Distance (km) = Speed (km/hr) \u00a3Time (hr) so that Time =Distance SpeedCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 200 The distance traveled and time required are Along the road In the forest Distance xq (6\u00a1x)2+ 52 Timex 5q (6\u00a1x)2+ 52 3 The total trip time, T, is written as T=x 5+q (6\u00a1x)2+ 52 3(4.12) A graph of Tvsxis shown in Figure 4.5.

Your conclusion should be that the forester should travel 2.25 km from AtoPand that the time for the trip, T(2:25) = 2 :533 hours. Exercises for Section 4.5, Some optimization problems. Exercise 4.5.1 In Example 4.5.1, what should be the path of the forester is she can travel 10km/hr on the road and 4km/hr in the forest? Exercise 4.5.2 The air temperature is -10\u00b1F and Linda has a ten mile bicycle ride from the university to her home. There is no wind blowing, but riding her bicycle increases the e\u00aeects of the cold, according to the wind chill chart in Figure 4.5.2 provided by the Centers for Disease Control. The formula for computing windchill is Windchill (F) = 35.74 + 0.6215T - 35.75V0:16+ 0.4275TV0:16, where: T = Air Temperature (F) and V = Wind Speed (mph).

Exercise 4.5.3 If x pounds per acre of nitrogen fertilizer are spread on a corn \u00afeld, the yield is 200\u00a14000 x+ 25 bushels per acre. Corn is worth $4.50 per bushel and nitrogen costs $0.50 per pound. All other costs of growing and harvesting the crop amount to $600 per acre, and are independent of the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied. How much nitrogen per acre should be used to maximize the net dollar return per acre? Exercise 4.5.4 Optimum cross section of your femur. R. M. Alexander2has an interesting analysis of the cross section of mammal femurs. Femurs are hollow tubes \u00aflled with marrow. They should resist forces that tend to bend them, but not be so massive as to impair movement. An optimum femur will be the lightest bone that is strong enough to resist the maximum bending moment, M, that will be applied to it during the life of the animal. A hollow tube of mass mkg/m is may be stronger than a solid rod of the same weight, depending on two parameters of the tube, the outside radius, R, and the inside radius, x\u00a3R(0\u00b7x <1), see Figure 4.6.

There is a procedure for \u00afnding these slopes that requires less algebra, but more mathematical sophistication. In each of the 13 x2 18+y2 8= 1 2x2 35+3y2 35= 1 we might solve for yin terms of x, being careful to choose the correct square root to match the point of tangency, and then compute y0(x). Inx2+y2= 13, we may =p 13\u00a1x2. y(x) =p 13\u00a1x2is a function that `satis\u00afes' and is said to be implicitly de\u00afned by the equation.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 205 De\u00afnition 4.6.1 Implicit Function. Suppose we are given an equa- tion E(x; y) = 0 and point (a; b)for which E(a; b) = 0 A function, f, on an interval (a\u00a1h; a+h)surrounding aand satisfying E(x; f(x)) = 0 and f(a) =b is said to be implicitly de\u00afned byE. There may be no such function, f, one such function, or many such functions. Now we assume without solving for y(x) that there is a function y(x) for which x2+ (y(x) )2= 13 and y(2) = 3 and use the power rule and power chain rule to di\u00aeerentiate the terms in the equation, as follows. used for h x2i0= 2xThepower chain rule is used for h (y(x) )2i0= 2y(x)y0(x) We use x= 2 and y(2) = 3 in the last equation to get 2\u00a32 + 2\u00a33\u00a3y0(2) = 0 and solve for y0(2) to get y0(2) =\u00a12 3 as was found in Example 4.4.1 to be the slope of the tangent to x2+y2= 13 at (2,3). It is important to remember in the above steps the [ ]0means derivative with respect to the independent variable, x. The Leibnitz notation,d dx, explicitly shows this and may be easier to use. We repeat this problem with Leibnitz notation.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 for d dx\u00b3 x2\u00b4 = 2xThepower chain rule is used for d dx(y(x) )2= 2y(x)d dxy(x) Example 4.6.1 We consider another example of implicit di\u00aeerentiation. Find the slope of the graph of px+q 5\u00a1y2= 5 at (9,1) and at (4,2) First we check to see that (9,1) satis\u00afes the equation: p 9 +p 5\u00a112=p 9 +p 4 = 3 + 2 = 5 : It checks. Then we assume there is a function y(x) such that px+q 5\u00a1(y(x))2= 5 and that y(9) = 1 : We convert the square root symbols to fractional exponents and di\u00aeerentiate using 2+1 2(5\u00a1y2)\u00a11 2d dx(5\u00a1(y(x))2) = 0 2x\u00a11 2+1 2(5\u00a1y2)\u00a11 2\u00b3 d 2(5\u00a1y2)\u00a11 2\u00b3 0\u00a12yd dxy(x)\u00b4 = 0 Constant and Power Chain Rules Next we solve ford dxy(x) and get d and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 207 So the slope of the graph at (9,1) is 1/3. You may notice that we have selectively used y(x) and y; often only yis used to simplify notation. An equation of the tangent to the graph ofpx+p5\u00a1y2= 5 at the point (9,1) is y\u00a11 =1 3(x\u00a19). Now for the point (4,2), the di\u00aeerentiation is exactly the same and we point (4,2) does not satisfy the original equation and is not a point of its graph. Finding the slope at that point is meaningless, so we punt. All of this solution is algebraic. The graph of the equation shown in Figure 4.7 is of considerable help. 05101520253035404550553210123 (4,2) (9,1) (36,2) Figure 4.7: Solid points (9,1) and (4,2) for Example 4.6.1.

The goal is to explain, among other things, the historical instance of John Adams overhearing the plans of his opponents in Statuary Hall just outside the U.S. congressional chamber.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 209 Ellipses have an interesting re\u00b0ective property explained by tangents to an ellipse (see Figure 4.8A). Light or sound originating at one focal point of an ellipse is re\u00b0ected by the ellipse to the other focal point. Statuary Hall is in the shape of an ellipse. John Adams opponents had a desk at one of the focal points and Adams arranged to stand at the other focal point. This property also is a factor in the acoustics of the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City, Utah and the Smith Civil War Memorial in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

An extension of this notion to the physical universe allows us to suggest that if round things come in low-mass versions (such as planets) and high-mass versions (such as stars) then there ought to be orbs at all masses in between provided a similar physical mechanism made both .Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 211 What fundamental theorem of mathematics is being referenced in the article about the astronomical objects called brown dwarfs?

In this chapter you will learn how to compute the rates of change of exponen- tial and logarithmic func- tions. We continue the use of rate of change to model biolog- ical and physical processes. The derivatives of exponen- tial and logarithm functions greatly expand the class of biological processes that we describe with equations. y = ex y = ex xy xy y = ln xy = 1/x 5.1 Derivatives of Exponential Functions. Exponential functions are often used to describe the growth or decline of biological populations, distribution of enzymes over space, and other biological and chemical relations. The rate of change of exponential functions describes population growth rate, decay of chemical concentration with space, and rates of change of other biological and chemical processes. 212Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 213 The exponential function E(t) = 2t(where the base is 2 and the exponent is t) is quite di\u00aeerent from the algebraic function, P(t) =t2(where the base is tand the exponent is 2). P(t) =t2is well de\u00afned for all numbers tin terms of multiplication, P(t) =t\u00a3t. However, in elementary courses 2tis de\u00afned only forta rational number. For the irrational 1 :4142135 \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2, for example, 2p sequence 21:4, 21:41, 21:414, 21:4142,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2approaches. We will not formalize this idea, but will assume that 2tis meaningful for all numbers t.

Within the accuracy of Table 5.1, you may conclude that m2should be between 2.77249 and 2.77268. The average of 2.77249 and 2.77268 is a good estimate of m2. m[2;1:9999]+m[2;2:0001] and 2.7726848 correct to only \u00afve digits, but their average, 2.7725887, is correct to all eight digits shown. Such improvement in accuracy by averaging left and right di\u00aeerence quotients (de\u00afned next) is common. ForPa function, the fraction, P(b)\u00a1P(a) b\u00a1a;Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 214 is called a di\u00aeerence quotient for P.Ifh >0 then the backward, and centered, and forward di\u00aeerence quotients at aare Backward Centered Forward P(a)\u00a1P(a\u00a1h) hP(a+h)\u00a1P(a\u00a1h) 2hP(a+h)\u00a1P(a) h Assuming the interval size his the same in all three, the centered di\u00aeerence quotient is the average of the backward and forward di\u00aeerence quotients. The graphs in Figure 5.1 suggest, and it is generally true, that the centered di\u00aeerence quotient is a better approximation to the slope of the tangent to Pat (a; P(a)) than is either the forward or backward di\u00aeerence quotients. Formal analysis of the errors in the two approximations appears in Example 9.7.2, Equations 9.21 and 9.22. We will use the centered di\u00aeerence quotient to approximate E0(a) throughout this chapter.

There is not a simple integer or rational number that is E0(2), the rate of change of E(t) = 2tat the time t= 2. There is however, an irrational number that is E0(2); correct to twelve digits it is 2.77258872224.

An elegant pattern emerges from the previous computations. To help you \u00afnd it the last two columns contain truncated approximations to E0(t) and the values of E(t). Spend at least two minutes looking for the pattern (or less if you \u00afnd it). The pattern we hope you see is that E0(t):=E0(0)\u00a3E(t) We will soon show that for E(t) = 2t,E0(t) =E0(0)\u00a3E(t), exactly. Meanwhile supports the Explore 5.1.3 LetE(t) = 3t.

The previous work suggests a general rule: Theorem =Btwhere B > 0, then Ackerman, August 12, 2010 216 Proof: ForE(t) =Bt,B > 0, E0(t) = lim h!0Bt+h\u00a1Bt h h!0Bt\u00a3Bh\u00a1Bt h = lim h!0Bt\u00b3 Bh\u00a11\u00b4 h =Btlim h!0Bh\u00a1B0 h =E(t)\u00a3E0(0) End of proof.

We write the di\u00aeerence quotient,F(t+h)\u00a1F(t) h, balance hin the denominator with some term in the numerator, and let h!0. In Chapters 3 and 4 we always could factor an hfrom the numerator that algebraically canceled the hin the denominator.

We write (1 +h)1 h< e bounded between 1 a number 1 =(1\u00a1h) that is approaching 1 ashapproaches zero. This insures that\u00b3 eh\u00a11\u00b4 =halso approaches 1 as happroaches zero. Because of Theorem 5.1.1, E0(t) =E0(0)\u00a3E(t) =et, we have another Primary Formula for computing derivatives: h eti0=etExponential Rule (5.5) Strategy for computing derivatives: Now we can use three Primary Formulas (Constant, Power, Exponential) and three Composition Formulas (Sum, Constant Factor, Power Chain) to compute derivatives. In \u00afnding derivatives of functions with many terms, students sometimes ask what derivative rule to use \u00afrst and in subsequent steps. We think of the derivative procedure as peeling the layers o\u00ae of an onion { outside layer \u00afrst, etc. For example, to compute the derivative of F(t) = ( 2 + 3 t2+ 5et)3weCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 221 write: F0(t) =h ( 2 + 3 t2+ 3 ( 2 + 3 t2+ 5et)2[ 2 + 3 t2+ 5et]0Power Chain Rule 2 + 3 5et)2\u00b5 [2]0+ [3t2]0+ [5et]0\u00b6 = t2+ 5et)2\u00b5 0 + [3 t2]0+ [5et]0\u00b6 Constant Rule 2 + 3 t2+ 5et)2\u00b5 3 [t2]0+ 5 [et]0\u00b6 Constant Factor Rule = 3 ( 2 + 3 t2+ 5et)2\u00b5 3 (2t) + 5 [ et]0\u00b6 Power Rule 3 ( 6t+ 5et\u00b6 Exponential Rule9 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>= >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>;(5.6) Think how the expression for Fin the previous example, F(t) = (2 + 3 t2+ 5et)3, is evaluated. Given a value for tyou would compute t2and multiply it by 3 and you would compute etand multiply it by 5, and then you would sum the three terms. The last step (outside layer) in the evaluation is to cube the sum. The \u00afrst step in computing the derivative is to `undo' that cube (use the Power Chain Rule). The next step is to undo the sum with the Sum Rule. The next step is not uniquely determined; we worked from left to right and chose to evaluate [2]0. In evaluating 3 t2and 5 et, the last step would be to multiply by 3 or 5 { the \u00afrst step in \u00afnding the derivative of 3 t2and 5 etis to factor 3 and 5 from the derivative (Constant Factor Rule), h 3t2i0= 3h t2i0 h 5eti0= 5h eti0 Finally the Primary Formulas for [ t2]0and [ et]0are used. Usual course of events. In computing derivatives, use the Composition Formulas \u00afrst and the Primary Formulas last. 5.2.1 Proof that lim h!0(1 +h)1=hexists. We prove that (1 + h)1=happroaches a number as happroaches 0 (we denoted that number by e).You may accept this fact without proof and delay or omit study of this Subsection. The argument is based onCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 222 Axiom 1 Completeness property of the number system. IfS1andS2 are two sets of numbers and 1. Every number belongs to either S1orS2, and 2. Every number of S1is less than every number of S2, then there is a number Csuch that Cis either the largest number of S1orC is the least number of S2. The statement of the Completeness Axiom by Richard Dedekind in 1872 greatly increased our understanding of the number system. In this text, the word 'set' means a nonempty set. IfAandBare numbers with A < B , the open interval ( A; B) consists of all the numbers between A andB; the closed interval [ A; B] consists of A,B, and all of the numbers between AandB. That a sequence of numbers s1; s2; s3\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2is bounded means that an contains every number ins1; s2; s3\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2;Ais called a lower bound and Bis called an upper bound of s1; s2; s3\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2. The sequence f1;4;9;16;25;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2ghas no upper bound bounded. The sequence f1;1 2;1 3;1 4;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2gis bounded by the numbers 0 and 2. The sequence f1;\u00a12;3;\u00a14;5;\u00a16;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2ghas neither a lower bound nor an upper bound and is not bounded. For this section we prove: Theorem 5.2.1 Ifs1\u00b7s2\u00b7s3\u00b7 \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2 is a a number s1; s2; s3\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2approaches s. To v)is open interval containing sthere is a positive integer Nsuch that if nis an integer greater than N,snis in (u; v). The sequence f1;1 2;1 3;1 4;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2gapproaches zero. If ( u; v) contains 0, vis greater than zero and there is1a positive integer Nsuch that Nis greater than 1 =v. Therefore, if n > N ,n >1=uso that 1 =n < u , andu <0<1=n number s1; s2; s3\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2is greater than x.Ais a member ofS1andBis not a member of S1. Let S2denote all of the numbers not in S1Clearly every number is in either S1orS2. To use the Completeness Axiom we must show that every number of S1is less than every number of S2. Suppose not; suppose there is a number xofS1that is greater than a number yofS2. Then xhas that some s1; ofs1; s2; s3\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2is greater than y. However, the supposition that y < x andx < s n, leads to y < s nwhich is a contradiction. Therefore every number of S1is less than every number of S2. 1This is called the Archimedean property of the integers and may be treated as an axiom also. It is, however, a consequence of the Completeness Axiom, Exercise 5.2.9Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 223 By the Completeness Axiom, either S1has a largest number or S2has a least number. Suppose S1 has a largest number L1. By de\u00afnition of S1there is a member snofs1; less than snsoL1+sn2is inL1. ButL1+sn2is greater than L1soL1is not the largest member of S1, which is a contradiction; S1does not have a largest number. Therefore S2must have number s3\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2approaches L2. u; v) is an open interval containing L2. Then u is less than L2so belongs to S1and there is a number, SNins1; is greater than u. Because s1; s3\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2is increasing, if nis greater than of s1; s2; s3\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2is greater than L2. Therefore if nis greater than N, u < s N\u00b7sn< L 2< v and the de\u00afnition that L2is 5.2.1 We can use Theorem 5.2.1 to show a useful result that if ais a number and 0 < a < 1, then the sequence xn=anconverges to zero. Proof. We assume the alternate version of Theorem 5.2.1 that If s1\u00b7s2\u00b7s3\u00b7 \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2 is a bounded nonincreasing a number ssuch that s1; s2; s3\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2approaches s. Because 0 < a < 1 and xn+1=a\u00a2xn,xn+1< x n, and it follows that xnis a nonincreasing (actually decreasing) sequence. Then fxngapproaches the greatest lower bound, soffxng. Ifs <0, there is a number, xminfxngthat is between sand 0. Then xm=amis negative which is a contradiction. Suppose s >0. Because 0 < a < 1), the number s=ais greater than sand there is a number, xmin fxngthat is between sands=a. Then s x m+1< s: But this contradicts the condition that sis a lower bound on fxng. Now to the number, e. We are to show that (1 + h)1=happroaches a number as happroaches 0, but only consider the values of hforh=1 nwhere nan integer greater than 2. This restriction is acceptable because (1 + h)1=hstrictly increases as hdecreases on 0 < h <1 2, a fact that we assume without proof. We will show that 1.The sequence sn=\u00b3 1 +1 n\u00b4nis +1 n >1,sn< tn. 4.Asnincreases without bound, tn\u00a1snapproaches 0. Conditions 1 and 3 show that s1< s2< s3<\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2is a bounded increasing sequence and number ssuch that s1< s2< s3<\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2approaches s. That number sis the number we denote by e. Conditions 2 and 3 show that t1> t2> t3>\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2is a bounded decreasing sequence and it follows fromCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 224 Theorem 5.2.12that there a number tsuch to tBy condition 4 above, t=s. The proofs of conditions 3 and 4 above are left as exercises. Our argument for conditions 1 and 2 is that of N. S. Mendelsohn3based on the following theorem. The theorem is of general interest and we prove it in Subsection 8.1.2, independently of the work in this section. Theorem 5.2.2 Ifa1,a2,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2,anis a sequence of npositive numbers then a1+a2+\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2an n\u00b8npa1a2\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2an (5.7) with equality only when a1=a2=\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2=an. The left side of inequality 5.7 is the arithmetic mean and the right side is the geometric mean ofa1,a2, \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2,an. The theorem states that the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Proof that\u00b3 1 +1 n\u00b4nis increasing. Consider the set +1 n; 1 +1 n\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2 1 +1 n They are not all equal and they have an arithmetic mean of 1 + 1 =(n+ 1) and a geometric mean of ( 1\u00a3(1 + 1 =n)n)1=(n+1).

Exercise 5.2.10 Argue that if S1andS2are two sets of numbers and every number is in either S1orS2 and every number in S1is less than every number in S2then it is not true that there are numbers L1and L2such that L1is the greatest number in S1andL2is the least number in S2.

The natural logarithm Thenatural logarithm function, ln, is de\u00afned for u >0 by \u00b8= lnu= logeu()u=e\u00b8(5.8) The natural logarithm is the logarithm to the base eand the properties of logarithms for all bases apply: ln(A\u00a3B) = ln( B) (5.9) ln(A=B) = ln( A)\u00a1ln(B) (5.10)Cornette and Ackerman, 12, 2010 \u00b8 (5.14) The natural logarithm is keyed on your calculator as ln or LN. Equation 5.12 shows that all logarithms may be calculated using just the natural logarithm. However, log10is also keyed on most calculators and the key may be labeled Log or LOG. Using Equation 5.13 we can express all exponential functions in terms of the base e. To see this, suppose B > 0 and E(t) =Bt. Equation 5.13 states that 2\u00b4t=etln 2:=e0:631472 As a consequence, functions of the form E(t) =ekt,ka constant, are very important and we compute their derivative in the next section.

At what time will the concentration reach a maximum level, and what is the maximum concentration achieved? As we saw in Section 3.5.2 and may be apparent from the graph in Figure Ex. 5.4.9, the highest concentration is associated with the point of the graph of Cat which C0= 0.

IfPis a function de\u00afned by P(t) =Cekt implication is also true, and is shown to be true in Section 16.7:Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 235 Property 5.5.2 Exponential Growth or Decay IfPis a function and there is a number kfor which P0(t) =k\u00a3P(t) for all P(t) =Cekt In the preceding equations, kcan be either positive or negative. When kis negative, it is more common to emphasize this and write \u00a1kand write P(t) =e\u00a1kt, where in this context it is understood thatkis a positive number. In Chapter 1, we examined models of population growth, light decay, and penicillin clearance, all of which were of the form Pt+1\u00a1Pt=R\u00a3Pt and found that Pt=P0\u00a3Rt These are discrete time models in which the average rate of change ofPtis proportional to Pt. The exponential Growth or Decay Property 5.5.2 is simply a continuous time model in which the rate of change ofP(t) is proportional to P(t), and would be preferred in many instances. Bacterial populations may be visualized as growing continuously (and not in twenty minute bursts), the kidneys clear penicillin continuously (and not in \u00afve minute increments), and light decays continuously with depth (and not in one meter increments). Discrete time models are easy to comprehend and with short data intervals give good replications of data, but now that we know the de\u00afnition of rate of change we can use continuous time or space models. The equation P0=kP or P0(t) =kP(t) ordP dt=kP derives from many models of biological and physical processes including population growth, drug clearance, chemical reaction, decay of radio activity { any system which can be described by: Mathematical Model 5.5.1 Proportional change. The rate of change of a quantity is proportional to the amount of the quantity. For example in population studies, we commonly assume that Mathematical Model 5.5.2 Simple population growth. The growth rate of a population is proportional to the size of the population.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 236 LetP(t) be the size of a population at time, t. The component parts of the sentence in the Mathematical Model of simple population growth are symbolized by a: The growth rate of a population : P0(t) b: is proportional to : = k\u00a3 c: the size of the population : P(t) The sentence of the Mathematical Model is then written P0(t)|{z} a=k\u00a3|{z} bP(t)|{z} c From the property of Exponential Growth and Decay P(t) =C\u00a3ektand if P(0) = P0is known P(t) =P0ekt(5.21) In the event that the rate of decrease of a quantity, P(t), is proportional to the size of P(t), then because \u00a1P0(t) is the rate of decrease of P(t), \u00a1P0=k\u00a3P(t); P0=\u00a1k\u00a3P(t); and P(t) =P0e\u00a1kt; where kis a positive number. Example 5.5.1 A distinction between discrete and continuous models. Suppose in year 2000 a population is at 5 million people and the population growth rate (excess of births over deaths) is 6 percent per year. One interpretation of this is to let P(t) be the population size in millions of people at time tmeasured in years after 2000 and to write P(0) = 5 P0(t) = 0 :06\u00a3P(t) Then, from the property of Exponential Growth or Decay 5.5.2, we may write P(t) =P(0)e0:06t= 5e0:06t P(t) = 5 e0:06tdoes not exactly match the hypothesis that `population growth rate is 6 percent per year', however. By this equation, after one year, P(1) = 5 e0:06\u00a31= 5e0:06:= 5\u00a31:0618 The consequence is that during the \u00afrst year (and every year) there would be a 6.18 percent increase, a contradiction. The discrepancy lies with the model equation P0(t) = 0 :6P(t). Instead, we may write P(0) = 5 P0(t) =k\u00a3P(t) where kis to be determined. Then from Exponential Growth or Decay 5.5.2 we may write P(t) = 5 ektCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 237 Now impose that P(1) = 5 \u00a31:06, a 6 percent increase during the \u00afrst year, and write P(1) = 5 ek\u00a31= 5\u00a31:06 This leads to ek\u00a31= 1:06 We take the natural logarithm of both numbers and get ln\u00b3 ek\u00b4 = ln 1 :06 k= 0:05827 Then P(t) = 5 e0:05827 t gives a description of the population tyears after 2000. Each annual population is 6 percent greater than that of the preceding year. The continuous model of growth is actually P(0) = 5 P0(t) = 0 :05827 P(t) The growth of a bank savings account is similar to this simpli\u00afed model of population growth. If you deposited $5000 in 2000 at a true 6 percent annual interest rate, it may amount to P(t) = 5000 e0:05827 t dollars tyears after 2000. On the other hand, some banks advertise and compute interest on the basis of 6% interest with 'instantaneous' compounding, meaning that their model is P0(t) = 0 :06\u00a3P(t) leading to P(t) = 5000 e0:06t They will say that their `APR' (annual percentage rate) is 100 \u00a3e0:06= 6:18 percent. Example 5.5.2 Geologists in the early nineteenth century worked out the sequential order of geological layers well before they knew the absolute dates of the layers. Their most extreme estimates of the age of the earth was in the order of 400 million years4, about 1/10 of today's estimates based on decay of radioactive material. Early applications of radiometric dating used the decomposition of uranium-238 \u00afrst to thorium-234 and subsequently to lead-206. More recently Potassium-40 decomposition has been found to be useful (and zircon decay is currently the best available). 4Charles Darwin wrote in the Origin of Species that Earth was several hundred million years old, but he was opposed in 1863 by a dominant physical scientist, William Thompson (later to become Lord Kelvin) who estimated that Earth was between 24 and 400 million years old. His estimate was based on his calculation of the time it would take for Earth to cool from molten rock to today's temperatures in the upper layers of the Earth. See article by Philip England, Peter Molnar, and Frank Richter, GSA Today, 17, 1(January 1, 2007).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 238 Potassium-40 decomposes to both argon-40 and calcium-40 according to 9 (40K)\u00a1!40Ar + 8 (40Ca) When deposited, volcanic rock contains signi\u00afcant amounts of40K but is essentially free of40Ar because 40Ar is a gas that escapes the rock under volcanic conditions. Once cooled, some volcanic rock will become essentially sealed capsules that contain40K and retain the40Ar that derives from decomposition of the40K. Mathematical Model 5.5.3 Potassium-40 decomposition. The rate of disintegration of40K is proportional to the amount of40K present. If we let K(t) be the amount of40K present tyears after deposition of rock of volcanic origin and K0the initial amount of40K present, then K(0) = K0; K0(t) =\u00a1rK(t) where ris a positive constant. The minus sign re\u00b0ects the disintegration of40K. From the equation we may write K(t) =K0e\u00a1rt The half-life of40K is 1 :28\u00a3109years, meaning that 1 :28\u00a3109years after deposition of the volcanic rock, the amount of40K in the rock will be1 2K0. We use this information to evaluate r. 2=e\u00a1r\u00a31280000000 2 1280000000t Problem. Suppose a rock sample is found to have 5 \u00a31014 40K atoms and 2 \u00a31013 40Ar atoms. What is the age of the rock? Solution. It is necessary to assume5that all of the40Ar derives from the40K, and that there has been no leakage of40K or40Ar into or out of the rock. Assuming so, then the number of40K atoms that have decomposed (to either40Ca or40Ar) must be nine times the number 2 1280000000t 5Because40Ar is a gas at the temperatures that the rock was formed, no40Ar is originally in the rock.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 239 We want the value of tfor which K(t) = 5\u00a31014. about 568 million years old. 5.5.1 Two primitive modeling concepts. Primitive Concept 1. Suppose you have a barrel (which could just as well be a blood cell, stomach, liver, or lake or ocean or auditorium) and A(t) liters is the amount of water (glucose, plasma, people) in the barrel at time tminutes. If water is running into the barrel at a rate R1liters/minute and leaking out of the barrel at a rate R2liters/minute then Rate of change of water = Rate water enters \u00a1 Rate water leaves in the barrel the barrel the barrel A0(t) = R1 \u00a1 R2 L minL minL min Primitive Concept 2. Similar to Primitive Concept 1 except that there is salt in the water. Suppose S(t) is the amount in grams of salt in the barrel and C1is the concentration in grams/liter of salt in the stream entering the barrel and C2is the concentration of salt in grams/liter in the stream leaving the barrel. Then Rate of change of salt = Rate salt enters \u00a1 Rate salt leaves in the barrel the barrel the barrel S0(t) = C1\u00a3R1 \u00a1 C2\u00a3R2 g ming L\u00a3L ming L\u00a3L min Observe that the units are g/m on both sides of the equation. Maintaining a balance in units often helps to \u00afnd the correct equation. Example 5.5.3 Suppose a runner is exhaling at the rate of 2 liters per second. Then the amount of air in her lungs is decreasing at the rate of two liters per second. If, furthermore, the CO 2partial pressure inCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 240 the exhaled air is 50 mm Hg (approx 0.114 g CO 2/liter of air at body temperature of 310 K)6, then she is exhaling CO 2at Example 5.5.4 Classical Washout Curve. A barrel contains 100 liters of water and 300 grams of salt. You start a stream of pure water \u00b0owing into the barrel at 5 liters per minute, and a compensating stream of salt water \u00b0ows from the barrel at 5 liters per minute. The solution in the barrel is `well stirred' so that the salt concentration is uniform throughout the barrel at all times. Let S(t) be the amount of salt (grams) in the barrel tminutes after you start the \u00b0ow of pure water into the barrel. Explore 5.5.1 Draw a graph of what you think will be the graph of S(t). In doing so consider \u00b2What is S(0)? \u00b2Does S(t) increase or decrease? \u00b2Will a time, t\u00a4, for which S(t\u00a4) = 0? If so, what is t\u00a4? Solution. First let us analyze S. We use Primitive Concept 2. The concentration of salt in the water \u00b0owing into the barrel is 0. The concentration of salt in the water \u00b0owing out of the barrel is the same as the concentration C(t) of salt in the barrel which is C(t) =S(t) 100g/L Therefore Rate of change of salt = Rate salt enters \u00a1 Rate salt leaves in the barrel the barrel the barrel S0(t) = 300. Thus S(0) = 300 S0(t) = \u00a10:05S(t): From the Exponential Growth and Decay property 5.5.2, S(t) = 300 e\u00a10:05t 6 50 760A\u00a31liter\u00a344mol wt 0:08206gas const \u00a3310K= 0:114gCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 241 Explore 5.5.2 . Draw the graph of S(t) = 300 e\u00a10:05ton your calculator and compare it with the graph you drew in the previous Explore. Example 5.5.5 Classical Saturation Curve. Problem. Suppose a 100 liter barrel is full of pure water and at time t= 0 minutes a stream of water \u00b0owing at 5 liters per minute and carrying 3 g/liter of salt starts \u00b0owing into the barrel. Assume the salt is well mixed in the barrel and water over\u00b0ows at the rate of 5 liters per minute. Let S(t) be the amount of salt in the barrel at time tminutes after the salt water starts \u00b0owing in. Explore 5.5.3 Draw a graph of what you think will be the graph of S(t). In doing so consider \u00b2What is S(0)? \u00b2Does S(t) increase or decrease? \u00b2Is there an upper bound on S(t), the amount of salt in the barrel that will be in the barrel? Solution: We analyze S; again we use Primitive Concept 2. The concentration of salt in the in\u00b0ow is 3 g/liter. The concentration C(t) of salt in the tank a time tminutes is C(t) =S(t) 100 The salt concentration in the out\u00b0ow will also be C(t). Therefore Rate of change of salt = Rate salt enters \u00a1 Rate salt leaves in the barrel the barrel the barrel S0(t) = C1\u00a3R1 \u00a1 L\u00a3L ming L\u00a3L min Initially the barrel is full of pure water, so S(0) = 0 We now have S(0) = 0 S0(t) = 15 \u00a10:05S(t)(5.22) This equation is not in the form of P0(t) =kP(t) because of the 15. Proceed as follows. Equilibrium. Ask, 'At what value, E, ofS(t) would S0(t) = 0?' That would require 0 = 15 \u00a10:05E= 0;orE= 300g :Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 242 E= 300 g is the equilibrium level of salt in the barrel. We focus attention on the di\u00aeerence, D(t), between the equilibrium level and the current level of salt. Thus D(t) = 300 \u00a1S(t) and S(t) = 300 \u00a1D(t) Now, D(0) = 300 \u00a1S(0) = 300 \u00a10 = 300 Furthermore, = [300 We substitute Equations 5.22 = 300 D0(t) = \u00a10:05D(t) This is in the form of the Exponential Growth and Decay Property 5.5.2, and we write D(t) = 300 e\u00a10:05t Returning to S(t) = 300 \u00a1D(t) we write S(t) = 300 \u00a1D(t) = 300 \u00a1300e\u00a10:05t The graph of S(t) = 300 \u00a1300e\u00a10:05tis shown in Figure 5.3. Curiously, the graph of S(t) is also called an exponential decay curve. S(t) is not decaying at all; S(t) is increasing. What is decaying exponentially is D(t), the remaining salt capacity. Explore 5.5.4 Show that if S(t) = 300 \u00a1300e\u00a10:05t, then S(0) = 0 ; and S0(t) = 15 \u00a10:05S(t): 5.5.2 Continuous-space analysis of light depletion. As observed in Chapter 1, light intensity decreases as one descends from the surface of a lake or ocean. There we was divided the water into discrete layers and it was assumed that each layer absorbs a \u00afxed fraction, F, of the light that enters it from above. This hypothesis led to the di\u00aeerence equation Id+1\u00a1Id=\u00a1F\u00a3Id Light is actually absorbed continuously as it passes down through a (homogeneous) water medium, not in discrete layers. We examine the light intensity, I(x), at a distance, xmeters, below the surface of a lake or ocean, assuming that the light intensity penetrating the surface is a known quantity, I0. We start by testing an hypothesis about light transmission in water that appears di\u00aeerent from the hypothesis we arrived at in Chapter 1:Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 243 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90050100150200250300350 Saturation = 300 g D(t) S(t) Time minutesSalt in the barrel grams Figure 5.3: The graph of S(t) = 300 \u00a1300e\u00a10:05tdepicting the amount of salt in a barrel initially \u00aflled with 100 liters of pure water and receiving a \u00b0ow of 5 L/m carrying 3 g/L.

I(x) is light intensity at depth xdue to light of intensity I0just below the surface of the water. Mathematical Model 5.5.4 Light Absorbance: The amount of light absorbed by a (horizontal) layer of water is proportional to the thickness of the layer and to the amount of light entering the layer (see Figure 5.4). The mathematical model of light absorbance implies, for example, that 1.The light absorbed by a water layer of thickness 2\u00a2 is twice the light absorbed by a water layer of thickness \u00a2 and 2.A layer that absorbs 10% of a dim light will absorb 10% of a bright light. We know from experimental evidence that implication (1) is approximately true for thin layers and for low levels of turbidity. Implication (2) is valid for a wide range of light intensities.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 244 Double Proportionality. The mathematical model of light absorbance the light absorbed by a layer is proportional to two things, the thickness of the layer and the intensity of the light entering the layer. We handle this double proportionality by assuming that the amount of light absorbed in a layer is proportional to the product of the thickness of the layer and the intensity of the light incident to the layer. That is, there is a number, K, such that if I(x) is the light intensity at depth xandI(x+ \u00a2x) is the light intensity at depth x+ \u00a2x, then I(x+ \u00a2x)\u00a1I(x):=\u00a1K\u00a3\u00a2x\u00a3I(x) (5.23) The product, K\u00a3\u00a2x\u00a3I(x), has the advantage that 1.For \u00afxed incident light intensity, I(x), the light absorbed, I(x+ \u00a2x)\u00a1I(x), is proportional to the thickness, \u00a2 x, (proportionality constant = \u00a1K\u00a3I(x)) and 2.For \u00afxed thickness \u00a2 x, the light absorbed is proportional to the incident light, I(x) (proportionality constant = \u00a1K\u00a3\u00a2x). Equation 5.23 I(x+ \u00a2x)\u00a1I(x) \u00a2x:=\u00a1KI(x) The approximation (:=) improves as the x, approaches zero. As \u00a2 x!0I(x+ \u00a2x)\u00a1I(x) \u00a2x!I0(x) and we conclude that I0(x) =\u00a1KI(x) (5.24) The Exponential Growth and Decay Property 5.5.2 implies that because I0(x) =\u00a1KI(x); I (x) =I0e\u00a1Kx(5.25) Example 5.5.6 Assume that 1000 w/m2of light is striking the surface of a lake and that 40% of that light is re\u00b0ected back into the atmosphere. We \u00afrst solve the initial value problem I(0) = 600 I0(x) = \u00a1KI(x) to get I(x) = 600 e\u00a1Kx If we have additional information that, say, the light intensity at a depth of 10 meters is 400 W/m2we can \u00afnd the value of K. It must be that I(10) = 600 e\u00a1K\u00a310= 400Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 245 The only unknown in the last equation is K, and we solve 600e\u00a1K\u00a310= 400 e\u00a1K\u00a310= 400 =600 = 5 = ln =3) K:= 0:040557 Thus we could say that I(x) = 600 \u00a3e\u00a10:040557 x If we know, for example, that 30 W/m2of light are required for a certain species of coral to grow, we can ask for the maximum depth, x, at which we might \u00afnd that species. We would solve I(x) = 30 time and half-life Suppose kandCare positive numbers. The doubling time ofF(t) =Cektis a number tdblsuch that for any time t F (t+tdbl) = 2\u00a3F(t): That there is such a number written that for any time t F (t+t1=2) =1 2\u00a3F(t): Using steps similar to those for the doubling time you can \u00afnd that t1=2=ln 2 k: (5.27)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 246 A 0 20 40 60 8000.050.10.150.20.25 Time Min Population Density 26 48 70 B 101234567891000.10.20.30.4 Depth layersLight Intensity 0 3.5 7 Figure 5.5: A.

In Figure 5.5B is a graph of light intensity decay from Figure 1.10 (repeated in Figure 5.6) and of the Equation 1.15 Id= 0:400\u00a30:82d Because 0:198= 3:5 3.5 layers of muddy water the light intensity decays by one-half. d1=2is a distance and might be called 'half depth' rather than 'half life.' 'Half life' is the term used for all exponential decay, however, and you are well advised to use it. Example 5.5.7 Problem . Suppose a patient has taken 80 mg of Sotolol, a drug that regularizes heart beat, once per day for several days. Sotolol has a half-life in the body of 12 hrs. There will be an historical accumulation, H, of Sotolol in the body due to previous days' pills, and each day when the 80 mg pill is taken there will be H+ 80 mg of Sotolol in the body that will decrease according to the 12 hr half-life. Find the historical accumulation, H, and the daily \u00b0uctuation. Solution. LetAtbe the amount of Sotolol in the body at time thours during the day, with t= 0 being the time the pill is taken each day. Then A\u00a1 0=H and A+ 0=H+ 80: Furthermore, because the half-life is 12 hours, A\u00a1 24, the amount left in the body just before the pill is taken the next day, is A\u00a1 24=1 4A+ 0=1 4(H+ 80) ;Cornette and Ackerman, 2010 247 and A\u00a1 24=H Therefore, 1 4(H+ 80) = H; H =4 320 = 26 :7mg Furthermore, A+ 0=H+ 80 = 106 :7mg so the amount of Sotolol in the body \u00b0uctuates from 26.7 mg to 106.7 mg, a four to one ratio. You are asked to compare this with taking 40 mg of Sotolol twice per day in Exercise 5.5.5 5.5.4 Semilogarithm and LogLog graphs. Functions P(t) that equation P0(t) =k\u00a3P(t) may be written P(t) =P0ektand +kt. The graph a straight line with intercept ln P0and slope k. Similarly, if P0(t) =\u00a1kP(t) the graph of ln P(t)vstis a straight line with slope (in rectilinear coordinates) \u00a1k. A scientist with data t; P(t) that she thinks is exponential may plot the graph of lnP(t)vst. If the graph is linear, then a \u00aft of a line to that data will lead to an exponential relation of the form P(t) =AektorP(t) =Ae\u00a1kt. She may then search for a biological process that would justify a model P0(t) =\u00a7kP(t). Example 5.5.8 In Section 1.3 we showed the results of an experiment measuring the light decay as a function of depth. The data and a semilog graph of the data are shown in Figure 5.6. Depth Id Layer mW/cm2 0 0.400 1 0.330 2 0.270 (Intensity) 0.4 0.087 Depth Figure 5.6: Data and a semilog graph of the data showing experimental results of measuring light decrease with depth of water. As shown in the \u00afgure, log10Id=\u00a10:4\u00a10:087\u00a3d is a good approximation to the data. Therefore Id:= 10\u00a10:4\u00a10:087d = 0:4\u00a30:82dCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 248 which is the same result obtained in Section 1.3. As shown in the previous subsection, the relation I0(d) =\u00a1k\u00a3I(d) corresponds to a process underlying light depletion in water. 5.5.5 Relative Growth Rates and Allometry. Ifyis a positive function of time, the relative growth rate of yis y0(t) y(t)Relative Growth Rate. (5.28) The relative growth rate of yis sometimes called the fractional growth rate or the logarithmic growth rate. De\u00afnition 5.5.1 Allometry. . Two functions, xandy, of time are said to be allometrically related if there are numbers Candasuch that y(t) log C+alogx; (5.30) for any base of log. Therefore if log yis plotted vslogxthe graph should be a straight line. Explore 5.5.6 Show that if xandysatisfy Equation 5.30, log y(t) = x(t): Conclude that if xandyare allometric then the relative growth rate of yis proportional to the relative growth rate of x. Shown in Figure 5.7 is a graph of log10of the weight of large mouth bass vslog10of their length7. The data appear linear and we conclude that the weight is allometric to the length. An equation of a line close to the data islogy\u00a11:05 logx\u00a12:0=2:6\u00a11:05 2:5\u00a12:0; logy=\u00a15:75 + 3 :1 logx Then y= 10\u00a15:75x3:1 The weights of the bass are approximately proportional to the cube of the lengths. This is consistent with the fact that the volume of a cube is equal to the cube of the length of an edge. Many interesting allometric relations are not supported by underlying models, however (Exercises ??, 5.5.26, and 5.5.25). 7Data from Robert Summerfelt, Iowa State University.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 249 101102103100101102103104 Length of Largemouth Bass mmWeight of Largemout Bass g 1.5 2.0 2.5(2, 1.05)(2.5, 2.60) Figure 5.7: Weight vsLength for large mouth bass plotted on a log-log graph.

Exercise 5.5.5 In Example 5.5.7 it was shown that in a patient who takes 80 mg of Sotolol once per day, the daily \u00b0uctuation of Sotolol is from 26.7 mg to 106.7 mg. Sotolol has a half-life in the body of 12 hours. What is the \u00b0uctuation of Sotolol in the body if the patient takes two 40 mg of Sotolol at 12 hour intervals in the day? Would you recommend two 40 mg per day rather than one 80 mg pill per day? Exercise 5.5.6 A patient takes 10 mg of coumadin once per day to reduce the probability that he will experience blood clots.

Age determined by rubidium-87 to strontium-87 decomposition is an excellent check of40K to40Ar ages.

Carbon-14 develops in the upper atmosphere as neutrons bombard nitrogen, and subsequently combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. About 1 in 1012CO2atoms is formed with14C in today's atmosphere. Plants metabolize14CO2(almost) as readily as12CO2, and resulting sugars are metabolized equally by animals that eat the plants. Consequently carbon from living material is 1 part in 1012 carbon-14. Upon death, no additional14C is absorbed into the material and14C gradually decomposes into nitrogen. Slightly confounding the use of radio carbon dating is the fact that the fraction of atmospheric14C02has not been historically constant at 1 molecule per 1012molecules of12CO2. Carbon-14 decomposes to nitrogen (5.31) where \u00af\u00a1denotes an electron antineutrino. One of the neutrons of14 6C looses an electron and becomes a proton. Mathematical Model 5.5.5 Carbon-14 decay. The rate of decomposition of14 6C in a sample is proportional to the size of the sample. One-half of the atoms in a sample will decompose in 5730 years. a.Write and solve a derivative equation that will show for a sample of14Cinitially of size C0what the size will be tyears later. b.In tissue living today, the amount of14Cin one gram of carbon is approximately 10\u00a112grams. Assume for this problem that the same ratio in living material has persisted for the last 10,000 years. Also assume that upon death the only change in carbon of any form is the decrease in14C due to decomposition to nitrogen. Suppose a 100 gram sample of carbon from bone is found to have 3 \u00a310\u00a111grams of14C. What is the age of the sample? c.Suppose that during the time 10,000 years ago until 2,000 years ago the amount of14Cin one gram of carbon in living tissue was approximately 1 :05\u00a310\u00a112grams.

Light is passed through a sample of the medium and the amount of light that is absorbed by the medium is an indicator of cell density. As cell density increases the amount of light absorbed increases. A standard is established by passing a light beam of intensity I0through a 0.5 cm layer of the growth medium without bacteria and the intensity Istof the beam emerging from the medium is measured. See Figure Ex. 5.5.17. Figure for Exercise 5.5.17 Diagram of spectrophotometer. A light beam of in- tensity I0enters the standard solution and the intensity Istof the emerging beam is measured. A light beam of the same intensity I0enters the sample solution and the intensity Ismof the emerging beam is measured. See Exercise 5.5.17. I0IStStandard I0ISmSample A light beam of the same intensity I0enters the sample solution and the intensity Ismof the emerging beam is measured. In the mathematical model of light absorbance (the amount of light absorbed by a layer of water is proportional to the thickness of the layer and to the amount of light entering the layer), the proportionality constant Kis a measure of the opacity of the water. Recall that the solution Equation 5.25 is I(x) =I0e\u00a1Kx. The bacteria in the sample placed in the spectrophotometer increase the opacity of the liquid.

Plasma circulates through the kidney at the rate of 1.2 liters/minute and the kidneys remove 20 per cent of the penicillin that passes through. a.Draw a schematic diagram showing the vascular pool and kidneys as separate entities, an artery leading from the vascular pool to the kidney and a vein leading from the kidney back to the vascular pool.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 255 b.LetP(t) be the amount of penicillin in the vascular pool tminutes after injection of penicillin.

Will it be high enough to control the infection you wish to control? If not, what should you do? f.Suppose your patient has impaired kidney function and that plasma circulates through the kidney at the rate of 0.8 liters per minute and the kidneys remove 15 percent of the penicillin that passes through. What is the saturation level of penicillin in this patient, assuming you administer penicillin the same as before? Exercise 5.5.19 An egg is covered by a hen and is at 37\u00b1C.

Material: A thistle tube, a 1 liter \u00b0ask, some `salt water', and some pure water, a membrane that is impermeable to the salt and is permeable to the water. The bulb of the thistle tube is \u00aflled with salt water, the membrane is place across the open part of the bulb, and the bulb is inverted in a \u00b0ask of pure water so that the top of the pure water is at the juncture of the bulb with the stem. See the diagram. Because of osmotic pressure the pure water will cross the membrane pushing water up the stem of the thistle tube until the increase in pressure inside the bulb due to the water in the stem matches the osmotic pressure across the membrane.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 256 Our problem is to describe the height of the water in the stem as a function of time. Mathematical Model 5.5.7 Osmotic di\u00aeusion across a membrane. The rate at which pure water crosses the membrane is proportional to the osmotic pressure across the membrane minus the pressure due to the water in the stem. Assume that the volume of the bulb is much larger than the volume of the stem so that the concentration of `salt' in the thistle tube may be assumed to be constant. Introduce notation and write a derivative equation with initial condition that will describe the height of the water in the stem as a function of time. Solve your derivative equation. Exercise 5.5.21 2 kilos of a \u00afsh poison are mixed into a lake which has a volume of 100\u00a320\u00a32 = 4000 cubic meters. A stream of clean water \u00b0ows into the lake at a rate of 1000 cubic meters per day. Assume that it mixes immediately throughout the whole lake.

Exercise 5.5.22 Continuous version of Chapter Exercise 1.7. Atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude. Derive a dynamic equation from the following mathematical model, solve the dynamic equation, and use the data to evaluate the parameters of the solution equation.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 257 Mathematical Model 5.5.8 Mathematical Model of Atmospheric Pressure. Consider a vertical column of air based at sea level and assume that the temperature within the column is constant, equal to 20\u00b1C. The pressure at any height is the weight of air in the column above that height divided by the cross sectional area of the column. In a 'short' section of the column, by the ideal gas law the the mass of air within the section is proportional to the product of the volume of the section and the pressure within the section (which may be considered constant and equal to the pressure at the bottom of the section). The weight of the air above the lower height is the weight of air in the section plus the weight of air above the upper height. Sea-level atmospheric pressure is 760 mm Hg and the pressure at 18,000 feet is one-half that at sea level. Exercise 5.5.23 When you open a bottle containing a carbonated soft drink, CO 2dissolved in the liquid turns to gas and escapes from the liquid. If left open and undisturbed, the drink goes \u00b0at (looses its CO 2). Write a mathematical model descriptive of release of carbon dioxide in a carbonated soft drink. From your model, write a derivative equation descriptive of the carbon dioxide content in the liquid minutes after opening the drink. Exercise 5.5.24 Decompression illness in deep water divers. In the 1800's technology was developed to supply compressed air to under water divers engaged in construction of bridge supports and underwater tunnels. While at depth those divers worked without unusual physical discomfort. Shortly after ascent to the surface, however, they might experience aching joints, numbness in the limbs, fainting, and possible death. A\u00aeected divers tended to walk bent over and were said to have the \\bends\". It was believed that nitrogen absorbed by the tissue at the high pressure below water was expanding during ascent to the surface and causing the di\u00b1culty, and that a diver who ascended slowly would be at less risk. The British Navy commissioned physician and mathematician J. S. Haldane9to devise a dive protocol to be followed by Navy divers to reduce the risk of decompression illness. Nitrogen \u00b0ows quickly between the lungs and the plasma but nitrogen exchange between the plasma and other parts of the body (nerve, brain tissue, muscle, fat, joints, liver, bone marrow, for example) is slower and not uniform. Haldane used a simple model for nitrogen exchange between the plasma and the other parts of the body. Mathematical Model 5.5.9 Nitrogen absorption and release in tissue. The rate at which nitrogen is absorbed by a tissue is proportional to the di\u00aeerence in the partial pressure of nitrogen in the plasma and the partial pressure of nitrogen in the tissue. Air is 79 percent nitrogen. Assume that the partial pressure of nitrogen in the lungs and the plasma are equal at any depth. At depth d, Plasma pp N 2= atmospheres. is the partial pressure of nitrogen in a diver's lungs at the surface? b.Suppose a diver has not dived for a week. What would you expect to be the partial pressure of nitrogen in her tissue? 9J. S. Haldane was the father of J. B. S. Haldane who, along with R. A. Fisher and Sewall Wright developed the \u00afeld of population genetics.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 258 c.A diver who has not dived for a week quickly descends to 30 meters. What is the nitrogen partial pressure in her lungs after descending to 30 meters? d.LetN(t) be the partial pressure of nitrogen in a tissue of volume, V,tminutes into the dive. Use the Mathematical Model 5.5.9 Nitrogen absorption and release in tissue and Primitive Concept 2, to write an equation for N0. e.Check to see whether ( kis a 10! \u00a10:79d Vt(5.33) solves your equation from the previous step. f.Assumek Vin Equation 5.33 is 0.0693 and d= 30. What is N(30)? g.Haldane experimented on goats and concluded that on the ascent to the surface, N(t) should never exceed two times Lung pp N 2. A diver who had been at depth 30 meters for 30 minutes could ascend to what level and not violate this condition ifk V= 0.0693? Exercise 5.5.25 E. O. Wilson, a pioneer in study of area-species relations on islands, states in Diversity of Life , p 221, : \\In more exact language, the number of species increases by the area-species equation, S=C Az, where Ais the area and S is the number of species. Cis a constant and zis a second, biologically interesting constant that depends on the group of organisms (birds, reptiles, grasses).

Suppose an increasing function u(t) has a derivative for all t. We establish h eu(t)i0=eu(t)\u00a3u0(t) Exponential Chain Rule. (5.34) The Exponential Chain Rule is used to prove [ lnt]0=1 t; Logarithm Rule. (5.35) and, assuming uis positive, [ lnu(t) ]0=1 u(t)\u00a3u0(t) Logarithm Chain Rule. (5.36) Recall Theorem 4.2.1, The Derivative Requires Continuity. If u(t) is a function and u0(t) exists at t=a lim b!au(b) = u(a)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 261 Proof of the exponential chain rule. Suppose u(t) has a derivative at t=aandE(t) =eu(t). To simplify the argument we assume that u(t) is a strictly increasing function. That is, if a < b , then u(a)< u(b), and, in particular, u(b)\u00a1u(a)6= 0. b!aeu(b)\u00a1eu(a) u(b)\u00a1u(a)=eu(a) requires some explanation. The graph of y=exis shown in Figure 5.8. At every point, ( x ; ex) of the graph, the slope of the tangent is ex, and speci\u00afcally at the point ( u(a); the slope is m=eu(a). The di\u00aeerence quotient eu(b)\u00a1eu(a) u(b)\u00a1u(a) is the slope of a secant to the graph. Because lim b!au(b) =u(a) the slope of the secant approaches the slope the tangent. Thus lim b!aeu(b)\u00a1eu(a) of y=ex. Because u0(a) asb!a. Therefore the slope of the secant,u(b)\u00a1u(a) b\u00a1a, approaches the slope of the tangent, eu(a).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 262 Example 5.6.1 Find the derivatives of P(x) e\u00a1x2=2i0Constant Factor Rule = 200 e\u00a13x[\u00a13x]0=1p 2\u00bce\u00a1x2=2[\u00a1x2=2]0Exponential Chain Rule = 200 e\u00a13x(\u00a13) =1p 2\u00bce\u00a1x2=2(\u00a1x) Constant Factor and Power Rules The derivative of P(x) = 200 e\u00a13xalso can be computed using the ektRule. The ektrule is a special case of the exponential chain rule: h ekti0=ekt[kt]0=ektk: The derivative of L(t) = ln t.The exponential chain rule 5.34 is used to derive the natural logarithm rule. In order to use the formulah eu(t)i0=eu(t)u0(t) it is necessary to know that u0(t) exists. We want to computeh elnti0and need to know that [ ln t]0exists. Our argument for this is shown in Figure 5.9. Also observe that Lis increasing so that our argument for the exponential chain rule which assumed that u(t) was increasing is su\u00b1cient for this use. Knowing that [ ln t]0exists, it is easy to obtain a formula for it. elnt=t a. h elnti0= [t]0b. elnt[ tAlgebra9 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>= >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>;(5.37) We have now proved the natural logarithm rule, another Primary Formula: Natural Logarithm Rule [lnt]0=1 t(5.38)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 263 E(t) = et L(t) = ln t(a, b) (b, E(t) =etandL(t) = ln tand tangents at corresponding points.

For any other base, b >0, the exponential function B(t) =bthas a derivative, but B0(t) =bt\u00a3lnbhas the extra factor lnb. The natural logarithm function, L(t) = loget= lntalso has a simple derivative, 1 =t, and its derivative is the simplest among all logarithm functions. For L(t) = logbt,L0(t) = (1 =t)\u00a3(lnb). The function E(t) =ekthas the property E0(t) =ekt\u00a3k=k\u00a3E(t) Many mathematical models of biological and physical systems yield equations of the form y0(t) =ky(t), and for that reason we frequently use the exponential function ektto describe natural phenomena. When analyzing data thought to be exponential, a semilog graph of the data will often signal whether the data is indeed exponential. The exponential and logarithm chain rules h eu(t)i0=eu(t)\u00a3u0(t) [ ln ( u(t) ) ]0=1 u(t)\u00a3u0(t) expand the class of functions for which we can compute derivatives, and the logarithm chain rule is used to extend the power chain rule for integer exponents to all values of the exponent.

The basic derivative formulas that you need are shown below. Many additional derivative formulas are derived from them. The trigonometric derivatives are develop in Chapter 7. The last three Com- bination Rules are developed in this chapter. Primary Formulas [C]0= 0 [ tn]0=ntn\u00a11 [et]0=et[ lnt]0=1 t [ 12, 2010 270 6.1 Derivatives of Products and Quotients. Derivatives of products. We determine the derivative of a function, P, that is a product of two functions, P(t) =u(t)\u00a3v(t) in terms of the values of u(t),u0(t),v(t) and v0(t); all four are required. The formula we obtain is [u(t)\u00a3v(t) ]0=u0(t)\u00a3v(t) +u(t)\u00a3v0(t) (6.2) It is not a very intuitive formula. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives of the functions. One might expect derivative of the product of two functions to be the product of the derivatives of the two functions. Alas, this is seldom correct, but were it correct your learning of calculus would be notably simpli\u00afed. The correct formula is used as follows. Let P(t) 3t2\u00a3e\u00a12t+t3\u00a3e\u00a12t\u00a3(\u00a12) A product of functions is useful, for example, in examining the factors a\u00aeecting total corn production. Total production, P(t), is the product of the number of acres planted, A(t), and the average yield per acre, Y(t). The factors that a\u00aeect A(t) and Y(t) are distinct. The acres planted, A(t), is a\u00aeected mostly by government programs and anticipated price of corn; the yield, Y(t) is a\u00aeected mostly by natural events such as weather and insect prevalence and by improved genetics and farming practices. Government economists often try to maintain total production, P(t), at a fairly constant level, but can a\u00aeect only A(t), the number of acres planted. Other instances in which a function is inherently a product of component parts include 1.In simple epidemiological models, the number of newly infected is proportional to the product of the number of infected and the number of susceptible. 2.The rate of a binary chemical reaction A + B \u00a1!AB is usually proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two constituents of the reaction. We prove the following theorem: Theorem 6.1.1 Suppose uandvare two Requires Continuity: In symbols: lim b!au(b)\u00a1u(a) b\u00a1a=u0(a) exists implies that lim b!au(b) =u(a):Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 271 which step of Equations 6.4 was Theorem 4.2.1, The Derivative Requires Continuity, used? Derivatives of quotients. The tan x=sinx cosxis the quotient of two functions, sin xand cos x. The logistic function, L(x) =10ex 9+ex, used to describe population growth and chemical reactions is the quotient of two exponential functions. There is a formula for computing the rate of change of quotients: Theorem 6.1.2 Suppose uandvare functions and v2(a) is 4.2.1, The Derivative Requires Continuity, used in Equations 6.6? Example 6.1.1 The logistic function and its derivative. The logistic function P(t) =P0Mert M\u00a1P0+P0ert (6.7) describes the size of a population of initial size P0with low density relative growth rate rgrowing in an environment with limited carrying capacity M. After the function ekt, the logistic function is the most important function in population biology. The graph of a typical logistic curve is shown in Figure 6.1. Obviously, population growth rate is important, and we use the quotient rule to compute P0(t).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 273 M P0tP(t) Figure 6.1: The graph of a logistic curve P(t) = P0Mert=(M\u00a1P0+P0ert). The dashed curve is the graph ofp(t) =P0ertshowing the close approximation to ex- ponential P0. Steps f. and g. characterize the population growth rate as P0(t) =rP(t)\u00c3 1\u00a1P(t) M! (6.9)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 274 The fraction P(t)=Mis the density of the population. If the density is small (population size, P(t), is small compared to the environmental carrying capacity, M), the factor 1 \u00a1P(t)=Mis close to 1 and `almost' P0(t) =rP(t). Almost P0(t)=P(t) =rand for that reason ris called the low density relative growth rate ofP. We compare P(t) with the function p(t) which satis\u00afes the simpler equation p(0) = P0; p0(t) =rp(t) We know from Section 5.5 that p(t) =P0ert The graph of p(t) is shown as the dashed curve in Figure 6.1 where it is seen that p(t) is close to P(t) while P(t) is small. The number M\u00a1P(t) is the unused environment, or the residual environmental capacity . When P(t) is almost as large as M(the density is large), the residual capacity M\u00a1P(t) is close to zero and the factor (1 \u00a1P(t)=M) is close to zero. From Equation 6.9 the growth rate of the population P0(t) is also close to zero. Equation 6.9 is consistent with: Mathematical Model 6.1.1 Mathematical model of logistic growth. The growth rate of a population is proportional to the size of the population and is proportional to the residual capacity of the environment in which the population is growing. We acknowledge that we have reversed the usual role of modeling. We began with a reported solution equation, obtained a derivative equation, and then wrote the model. The steps are reversed with respect to the accepted order in Chapter 1, and with respect to Pierre Verhulst's development of the model in 1838.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 275 Example 6.1.2 Examples of computing the derivatives of products and quotients. a: P(t) 6.1, Derivatives of Products and Quotients.

Exercise 6.1.20 Crows on the west coast of Canada feed on a mollusk called a whelk (shown in Figure 6.2)2. The crows break the whelk shell to obtain the meat inside by lifting the whelk to a height of about 5 meters and dropping it onto a rock.

Reto Zach (1978,1979) investigated the behavior of crow feeding as an example of decision making while foraging for food, and concluded that crows break the whelk in a manner that minimized their e\u00aeort (optimal foraging).

The vertical ascent and drop are repeated until the whelk breaks. Zach made two interesting observations: 1.The crows fed only on large whelk. When large whelk were not available, crows selected another food source. 2.Consistently the crows dropped the whelk from a height of about 5 meters. Zach gathered whelks from the intertidal zone, separated them into small, medium, and large categories, and dropped them repeatedly at a given height until they broke.

On average, how many drops does it take to break a large whelk from the optimum height, H0? Summary. The work required to break a medium sized whelk is twice that require to break a large whelk, and the optimum height from which to drop a large whelk is 6.1 meters, reasonably close to the 5.58 meters obtained by Zach. A similar behavior is observed in sea gulls feeding on mussels. A large mussel broken on the second drop by a gull is shown in Figure 6.4; attached to the large mussel shell is a small mussel that the gull did not bother to break.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 282 Figure 6.4: A large mussel shell broken by a gull on the second drop.

The Power Chain Rule, the Exponential Chain Rule, and the Logarithm Chain Rule have a common pattern and we list all three to show the similarity: If a function, u(t), has derivative then [u(t)n]0=nu(t)n\u00a11\u00a3[u(t) ]0Power Chain Rule Chain Rule [ lnu(t) ]0=1 u(t)\u00a3[u(t) ]0Logarithm Chain Rule All three of these are of the form [G(u(t) ) ]0=G0(u(t) the second column is the derivative with respect to u, the independent variable of G, and will normally be computed using a Primary Formula.

Then G(u(t) a derivative for all tand [G(u(t) ) ]0=G0(u(t))\u00a3[u(t)]0(6.17) Proof: The argument is similar to that for the exponential chain rule. The di\u00aeerence is that we now have a general function G(u) rather than the speci\u00afc functions eu. We argue only for uan increasing function, and we need Theorem 4.2.1, The Derivative Requires Continuity.

It does not immediately expand the collection of functions for which we can compute the derivative. To use the chain rule on G(u(t) ) we need G0(u) which requires a Primary derivative formula. The relevant Primary derivative formulas so far developed are the power, exponential and logarithm Primary formulas, for which we have already developed chain rules. In the next chapter, we develop the Primary formula [ sint]0= cos t Then from the chain rule of this section, we immediately have the chain rule [ sin( u(t) ) ]0= cos( u(t) )\u00a3u0(t) Using this we can, for example, compute [ sin( \u00bct) ]0as [ sin( \u00bct) ]0= cos( \u00bct)\u00a3[\u00bct]0 = cos( \u00bct)\u00a3\u00bc Leibnitz notation.

At what rate is the radius of the balloon increasing when the volume is 3000 cm3? Note: V(t) =4 3\u00bcr3(t). Exercise 6.2.6 Consider a spherical ice ball that is melting. A reasonable model is: Mathematical Model. 1.The rate at which heat is transferred to the ice ball is proportional to the surface area of the ice ball. 2.The rate at which the ball melts is proportional to the rate at which heat is transferred to the ball.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 288 The volume, V, of a sphere of radius r is4 3\u00bcr3and its surface area, S, is 4\u00bcr2. From 1 and 2 we conclude that the rate of change of volume of the ice ball is proportional to the surface area of the ice ball. a.Write an equation representative of the previous italicized statement. b.As the ball melts, V,r, and V0(t) = 4 \u00bcr2(t)r0(t) c.Use your equation from (a) and the equation from (b) to show that r0(t) =K where Kis a constant d.Why should Kshould be negative, we good candidate for r(t) is r(t) =\u00a1Kt+C where Cis a constant Why? f.Only discussion included part. that W(t) =A(1\u00a1t=B)3where AandBare constants andW(t) is the weight of the ball. In order to test this conclusion, we \u00aflled a plastic ball about the size of a volley ball with water and froze it to -14\u00b1C (Figure 6.2.6). One end of a chord (knotted) was frozen into the center of the ball and the other end extended outside the ball as a handle. We removed the plastic and placed the ball in a 10\u00b1C water bath, held below the surface by a weight attached to the ball. At four minute intervals we removed the ball and weighed it and returned to the bath. The data from one of these experiments is shown in Table 6.2.6 and a plot of the data and of a cubic, y= 3200(1 \u00a1t=120)3, is shown in the \u00afgure of Table 6.2.6. The cubic looks like a pretty good \u00aft to the data, and we might argue that the data is consistent with our model. There are some \u00b0aws with the \u00aft of the cubic, however. The cubic departs from the data at both ends. y(0) = 3200, but the ball only weighed 3020 g; the cubic is also above the data at the right end. g.We found that we could \u00aft the data more closely with an equation of the form W(t) =A(1\u00a1t=100)\u00ae where \u00aeis closer to 2 than to 3. values for Aand\u00ae.

The inverse of a function was de\u00afned in De\u00afnition 2.6.2 in Section 2.6.2. The natural logarithm function is the inverse of the exponential function, f(t) =p tis the inverse of g(t) =t2,t\u00b80, and f(t) =3p tis the inverse of g(t) =t3, are familiar examples. We show here that 'the derivative of the inverse f\u00a11of a function fis the reciprocal of the derivative of f,' but this phrase has to be carefully explained. Example 6.3.1 The linear functions y1(x) = 1 +3 2xand y2(x) =\u00a12 3+2 3xCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 290 are each inverses of the other, and their slopes (3/2 and 2/3) are reciprocals of each other.

One line contains the points ( a; b) and ( c; d) and another line contains the points ( b; a) and (3 =2)x andy=\u00a12=3 + (2 =3)x; each is the inverse of the other and the slopes, 3/2 and 2/3 are reciprocals. The relation important to us is that their slopes are reciprocals, a general property of a function and its inverse.

The thrust of this chapter is to expand your ability to compute derivatives of functions. We have now introduced all of the combination derivative formula that you will need. Together with the Primary derivative formula already introduced and two others to be presented in the next chapter, Chapter 7, Derivatives of the Trigonometric Functions, you will be able to compute the derivatives of all of the functions you will meet in ordinary work. The basic formulas that you need are shown below. You need to be able to use them forward and backward . That is, given a function, \u00afnd its derivative, and given a derivative of a function, identify the function, or several such functions.

The trigonometric functions, sine and cosine, are useful for de- scribing periodic variation in me- chanical and biological systems. The sine and cosine functions and their derivatives are interrelated: [sint]0= cos t [cost]0=\u00a1sint The derivative equation y00(t) +y(t) = 0 is basic to mathematical models of oscillating processes, and every solution to this equation can be written in the form y(t) =Acost+Bsint where A=y(0) and B=y0(0) are constants. y = sin t y = cos t y = cos t y = sin t 296Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 297 7.1 Radian Measure. Calculus with trigonometric functions is easier when angles are measured in radians. Radian measure of an angle and the trigonometric measures of that angle are all scaled by the length of the radius of a de\u00afning circle. For use in calculus you should put your calculator in RADIAN mode. The circle in Figure 7.1 has radius 1. For the angle z0(the angle 6AOC ) the radian measure, dimensionless quantities: Radian measure of z0=length of arcz}|{ AC length of the radius=zcm, m, in, ? 1 cm, m, in, ?=z sine of z0=length of the segment AB length of the radius=ycm, m, in, ? 1 cm, m, in, ?=y cosine of z0=length of the segment OB length of the radius=xcm, m, in, ? 1 cm, m, in, ?=x OA B C1 zz y x Figure 7.1: A circle with radius 1. The radian measure of the angle z0isz, the length of the arc AC divided by the length of the radius, 1. It is obvious1from the \u00afgure that for z0in the \u00afrst quadrant 0<Length of AB < Length ofz}|{ AC 0<sinz0< z The inequality, sin z0< z, is read, `the sine of angle z0is less than z, the radian measure of z0.' We intentionally blur the distinction between the angle z0andz, the radian measure of z0, to the point that they are used interchangeably. The inequality sinz0< z is usually replaced with sin z < z; (7.1) 1Should this not be obvious then re\u00b0ect the \u00afgure about the horizontal line through O,B, and Cand let A0be the image ofAunder the re\u00b0ection. The length of the chord A0BAis less than the length of the arc, A0CA(the straight line path is the shortest path between two points).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 298 the sine of zis less than z, where zis a positive number. The de\u00afnitions of sin zand cos zfor angles that are not accute are extended by use of the unit circle, the circle with center at (0,0) and of radius 1. For zpositive, consider the arc of length zcounterclockwise along the unit circle from (1,0) to a point, ( x; y), in Figure 7.2A. For znegative consider the arc of length jzjclockwise along the unit circle from (1,0) to a point, ( x; y), in Figure 7.2B. |z| Figure 7.2: The unit circle with A. an arc of length zbetween 0 and 2 \u00bcand B. an arc of length jzjforz a negative number. From Figure 7.2B it can be seen that if zis a negative number then z <sinz <0 (7.3) A single statement that combines Equations 7.1 and 7.3 is written: jsinzj<jzj for all numbers z (7.4) We need this inequality for computing [ sin t]0in the next section, and we also need the inequality jzj<jtanzj for\u00bc 2< z <\u00bc 2: (7.5) Forz >0, examine the circle with radius 1 in Figure 7.3, z=z}|{ AC 1=z}|{ AC; and tan z=CD OC=CD: We need to show thatz}|{ AC < CDwhich appears reasonable from the \u00afgure, but we present a proof.

Thus Area of sector OAC =\u00bc12\u00a3z}|{ AC 2\u00bc\u00a31=z}|{ AC 2Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 299 0.5 0 0.5 1 1.50.500.511.5 OA CD z1 1z Figure 7.3: The unit circle and an angle z, 0< z < \u00bc= 2.

Therefore z}|{ AC 2<CD 2;z}|{ AC < CD; and z <tanz: An argument for Equation 7.5 for z <0 can be based on the re\u00b0ection of Figure 7.3 about the interval OC. In addition to the basic trigonometric identities, (sin2t+ cos2t= 1, tan t= sin t=cost, etc.) the double angle trigonometric formulas are critical to this chapter: sin(A+B) = sin AcosB+ cos AsinB cos(A+B) = cos AcosB\u00a1sinAsinB: (7.6) From these you are asked to prove in 7.1 Radian Measure.

Exercise 7.1.4 Use steps a - d below to show that at all numbers z, lim h!0sin(z+h) = sin z; (7.8) and therefore conclude that the sine function is continuous. a.Write the 2\u00b6 that lim h!0cos(z+h) = cos z; and therefore conclude that the cosine function is continuous. Hint: Look at the steps a - d of Exercise 7.1.5.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 302 7.2 Derivatives of trigonometric functions We will show that the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function, or [ sint]0= cos t (7.9) From this formula and the Combination Derivative formulas 6.1 shown at the beginning of Chapter 6, the derivatives of the other \u00afve trigonometric functions are easily computed. We \u00afrst show that [ sint]0 t=0= sin0(0) = 1 Assume his a positive number less than \u00bc=2. We know from Inequalities 7.4 and 7.5 that sinh < h < tanh We write sinh < present an opportunity to reason in a rather clever way. We wish to know whatsinh happroaches as the positive number happroaches 0 (as happroaches 0+). Because cos xis continuous (Exercise 7.1.5) and cos 0 = 1, cos happroaches 1 as happroaches 0+. Now we havesinh h`sandwiched' between two quantities, 1 and a quantity that approaches 1 as happroaches 0+. We conclude thatsinh halso approaches 1 as happroaches in the >>>>>>:1<sinh h<cosh # # # 1\u00b7 The argument can be formalized with the \u00b2,\u00b1de\u00afnition of limit, but we leave it on an intuitive basis. We have assumed h >0 in the previous steps. A similar argument can be made for h <0.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 303 We now know that the slope of the graph of the sine function at (0,0) is 1. It is this result that makes radian measure so useful in calculus. For any other angular measure, the slope of the sine function at 0 is not 1. For example, the sine graph plotted in degrees has slope of \u00bc=180 at (0,0). Because of the continuity of the composition of two functions, Equation 4.4, the equation lim h!0sinh h= 1 (7.11) may take a variety of forms: h!0sin 2h 2h= 1 lim h!0sinh 2 h 2= 1 h!0sinh2 h2= 1 We write a general form: If\u00b5(h)6= 0 for h6= 0 and lim h!0\u00b5(h) = 0 then lim h!0sin\u00b5(h) \u00b5(h)= 1 (7.12) We use lim h!0sinh 2 h 2= 1: in the next paragraph. We also use the fact that the cosine function is continuous, Exercise 7.1.5. Now we compute [ sin t]0for any t. By De\u00afnition 3.20, [ sint]0= lim 2\u00b6 sin\u00b5x\u00a1y 2\u00b6Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 304 we get [ sint]0= lim h!0sin(t+h)\u00a1sint ha. = 2d. = cos t\u00a31 = cos t e.(7.13) We have now shown that [ sin t]0= cos t. The derivatives of the other \u00afve trigonometric functions are easily computed using the derivative formulas 6.1 shown at the beginning of Chapter 6. Derivative of the cosine. We will show that [ cost]0=\u00a1sint (7.14) Observe that sin(t+\u00bc 2) = sin tcos\u00bc 2+ cos tsin\u00bc 2= sin t\u00a30 + cos t\u00a31 = cos t Therefore cost= sin( t+\u00bc 2) and [ cos t]0=\u00b7 sin(t+\u00bc 2)\u00b80 : We use the Chain Rule Equation 6.16 [G(u(t)) ]0=G0(u(t))\u00a3u0(t) with G(u) = sin u and u(t) =t+\u00bc 2: Note that G0(u) = cos uandu0(t) cos( t+\u00bc 2)\u00a3\u00b7 t+\u00bc 2\u00b80Cornette August 12, 2010 305 cos( t+\u00bc 2)\u00a31 = cos tcos\u00bc 2\u00a1sintsin\u00bc 2 =\u00a1sint We have established Equation 7.14, [ cos t]0=\u00a1sint.

Harmonic oscillations are ubiquitous in the material world.

The most simple equation that applies to oscillating systems in which the resistance to motion is negligible is: y00(t) +!2y(t) = 0 (7.24) Generally y(t) is the displacement from equilibrium of some measure of the system. The constant ! measures the strength of the force that restores the system to equilibrium. Solutions to the equation are of the form y(t) =Asin(!t) +Bcos(!t) (7.25) where AandBare constants that are determined from information about the state of the system at time 0 (for example, y(0) = 1, y0(0) = 0 implies that A= 0 and B= 1). All such functions satisfy y00(t) +!2y(t) = 0. That there are no other solutions follows from the uniqueness of solutions to linear di\u00aeerential equations usually established in di\u00aeerential equation courses. We \u00afrst establish that if y(t) =Asin(!t) then y00(t) +!2y(t) = 0. y(t) = Asin(!t)Cornette August 12, 2010 317 Acos(!t)\u00a3[!t]0 =Acos(!t)\u00a3! y00(t) = [ for y00(t) +!2y(t) =\u00b3 \u00a1A!2sin(!t)\u00b4 +!2\u00a3Asin(!t) = 0 You are asked show in Exercises 7.4.4 and 7.4.5 that y(t) =Bcos(!t) and y(t) =Asin!t+Bcos(!t) solve y00(t) +!2y(t) = 0. It is easy to visualize the motion of a mass suspended on a spring and we begin there. However, the mathematics involved is the same in many other systems; one of the powers of mathematics is that a single mathematical formulation may be descriptive of many systems. It is shown in beginning physics courses that if y(t) measures the displacement from the rest position of a body of mass msuspended on a spring (see Figure 7.7) with spring constant k, then my00(t) +ky(t) = 0 . The equation is derived by equating the two forces on the mass, Newton's Second Law of Motion F1= mass \u00a3acceleration or (7.26) Assume that the mass is held motionless a distance Abelow the equilibrium point and at time t= 0 the mass is released. Then y(0) = A and y0(0) = 0 If we let !=q k mso that !2=k mwe have y(0) = 0 y00(t) +!2y(t) = 0 (7.27) You will show in Exercise 7.4.4 that the function y(t) =Acos!t: satis\u00afes the three conditions of Equations 7.27. It gives a good description of the motion of a body suspended on a spring. The number !is important. On the time interval [0 ;2\u00bc=!], cos !tcompletes one cycle and the position, y(t), of the body progresses from Ato\u00a1Aand back to A. Thus 2\u00bc != 2\u00bcrm kis the period of one oscillation.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 318 \u00c3\u00c3````````````````````````\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3``a b c 6 ?\u00a2 E!!aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa!!! !!! !!! !!! !!!

Ifk=m is 'large' (sti\u00ae spring or small mass) the period will be 'short' and the body oscillates rapidly. If k=m is 'small' (weak spring or large mass) the period will be long, the frequency will be low and the body oscillates slowly. Example 7.4.1 Suppose a body of mass mis suspended from a spring with spring constant k. 1.Ifm= 20 gm = 0 :020 Kg and k= 0:125 Newtons/meter and the initial displacement, y0= 5 cm = 0.05 m, then !=s k m=s 0:125 Kg 0 :05 cos(2 :5t)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 319 The period of oscillation is 2\u00bc !=2\u00bc 2:51/s= 2:51 s: and 60=2:51 = 23 :9 oscillations per minute. 2.Ifm= 5 gm = 0.005 Kg (one-fourth the previous mass) and k= 0:125 Newtons/meter then the period and frequency of oscillation would be Period = 2 \u00bcrm second = 48 oscillations per minute. Thus one-fourth the mass oscillates twice as fast. 3.Ifm= 20gmand the spring extends 16 cm when the body is attached to it, then the spring constant, kis is a curious consequence of the previous analysis that the magnitude of the gravitational \u00afeld, g, is not re\u00b0ected in the model equation nor in the solution equation. The role of gis to determine equilibrium location, E. The period and frequency of the oscillations would be the same on the Moon as on Earth. There are two important omissions in the previous analysis. We have ignored the mass of the spring (which will also be moving) and we have ignored resistance to movement (by the air and in the spring). 7.4.1 Resistance. In most systems, the amplitudes of the oscillations decrease with time due to resistance to the movement orfriction in the system. Resistance is a force directed opposite to the direction of motion and may be modeled by Resistance = \u00a1r\u00a3y0(t) Including the force of resistance with the force of the spring, Equation 7.26 is modi\u00afed to my00(t) =\u00a1ky(t)\u00a1ry0(t) or my00(t) +ry0(t) +ky(t) = 0 (7.28) This is referred to as the equation of damped motion.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 320 Example 7.4.2 Suppose m= 20 gm = 0.020 kg, r = 0.06 Newtons/(meter/sec) and k= 0:125 Newtons/meter. Then the equation of damped motion is 0:02y00(t) + 0:06y0(t) + 0:125y(t) = 0 (7.29) We show that a solution to this equation is y(t) up a table of coe\u00b1cients and terms of 2tande\u00a11:5tsin 2tare 0:02\u00a3(\u00a11:75) + 0 :06\u00a3(\u00a11:5) + 0 :125\u00a31 = 0 :0 and 0 :02\u00a36 + 0 :06\u00a3(\u00a12) = 0 :0 so y(t) =e\u00a11:5tcos(2 t) solves 0 :02y00(t) + 0:06y0(t) + 0:125y(t) = 0 : In the previous problem, the resistance, r= 0:06 was selected to make the numbers in the solution (-1.5 and 2) reasonably tractable. The resistance, r= 0:06 is so great, however, that the oscillations are imperceptable after only two or three oscillations, as illustrated in Figure 7.8A.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 321 A 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 410.500.51 TimeDisplacement A 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 2010.500.51 TimeDisplacement Figure 7.8: A. Graph of of =e\u00a10:1tcos(2 A :4995t) is shown in Figure 7.8B. If the resistance in a vibrating system is quite large (system is buried in molasses), the system may not vibrate at all but may just ooze back to equilibrium after a displacement. Equation 7.28, my00(t) +ry0(t) +ky(t) = 0, may be written (divide by m) y00(t) + 2by0(t) +cy(t) = 0 (7.30) The solutions to Equation 7.30 are Bolt of Lightning 1: y(t) = A e(\u00a1b+p y(0) and y0(0). All three can be shown by substitution to solve Equation 7.30. A system with b2\u00a1c >0 is 'over damped' and does no oscillation in the system, is r2>4km{ the square of the resistance is greater than 4 times the spring constant times the mass. If the formulas above remind you of the roots to a quadratic polynomial, it is not an accident; the connection is shown in Exercise 7.4.6. The body suspended on a spring is easy to experiment with and typi\u00afes many oscillations that occur throughout nature. Other mechanical systems that have similar oscillations include the swingingCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 322 pendulum and a rotating disc (as in the \u00b0ywheel of a watch). Less apparent oscillating systems include diatomic molecules in which the distance between the two atoms oscillates very rapidly but can be approximated with the harmonic equations. In the next section we will give a simpli\u00afed biological example of oscillations in predator-prey systems. Exercises for Section 7.4, The Equation y00+!2y= 0.

Predator-prey systems are commonly cited examples of periodic oscillation in biology. Data from trapping records of the snowshoe hare and lynx gathered by trappers and sold to the Hudson Bay Company are among the most popular \u00afrst introduction. Shown in Figure 7.9 is a graph showing the numbers of pelts purchased by the Hudson Bay Company for the years 1845 to 1935, and in Table ??are values read from the graph.4 3We will try to convince you that this is reasonable in Chapter 9. 4Recent studies also demonstrate the \u00b0uctuations as shown on the web site http://lynx.uio.no/catfolk/sp-accts.htm. \\Lynx density \u00b0uctuates dramatically with the hare cycle (Breitenmoser et al. Oikos 66 (1993), pp. 551-554). An ongoing long-term study of an unexploited population in good quality habitat in the Yukon found densities of 2.8 individuals (including kittens) per 100 km2 during the hare low, and 37.2 per 100 km2 during the peak (G. Mowat and B. Slough, unpubl. data).\"Cornette and Ackerman, August snowshoe shoe hare and lynx pelts purchased by the Hudson Bay company for the years 1845 to 1945.

You should see a general counter clockwise direction to the graph. When you are in the right-most portion of the region with large hare population, the lynx population is increasing (the curve goes up). As you get to the upper right corner the lynx population has increased su\u00b1ciently that the hare population decreases (the curve goes to the left). And the pattern continues. We will return to the lynx-hare data in Exercise 7.5.6 and \u00afnd that there are exceptions to this pattern in the data. Nils Chr. Stenseth, Wilhelm Falck, Ottar N. Bjrnstad, and Charles J. Krebs, argue in Population regulation in snowshoe hare and Canadian lynx: Asymmetric food web con\u00afgurations between hare and lynx, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 5147-5152, thatCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 326 \"\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2the classic view of a symmetric harelynx interaction is too simplistic. Speci\u00afcally, we argue that the classic food chain structure is inappropriate: the hare is in\u00b0uenced by many predators other than the lynx, and the lynx is primarily in\u00b0uenced by the snowshoe hare.\" A Predator-Prey Model. Assume that there are two populations that interact as predator and prey in a reasonably isolated environment. Let U(t) denote the number of prey and V(t) denote the number of predators, and assume there are equilibrium values, UeandVe, so that Ueprey would provide enough food for Vepredators to just maintain their numbers (predator birth rate = predator death rate) andVepredators would just balance the often excess birth rate of the prey (prey birth rate = prey death rate). Shown in Figure 7.10 is an axis system where the horizontal axis is U(t) and the vertical axis is V(t). An equilibrium point, ( Ue; Ve), is plotted. If for some time, t, the populations are not at equilibrium, we let u(t) = U(t)\u00a1Ue v(t) = V(t)\u00a1Ve u(t)v(t)(U(t),V(t)) (Ue,Ve) Figure 7.10: Axes for a predator prey phase graph. The gaps in the axes allow u(t) to be small compared toUeandv(t) to be small compared to Ve. Suppose the populations U(t) and V(t) are in equilibrium and the predator population increases (perhaps some predators immigrate into the system). The excess predators would increase capture of prey, and we could expect the prey population to decrease . Alternatively, if the prey should become more numerous, the predators would have a greater food supply and their numbers may increase . Mathematical Model 7.5.1 Forsmall deviations, u(t) and v(t), from equilibrium, we assume that 1.The rate of prey population decrease ,\u00a1U0(t), is proportional to the excess predator population, v(t). 2.The rate of predator population increase ,V0(t), is proportional to the excess prey population, u(t).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 327 Thus from Part 1 we write \u00a1U0(t) =a\u00a3v(t) or U0(t) =\u00a1a\u00a3v(t) By the model, if the predator population exceeds equilibrium, V(t)> V e(v(t)>0), then U0(t)<0 and the prey population will decrease. However, if the predator population is less than normal, V(t)< V e (v(t)<0), then U0(t)>0 and the prey population increases. For this model, both populations must be assumed to be close to equilibrium. For example, a prey population greatly exceeding equilibrium, Ue might support a predator population slightly above equilibrium VEand still grow. Because u(t) =Ue+u(t) v0(t) =b\u00a3u(t) Explore 7.5.2 Show that Part 2 of the Mathematical Model 7.5.1 leads to the equation v0(t) =bu(t) where bis a proportionality constant. The two equations u0(t) = \u00a1av(t) v0(t) = bu(t) describe the dynamics of the predator { prey populations. There are two unknown functions, uandv, and the equations are linked, because u0is related to vandv0is related to u. There is a general procedure to obtain a single equation involving only u, as follows: u0(t) = \u00a1av(t) First let that !2=aband write u00(t) +!2u(t) = 0 (7.32)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 328 and see that it is equivalent to the dynamic equation in Equations 7.27. To complete the analogy, we need u(0) and u0(0). Suppose we have a predator-prey pair of populations and because of some disturbance to the environment (rain, cold, or \u00afre, for example) at a time, t= 0, the populations are at ( U0; V0), close to but di\u00aeerent from the equilibrium values ( Ue; Ve). Let the departures from equilibrium be u0=U0\u00a1Ue and v0=V0\u00a1Ve Then clearly we will use u(0) = u0. Also, from u0(t) =\u00a1av(t) we will get u0(0) =\u00a1av(0) =\u00a1av0. Thus u0 u0(0) =\u00a1av0 u00(t) +!2u(t) = 0 (7.33) From Equation 7.24 y00(t) +!2y(t) = 0, and its solution, Equation 7.25, y(t) =Asin(!t) +Bcos(!t), we conclude that u(t) will be of the form u(t) =Asin(!t) +Bcos(!t) where AandBare to be and t) =\u00a1v0ra bsin(p ab t) +u0cos(p ab t) (7.34)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 329 Explore 7.5.3 Also remember the \u00afrst equation, u0(t) =\u00a1av(t) and show that v(t) =v0cos(p ab t) +u0s b asin(p ab t) (7.35) A little trigonometry It often happens that a periodic oscillation is the sum of two oscillations of the same frequency as in Equations 7.34 and 7.35. When that happens, the two can be combined into a single sine function. Suppose F(t) =Asin(!t) +Bcos(!t) where A,B, cos\u00c1=Ap uses sin( \u00ae+\u00af) = sin \u00aecos\u00af+ cos \u00aesin\u00af.

Mathematical Model 7.5.2 Forsmall deviations, u(t) and v(t), from equilibrium, we assume that 1.The rate of prey population decreases ,\u00a1U0(t), when there is excess predator population v(t) and when there is excess prey population, u(t). 2.The rate of predator population increase ,V0(t), is proportional to the excess prey population, u(t).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 333 Step 1 can be interpreted at least two ways: A.\u00a1U0(t) could be proportional to the product ofu(t) and v(t), or B.\u00a1U0(t) could be proportional to the sumofav(t) +cu(t) where aandcare numbers.

Many biological and physical systems exhibit periodic variation governed by feed back of information from the state of the system to the driving forces of the system. An excess of predators (state of the system) drives down (driving force) the prey population. An elongation of a spring (state of the system) causes (driving force) the suspended mass to move up toward the equilibrium position. Examples of periodically varying feed back systems are presented. Exercises are distributed through the three subsections. Explore 7.6.1 Chamelons are a group of lizards that change their color to match the color of their environment. What is the color of a chamelon placed on a mirror? 7.6.1 Control switches. Some street lights and household night lights have photosensitive switches that turn the lights on at sunset and turn them o\u00ae at sunrise. In Figure 7.6.1 is a household night light with a photosensitive switch and a mirror. The mirror can be adjusted so that the light from the bulb is re\u00b0ected back to the photosensitive switch. What will be the behavior of the switch at night? With sunlight shining on it? Explore 7.6.2 You will \u00afnd it interesting to perform an experiment. In a dark room, hold a mirror about 3 inches from a night light so that it re\u00b0ects light from a night light back to the photosensitive switch. Move the mirror about 8 inches from the night light and note the change in the activity of the night light. We propose the following mathematical model for the system. Mathematical Model 7.6.1 Night lights. I There is a voltage in the photosensitive switch that increases at a rate proportional to the intensity of light striking the switch and the intensity of the light leaving the bulb decreases at a rate proportional to the voltage. The intensity of the re\u00b0ected light that strikes the switch is proportional to the intensity of the light leaving the bulb and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the bulb to the mirror. Exercise 7.6.1 a.The \u00afrst paragraph should remind you of a predator prey system. Assuming so, is the voltage the predator or the prey? b.Write equations for the mathematical Model 7.6.1. Figure for Exercise 7.6.1 A night light with a mirror that can be positioned to re\u00b0ect light back to the photosensitive switch.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 335 We propose a second mathematical model for night lights. Mathematical Model 7.6.2 Night lights. II There is a voltage in the photosensitive switch that increases at a rate proportional to the intensity of light striking the switch and dissipates at a constant rate when no light strikes the switch. The light is either on or o\u00ae; it turns on when the voltage falls below a certain threshold and turns o\u00ae when the voltage exceeds another threshold. The intensity of the re\u00b0ected light that strikes the switch is proportional to the intensity of the light leaving the bulb and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the bulb to the mirror. Exercise 7.6.2 Letv(t) be the voltage in the photosensitive switch at time tandi(t) be the illumination striking the photosensitive switch at time t. a.Write an equation descriptive of There is a voltage in the photosensitive switch that increases at a rate proportional to the intensity of light striking the switch and dissipates at a constant rate when no light strikes the switch. b.Because the light is either on or o\u00ae, it is easiest to treat the mathematical model 7.6.2 Night Light II as a discrete system.

They turn the furnace on when the temperature falls below a temperature set by the home owner and turn the furnace o\u00ae when the temperature exceeds a temperature set by the home owner. The control system of a thermostat is shown in Figure 7.6.3. There is a bi-metalic coil with a closed glass tube that tilts according to the temperature of the coil. Two wires are at one end of the tube and a small amount of mercury is inside the tube. When the temperature is \"low\" the tube tilts so that the mercury completes the connection between the two wires. When the temperature is \"high\" the coil tilts so that the mercury is at the opposite end of the tube from the wires and the connection is broken. As the temperature moves between the \"low\" and \"high\" temperatures the mercury slowly moves towards the center of the tube until a threshold angle is reached and it \u00b0ows to the opposite end of the tube. a.Write a mathematical model descriptive of temperature inside a house when the furnace is not running and the outside temperature is below the temperature inside the house.

The San Andreas fault in California is an 800 mile zone of contact between two tectonic plates, with the continental crust on the east and the oceanic crust on the west. As the oceanic crust moves north and rubs against the continental crust, at some points along the fault faces of the crust lock together and the earth bends | until a threshold distortion is surpassed. Then the faces of the crusts abruptly slide past one another sending shock waves out across the earth, and the crusts returns to a more relaxed condition. The maximum slippage recorded between two crusts is a 21 foot displacement of a road during the 1906 earthquake in the San Francisco region. A simple model of this system was described by Steven Gao of Kansas State University. Consider a body of mass mon a horizontal platform, a spring with one end attached to the body and the other end moving along the platform at a rate v. There are two frictions associated with the body, the starting friction, Fstart, and the sliding friction, Fslide, Fslide< F start: If the body is not moving relative to the platform, Fstartis the force required to initiate movement. If the body is in motion along the platform, Fslideis the force required to continue motion. The spring has a spring constant k; an elongation of length Ein the spring causes a force of magnitude k\u00a3Eon the body. Let Lbe the length of the spring when there is no tension on the spring.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 338 Figure 7.13: San Andreas Fault.

In this model, the horizontal platform is the continental crust and the body and spring are the oceanic crust. Mark a point on the platform as the zero point, let x(t) be the distance from zero to the forward face of the body, and let y(t) be the distance from zero to the forward end of the spring.

In Chaper 17, Second order and systems of two \u00afrst order di\u00aeerential equations, you will learn how to \u00afnd the function, in Equation 7.44 satis\u00afes equation 7.42, 7.43, and 7.41. Exercise 7.6.6 Equation 7.44 is valid until x0(t) next equals to zero. Use the parameters Fstart= 5; F slide= 4; k = 1; v = 0:1; and m= 1 and draw the graph of x. An elongation of E=Fstart=k= 5 initiates motion at time t1=Fstart=kv= 50, and!2=k=m = 1 with these parameters. Find the time and value of xat which x0= 0. Using the parameters of the previous exercise, the body moved 2.33 units in a time of 3.33 units; the velocity of the forward end of the spring is 0.1 so the forward end moved 0.33 units during the motion. At the time the body stopped moving, the elongation of the spring was 5 - 2.33 + 0.33 = 3. After 20 more time units, the elongation will again reach 5 and the motion of the body will be repeated.

The model we describe exhibits periodic `relief' of the tension in the spring. Do earth quakes exhibit periodicity in their recurrence? If so it would greatly simplify the prediction of earth quakes! The dates of signi\u00afcant earth quakes and their magnitudes (4.8 - 6.7) that have occurred in the Los Angeles area fault since 1920 are shown in Table 7.3. You may search the table for periodicity. As emphasized by Dr. Gao, the fault is a complex system; many small earthquakes occur every month; relief in on section may increase strain at other points. His model does, however, suggest the nature of the mechanics of an earth quake. The U.S. Geological Survey web site, http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/earthq3/, contains very interesting discussion of earthquakes.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 341 Table 7.3: Signi\u00afcant earthquakes in the Los Angeles, CA area 1920 - 1994.

Exciting current studies in molecular biology and genetics are illuminating the molecular and neural systems that control the daily rhythm of our lives, wakes us up in the morning, puts us to sleep at night, and causes `jet lag' when we travel to di\u00aeerent time zones or even without travel when daylight savings time is initiated in the Spring. The molecular clocks that control circadian rhythms have been identi\u00afed in fruit \u00b0ies, mammals, Neurospora (fungus), Arabidopsis (plant), and cyanobacteria. They are markedly similar and It appears that there has been multiple evolution of the same basic mechanism. The Neurospora mechanism is described here from a review, J. C. Dunlap, Ann. Rev. Genet. 30(1996), 579. InNeurospora , there is a gene, frq(frequency), that is transcribed into a mRNA also called frqthat codes for a protein, denoted FRQ. FRQ stimulates metabolic activities associated with daylight. A high level of FRQ also acts to shut o\u00ae transcription of the gene frqso that the concentration of mRNA frq decreases. There is a potentially oscillating system: frqincreases and causes an increase in FRQ that causes a decrease in frqso that FRQ decreases (is no longer transcribed from frqand is naturally degraded as are most proteins). However, there is resistance in the system and periodic stimulus from daylight is necessary to keep the system active and to entrain it to the daily 24 hour rhythm. Circadian time (CT) begins with 0 at dawn, 6 is noon, 12 is dusk, 18 is midnight, and 24 = 0 is dawn. The Neurospora circadian cycle begins at midnight, CT 18, at which time both frqand FRQ are at low levels, but transcription of frqbegins, say at a \u00afxed rate. After a 3 hour time lag translation of frq to create FRQ begins. At dawn, CT 0, there is a marked increase in transcription of frqand an almost immediate increase of translation to FRQ. A high level of FRQ inhibits the transcription of frqandfrq levels peak during CT 2 - 6 and declines steadily until CT 18. FRQ levels peak during CT 6 - 10 and also decline until CT 18 (the protein FRQ is constantly degraded and with decreasing levels of frqthe turnover is more rapid than production). Exercise 7.6.7 a.Draw a graph representative of the concentration of the mRNA frqas a function of time (use CT). b.Draw a graph representative of the concentration of the protein FRQ as a function of time (use CT). c.Draw a phase diagram with concentration of frqon the horizontal axis and concentration of FRQ on the vertical axis covering one 24 hour period.Chapter 8 Applications of Derivatives. Where are we going? The derivative is a powerful tool for analysis of curves, selection of optimal parameter values, and measuring the in\u00b0uence of one variable on another. If you are a doctor in the midst of a \u00b0u epidemic, you know that the number of newly infected people is increasing every day. What is important to you today is whether the rate at which newly infected people appear is increasing suggesting a future similar to A or is slowing down as in B. B is better. If the graphs represent the daily weight of an infant, however, B. could be a signal of inadequate nutrition or disease. A is better Time daysNewly Infected (or Infant Weight)BA Today 8.1 Some geometry of the derivative It is often important to know whether a population, atmospheric CO 2concentration, average temperature, white blood count, number of \u00b0u cases, etc. is increasing or decreasing with time or location, and whether the rate of increase is itself increasing or decreasing. The relation between positive, negative, and zero slopes and increasing, nondecreasing, nonincreasing, decreasing, highest points and lowest points is examined. The graph in Figure 8.1 342Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 343 illustrates three of these concepts. The graph has positive slope at every point, and is increasing. The slopes increase between points A and B, and the tangents lie below the graph. The slopes decrease between points C and D, and the tangents lie above the graph. slope = 0.30 > 0Aslope = 0.79 > 0Bslope = 0.75 > 0 Cslope = 0.31 > 0 D Figure 8.1: Graph of an increasing function. The slope is positive at every point. Between points A and B the slopes increase from 0.3 to 0.79 and the tangents lie below the curve. Between point C and D the slopes decrease from 0.75 to 0.31 and the tangents lie above the curve. In De\u00afnition 3.1.2, the derivative P0(a) of a function P(t) at a number ais the slope of the tangent to the the graph of Pat the point ( a; P(a)). The next de\u00afnition of increasing function should agree with your intuitive notions that a population is growing, or that a chemical is accumulating, or a that temperature is increasing. De\u00afnition 8.1.1 A function P, is said to be increasing if for any two numbers, aandbin the domain of P, if a < b; then P(a)< P(b): Explore 8.1.1 Do this. 1.Only one of the graphs shown in Figure 8.1.1 is the graph of an increasing function. Which one? 2.For the function that is not increasing, explain why it fails to satisfy De\u00afnition 8.1.1. 3.Does every tangent to the graph of the increasing functions have positive slope? Explore Figure 8.1.1 Graphs of an increasing function and a function that is not increasing.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 344 0 1 2 3 400.511.52 A B It may seem intuitive that if a population is growing then the growth rate is always positive. This is not true { as you may have found out from the preceding Explore 8.1.1 and is shown in the next example. Example 8.1.1 A graph of the cubic function, P(t) =t3is shown in Figure 8.1.1.1 (and in Explore Figure 8.1.1), together with the tangent to the graph at the point (0,0). P(t) =t3is an increasing function: If a < b then a3< b3. However, the tangent to the graph of Pat (0,0) is horizontal. P0(0) = 3 \u00a3t2jt=0= 3\u00a302= 0. So thatP0is not everywhere positive. Figure for Example 8.1.1.1 The graph of y=t3and its tangent at (0,0). 1.5 1 0.5 0 0.5 1 1.51.510.500.511.5 y = t3 (0, 0) The previous example is a bit of a nuisance. We would like increasing function and positive slope to be equivalent, and they are not. The fall back position is to de\u00afne non-decreasing functions which will be found to be equivalent to non-negative slopes. De\u00afnition 8.1.2 A function P, is said to be non-decreasing if for any two numbers aandbin the domain of P, if a < b; then P(a)\u00b7P(b): Note: Compare If a < b then P(a)< P(b):IncreasingCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 345 and If a < b then P(a)\u00b7P(b):Non-decreasing Every increasing function is also non-decreasing, but, for example, a constant function, P(t) =C, is non-decreasing but is not an increasing function. Explore 8.1.2 Suppose Pis a non-decreasing function. a.Argue that every di\u00aeerence quotient,P(b)\u00a1P(a) b\u00a1a, is greater than or equal to zero. (Consider two cases: a < b andb < a .) b.Suppose ais a number for which P0(a) exists. Argue that P0(a) is not a negative number. Thus if Pis a non-decreasing function, then P0(t)\u00b80 for all t(P0is nonnegative). This result is often used in reverse: IfP0(t)\u00b80 for all tthen Pis non-decreasing. That is a true statement and is Theorem 9.2.1 of Section 9.2. We use it in this chapter, but we have not yet shown it to be true. The two results may be written as a theorem to be proved in Section 9.2. Theorem 8.1.1 Suppose Pis a function de\u00afned on an interval [ a; b]. Then Pis nondecreasing on [ a; b] if and only if P0(t)\u00b80 for all tin [a; b]. Explore 8.1.3 Write de\u00afnitions of decreasing function and of non-increasing function and state a theorem about nonincreasing functions analogous to Theorem 8.1.1. We also state a related theorem to be proved in Section 9.2: Theorem 8.1.2 Suppose Pis a continuous function de\u00afned on an interval [a; b]. IfP0(t)>0 for a < t < b then Pis increasing on [ a; b]. That the converse of this theorem is not a theorem follows from the example of P(t) =t3, [a; b] = [\u00a11;1]. Example 8.1.2 The function, is an increasing function. By the previous theorem, ln is increasing if ln0is positive. ln xis only for x >0, and [lnx]0=1 x>0 for x >0Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 346 Explore 8.1.4 Is it true that ln is a nondecreasing function? Example 8.1.3 Following ingestion of a penicillin pill, the concentration, C, of penicillin in the blood is approximated by the function C(t) = 5 e\u00a10:2t\u00a15e\u00a10:3t\u00b9g ml where tis time measured in hours (Figure 8.2). 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 1600.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.8 Time hoursPenicillin concentration \u00b5g/ml Figure 8.2: The graph of C(t) = 5 e\u00a10:2t\u00a15e\u00a10:3tshowing a period of increasing blood penicillin concen- tration followed by a period of decreasing blood penicillin concentration.

Thus serum penicillin is increasing for about four hours after ingestion of the penicillin pill into the intestinal track. You were asked in Explore 8.1.3 to de\u00afne decreasing andnonincreasing . As in Explore 8.1.2, you can show that if Pis nonincreasing, then P0(t)\u00b70. By considering Q(t) = \u00a1P(t), it follows from Theorem 8.1.1 that if P0(t)\u00b70 then Pis nonincreasing, and from Theorem 8.1.2 that if P0(t)<0 for a < t < b then Pis decreasing on [ a; b]. From the preceding example of blood penicillin concentration, with C0(t) = 5\u00a3e\u00a10:3t\u00a3(\u00a10:2e0:1t+ 0:3) we observe that 0:3<0 for 10 ln 1 :5< t and we conclude that penicillin concentration is decreasing for t\u00b810 ln 1 :5:= 4:05 hours. Because the penicillin concentration is increasing during 0 to 10 ln 1 :5 hours and decreasing afterward, the maximum concentration must occur at 10 ln 1 :5 hours. That maximum concentration is C(10 ln the maximum concentration is approximately 0.74 \u00b9g/ml.

In such regions, the graph of Pisconvex upor simply convex . Similarly, when P00<0,P0is decreasing and the graph of Pisconcave down or simply concave .

End of proof of Equations 8.2 and 8.3. Proof of Theorem 5.2.2. We proceed by induction. First we prove that if a1anda2are two when a1=a2and equality holds in each expression of the previous array only when a1=a2. The statement in Theorem 5.2.2 is valid with n= 2. Now suppose Equation 8.1 is valid for sequences of length n\u00a11 and a1; a2;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2anis a sequence of positive numbers of length n. We assume without loss of generality that anis the smallest number in a1; a2;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2an, and the sequence bk=ak=an,k= 1; n. Then bk\u00b81 and bn= 1. Consequently, t=b1b2\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2bn\u00a11bn=b1b2\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2bn\u00a11\u00b81 with equality only for b1=b2=\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2=bn\u00a11= 1. Observe that b1=b2=\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2=bn\u00a11= 1 only if a1=a2=\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2=an.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 350 From Equations 8.2 and 8.3 we know that 1 + ( n\u00a11)n\u00a11p t\u00b8nnp t for t\u00b81 with equality only for t= 1.

We present a few of the large number of interesting optimization problems that are part of the culture of calculus. The basis for solving these problems is the following de\u00afnition and theorem.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 352 De\u00afnition 8.2.1 Suppose fis a function with domain, D, and cis a number inD. 1. The point ( c; f(c)), is a maximum forfmeans that for all xinD f (x)\u00b7f(c) 2. The point ( c; f(c)) is a local maximum forfmeans that there is an open interval ( p; q) that contains cand for all numbers xinDand p; q) f(x)\u00b7f(c) 3. The point ( c; f(c)) is an interior local maximum forfifDcontains an open interval ( p; q) that contains cand for all numbers xin (p; q) f(x)\u00b7f(c) 4. Similar de\u00afnitions are made for minima . In Figure 8.4, the point B is a maximum for the graph and an interior maximum. The points A and C are local minima for the graph; A is an endpoint local minimum and C is an interior local minimum. The point D is an interior local maximum and E is an endpoint minimum. AB CD E Figure 8.4: Maxima and minima. A is an endpoint local minimum, B is an interior maximum, C is an interior local minimum, D is an interior local maximum, E is an endpoint minimum. If (c; f(c)) is a maximum for fthen we may say that fattains its maximum value at c, or the maximum value of foccurs at c, or that the maximum value of fisf(c). Thus, the sine function attains its maximum value at\u00bc 2and the maximum value of the sine function is 1. Also the sine function attains its minimum value at3\u00bc 2and the minimum value of the sine function is -1. The function f(t) =t3does not have a maximum value and does not have a minimum value. The word, `value', is often omitted inCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 353 p c qb bm < 0m > 0 ( ) Figure 8.5: A local maximum and left and right secants. these statements, and we may say, for example, that 1 is the maximum of the sine function and f(t) =t3 has neither a maximum nor a minimum. Similar language is used with local and interior local maxima and minima. Theorem 8.2.1 If (c; f(c)) is an interior local maximum for a function, f, and iff0(c) exists, then f0(c) = 0 : (Equivalently, if the graph of fhas a tangent at an interior local maximum (c; f(c)), then that tangent is horizontal.) Proof. Suppose ( c; f(c)) is an interior local maximum for f, and ( p; q) is an interval in D containing cfor which f(x)\u00b7f(c) for all xin (p; q). We wish to show that f0(c) = 0. See Figure 8.5. Suppose p < b < c . Then b\u00a1c <0, and because cis a local maximum f(b)\u00b7f(c) and f(b)\u00a1f(c)\u00b70 andf(b)\u00a1f(c) b\u00a1c\u00b80 It follows that f0\u00a1(c) = lim b!c\u00a1f(b)\u00a1f(c) Similar analysis shows that f0+(c) = lim b!c+f(b)\u00a1f(c) b\u00a1c\u00b70: It follows that f0(c) = 0. End of Proof.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 354 Summary: Critical Points. Ifcis a local maximum or local minimum for a function, f, de\u00afned on an interval [ a; b] then 1.f0(c) = 0, or 2.f0(c) does not exist, or 3.cis either aorb. The collection of all points csatisfying either 1, 2, or 3 is called the Critical Points forfon [a; b]. In the examples considered in this book, there are usually only a few (no more than \u00afve, say) critical points. Then \u00afnding the maximum and minimum values only involves selecting from among no more than \u00afve values of f. Example 8.2.1 Suppose you are going to make a rectangular box with open top from a 3 meter by 4 meter sheet of tin. One procedure for doing so would be to cut squares of side xfrom each corner as shown in Figure 8.6A, and to fold the 'tabs' up. Four pieces of area x2would be discarded. What value ofxwill maximize the volume of the box you construct in this way? What will be the volume of the largest such box?

No such points. Vis a cubic function and has derivatives at every point. \u00b2End points. The end points are x= 0 and x=3 2 The three critical values of xare 0,1 2and3 2 Find the maximum V: The maximum volume is 3 and occurs with x=1 2. In the preceding Example, we were given a surface area and asked to \u00afnd the dimensions that will maximize the volume. A dual problem is to be given a required volume, \u00afnd the dimensions that will minimize the required surface area. Example 8.2.2 Suppose a box with a square base and closed top and bottom is to have 8 cubic meters. What dimensions of the box will minimize the surface area of the box? Solution. Letxbe the length of one side of the square base and ybe the height of the box. Then the volume and surface area of the box are V=x2y S = 2x2+ 4xy Because Vis speci\u00afed to be 8 cubic meters 8 =x2y so that y=8 x2 We substitute8 4x8 x2= 2x2+32 xCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 356 Figure for Example 8.2.2.2 A.

Then and S0(x) = 0 yields 4x\u00a132x\u00a12= 0 ; 4x3\u00a132 = 0 ; x = 2 Thus we conclude that the base of the box should be 2 by 2 and because x2y= 8 the height yof the box should also be 2. Examination of the graph of S(x) = 2 x2+32xin Example Figure 8.2.2.2B suggests it is a minimum (and not, for example, a maximum!). 8.2.1 The Second Derivative Test. There is a clever way of distinguishing local maxima from local minima using the second derivative. The following theorem is proved in Section 9.2. Theorem 9.2.3 . Suppose fis a function with continuous \u00afrst and second derivatives throughout an interval [ a; b] and cis a number between aandbfor which f0(c) = 0. Under these conditions: 1. If f00(c)>0 then cis a local minimum for f(see Figure 8.7A). 2. If f00(c)<0 then cis a local maximum for f(see Figure 8.7B).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 357 A f < 0 f = 0f > 0f > 0 B f > 0f = 0 f < 0 f < 0 Figure 8.7: A. An interior local minimum, f00(c)>0. B. An interior local maximum, f00(c)<0. In Example 8.2.2, = 0, and S00(2) = 12 >0, so by the second derivative test, x= 2 is a local minimum for S, as we previously concluded. Example 8.2.3 The salmon and tuna cans shown in Example Figure 8.2.3.3 both contain \u00afsh. Why are they shaped so di\u00aeerently? Suppose the criterion for making cans is to minimize the amount of metal required to hold a \u00afxed amount of \u00afsh (the cans shown are 14.5 oz and 16 oz; we did not \u00afnd cans holding equal weights of \u00afsh). Which can most closely meets the criterion? Figure for Example 8.2.3.3 A. Salmon and tuna cans. Question: Of all cans of volume equal to 1, which has the smallest surface area? Assume that the 'can' (cylinder) in Example Figure 8.2.3.3 has volume equal to 1. The area of the top end of the can is \u00bcr2and the circumference of the top lid is 2 \u00bcr. The volume, V, of the can is V=\u00bcr2\u00a3h and the surface area, S, of the can is S= 2\u00bcr2+ 2\u00bcr\u00a3hCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 358 Figure for Example 8.2.3.3 A.

From the graph of Sin Figure 8.2.3.3B it appears that there is a single minimum at about r= 0:5.

There are some procedures we have been using that will help you solve these problems. They are listed in rough order of use and applied to an example.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 359 A 1 B x yA 1 x/2 Figure 8.8: A. A semicircle of radius 1 with inscribed rectangle. B.

It is usually easy to draw a graph of your function on a calculator and the graph will often reveal the maximum and minimum points. You may end the process at this step with a calculator based estimate of the answer. A graph of A=xq 1\u00a1x2=4 appears in Figure 8.9. The TI-86 shows the maximum to be at x= 1:41421347.

A2(0) = 0, A2(p 2) = 1, A2(2) = 0. At this stage we know that x=p 2 maximizes A2(x) because the maximum has to occur at one of the critical points.

A spear, arrow, bullet, rock or other projectile launched toward the image of the \u00afsh that you see will pass above the \u00afsh. The di\u00aeerent speeds of light in air and in water cause the light beam traveling from the \u00afsh to your eye to bend at the surface of the lake. The apparent location of the \u00afsh is marked as a dotted \u00afsh in Figure 8.2.4.4. Figure for Example 8.2.4.4 A. Light ray from \u00afsh to observer. The dotted \u00afsh is the apparent location of the \u00afsh. 1 2 Pierre Fermat asserted in 1662 that the path of the light beam will be that path that minimizes the total time of travel in the two media. The speed of light in water, v2, is about 0.75 times the speed of light in air, v1. Suppose dis the horizontal distance between your eye and the \u00afsh, h1is the height of your eye above the water and h2is the depth of the \u00afsh below the surface of the lake. Finally let xbe the horizontal distance between your eye and the point at which the beam passes through the surface of the lake. Figure for Example 8.2.4.4 B.

Instead we compute T0directly and v2 Figure for Example 8.2.4.4 Transit time for a light ray from \u00afsh to observer for parameter values v1= 1,v2= 0:75,d= 10 meters, h1= 2 meters, h2= 3 meters.

There is a single value of xwhere the graphs of sin\u00b51 v1andsin\u00b52 v2 cross and at that point T0= 0 and sin\u00b51 v1=sin\u00b52 v2(8.4) Equation 8.4 is referred to as Snell's law and applies to many problems of optics. Because for water and air, v2= 0.75 v1, and we would have \u00b52 which implies that the light ray bends down into the water as shown, and the \u00afsh is actually below its apparent position.

Diatoms are phytoplankton that originated some 200 million years ago and are found in marine, fresh water and moist terrestrial environments, and contribute some 45 percent of the oceans organic production. The shells of the diatoms illustrated are like pill boxes (a cylindrical cup caps another cylindrical cup and a 'girdle' surrounds the overlap of the shells) and some parts are permeable and other parts appear to be impermeable. (Other diatoms have quite di\u00aeerent structures, oblong and pennate, for example.) Typically the structure of such shells optimize some aspect of the organism, subject to functional constraints. Make measurements of the diatoms and discuss the optimality of the use of materials to make the shell, with the constraint that light must penetrate the shell.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 365 Figure for Exercise 8.2.5 Electron micrographs of diatoms for Exercise 8.2.5.

Light from the mountain top strikes the lake and is re\u00b0ected back to your eye, the path followed, by Fermat's hypothesis, being that path that takes the least time. Show that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of re\u00b0ection. That is, show that the angle the beam from the mountain top to the point of re\u00b0ection on the lake makes with the horizontal surface of the lake (the angle of incidence) is equal to the angle the beam from the point of re\u00b0ection to your eye makes with the horizontal surface of the lake (the angle of re\u00b0ection).

Exercise 8.2.25 A tepee is to be covered with 30 bu\u00aealo skins. What should be the angle at the base of the tepee that will maximize the volume inside the tepee? Note: The volume of a right circular cone with base radius rand height his\u00bcr2h=3 and its lateral surface area is \u00bcrp r2+h2. Exercise 8.2.26 A very challenging exercise. A tepee is to be covered with 30 bu\u00aealo skins. The skins are a little longer than the height of the Indians that will be inside and not quite as wide as the height of the Indians. Thus the areas of the skins are approximately the square of the height of the Indians. The Indians wish to maximize the area inside the teepee in which they can walk standing upright. What angle at the base of the teepee will maximize that area? 8.3 Life Sciences Optima Natural selection constantly optimizes life forms for reproductive success. Consequently, optima are endemic in living organisms and groups of organisms, but they are typically di\u00b1cult to describe and analyze and vary with the organism. Biology optima are never as simple as the geometry problems of the previous sections, such as, \"What is the size of the largest cube that can \u00aft in a sphere?\" An otherwise square cell con\u00afned to live in a sphere is very likely to become a sphere. Typically the optimum is a balance between opposing requirements as in the simpli\u00afed model1of cell size included here. A few such problems are supplied for your analysis. Example 8.3.1 Mathematical Model 8.3.1 Consider a bacterium that grows as a sphere, such as streptococcus . Its reproductive success is proportional to the energy that it produces. 1.Energy production is proportional to cell volume which provides space for processing and storage of nutrients. 1A much more satisfactory model and analysis is presented in Kohei Yoshiyama and Christopher A. Klausmeier, Optimal cell size for resource uptake in \u00b0uids: A new facet of resource competition. American Naturalist 171 (2008), pp. 59-79Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 368 2.Energy production is proportional to the concentration of nutrients inside the cell, which in turn is proportional to the ratio of the surface area of the cell to the volume of the cell. If we concentrate only on component 1, we might write Energy Production1=A V where Ais a positive constant. Energy Production 1will be large if Vis large and streptococcus cell size should increase without bound. If we concentrate only on component 2, we might write Energy Production2=B0S V=B1 3p V where Bis a positive constant (for streptococcus cells which grow in the shape of a sphere, S=3p 36\u00bcV2=3). Energy Production 2will be large if Vis small and streptococcus cell size should decrease { to zero with no nutrient processing organs! Large cells have large capacity for energy production, but are ine\u00b1cient because of low nutrient concentration. Small cells have high nutrient concentration, but may have limited capacity to use the nutrients. Caution: Smoke and mirrors ahead. How do we combine the two expressions of Energy Production? We choose the harmonic mean of the two. The harmonic mean of nnumbers fa1; a2;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2; an(8.5) Explore 8.3.1 The harmonic mean is useful for combining rates. Suppose you travel from city Ato city Bat rate rmph and travel from Bback to Aat a rate smph. Show that the rate of the round trip is the harmonic mean of rands. Now lets write the harmonic mean of the two Energy Productions as Energy Production =2 1 A V+1 B=V1=3=2A V B=V1=3 A V+B =V1=3 For illustration purposes, 1 and examine the function H(V) =2V V\u00a11=3 V+V\u00a11=3: Shown in Figure y= 2V,y= 2V\u00a11=3andH. When V\u00bf1,V\u00a11=3\u00c0Vand the denominator is \u00bcV\u00a11=3and cancels the factor V\u00a11=3in the numerator. Consequently, when V\u00bf1, H(V)\u00bc2Vand close to zero. Similarly, when V\u00c01,H(V)\u00bcV\u00a11=3and is close to zero. There is an intermediate value of Vfor which His maximum. You are asked to \u00afnd that value in Exercise 8.3.1. We have shown that the competing requirements of large capacity and high nutrient concentrations can be balanced to achieve an intermediate optimum cell size. We are ignorant of the values of AandB and have selected the harmonic mean only as a reasonably unbiased means of combining the two functions.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 369 Figure for Example 8.3.1.1 Graphs of y= 2V,y= 2V\u00a11=3andH(V) = 2 V V\u00a11=3=(V+V\u00a11=3).

Exercise 8.3.2 Theisland body size rule states that when an ecosystem becomes isolated on an island, say by rising sea levels, the species of large body size tend to evolve to a smaller body size, and species of small body size tend to increase in size. Craig McClain et al2found a similar contrast in the sea between shallow water where nutrient levels are high and deep water (depth greater than 200 meters) where nutrient levels are low. Gastropod genera that have large shallow-water species tend to have smaller deep-water representatives; those that have small shallow water species tend to have larger deep-water species. Suppose the ratio of nutrient conversion to body size vsbody size is similar to the graph in Figure 8.3.2 and that at high nutrient concentrations, nutrient conversion is not the limiting factor | predation and mate \u00afnding, for example, may be more important. Suppose further that a low nutrient concentrations, nutrient conversion becomes more important. How is the graph consistent with the observed di\u00aeerences in body size? Figure for Exercise 8.3.2 Hypothetical graph of the ratio of nutrient production to gastropod body sizevsbody size. 2Craig R. McClain, Alison G. Boyer and Gary Rosenberg, The island rule and the evolution of body size in the deep sea, Journal of Biogeography 33 (2008), pp 1578-1584.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 370 Gastropod SizeNutrient Conversion / Body Size Exercise 8.3.3 Sickle cell anemia is an inherited blood disease in which the body makes sickle-shaped red blood cells. It is caused by a single mutation from glutamic acid to valine at position 6 in the protein Hemoglobin B. The gene for hemoglobin B is on human chromosome 11; a single nucleotide change in the codon for the glutamic acid, GAG, to GTG causes the change to valine. The location of a genetic variation is called a locus and the di\u00aeerent genetic values (GAG and GTG) at the location are called alleles . People who have GAG on one copy of chromosome 11 and GTG on the other copy do not have sickle cell anemia and have elevated resistance to malaria over those who have GAG on both copies of chromosome 11. Those who have GTG on both copies of chromosome 11 have sickle cell anemia { the hydrophobic valine allows aggregation of hemoglobin molecules within the blood cell causing a sickle-like deformation that does not move easily through blood vessels. LetAdenote presence of GAG and adenote presence of GTG on chromosome 11 and let AA,Aa andaadenote the various presences of those codons on the two chromosomes of a person (either egg or adult), referred to as the genotype of the person (note: Aa=aA). It is necessary to assume non-overlapping generations , meaning that all are born and grow to sexual maturity, mate, leave o\u00aespring and die. Let pandqdenote the frequencies of Aanda, respectively in a breeding population and P,Q andRdenote the frequencies of AA,Aaandaagenotypes in the same population. As an example, in a mating of AAwith Aaadults, the chromosome in the fertilized egg (zygote) obtained from AAmust be Aand the with probability 1/2 the chromosome obtained from Aawill be Aand with probability 1/2 will be a. Therefore, the zygote will be AAwith probability 1/2 and will be Aawith probability 1/2. a.Show that p=P+1 2Qandq=1 2Q+R. b.Complete the table showing probabilities of zygote type for the various mating possibilities, the frequencies of the mating possibilities, and the zygote genotype frequencies. Include zeros with the zygote type probabilities but omit the zeros in the zygote genotype frequencies. Random mating assumes that the selection of mating partners is independent of the genotypes of the partners.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 371 Adult Zygote types Random Zygote Genotype Male \u00a3Female and probabilities mating frequencies frequency AA Aa aa AA Aa aa AA \u00a3 AA 1 0 0 P2P2 AA \u00a3 Aa 1/2 1/2 0 PQ1 2PQ1 2PQ AA \u00a3 aa 0 1 0 PR \u00a3 AA Aa \u00a3 1 \u00a7 AA \u00a7Aa \u00a7aa c.When the table is aa=q2 This means that under the random mating hypothesis, the zygote genotype frequencies are determined by the allele frequencies of the adults. This is referred to as the Hardy-Weinberg theorem. If the probability of an egg growing to adult and contributing to the next generation of eggs is the same for all eggs, independent of genotype, then the allele frequencies are constant after the \u00afrst generation. Random mating does not imply the promiscuity that might be imagined. It means that the selection of mating partner is independent of the genotype of the partner. In the United States, blood type would be a random mating locus; seldom does a United States young person inquire about the blood type of an attractive partner. In Japan, however, this seems to be a big deal, to the point that dating services arranging matches to also match blood type. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of a young person would seem to be fairly neutral; few people even know their MHC type. It has been demonstrated, however, that young women are repulsed by the smell of men of the same MHC type as their own.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 372 d.Suppose that because of malaria, an AAtype egg, either male or female, has probability 0.8 of reaching maturity and mating and because of sickle cell anemia an aatype has only 0.2 probability of mating, but that an Aatype has 1.0 probability of mating. Then the distribution of genotypes in the egg and the mating populations will be Genotype AA Aa aa Egg p22pq Find the frequency of Ain the adult population. Note: This will also be the frequency of Ain the next egg population. e.Fis called the \u00aftness of the population and because p+q= 1 F=F(p) = 0 :8p2+ 2p(1\u00a1p) + 0:2(1\u00a1p)2 You will be asked in Exercise 11.4.4 to show that during succeeding generations, allele frequency, p, moves toward the value pthat maximizes F. Find the value ^ pofpthat maximizes F(p). f.Show that if the frequency of Ain an egg generation is ^ p, then the frequency of Ain the next egg generation will also be ^ p. Exercise 8.3.4 Consider two alleles Aandaat a locus of a random mating population and the fractions of AA,Aaandaazygotes that reach maturity and mate are in the ratio 1 + s1: 1 : 1 + s2where s1ands2can be positive, negative, or zero. The \u00aftness function is F(p) = (1 + s1)p2+ 2pq+ (1 + s2)q2= (1 + s1)p2+ 2p(1\u00a1p) + (1 + s2)(1\u00a1p)2 where pandqare the frequencies Aandaamong the zygotes. a.Sketch graphs of Fand \u00afnd the values ^ pofpin [0,1] for which a maximum 0 \u00b7s1=(s1+s2)\u00b71, then the value ^ pofpin [0,1] for which F(p) is a maximum is s1=(s1+s2).

Why is it that both males and females are retained in the natural population?Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 373 8.4 Related Rates Typical Problem and Solution: Air is pumped into a spherical balloon at the rate of 6 liters per minute. At what rate is the radius of the balloon expanding when the volume of the balloon is 36 liters? Two variables , volume Vand radius r,are intrinsically re- by the relation V=4 3\u00bcr3: r One variable ( V) is changing with time. The other variable ( r) must also change. Almost always the chain rule is used. V0(t) =4 3\u00bch (r(t))3i0=4 3\u00bc3 (r(t))2r0(t) = 4 For all time, V0= 6 liters/minute = 6000 cm3/min. At the given instant ,V= 36 liters = and from 36000 =4 3\u00bcr3we get compute r0=10 123p\u00bc:= 0:57cm min: The solutions to all of the problems of this section follow the pattern of the solution just illustrated. In each of the problems, there are two or more variables intrinsically related (by one or more equations); the variables are changing with time; at a given instant, values of some of the variables and some of the rates of change are given and the problem is to evaluate the remaining variables and rates of change. Some more examples follow. Example 8.4.1 A 10 meter ladder leans against a wall. The foot of the ladder slips horizontally at the rate of 1 meter per minute. At what rate does the top of the ladder descend when the top is 6 meters from the ground?Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 374 Draw a picture. See Figure 8.4.1.1. Let xbe the distance from the wall to the foot of the ladder and let ybe the distance from the ground to the top of the ladder. We are asked to \u00afnd y0at a certain instant. Because the top of the ladder is descending, we expect our answer ( y0) to be negative. x and y are intrinsically related. x2+y2= 102 Figure for Example 8.4.1.1 Ladder leaning against a wall and sliding down respect to t(use the chain + 2y(t)y0(t) = 0 'When' The instant, t0, speci\u00afed in the problem is de\u00afned by y= 6. At that instant x2+ 62= 102, so thatx= 8. The problem also speci\u00afes x0(t) = 1 for all t. The actual value of t0is not required; we know thatx(t0) = 8, y(t0) = 6, and x0(t0) = 1. Therefore (2\u00a38\u00a31) + (2 \u00a36\u00a3y0) = 0 and y0=\u00a14 3meter/min Example 8.4.2 In an solution H+and OH\u00a1ions satisfy [H+] [OH\u00a1] = 10\u00a114 If in a certain lake the pH is 6 ([H+]=10\u00a16) and is decreasing at the rate of 0.1 pH units per year, at what rate is the hydroxyl concentration, [OH\u00a1], increasing? Solution: It is useful to take the log10of the two sides of the previous equation: log10([H+] [OH\u00a1]) = log1010\u00a114 log10[H+] + log10[OH\u00a1] = \u00a114Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 375 pH + log10[OH\u00a1] = \u00a114 pH +ln [OH\u00a1] ln [10\u00a16] 8.4.3 In Exercise 7.3.7 we discussed the following problem. A piston is linked by a 20 cm tie rod to a crank shaft which has a 5 cm radius of motion (see Figure 8.4.3.3). Let x(t) be the distance from the rotation center of the crank shaft to the end of the tie rod and \u00b5(t) be the rotation angle of the crank shaft, measured from the line through the centers of the crank shaft and piston. The crank shaft is rotating at 100 revolutions per minute. The goal is to locate the point of the cylinder at which the piston speed is the greatest. We present an analysis of this problem that illustrates some common steps in such problems. Figure for Example 8.4.3.3 Crank shaft, tie rod, and piston (or \u00b0y Step 1. We rescale the problem by dividing dimensions by 5. We are more accurate manipulating 1 and 5 than manipulating 4 and 20. Thus the parenthetical entries (1), (4), and ( y(t) =x(t)=5) in Figure 8.4.3.3. Observe that 3 \u00b7y\u00b75.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 376 By the Law of Cosines, 42= 12+y2(t)\u00a12\u00a31\u00a3y(t)\u00a3cos\u00b5(t): (8.6) Di\u00aeerentiation of this equation yields cos\u00b5(t)\u00a12y(t)(\u00a1sin\u00b5(t))\u00b50(t) y0(t) \u00b50(t)=y0(t) From Equation 8.6 cos\u00b5=y2\u00a115 Equation 8.7 to write y0(t) in terms of y(t), and Now to \u00afnd the value of yfor which y0is maximum, we might wish to compute [ y0]0=d(y0) dyand \u00afnd where it is zero. Computation of [ y0]0from the previous equation appears to be messy. Step 2. Instead we note that where y0is a maximum, [ y0]2is also a maximum and You should check the previous computation.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 377 Step 3. We need to know the value of yfor which z0= 0. That will only occur when y= 0 (outside of 3\u00b7y\u00b75) and when the numerator, y6+ 45y4\u00a11245y2+ 3375 = 0. It is helpful that the denominator is never zero. So solve y6+ 45y4\u00a11245y2+ 3375 = 0 Clever Step 4. Only even powers of yoccur in this sixth degree polynomial. Let w=y2and solve w3+ 45w2\u00a11245w+ 3375 = 0 Just as the roots to a quadratic equation are given by the formula\u00a1b\u00a7p b2\u00a14zc 2a, there are formulas for the roots to cubics, but they are seldom useful. Instead we use a polynomial solver on a calculator and compute the w3= 3:07628 The root w2= We remember compute y=p 16:88784 = 4 :10948 x= 5y= 5\u00a34:10948 = 20 :55 From the dimensions of the crank shaft and tie rod, xis between 15 and 25. The highest speed of the piston occurs at x = 20.55, to the right of midpoint of its motion.

It is unfortunately frequent to encounter simple equations such as xe\u00a1x=afor which no amount of algebraic manipulation yields a solution such as x= an expression in a. Three numerical schemes are commonly used to solve speci\u00afc instances of such equations: iteration, the bisection method, and Newton's method. Example 8.5.1 Problem. Solve xe\u00a1x=afora= 0:2 and a= 2. Solution. Graphs help explore the problem. Shown in Figure 8.10A is a graph of y=xe\u00a1x. It is apparent that the highest point of the graph has y-coordinate about y= 0:37. We are relieved of solving xe\u00a1x= 2; there is no solution. The dashed line at y= 0:2 does intersect the graph of y=xe\u00a1x; at two points so there are two solutions to xe\u00a1x= 0:2,r1at about x= 0:3 and r2at about x= 2:5.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 379 A 0 1 2 3 400.10.20.30.4y = x ex xr1r2 B 0 1 2 3 40.20.100.10.2f(x) = x e x 0.2 xr1r2 Figure 8.10: A.

There is a simple scheme that sometimes works. xe\u00a1x= 0:2 is equivalent to x= 0:2ex. We can guess x0= 0:3 as an estimate of r1, and compute a to places, x= 0:2592 is a solution to xe\u00a1x= 0:2. This scheme fails for \u00afnding the rootr2near x= 2:5 and an alternate scheme is suggested in Exercise 8.5.1. Conditions for iteration to succeed are given in Theorem 11.4.1. Another approach. It is common to modify the problem and examine the function, f(x) =x\u00a3e\u00a1x\u00a10:2 the graph of which is shown in Figure 8.11B. We are searching for points where the graph of fcrosses thex-axis (that is, f(x) = 0). Bisection. A rather plodding, but sure way to \u00afnd r1is called the bisection method . We observe from Figure 8.11A that r1appears to be between 0.2 and 0.3. We check f(0:2) = :2\u00a3e\u00a1:2\u00a1:2 =\u00a10:03625 and f(0:3) = :3\u00a3e\u00a1:3\u00a1:2 = 0 :22245Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 380 Because f(0:2) is negative and f(0:3) is positive, we think fshould be zero somewhere between 0.2 and 0.3. Next we check the value of fat the midpoint of [0.2, 0.3] and f(0:25) = \u00a10:0052998 Because f(0:25) is negative and f(0:3) is positive, we think fshould be zero somewhere between 0.25 and 0.3. Now we check the value of fat the midpoint of [0.25, 0.3] and f(0:275) = 0 :0088823 Because f(0:25) is negative and f(0:275) is positive, we think fshould be zero somewhere between 0.25 and 0.275. Obviously this can be continued as long as one has patience, and the interval containing the root decreases in length by a factor of 0.5 each step. Computation of seven decimal places in r1= 0:2591711 requires 0:1\u00a30:5n<0:5\u00a310\u00a18 which implies that n >24:25 or 25 steps. Newton's Method. It may not be a surprise to \u00afnd that Isaac Newton, in the days of quill and parchment and look up table for exponential and trigonometric functions, developed a very e\u00b1cient method for \u00afnding roots to equations. We suppose, as before, that a function, f, is de\u00afned on an interval, [ a; b], that for some number, r, in [a; b]f(r) = 0, and we are to compute an approximate value ofr. It is also necessary to know the derivative, f0off(which Newton was also good at). Newton began with an approximate value x0tor. Then he found the equation of the tangent to the graph of fat the point, ( x0; f(x0)). He reasoned that the tangent was close to the graph of fand should cross the horizontal axis at a number, x1, close to r, where the graph of fcrosses the axis. x1is easy to compute, and is an approximate value to r. Newton repeated the process as necessary, but we will see that not many repetitions are required. 0 rx0x1( x0, f(x0) ) Diagram of Newton's root \u00afnding method.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 381 An equation of the tangent to the graph of fat the point ( x0; f(x0)) is y\u00a1f(x0) x\u00a1x0=f0(x0)Equation of axis at ( x1;0). x1\u00a1x0=f0(x0) We solve for x1and \u00afnd x1=x0\u00a1f(x0) f0(x0) If we repeat this process, \u00afnd a next approximation, x2tor, where of the computations is shown in Table 8.1. The remarkable thing is that after only four iterations, we obtain 11 digit accuracy. It is typical that the number of correct digits doubles on each step (underlined digits). By contrast, the bisection gets one new correct digit in roughly three steps. The bisection method requires 38 steps for comparable accuracy. It would not have escaped Newton that the iteration xn+1=xn\u00a1xn\u00a3e\u00a1xn\u00a10:2 e\u00a1xn\u00a1xn\u00a3e\u00a1xn can be simpli\u00afed to xn+1=xn\u00a1xn\u00a10:2exn 1\u00a1xn The 12 digits shown appear a bit tedious, but your calculator makes it easy. Newton's method is a simple iteration and can be computed using the previous answer key, ANS, on your calculator. Keystrokes for the simpli\u00afed form and results are shown in Table 8.1.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 382 Table 8.1: Calculator keystrokes to compute Newton iterates to solve xe\u00a1x\u00a10:2 = 0.

First it requires the derivative of f, but there is an alternate method that uses an average rate of change rather than the rate of change and works almost as well. Secondly, a good approximation to the root is required, and there is no substitute for that. Finally, in order to eliminate some unpleasant pathology, it is su\u00b1cient to assume that f,f0 andf00are continuous and that\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00aff(s)\u00a3f00(s) (f0(s))2\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af<1 These conditions are often met.

The sei whale (pronounced `say') is a well studied example of over exploitation of a natural resource. Because they were fast swimmers, not often found near shore, and usually sank when killed, they were not hunted until modern methods of hunting and processing at sea were developed. Reasonably accurate records of sei whale harvest have been kept. \" \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2sei whale catches increased rapidly in the late 1950s and early 1960s (Mizroch et al., 1984c). The catch peaked in 1964 at over 20,000 sei whales, but by 1976 this number dropped to below 2,000 and the species received IWC protection in 1977.\" http://spo.nwr.noaa.gov/mfr611/mfr6116.pdf Data shown in Figure 8.13 are from Joseph Horwood, The Sei Whale: Population Biology, Ecology & Management, Croom Helm, London, 1987. The International Convention for Regulating Whaling was convened in 1946 and gradually became a force so that by 1963/64 e\u00aeective limits on catches of blue and \u00afn whales were in place because of depletion of those populations. As is apparent from the data, whalers turned to the sei whale in 1964-65, catching 22,205 southern hemisphere sei whales. Catches declined in the years 1965-1979 despite continued e\u00aeort to harvest them, indicating depletion of the southern hemisphere stock. A moratorium on sei whale harvest was established in 1979. The Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is an important concept in population biology, being an amount that can be harvested without eliminating the population.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 384 1920 1940 1960 1980010,00020,000 YearSei Whale Harvest, Southern Hemisphere Figure 8.13: Harvest of Sei whales, southern hemisphere, 1910 - 1979. Explore 8.6.1 Would you estimate that the southern hemisphere sei whale would sustain a harvest of 6000 whales per year? The actual size of a whale population is di\u00b1cult to measure. A standard technique is the `Mark and Recapture Method', in which a number, N, of the whales is marked at a certain time, and during a subsequent time interval the number mof marked whales among a total of Mwhales sited is recorded. Exercise 8.6.1 Suppose 100 \u00afsh in a lake are caught, marked, and returned to the lake. Suppose that ten days later 100 \u00afsh are caught, among which 5 were marked. How many \u00afsh would you estimate were in the lake? Another method to estimate population size is the `Catch per Unit E\u00aeort Method', based on the number of whale caught per day of hunting. As the population decreases, the catch per day of hunting decreases. In the Report of the International Whaling Commission (1978) , J. R. Beddington refers to the following model of Sei whale populations. Nt+1= 0:94Nt+Nt\u00a18\" 0:06 + 0 :0567( 1\u00a1\u00b5Nt\u00a18 N\u00a4\u00b62:39)# \u00a10:94Ct (8.8) Nt,Nt+1andNt\u00a18represent the adult female whale population subjected to whale harvesting in years t, t+ 1, and t\u00a18, respectively. Ctis the number of female whales harvested in year t. There is an assumption that whales become subject to harvesting the same year that they reach sexual maturity and are able to reproduce, at eight years of age. The whales of age less than 8 years are not included in Nt. N\u00a4is the number of female whales that the environment would support with no harvesting taking place. Exercise 8.6.2 Show that if there is no harvest ( Ct= 0) and both NtandNt\u00a18are equal to N\u00a4then Nt+1=N\u00a4.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 385 If we divide all terms of Equation 8.8 by N\u00a4, we get 1\u00a1D2:39 t\u00a18oi is simpler by one parameter ( N\u00a4) than Equation 8.8 and yet illustrates the same dynamical properties. Rather than use new variables, it is customary to simply rewrite Equation 8.8 with new interpretations of NtandCtand obtain Nt+1= a fraction of N\u00a4, the number supported without harvest, and Ctis a fraction of N\u00a4that is harvested. Equation 8.8 says that the population in year t+ 1 is a\u00aeected by three things: the number of female whales in the previous year ( Nt), the \\recruitment\" of eight year old female whales into the population subject to harvest, and the harvest during the previous year ( Ct). Exercise 8.6.3 a.Suppose N\u00a4= 250 ;000 and a quota of 500 female whales harvested each year is established. Change both Equations 8.8 and 8.10 to re\u00b0ect these parameter values. b.Suppose 2% of the adult female whale population is harvested each year. Change both Equations 8.8 and 8.10 to re\u00b0ect this procedure. c.What is the meaning of 0.94 at the two places it enters Equation 8.10? The term Nt\u00a18h 0:06 + 0 :0567n 1\u00a1(Nt\u00a18)2:39oi represents the number of eight year old females recruited into the adult population in year, t. The factor, h 0:06 + 0 :0567n 1\u00a1(Nt\u00a18)2:39oi represents the fecundity of the females in year t\u00a18. It has been observed that as whale numbers decrease, the fecundity increases. This term was empirically determined by Beddington. Exercise 8.6.4 Draw the graph of fecundity vsNt\u00a18. Exercise 8.6.5 Suppose harvest level, Ctis set at a constant level, Cfor a number of years. Then the whale population should reach an equilibrium level, Ne, and approximately Nt+1=Nt=Nt\u00a18=Ne We would like to have Neas a function of the harvest level, C. This is a little messy (actually quite a bit messy), but it is rather easy to write the inverse function, Cas a function of Ne.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 386 a.LetCt=CandNt+1=Nt=Nt\u00a18=Nein Equation 8.10 and solve the resulting equation for C.

What do you suppose happens if the constant harvest level is set to C= 0:03? e.N\u00a4for the southern hemisphere sei whale has been estimated to be 250,000. If N\u00a4is 250,000, what is the maximum harvest that will lead to equilibrium? Ans: 6376.75. This suggests that the maximum supportable yield of the southern hemisphere sei whale is about 6000 whales per year. Exercise 8.6.6 In this problem, you will gain some experience with the solution to Equation 8.10 for several values of the parameters by computing the solutions on your calculator.

We have introduced the concepts of di\u00aeerence quotient of a function and rate of change of a function, and applied the concepts to polynomial, exponential and logarithm functions and trigonometric functions. The di\u00aeerence quotient of a function is: Di\u00aeerence quotient of Pon [a; b] =P(b)\u00a1P(a) b\u00a1a where P is a function whose domain contains at least the numbers aandb. To compute the rate of change of Pat a number ain the domain of P, we compute the di\u00aeerence quotient of Pover intervals, [ a; b], having aas one endpoint and decreasing in size to zero. Then there is that mysterious step of deciding what those di\u00aeerence quotients get close to as bgets close to a. Assuming the di\u00aeerence quotients get close to some number, that number is called the rate of change of Pataand is denoted by P0(a). The symbol, P0, denotes the function de\u00afned by P0(a) = the rate of change of Pata for every number ain the domain for which the rate of change exists. The words `get close to' are sometimes replaced with `approaches', and the word `limit' is used for the number that ( P(b)\u00a1P(a))=(b\u00a1a) gets close to. This can reduce a lot of words to a simple symbol, P0(a) = lim b!aP(b)\u00a1P(a) b\u00a1a(8.11) Chapter Exercise 8.1 LetP(t) =p tandabe a positive number.

Using the de\u00afnition of rate of change, we obtained formulas for derivatives of six functions. Primary Formulas [C]0= 0 (8.14) [tc]0=c tc\u00a11(8.15) h eti0=et(8.16)[lnt]0=1 t(8.17) [sint]0= cos t (8.18) [cost]0=\u00a1sint (8.19) Then we obtained rules for derivatives of combinations of functions. Combination Rules [C\u00a3u(t)]0=C\u00a3u0(t) (8.20) (8.24) Formula 8.24, ([ G(u(t))]0=G0(u(t))\u00a3u0(t), called the chain rule) is a bit di\u00b1cult for students, and special cases were presented. Chain Rule Special Cases [(u(t) )n]0=n(u(t) )n\u00a11\u00a3u0(t) )\u00a3u0(t) (8.29) One special case of the chain rule is so important to the biological sciences that it requires individual attention. h ekti0=ekt\u00a3k (8.30)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 390 Example 8.8.1 Usually more than one derivative formula may be used in a single step toward computing a derivative. It is important to know which steps are being used, and a slow but sure way to insure proper use is to use but a single formula for each step. We illustrate with P(t) =h et2\u00a3(2t) + cos t\u00b4 Equation 8.18. Observe that the last two steps involved primary formulas, which is common.

With only one exception, the existence of a tangent to the graph of Pat (a; P(a)) is equivalent to the existence of the rate of change of P(t) ata. The exception is illustrated by Chapter Exercise 8.9 LetP(t) =t1 3. a.Draw the graph of Pon\u00a11\u00b7t\u00b71.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 391 b.Draw the tangent the ( P(b)\u00a1P(a))=(b\u00a1a). d.Discuss lim b!0(P(b)\u00a1P(a))=(b\u00a1a). Chapter Exercise 8.10 Find an equation of the line tangent to the graph of P(t) =etat the point (1; e1) = (1 ; e). The tangent line lies close to the graph near the point of tangency, and is often used as an easily computable approximation to the graph. The next problem illustrates this.

Water is released from the lake at the rate of 20 acre-feet per day and the volume of the lake at the time of the rain was 400 acre-feet. Flood stage is 450 acre-feet. a.Write an equation for the volume, V(t) of water in the lake at time tdays after the rain, accounting for the initial volume, the volume accumulated due to the rain, and the total volume released during the tdays. b.Does the lake \u00b0ood? c.At what time does the lake reach its maximum volume and what is the maximum volume?Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 393 Chapter Exercise 8.16 This exercise explores the optimum clutch size for a bird. Most biological parameters are compromise values that optimize some feature of the system. In this model, we assert that clutch size of birds is adapted to maximize the number of birds that survive for three months past hatching. The data is for a chickadee, Parus major , as observed in woods near Oxford, England3. This is part of a historic study of the chickadee population in those woods begun in 1947 and from which data are still being gathered. Only two of the several factors in\u00b0uencing clutch size are considered here, the weight, WTof the young at age 15 days in a clutch of size n, and the percent of \u00b0edglings recovered 3 months past \u00b0edging. The data is for the year 1961. In order to have several young survive to age three months, a large clutch should be produced. However, if the clutch is too large the adults can not adequately feed the young, they are small at \u00b0edging, and the probability of survival is reduced. The following exercises explore the relations between the parameters. The basic data is displayed in Chapter Exercise Figure 8.16 along with the following parabolas that approximate the data: WT =\u00a10:024(BD\u00a13:25)2+ 19:2 (8.31) PCT = 0:75(W\u00a115)2(8.32) WTis the average weight at 15 days of chicks in a clutch of size BD, and PCT is the percent of chicks of weight Wat 15 days that survive to 90 days.

From table 14 of Perrins, 383 broods had an average brood size of 8.1 chicks.Chapter 9 The Mean Value Theorem and Taylor Polynomials. Where are we going? The graph of the function, f, has a tan- gent that is parallel to the secant line AB. The Mean Value Theorem is a careful statement supporting this assertion and is at the heart of a surprising number of ex- planations about functions, including, for example, the second derivative tests for maxima and minima.

Suppose fis a function on a closed interval [ a; b] and 1.fis continuous on the interval, [ a; b]. 2.f0(x) exists for every number a < x < b . Then there is a number, c, with a < c < b such that f0(c) =f(b)\u00a1f(a) b\u00a1a(9.1) Explore 9.1.1 Do this. Locate (approximately) a point on each graph in Explore Figure 9.1.1A and B at which the tangent is parallel to the secant.

It is surprisingly useful, despite there being uncertainty about the number casserted to exist. Uncertainty: Suppose a motorist travels on a turnpike which is 150 miles between the entry and exit, and the ticket records that it was 1:20 pm on entry and 3:20 pm on exit. The operator at the exit observes that the motorist was speeding, and the motorist protests that he never exceeded the 70 mph speed limit. The operator looks the car over and responds, \\I see no evidence of possible discontinuous motion (as might occur in extra-terrestrial vehicles) and I am certain that at some time during your trip you were traveling 75 mph.\" His reasoning is that the average speed was 75 mph so there must have been an instant at which the speed was 75 mph. He cannot say exactly when that speed was attained, only that it occurred between 1:20 and 3:20 pm. Example 9.1.1 In special cases, we can actually \u00afnd the value of c.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 397 The Mean Value Theorem asserts that there is a tangent to the parabola y2=xthat is parallel to the secant containing (0,0) and (1,1). Let f(x) =px 0\u00b7x\u00b71: See Example Figure Figure Example A. Graph of f(x) =pxand the secant through (0,0) and (1,1) B. The tangent at (1/4, 1/2) is parallel to the secant. A 0 0.5 100.51 (0,0)(1,1) B 0 0.5 100.51 (0,0)(1,1) (1/4,1/2) The function, at (0,0) and f0(0) is not de\u00afned. Even so, the hypothesis of the Mean Value Theorem is satis\u00afed; the requirement is that f0(x) exist for 0 < x < 1 { only required for points between 0 and 1. We seek a tangent parallel to the secant through (0,0) and (1,1); the secant has slope f(1)\u00a1f(0) 1\u00a10= 1, so we look for a tangent of slope 1. The Mean Value Theorem asserts that there is a number csuch that f0(c) = 1. We solve for cin f0(c) = 11 11 2=pc 4\u00b6 =1 2 The tangent to fat (1/4, 1/2) has slope 1 and is parallel to the secant from (0,0) to (1,1) (Example Figure 9.1.0.2B.) We will \u00afnd good uses for the Mean Value Theorem in the next section. First, though, we tend to its proof. The strategy is to prove a special case where f(a) =f(b) = 0, called Rolle's Theorem, published by the French mathematician Michel Rolle in 1691. Then a proof of the general theorem is easy. In Theorem 8.2.1 on page 353 we showed that for an interior local maximum, ( c; f(c)), if the graph c; f(c)) then that tangent is horizontal. The same assertion applies to interior local minima. See Figure 9.1Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 398 Figure 9.1: The tangents to interior local minimum and maxima are horizontal. Theorem 9.1.2 Rolle's Theorem. If a function, f, [ a; every number c,a < c b . then there is a number cbetween aandbfor which f0(c) = 0. The proof is seemingly harmless. We are looking for a horizontal tangent and therefore only have to look at a high point ( u; f(u)) and [a; b]. Ifa < u , as in Figure 9.2, then ( u; f(u)) is an interior local maximum and the tangent at (u; f(u)) is horizontal. Choose c=u. Then f0(c) = 0. (a,f(a)) (b,f(b))(u,f(u)) Figure 9.2: Graph with interior maximum (and endpoint minimum). Similarly, if a < v < b , (v; f(v)) is an interior local minimum, the tangent ( v; f(v)) is horizontal. Choose c=v. Then f0(c) = 0. Ifuandvare both end points of [ a; b] (meaning uisaorbandvisaorb) then for xin [a; the largest value of least value of f(x) isf(a) =f(b) soCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 399 the only value of f(x) isf(a) =f(b). See Figure 9.3. Thus the graph of fis a horizontal interval and every tangent is horizontal. For the conclusion of the theorem we can choose cany point between aandb andf0(c) = 0. u = a v = av = b c Figure 9.3: Graph with endpoint minimum, and endpoint maximum. uandvmay be the same endpoint or at opposite ends of [ a; b]. A weakness in the preceding discussion is the presumption that the graph of f has a highest point. Under the assumptions of Theorem 9.1.2, fis continuous at every number in [ a; b], and there is a theorem that the graphs of such functions have high points (and low points). We ask you to accept the following theorem as true. Theorem 9.1.3 High Point Theorem. Iffis a continuous function de- \u00afned on a closed interval, [ a; b], then there is a number cin [a; b] such that for allxin [a; b],f(x)\u00b7f(c). We ask that you accept the High Point Theorem as true without proof. It is interesting that the High Point Theorem may be used as an alternative to the Completion Property as an axiom of the number system (see Exercise 9.1.8). With the High Point Theorem accepted as true, the proof of Rolle's Theorem is complete. End of Proof. Example 9.1.1 The function, f, de\u00afned by f(x) =( 0 for x= 0 1 xfor 0 < x\u00b71 is de\u00afned on [0,1] but does not have a highest point; nor is fcontinuous. See Figure 9.4 Example 9.1.2 Rolle's Theorem is useful in showing some functions are invertible. Let Fbe the function de\u00afned by F(x) =x+x3for all numbers, x. We will show that no horizontal line intersects the graph of Fat two distinct points, which means that Fis invertible. Observe that F0(x) = [x+x3]0= 1 + 3 x2>0 for all x. By Rolle's Theorem, if some horizontal line contains two points of the graph of Fthen at an intervening point there is a horizontal tangent and at that point F0= 0. This is impossible because F0(x) = 1 + 3 x2>0 for all x. Thus Fis an invertible function.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 400 0 0.5 1050100 Figure 9.4: The graph of f(0) = 0, f(x) = 1 =xfor 0; x\u00b71. Proof of the Mean Value Theorem.

Complete the proof of Theorem 9.1.4: Theorem 9.1.4 If the usual properties of addition, multiplication and order of the number system are assumed, one may accept the statement of the High Point Theorem as an axiom and prove the statement of the Completion Axiom as a theorem. Proof. Assume the usual properties of addition, multiplication, and order of the number system and the statement of the High Point Theorem. Suppose the statement of the Completion Axiom is not true. Then there are sets of numbers, S1andS2such that every number is in either S1orS2and every number ofS1is less than every number in S2andS1does not have a largest number and S2does not have a least number.

End of Proof.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 404 9.2 Nondecreasing and increasing functions; second derivative test for high points. With the Mean Value Theorem we can easily prove three results left from Sections 8.1 and 8.2.1. In Section 8.1 we stated that we would prove: Theorem 9.2.1 Suppose Pis a continuous function de\u00afned on an interval [d; e] and at every point tin (d; e)P0(t) exists and P0(t)\u00b80. Then Pis nondecreasing on [ Proof . Suppose aandbare numbers in [ d; e] and a < b . Then by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a number, c, between aandbsuch that P(b)\u00a1P(a) b\u00a1a=P0(c) so that P(b)\u00a1P(a) =P0(c)(b\u00a1a) By hypothesis, P0(c)\u00b80. Also a < b so that b\u00a1a >0. It follows that P(b)\u00a1P(a)\u00b80, so that P(a)\u00b7P(b). Therefore Pis nondecreasing on [ e; f]. End of proof. We also stated in Section 8.1 that we would prove: Theorem 9.2.2 Suppose Pis a continuous function de\u00afned on an interval [d; e] and at every point tin (d; e)P0(t) exists and P0(t)>0. Then Pis increasing on [ d; e]. Proof: The argument is the similar to that for Theorem 8.1.1 and is left as Exercise 9.2.3 Example 9.2.1 Theorems 9.2.1 and 9.2.2 can be used in the following way. Problem. LetP(x) = 3 x4\u00a120x3\u00a16x2+ 60x\u00a137. On what intervals is Pincreasing? On what intervals isPdecreasing? Solution. We compute P0(x) = 12 x3\u00a160x2\u00a112x+ 60 = 12( x3\u00a15x2\u00a1x+ 5) = 12( x+ 1)( x\u00a11)(x\u00a15) Confession. P(x), was selected so that the cubic, P0(x), would factor nicely. Now P0(\u00a11) = P0(1) = P0(5) = 0 which suggests that -1, 1, and 5 might be x-coordinates of local maxima and minima. We form a chart:Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 405 (\u00a1)(\u00a1)(\u00a1) (+)( \u00a1)(\u00a1) (+))(+)( \u00a1) P0<0 P0>0 The chart means that for x <\u00a11 the three factors in P0= 12( x+ 1)( x\u00a11)(x\u00a15) are all negative so thatP0is negative for all x <\u00a11. This means that Pis decreasing through out ( \u00a11;\u00a11). By similar reasoning, Pis increasing on ( \u00a11;1), decreasing on (1 ;5) and increasing on (5 ;1). We evaluate Pat three (critical) points. P(\u00a11) = 3( \u00a11)4\u00a120(\u00a11)3\u00a16(\u00a11)2+ 60(\u00a11)\u00a137 =\u00a180 P(1) = 0 P(5) = \u00a1512 These three points are plotted on the graph in Figure 9.2.0.2 and arrows indicate the increasing and decreasing character of Pbetween the data points. A candidate for the graph of Pcould be drawn with just this information. In fact, the dashed line in Figure 9.2.0.2 is the graph of P Figure for Example 9.2.0.2 The points (-1,-80), (1,0), and (5,-512) are plotted with arrows showing the increasing and decreasing character of P(x) = 3 x4\u00a120x3\u00a16x2+ 60x\u00a137 on the intervals between the data points.

In Section 8.2.1 we stated the second derivative test:Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 406 Theorem 9.2.3 Suppose fis a function with continuous \u00afrst and second derivatives throughout an interval [ a; b] and cis a number between aandbfor which f0(c) = 0. Under these conditions: 1. If f00(c)>0 then cis a local minimum for f. 2. If f00(c)<0 then cis a local maximum for f. Proof. We prove case 1, for cto be a local minimum of f. It will be helpful to look at the numbers on the number lines shown in Figure 9.5. Because f00is continuous and positive at c, there is an interval, (u; v), containing cso that f00is positive throughout ( u; v)1. See the top number line in Figure 9.5. Suppose xis in ( u; v) (the second number line in Figure 9.5). We must show that f(c)\u00b7f(x). We consider the case x < c . j j j u c v j j j j u x c v j j j j j u x c 1 c v j j j j j j u x c 1 c2 c v Figure 9.5: Number lines for the argument to Theorem 9.2.3. By the Mean Value Theorem, there is xandcfor which f(c)\u00a1f(x) that f(c)\u00a1f(x) =f0(c1)(c\u00a1x) (9.4) See the third number line in Figure 9.5. Watch this! By the Mean Value Theorem applied to the function f0and its derivative f00, there Locally Positive Theorem 4.1.1 of Exercise 4.1.13.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 407 See the bottom number line in Figure 9.5. Remember that f0(c) = 0 so from the last equation (Equation 9.5) f0(c1) =\u00a1f00(c2)(c\u00a1c1) and from this and Equation 9.4 we get f(c)\u00a1f(x) =\u00a1f00(c2)(c\u00a1c1)(c\u00a1x) Now c > x andc > c 1so that c\u00a1xandc\u00a1c1are positive. Furthermore, f00(c2)>0 because f00is positive throughout ( u; v). It follows that f(c)\u00a1f(x) is negative, and that f(c)< f(x). The event c < x is similar. The argument for Case 2. of Theorem 9.2.3 is similar. End of proof. Exercises for Section 9.2, Nondecreasing and increasing functions; second derivative test for high points.

Three Questions. 1. Pat is looking for Mike. Sean tells Pat that three minutes ago he saw Mike at the corner of First and Main. Where should Pat go to \u00afnd Mike? 2. Pat is looking for Mike. Sean tells Pat that three minutes ago he saw Mike at the corner of First and Main and he was jogging North on Main at the rate of 2 blocks per minute. Where should Pat go to \u00afnd Mike? 3. Pat is looking for Mike. Sean tells Pat that three minutes ago he saw Mike at the corner of First and Main and he was jogging North on Main at the rate of 2 blocks per minute, but Mike looked like he was getting tired. Where should Pat go to \u00afnd Mike? The \u00afrst two questions above have reasonably defensible answers, and you likely worked them out as you read them. 1.If Pat only knows that Mike was at First and Main three minutes ago, it seems the best he could do is to go to First and Main and look for Mike. 2.If in addition, Pat knows that Mike was jogging North at 2 blocks per minute, Pat should look for Mike 6 blocks north of First and Main, which we will take to be Seventh and Main. This assumes that Mike's jogging remains constant, and that he is not, for example, running laps around the court house at First and Main. 3.If it looked like Mike was getting tired, we are not sure, but Mike might also be slowing down. Perhaps Pat should look for Mike at about Fifth or Sixth and Main. The question hinges on how rapidly Mike was slowing down as a result of being tired. Of course there might be other useful information. For example, Mike might be eating a quick energy bar and regaining some of his strength! To make the questions more speci\u00afc we pose the following similar questions. 1.Suppose fis a function and f(0) = 1. Ten points of your next examination depends on your estimate of f(3). What is your best estimate?Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 409 2.Suppose fis a function and f(0) = 1 and f0(0) = 2 What is your best estimate of f(3)? (Another 10 points.) 3.Suppose fis a function and f(0) = 1 and f0(0) = 2 and f00(0) =\u00a11 4 What is your best estimate of f(3)? (Good for 15 points.) (Note: The condition, f00(0) =\u00a11 4or f00(0) negative implies that f0(t) is decreasing (Pat is slowing down).) Again the \u00afrst two questions have fairly defensible answers, and we wish to develop a rational approach to the third question, 1.Knowing only that f(0) = 1 our best guess of f(3) is also 1. Without knowledge of how fmay change in [0,3], our guess is that it does not change, and for all tbetween 0 and 3 our guess of f(t) is 1. 2.If we know that f(0) = 1 and f0(0) = 2, clearly the value of fis increasing, but we assume that f0(t) is unchanging from f0(0) (no reason to suppose that it is either higher or lower). If so, then the graph of fis a straight line, L(t), between 1 and 3 and L(t) = 1 + 2 \u00a3t so that L(3) = 1 + 2 \u00a33 = 7 : Note that the straight line f(t) = 1 + 2 tis perhaps the simplest function we can \u00afnd for which f(0) = 1 and f0(0) = 2. 3.Now suppose that f(0) = 1 and f0(0) = 2 and f00(0) =\u00a11 4 We assume that f00(t) =\u00a11 4for all 0\u00b7t\u00b73, and our strategy is to \u00afnd the most simple function, f, with these properties. We choose polynomials as `simple' and in particular look for a parabola, p(t) =a0+a1t+a2t2 with the stated properties. We need to decide what to choose for a0,a1anda2. In order to match the information about fwe will insist that p(0) = 1 and p0(0) = 2 and p00(0) =\u00a11 4 It is easy, as the array in Table 9.1 shows.

The procedure we introduced in the previous section, Section 9.3, extends to polynomials of all degrees. It is remarkably accurate when used to approximate functions. We use it to \u00afnd a cubic polynomial that approximates sin xclose to the central point, c= 0. To do so, we let f(x) = sin xand compute f(0), f0(0),f00(0), and f000(0). Then we seek a cubic polynomial p(x) =a0+a1x+a2x2+a3x3 that matches these values, meaning that = f0(0) p00(0) = f00(0) p000(0) = f000(0) The information is organized in Table 9.2.

The following di\u00aeerential equations appear in the biological literature and in this section we compute polynomial approximations to their solutions. a: solutions to di\u00aeerential equations and we illustrate this for some simple equations for which you either already know or soon will know exact solutions. Example 9.5.1 Problem : Find a polynomial, p(t) =a0+a1t+a2t2+a3t3+a4t4that approximates the solution to y0(t) =y(t); y (0) = 1 : Solution : We need to \u00afnd a0,a1,a2,a3, and a4. We will insist that ' = y0(0) = 00(t) =y0(t); and y00(0) = y0(0) y00(t) = y0(t) y(3)(t) = y(4)(0) p(4)(0) = y(4)(0);Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 You know from Chapter 5 that y=etsolves y0(t) =y(t),y(0) = 1. The polynomial that we have found is the polynomial approximation to etthat you (may have) found in Exercise 9.4.3. Furthermore, we are usually interested in y0(t) =ky(t); y(0) = y0 or y0(t) =y0e\u00a1kt kt+1 2(kt)2+1 3!(kt)3+1 4!(kt)4 approximates the solution and P(t) =p(\u00a1kt) = 1\u00a1kt+1 2(kt)2\u00a11 3!(kt)3+1 4!(kt)4 approximates the 9.5.2 Problem : Find a polynomial, p(t) =a0+a1t+a2t2+a3t3+a4t4that approximates the solution to y00(t) +y(t) = 0 ; y (0) = 1 ; y0(0) = 0 : (9.7) Solution : We need to \u00afnd a0,a1,a2,a3, and a4. We will insist that ' = are and y0(0) = 0.

Problem : Find a polynomial, p(t) =a0+a1t+a2t2+a3t3+a4t4+a5t5that approximates the solution to the logistic equation y0(t) =y(t)(1\u00a1y(t)); y (0) = 1 =2: (9.8) Solution : As in Examples 9.5.1 and 9.5.2 we will match derivatives at t= 0 to \u00afnd the coe\u00b1cients of is y(t) =et=(1 +et) and graphs of yandpare shown in Figure 9.5.3.3. Equation 9.8 is an equation for logistic growth with the initial population size equal to one-half the maximum supportable population (equal to 1), and (0,1/2) is an in\u00b0ection point of the curve. Polynomials do not have horizontal asymptotes and must eventually increase without bound or decrease without bound.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 419 Figure for Example 9.5.3.3 Graphs 2 30.500.511.5 (0,1/2) TimeLogistic and polynomial Exercises for Section 9.5, Polynomial approximation to solutions of di\u00aeerential equations.

All of the polynomials approximations we have found so far have matched data at the central point, c= 0. If we wish to \u00afnd a polynomial approximation to f(x) = ln x, because ln 0 is not de\u00afned, we will have to choose a central point other than c= 0. We can choose c= 1 as our central point, and as before, look for p(x) =a0+a1x+a2x2that matches f(x) = ln xat the central point, c= 1, as follows. Analysis f Analysis of p(x) =a0+a1x+a2x2Match p(k)(0) =f(k)(0) f(x) solve a equations, a0+a1+a2= 0 a0+ 2 + ( 2 2a2=\u00a11 a2=\u00a11 2a2=\u00a11 2 They are easy to from the `bottom up'. That is, \u00afnd a2=\u00a11 2from the last equation. Substitute \u00a11 2fora2in the second equation and compute a1= 2. Then use these two values in the \u00afrst equation to solve a1=3 2 Now our quadratic polynomial is p(x) =\u00a13 2+ 2x\u00a11 2x2(9.9) and it can be seen in Figure 9.7 that it gives a fair \u00aft on the interval \u00a11 2\u00b7x\u00b71 2. Without showing the arithmetic, we claim that the cubic that matches f(x) = ln xat 3x3: (9.10) that the terms of the cubic in Equation 9.10 have no obvious relation to the terms of the quadratic in Equation 9.9, contrary to our experience when the central point was c= 0. When the center of the data is c= 1, the polynomial form p(x) =\u00ae0+\u00ae1(x\u00a11) +\u00ae2(x\u00a11)2 is preferred for two reasons. First equations for the coe\u00b1cients each involve only one unknown coe\u00b1cient and are very easy to solve. More importantly, after a quadratic approximation has been obtained, if laterCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 421 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 11.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 221.510.500.51 Figure 9.7: (dashed line), the quadratic polynomial that matches the natural logarithm graph at the central point x= 1. we wish to compute a cubic approximation, its \u00afrst three terms are the terms of the quadratic and we only have to compute one new coe\u00b1cient. We illustrate this idea. Compute \u00ae0,\u00ae1, and \u00ae2so Analysis of f(x) = ln x f(x) = ln x f Then = 0 + 1 \u00a3(x\u00a11)\u00a11 2(x\u00a11)2 is the quadratic polynomial that matches f(x) = ln xat the central point, c= 1. This is the sameCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 422 quadratic polynomial as \u00afrst computed. is the earlier quadratic form. It is relatively easy now to compute a cubic p(x) =\u00ae0+\u00ae1(x\u00a11) +\u00ae2(x\u00a11)2+\u00ae3(x\u00a11)3 that matches f(x) = ln xat c= 1. Analysis of f(x) = ln x f(x) = ln x f p000(x) the quadratic, \u00ae0= 0,\u00ae1= 1, and \u00ae2=\u00a11 2. The only new term \u00ae3(x\u00a13)3=1 3(x\u00a13)3and the cubic is p(x) = 0 + 1 \u00a3(x\u00a11)\u00a11 2(x\u00a11)2+1 3(x\u00a11)3 General form of the coe\u00b1cients. There is a general pattern to the coe\u00b1cients for an approximating polynomial with central point cwhen the polynomial is expanded in powers of ( x\u00a1c).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 423 We treat the case of a third degree polynomial to illustrate the pattern. Assume we are given a function, f, and a number, c, and know f(c) f0(c) f(2)(c) and f(3)(c) Then p(x) =f(c) +f0(c)(x\u00a1c) +f(2)(c) 2!(x\u00a1c)2+f(3)(c) degree polynomials that match fatchave a similar form. We show the validity for the third degree polynomial. Let p(x) =\u00ae0+\u00ae1(x\u00a1c) form for the cubic approximating polynomial with central point, c, is p(x) =f(c) +f0(c)(x\u00a1c) +f00(c) 2!(x\u00a1c)2+f(3)(c) 3!(x\u00a1c)3 Lower and higher order polynomials have similar forms.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 424 Example 9.6.1 Suppose you are monitoring a rare avian population and you have the data shown. What is your best estimate for the number of adults on January 1, 2003? Adult Avian Census Jan 1, 2000 Jan 1, 2001 Jan 1, 2002 1000 1050 1080 Lettmeasure years after the year 2000, so that t= 0,t= 1, and t= 2 correspond to the years 2000, 2001, and 2002, respectively, and let A(t) denote adult avian population at time t. Our problem is to estimate A(3). Solution 1. We know A(1) = 1050. If we knew A0(1) and A00(1) we could compute the degree-2 polynomial, P(t), that matches A(t) at the central point c= 1 and use P(3) as our estimate of A(3). We use the following estimates: A0(c):=A(c+h)\u00a1A(c\u00a1h) 2hA00(c):=A(c+h)\u00a12A(c) +A(c\u00a1h) h2 where for our problem, c= 1 and h= 1. The \u00afrst estimate is what we have called the centered di\u00aeerence quotient estimate of the derivative; we call the second estimate the centered di\u00aeerence quotient estimate of the second derivative. A rationale for these two estimates appears in the discussion of Solution 2. With these estimates, we have A0(1):=A(2)\u00a1A(0) 2 =1080\u00a11000 2= 40 A00(1):=A(2)\u00a12A(1) + 1090 Our estimate of the January 1, 2003 adult population is 1090. Solution 2. We might compute the second degree polynomial, Q(t), that satis\u00afes Q(0) = A(0); Q (1) = A(1); and Q(2) = A(2): (9.11)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 425 Then Q(3) would be our estimate of the January 1, 2003 adult population. It is an interesting fact that Q(t) is the degree-2 polynomial, P(t) = 1050 + 40( t\u00a11) +1 2(\u00a120)(t\u00a11)2, that we computed in Solution 1. We can easily check this by substitution: P(0) = 1050 + \u00a3(1) +1 2(\u00a120)(1)2= 1080 There is only one quadratic polynomial satisfying the three conditions 9.11, P(t) is one such, so P(t) is Q(t). Our estimate of the January 1, 2003 adult population is again 1090. It is a general result that (c; A(c)), and matches the three data points. Furthermore, P0(c):=A(c+h)\u00a1A(c\u00a1h) 2hP00(c):=A(c+h)\u00a12A(c) +A(c\u00a1h) h2 (9.13) These results can be con\u00afrmed by substitution and di\u00aeerentiation.

The polynomials we have been studying are called Taylor polynomials after an English mathematician Brooke Taylor (1685-1731) who wrote a good expository account of them in 1715. In some texts, the polynomials for the important case where the central point is c= 0 are called McLaurin polynomials after Colin McLaurin (1698-1746), who contributed to their development. We refer to them all as Taylor polynomials. We have seen that the approximations by polynomials can be quite `good'. It is better to be able to quantify `good' and there is a theorem to The Remainder Theorem Polynomials. Suppose fis a function with continuous \u00afrst, second, third, and fourth derivatives on an interval, [a; b]. Then there are numbers states that the actual value of f(b) is the matching polynomial value, p(b), plus the remainder term that appears in bold face. There are similar formulas for higher order polynomial matches. The numbers c0,c1,c2, and c3share the mystery of the number cin Equation 9.1 of the Mean Value Theorem. In fact, you are asked in Exercise 9.7.2 to show that Equation 9.14 is the same as Equation 9.1.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 427 Lets look at the second formula, Equation 9.15, in the context of Pat looking for Mike. Suppose Mike is at First and Main, is jogging north at a constant rate of two blocks per minute. Let f(t) be the position of Mike measured in city blocks numbered First, Second, \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2, Seventh, going north. Let tbe time in minutes after Sean sees Mike at First and Main, and let a= 0 and b= 3 minutes. Because Mike's speed is constant during the three minutes, f0(t) is constant (= 2) and therefore f00(t) = 0 for all tin [0,3]. f(3) = f(0) + f0(0)(3\u00a10) +0 2!(3\u00a10) = 1 + 2(3 \u00a10) = 7 Thus Pat should look for Mike at Seventh and Main, as we thought. Now lets look at the last formula, Equation 9.17 for the case that f(x) = sin xanda= 0 and b=\u00bc 4. Remember that f(x) = sin x f (0) = 0 f0(x) = cos x f0(0) = 1 f(2)(x) = \u00a1cosx to 9.17, 4\u00a10)4: Some fuzz appears. We do not know the value of c3. We only know that it is a number between 0 and\u00bc 4. We do a worst case analysis. The largest value of sin c3forc3in [0;\u00bc 4] is for c3=\u00bc 4andCornette and 2010 428 sin\u00bc 4=p 2 2:= 0:7071. Therefore, we sin\u00bc 0:0112 We computed the actual error in Equation 9.6 and found it to be 0.0024. Therefore, our `worst case analysis' over estimated the error by0:0112 0:0024which is about a factor of 5. This is common in a robust analysis that guarantees the error is no bigger than the computed value. We will prove the second formula, Equation 9.15, in Theorem 9.7.1. You are asked to prove that the \u00afrst formula is the Mean Value Theorem in Exercise 9.7.2. It will be seen that the proof of the second formula is just an extension of the proof of the Mean Value Theorem. The remaining formulas of Theorem 9.7.1 have similar proofs. We must prove that there is a number, c1, =f(a) +f0(a)(b\u00a1a) +M 2!(b\u00a1a)2(9.18) Just solve the previous equation needed value. We let q(x) =f(a) +f0(a)(x\u00a1a) +M 2!(x\u00a1a)2(9.19) and show in Figure 9.8 a graph of fandq. You are asked in Exercise 9.7.3 to show that is shown in Figure 9.8. Now we observe that D(a) = 0 and D(b) 9.18. By Rolle's Theorem, there is a number c,a < c < b , so that D0(c) = 0. We have to compute D0.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 429 a bf(x) p2(x) (a,f(a))(b,f(b)) Figure 9.8: Graph of know that D0(c) = 0, but we next show that D0(a) = 0 also. By the previous equation, D0(a) = f0(x)\u00a10\u00a1f0(a)\u00a31\u00a1M\u00a3(x\u00a1a)jx=a =f0(a)\u00a10\u00a1f0(a)\u00a31\u00a1M\u00a3(a\u00a1a) = 0: Now, by Rolle's Theorem (again), because D0(a) = 0 and D0(c) = 0, there is a number (call it c1) such that D00(c1) = 0 We have to compute D00(x). D00(x) = [ f0(x)\u00a1f0(a)\u00a1M\u00a3(x\u00a1a)]0 = [f0(x)]0\u00a1[f0(a)]0\u00a1[M\u00a3(x\u00a1a)]0 =f00(x)\u00a1M:Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 430 D0(c1) = 0 implies that f00(c1)\u00a1M= 0 or M=f00(c1) =f(2)(c1): We substitute this value for Equation 9.18 and get f(b) =f(a) +f0(a)(b\u00a1a) +f(2)(c1) 2!(b\u00a1a)2 which Taylor's formula f(b) =f(a) +f0(a)(b\u00a1a) +f(2)(c1) 2!(b\u00a1a)2 provides a short proof of the second derivative test for a maximum: If f0(a) = 0 and f00(a)<0 then ( a; f(a)) is a local maximum for the graph of f. We suppose that f(2)is continuous so that f(2)(a)<0 implies that there is an interval, ( p; q) surrounding aso that f(2)(x)<0 for all xin (p; q). Suppose bis in ( p; q). + a negative number. Thus, ( a; f(a)) a local maximum for f. Example 9.7.2 Taylor's Theorem provides a good explanation as to why the centered di\u00aeerence quotient is usually a better approximation to f0(a) than is the forward di\u00aeerence quotient. Taylor's formula with b=a+h,b\u00a1a=his f(a+h) =f(a) h\u00a1f(2)(c1) 2!h (9.21) The equation states that f0(a) is the forward di\u00aeerence quotient plus a number times h. Taylor's formula forn= can two equations yields f(a+h)\u00a1f(a\u00a1h) = +\u00b3 f(3)(c1) +f(3)(c2)\u00b4h3 f0(a) is the centered di\u00aeerence quotient plus a number times h2. The number hused in computing di\u00aeerence quotients should be small, say 0.01, so that h2is smaller, (0.0001), suggesting that the error term in the centered di\u00aeerence quotient is smaller than the error in the forward di\u00aeerence quotient. This advantage may be nulli\u00afed, however, if f(3)(c)=6 greatly exceeds f(2)(c2)=2. Exercises for Section 9.7, The Accuracy of the Taylor Polynomial Approximations.

Where are we going? Most measurable biological quantities are dependent on more than one variable; they are functions of two or more variables. The concept of derivative of a function of one variable is extended to functions of two variables in this chapter. Conditions for local maxima and minima of functions of two variables are presented. Functions of two variables may describe di\u00aeusion of disease, invasive species, heat, or chemicals in space and time dimensions. An equation that relates partial derivatives with respect to to a space variable and with respect to time is introduced and used to quantify di\u00aeusion pro- cesses. 10.1 Partial derivatives of functions of two variables. Most measurable biological quantities are dependent on more than one variable. Corn yield is measurably dependent on rainfall, number of degree-days and available nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. Brain development in children is dependent on several nutritional factors as well as environmental factors such as rest and sociological experiences. A function of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered number pair in a set called its domain a number in a set called its range. Examples include F(x; y) =x2+y2F(x; y) =xe\u00a1y2F(x; y) = sin( x+y) F(x; y) =pxlny The domains of the \u00afrst three functions implicitly are all number pairs ( x; y). The \u00afrst function assigns number pair ( x; y) the number x2+y2; it assigns to (-2,3) the number 13, for example. The domain of F(x; y) =pxlnyimplicitly is the set of number pairs ( x; y) for which x\u00b80 and y >0. In each example, the \u00afrst variable of Fisxand the second variable of Fisy. 433Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 434 A y xz B 00.51 00.5100.4 in 3-dimensional space of A. F(x; y) = 2 and B.

F(x; y) =px2+y2. Graphs of functions of two variables can be visualized in three-dimensional space (3-space) with the domain Dlying in a horizontal x; yplane and the vertical axis being z=F(x; y). Shown in Figure 10.1A is the graph of F(x; y) = 2 which is a horizontal plane a distance 2 above the x; yplane. Shown in Figure 10.1B is a graph of the function F(x; y) =x(1\u00a1x)2+y2(1\u00a1y). Additional graphs of functions of two variables are shown in Figure 10.2. In drawing such graphs, it is customary to use a \"right-handed axis system.\" Visualize your right hand aligned so that your thumb lies on and points in the direction of the positive z-axis. Then in a right-handed system, your \u00afngers will point from the positive x-axis toCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 435 the positive y-axis. A linear function of two variables is a function of the form F(x; y) =ax+by+cwhere a,b, and c are numbers. For example, F(x; y) = 2 x+ 3y\u00a16 is a linear function and the graph of z= 2x+ 3y\u00a16 in Figure 10.3 is a plane in three-dimensional space. The portion of the graph of z= 2x+ 3y\u00a16 that lies in the plane y= 0 (marked A) is the line z= 2x\u00a16 in the x; zplane. The x; zplane is the set of all points (x;0; z) in 3-space. The portion of the graph of z= 2x+ 3y\u00a16 that lies in the plane x= 0 (marked B) is the line z= 3y\u00a16 in the y; zplane. The portion of the graph of z= 2x+ 3y\u00a16 that lies in the plane z= 0 (marked C) is the line 0 = 2 x+ 3y\u00a16 in the ( x; of the plane z= 2x+ 3y\u00a16 in three dimensional space. The line marked 'A' is the slice of that plane with y= 0. The line marked 'B' is the slice with x= 0, and the line marked 'C' is the 'level curve' with z= 0.

The partial derivative of Fwith respect to its \u00afrst variable, denoted by F1, is the ordinary derivative of Fwith re- spect to its \u00afrst variable with the second variable held constant. Similarly, the partial derivative of Fwith respect to its second variable, denoted by F2, is the ordinary derivative of Fwith respect to its second variable with the \u00afrst variable held constant. Second order derivatives are denoted by F1;1,F1;2,F2;1, and F2;2where Fi;jis the derivative of Fiwith respect to the jthvariable.

Then the local linear approximation to Fat (a,b) is the linear function L(x; y) =F(a; b) +F1(a; b)\u00a3(x\u00a1a) +F2(a; b)\u00a3(y\u00a1b) (10.2) The graph of Lis the tangent plane to the graph of Fat (a; b; F (a; b)), and F is said to be di\u00aeerentiable at ( a; b).

View is from below the graph. For functions fof one variable, the tangent line to the graph of fat (a; f(a)) is simply the line y=f(a) a tangent at ( a; f(a)), there is no requirement that f0(x) be continuous. The example, F(x; y) =q jxyj illustrates the need for conditions beyond the existence of F1(a; b) and F2(a; b) in order that there be a tangent plane at ( a; b; F (a; b)). 10.6. y) =q jxyj; F (0;0) = 0 F(x;0) = 0 ; F 1(0;0) = 0 ; F(0; y) = 0 ; F 2(0;0) = 0 : so the local linear approximation at (0,0) might be L(x; y) = 0 + 0 \u00a3(x\u00a10) + 0 \u00a3(y\u00a10) = 0 ; the graph of which is the horizontal plane z= 0. However, the slice of the graph through y=xfor which z=jxjshown in Figure 10.6B is a line that pierces the z= 0 plane at an angle of about 35 degrees. Thus over the line y=x,L(x; y) = 0 is not tangent to the graph of F. We do not accept the graph of L(x; y) as tangent to the graph of F. Also, Fis not di\u00aeerentiable at (0,0).

There is no local linear approximation to Fat (0,0) and no tangent plane to the graph of Fat (0,0,0). B. Cut away of the graph of A showing the angle between the surface and the horizontal plane above the line y=x. Property 10.1.1 A property of tangents to functions of one variable. Suppose fis a function of one variable and at a number ain its domain, f0(a) exists. The graph of L(x) =f(a) +f0(a)(x\u00a1a) is the tangent to the numerator, f(x)\u00a1L(x), injf(x)\u00a1L(x)j jx\u00a1aj'goes to zero faster' than does the denominator, jx\u00a1aj.It is this property that is the de\u00afning characteristic of 'tangent'. Only the existence of f0(a) is required. It is not required that f0(x) be continuous. As was apparent in Figure 10.5B for the function F(x; y) =q jxyj, something more than existence of F1(a; b) and F2(a; b) is required in order to have a tangent plane for F(x; y) at a point ( a; b). A su\u00b1cient condition is that F1andF2exist and be continuous on a circle with center ( a; b).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 441 Property 10.1.2 A property of local linear approximations to func- tions of two variables. Suppose Fis a function of two variables, ( a; b) is a number pair in the domain of F, and F1andF2exist and are continuous on the interior of a circle with center ( a; b).

An interior point ( a; b) of the domain of a function of two variables, F, is a critical point of Fmeans that F1(a; b) = 0 and F2(a; b) = 0 or that one of F1(a; b) orF2(a; b) fails to exist. A point of a domain is an interior point of the domain if it is the center of a circle, the interior of which lies in the domain. Else it is called a boundary point . There are four critical points of F(x; y) =x(1\u00a1x)2+y2(1\u00a1y), (1=3;2=3); (1;2=3); (1=3;0); and (1 ;0): The critical point (1/3,2/3) is discussed above and shown in Figure 10.7.

The origin, (0,0), is a critical point of each of the graphs and the z= 0 plane is the tangent plane to each of the graphs at (0,0). For F, for example, F(x; y) = x2+y2F1(x; y) = 2 x F 2(x; y) = 2 y F(0;0) = 0 F1(0;0) = 0 F2(0;0) = 0 The origin, (0,0), is a critical point of F, the linear approximation to Fat (0,0) is L(x; y) = 0, and the tangent plane is z= 0, or the x; yplane. The same is true for GandH; the tangent plane at (0,0,0) is z= 0 for all three examples. This seemingly monotonous information is saved by the observations of the relation of the tangent plane to the graphs of the three functions. For F, (0,0,0) is the lowest point of the graph of F, and for H, (0,0,0) is the highest point of the graph of H. This is similar to the horizontal lines associated with high and low points of graphs of functions of one variables. The graph of Gis di\u00aeerent. The point (0,0,0) is called a saddle point of the graph of G. The portion of Gin the x; zplane (y= 0) has a low point at (0,0,0) and the portion of Gin the y; zplane ( x= 0) has a high point at (0,0,0). For a function fof a single variable and a number afor which f0(a) = 0, there is a simple second derivative test that distinguishes whether ( a; f(a)) is a locally high point ( or a locally low point ( f00(a)>0 ). There is also a second derivative test for functions of two variables. De\u00afnition 10.2.2 De\u00afnition of Local Maxima and Minima. If ( a; b) is a point in the domain of a function Fof two variables, F(a; b) is a local maximum for Fmeans that there is a number \u00b10>0 such that if ( x; y) \u00b10then F(x; y)\u00b7F(a; b).

Suppose ( a; b) is a critical point of a function Fof two variables that has continuous \u00afrst and second partial derivatives in a circle with center at ( a; b) and b)>0 then F(a; b) is a local minimum of F. Case 2. If \u00a2 >0 and F1;1(a; b)<0 then F(a; b) is a local maximum of F. Case 3. If \u00a2 <0 then ( a; b; F (a; b)) is a saddle point of F. Case 4. If \u00a2 = 0, punt, use another supplier. We omit the proof of Theorem 10.2.1, but illustrate its application to the functions F,G, and Hof Example 10.2.1 and shown in Figure 10.10. For F(x; y) =x2+y2; F 1;1(0;0) = 2 >0;\u00a2 = 2 \u00a32\u00a10 = 4 >0; and the origin is a local minimum for F. For G(x; y) =x2\u00a1y2;\u00a2(0;0) = 2 \u00a3(\u00a12)\u00a10 =\u00a14<0; and the origin is a saddle point for G. We have not de\u00afned a saddle point. For our purposes, a saddle point is a critical point for which \u00a2 <0. For H(x; y) =\u00a1x2\u00a1y2; H 1;1(0;0) =\u00a12;\u00a2 =\u00a12\u00a3(\u00a12)\u00a10 = 4 >0; and the origin is a local maximum for H. Example 10.2.2 Least squares \u00aft of a line to data.

Assume the hemisphere is the graph of z=pR2\u00a1x2\u00a1y2and that the optimum box has one face in the x; y-plane and the other four corners on the hemisphere (see Figure 10.2.4.4).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 450 Figure for Example 10.2.4.4 A box in a sphere.

Partial derivatives may appear in equations and when they do the equations are called partial di\u00aeerential equations. This is a vast \u00afeld of study. We give one very important example, the di\u00aeusion equation, and suggest a numerical method for its solution. The di\u00aeusion equation is ut(x; t) = c2uxx(x; t); a A; and u(b; t) =B; 0< t: You may think of a brass rod of diameter, d, that is small compared to its length, L. Let u(x; t) be the temperature in the rod at position xand at time tand suppose that at time t= 0 the temperature in the rod is g(x). Alternatively, you may think of a glass tube of diameter, d, that is small compared to its length, L, and is \u00aflled with distilled water. At time t= 0 a drop of salt water is placed in one end of the rod and the salt spreads (di\u00aeuses) along the water in the rod. Let u(x; t) be the concentration of salt at position xand time t.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 455 A single equation describes u(x; t) for both of these problems and a host of other problems. Molecules di\u00aeuse in intracellular \u00b0uids; diseases di\u00aeuse in a population; an invasive species di\u00aeuses over an extended range. 'Di\u00aeuse' is also used to describe the transfer of molecules across a cellular membrane due to osmotic pressure. In this case the concentration is essentially discontinuous across the thin membrane; the problems in this section assume the concentration is continuous along an extended region. We derive the di\u00aeusion equation in terms of the di\u00aeusion of salt. Consider a circular glass rod of cross sectional area Aand length L\u00aflled with water and assume that at time t= 0 the concentration of the salt along the tube is g(x). Let u(x; t) be the salt concentration at distance xfrom one end of the rod at time t. Figure 10.11A. Assume that the diameter of the rod is small enough that the salt concentration at any position xalong the rod depends only on x. xu(x; t) 0 LA - x\u00a1kux(x; t) 0 LB - - x x\u00a1d x +d0 LC Figure 10.11: A. Glass rod, salt concentration at xat time tisu(x; t). B. The rate at which salt \u00b0ows past position xis proportional to \u00a1ux(x; t). C. The amount of salt between x\u00a1dandx+dat time tis approximately u(x; t)\u00a3A\u00a32d. Mathematical model 1. Salt tends to \u00b0ow from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration. The rate at which salt \u00b0ows past position xin the direction of increasing xat time tis proportional to \u00a1ux(x; t) and to A, the cross sectional area of the rod. Figure 10.11B. From this model we write R(x; t) =\u00a1kAu x(x; t) (10.16) where R(x; t) is the rate at which salt di\u00aeuses past position xat time tandkis a proportionality constant that is a property of the solvent.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 456 Units. The order to balance the units on Equation 10.16, the units on kmust section of the rod between x\u00a1dandx+d, Figure 10.11C. During a time interval t tot+\u00b1salt \u00b0ows past x\u00a1d, \u00b0ows past x+d, and accumulates in the section. Mathematical model 2. The amount of salt in any small region of the tube is approximately the concentration of salt at some point in the region times the volume of the region. From Mathematical Model 2 we write that the amount of salt in the section from x\u00a1dtox+dat time tis approximately u(x; t)\u00a3A\u00a32d. Mathematical model 3. During a time interval from ttot+\u00b1, the amount of salt that \u00b0ows into a region minus the amount of salt that \u00b0ows out of the region is the the accumulation within the region. Now R(x\u00a1d; t) is the rate at which salt \u00b0ows past x\u00a1din the direction of increasing x. The amount of salt that \u00b0ows into the section x\u00a1dtox+dduring the time ttot+\u00b1is approximately R(x\u00a1d; t)\u00a3\u00b1. The amount of salt that \u00b0ows out of the section during time ttot+\u00b1is approximately R(x+d; t)\u00a3\u00b1, Both rates may be negative and the actual \u00b0ows negative. The accumulation in the section during a time interval from ttot+\u00b1is approximately u(x; t+\u00b1)\u00a3A\u00a32dminus u(x; t)\u00a3A\u00a32d. xtu B 01.573.14 02400.51 space u(x; t) =e\u00a1tsinx. t):=kuxx(x; t) As\u00b1!0 and d!0, all of the errors reduce (we suppose to zero) and we write ut(x; t) =kuxx(x; t) Di\u00aeusion equation. (10.18) The proportionality constant kis positive and is usually written as c2to signal this and to simplify analytical solutions. As noted above, the units on kare cm2/sec. The size of kre\u00b0ects how rapidly the salt moves in water or the heat moves in a rod or a disease spreads in a population or generally how rapidly a substance di\u00aeuses in its medium. If kis large, u(x; t) changes rapidly; if kis small, u(x; t) changes slowly. For example, u(x; t) =e\u00a1ktsinx is a solution to Equation 10.18: ut(x; Graphs of e\u00a1tsinxande\u00a10:5tsinxappear in Figure 10.12A and B respectively. It can be seen that the graph in B with smaller kchanges more slowly than the graph in A. The initial concentration of salt in the rod is required in order to compute the concentration at later times. Assume that there is a known function gsuch that at time t= 0 the concentration at position xis g(x). Then u(x;0) = g(x) 0 < x < L Initial condition. (10.19) Finally we need some knowledge about the ends of the rod, referred to as boundary conditions . The ends may be sealed so that no salt di\u00aeuses past either end. This is expressed as ux(0; t) =ux(L; t) = 0 ; 0\u00b7t; Insulated boundary conditions. (10.20) Alternatively, we might assume the rod connects two reservoirs in which the salt concentration is constant, but there is no actual \u00b0ow of solvent through the rod. Then there will be two concentrations, C0andCL, such that u(0; t) =C0; U (L; t) =CL; 0\u00b7t Fixed boundary conditions. (10.21)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 458 Explore 10.3.1 Suppose the x= 0 end of the tube is attached to a reservoir with salt concentration c0= 1 and the x=Lend of the tube is sealed. What would be the boundary conditions? What would u(x; t) be for 'large' values of t? Equation 10.18 for which u(x; t) is concentration of salt also describes the temperature, u(x; t) in a rod of length Lthat is insulated along its sides. In this case, the initial condition g(x) would be the temperature distribution along the rod at time t= 0. The rod may also be insulated at each end and boundary condition 10.20 would apply, and this accounts for the name 'Insulated boundary condition.' Alternatively, one end of the rod may be exposed to, say, steam and the other end exposed to ice water, and boundary condition 10.21 would apply. Explore 10.3.2 Suppose on a \u00b0at sandy beach the temperature at a depth of 2 meters is constant, equal to 20\u00b1C, and the temperature at the surface of the beach is 27 + 4 sin((2 \u00bc=24)t)\u00b1C. Suppose the sand temperature varies only vertically. What equations would you like to solve if you were interested in a nest of turtle eggs buried 80 cm? There are analytical solutions to the di\u00aeusion equation 10.18 with initial condition 10.19 with either of the boundary conditions 10.20 or 10.21. Only a few of them are simple enough for our use. We describe one example and include two examples in Exercises 10.3.4 and 10.3.9. Example 10.3.1 Problem. Let u(x; t) = \u00a4(1\u00a1e\u00a1tcos\u00bc\u00a4x) ux(2; t) = 0 : (10.23) Assuming Equations 10.23 are correct, u(x; t) would describe the temperature in a rod of length 2 that is perfectly insulated along its side, had an initial temperature of 30 \u00a4(1\u00a1cos\u00bcx ) at position x, and was perfectly insulated on each end. The di\u00aeusion coe\u00b1cient of the material in the rod is k= 1=\u00bc2. Alternatively, the equations would describe the salt concentration in a tube closed at each end when the initial salt concentration at position xwas 30 \u00a4(1\u00a1cos\u00bcx ). Explore 10.3.3 What will be the 'eventual' temperature distribution (or salt concentration) in the rod (tube)?

Numerical solutions. Finding analytic solutions is beyond the scope of this text. However, a numerical scheme for approximating a solution is well within reach. Partition the tube into n intervals of length d=L=n, and partition time into intervals of length \u00b1, as shown in Figure 10.14 for n= 5 and the space time grid shown above the tube. Begin with Equation 10.18, ut(x; t) d2 :Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 460 6 6 6 6 6 grid for di\u00aeusion computation.

Equations 10.29 can be solved as is illustrated in the next example. Using this notation in Equation 10.29 and rearranging leads to vi;j+1=vi;j+^k(vi\u00a11;j\u00a12vi;j+vi+1;j) where terms of vi\u00a11;j,vi;jandvi+;j, values of vat the immediately preceding time value j. See Figure 10.15. The computation is started at time j= 0 with values of vi;0equal to values of the initial condition g(x) and progresses 'upward' in time, one layer at a time. Example 10.3.2 Assume there is a glass tube of length L= 1 meter and of cross sectional area A= 1 cm \u00aflled with water; initially there is no salt in the tube; the left end is attached to a salt water reservoirCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 461 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 u u u u titi+1 vi\u00a11;j Geometric arrangement of the grid points of Equation 10.30. with salt concentration = 1 and the right end is attached to a pure water reservoir. Let u(x; t) be the salt concentration in the tube at position xand time t. Explore 10.3.4 What do you expect the 'eventual' salt concentration along the tube to be? The di\u00aeusion equation is ut(x; t) =kuxx(x; t). Because initially there is no salt in the tube, g(x) = 0 for 0 < x < 1, and the reservoirs at the ends of the tube imply the \u00afxed boundary conditions 10.21, u(0; t) = 1 and u(1; t) = 0, 0 \u00b7t. Partition the tube into 5 equal intervals. There is in Figure 10.14 an array of points horizontally distributed with position xalong the tube and distributed vertically in time t. In this example, vi;j:=u(i\u00a31=5; j\u00a3\u00b1); i = 1;5; j = 1;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2: and from Equation 10.29 vi;j+1=vi;j+^k(vi\u00a11;j\u00a12vi;j+vi+1;j) where ^k=\u00b1\u00a3k d2: (10.31) The boundary conditions 10.21 with u(0; t) = 1 and u(1; t) = 0 lead to v0;j= 1 v5;j= 0 (10.32) The initial condition and equations 10.31 determine the vi;jone horizontal layer at a time for the interior grid points, 1 < i < 5. Begin with the initial condition, Equation 10.19: vi;0=g(xi) = 0 ; i = 1;4 (10.33)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 462 Then for the bottom layer of the grid in Figure 10.14 v0;0= 1 and vj;0= 0 j= 1;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2;5: Then compute v2;1=v2;0+^k(v1;0\u00a12v2;0+v3;0) v3;1=v3;0+^k(v2;0\u00a12v3;0+v4;0) v4;1=v4;0+^k(v3;0\u00a12v4;0+v5;0) v0;1=v1;1 v5;1=v4;1 In a similar way as many layers as necessary can be computed. The computations for ^k= 0:2 are shown in Table 10.1. Remember that ^k=\u00b1\u00a3k d2incorporates the time step, \u00b1, and dimension step, d, as well as the di\u00aeusion constant, k. These computations may be visualized as salt (blue color) migrating to the right in a tube as illustrated in the graphic below the data. There is a severe constraint on ^k=k\u00a3\u00b1 d2in order that Equations 10.30 yield values of vi;jthat reasonably approximate the target function u(x; t). We must have ^k=k\u00a3\u00b1 d2<1 2: (10.34) The consequence of ^k >1=2 is in Exercise 10.3.1b, where ^k= 0:6. In Example 10.3.2 the tube partition is d= 0:2 meters. If one wanted a smaller partition in order to more accurately approximate the salt concentration, say d= 0:01, one centimeter or 1/20th of the space step of the example, then the time step \u00b1would have to be 1 =400th of the \u00afrst time dimension. It would take 400 iterations of the resulting equations in order to move one of the original time steps. There is an interesting alternate procedure that is not so constrained that will be found in numerical analysis books. Exercises for Section 10.3, The di\u00aeusion equation.

There is an excellent di\u00aeusion simulator written by Michael Karweit of Johns Hopkins University Department of Chemical Engineering at the web site www:jhu:edu=virtlab =di\u00aeusion \u00a1processes The program simulates di\u00aeusion in two dimensions which we have not analyzed. However, on the rectangular domain you may set all parameters to be constant in the vertical direction and observe variation in the horizontal direction. It is also interesting to see two-dimensional di\u00aeusion. Run three experiments on the simulator and report the results.

Exercise 10.3.8 This exercise is worth quite a bit of your time. a.For any g(x), how much salt is in the rod (of length 1 meter and cross section 1cm2) at time t= 0? Consider some special cases such as g(x)\u00b41g/cm3andg(x) =xg/cm3. Then for general g, think, approximately how much salt is in the \u00afrst 10 cm of the rod, the second 10 cm of the rod, \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2, the last 10 cm of the rod, and add those quantities. b.For the insulated end boundary condition 10.21 and any initial condition g(x) and rod length L what is lim t!1u(x; t) ? Exercise 10.3.9 Suppose there is an in\u00afnitely long tube containing water lying along the X-axis from \u00a11to1and at time t= 0 a bolus injection of one gram of salt is made at the origin. Let u(x; t) be the concentration of salt at position xin the tube at time t. Considering t= 0 is a bit of stressful: u(x;0) = 0 for x6= 0; but the bolus injection of one gm at the origin causes the concentration at x= 0 and t= 0 to be rather large; u(0;0) =1. Moving on, for t >0 we may assume that ut(x; t) =kuxx(x; t) (10.37) where the di\u00aeusion coe\u00b1cient, k, describes the rate at which salt di\u00aeuses in water. a.Show that u(x; t) =1p 4\u00bckte\u00a1x2=(4kt)(10.38) is a solution to Equation 10.37.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 466 b.Suppose k= 1=4. the graphs of u(x;1),u(x;4), Sketch the graphs of u(x;1),u(x;1=2), and u(x;1=4). d.Estimate the areas under the previous curves.

Exercise 10.3.10 Di\u00aeusion in two dimensions is similar to that in one dimension.

Describe how you may approximate the progress of the disease as a function of time.Chapter 11 First Order Di\u00aeerence Equations Where are we going? The di\u00aeerence equation models of population growth and penicillin clear- ance introduced in Chapter 1 are re\u00afned to account for additional factors (limited population environments and continuous penicillin infusion). Formulas for solutions to linear systems are developed. Qualitative anal- ysis of nonlinear systems shows important biological and mathematical concepts of equilibrium point andasymptotically stable andun- stable equilibria. 11.1 Di\u00aeerence Equations and Solutions. The equation Initial Change per Removal Environmental condition time interval rate input P0= 0 Pt+1\u00a1Pt=\u00a10:23Pt+ 0 :5(11.1) might well represent continuous infusion of penicillin into a patient. The penicillin kinetics suggested by Equation 11.1 are that each 5 minutes, 23% of the penicillin in the serum is removed and 0.5 \u00b9gm/ml is added1. We found in Section 1.8 that the solution to the di\u00aeerence equation Pt+1\u00a1Pt=r Pt+b should doubt that removal of 23% of serum penicillin each 5 minutes is realistic, and we ask you to read the footnote on page 34. 467Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 468 Thus the response to continuous penicillin infusion, Equation 11.1, is Pt=0:5 0:23+\u00b5 0\u00a10:5 0:23\u00b6 (1\u00a10:23)t= 2:17\u00a12:17\u00a30:77t: Important to the analysis (and to the nurse) is the equilibrium state E=\u00a1b=r(= 2.17 \u00b9gm/ml). After two hours ( t= 24) the penicillin concentration will be 2.17 \u00b9gm/ml and will continue at that level. The nurse must decide whether 2.17 \u00b9gm/ml will prevent infection, or perhaps be toxic. In the Report of the International Whaling Commission (1978) , J. R. Beddington refers to the following model of Sei whale populations. Nt+1\u00a1Nt=\u00a10:06Nt+Nt\u00a18\" 0:06 + 0 :0567( 1\u00a1\u00b5Nt\u00a18 N\u00a4\u00b62:39)# \u00a10:94Ct (11.4) Nt,Nt+1andNt\u00a18represent the adult female whale population subjected to whale harvesting in years t, t+ 1, and t\u00a18, respectively. Ctis the number of female whales harvested in year t. There is an assumption that whales become subject to harvesting the same year that they reach sexual maturity and are able to reproduce, at eight years of age. The whales of age less than 8 years are not included in Nt. N\u00a4is the number of female whales that the environment would support with no harvesting taking place. Explore 11.1.1 Explain the term \u00a10:06Ntin Equation 11.4. In order to solve for progressive values of the whale population, it is necessary to know the \u00afrst nine values of Nt, fort= 0;1;2;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a28, and the number, Ct. of whales that would be caught. However, once those values are known, Ntcan be computed for any integer value of t. It is a chore to compute very many values of Ntusing only paper and pencil, but is rather easy to compute even a thousand values using a calculator program. There is no formula for the solution to the whale equation as there is in the penicillin example, however . Our method will be to give qualitative descriptions of the solutions what happens to the whale population if harvested at a certain intensity for a long period of time. These are two examples of di\u00aeerence equations with initial data . They give approximate values of the underlying real world penicillin kinetics or populations. Usually when di\u00aeerence equations arise, there is a property of the system (population, light intensity, chemical concentration, etc.) that can be measured as a quantity, Q, and one of the obvious things that one can say about Qhow the change, Qt+1\u00a1Qt, depends on time, t, or on Qt, or perhaps on other values of Qsuch as Qt\u00a18. Di\u00aeerence equations are by nature based on discrete independent variables. The discrete characteristic is natural for the whale model because of the annual breeding cycle of whales. It is a minor limitation, however for penicillin kinetics which is a continuous process, and does not proceed in \u00afve minute jumps. Division of bacteria is in fact a discrete process, but because of the large number of bacteria (of the order 108/ml) and the variety of bacterial ages in the population, the population can be better modeled with a continuous model. The following equations are, respectively, examples of \u00afrst order, second order and third order autonomous (explained below) di\u00aeerence equations with initial conditions. Q0= 4 1 Qt+1\u00a1Qt= 0:2Qt\u00a10:4Qt\u00a11Qt\u00a12Third order.(11.5)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 469 The \u00afrst order and third order equations are nonlinear because of the square root and product terms. The second order equation is linear because each term involves only one value of Qkto the \u00afrst power. All three equations are autonomous because the change, Qt+1\u00a1Qtdepends only on values of Qk. The following di\u00aeerence equation is not autonomous Qt+1\u00a1Qt=\u00a10:5Qt+ 0:5Qt\u00a11+t2 because of the term t2. The relation between Q-values changes with time. The whale Nt+1= 0:94Nt+Nt\u00a18\" 0:06 + 0 :0567( 1\u00a1\u00b5Nt\u00a18 N\u00a4\u00b62:39)# \u00a10:94Ct is not autonomous because of the term Ct, representing the catch in year twhich may change from year to year. If the catch were set to be 2 percent of the population, Ct= 0:02Nt, however, the resulting equation would be autonomous. A solution to a di\u00aeerence equation is a sequence, Q=fQ0; Q1; Q2;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2g, of numbers that satis\u00afes the initial conditions and the condition imposed by the di\u00aeerence equation. Usually one can compute at least some of the \u00afrst terms of the sequence. Consider Q0= 2 Qt+1\u00a1Qt=Qt+t First, convert to iteration form Q0= 0 Qt+1= 2\u00a3Qt+t Then t= 0 Q0+1 = 2\u00a3Q0+ 0 = 2 \u00a30 + 0 = 0 t= 1 Q1+1 = 2\u00a3Q1+ 1 = 2 \u00a30 + 1 = 1 t= 2 Q2+1 = 2\u00a3Q2+ 2 = 2 \u00a31 + 2 = 4 Additional values of Qtcan be computed as needed. Exceptions. It may happen that only a \u00afnite sequence of values may be computed from the di\u00aeerence equation or that the values computed become unrealistic (negative, for example, when the numbers in the sequence represent population size). Consider the initial condition and di\u00aeerence equation P0= 1 Pt+1\u00a1Pt=p4\u00a1Pt One can compute (using iteration form, Pt+1=Pt+p4\u00a1Pt) t= 0 and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 470 Thus P4requires the square root of a negative number and is outside our domain of real numbers. We stop with P3. Uniqueness of solutions. Di\u00aeerence equations with speci\u00afed initial conditions the form Qt+1\u00a1Qt=F(t; Q t) Q0=Qinit where Qinitis speci\u00afed have unique solutions. Because Fis a function; for pair, ( t; Q t),Fassigns a unique number, F(t; Q the pair. Once Q0is known, Q1\u00a1Q0=F(0; Q0),Q1=Q0+F(0; Q0), so that Q1is known uniquely, and the rest of the sequence is similarly determined. As has been noted, some pair ( t; Q t) may fall outside the domain of Fso that the computation terminates after a \u00afnite number of terms. The point here is that there is no ambiguity in the terms computed, they are unique. The second order di\u00aeerence equation, Q t+2=Qt+1+Qt+ 0:06Qt+1\u00a3(1\u00a1Qt) both required, but once Q0andQ1are speci\u00afed, Q2is determined. And Q3is determined by Q1andQ2. All of the terms Q2,Q3,Q4,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2are determined by Q0, Q1, and the equation conditions, Q0,Q1,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2,Qk\u00a11, are required to determine Qk,Qk+1,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2. On most calculators it is easy to compute successive iterates of an autonomous \u00afrst order recursion equation using the `Previous Answer' key, ANS. For ex- ample, to compute iterates of Q0= 0:5 Qt+1= 1:5Qt(1\u00a1Qt) (11.6) on your calculator type 0.5, ENTER, 1.5 \u00a3ANS\u00a3(1 - ANS), ENTER, ENTER, \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2 The following numbers instance ( \u00bd= 1:5) of a renown equation, Q0given ; Q t+1=\u00bd Qt(1\u00a1Qt): (11.7)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 471 which is an important introduction to the exotic subjects of chaos and fractals. We use it in examples and exercises before the thorough description in Section 11.6 of its source, the Verhulst's population growth Equation 11.29, Pt+1\u00a1Pt=R P t\u00a3\u00b5 1\u00a1Pt M\u00b6 ; where Ptis population size at time, t,Ris population growth rate in an unlimited environment, and M is the carrying capacity of the environment. The relation between the two equations is Pt+1\u00a1Pt=R P t\u00a3\u00b5 1\u00a1Pt M\u00b6 32t+2 is a formula for 1; P 1=7 3; P of claim. We must: 1.Check to see whether formula 11.8 yields P0= 1 and P1= 7=3. By the formula t= Pt=1 32t+2 and to compute Pt+2substitute t+ 2 for each tthat appears in the Di\u00aeerence Equation is satis\u00afed. To check that a proposed formula actually de\u00afnes the solution of a di\u00aeerence equation, use the two steps of the previous example. It is more di\u00b1cult to \u00afnd such a formula. You are asked to \u00afnd solutions to \u00afrst order linear di\u00aeerence equations with constant coe\u00b1cients in Exercises 11.1.15 and 11.1.16. The same procedure works for second order linear di\u00aeerence equations with constant coe\u00b1cients. Part of the procedure is illustrated by the following two examples. Problem. Find numbers pandqsuch that Pt=p+qt is a solution to Pt+2\u00a15Pt+1+ 6Pt= 2 + t Solution.

The di\u00aeerence equations for which we have found solution formulas have all been linear di\u00aeerence equations.

The sequence Gt, can involve linear and exponential terms in t, and even polynomials in t (but do not push this { solutions may be hard to write), but is independent of Pt. It is usually hard to \u00afnd formulas for solutions to nonlinear equations. There are no formulas that describe the solutions :3\u00b5 500\u00b6\u00b8 we write solutions to the nonlinear equation P0= 2 Pt+1=1:2Pt 1 +Pt=50Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 479 (This is actually a linear equation in disguise.) The previous nonlinear equations all have reasonable population model interpretations, and we look for graphical methods that will show the qualitative behavior of solutions as a good replacement for having a formula for the solution.

The alternative is that the population decreases to extinction or grows beyond environmental bounds or oscillates repeatedly, possibly without periodic rep- etition. The second question is, given that the population size is at a nonzero equilib- rium value, if the population experiences a small perturbation (by a weather change, for example), will the size return to the equilibrium value? Methods are given for answering these questions by examination of the di\u00aeer- ence equation, even without a solution to the di\u00aeerence equation. The whale equation Nt+1= 0:94Nt+Nt\u00a18\" 1\u00a1\u00b5Nt\u00a18 N\u00a4\u00b62:39)# by dividing each term by N\u00a4, the number of females that would be present without harvesting. De\u00afne Yt=Nt=N\u00a4 and Dt=Ct=N\u00a4; that Ct= 0:2N\u00a4) which means that 2% of the equilibrium in an unharvested population is harvested without regard to the present population size. Solutions to Yt+1= 0:94Yt+Yt\u00a18h 0:06 + 0 :0567n 1\u00a1Y2:39 t\u00a18oi \u00a10:94\u00a30:02 (11.14) are plotted in Figure 11.3. The harvest is set to be 0.02 (last term in the equation), which means that 2% of the equilibrium in an unharvested population is harvested without regard to the present population size. The initial conditions are set at A: 1.0, B: 0.6, and C: 0.2 of the unharvested equilibrium population. For both cases A and B it appears that the whale population is moving toward about 0.8, meaning that with harvest of 2% of the equilibrium unharvested population, the harvested population will stabilize at about 80% of the unharvested equilibrium. However, if the initial whale population is only 20% of the unharvested equilibrium population, when 2% harvest is initiated the population will disappear. In order to explore the interaction of whale growth and harvest more thoroughly we introduce a modi\u00afcation in the model and a new way of graphing the relation. First we rewrite the model to be Yt+1= 0:94Yt+Yth 0:06 + 0 :0567n 1\u00a1Y2:39 toi \u00a10:94\u00a30:02 (11.15)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 483 0 5 10 15 20 25 3000.20.40.60.81 Time YearsFraction of Sustainable Whale Population A B C Figure 11.3: Solutions to the whale equation, Equation 11.14, with harvest set at 2 percent of the equi- librium population in the absence of harvest and three sets of initial conditions, A: Yi= Yt\u00a18with Ytwhich e\u00aeectively assumes the whales reach sexual maturity in one year rather than in eight years. To compute data we need only a single initial value. A plot of the new whale numbers is shown in Figure 11.4 It can be seen that the dynamics are similar to those in the previous \u00afgure, except that the whale population in case C crashes more quickly, in about 16 years. 0 5 10 15 20 25 3000.20.40.60.81 Time YearsFraction of Sustainable Whale Population A B C Figure 11.4: Solutions to the modi\u00afed whale equation, Equation 11.15, with harvest set at 2 percent of the equilibrium population in the absence of harvest and three sets of initial conditions, A, Y0= 1:0, B, Y0= 0:6, and C, Y0= 0:2. A new way of visualizing the whale growth is to examine Yt+1as a function of Yt. Thus from Yt+1= 0:94Yt+Yth 0:06 + 0 :0567n 1\u00a1Y2:39 toi \u00a10:94\u00a30:02Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 484 we write a functional form Yt+1=F(Yt) where F(Y) = 0 :94Y+Yh 0:0567Y\u00b3 1\u00a1Y2:39\u00b4 \u00a10:0188\u00b4 (11.16) that corresponds to a model with low density birth rate and harvest \u00afve times that of the previous model. A graph of y=F(Y) is shown in Figure 11.5 together with the graph of y=x. 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 (0.364, 0.364)(0.799, 0.799) AB Year t Whale DensityYear t + 1 Whale Density y = x Figure 11.5: Graphs of Equation 11.16 and y=x. Remember that if Yis the population in year t, then y=F(Y) is the population in year t+ 1. That gives special meaning to the two points, A(0.364, 0.364) and B(0.799, 0.799), where the graph of y=F(Y) crosses the line y=x. If the population in year tis 0.364, then the population in year t+ 1 is also 0.364. By the same reason, the population in year t+ 2 is also 0.364, and according to this model, the population will stay at 0.364. Similarly, if the population is ever 0.799, by this model it will always be at 0.799. The points AandBare called equilibrium points for the iteration Yt+1=F(Yt). Alternatively, the common coordinates, 0.364 of Aand 0.799 of B, are called equilibrium values ofNt+1=F(Nt).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 485 Equilibrium points of the iteration Yt+1=F(Yt) are found by solving for Yein Ye=F(Ye) Explore 11.3.1 Do this. 0:79909107.) b.Repeat the calculation with Y0= 0:364. You should observe that the iterations drift downward from 0.364 and that Y20= 0:359. In fact, Y43is negative. c.Repeat 0:365. You should \u00afnd that Y20= 0:395. You just found that for Y0= 0:799,Ytremains close to 0.799, but for Y0= 0:364,Ytmoves away from 0.364. Neither 0.364 nor 0.799 are the exact values of the points of intersection. Closer approximations are 0.36412683047 and 0.79909120051, but neither of these is exact either. The exact values are solutions to y=x and y= 1:2835x\u00a10:2835x3:39\u00a10:094 or xe= 1:2835xe\u00a10:2835x3:39 e\u00a10:094 or 0 :2835xe\u00a10:2835x3:39 e\u00a10:094 = 0 The portions of the graph of y=F(Y) that lie below the graph of y=xare informative. Observe the point C, (0.260, 0.237) in Figure 11.6. If Yt= 0:260, then in the next generation, Yt+1= 0:237 which is less than Yt. The portions of the graph of y=F(x) below the diagonal, y=x, where F(x)< xandYt+1=F(Yt)< Y t, are associated with decreasing population numbers. Similarly, the portions of the graph of y=F(x) above the diagonal, y=x, are associated with increasing population numbers, Yt+1=F(Yt)> Y t. These properties confer quite di\u00aeerent characteristics on the two equilibrium points, AandB. Brie\u00b0y, iterates move away from athen Y1is than Y0,Y2is less than Y1, and the values Y0,Y1,Y2,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2decrease away from a. Alternatively, if Y0is slightly greater than a, then Y1is greater than Y0,Y2is greater than Y1, and the values Y0,Y1,Y2,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2increase away from a. The number, a, is said to be a nonstable equilibrium for the iteration, Yt+1=F(Yt). By similar reasoning it can be seen that for B(b; b),bis astable equilibrium for the iteration Yt+1=F(Yt). IfY0is greater than b Y0,Y1,Y2,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2decrease toward band if Y0is slightly less than b Y0, Y1,Y2,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2increase toward b.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 486 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 (0.364, 0.364)(0.799, 0.799) AB Year t Whale DensityYear t + 1 Whale Density (0.260, 0.237)C Figure 11.6: The graphs of F(Y) = 1 :2835Y\u00a10:2835Y3:39\u00a10:094 and y=x. The points AandB are equilibrium points of the iteration Yt+1=F(Yt). The point Cillustrates that if Yt= 0:260, then Yt+1= 0:237 is less than Yt. This discussion is repeated and expanded in the next section, but a formal de\u00afnition of stable and nonstable equilibrium points follows.

An equilibrium point is nonstable if it is not locally stable. To return to the original whale equation, Equation 11.14, the same analysis applies as for Equation 11.15. The di\u00aeerence is that the graph of the iteration function is hardly distinct from the graph of the diagonal, y=x, as shown in Figure 11.8. The equilibrium points are the same and have the same stability character. The case considered simply gives easier graphs to examine.

We normalize the equation by dividing by 100. is pt+1=F(pt) The graph of Fis shown in Figure 11.9, together with the graph of y=x.

Continue It is apparent that this path (called a cobweb ) is channeled between the graph of Fand the diagonal line and that it will go to the equilibrium point (0.853, 0.853). Furthermore, any path that begins with p0between 0.146 and 0.853 will lead to (0.853, 0.853).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 491 Explore 11.4.1 Start at p0= 0:95 on the horizontal axis in Figure 11.10A.

Four examples in which the function F(p) is linear will motivate our conclusion. Shown in Figure 11.11A is the graph of F(p) = 0 :7p+ 0:2, a line with slope 0.7, less than 1, and the equilibrium point at (2/3,2/3) is locally stable.

Theorem 11.4.1 IfFandF0are continuous on [0 ;1] ;1] F(pe) = pe. Then the equilibrium point peis locally stable if jF0(pe)j<1. Proof. The proof of Theorem 11.4.1 makes good use of the Mean Value Theorem on page 396. Suppose Fsatis\u00afes the hypothesis of Theorem 11.4.1. Let R= (F0(pe) + of (0,1) with midpoint pefor which jF0(x)j< R for all a < x < b (Similar to Theorem 4.1.1 in Exercise 4.1.13) the iteration sequence de\u00afned by pt+1=F(pt).

In 1798 and subsequent years, Malthus argued that The annual increase in human population is proportional to the size of the population at the beginning of the year. and The food supply increases a constant amount each year. With Ptbeing the human population in year tandFtthe available food each year, the statements lead to Pt+1\u00a1Pt=R P t where R > 1 Ft+1\u00a1Ft=G and G > 0(11.19) Malthus argued that the amount of food per person, Ft Pt!0 as t! 1 except that he believed that calamity would strike long before tgets `close to' 1. The solutions tare are shown in Figure 11.14. P0andF0are both one unit and may be considered to be the present population and the present food supply. The iteration Ptallows for 1 percent annual growth (less than present world population growth).

The problem is enormously more complex than can be described by two short tables showing population growth and food production.

We examine a di\u00aeerence equation used to describe population growth in limited environments. Pt+1\u00a1Pt=R\u00a3Pt\u00a3\u00b3 1\u00a1Pt M\u00b4 Logistic Growth An alternate equation is examined in Section 11.8 Pt+1=(1 +R)Pt 1 +RPt MAlternate Logistic Growth In 1838, Verhulst, in response to Malthus, argued that environments have a carrying capacity and as populations near their environmental limits, the growth rates decrease. Something like this is happening today in the human population. In less developed regions of the world total fertility has fallen from 6 to 3 births per woman in the past \u00affty years6. Verhulst's model of population growth was Mathematical Model of population growth in a limited environment. The annual increase in human population is proportional to the size of the population at the beginning of the year and is proportional to the fraction of the carrying capacity unused by the population. If the carrying capacity is measured as M, the number of humans the environment will support, and Ptis the population size in year tthen Pt Mis the fraction of the carrying capacity that is used, and 1\u00a1Pt Mis the unused fraction of the carrying capacity. 6www.undp.org/popinCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 505 Because of the double proportionality, the annual increase is proportional to the product of the population size and the unused carrying capacity: Pt+1\u00a1Pt=R P t\u00a3\u00b5 1\u00a1Pt M\u00b6 (11.29) Ris density growth rate . When Ptis `small' compared to M, the factor,\u00b3 1\u00a1Pt M\u00b4 is forPt M`small' AsPt!M,\u00b3 1\u00a1Pt M\u00b4 approaches 0, that the population change, Pt+1\u00a1Pt:=R\u00a3Pt\u00a30 = 0 forPt M:= 1 For reasons that are unknown to us, the word logistic is used to describe Equation 11.29. Equation 11.29 is the discrete logistic equation, and we will study the continuous logistic equation in Chapter 16. To be concrete, consider a low density growth rate, R= 0:4, and a carrying capacity, M= Pt+1\u00a1Pt= 0:4\u00a3Pt\u00a3\u00b5 1\u00a1Pt 1000\u00b6 (11.30) When 1 \u00a1Pt 1000= 0:99:= 1 and Pt+1\u00a1Pt:= 0:4\u00a3Pt\u00a31 = 0 :4\u00a3Pt The population increases approximately 40% each time period, and there is exponential growth. This growth continues until the population size compared to 1000 is signi\u00afcant. When Pt= 500, 1 \u00a1Pt 1000= 0:5 and Pt+1\u00a1Pt:= 0:4\u00a3Pt\u00a30:5 = 0 :2\u00a3Pt The population is still growing, but only at 20% per time period, one-half of that at low density. When the populations size, Ptreaches 990 (high density, almost to carrying capacity), 1\u00a1Pt 1000= 0:01 and Pt+1\u00a1Pt:= 0:4\u00a3Pt\u00a30:01 = 0 :004\u00a3Pt and the growth rate has fallen to 0.4% per time period.

Shown in the table and graph in Figure 11.16 are data from growing V. natrigens in a \u00b0ask over a two hour period. V. natrigens density is measured by Absorbance on a spectrophotometer. The \u00afrst 80 minutes of this data was shown in the discussion of exponential growth on page 5 where it was noted that the growth rate during the last 16 minutes was a bit below that of 0 to 64 minutes. The graph of V natrigens density vsTime bears a reasonable resemblance to that of the logistic curve shown in previous graphs, and we look for a logistic equation that approximates the E. coli data. The equation should be of the form Pt+1\u00a1Pt=R\u00a3Pt\u00a3\u00b5 1\u00a1Pt M\u00b6 (11.31) In order to compute with it, we must have an initial value, P0, and we need to \u00afnd R,M.

Exercise 11.6.8 Danger: This problem will almost surely fry your brain. Consider the sequence de\u00afned by, Q0= 0:2; the subsequence Q2,Q4,Q6,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2converges to 1. It certainly appears so from the data in Table 11.6.6, but even Q100;000= 1:001114938 is 0.001 above 1. Assume without proof that all of the numbers 1 < Q 2t<1:2. First you will show that Q2t+2\u00a11< Q 2t\u00a11; t = 1;2;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2: That shows that the sequence decreases toward 1, but does not prove that its limit is 1. (The sequence f2 + 1 =1;2 + 1 =2;2 + 1 =3;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a22 + 1 =n;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2gdecreases toward 1, but does not converge to 1.) You might think that jQt+1\u00a11j<jQt\u00a11j; t = 1;2;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2 but that is unfortunately false. jQ9\u00a11j= 0:01975 6<0:01903 = jQ8\u00a11j: We therefore have to iteration function F(x) =x+ 2x(1\u00a1x) = 16 x2\u00a18x+ 1 and show that (1,1) is the maximum for Hon the interval [0.5, 1.2] and that His positive on this interval. d.Show that Q2t+2\u00a11< Q 2t\u00a11 (because the second factor in Equation 11.35 is less than 1).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 513 e.We now know that fQ2; Q4Q6;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2gis a decreasing sequence of numbers bigger than 1, and, by the Axiom of Completeness 1 and Theorem 5.2.1, the sequence has a limit, Lwhich is either 1 or bigger than 1 and that Lis less than or equal to every number in fQ2; Q4Q6;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2g. f.Show that = ( Q2t\u00a11)H(Q2t)\u00b7(Q2t\u00a11)H(L) h.IfL= 1, the assertion is proved.

The population di\u00aeerence equations can be modi\u00afed to re\u00b0ect the e\u00aeects of harvest. The harvest may be measured as an amount harvested, Ht, or a fraction of the present population harvested, ht\u00a3Pt. The logistic equation questions that one asks is what harvest strategy will provide the maximum long term yield, what is the maximum allowable harvest in order to retain the population, and what are the locally stable equilibrium sizes of the population? Example 11.7.1 We begin with the equation P0= 1000 Pt+1\u00a1Pt= 0:2\u00a3Pt\u00a3\u00b5 1\u00a1Pt 1000\u00b6 \u00a1h\u00a3Pt of a population with an initial population of 1000 individuals, low density growth rate of 0.2 per time interval, carrying capacity 1000 individuals, and ask what constant fraction of individuals present, h, may be harvested and still retain the population?Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 514 The equilibrium population is important and we solve for Pein P\u00a4\u00a1Pe= 1000\u00b6 \u00a1h= 0 for which Pe= 0 and Pe= 1000 \u00a3(1\u00a15h) Observe that if 1 \u00a15his negative, the only realistic equilibrium is 0. Therefore if we harvest more than 20% ( h >0:2) of the population present at each time, we will loose the population. This makes sense. The low density growth rate (births minus natural deaths) is 20% and if harvest exceeds that we will loose the population. In fact, if harvest h= 0:2 then Pe= 1000 \u00a3(1\u00a15h) = 0, and we loose the population. We next normalize the initial equation by dividing by the carrying capacity. Pt 1000\u00a1Pt 1000= 0:2\u00a3Pt 1 Pt+1\u00a1Pt= 0:2\u00a3Pt\u00a3(1\u00a1Pt)\u00a1h\u00a3Pt Now if the fractional harvest is set at a number, h <0:2, the equilibrium is either 0 or (1\u00a15h)\u00a31000. Shown in Figure 11.19 is the graph of Pt+1vsPtforh= 0:05 and it is apparent that Pt= 0 is a nonstable equilibrium and Pt= 1\u00a15h= 0:75 is locally stable. The objective often will be to maximize harvest. At the equilibrium of Pe= 1\u00a15h, the harvest amount is h\u00a3Pe=h\u00a3(1\u00a15h). The maximum harvest at equilibrium will be obtained at a harvest level that maximizes h\u00a3(1\u00a15h). For what value of his h\u00a3(1\u00a15h) the largest? Then G00(h) Therefore h= 0:1 value of h\u00a3(1\u00a15h). Recall that R= 0:2 in this example. Then a 10% harvest strategy is one-half the low density growth rate and will yield a long term maximum harvest value. Furthermore, for R= 0:2 and h= 0:1,Pt+1 is Pe= 0:5 sothe maximum harvest occurs with the population at one-half the maximum supportable population. This is a general property of logistic models.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 515 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9100.20.40.60.81 (0.75, 0.75) PtPt+1 Figure 11.19: Graphs of the iteration equation, Pt+1=Pt+ 0:2Pt(1\u00a1Pt)\u00a10:05Ptandy=xshowing the equilibrium point at (0.75,0.75).

Exercise 11.7.3 Assume that h < R < 2. Compute F0(p) and evaluate F0(0) and F0(1\u00a1h=R). Conclude that 0 is a nonstable equilibrium and 1 \u00a1h=R is a locally stable equilibrium. Exercise 11.7.4 Assume that h < R < 2 so that 1 \u00a1h=R is a positive, locally stable equilibrium. The harvest at that equilibrium will be h\u00a3(1\u00a1h=R). Find the value of hfor which h\u00a3(1\u00a1h=R) is the largest. Conclude that in order to maximize harvest, the harvest fraction hshould be set at one-half the low density growth rate, R. Find the positive equilibrium pefor this value of h. In terms of M, what is the equilibrium value at the harvest rate that will maximize harvest?Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 516 In the next four exercises you will analyze the Equation 11.39, Pt+1\u00a1Pt=R\u00a3Pt\u00a3\u00b5 1\u00a1Pt M\u00b6 \u00a1H (11.39) where R <2 and a \u00afxed amount, H, is harvested each time period. Exercise 11.7.5 Divide the terms of Equation 11.39 by Mto obtain pt+1\u00a1pt=R\u00a3pt\u00a3(1\u00a1pt)\u00a1K (11.40) What is the interpretation of Kin this equation? Exercise 11.7.6 a.Show that the equilibrium numbers there to be any positive equilibrium, the harvest Kmust be less than or equal to one-fourth the low density growth rate R. Exercise 11.7.7 Assume that K < 4RandR <2. Compute F0(p) for F(p) =p+r\u00a3p\u00a3(1\u00a1p)\u00a1K. Show that p\u00a4;1is not stable and p\u00a4;2is locally stable. Exercise 11.7.8 The maximum harvest for pt+1\u00a1pt=R\u00a3pt\u00a3(1\u00a1pt)\u00a1Kis interesting. In order for there to be a positive equilibrium, we must have K\u00b7R=4. We might suppose K=R=4. a. Show that under the assumption that K=R=4,p\u00a41=p\u00a42= 1=2 and that F0(p\u00a42) = 1. We are then uncertain whether 1/2 is a locally stable equilibrium. Note that p\u00a42= 1=2 corresponds to one-half the maximum supportable population. b.

Cobweb the graph starting with p0>1=2 and again with the p0<1=2. Is p\u00a42= 1=2 locally stable?

The \u00afrst order di\u00aeerence equation models of bacterial growth and penicillin clearance introduced in Chapter 1 are re\u00afned to account for additional factors (multiple population categories and absorbance of penicillin into tissue) that allow more accurate matches of models to data. These and other models moti- vate systems of di\u00aeerence equations that are referred to as discrete dynamical systems. The important biological and mathematical concepts of equilibrium point and stable and unstable equilibria are extended to equilibria of discrete dynamical systems. 12.1 Infectious diseases: The SIR model. In this section you will develop a model of an infectious disease that is spread directly from human to human (in\u00b0uenza, polio, measles, for example) and that confers immunity to a person who has had the disease. It does not include diseases carried by mosquitoes or mice or other `vectors'. The model also assumes a reasonably `closed' human population in that it does not account for disease being brought into the population from people not included in it, except for the initial source of the disease. Suppose there are 25,000 students and faculty in a 'closed' university population, and that at the beginning of a semester 50 of the people return to school infected with a certain in\u00b0uenza. Assume that infected people can transmit the disease during a period of 5 days beginning with the day they are \u00afrst infected. At any time university people can be classi\u00afed as Susceptible. Those people who have not had this in\u00b0uenza and are susceptible to infection. Infectious. Those people who are infected and are contagious. Recovered. Those people who have had the \u00b0u, are recovered (no longer contagious), and are immune to the disease. 522Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 523 To understand the categories, examine Table 12.1, where it is assumed that the 50 infected people are equally distributed between being infected 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0 days before arriving on campus and 20 new cases are recorded each morning at, say, 6am. Initial days of an in\u00b0uenza outbreak. Day Susceptible Newly Infectious Newly Recovered Infected Recovered -4 10 10 -3 10 20 -2 10 30 -1 10 40 0 24950 10 50 1 24930 20 60 10 10 2 24910 20 70 10 20 3 24890 20 80 10 30 4 24870 20 5 24850 20 6 24830 20 7 24810 20 100 20 90 The assumption of a \u00afxed number (20) of new cases per day is too restrictive. As the number of infectious people increases, the disease will spread more rapidly. After a large number of people have been infected and recovered, the susceptible population is small and the spread of the disease will slow down. An elementary model of the spread of disease is: Mathematical Model 12.1.1 In\u00b0uenza transmission. In\u00b0uenza is transmitted by an `infectious contact' between an infectious individual and a susceptible individual. The frequency of such contacts is proportional to the number of infectious people and to the number of susceptible people in the population. The number of newly infected is proportional to the infectious contact frequency. The duration of the disease for all individuals is a \u00afxed time period and all people recover. As usual, for the frequency of contact to be proportional to two quantities we write that the frequency is a constant times the product of the two things: Infectious Contact Frequency = \u00af0\u00a3Number of Susceptible \u00a3Number of Infectious The number of newly infected is proportional to the infectious contact frequency and we write Number of Newly Infected = \u00af\u00a3Number of Susceptible \u00a3Number of Infectious (12.1) The number \u00afincorporates both the biological property of how easily the disease is transferred from one person to another and the sociological property of the frequency and nature of such contacts. Measles, for example, is highly contagious (a child with measles will expose his or her entire class in about 30 minutes in a class room). Measles- \u00afis `high' and is determined primarily by biologicalCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 524 properties. HIV transmission requires an exchange of body \u00b0uids; HIV- \u00afis `low' and is determined largely by sociological properties. The following notation is useful. Suppose time is measured in periods of hours, days, or weeks and t is the index of time periods. Let St= Number of susceptible people at the beginning of time period t. It= Number of infected people at the beginning of time period t. Rt=Number of people who have recovered at the beginning of time period t. Rtincludes all people who have been infected and have recovered during any previous time period. Suppose furthermore that the duration of the disease is dtime periods for all people. You are asked to write and analyze equations that model in\u00b0uenza dynamics in the following exercises. Exercises to complete the analysis of in\u00b0uenza dynamics. Exercise 12.1.1 Fill in the blanks in Table 12.1 and see that they are consistent with the last line.

Exercise 12.1.5 Suppose that the proportionality constant, \u00af= 0:00003, and that there is a reasonably closed university population of 25,000 people and that 50 return to university at the beginning of a semester infected with an in\u00b0uenza. Use Equation 12.4 to compute St,It, and Rtfort= 1;2;3. Assume that infected people remain contagious for 5 days, so that \u00b0= 1=5 = 0 :2 of the infected people recover each day.

You will show in Exercise 17.5.7 that in the continuous model analogous to Equations 12.4 it never happens that everyone gets sick.

We present here some of the data from T. Bergans, Penicillins, in Antibiotics and Chemotherapy, Vol. 25 , H. Sch\u00bfonfeld, Ed., S. Karger, Basel, New York, 1978, and suggest some of the improvements in the model of penicillin kinetics that are suggested by the data. Figure 12.1 shows simple clearance of mezlocillin from serum after intravenous administration of a 1, 2, or 5 g dose during a 5 minute period. This is referred to as a `bolus' dose, and is imagined as an instantaneous administration of the drug. We will focus attention on the 2 g data. The data appears to have been taken 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 minutes after administration was completed. The table to the right of the graphs contains numbers read from the 2 g dose graph. Explore 12.2.1 Three data points, corresponding to times t= 10, t= 60, and t= 180 minutes are omitted from the table. Read approximate values for these data from the graph of 2 g data and complete the table. Observe that the vertical scale in Figure 12.1 is measured in logarithms to the base 10 of \u00b9g/ml. It appears that at time t= 0 the data would be about 200 \u00b9g/ml. Assume a serum volume of 2.75 liters (Rhoades and Tanner, page 210, 2 :75 = 0 :55\u00a35:0). Administration of 2 gm yields an initial value of 727 \u00b9g/ml (= 2 \u00a3106=(2:75\u00a3103). However, the dose was administered over a 5 minute interval; if we assume that 4% is lost each minute, one has 644 \u00b9g/ml at the end of the administration period. This is quite high compared to the t= 0 data point which we estimated to be about 200 \u00b9g/ml. It appears that the penicillin equilibrates quickly in a pool of larger volume, possibly including the serum, the blood cells, and part of the interstitual \u00b0uid. We wish to write a mathematical model descriptive of penicillin kinetics. In Section 1.6 we suggested that penicillin clearance would be 4% per minute, or approximately 20% per \u00afve minutes. If so, by the methods of that section we would conclude that Pt= 200 \u00a30:8tand we would conclude that the graph of Ptversus twould be a straight line on semilog paper. See Exercise 12.2.2. The graphs of the observed data in Figure 12.1 are not straight lines. The departure from straight lines is due to the attachment of mezlocillin to proteins in the vascular pool and migration of mezlocillin into tissue, followed by return of the penicillin to the vascular pool. Attachment to proteins and migration to tissue both remove penicillin from the vascular pool and have similar e\u00aeects on the model, although the \u00b0ow rates will be di\u00aeerent. To simplify the model the two are combined into only migration into tissue. Schematic diagrams that enable discussion of the kinetics are commonly used to depict pharmacokinetic models.

The di\u00aeerence between one and two compartment models can be explored using some very simple concepts. Explore 12.2.2 We do not have data on the mesocilin concentration in the tissue compartment. What is the tissue concentration at time t= 0? Sketch a possible graph of that concentration. Do you expect that concentration to exceed the serum mesocilin concentration at any time? Kinetics of a one-pool model A \u00b0ask (Serum) has 5 liters of pure water and 200 grams of salt. At the end of each \u00afve minute interval, 1 liter (20%) of the liquid is removed from the \u00b0ask, after which one liter of pure water is added and the \u00b0ask is well stirred. LetPtdenote the amount of salt in the \u00b0ask at time t(at the end of the tth\u00afve minute time interval and at the beginning of the t+ 1sttime interval. We can write P0= 200 200 grams initially in the \u00b0ask. Pt+1\u00a1Pt=\u00a10:2\u00a4Pt Remove 20% each time period. Pt+1= 0:8\u00a3Pt Iteration equation. Pt= 200 \u00a30:8tSolution to the iteration equation. Kinetics of a two-pool model. An example of the two-pool model shown in Figure 12.2 is analyzed as follows. Suppose there are two \u00b0asks, \u00b0ask 1 (Serum) contains 1 liter of water and 200 milligrams of salt and \u00b0ask 2 (Tissue) contains 0.68 liters of water. (The numbers have been selected to give an answer similar to the data of Figure 12.1 and expressed in rational numbers.) At the end of each \u00afve minute interval, 68 ml of liquid is removed from \u00b0ask 2 (10%) and temporarily set aside, 68 ml of liquid is removed from \u00b0ask 1 (6.8%) and added to \u00b0ask 2 and 162 ml of liquid is removed from \u00b0ask 1 (16.2%) and discarded. Then the 68 ml removed from \u00b0ask 2 is added to \u00b0ask 1, and 162 ml of pure water is added to \u00b0ask 1.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 529 LetAtandBtdenote the amount of salt in \u00b0ask 1 and \u00b0ask 2, respectively, at the end of the tth5 minute time interval and at the beginning of the t+ 1sttime interval. The value of R1;2, for example, in the two-pool model diagram is either 68 ml per \u00afve minutes or the fractional value 0.1 (10% of the pool) per \u00afve minutes. Both forms are used in the pharmacokintics literature; we use the fractional value. The value of A0is 200 and the value of B0is 0. The changes in the amount of salt in the two \u00b0asks may be accounted for by: Change Increase Decrease At+1\u00a1At= 0 :1Bt (\u00a10:162\u00a10:068)At \u00a10:1Bt(12.5) The Bt=200 2:1\u00a3(0:68\u00a30:94t\u00a10:68\u00a30:73t)(12.7) exactly solve the Equations 12.6. Equations 12.7 are easier to use and give us a picture of the solution more quickly than the iteration Equations 12.6. You will see how Equations 12.7 are obtained in Section 12.4. We show that the \u00afrst iteration equation is satis\u00afed by the proposed solution equations and leave for you to show in Exercise 12.2.8 that the second iteration equation is satis\u00afed. First observe = 200 so that the initial value of A tis satis\u00afed . Next we substitute the two expressions for AtandBtinto the right hand side of the equation Exercises for Section 12.2, Pharmacokinetics of Penicillin Exercise 12.2.1 Assuming that immediately after a 2 gm injection of penicillin into the vascular pool, the penicillin concentration is 200 \u00b9g/ml, what is the estimated volume of the vascular pool? How does this estimate compare with the blood volume of an adult of about 5 liters and a serum volume of 2.75 liters? Exercise 12.2.2 a.Suppose 2 gm of mezlocillin are injected (bolus injection) into the serum of a patient with the result that at time t= 0 the serum concentration of mezlocillin is 200 \u00b9g/ml. Assume for this problem that the mezlocillin stays in the serum until removed by the kidneys and that the kidneys remove 20% of the mezlocillin from the serum every \u00afve minutes.

You should get the same answers as for A1,A2andA3in Exercise 12.2.3. Exercise 12.2.5 Compute A12andB12using either the Di\u00aeerence Equations 12.5 or the Iteration Equations 12.6 or the Solution Equations 12.7 (your choice). Compare A12with the observed value of penicillin concentration at 60 minutes in Figure 12.1. Exercise 12.2.6 Compute A24andB24using either the Di\u00aeerence Equations 12.5 or the Iteration Equations 12.6 or the Solution Equations 12.7 (your choice). Compare A24with the observed value of penicillin concentration at 120 minutes in Figure 12.1.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 531 Exercise 12.2.7 Explain the reasons for the terms in Equations 12.5 that account for Change, Increase, and Decrease of Atand of Bt. Exercise 12.2.8 Show that the proposed solutions, Equations 12.7, also satisfy B0= 0 and the second of Equations 12.6. Do exact arithmetic. Exercise 12.2.9 a.Compute AtandBtfrom Equations 12.6 or 12.7 for the times shown in Figure 12.1 and plot the original data and the computed data on a semilog graph. b.How do the values of Atcompare with with the observed concentration of penicillin? c.Except that they are discrete points, the two graphs for AtandBtcross. One might guess that the tissue concentration maximum occurs where the tissue concentration is the same as the serum concentration. Examine the graphs and determine whether this appears to be true. d.UseBt+1\u00a1Bt= 0:068At\u00a10:1Btto determine whether the maximum tissue concentration occurs when the tissue concentration is the same as the serum concentration. Exercise 12.2.10 Residence time is a measure of the average amount of time a chemical or biological agent spends in a well de\u00afned volume. You may read of the residence time of, for example, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, salt in an estuary, water in the atmosphere or in a lake or in ground water, or even vegetables in the market. In the one compartment example where 200 gm of salt are dissolved (into Na+and Cl\u00a1atoms) in 5 liters of water and 20% of the solution is replaced every \u00afve minutes with pure water, what is the average time that the Na+atoms spend in the \u00b0ask? This requires a bit of warmup. a.Compute the average age of your class if there are 22 students who are 18 years old, 16 students who are 19 years old, and 6 students who are 20 years old. b.The 'age' of the Na+atoms removed at the \u00afrst replacement is 5 minutes and 20% of the total, T, are removed and 80% of the total remain in the \u00b0ask. Argue that the average age, A3, of the Na+removed during the \u00afrst three replacements is 0 :8 + 0 :82 c.Write an expression for the average age, A20, of the Na+removed during the \u00afrst twenty replacements. d.A20and even A2000is easily evaluated using a computer or calculator program (or even a lot of patience), but the old guys developed some clever methods.

Shown in Figures 12.3 and 12.4 are two more graphs from T. Bergans, ibid. Figure 12.3 reports the serum concentration during constant infusion of carbenicillin into the serum pool; a diagram that can be used to model the process is included. The diagram has only a serum pool, a source from outside (infusion) leading into the serum pool and an exit from the pool (kidneys). A tissue compartment (dashed box) could be added to the diagram. As in the bolus injection model of the previous section, continuous infusion can be modeled in terms of salt in \u00b0asks, a task left for you in Exercise 12.3.3.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 533 500 250 100 50 25 10400 300 200 150 125 80 60 40 30 20 15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Hours after start of infusionSerum concentrations, \u00b5g/ml30 min. 1 h 2 h 4 h 8 h ?R0;1?R1;0 Serum Tissue-\u00be Figure 12.3: Graph of continuous infusion administration of carbenicillin, from Tom Bergans, ibid., page 73, Figure 16.

We will analyze the data for oral ingestion of ampicillin shown in Figure 12.4. We try to model the dark line in Figure 12.4. Estimates of serum concentrations of ampicillin read from the graph are shown in Table 12.1. It appears that there are at most six data points represented in the graph of Figure 12.4, and the two compartment model may be as 'rich' as can be justi\u00afed. We suggest, however, a three compartment model for you to try in Exercise 12.3.5. Two compartment model. Again we write in terms of water and salt in \u00b0asks. Flask 1 (GI tract) has 1 liter of water and at time t= 0, 9 grams of salt are added to it and it dissolves immediately. Flask 2 (Serum) has 2 liters of pure water in it. Each 30 minutes 35% of the liquid in \u00b0ask 2 (700 ml) is removed and discarded, after which 40% of the liquid in \u00b0ask 1 (400 ml) plus 300 ml of pure water is added to \u00b0ask B and 400 ml of pure water is added to \u00b0ask A. Notation. LetAtdenote the amount of salt in \u00b0ask 1 at time tandBtdenote the amount of salt in \u00b0ask 2 at time t, where tis measured in 30 minute intervals. The initial conditions are A0= 9:0 and B0= 0:0 The changes in AtandBtcan be accounted for as follows. Change Increase Decrease At+1\u00a1At= \u00a10:40At Bt+1\u00a1Bt= 0 :40At\u00a10:35Bt(12.8) These can be converted 0:4At+ 0:65Bt(12.9)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 535 You can readily write a formula for Atand are asked to do so in Exercise 12.3.2. In Section 12.4 you will \u00afnd how to write the formula for Bt: Bt= 72\u00a3(0:65t\u00a10:6t) (12.10) Using this equation for Bt, the numbers in the 'Computed Concentration' column of Table 12.1 are readily computed. It is apparent from the graph in Table 12.1 that the overall shape of the computed graph is similar to that of the original data and the concentrations for the later times are similar in both. The computed data 'peaks early,' however. It would peak even earlier were it not for the large discrete time interval of 30 minutes. An alternate model with 10 minute intervals is suggested in Exercise 12.3.5 that more closely \u00afts the data. We have given three examples of data for penicillin administration and di\u00aeerence equation models that could be descriptive of the kinetics of the penicillin. We have also stated solutions to the di\u00aeerence equations, without giving procedures to \u00afnd the solutions. There are some general procedures for \u00afnding the solutions, and the next two sections are directed to that end. Exercises for Section 12.3, Continuous infusion and oral administrations of penicillin. Exercise 12.3.1 Explain the reasons for the terms in Equations 12.8 that account for Increase and Decrease of Atand of Bt. Exercise 12.3.2 Find the solution to A0= 9:0 At+1= 0:6At; which the \u00afrst equation in Equations 12.9. scarp Exercise 12.3.3 Analysis of continuous infusion of carbenicillin. Figure 12.3 contains data of concentrations of carbenicillin in serum during and after continuous infusion into healthy volunteers (medical students). You are to analyze a model of that system. A \u00b0ask (Serum) has 10 liters of pure water. Each 10 minutes, one liter (10%) of the liquid is removed from the \u00b0ask, after which one liter of water containing salt with a concentration of 66 grams per liter is added to the \u00b0ask and the \u00b0ask is well stirred. LetAtdenote the amount of salt in the \u00b0ask at time t. a.Read and record the carbenicillin concentrations of the 8h curve in Figure 12.3 for the hours 1 to 8. Assume that concentration at hour 0 was 0. Interpret that curve to show that infusion continued at a constant rate for 8 hours and was terminated at the end of 8 hours. b.What is A0? c.Write an equation that accounts for the Change, Increase, and Decrease of Ateach ten minute interval, similar in form to that of Equation 12.8.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 536 d.Write the initial condition and an iteration equation that will enable the computation of Atfor any 10 minute interval. e.Your iteration equation should be of the form At+1=q\u00a3At+p. You solved equations of this form in Section 1.8. Write a solution to your iteration equation. f.Compare the salt concentrations to the carbenicillin concentrations for hours 0 to 8 that you read from the graph. g.After infusion is terminated at 8 hours, the concentration decreases linearly on the semilog graph. Compare this with the nonlinear decrease following bolus injection shown in Figure 12.1. What di\u00aeerence in the states of the two patients may account for the di\u00aeerence in response? h.Discuss the advisability of including a tissue compartment (dashed box in Figure 12.3) in the model of the data of the \u00afgure. Exercise 12.3.4 Repeat the analysis of Exercise 12.3.3 for the 4 hour curve. Use the model of Exercise 12.3.3 and adjust the concentration of the salt in the water added to the \u00b0ask at each ten minute interval. Exercise 12.3.5 As discussed in the analysis of the oral ingestion of ampicillin, the concentration predicted by our solution 'peaked' too early to match the data. One possible interpretation is that following ingestion of the pill into the stomach, there was a time of transition to the intestine where it was then absorbed into serum. This would suggest a model described by the diagram in Exercise Figure 12.3.5 Imagine three \u00b0asks A, B, and C, containing 1.5, 2.0 and 1.0 liters, respectively, of pure water. At time t= 0, 21 g of salt is placed in \u00b0ask A and immediately dissolves. Every 10 minutes 300 ml (30%) of solution is removed from \u00b0ask C and discarded, 300 ml (15%) of solution is transferred from \u00b0ask B to \u00b0ask C, and 300 (20%) ml of water is transferred from \u00b0ask A to \u00b0ask B. Finally, 300 ml of pure water is added to \u00b0ask A. Let At,Bt, and Ctdenote the amount of salt in \u00b0asks A, B, and C at time interval t. a.What are A0,B0andC0? b.Write equations that accounts for the Change, Increase, and Decrease in each of At,Bt, and Ct each ten minute interval. similar in form to that of Equation 12.8. c.Write the initial conditions and an iteration equations that will enable the computation of At,Bt, andCtfor any 10 minute interval. d.Show \u00a30:8t Bt= equations. e.Use the solution equation for Ctfrom part d. to compute ampicillin concentrations for times 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours and compare those values with the values shown in Table 12.1.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 537 Figure for Exercise 12.3.5 Diagram of 3 compartment model of oral ingestion of ampicillin for Exercises 12.3.5 and 12.3.6 Stomach -R2;1Intestine -R3;2Serum -R0;3 Exercise 12.3.6 The three compartment model for oral ingestion of 500 mg of ampicillin diagrammed in Exercise Figure 12.3.5 can be described more simply than was done in Exercise 12.3.5. The solutions of the iteration equations are unusual, but match the data well. Imagine three \u00b0asks A, B, and C, each containing 1.0 liter of pure water. At time t= 0, 14 g of salt is placed in \u00b0ask A and immediately dissolves. Every 10 minutes 200 ml (20%) of solution is removed from \u00b0ask C and discarded, 200 ml (20%) of solution is transferred from \u00b0ask B to \u00b0ask C, and 200 ml (20%) of water is transferred from \u00b0ask A to \u00b0ask B. Finally, 200 ml of pure water is added to \u00b0ask A. LetAt,Bt, and Ctdenote the amount of salt in \u00b0asks A, B, and C at time interval t. a.What are A0,B0andC0? b.Write equations that accounts for the Change, Increase, and Decrease in each of At,Bt, and Ct each ten minute interval. similar in form to that of Equation 12.8. c.Write the initial conditions and an iteration equations that will enable the computation of At,Bt, andCtfor any 10 minute interval. e.Use solution equation for Ctfrom part d. to compute ampicillin concentrations for times 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours and compare those values with the values shown in Table 12.1. 12.4 Solutions to pairs of di\u00aeerence equations. Ackerman, August 12, 2010 538 are presented as Twin Lightning Bolts Out of the Blue without indication of their source.

Stage 1. The Stage 1 goal is to obtain an equation that only involves the sequence A0,A1,A2,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2. We eliminate Btfrom the Equations 12.11 by a2;2\u00a3At+1=a2;2\u00a3a1;1\u00a3At+a2;2\u00a3a1;2\u00a3Bt At+2\u00a1(a1;1+a2;2)\u00a3At+1+ (a1;1\u00a3a2;2\u00a1a1;2\u00a3a2;1)\u00a3At= 0 (12.14) Equation 12.14 is a second order linear di\u00aeerence equation that we write as At+2\u00a1p\u00a3At+1+q\u00a3At= 0 p=a1;1+a2;2 q=a1;1\u00a3a2;2\u00a1a1;2\u00a3a2;1(12.15) If the \u00afrst two initial values, A0andA1, are known, then all subsequent values of Atcan be computed from At+2\u00a1p\u00a3At+1+q\u00a3At= 0 Explore 12.4.1 Do this. a.Show that 154 At+2\u00a11:67At+1+ 0:6862At= 0 Stage 2. The Stage 2 goal is to \u00afnd a solution to At+2\u00a1p\u00a3At+1+q\u00a3At= 0 Observe that At= 0 for all time tis a solution, but is not very helpful in describing penicillin pharmacokinetics, (with A0= 200 and A1= 154) and we need a more interesting solution. Thinking optimistically, we note that the \u00afrst order iteration equation Pt+1=R\u00a3Pt has a solution: Pt=C\u00a3Rt and we try for a similar solution At=C\u00a3rtto At+2\u00a1p\u00a3At+1+q\u00a3At= 0 IfAt=C\u00a3rt, then At+1=C\u00a3rt+1andAt+2=C\u00a3rt+2and rt\u00a3r2\u00a1p\u00a3rt\u00a3r1+q\u00a3rt\u00b4 = 0 C\u00a3rt\u00a3\u00b3 r2\u00a1p\u00a3r+q\u00b4 = 0 One of the factors in the previous product must be zero. The choices C= 0 and rt= 0 yield At\u00b40 { not helpful. Therefore we try r2\u00a1pr+q= 0 (12.16) which is a quadratic equation and has (with luck) two nonzero real roots r1=p+q p2\u00a14q 2and r2=p\u00a1q p2\u00a14q 2 For this section we assume that r1and r2are distinct and real. We have reason to hope that we have found two solutions At=C\u00a3rt 1andAt=C\u00a3rt 2. It gets even better than that! We will show in Stage 3 that for any two numbers, C1andC2, At=C1\u00a3rt 1+C2\u00a3rt 2 solves At+2\u00a1pAt+1+qAt= 0 (12.17) Equation 12.16, r1=p+q p2\u00a14q 2and r2=p\u00a1q p2\u00a14q 2are called the characteristic roots both the di\u00aeerence equation At+2\u00a1p\u00a3At+1+q\u00a3At= 0 and (when p=a1;1+a2;2andq=a1;1\u00a3a2;2\u00a1a1;2\u00a3a2;1) the iteration equations At+1=a1;1\u00a3At+a1;2\u00a3Bt Bt+1=a2;1\u00a3At+a2;2\u00a3Bt:Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 540 Explore 12.4.2 Do this.

The 0's in the last step are because r1andr2are the roots to r2\u00a1pr+q= 0. Stage 4. (Hang on, we are about there!) We need to evaluate C1andC2and will choose them so that the solution At=C1\u00a3rt 1+C2\u00a3rt 2 to the iteration At+2\u00a1pAt+1+qAt= 0 matches the initial data. A0andB0are Given.

It is a generally useful result that: Theorem 12.5.1 Ifr1andr2are the roots to x2\u00a1px+q= 0 then r1+r2=p and r1\u00a3r2=q: (12.22) (The result is valid even in case of a root equal to zero, r 2=0.If the characteristic equation, r2\u00a1pr+q= 0 has a root equal to zero, r2= 0, A1=a1;1A0+a1;2B0andB1=a2;1A0+a2;2B0, respectively. It may not be thatA1=p\u00a3A0. The case of repeated roots, r 1=r2.Biological systems are unlikely to be so \u00afnely tuned that r1=r2. However, there is a simple solution. If r1=r2, because r1+r2=p, the repeated root, r1=p 2. In Exercise 12.5.1 you are asked to show that when r1=r2is a repeated root, At=t\u00a3rt 1 solves At+2\u00a1pAt+1+qAt= 0:Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 547 and for any two numbers C1andC2, At=C1rt 1+C2\u00a3t\u00a3rt 1 solves At+2\u00a1pAt+1+qAt= 0: We next show that every solution of At+2\u00a1pAt+1+qAt= 0 is of the form At=C1rt 1+C2\u00a3t\u00a3rt 1: To see this, we assume that A0andB0are known and A1=a1;1A0+a1;2B0has been computed. Then we solve 1 1 forC1andC2. Assume that r16= 0. Then C1=A0andC2=A1\u00a1A0r1r1are uniquely determined. In the case that r1= 0, repeated root of zero, then both p= 0 and q= 0 and At= 0 and Bt= 0 for t\u00b82. The case r 1=a+bi, i=p\u00a11.An interesting and important case occurs when the discriminant p2\u00a14q <0 and the roots r1=a+biandr2=a\u00a1biare complex formulas At=C1\u00a3rt 1+C2\u00a3rt 2 C1=A1\u00a1r2A0 r1\u00a1r2C2=r1A0\u00a1A1 r1\u00a1r2 are valid, but are painful to work with. Normally, A0,A1,pandqare real so that all of A2,A3,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2are real. Because r1andr2are complex, it is di\u00b1cult to see that the previous formulas de\u00afne real values for At(but they do). Such systems arise, for example in Section 12.10.3 when considering equilibrium points of predator-prey systems. The following system is similar to Equation 12.76 of that section. \u00bb0= to departure from equilibrium of a predator and prey, respectively, and the initial conditions re\u00b0ect an excess of prey. The roots to the characteristic equation, p2\u00a11:92p+ 0:9316 = 0 are r1= 0:96 + 0 :10iandr1= 0:96\u00a10:10i. Two graphs of \u00bbtand\u00b4tare shown in Figure 12.5. Both graphs illustrate the periodic variation associated with complex roots and with predator-prey systems. With an excess of prey at time 0, the predator population increases causing a decrease in the prey population to a level below the equilibrium population, which is followed by a decrease in the prey population.

Penicillin kinetics. Suppose you initiate constant penicillin infusion in a patient at the rate of 32.4 \u00b9g/ml-serum every \u00afve minutes. What will be the serum penicillin concentration as time progresses? (Does your patient explode with too much penicillin?) Assume the kinetics of penicillin are and Btdenotes tissue penicillin concentration. Equations 12.32 account for body processing of penicillin, but do not account for your infusion of 32.4\u00b9g/ml-serum. Because all of the infused penicillin enters the serum pool, we write a model: Mathematical Model. Every \u00afve minutes, 6.8% of the serum penicillin di\u00aeuses to tissue, 10% of the tissue penicillin di\u00aeuses to serum, the kidneys remove 16.2 percent of the serum penicillin, and 32.4 \u00b9g/ml-serum penicillin is added to the serum. We assume your patient had no penicillin in his body when you initiated treatment, and write: Initial InternalBody Infusion Conditions Kinetics Bt+1\u00a1Bt= 0:068\u00a3At\u00a10:10\u00a3Bt(12.33) Theequilibrium state of your patient, if such exists, will be described by two numbers, AeandBe, such that At!Ae and Bt!Be as t! 1 Explore 12.7.1 Assume that your patient has reached an equilibrium state so that the levels of serum and tissue penicillin are constants, AeandBe.

From the \u00b9g/ml We \u00afnd the equilibrium values for your patient, and \u00afnd a not very intuitive result that the tissue penicillin concentration at equilibrium is less than (68% of) the serum penicillin concentration.

The origin, (0,0), is a stable equilibrium for both of these systems. Then ( At; Bt)!(Ae; Be) of Equations xt; yt)!(0;0)); or ( Ae; Be) is a stable equilibrium point of Equations 12.34 if and only if (0,0) is a stable equilibrium point of the simpler set of Equations 12.36. The Equations 12.36 are said Equations 12.34 are nonhomogeneous ifH16= 0 or H26= 0. The following four examples demonstrate the primary dynamics of two \u00afrst order di\u00aeerence equations near equilibrium points. In all four cases, the origin is the equilibrium point, the initial conditions, x0= 0:25 and y0= 0:5 are identical, and the equation yn+1= 0:1\u00a3xn+ 0:86\u00a3ynare the same. Furthermore, the coe\u00b1cients in the equations for xn+1are similar, but methodically are trajectories in the phase plane of (xt; yt), plots of ytversus xt, a common graph when looking at equilibria. You may be more familiar with graphs of xtversus tandyt versus t, and the graph in Figure 12.7 shows such a plot for Equations 12.37B. In Examples A and B, the trajectories move towards the equilibrium point (0,0). From all initial conditions the trajectories converge to (0,0), and (0,0) is a stable equilibrium point. In Examples C and D the trajectories diverge to in\u00afnity, and will do so for any starting point di\u00aeerent from (0,0).

Examples C and D the equilibrium point (0,0) is not stable. Because (0,0) is an equilibrium point of all four dynamical systems of Equations 12.36, any trajectory that starts at (0,0) stays at (0,0) for all four of them. The question of stability is whether trajectories that start at a point di\u00aeerent from the equilibrium point (0,0) converge to (0,0). Unstable equilibria rarely occur in biological systems because there are enough random perturbations of biological systems to insure that even if a system is exactly in an equilibrium state that is unstable, it will soon be perturbed and move away from the unstable equilibrium. Stable equilibria, however, are very important in biological systems. Once a system is at or near a stable equilibrium, it will tend to return to or stay near the equilibrium condition when random perturbations move it a small distance away from equilibrium. Trajectories A and C di\u00aeer noticeably from trajectories B and D, which spiral around the equilibrium point. The spirals are due to the complex roots of the characteristic polynomials associated with the systems of Examples B and D.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 560 What happens to x tas t! 1?

The roots of the dynamical systems A - D in Equations 12.36 are 0:946; 0:946 and jr2j= 0:814 are both less than 1. B. is stable because \u00bd= 0:924 is less than 1. C. is not stable because jr1j= 1:08 is greater than one; that jr2j= 0:679 is less than one is not redeeming. D. is not stable because \u00bd= 1:03 is greater than 1. Without actually computing the roots of the characteristic Equation 12.36, one can determine whether the dynamical systems Equations 12.36 are stable by examining the coe\u00b1cients.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 561 Theorem 12.8.2 The fate of and Equations 12.36, with characteristic equation z2\u00a1(m1;1+m2;2)\u00a3z+m1;1m2;2\u00a1m2;1m1;2=z2\u00a1pz+q= if 0\u00b7 jpj<1 +q <2: Proof.

Then if the roots are real and distinct they must lie between -1 and 1 and the steps of the previous argument may be reversed to show that jpj< q+ 1<2. If the root p2\u00a14q <0, sojpj<2pq < q + 1, as above.

Biological systems tend to be nonlinear and we wish to determine when the equilibrium points of nonlinear dynamical systems are asymptotically stable. The principle way of doing so is to show that the local linear approximation to the dynamical system at an equilibrium is stable. We de\u00afne the local linear approximation below; it is a linear dynamical system and its stability is the stability of a linear system as de\u00afned in De\u00afnition 12.8.2.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 566 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 100.20.40.60.81 L Fy = x (ae,ae) Figure 12.8: Graphs of a function Fand its tangent line, Lat an equilibrium point ( a; the local linear approximation to F. De\u00afnition Asymptotical Stability. An yt) be):(12.47) The system 12.46 is asymptotically stable at (ae; be) if there is a positive number \u00b1such that if ( x0; y0) is within a one-dimensional iteration xt+1=F(xt) at an equilibrium point, ae=F(ae), is the linear iteration xt+1=F(ae) +F0(ae)(xt\u00a1ae) (12.48) (see Figure 12.8). The linear iteration is stable (Exercise 12.9.2) if and only if jF0(ae)j<1. Furthermore, By Theorem 11.4.1, the one dimensional dynamical system xt+1=F(xt)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 567 is asymptotically stable at an equilibrium ae=F(ae) ifjF0(ae)j<1. Thus the nonlinear xt+1=F(xt) is asymptotically stable if its linear approximation xt+1=L(xt) is stable. We will \u00afnd a similar result for the two dimensional dynamical system 12.46. De\u00afnition 12.9.2 Suppose FandGare functions of two variables and ( a; b) is in the domain of both FandGand the partial derivatives F1,F2,G1, and G2are all continuous on the interior of a circle with center at ( a; b). The local linear approximation to the two dimensional dynamical system xt+1=F(xt; yt) yt+1=G(xt; yt)(12.49) at is called b) of the transformation u=F(x; y) v)-plane. Example 12.9.1 In the next section we consider two populations that have a symbiotic relationship, a special case of which is August 12, 2010 568 An equilibrium point of the system is (1.96,2.4) and the Jacobian matrix at (1.96, G1(1:96;2:4) = 0 :1 G2(1:96;2:4) = 0 :86 Then the Jacobian matrix and homogeneous local linear approximation to Equations 12.54 at the may recognize this linear dynamical system as being that of Equations 12.37A for which the characteristic roots are approximately 0.946 and 0.814. The homogeneous linear dynamical system 12.55 is stable. Because the local linear approximation 12.55 to the nonlinear dynamical system 12.54 at the point (1.96,2.4) is stable, the nonlinear dynamical system 12.54 is asymptotically stable at (1.96,2.4). The basis for the previous paragraph is in Theorem 12.9.1. The idea of the theorem and of local linear approximation can be seen by an algebraic rearrangement of the nonlinear system 12.54 120(xt\u00a11:96)(yt\u00a12:4)\u00a17 120(yt\u00a11:96)2 The linear terms are those of the local linear approximation. The idea of Theorem 12.9.1 is that if (xt; yt) is close to the equilibrium (1.96,2.4) so that xt\u00a11:96 and yt\u00a12:4 yt\u00a11:96)2are '(small)2', even smaller, and contribute very little in computing the trajectory.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 569 Theorem 12.9.1 Stability of local linear approximation implies asymptotic stability of the nonlinear system. Suppose ( ae; be) is an equilibrium point of a dynamical system xt+1=F(xt; yt) yt+1=G(xt; yt)(12.56) the 12.56 is asymptotically stable. We assume that F andGand their partial derivatives are continuous and the domains of Fand Gare all number pairs. The proof of Theorem 12.9.1 is beyond the scope of this text. We will assume that it is true and apply it to four examples in the next section. Exercises for Section 12.9, Local linear approximations to nonlinear systems.

We now consider a population of deer growing in an environment that will support 500 female animals. Assume the low density growth rate to be 0.16 and that 15 female deer are harvested from the population each year. Because deer reach sexual maturity in their second year, the equation for population change is Population Kinetics Harvest wt+1\u00a1wt= 0:16\u00a3wt\u00a11\u00a3\u00b3 1\u00a1wt\u00a11 500\u00b4 \u00a115(12.59) where wtis the of adult female deer in year t. The number 0.16 that we have called the low density growth rate accounts for both the survival for two years of the population measured by wt\u00a11and the survival of the fauns born to those deer. It is helpful to divide each term by 500 and let vt=wt500. Then vt+1\u00a1vt= 0:16\u00a3vt\u00a11\u00a3(1\u00a1vt\u00a11)\u00a10:03 (12.60) Equation 12.60 may be treated as a second order nonlinear dynamical system in one variable, or as we next show, as a \u00afrst order nonlinear dynamical system in two variables. Letwt=vt\u00a11. Then Equation 12.60 may be written as vt+1=vt+ 0:16wt(1\u00a1wt)\u00a10:03 wt+1=vt(12.61) The equilibrium points of ve; we) where ve=ve+ 0:16we(1\u00a1we)\u00a10:03 we=veCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 572 which is equivalent to ve=ve+ 0:16ve(1\u00a1ve)\u00a10:03 0 = \u00a10:16v2 e\u00a1ve+ 0:188) = \u00a10:16(ve\u00a10:25)(ve\u00a10:75) The equilibrium points of the iteration equation are (0.25,0.25) and (0.75,0.75).

That the dynamical system 12.61 is asymptotically stable at (0.75,0.75) is in Exercise 12.10.2. 12.10.2 Symbiosis Systems. Imagine two interacting populations, XandY, with population numbers at time n,XnandYn.Xhas a low density growth rate, rx, and in isolation, the maximum supportable Xpopulation is M. The presence of Y, however, expands the supportable Xpopulation. If Ynis at its isolation maximum of N, then Xcan grow to (1 + \u00ae)M(\u00aeand\u00afare positive). In turn, the presence of Xexpands As often happens it is useful to divide by maximum supportable populations and use variables that are fractions of maximum supportable populations. Divide the \u00afrst equation of Equations 12.63 by Mand the second parameters whereas the original Equations 12.63 involved six. The dynamics and stability conditions are identical, however. Let (xe; ye) denote an equilibrium point of Equations 12.64. Then xnandynare not when +\u00afxe\u00a1ye) = are four solutions: (xe; ye) = (0 ;0);(xe; ye) = marked on Figure 12.9 along with the lines 1 + \u00aey\u00a1x= 0 and 1 + \u00afx\u00a1y= 0. The arrows point from ( xn; yn) toward ( xn+1; yn+1). If you follow a path of arrows, you will move toward the equilibrium point, (xe; ye) =\u00c31 +\u00ae 1\u00a1\u00ae\u00af;1 +\u00af 1\u00a1\u00ae\u00af! the (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0). In the shaded region, xn+1\u00a1xn > 0 because 1 +\u00aeyn\u00a1xn>0 and yn+1\u00a1yn > 0 because 1 + \u00afxn\u00a1yn>0. Therefore all of the arrows point up and to the right. Explore 12.10.1 .

The root 1 + ry+ry\u00afis greater than 1 ( ry>0 and \u00afry>0) so the local linear approximation to the nonlinear system 12.64 is not stable and we conclude that the nonlinear system is not asymptotically stable at the equilibrium point (1,0). At the equilibrium point (1,0), the population Yis not present and the population Xis at its maximum supportable population Min the absence of Y.

We give conditions under which we can show that the local linear approximation at (xe; ye) is stable even without computing the characteristic roots. First we observe that if \u00ae\u00a3\u00af >1, then the equilibrium point xe=1+\u00ae 1\u00a1\u00ae\u00af; ye=1+\u00af 1\u00a1\u00ae\u00afhas negative coordinates, a decidedly un-biological result. We assume for analysis that both \u00ae <1 and \u00af <1. Furthermore xxe<1; and ryye<1 then point (xe; ye) = xn+1\u00a1xn=rx\u00a2xn(1 +\u00aeyn\u00a1xn) has positive coordinates and the system is asymptotically stable at ( xe; ye). Proof.

Xis the predator, and has a low density growth rate, rx, and in isolation, the maximum supportable X-population is M. However, presence of the prey Y expands the supportable X-population. If Ynis at its isolation maximum of N, then Xcan grow to (1 +\u00ae)M(\u00aeand\u00afare positive). Yhas a low density growth rate of ryand in the absence of Xhas a maximum supportable population of N. However, If Xis at its isolation maximum of M, the maximum Yis reduced to 1 \u00a1\u00aftimes N. Because of the similarity of the predator-prey equations 12.71 to the symbiosis equations 12.63, most of the work of this subsection is in the form of exercises. 12.10.4 Competition. Imagine that there are two populations, XandY, competing for the same resource.

In nature the parameters, rx,ry,\u00ae, and \u00af, are not constant in time, they may change with seasons, for example, and it is unusual to have only two species interacting. Nevertheless, the models we study are suggestive of natural behavior. Some interesting data in Figure 12.12 is redrawn from Parsons et al1regarding oceanic phytoplankton (prey) and zooplankton (predator). Perhaps plants are not usually considered prey, but the model works in this setting. Observe \u00afrst the periodic variation in total phytoplankton and zoopankton in the graphs. The Artic suggests variation in rxwith the season, and thus re\u00b0ects external forces a\u00aeecting the system. But the within year oscillations of the North Atlantic is suggestive of complex roots associated with an equilibrium point, a property internal to the system.

The imaginary part of the roots cause the spiral around the equilibrium point. However, the magnitude of the imaginary part is so small compared to the real part that the rotation is rather slow.

In this chapter we will use the famil- iar concept of the area of a rectangle to form approximations to areas of regions that are of non-rectangular shape. The regions of greatest immediate interest are regions lying between the graph of a function and the horizontal axis. The areas of such regions of have important uses such as the accumulated deposit of a chemical or waste product, the dis- tance traveled by an object, measure- ment of cardiac output, and the aver- age value of a function. 00.511.522.533.5400.511.522.533.54Four rectangles approximating an irregular region 13.1 Areas of Irregular Regions. Area of an oak leaf. Explore 13.1.1 Describe two ways to approximate the area of the leaf shown in Figure 13.1. You may think of several interesting ways of solving the previous problem. A way that we will generalize to future applications is illustrated by two problems following Figure 13.1. 585Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 586 Figure 13.1: An Oak leaf.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 587 One of the more curious ways of estimating the area of the leaf in Figure 13.1 is to paste the page on a dart board and throw darts at the page from a distance su\u00b1cient to insure that the points where the dart hits the page are randomly distributed on the page. The number, NP, of darts that strike the page and the number, NL, of darts that strike the leaf can be counted. The area of the leaf is approximated by Area of the leaf:=NL NPAP Although the procedure may seem a bit esoteric, it is used in serious computations of volumes in high dimension (with points randomly generated by a computer algorithm rather than darts!). Explore 13.1.2 The darker grid lines in Figure 13.2 are marked at 1.0 cm intervals. Count the number I1of 1.0 cm2squares entirely covered by the leaf and the number O1of 1.0 cm2squares that intersect the leaf (including those included in I1). Use the squares to estimate the area of the leaf. The \u00afner grid on the leaf in Figure 13.2 is marked at 0.5 cm intervals. We count that I2= 283 of these squares are completely inside the leaf and a total of O2= 409 squares intersect the leaf (not including the stem). Because each square is of area 0.25 cm2the area of the leaf should be at least 283 \u00a3 0.25 = 70.75 cm2and no more than 409 \u00a30.25 13.1.3 How do 70.75 and 102.25 cm2compare with your answer based on the 1 cm2squares? Given the information so far obtained, what is your best estimate of the area of the leaf? How can you extend the procedure to get an even better answer? LetAdenote the area of the leaf in Figure 13.2. Because the area of each 1cm grid square is 1cm2, I1\u00a31 is the area of the region covered by the the 1cm grid squares inside the leaf, and I1\u00a31 is less than A. Because the squares that intersect the leaf enclose the leaf, O1\u00a31 is greater than A.

Shown in Figure 13.3 is (a portion of) the graph of the probability density function of the normal distribution, sometimes called the `Bell-shaped curve'. In the \u00afgure shown, the distribution has mean zero and standard deviation equal to one. The equation of the density function is f(x) =1p 2\u00bce\u00a1x2 2 \u00a1 1 < x < 1 (13.1) The interpretation of the density function is that if a measurement of a sample from a normal variate has been scaled so that the average value is zero and the standard deviation is one, then for any interval [ a; b] of measurement values, the probability that any one member of the sample lies in [ a; b] is the area of the region between x=aandx=band below the curve and above the horizontal axis. The area under the total curve, from \u00a11to +1is 1.0. The graph is symmetrical about the Y-axis, so that, for example, the area to the left of the vertical axis is equal to the area to the right of the vertical axis, the two areas sum to one, and therefore both areas are 0.5.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 588 Figure 13.2: An Oak leaf with 1cm and 0.5cm grids.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 589 A 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 1 1.5 200.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40.450.5 a b B 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 200.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40.450.5 Figure 13.3: A. A graph of a portion of the particular normal distribution that has mean zero and standard deviation one, Equation 13.1, f(x) =1p 2\u00bce\u00a1x2=2. The probability that a number drawn from this normal distribution lies in the interval [ a; b] is the area of the shaded region below the graph and above [ a; b]. B. The shaded region, R, is bounded by the graph of the normal distribution, the X-axis, and the vertical lines x=\u00a11 and x= 1. The normal distribution is important because many biological measurements (heights of European women, lengths of ears of a certain variety of corn) are approximately normally distributed about their means. Such quantities are thought to be essentially the sum of a large number of independent small quantities (determined by genetic factors that have additive e\u00aeects), which would account for their being normally distributed. Furthermore, for anydistribution, the means of repeated samples from the distribution are approximately normally distributed. For example, if you randomly select 50 people from a given population and compute the mean of their heights, and repeat this experiment 100 times, then the 100 means so computed will be approximately normally distributed. Example 13.1.1 Problem: Find (approximately) the area of the region Rin Figure 13.3B bounded by the graph of the normal distribution, f, the X-axis, the vertical line, x=\u00a11 and the vertical line, x= 1. Solution: 1.Because of the symmetry of the region Rabout the Y-axis, it is su\u00b1cient to \u00afnd the area of that portion of Rthat is to the right of the Y-axis, and then to multiply by 2. The portion Rto the right of the Y-axis is shown in Figure 13.4A. 2.Compute the sum of the areas of the upper rectangles in Figure 13.4A.

Same as A with lower rectangles included. 3.The sum of the areas of the \u00afve rectangles is 0.356234; twice the sum is 0.712469. This is an over estimate of the area of R. 4.An under estimate of the area can be computed by summing the areas of the lower rectangles in Figure 13.4B. The leftmost lower rectangle, based on the Xinterval [0 ;0:2] has the same area as the second upper rectangle from the left, based on the Xinterval [0 :2;0:4], and we computed that area to be 0.078209. The next three rectangles are similarly related to upper rectangles, and their areas are precisely the areas you computed in the preceding problem. The area of the right most lower rectangle is 1p 2\u00bce\u00a112 2\u00a30:2 = 0 :07358 and the sum of the \u00afve areas is 0.324840; twice the sum is 0.649680. 5.We now know that the area of R, is greater than 0.649680 and less than 0.712469. A good estimate of the area of Ris the average of these two bounds,0:649680 + 0 :712469 2= 0:681075.

Ozone: The Alfred Wegner Institute Foundation for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven Germany, has measured (among a large number of interesting things) ozone partial pressures at altitudes up to 35,000 meters since March 1992 at their Georg von Neumayer research Station in the Antarctic. Two http://www.awi-bremerhaven.de/ http://www.awi.de/en/infrastructure/stations/neumayer station/ 591 Figure 13.5: Ozone partial pressure at the Neumayer Station.

An image for 2004 is shown in Figure 13.5. Data read from that graph for the ozone partial pressure as a function of altitude on day 100 is shown in Table 13.1. Assume that the \\ozone layer\" lies between 14 and 28 kilometers. and that the density of the ozone is proportional to the partial pressure (which would be OK were the temperature constant). We ask, how much ozone is in the `ozone layer' on day 100 above the Neumayer station? More speci\u00afcally, we assume that the density of ozone in grams per kilometer cubed is a constant, K, times the partial pressure of ozone and ask how much ozone is in a column that is above a 100 meters (=0.1 km) by 100 meters square that surrounds the Neumayer antarctic station and between the altitudes 14 and 28 kilometers (see the diagram in Table 13.1). Consider \u00afrst that portion, P1, of the column between 14 and 16 km. The volume of P1is 0:1\u00a30:1\u00a32 km3= 0:02 km3 The ozone density at 14 km is K\u00a360 and at 16 km is K\u00a390 gm/km3. We assume that the average density for all of P1is the average of K\u00a360 and K\u00a390, or K\u00a375 gm/km3. Then the mass of ozone in P1is calculated as Mass of ozone in P1= 0 :02 km3\u00a3K\u00a375 gm/km3=K\u00a31:5 gm Similarly we calculate the mass of ozone in the portion, P2, of the column: Mass of ozone in P2= 0 :02 km3\u00a3K\u00a390 + 115 2gm/km3=K\u00a32:05 gm Continuing we get the mass of ozone in the layer above Neumayer station to be 13.7 gm. Exercises for Section 13.1, Areas of Irregular Regions. Exercise 13.1.1 Find (approximately) the area of the region in Figure 13.3 bounded by the graph of the normal distribution, f, the X-axis, the vertical line, x=\u00a12 and the vertical line, x= 2. Because we found the area of the region Rbounded by x=\u00a11 and x= 1 you might reasonably conclude that your main task is to \u00afnd the area of the region bounded by the graph of the normal distribution, the X-axis, the lines x= 1 and x= 2. Then add some numbers. You should \u00afnd that the probability of being within two standard deviations of the mean of the normal distribution is approximately 0.95 (the probability is 0.95449974 correct to eight digits). Exercise 13.1.2 Shown in Figure 13.6A are the hourly readings for solar radiation intensity for June 21, 2004 recorded by the University of Oregon Solar Radiation Monitors Laboratory at their station in Eugene, Oregon (http://solardat.uoregon.edu). The data are for 'global irradiance' which includes all radiation falling on a horizontal plate measured in watts/meter2. The data in Figure 13.6A shows that, for example, at 10 am the solar intensity was 780 w/m2on June 21, 2004 in Eugene, Oregon. If the solar intensity were constant at that value from, say, 9:30 am to 10:30 am, then the energy that would fall on a 1 meter2panel during that time would be 780 w-hr. This is the area of the rectangle encompassing 10 am in Figure 13.6A. The solar energy striking a 1 m2panel during the whole day is approximately the sum of the areas of the rectangles shown in Figure 13.6B.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 593 A 0 5 10 15 20 2501002003004005006007008009001000 Time of day, June 21, 2004Solar radiation w/m2 B 0 5 10 15 20 2501002003004005006007008009001000 Time of day, June 21, 2004Solar radiation w/m2 Figure 13.6: A graph of the solar intensity at Eugene, Oregon for June 21, 2004 (http://solardat.uoregon.edu).

Imagine a one meter square vertical column, C, of air starting at sea level and extending upwards to 40,000 meters. Shown in Figure 13.1.12 are `standard' values of atmospheric density as a function of altitude up to 40,000 meters (U.S. Standard Atmospheres 1976, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NASA, U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C. October 1976). The density is not constant throughout C, and the mass of Cmay be approximated by partitioning Cinto regions of `small' volume, assuming that the density is constant within each region, and approximating the mass within each of the regions. Then the object will approximately have Mass = \u00b11\u00a3v1+\u00b12\u00a3v2+\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2+\u00b1n\u00a3vn where \u00b1kKg/m3andvkm3are respectively the density and volume in the kthregion. a.Partition the altitude interval from 0 to 40,000 meters into at least 6 subintervals (they need not be all the same length). For each interval, \u00afnd the volume of the region of Ccorresponding to the interval and \u00afnd a density of the air within that region.

The method extends to the other equations. The observation that \u00afrst order di\u00aeerence equations with initial conditions speci\u00afed have unique solutions is crucial to these arguments. See discussion beginning on page 470.

Because there is only one solution, the two expressions must be the same, thus establishing that 12+ 22+ 33+\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2+t2=t(t+ 1)(2 1Carl F. Gauss's fourth grade teacher assigned his class the task of computing 1 + 2 + \u00a2\u00a2\u00a299 + 100 (probably to keep the little rascals busy for a while). Young Carl quickly responded, 5050, and explained that 1 + 2 + \u00a2\u00a2\u00a299 + 100 = (1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2(50+51) = 50 \u00a3101 = 5050. Note that 50 \u00a3101 =100\u00a3101 2. To his credit, the teacher promptly recognized genius, and brought Gauss to the attention of the local nobleman.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 599 Step 1. wt=t(t+ 1)(2 t+ 1) 6satis\u00afes Equation 13.6. w1=1(1 + 1)(2 \u00a31 + 1) 6= 1 so that the initial condition is satis\u00afed.

We have been using the symbol, \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2, called an ellipsis. of writing these additional terms is rather limited, and most students readily accept this abbreviation2. It is particularly useful in writing sums with 1000 or more terms. On occasions, one sees a generic formula for the k thterm in the sum. The generic term is useful, and it is important to be able to recognize a pattern for the terms of the sum. When k= 1 is substituted into the generic formula\u00b3 k 10\u00b42we get\u00b3 1 10\u00b42which is the \u00afrst term of the sum. Similarly, substitution of k= 2 yields the second term, and substitution of k= 10 yields the 10th term. 2This is easily grasped, as illustrated by the title of a children's book, \\One, Two, Skip a Few, Ninety-nine, One Hundred\".Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 602 Some sums and generic terms are illustrated below. p 7 +p 8 +p 9 +p 10 5) + sin(5\u00bc 5) sin( k\u00bc 5)5X k=1sin(k\u00bc 5) There is a compact notation that focuses attention on the generic term: 10X k=12 4\u00c3k 10!2 \u00a31 103 5 Pis the Greek letter, sigma, to which the Latin letter Scorresponds and symbolizes sum. The entire symbol is read \\The sum from k equal to 1 to 10 of\u00b3 k 10\u00b42times1 10\". It may also be read as \\The sum from k equal to 1 to k equal to 10 of\u00b3 k 10\u00b42times1 10\" and might the \u00a7 notation preferable as it is much more compact. In fact, after you use it a while, you will likely \u00afnd that you can more quickly grasp the meaning of the sum with the shorter notation. It will help you to use algebra like is use of the distributive property, and can be seen from long notation with which you are familiar: rectangle approximation B 00.511.522.533.5400.511.522.533.54Lower rectangle approximation Figure 13.7: A.

In the Example 13.2.2 the top edges of the approximating rectangles were entirely on or above the graph of y=t2and are called upper rectangles and their sum, U50, is an upper approximation to the area under consideration, as shown in Figure 13.7A. When the top edges of the rectangles lie entirely on or below the graph, the rectangles are called lower rectangles and their sum is called a lower approximation , as shown in Figure 13.7B.

We generalize from the previous problems and de\u00afne a procedure for computing the area of a region, R, bounded above by the graph of a function, f, below by the hori- zontal axis, on the left by a line t=aand on the right by a line t=b. The function, f, should be de\u00afned and positive for all tin [a,b]. We will assume fis increasing on [ a; b]. Bounds on the errors of our estimates will be obtained. 00 a by = f( t ) Assume fis a positive increasing function de\u00afned on an interval [ a; b]. We describe a procedure to compute the area of the region between the graph of fand the X-axis as illustrated in Figure 13.8A. The function fmay have one or more discontinuities. The region should be considered as the union of the vertical segments reaching from the horizontal axis to a point on the graph of f. We can approximate the area of the region R as follows: \u00b2Choose a number, n, of rectangles to be used. \u00b2Leth=b\u00a1a n. \u00b2Partition the interval [ a=t0< t1< t2<\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2tn\u00a11; tn=b.

The upper sum is 5 :51557\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2. The error box for this computation is shown to the right of the region. Because each rectangle is of width4 20= 0:2, the error box is of width 0.2. The height of the error box isp 4\u00a1p 0 = 2 so the error in the approximation, 5 :51557\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2is no larger than 2 \u00a40:2 = 0 :4. 2.On the other hand, one may wish to compute the area of the region in Figure 13.3.1.1 correct to 0.01, and need to know how many intervals are required to insure that accuracy. For any number, n, of intervals, The error box is of heightp 4\u00a1p 0 = 2 and width4\u00a10 n Thus, The size of the error box is 2 \u00a34\u00a10 n=8 n Because the error is sure to be less than the size of the error box, our desired accuracy will be obtained if the size of the error box is less than 0.01. Therefore we require8n<0:01 so that 8 0:01< n, orn= 800. We will \u00afnd that the actual error is only approximately one-half the size of the error box, and that n= 400 will almost give the required accuracy.

The plunger of area 5.5 cm2was extracted to 60 cc and the air inside the cylinder was at standard atmospheric pressure of P0= 760 mm mercury = 10.13 Newton/cm2. The plunger was pushed inward at 5 cc increments (to the 55 cc mark, to 50 cc, \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2to 20 cc and to 15 cc) and the pressure was recorded at each step (table in Figure 13.12). The distance between 5 cc marks on the syringe was 0.9 cm. Problem. How much work was done? Solution.

The chart in Figure 13.13 shows the timing of events in the cardiac cycle (from Rhodes and Tanner, Figure 14-1, page 262).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 619 a.Find the graph showing the `Aortic blood \u00b0ow (ventricular out\u00b0ow)' measured in Liters/min. Read at least six data points from the graph and compute the total aortic \u00b0ow during one cardiac cycle. This is referred to as `Stroke Volume'. Note that the horizontal scale is in seconds and the vertical scale is in L/min. The calibration of the vertical axis has been changed from the original source as suggested by Professor Tanner in an e-mail message. b.The stroke volume may also be de\u00afned as the di\u00aeerence in the volume of blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole and the volume of blood in the ventricle at the end of systole. Find the curve `Ventricular Volume', compute stroke volume from it, and compare with your previous computation. c.It appears that one cardiac cycle takes about 0.8 seconds (from R wave to R wave, the second R wave is at 0.92 seconds), so that the heart is beating at 60 =0:8 = 75 beats per minute. Multiply the stroke volume for a single beat by 75 and compare with the conventional 5 - 6 Liters/minute for a resting adult. Exercise 13.3.12 External Cardiac Work. This problem is directed to measuring the work done by the heart referred to as external work. If liquid is pumped through a tube at a constant \u00b0ow rate, Rcm3/sec and at a constant pressure, P Newtons/cm2, during a time interval, [ a; b] measured in seconds, then the work done, W, is W=R\u00a3P\u00a3(b\u00a1a) Newton-cm : a.Con\u00afrm that the units on R\u00a3P\u00a3(b\u00a1a) are Newton-cm, units of work. b.Suppose the \u00b0ow rate or pressure is not constant.

Write an approximation to the work, W, of pumping the liquid at the \u00b0ow rateR(t) and pressure P(t) during [ a; b] based on the partition. c.In the Figure 13.13 there are curves that show the Aortic blood \u00b0ow (ventricular out\u00b0ow) in liters/minute and the Left ventricular pressure in mm Hg. One mm Hg = 0.01333 Newton/cm2. Read six points from each of these graphs and approximate the work done by a single stroke of the heart. A much larger amount of work is done by the heart as `Internal Work' that `includes transporting ions across membranes, internal mechanical events \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2, overcoming internal viscosity, and rearranging the muscular architecture as the heart contracts4'. Heart e\u00b1ciency is de\u00afned as the ratio of External Work to the sum of External and Internal Work and ranges from 5 to 10 percent.

Exercise 13.3.16 Work against the force of gravity. Suppose a 3 kilogram mass instrument is lifted 20,000 kilometers above the surface of the Earth, the force acting on it is not constant throughout the motion. See Figure 13.14. The acceleration of gravity may be computed for a distance xabove the Earth as Acceleration of gravity at altitude x= 9:8\u00a3R2 (R+x)2(13.17) where R:= 6;370 kilometers is the radius of the Earth. We partition the interval [0, 20,000] into 4 equal subintervals and assume the acceleration of gravity to be constant on each of the subintervals. We introduce a new procedure: Choose the value of the acceleration of gravity for each subinterval to be the value at the midpoint of the interval. Thus the midpoint of the \u00afrst interval, [0, 5000] is 2500 and the gravity constant for the \u00afrst 5000 kilometers of motion will be 9:8\u00a363702 (6370 + 2500)2= 5:05 The work to lift the instrument the \u00afrst 5000 kilometers is approximately 5:05\u00a33\u00a35000 = 75814 Newton-meters a.Approximate the total work to lift the instrument to 20,000 km. b.Approximate the total work done to lift the 3 kg instrument 40,000 km.

It is a very interesting question as to whether the instrument can `escape from the Earth's gravity \u00afeld' with a \u00afnite amount of work. We will return to the question in Section 15.5.1, Escape Velocity.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 623 13.4 The Integral We have used upper and lower rectangles to approximate areas between the graphs of functions and the horizontal axis. Other rectangular sums often give better estimates, but in most cases rectangular sums give acceptable estimates. In addition to areas, the approximating sums approximate other important physical and biological quantities, generally representing the accumulation of some quantity that is occurring at a variable rate. Implicit in all of the examples is that better approximations will be computed when the total interval is partitioned into smaller intervals. The total accumulation is called theintegral of a function fon an interval [ a; b]. A short de\u00afnition of the integral is De\u00afnition 13.4.1 The integral of a function, I. Suppose fis a function de\u00afned on an interval [ (13.18) if The notation for the integral is Zb af or as in most calculus booksZb af(t)dt The function, f, is k=1\" f(a+k\u00a3b\u00a1a n)\u00a3b\u00a1a the integral. De\u00afnition 13.4.1 is a formalization of the computations of the previous sections. The lim n!1 provides for the better approximations with smaller intervals in the partitions. right endpoint of thekthinterval.nX k=1f(a+k\u00a3b\u00a1a n)\u00a3b\u00a1a n sums the value of fat the right endpoint times the length of the interval. After discussion of notation, we will apply De\u00afnition 13.4.1 to relatively more di\u00b1cult functions than we have considered so far. Concerning the notations,Rb afandRb af(t)dt. ThedtinRb af(t)dtis often a mystery to students, for good reason. The two notations for an integral in De\u00afnition 13.4.1 can be compared as follows.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 624 Forf(t) =t21\u00b7t\u00b73, one may write Z3 1f 1t2dt : one to de\u00afne the integrand f(t) =t2and write the integral, all with one symbol. However,R3 1t2would do that as well, so what is the dt? One could try to avoid the central problem by discussing Z3 0ek t2dt and say that dtspeci\u00afes that tis the independent variable (and not k). In fact, dtis read `with respect to t.' The symbolRb af(t)dtis read, 'the integral from atoboffoftwith respect to t.' Furthermore, if you use a calculator or computer calculus package to computeR3 0ek t2dtyou have to specify that the integration is with respect to t(and not with respect to k). We will also \u00afnd that dtis useful for keeping track of symbols in a change of variable in the integrand, and in doing so, dtis sometimes called a `di\u00aeerential.' But there is a very colorful and controversial history of the symbol dt. We discuss it in the context of area. According to some, dtis an in\u00afnitesimal length on the t-axis, f(t)dtis an in\u00afnitesimal area under the graph of f, andRb af(t)dtsums the in\u00afnitesimal areas under the graph of ffrom atobto give the total area under the graph of fbetween aandb. We will not attempt an elaboration. Many people use such intuitive language to quickly move from a physical problem to an integral that computes the solution to the physical problem. For example, if P(v) is the pressure in a syringe when the volume is v, then P(v)dvis the `in\u00afnitesimal work' done when the plunger is moved and 'in\u00afnitesimal distance', dx, and the volume changes by an `in\u00afnitesimal volume', dv, and the total work done in moving from v= 60 tov= 20 isR20 50P(v)dv. If the concept of an in\u00afnitesimal seems vague and questionable, you have good company. After Newton had described calculus in Principia , a noted philosopher, Bishop Berkeley, objected strenuously to the concept of dt, writing, \\What are these \u00b0uxions? The velocities of evanescent increments. And what are these same evanescent increments? They are neither \u00afnite quantities nor quantities in\u00afnitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them ghosts of departed quantities?\"5 In order to clear up some of the ambiguities, Augustin Cauchy in 1823 introduced the de\u00afnition of integral we show in De\u00afnition . The notationRb af(t)dthelps keep track of the units of dimension on the integral. If, for example, f(t) is the velocity of a particle, the factor ( b\u00a1a)=nin the approximating sum will have units of time, 5A good source of this debate is in Philip J. Davis and Reuben Hersh, The Mathematical Experience , Houghton Mi\u00b2in Co., Boston, 1982.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 625 f(a+k\u00a3b\u00a1a n)\u00a3(b\u00a1a)=nwill have units of distance, and the approximating sum and the integral will have units of distance. InRb af(t)dt,dtcan be considered to have units of time so that f(t)dthas units of distance andRb af(t)dthas units of distance. Example 13.4.1 The answers to examples and exercises of sections 13.1 through 13.3 all may be expressed in terms of integrals: 1.The area of the region bounded by the graphs of y=f(t)\u00b80,y= 0,t=aandt=bisRb af(t)dt. 2.The mass of a body of density D(x) and cross sectional area A(x) along an interval [ a; b] isRb aD(x)\u00a3A(x)dx. 3.The work done by the heart beat isRe bR(t)\u00a3P(t)dtwhere Ris aortic \u00b0ow rate andPis pressure in the left ventricle. The units on this integral are R(t)ml sec\u00a31cm3 ml\u00a3P(t)N cm2\u00a3dtsec = N-cm which is a unit of work. Had the units not been of work, we would think that the integral is incorrectly formulated. 4.Atmospheric density at altitude hmeters is approximately 1 :225e\u00a10:000101 hkg/m3for 0\u00b7a\u00b75000.

There are some functions for which either the limits in De\u00afnitions I and II are di\u00aeerent or do not exist. It is unlikely that you will encounter one in undergraduate study, and we will not discuss them. We will assume that for all functions we deal with, the limits in De\u00afnitions I and II exist and are the same. For such functions, we say the the integral exists and we say the functions are integrable. Exercises for Section 13.4, The Integral.

Property 13.5.1 Linearity of the integral. Suppose fandgare inte- grable functions de\u00afned on an interval intuitive. If fis the rate of production of urea and gis the rate of production of creatinine, then f+gis the rate of production of nitrogenous waste products. The total production of nitrogenous waste products (Rb a(f(t) +g(t))dt) is the sum of the total production of urea (Rb af(t)dt) and the total production of creatinine (Rb ag(t)dt). If the rate of production of urea is changed by a factor of c, then the total production of urea (Rb ac\u00a3f(t)dt) isctimes the previous production of urea (Rb af(t)dt). The word linear is associated with these two properties, because linear functions of the form P(x) =m\u00a3xhave the is not linear, despite the e\u00aeorts of many students. For most values of xandy sin(x+y)6= sin( x) + sin( y): Compare this with the trigonometric identity sin(x+y) = sin( x) cos( y) + cos( x) sin(y) The reasons the integral has the two linearity properties is that the approximating sum also has the two properties. The integral being the limit of the approximating sums inherits the linearity properties of the approximating sums. For example, if fandgare functions de\u00afned on an interval [ a; and sum forRb af(t)dt.Cornette and A:Z1 0h t2+ti dt= 2\u00a32 = 4 Although many students think otherwise, it is not always (or even usually) true that Zb a[f(t)\u00a3g(t)]dt=Zb af(t)dt\u00a3Zb Also, it is not always true (and it is not even usually true) more properties of the integral are: Property 13.5.2 Geometry of the integral. 1.Suppose fis an integrable function de\u00afned on an interval af(t)dt (13.25)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 635 A a c bf B a bfg C a b a+c B.

Then Zb+c a+cf(t\u00a1c)dt=Zb af(t)dt (13.27) We refer to these as geometric properties because they are so obvious from the area interpretation of the integral. In Figure 13.15 A, it is clear that the area under the graph of fbetween t=aandt=bis the sum of the area between t=aandt=cand the area between t=candt=b. In Figure 13.15, B, it is clear that the area under the graph of fis less than the area under the graph of g. In Figure 13.15, C, the region below the graph of g(t) =f(t\u00a1c) is a simple translation of the region under the graph of f and the areas are equal. Formal proofs of the properties based on approximating sums can be given, but the geometry alone is convincing, and we omit the formal proofs.

There are instances when one wants to extend the integral concept to the case b < a and even the case a=b. This is done by De\u00afnition 13.5.1 Suppose fis andZa af(t)dt= 0 It has been implicit in much of the discussion that f(x) is positive for all xin [a; b]. This is not required, and a number of instances suggest using functions with negative values. Example 13.5.2 For example, a ball thrown vertically may have a positive velocity as it ascends, but will then have a negative velocity as it descends. If one throws the ball with a vertical velocity of 19.6m=s, then the velocity tseconds later will be 19 :6\u00a19:8t m=s where the term 9 :8tis the change in velocity due to gravity. A graph of the velocity is shown in Figure 13.16. Att= 2 seconds the velocity is zero, the ball is at its maximum height, and that height is the area of the triangle marked '+' in Figure 13.16. Between t= 2 and t= 4 seconds the velocity is negative, the motion of the ball is downward and the displacement is the area of the triangle marked '-' in Figure 13.16. At t= 4 the ball has fallen to its original starting point. The net displacement is zero and that isR4 0v(t)dt, the sum of the 'areas' of the two triangles treating the area of the second triangle as negative (see Exercise 13.5.9).

Used http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary artery catheter placed by Chikumaya. 13.6 Cardiac Output The problems of this section are directed to understanding a procedure used for measuring cardiac output. Brie\u00b0y, the procedure is Infuse a quantity, Q, of 0\u00b1Csaline solution into the right side of the heart, and measure the temperature of the \u00b0uid in the pulmonary artery exiting from the heart as a function of time, T(t). Then the \u00b0ow rate is F=Q R1 037\u00a1T(t) 37\u00a10dt(13.29) Our goal is to understand why Equation 13.29 correctly gives the \u00b0ow rate. The following material describes the physiology and is copied from R.A. Rhoades and G. A. Tanner, Medical Physiology. , Little, Brown and Company, 1995, pp 271-2. The Thermodilution Method. In most clinical situations, cardiac output is measured using a variation of the dye dilution method called thermodilution . ASwan-GanzCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 639 catheter (a soft, \u00b0ow-directed catheter with a balloon at the tip) is placed into a large vein and threaded through the right atrium and ventricle so that its tip lies in the pulmonary artery. The catheter is designed so a known amount of ice-cold saline solution can be injected into the right side of the heart via a side pore in the catheter. This solution decreases the temperature of the surrounding blood. The magnitude of the decrease in temperature depends on the volume of blood that mixes with the solution, which depends on cardiac output. A thermistor on the catheter tip (located downstream in the pulmonary artery) measures the fall in blood temperature. Using calculations similar to the dye dilution method, the cardiac output can be determined. Measurement of cardiac output as just described is a common procedure in hospitals. Patients returning from cardiac surgery have a Swan-Ganz catheter inserted as described. Measurements of cardiac output may be made hourly for the \u00afrst 24 hours, followed by measurements every 2 hours for the next two days. You will \u00afnd the web site of a catheter manufacturer, Edwards Lifesciences, interesting. A useful \u00afrst step in understanding Equation 13.29 is to check the units on the left and right hand side. The units on the integral are the same as the units on the approximating sums for the integral. It is reasonable to assume that the \u00b0ow rate, F, is measured in ml/sec so that the right hand side should also have units of ml/sec. The quantity, Q, should be measured in ml. A general approximating sum for the integral in the denominator is nX k=137\u00a1T(tk) 37\u00a110(tk\u00a1tk\u00a11) The fraction37\u00a1T(tk) 37\u00a110is the ratio of temperatures, and is therefore dimensionless. The factor ( tk\u00a1tk\u00a11) is measured in seconds, so that the unit on the approximating sum is seconds, as is the unit on the integral. Therefore the units on both sides of Equation 13.29 are ml/sec. In order to understand the Equation 13.29 it is necessary to understand \\The magnitude of the decrease in temperature depends on the volume of blood that mixes with the solution, which depends on cardiac output. \" and the next few examples and exercises are directed to that end. Example 13.6.1 Suppose 10 ml of 9\u00b1Cwater is mixed with 60 ml of 37\u00b1Cwater. What will be the temperature of the mixture? We base our answer on the concept of heat content in the \u00b0uids measured with a base of zero heat content at 0\u00b1C. It is helpful for this example that the speci\u00afc heat of water is 1 calorie per gram-degree C. The de\u00afnition of a calorie is the amount of heat required to raise one gram of water one degree centigrade | speci\u00afcally from 14.5 to 15.5 degrees centigrade, but we will assume it is constant over the range 0 to 37 degrees centigrade). The following table is helpful: Vol (ml) Temp (\u00b1C) Calories Fluid 1 10 8 10 \u00a39 = 90 Fluid 1 60 37 60 \u00a337 = 2220 Mixture 70 T 70\u00a3TCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 640 The critical step now is the conservation of energy. The calories in the mixture should be the sum of the calories in the two \u00b0uids (we assume there is no heat of mixing) so that 70\u00a3T= 90 + 2220 T= 33\u00b1C Care must be taken when mixing two \u00b0uids of di\u00aeerent heat capacities. If 10 ml of 9\u00b1Ccream is mixed with 60 ml of 37\u00b1Cco\u00aeee, the temperature of the mixture would be slightly less than 33\u00b1because the speci\u00afc heat of cream is greater than that of co\u00aeee (it takes more calories to increase 1 gm of cream 1\u00b1 than it takes to increase 1 gm of co\u00aeee 1\u00b1), and the density of cream is greater than the density of co\u00aeee. Suppose v1ml of \u00b0uid 1 at temperature T1and speci\u00afc heat C1are with of \u00b0uid 2 at temperature T2and speci\u00afc heat C2. The temperature of the mixture will be Tmixture =v1C1T1+v2C2T2 v1C1+v2C2(13.30) We now turn to the problem of measuring cardiac output. Suppose Qml of 0\u00b1Csaline solution are infused into the right side of the heart and the temperature T(t) in the pulmonary artery is measured. Assume that the heat capacity of saline solution is the same as the heat capacity of blood and that \u00b0ow rate past the thermometer is a constant, F. The concentration of saline solution at the thermometer is K(t) =37\u00a1T(t) 37\u00a10 The amount of saline solution that passes the thermometer in time interval end of measurement and label it as 1. Then the amount of saline solution that passes the thermometer must also be Q, the amount injected. We can write Q=F\u00a3Z1 037\u00a1T(t) 37\u00a10dt; and F=Q Z1 037\u00a1T(t) 37\u00a10dt: Exercises for Section 13.6, Cardiac Output.

Shown in Figure 13.18 are graphs of the relative energy absorption of chlorophylls aandb9. Which of the two chlorophylls absorb the most energy? Light energy, E, is related to wave length, \u00b8, by the relation E=K \u00b8 where Kis a constant. Case 1. We \u00afrst assume that the light intensity from the sun is constant, I, for all frequencies within the visible spectrum (so the the energy from a wave length, \u00b8, would be I\u00a3K \u00b8 and compute the energy absorbed by chlorophyll b(the similar problem for chlorophyll ais an exercise). (Does chlorophyll aabsorb in the uv range?) We partition the visible spectrum (400 nm to 700 nm) into intervals with smaller intervals where the graph changes rapidly. (in the interval 400 to 500 nm and in the interval 575 to 650). Shown in 9The graph is copied from Peter H. Raven and George B.

Exercise 13.7.3 Compute (approximately) the relative energy absorbed by chlorophyll aover the visible spectrum from 400 to 700 nm.Chapter 14 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Where are we going? You have studied the two primitive concepts of calculus, the derivative and the integral. They are based on the notion of limit, but each con- cept has been de\u00afned without reference to the other. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus de\u00afnes the relation between the derivative and the integral, and shows that each operation is the inverse of the other. A powerful method of evaluating integrals is a result. 14.1 An Example. LetAbe the function de\u00afned by A(x) =Zx 0sin(t)dt for 0 \u00b7x\u00b7\u00bc 2 Then for xin [0, \u00bc=2],A(x) is the area of the region bounded by the graphs of y= sin t y = 0 and t=x (see Figure 14.1A). We have two goals. Goal I. Show that for any x, 0\u00b7x\u00b7\u00bc=2, A0(x) = sin( x) Goal II. Suggest (and it is actually true) that A(x) =\u00a1cos(x) + 1 Goal I. A0(x) = sin( x). We will show that the right hand derivative, A0+(x) = lim h!0+A(x+h)\u00a1A(x) h= sin( x) for 0 \u00b7x < \u00bc= 2: A similar argument shows that the left hand derivative, A0\u00a1(x) = sin xfor 0 < x\u00b7\u00bc=2, so that A0(x) = sin xon 0\u00b7x\u00b7\u00bc=2. 646Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 647 A 000.20.40.60.81 y = sin(t) ty A(x) 14.1: A.

The height of R1is sin( x) and the width is h, so the Area of R1is sin( x)\u00a3h (14.2) In Figure 14.2B is a rectangle, R2, that entirely contains Rand the area of R2is greater than the area of R. The height of R2is sin( x+h) and the width is h, so the Area of R2is sin( x+h)\u00a3h (14.3) A 000.20.40.60.81 y = sin(t) x)\u00a3h. B. Rectangle R2of area (sin( x+h) )\u00a3h. We conclude from Area of R1<Area of R < Area of R2Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 648 and from Equations 14.1 to 14.3 that (remember, h sin(x)(14.4) from which it follows that A0+(x) = sin( x) for 0 \u00b7x <\u00bc 2 The three limits, a., b. and c. in Equation 14.4 are important. Limit a. is valid because sin xis independent of h. Limit b. is the de\u00afnition of the righthand derivative, A0+. Limit c. is correct because sinxis continuous at x, which is shown in Exercise 7.1.4. Our argument has assumed that h >0 and 0 \u00b7x < \u00bc= 2. Simple modi\u00afcations of the argument imply thatA0\u00a1(x) = sin xfor 0 < x\u00b7\u00bc=2. so that A0(x) = sin xfor 0 < x < \u00bc= 2. The domain of Ais [0; \u00bc=2], and by de\u00afnition A0(0) = A0+(0) = sin 0 and A0(\u00bc=2) = A0\u00a1(\u00bc=2) = sin \u00bc=2. Goal I has been met. Goal II. A(x) =\u00a1cos(x) + 1. We know that A0(x) = sin( x). Derivative formulas will yield [\u00a1cos(x)]0= sin( x): Thus A(x) and\u00a1cos(x) have the same derivative, sin( x). We might think, then, that because A(x) and \u00a1cos(x) have the same derivative, they must be the same functions. That is too strong because constant functions have derivative = 0, and, for example, [\u00a1cos(x) + 13]0= sin( x); also. But we can conclude (as we will see in Theorem 14.3.2) that there is \u00a1cos(0) + C 0 = \u00a11 +C C= 1 Therefore A(x) =\u00a1cos(x) + 1 Goal II has been met.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 649 Note that A\u00b5\u00bc 2\u00b6 = 1\u00a1cos\u00b5\u00bc 2\u00b6 = 1: Therefore the area of the region shown in Figure 14.3 bounded by the graphs of y= sin( t) y= 0 and t=\u00bc 2 is 1. By this process, the area was found to be 1 without reference to approximating sums . Using the limit of approximating sums, this region also was found to have area 1 in Example 13.4.4. 000.20.40.60.81 y = sin(t) ty /2 /4Area = 1 Figure 14.3: The region bounded by the graph of y= sin x,y= 0 and t=\u00bc=2. In this chapter we give arguments for more general results, but the stepping stones for all of them are those we have just shown. 14.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Theorem 14.2.1 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Suppose fis a continuous function de\u00afned on an interval [ a; b] and Gis the function de\u00afned for every xin [a; b] by G0(x) =f(x) Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. We prove the theorem for the case that fis increasing. Suppose fis an increasing and continuous function de\u00afned on [ a; and for each xin [a; b], G(x) =Rx af(t)dt. We will prove that the hand derivative G0+(x) = lim h!0+G(x+h)\u00a1G(x) h=f(x) for a\u00b7x < b:Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 650 A simple modi\u00afcation of the argument shows that G0\u00a1(x) =f(x) for a < x \u00b7b, so that for a\u00b7x\u00b7b.

Because f(x) is not a\u00aeected by h,f(x) remains \u00afxed as hgets close to zero. However:Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 651 Explore 14.2.2 Do This.

A slight modi\u00afcation of this argument shows that G0\u00a1(x) =f(x) for a < x \u00b7b. and we conclude that G0(x) =f(x) for a < x < b and G0(b) =G0\u00a1(b),G0(x) =f(x) for a\u00b7x\u00b7b. Slightly modi\u00afed arguments yield the same conclusion for fa decreasing function. End of proof. Example 14.2.1 Although technical in statement, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus agrees with your intuition. 1.Ifv(t) is the velocity of a particle at time t, then G(x) =Rx 0v(t)dtis the displacement of the particle during the time interval [0 ; x]. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that G0(x), the rate of change of displacement, is v(x), the velocity. 2.Ifr(t) is the rate at which urea is produced in a patient without functional kidneys, then G(x) =Rx 0r(t)dtis the total amount of urea in the body xhours since the last dialysis. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that G0(x), the rate of change of total urea, is r(x), the rate at which it is produced. 3.Ifb(t) and d(t) are the birth and death rates of a population at time t, then r(t) =b(t)\u00a1d(t) is the growth rate (which may be negative). G(x) =Rx 0r(t)dtis the population increase (again, it could be negative) during the time interval [0 ; x]. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that G0(x), the rate of change of population, is r(x), the growth rate. 4.In Example Figure 14.2.1.1, for 1 \u00b7x\u00b74, let G(x) be the area of the region bounded by the graph off, the t-axis, and the lines t= 1 and t=x.

The Parallel Graph Theorem is needed in order to make full use of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. A preliminary version is the Horizontal Graph Theorem. Theorem 14.3.1 Horizontal Graph Theorem. If Dis a continuous function de\u00afned on an interval [ a; b] and for every number xin (a; b), D0(x) = 0 then there is a number that every number xin LetC=D(a). Suppose b). By the Mean Value Theorem 9.1.1 there is a number z between aandxsuch that D(x)\u00a1D(a) =D0(z)\u00a3(x\u00a1a): Because D(x)\u00a1D(a) = =D(a) =C. D(x) =Cfor every xin [a; b),D(b) =C. End of proof. An example of parallel graphs, that is, graphs which have the same derivative, is shown in Figure 14.5.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 656 Theorem 14.3.2 Parallel Graph Theorem. IfFandGare functions de\u00afned on an for every xin [a; b] F0(x) =G0(x) then there is a number, xin [a; b] = [F(x)\u00a1G(x)]0=F0(x)\u00a1G0(x) = 0 for every [a; b]. By the Horizontal Graph Theorem, Theorem 14.3.1, there number Csuch that for F(x) =G(x) proof. The power of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus augmented by the Parallel Graph Theorem is illustrated by the next example. Example 14.3.1 A 10cc syringe has cross-sectional area Acm2; air inside the plunger is atmospheric pressure P0; the plunger is a the 10 cc mark and the neck of the syringe is blocked. The plunger is depressed a distance s=Ato the 10 \u00a1scc mark; the pressure, Ps, inside the syringe is P0\u00a310=(10\u00a1s). The force on the plunger is ( Ps\u00a1P0)\u00a3A=A\u00a3P0\u00a3(s=(10\u00a1s). The work done in compressing the air from 10 cc to 5 work done in compressing the air is W(5). The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus asserts that W0(x) =P0x 10\u00a1x Let!(x) be !(x) =P0[\u00a110 ln(10 \u00a1x)\u00a1x] =!0(x) for every xin [0;5], and by the Parallel Graph Theorem there is a number C such that such that for every number xin [0;5] W(x) =!(x) +CCornette and Ackerman, !(0) + C 0 =\u00a1P0\u00a310 ln 10 + C and C=P0\u00a310 ln 10 : We can conclude that [0;5] W(x) =P0[\u00a110 ln(10 \u00a1x)\u00a1x] +P010 ln(10)] The total the air as W(5) = P0[\u00a110 ln(10 \u00a15)\u00a15 + 10 ln(10)] = P0\u00a31:93 In the previous example, we used the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the integral without computing an approximating sum . It was important to have a function, !, satisfying !0=W0, and in a sense, the problem of computing approximating sums was exchanged for the problem of \u00afnding !. Once we found such an !, we appealed to the Parallel Graph Theorem to conclude that there was a number Csuch that for all x,W(x) =!(x) +C. Exercises for Section 14.3 The parallel graph theorem.

There is an initial burst of insulin secretion that may last 5-15 minutes, a result of secretion of preformed insulin secretory granules. This is followed by more gradual and sustained insulin secretion that results largely from biosynthesis of new insulin molecules. \" (Rhoades and Tanner, p710) a.A student eats a candy bar at 10:20 am.

Because the problem, \\Find F(t) such that F0(t) =f(t)\" occurs with each application of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus II, extensive tabulations of solutions to the problem (called antiderivatives orinde\u00afnite integrals ) have been made during the 300 years since calculus was \u00afrst introduced. I. S. Gradsteyn and I. W. Ryzhik list some 2000 - 2500 antiderivatives in their \\Table of Integrals Series and Products\", Academic Press, 1965. More recently, computer programs have been written that provide a rich supply of antiderivatives (Mathematica, Derive, Maple) and some hand held calculators will solve most of the commonly encountered problems (HP-48, TI-92). The antiderivatives are denoted byZ f(t)dt and are called inde\u00afnite integrals because the interval of integration is not speci\u00afed (there are no lower and upper limits of integration). Because the derivative of a constant function is zero, every inde\u00afnite integral is really a set of functions, each two members of which di\u00aeer by a constant. The common notation always includes an additive constant in the solution. For example, Z x2dx=x3 3+C (14.7) is read, `the inde\u00afnite integral of x2isx3 3+C' where it is understood that Cis a constant. The implication is that every function whose derivative is x2is of the form,x3 3+C. For every derivative formula, there is an inde\u00afnite integral (antiderivative) formula. There follows a table of inde\u00afnite integral formulas corresponding to the derivative formulas on page 389. Z 0dt=C (14.8) Z 1dt=t+C (14.9) Z tndt=tn+1 n+ 1+C kekt+C (14.24) An easy aspect of antiderivative formulas is that they can be checked readily by di\u00aeerentiation. For example, Equation 14.10 asserts that all functions whose derivative is tnare of the formtn+1 n+1+C. We can check that all such functions have 1)tn+ 0 Equation 8.15 =tn: That there are no other such functions is a consequence of the Parallel Graph Theorem. The inde\u00afnite integral formulas enable computation of antiderivatives of all polynomials; in fact,Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 664 only four of the antiderivative formulas are needed. For example R[5t7\u00a13t4+ 2]dt=R[5t7]dt\u00a1R[3t4]dt+R2dt 2t+C: The constant terms included in the antiderivatives are usually suppressed until the last step, and are treated as rather pliable objects. For example, Cin the last equation above is 5 C1\u00a13C2+ 2C3. Because a linear combination of constants is just a constant, and because subscripts are a nuisance, one often sees algebraic steps that would imply 5C\u00a13C+ 2C=C: Students usually adapt to this murky algebra without su\u00aeering serious damage, but it seems only fair to warn you of this practice, as we will will follow it subsequently. 14.5.1 Using the chain rules. Equations 14.18 through 14.23 are all consequences of a chain rule for derivatives and always when using one of these equations it is important to identify u(t),G0(u),u0(t) and G(u). Example 14.5.1 Two antiderivative problems that andZ et2t dt are peculiarly di\u00aeerent. The \u00afrst has no expression in familiar terms. The second is easy. In the second equation, identify u(t) =t2; G0(u) =eu; August 12, 2010 665 Example 14.5.2 Consider solving the two problems Z\u00b3 1 +t4\u00b410t3dt orZ\u00b3 1 +t4\u00b410t2dt Because (1 + t4)10can be expanded by multiplication (using either the binomial expansion formula or by making nine multiplications) and the expanded form is a polynomial, both integrands of these two problems are polynomials and the antiderivatives of polynomials can be easily computed. The \u00afrst integral can be solved without expansion, however, and is easier to compute. Identify u(t) = 1 1 + t4 Students sometimes attempt to solveR(1 +t4)10t2dtby the following means. They are thinking of u(t) = 1 + t4; incorrect because1 4tis not a constant. The corresponding step in the previous argument is correct because1 4is a constant and Equation 14.15 asserts thatRK\u00a3f(t)dt=K\u00a3Rf(t)dtwhen K is a constant. It is incorrect when Kis not constant. Example 14.5.3 ComputeRsin(\u00bct)dt. Identify ComputeRtanx dx. This is a good one. First write Z tanx dx=Zsinx cosxdxCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 667 cos an antiderivative has been computed, it can be checked by di\u00aeerentiation. We check the last claim thatRtanx= ln sec x+Cby di\u00aeerentiation. We should show that [ x. [ ln sec x]0=1 secx[secx]0 =1 secxsecxtanx = tan [f0(t)\u00a3g(t) +f(t)\u00a3g0(t)]dt=f(t)\u00a3g(t) +C is usually rewritten asZ (14.25) Equation 14.25 exchanges the problem,Rf(t)\u00a3g0(t)dtfor the problemRf0(t)\u00a3g(t)dt. There are times when that is a good trade, but some cleverness is required to recognize when a good trade is possible. The process is called integration by parts, f(t) and g0(t) being the parts in the \u00afrst integral and f0(t) andg(t) being the parts in the second integral. In computingRt\u00a3sint dt, there is a good trade. Identify f(t) = tand g0(t) = sin t f0(t) = 1 g(t) = \u00a1costCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 668 Then Rt\u00a3sint dt =t\u00a3(\u00a1cost)\u00a1R1\u00a3(\u00a1cost)dt =\u00a1tcost+ sin t+C In computingRt2\u00a3sint dt, two good trades can be made. First we identify f(t) = t2and g0(t) = sin t f0(t) = 2 t g (t) = \u00a1cost ThenRt2\u00a3sint dt =t2\u00a3(\u00a1cost)\u00a1R2t\u00a3(\u00a1cost)dt Next we identify f(t) = f0(t) 2\u00a3(cost) +C A chart to keep track of these computations is shown in Figure 14.6. You may see from the chart how to computeRt2\u00a3cost dtandRt3\u00a3sint dtandRt3etdt. Exercises for Section 14.5, Integral Formulas.

Several of the traditional applications of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and a de\u00afnition of integrals of functions of two variables are included in this chapter. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus II, symbolically written Zb aF0(t)dt=F(b)\u00a1F(a) = [ F(t) ]b a=F(t)jb a; (15.1) replaces tedious computations of the limit of sums of rectangular areas with an often easier problem of \u00afnding an antiderivative. The theorem is widely applied in physics and chemistry and engineering. It is useful in biology, but less widely so because the integrands, f(t), often are not expressed as elementary functions. Indeed, the integrands in biology may be only partly speci\u00afed as tables of data, in which case the options are to (1) compute a rectangular or trapezoidal sum or (2) approximate the data with an elementary function (a polynomial, for example) and compute the integral of the elementary function using Equation 15.1. 15.1 Volume. Example 15.1.1 How to \u00afnd the volume of a potato. A potato is pictured in Figure 15.1A with marks along an axis at 2 cm intervals. A cross section of the potato at position 10 cm showing an area of approximately 17 cm2is pictured in Figure 15.1B. The volume of the slice between stations 8 cm and 10 cm is approximately 2 cm \u00a317 cm2= 34 cm3. There are 9 slices. The volume of the potato is approximately 9X k=1( Area of slice kin cm2)\u00a32 cm. 672Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 673 A B Figure 15.1: A. A potato with 2 cm marks along an axis. B. A slice of the potato at position x= 10 that has area approximately 17 cm2.\u00be x- 0 4 8 12 16A(x) The approximation works remarkably well. Several students have computed approximate volumes and subsequently tested the volumes with liquid replacement in a beaker and found close agreement. The sum is also an approximation to the integral Z17 0A(x)dx which may be considered to be the actual volume. The principle applies to any three dimensional region, R. Assume there is an axis Land for each station xbetween stations aandbalong the axis, the area A(x) of the cross section of Rperpendicular toLatxis known. Then Volume of R=Zb aA(x)dx (15.2) Using this procedure, volumes of a large number of regions can be computed. Example 15.1.2 The volume of a sphere. Consider a sphere with radius Rand center at the origin of three dimensional space. We will compute the volume of the hemisphere between x= 0 and x=R. See Figure 15.2A. Suppose xis between 0 and R. The cross section of the region at xis a circle of radius r and area \u00bcr2. Therefore r2+x2=R2; r2=R2\u00a1x2and A=A(x) = \u00bc(R2\u00a1x2): Consequently the volume of the hemisphere is V=ZR 0\u00bc(R2\u00a1x2)dx The integral is the integral of a polynomial, and Z \u00bc(R2\u00a1x2)dx=Z (\u00bcR2\u00a1\u00bcx2)dx=\u00bcR2x\u00a1\u00bcx3 3+C: By the A(x)r xR B 0 1 2012301234 A(z) 3y x 24 z Figure 15.2: A.

Find the volume of the solid Sgenerated by rotating the region Rbetween y=x2andy=px about the x-axis. See Figure 15.3B. Solution. There are two problems here. First we compute the volume of the solid, S1, generated by rotating the region below y=px, 0\u00b7x\u00b71, about the x-axis. Then we subtract the volume of the solid, S2, generated by rotating y=x2, 0\u00b7x\u00b71 about 5=3\u00bc 10 Alternatively, we can compute the area the 'washer' at xwhich is A(x) 676 Exercises for Section 15.1, Volume Exercise 15.1.1 Data for all of the slices of the potato shown in Figure 15.1 are: Slice Position (cm) 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Slice Area (cm2) 11 15 14 16 17 15 13 10 Approximate the volume of the potato.

Include only the brain and not the membrane which is apparent as white tissue. We found it useful to make a 5mm grid on clear plastic (the cover of a CD box), each square of which would be equivalent to 4 cm2. The average human brain volume is 1450 cm3.

Center of mass is an important concept to students of biomechanics, the study of the movement of animals including walking, running, skating, diving. For an ice skater who performs a jump, the path of her center of mass will be a parabola. The center of mass of a walker moves up and down with each stride, thus expending energy; the minimum energy per distance traveled is expended when walking approximately 3 mph1. In walking the center of mass reaches its highest point at the center of the stance (when the two feet are together) and in running the center of mass reaches its lowest point at the center of the stance2. Through what point of a potato might you push a slender rod so that the potato would be balanced on that rod? If a collection of masses m1,m2,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2,mnis distributed at positions x1,x2,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2,xnalong a rod (of negligible mass) and cis a point of the rod, then the moment of the masses about cis Moment of cfor which the moment is zero is the center of mass of the system. Equation 15.8 can be solved for that value of c. nX k=1mk\u00a3(xk\u00a1c) = 0 1T. F. Novocheck, Gait and Posture, 7 (1998), 77-95 2C. R. Lee and C. T. Farley, J. of Experimental.

We picture the cone as the solid of revolution obtained by rotating the graph of y= 3/4 the distance from the vertex of the cone and 1/4 the distance from the base of the cone. Example 15.3.2 Problem. Suppose a \u00b0at plate of thickness 1 and uniform density has a horizontal outline bounded by the graph of y=x2,y= 1, and x= 4. Where is the centroid of the plate.

Solution. There are two problems here. The \u00afrst is, 'What is the x-coordinate, x, of the centroid'; the second is, 'What is the y-coordinate, y, of the centroid?' The z-coordinate of the centroid is one-half the thickness, z= 1=2.

The surface area to volume ratio limits the size of cells. The surface areas of the lungs and the small intestine determines, respectively, the oxygen absorbance and nutrient absorbance in humans. We will compute surface areas only for surfaces of revolution. We use the fact that the surface area of the frustum of a cone (illustrated in Figure 15.8A) is Area of frustum of a cone = \u00bc(r1+r2)s1Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 690 A s1s2 r1r2 h1h2 B 00 s2s1 Figure of a cone; r1,r2, and h1determine the cone.

The proof is left to you, and you may be assisted by Figure 15.8B in which the frustum has been cut along a slant side and \u00b0attened. The angle \u00b5= 2\u00bcr1=(s1+s2) = 2 \u00bcr2=s2.

Therefore we write Surface Area =Zb a2\u00bcf(x)q 1 + ( f0(x) )2dx (15.13) Again the an antiderivativeR2\u00bcf(x)q 1 + ( f0(x) )2dxcan be found is small. Fortunately one such function is f(x) =p R2\u00a1x2and the surface area is that of a sphere, 4 \u00bcR2, which appears in Exercise 15.4.3.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 691 f(xk)f(xk1) xkxk1 Figure 15.9: A surface of revolution with approximating conical frustum.

Another integralZ1 01pxdx; is also said to be improper. The integrand,1pxhas an identity crisis at x= 0; the integrand is not de\u00afned a x= 0 and is unbounded in every interval [0 ; r],r >0.

We borrow from physics the formula for kinetic energy of a body of mass mmoving at a velocity v. Kinetic energy =1 2mv2: Then we equate the kinetic energy with the work required 1 2mv2= 9:8\u00a3m\u00a3R; and solve for v.

We have presented several discrete di\u00aeerence equation models, including Exponential Growth Pt+1\u00a1Pt=R\u00a3Pt Logistic 1\u00a1\u00b3Nt\u00a18 N0\u00b42:39\u00be\u00b8 \u00a10:94Ct We have also presented two continuous time models, Exponential Growth p(0) = p0 = 0 707Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 708 For whale populations that are \u00afnite and have annual births, the discrete time model Nt+1= 0:94Nt+Nt\u00a18\" 0:06 + 0 :0567( 1\u00a1\u00b5Nt\u00a18 N0\u00b62:39)# \u00a10:94Ct is appropriate. Although bacterial populations are \u00afnite, they typically are so numerous and cell division so rapid that continuous time models with instantaneous rates of change describe well bacterial growth. Drug concentrations change continuously with continuous exchange between tissues and the vascular pool and with continuous kidney action, and continuous time models with instantaneous rates of change are preferred. The discrete logistic growth, penicillin clearance, disease spread models may be replaced by continuous time models Logistic Growth p0(t) 0 s0(t) = = 250 r0(t) = \u00b0\u00a3i(t) r(0) = 0 The discrete and continuous rate coe\u00b1cients are related but not equal. For logistic growth, for example, rin the continuous model and Rin the discrete model are related by r= ln(1 + R). Except for the harmonic equation, the derivative equations above are all \u00afrst order di\u00aeerential equations because the \u00afrst derivative and no higher order derivative appears. The harmonic equations y00(t) +!2y(t) = 0 y00(t) + 3y0(t) + 4y(t) = 0 involve the second derivatives and are examples of a second order di\u00aeerential equations. The equations are called di\u00aeerential equations , but would be better named derivative equations because they relate derivatives of functions to the functions. The words di\u00aeerential equation are in universal usage, however, and we will do the same. The expression derives from a frequent practice of writing, for example, the equation y0(t) = 0 :02\u00a3y\u00a3(1\u00a1y 10) (16.1) in Leibnitz notationdy in di\u00aeerential 10)dtCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 709 and \u00afnally even in the form dy y\u00a3(1\u00a1y=10)= 0:02dt We have not de\u00afned the symbols, dyanddt. They are called di\u00aeerentials, and considered to be in\u00afnitesimals; dyis an in\u00afnitesimal change in ydue to an in\u00afnitesimal change, dt, int. Thus, y0is the slope,riserun=dy dt. This concept has been used successfully by many scientist, but has su\u00aeered from philosophical attack on the concept, in\u00afnitesimal. We used the notationRb af(t)dtwithout separate de\u00afnition of dt. We do not do so, but some scientists reason that to integrate fon [a; b], one \\sums the values increases, dt, intfrom t=atot=b.\" 16.1 Di\u00aeerential equation models of biological processes. Di\u00aeerential equations were important early in the development of biological concepts. 16.1.1 Single species population models. Thomas Malthus1described human population growth as Malthus' Model of Population Growth. The rate of population increase is proportional to the size of the population. Letp(t) denote population size at time t. Then Malthus asserted that Rate of is proportional population increase to size Malthus p0(t) = r\u00a3 p(t) From this di\u00aeerential equation we have concluded (Property of Exponential Growth or Decay, 5.5.2) that p(t) =p0ert(p0is founding population size) which is the exponential growth Malthus predicted. Malthus also modeled the increase in food production as Malthus' Model of Food Production. The growth rate of food production is constant. Letf(t) denote the food produced at time t. Then Rate of is constant increase Food Production f0(t) = C 1Anonymous publication in 1898, An essay on the Principle of Population as it A\u00aeects the Future Improvement of Society with Remarks on the Speculations of Mr. Godwin, M. Condorcet, and Other Writers.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 710 We know that if f0(t) =Cthen f(t) =Ct+f0 (f0is initial food production.) Malthus knew that every exponential graph eventually exceeds every linear graph and direly predicted wide spread poverty and degradation, Figure 16.1. Food Production Food Demand Time Figure 16.1: Malthus forecast that food demand would out strip food production. In 1838 and 1845 P. F. Verhulst2connected the population to its environment and asserted that: Mathematical Model of population growth in a limited environment The growth rate of a population is proportional to the size of the population and to the fraction of the carrying capacity unused by the population. By the double proportionality, the growth rate is proportional to the product of the population size and the unused fraction of the carrying capacity. Letp(t) be the size of a population growing in an environment in which the carrying capacity is M. LetU(p(t)) denote the unused fraction of the carrying capacity for population size p(t), and write Growth Is proportional Population Times Unused fraction rate to size of capacity p0(t) = r\u00a3 p(t) \u00a3 U(p(t)) Scientists have written various expression for U(p(t)). Verhulst used the most direct: Fraction of carrying capacity used =p(t) M Unused fraction of carrying capacity U(p(t)) = 1 \u00a1p(t) M 2Pierre F. Verhulst (1838) Notice sur la loi la population pursuit dans son accroissement, Corresondence math\u00b6 ematique et physique 10:113-121; (1845) Nouveau Memoirs de l'Academie Royal des Sciences et Bellas-Letters.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 711 With U(p(t)) = 1 \u00a1p(t) to model \u00afsh populations; the Gompertz equation is used to model tumor growth. In the Verhulst, Ricker and Beverton-Holt equations, when p(t) is close to zero, U(p(t)) is close to 1 and p0(t):=r\u00a3p(t) for p(t) small For that reason, the number ris called the low density growth rate . At low population numbers, population growth in the Verhulst, Ricker and Beverton-Holt models appears to be as Malthus projected. The Gompertz equation is quite di\u00aeerent at low population numbers as will be seen in Explore 16.1.1 but shares a similarity as seen in Exercise 16.1.2. Explore 16.1.1 Low density growth in the Gompertz model is di\u00aeerent from that in the Verhulst, Ricker, and Beverton-Holt models. a.Show that in the Ricker model in Equations 16.3, for p(t)\u00bf\u00af,U(t):= 1 so that p0(t):=r p(t). b.Show that in the Gompertz model for p(t)\u00bf\u00af,U(p(t))\u00c01 so that p0(t)\u00c0r p(t). 16.1.2 Competition between two species. Alfred J. Lotka and Vito Volterra formulated models of competing species and predator prey interactions in the early 1900's3. Two species that occupy a given environment may compete for space, food, or light. They may reach an accommodation in which both species continue, but often one of the species is eventually excluded from the environment, depending on the environmental capacity for each species and the degree to which one species absorbs the resources of the other. Assume that for each species: Mathematical Model of population growth in competition. The growth rate of a population is proportional to the size of the population and to the fraction of the carrying capacity unused by the twopopulations. 3A prime reference is Lotka's 1924 book, Elements of Mathematical Biology now available as a Dover reprint, 1956.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 712 This is the same as for a single species, except for the two. Suppose two competing species have populations p1(t) and p2(t) in an environment with capacities M1andM2respectively for each population in the absence of the other. Similar to the Verhulst model for a single species, for two species we write Population 1 p0 1(t) = a measure of the in\u00b0uence of Population 2 on the environment of Population 1. If a member of Population 2 consumes twice the resources that a member of Population 1 consumes, then \u00ae1;2= 2. A similar interpretation should be given to \u00ae2;1. According to this model, the eventual presence or absence of Populations 1 and 2 depend on the values of M1,M2,\u00ae1;2and\u00ae2;1(and, curiously, not on r1norr2). 16.1.3 Predator-Prey models. Lotka and Verhulst also wrote equations descriptive of predator and prey interaction. We described a model for predator and prey values close to equilibrium on page 326. To extend this model assume Mathematical Model of prey and predator: We assume two species, a prey and a predator, and that The rate of predation is proportional to the size of the prey population and proportional to the size of the predator population. Furthermore: a.Without the predator, the prey population increases at a rate proportional to the size of the prey population (as Malthus predicted). b.The prey growth rate is decreased proportional to the rate of predation. c.Without the prey, the predator decreases at a rate proportional to the size of the predator population (the predator has no alternate food source). d.The predator growth rate is increased proportional to the rate of predation. As usual, the double proportionality of the predation rate implies the the predation rate is proportional to the product of the size of the prey population and the size of the predator population. Letu(t) and v(t) denote the sizes of the prey and predator populations, respectively. We interpret parts 1 and 2 above to say that Prey u0(t) =a\u00a3u(t)\u00a1b\u00a3u(t)\u00a3v(t) (16.5) You are asked to write the Predator equation in Exercise 16.1.8Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 713 16.1.4 Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered (SIR) epidemic models. In 1927 W. O. McKermack and A. G. McKendrick4modeled the spread of contagious diseases based on the assumption that SIR Model of Epidemics. The rate at which people get infected is proportional to the rate of `infections contacts' between already infected people and people who are susceptible of becoming infected. The rate of infections contacts is proportional to the number of susceptible people and to the number of infected people. Suppose people are either susceptible to becoming infected, infected and capable of transmitting the disease, or have been infected and recovered, with numbers S(t),I(t), and R(t), respectively and with t measured in days. Then the basic model is Susceptible S0(t) = \u00a1\u00af\u00a3S(t)\u00a3I(t) Infectious I0(t) = \u00af\u00a3S(t)\u00a3I(t)\u00a1\u00b0\u00a3I(t) Recovered R0(t) = \u00b0\u00a3I(t) 16.1.5 Environmental pollution. Suppose a lake has a river running through it and a factory is built next to the lake and begins releasing a chemical into the lake. The water running into the lake is free of the chemical and initially the lake is free of the chemical. What is the expected future content of the chemical in the lake? We use a simple, but sometimes overlooked, model. Mathematical Model. The rate at which the amount of chemical in the lake increases is equal to the rate at which the chemical enters the lake minus the rate at which the chemical leaves the lake. We also use The rate at which the chemical leaves the lake is the product of the concentration of the chemical in the lake and the rate at which water leaves the lake. To get an equation we need some notation. Let Vmeters3be the volume of the lake. \\A river running through the lake\" means that there is a river running into the lake at a rate of Rm3/day and a river running out of the lake also at a rate of Rm3/day. Assume the factory releases the chemical into the lake at a rate of Tkilograms/day. Finally, let P(t) be the kilograms of chemical in the lake tdays 4W. O. McKermack and A. G.

Initially, the lake is free of the chemical, and at all times the water \u00b0owing into the lake is free of the chemical.

Write an initial condition, P(0) and a di\u00aeerential equation that will model the amount of pollution in the lake. Write a solution to your equation.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 716 Exercise 16.1.14 As the \u00afrst approximation of penicillin clearance by the kidney, we wrote the di\u00aeerence equations P(0) = 10 P(T+ 1)\u00a1P(t) = \u00a10:2\u00a3P(T) Time was measured in 5 minute intervals (so that time t+ 1 was \u00afve minutes later than time, t). The equation re\u00b0ects the assumption that 20% of the penicillin in the serum is removed every 5 minutes. Penicillin clearance is a continuous process, however; is does not occur in 5 minute batches. Write a model of continuous penicillin clearance following a single injection of penicillin. Consider only the vascular pool; we will include the tissue compartment later. Write a di\u00aeerential equation with initial condition that will describe the amount of penicillin in a six liter vascular pool following an injection of 2 grams of penicillin. Note that at time t= 5 minutes the amount of penicillin in the vascular pool is 1.6 g. Exercise 16.1.15 Suppose a patient is administered penicillin by continuous infusion at the rate of 0.5 gm/hour. Consider only the vascular pool, and write a model of penicillin amount in the vascular pool. Write an initial condition and a di\u00aeerential equation that is descriptive of the amount of penicillin in the serum as a function of time. 16.2 Solutions to di\u00aeerential equations. Important biological and physical processes are well described by di\u00aeerential equations. The next few sections are directed to \u00afnding the functions that are described by the di\u00aeerential equations. A general form of the \u00afrst order di\u00aeerential equation is y0(t) =f(t; y(t)) (16.7) where fis a function of two variables, ( t; y). Equation 16.7 is a statement about a function y(t) and a solution to the equation is a function for which the statement is true. We check that it is a solution by substitution . Consider for example the algebraic equation x2\u00a13x+ 2 = 0 which is a statement about a number x. The statement that the number 2 is a solution to the equation means that when 2 is substituted for xin the equation the result is a true statement 22\u00a13\u00a32 + 2 = 4 \u00a16 + 2 = 0 It Checks! Note that x= 1 is also a solution to the algebraic equation. However, x= 5 is not a solution: 52\u00a13\u00a35 + 2 = 25 \u00a115 + 2 = 12 6= 0 It does not Check. An example of a di\u00aeerential equation is y0(t) =t\u00a3y(t)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 not a solution. But we claim that y=et2 2isa solution. Again, we Checks! Explore 16.2.1 Show that each of the functions shown below is a solution to y0(t) another solution to y0(t) =t\u00a3y(t). Show that y=et2is not a solution to y0(t) =t\u00a3y(t). Initial Condition. There are several (actually in\u00afnitely many) solutions to y0(t) =t\u00a3y(t). In addition to the di\u00aeerential equation, one usually also knows an initial condition y(0) (or, y(a), the value ofyat another speci\u00afc value, a, oft). Then for most \u00afrst order di\u00aeerential equations that describe biological and physical processes, there will be only one function that satis\u00afes both the initial condition and the di\u00aeerential equation. For example, suppose y(0) = 2 y0(t) =t\u00a3y(t) Then y(t) = 2 et2=2satis\u00afes both conditions. We check by substitution in both equations. Initial Condition 2010 718 Therefore, y= 2et2=2satis\u00afes the initial condition y(0) = 2 and the di\u00aeerential equation y0(t) =t\u00a3y(t). Conditions that insure that y= 2et2=2is the only solution satisfying both the initial condition and the di\u00aeerential equation are given in Theorem 16.6.1 Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions, but we do not include a proof of this theorem. Exercises for Section 16.2, Solutions to di\u00aeerential equations. Exercise 16.2.1 Show that each solution satis\u00afes the initial condition and the di\u00aeerential equation.

Check by substitution that y(t) =F(t) has therefore been completely solved. Henceforth we will consider that fis dependent on yand possibly also on t. 16.3 Direction Fields. Shown in Figures 16.2 and 16.3 are the graphs of solutions of certain di\u00aeerential equations. For each di\u00aeerential equation, the di\u00aeerent solutions correspond to di\u00aeerent points at which the curves cross the Y-axis, each such point representing a speci\u00afc value of y(0) - the initial condition. You should get the idea that for any di\u00aeerential equation that we study , the plane is \u00aflled with graphs of functions that solve the di\u00aeerential equation and that no two of the graphs intersect. In order to construct the previous graphs, we needed to know the solutions. However, we can `almost' construct the previous graphs with out knowing any solutions. The di\u00aeerential equation y0(t) =f(t; y) speci\u00afes the slope, f (t;y),of the solution passing through, the point ( t;y) in the plane. Knowing the point and the slope, we can construct a (short) tangent to the graph of the solution, without having a formula for the solution.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 720 A 2 0 2 4 6 8 1020246810 Time, ty(t) B 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 23210123 Time, ty(t) Figure 16.2: A.

Slopes at many points appear in Figure 16.4B. Explore 16.3.1 Find the three direction \u00afeld tangents in Figure 16.4B that correspond to the three tangents shown in Figure 16.4A. If for a single di\u00aeerential equation we draw enough of the short tangent lines, we obtain a picture that strongly suggests the shapes of the solution curves. The short tangents show the `directions' of the solutions. Graphs of the short tangent lines are called direction \u00afelds . A direction \u00afeld for y0=t\u00a12ty is shown in Figure 16.5. Starting from the point Aand following the direction tangents, it is fairly obvious that the curve shown approximates the graph of a solution.

A di\u00aeerential equation of the form y0=f(y) (RHS is independent of t)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 725 is called an autonomous di\u00aeerential equation. y0=y2is autonomous y0=t+y2is not autonomous A di\u00aeerential equation that models an isolated population in a constant environment is typically autonomous. If there is occasional migration into or out of the population or the environment \u00b0uctuates with time, the model di\u00aeerential equation will not be autonomous. A di\u00aeerential equation that models penicillin clearance following a single injection or even constant infusion is autonomous; if there are subsequent injections or variation in the infusion, the model di\u00aeerential equation is not autonomous. De\u00afnition 16.4.1 For an autonomous di\u00aeerential equation y0=f(y); ifyis such that f(y) = 0, then y(t) =yis a solution to y0=f(y),yis called an equilibrium point fory0=f(y), and y(t) =yis called an equilibrium solution . For example, the equation y0=f(y) = (y\u00a12)\u00a3(y\u00a13) is autonomous and f(2) = 0 and f(3) = 0. Therefore y= 2 and y= 3 are equilibrium points. Also y(t) = 2 is an equilibrium solution 0 It Checks. The of Verhulst's logistic di\u00aeerential equation p0(t) =r\u00a3p(t)\u00a3\u00c3 1\u00a1p(t) M!

The direction \u00afeld for the logistic di\u00aeerential equation is shown in Figure 16.8A. The graph of p0vs p, or the graph of fwhere f(p) =r\u00a3p\u00a3\u00b5 1\u00a1p M\u00b6Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 726 A 00M AB Time, tPopulation, p(t) B 0 M0 pp (0,0) 16.8: A.

The arrows point to the right where f(p)>0 and point to the left where f(p)<0. is shown in Figure 16.8B. This graph is called a phase plane graph. Phase plane graphs are easier to draw than are direction \u00afelds, but give similar information. In this case the phase plane graph is a parabola. The arrows point to the right where f(p)>0 and point to the left where f(p)<0. From the direction \u00afeld, we can immediately see two horizontal lines that are graphs of two solutions, p= 0 and p=M both of which are equilibrium solutions. In the phase plane we can see the same equilibrium points. Simply observe that f(0) = 0 and f(M) = 0 The meaning of the equilibrium solution, p= 0, is fairly obvious; if there are no rabbits at time t= 0 there will be no rabbits at any subsequent time (the model does not account for migration into the population, nor spontaneous generation of rabbits). The equilibrium solution, p=M, is not quite so obvious, but makes sense. If the population size equals the the carrying capacity, the environment will support that size population and no more, and the population size will persist at that value. Now examine the direction \u00afeld in Figure 16.8A for the solution that passes through the point, (0; A), for which 0< p(0) = A < M Initial population less than carrying capacity. The graph will rise from (0 ; A) and will be asymptotic to the line y=M; the population increases to the maximum the environment will support. The point Athat marks ( A; f(A)) is shown on the phase plane. We can see from that point that f(A)>0, implying that p0is positive so that the population is increasing. Thus from ( A; f(A)) we have drawn a horizontal arrow pointing to the right, or pointing toward increasing values of p. We do not see the shape of the solution from the phase plane, but we can see the qualitative character that the solution is increasing when the population size is A. Next examine the direction \u00afeld and the solution that passes through the point, (0 ; B), for which M < B =p(0) Initial population exceeds the carrying capacity.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 727 The graph will decrease from (0 ; B) and also will be asymptotic5to the line y=M. The point, ( B; f(B)), is shown on the phase plane. We can see from that point that f(B)<0, implying that p0is negative so that the population is decreasing. Thus from ( B; f(B)) we have drawn a horizontal arrow pointing to the left, or pointing toward decreasing values of p. Stability of solutions. Two important properties of the solutions p= 0 and p=Mof p0(t) =r\u00a3p(t)\u00a3\u00b3 1\u00a1p(t) M\u00b4 are apparent from the direction \u00afeld in Figure 16.8. For a solution that is near the line p=M, as time progresses the short tangent segments guide that solution toward that line. Every solution near p=Mis asymptotic to p=Mwith increasing time, and the solution p=Mis said to be asymptotically stable . If, for example, the population is at the carrying capacity and random environmental e\u00aeects cause the population to either increase or decrease from carrying capacity, the population size will move back toward the carrying capacity as time increases. On the other hand, the arrows near the equilibrium solution p= 0 will be guided away from p= 0 as time progresses. There are solutions near the line p= 0 that move away from the line as time increases, andp= 0 is said to be a nonstable solution. If you introduce a single rabbit (perhaps two!) into an environment with out rabbits (Australia, for example), then the rabbit population will soon expand to carrying capacity (the asymptotically stable solution). Stability of constant solutions can also be determined from the phase plane. At points near the equilibrium points in Figure 16.8 a horizontal arrow is drawn pointing to the right at ( p; f(p)) iff(p)>0 and pointing to the left if f(p)<0. The lengths of the arrows re\u00b0ect the magnitude of f(p). Near ( M;0) the arrows all point toward Mindicating the Mis asymptotically stable, and near (0,0) the arrows all point away from 0 indicating that 0 is not stable. Example 16.4.1 An extreme example. Shown in Figure 16.9 are the direction \u00afeld and the phase plane graph of y0= (y\u00a11)\u00a3(y\u00a12)\u00a3(y\u00a13)\u00a3(y\u00a14) A 0 1 2 3 401234 Time, ty(t) B 1 2 the y0= (y\u00a11)\u00a3(y\u00a12)\u00a3(y\u00a13)\u00a3(y\u00a14).

It is probably more realistic to suppose that if the current population exceeds the maximum supportable population by very much, there will be a rather catastrophic immediate decrease to a level less than M(hopefully still positive), followed by a gradual increase to M.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 728 equilibrium points. Solutions, y(t), with y(0) close to 1 will be asymptotic to y= 1 and solutions with y(0) close to 3 will be asymptotic to y= 3. Also, solutions starting close to 2 will not be asymptotic to y= 2 and solutions starting close to 4 will not be asymptotic to y= 4. Explore 16.4.1 What qualitative character of the graph of f(y) = (y\u00a11)\u00a3(y\u00a12)\u00a3(y\u00a13)\u00a3(y\u00a14) distinguishes the stable equilibrium points 1 and 3 from the equilibrium points 2 and 4? Hint: Examine f0. De\u00afnition 16.4.2 Asymptotically stable an equilibrium point yof y0=f(y) is an asymptotically stable equilibrium point means that there is an interval (a; b) containing y, and every solution, y(t), toy0=f(y) for which a < y (0)< b is asymptotic to the horizontal line y=y. We hope you guessed the following theorem from the Extreme Example 16.4.1. Theorem 16.4.1 Iff(y) and are continuous, y0=f(y) is asymptotically stable if f0(y) is negative. Proof: This proof is technical and should be omitted on \u00afrst reading. Suppose the hypothesis of the theorem and let \u00a1m=f0(y)<0 and for convenience suppose y= 0 . There is a >0 such that if \u00a1a\u00b7y\u00b7a, then \u00a12m\u00b7f0(y)\u00b7 \u00a1m=2. Suppose 0 < y0< aandy(t) is the solution to y(0) = y0,y0(t) =f(y). The argument for \u00a1a < y 0<0 is similar. We will show that e\u00a12mt\u00b7y(t)\u00b7e\u00a1(m=2)t. Suppose t0>0 and 0 \u00b7y(t)\u00b7afor y0(t) =f(y(t)) =f(y(t))\u00a1f(0) = f0(ct)\u00a3y(t)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 729 where 0 \u00b7ct\u00b7y(t)\u00b7a. Then for y0e\u00a12mt0\u00b7y(t)\u00b7y0e\u00a1(m=2)t0. Suppose for some t1either y(t1)\u00b70 ora\u00b7y(t1). Then there is a least such number and let t0denote that least number. Then, 0 < y0e\u00a12mt0\u00b7y(t0)\u00b7y0e\u00a1(m=2)t0< a, which is a contradiction. There is no such number t1. End of Proof. In case f0(y)>0 then yis not stable, and if f0(y) = 0, ymay be stable and it may not be stable. 16.4.1 Parameter Reduction. Example 16.4.2 Parameter Reduction. It is customary the M to obtain u0(t) =r\u00a3u(t)\u00a3(1\u00a1u(t)) Fraction Logistic (16.9) uis the fraction of the carrying capacity, M, used by the population.

First we divide the time axis [0, 10] into intervals of length 2 and let t0= 0 t1= 2 t2= 4 t3= 6 t4= 8 and t5= 10 Our objective is to compute v0,v1,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2, and v5so t5; v5) close to the graph of the solution, v(t). Step 0. letv0= 0:2. Then ( t0; v0) is a point of the graph of the solution. Step 1. From the di\u00aeerential equation, the slope of the solution at (0, 0.2) is v0(0) = v(0)\u00a3e\u00a1v(0)\u00a10:1\u00a3v(0) = 0:2e\u00a10:2\u00a10:1\u00a40:2 = 0:1437 We construct the interval between t0= 0 and t1= 2 that starts at (0, 0.2) and has slope 0.1437. See Figure 16.10A. The right end point is at t1= 2 and the ordinate is v1= 0:2 + 2\u00a30:1437 0 0 :1437 = v0\u00a3e\u00a1v0\u00a10:1\u00a4v0so that v1=v0+ 2\u00a3(v0\u00a3e\u00a1v0\u00a10:1\u00a3v0) Step 2. The slope of the direction \u00afeld ( t1; v1) = (2 ;0:4874) is v1\u00a3e\u00a1v1\u00a10:1\u00a3v1= = 0 :2506 We construct the interval between t1= 2 and t2= 4 that starts at (2, 0.4874) and has slope 0.2507.

We compute the slope of the direction \u00afeld at (4,0.9888) and construct the interval with that slope between t2= 4 and t3= 6 that starts at (4, 0.9888).

Example 16.5.2 We \u00afnd an approximate solution to y(0) = 2 y0(t) =t\u00a1y for 0\u00b7t\u00b74; the graph of the solution is shown in Figure 16.12A. Both tandyappear in the RHS in this problem.

Our approximation is shown in Figure 16.12A and is not close enough to the solution to satisfy us. The approximation computed using time-interval size h= 0:25 is shown in Figure 16.12B and it is more acceptable. The initial and \u00afnal computations for h= 0:25 are shown in Table 16.2 Because the RHS of y0(t) =t\u00a1yinvolves both tandy, these numbers are not computed on a calculator using only ANS, the previous answer key. A calculator program that will do the computations is included in Table 16.3. Euler's Method. The scheme we have been using is called Euler's Method after Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) who introduced the y(a) =ya y0(t) 16.2: Euler computations for y(0) 2, y0(t) =t\u00a1y(t) on program, trapezoid to Ackerman, August 12, 2010 740 1.Choose na number of intervals and let h=b\u00a1a n. 2.Lettk=a+k\u00a4h, fork= 0, 1, 2, \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2,nand \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2,n\u00a11 let yk+1=yk+h\u00a4f(tk; yk). Euler's Method replaces a di\u00aeerential equation with a discrete di\u00aeerence equation. For example, for 1\u00a1yk M\u00b6 This is the discrete logistic equation that we studied in Section 11.2 on page 478. Satellites in orbit and space ships traveling in the solar system are subject to complex gravitational \u00afelds from the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, and other planets and their di\u00aeerential equations of motion are always solved numerically. Weather predictions are based on di\u00aeerential equations (called partial di\u00aeerential equations because their solution functions depend on three space variables and time). These equations are complex and involve a vast grid of space and time data points and can only be solved numerically. 16.5.1 The trapezoid and Runge-Kutta methods. Euler's method is intuitive and instructional, but not very accurate. If you are traveling in a space ship to the Moon, you hope the folks at NASA Houston are using something better than Euler's Method to control your space ship, and there are numerous accurate methods for approximating solutions of di\u00aeerential equations. We present two additional methods that show one form of improvement. Euler's Method estimates the slope of a solution at the left end point, tkof the interval [ tk; tk+1] and assumes that slope is unchanged throughout the interval. This is similar to using rectangles to approximate an integral. For approximating an integral, we got better results using the trapezoid method which uses the average of the values of the integrand at the two end points of each interval in the partition. The trapezoid method for approximating a solution to a di\u00aeerential equation uses a similar procedure. Thetrapezoidal method to approximate the solution to the di\u00aeerential equation y(a) =ya y0(t) =f(t; y) is summarized by na number of intervals and let h=b\u00a1a n. 2.Lettk=a+k\u00a4hfork= 0, 1, 2, \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2,n, and let 0, 1, 2, \u00a2\u00a2\u00a2,n\u00a11, let + sl2) / 2 Time, ty(t) of the trapezoid procedure is shown in Figure 16.13. slope 1= sl 1is the usual Euler's Method slope. slope 2= sl 2is the direction \u00afeld slope at the point f(tk+h; yk+h\u00a3sl1); the point projected by Euler's method. Then the slope from yktoyk+1is the average of sl 1and sl 2. Example 16.5.3 We use the trapezoid method to approximate the solution to y(0) = 2 y0(t) =t\u00a1y 0\u00b7t\u00b74 using n= 16 intervals and compare the results with those obtained with Euler's method.

A table that compares the results of Euler's method and the trapezoid method is shown in Table 16.4.. It has to be acknowledged that the trapezoid method requires about twice as much arithmetic as that of Euler's method7. Therefore, we compare the accuracy of Euler's method using 32 intervals with the trapezoid method using 16 intervals. It can be seen that with comparable arithmetic e\u00aeort the trapezoid scheme gives closer approximations. The increased accuracy in this case may not seem impressive, but if you are trying to dock the space shuttle onto the space station, the improved accuracy may be appreciated. The Runge-Kutta method. A popular and accurate extension of the trapezoid algorithm called the Runge-Kutta method is included for algorithm to solve y(a) h= (b\u00a1a)=nandtk=a+k\u00a3h,k= 1; n. 7The usual way of evaluating the required work is to count the number of times f(t; y) has to be evaluated; once for each Euler step and twice for each trapezoid step.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 743 Table 16.4: Comparison of Euler's method with 32 intervals and trapezoid approximation using 16 intervals to the solutions of y(0) = 2, y0(t) =t\u00a1y(t). Step, requires four functional evaluations per step, so to compare it with the Euler method and trapezoid method illustrated in Table 16.4 only 8 steps with h= 0:5 are used. The Runge-Kutta method has even greater accuracy than that of the trapezoid method with no more computational e\u00aeort.

At this time you should see that close approximations to the solution of many di\u00aeerential with simple arithmetic, perhaps a lot of it. It is even better than that, for we can use the same ideas to solve two di\u00aeerential equations involving two unknown functions, uandv, b0(t) = = 0 Euler's method applied to these equations (using step size 5 minutes) simply returns us to the di\u00aeerence equations we \u00afrst used to study penicillin clearance. We might also use a trapezoidal rule that would improve our accuracy. We have not shown that as the interval size, h, gets close to zero Euler's approximations get close to the actual solution to the equation. For `well behaved' di\u00aeerential equations, they do, as do the trapezoidal approximations. The analysis, however, is beyond our goal. We will soon show a few of the numerous important analytic techniques for \u00afnding exact solutions to di\u00aeerential equations. Analytic formulas for solutions provide a lot more insight and intuition about the solutions than do tables of numbers, even graphs of tables of numbers. And a formula can be more easily carried to the next stage of a problem than can a table of numbers. Ambiguity. We have ignored a serious problem that can arise. The di\u00aeerential equation with initial condition y(0) = 0 y0(t) y(t) (16.16) y1(t) =t2andy2(t) 0, y1(t) 0 02= 0 Check y2(0) = 0 Check. y10(t) = 2 y0 0 Solves Euler's method to approximate solution to y(0) = 0 y0(t) = 2q y(t)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 746 yields y0= 0; y 1=y0+ 2py0= 0 + 2p ; y 2= 0;\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2 yn= 0 Euler's method gives no hint that y(t) =t2solves the equation. Almost surely, if your di\u00aeerential equation evolves from a real biological model, it will have unique solutions. Conversely, if your equation has multiple solutions, the model is probably not well formulated. It will be seen, however, that the model we derive for mold growth in Section 16.9.5 on page 776 comes perilously close to the example just presented. Uniqueness. Mathematicians have derived conditions that will insure the uniqueness of solutions to y(a) =ya y) denotes the partial derivative of f(t; y) with respect to the second variable (the \u00afrst variable is held constant). Theorem 16.6.1 Existence a\u00a1d\u00b7t\u00b7a+d y a\u00a1d\u00b7y\u00b7ya+d d > 0; then on an interval a\u00a1e\u00b7t\u00b7a+e,0< e < d there is a unique solution to y(a) =ya y0(t) =f(t; y) a\u00b7t\u00b7b Under the hypothesis that f2is continuous on the rectangle, it follows that f2is bounded on the rectangle, and the proof of Theorem 16.6.1 hinges on this fact. In our example Equation 16.16 y(0) = 0 y0(t) = 2py and f2(t; y) =1py At the initial data point, y(0) = 0, f2(0;0) is not even de\u00afned and f2(t; y) =1pyis certainly not bounded in any rectangle containing the initial data point, (0 ;0). Equation 16.16 does not satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem 16.6.1. Another type of exception may occur. The di\u00aeerential equation y(0) = 0 y0(t) = 1 + y20\u00b7t\u00b72 has a unique solution y(t) = tan t Note: y0(t) = sec2t sec2t= 1 + tan2t The problem is that the solution y(t) = tan tonly extends on the interval 0 \u00b7t <\u00bc 2:= 1:57. The original problem asked for a solution on the interval [0, 2]. For y0(t) = 1 + y2f(t; y) = 1 + y2and fy(t; y) = 2 yCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 747 and both fandf2are continuous for all ( t; y). The hypothesis of Theorem 16.6.1 is satis\u00afed, but the theorem only guarantees a solution on some interval a\u00a1e\u00b7t\u00b7a+eand not throughout [ a; b]. Despite the two previous examples, you should expect di\u00aeerential equations that you derive from a biological model to have a unique solutions valid over the reasonable life of your system. You should expect to be able to compute a good approximation to the solution, perhaps using a more sophisticated system than either Euler's method or the trapezoid method.

In this case there are multiple solutions that peel o\u00ae of the equilbrium solution, u= 0:1 ast increases; in a sense, it is super unstable. You should have found that the hypothesis of Theorem 16.6.1 is not satis\u00afed near u= 0. Solutions with small positive initial values quickly join with u= 0; in a sense, u= 0 is super stable.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 748 16.7 First order linear di\u00aeerential equations.

That y(t) in Equation 16.18 solves and is the only solution to the initial condition and equation of 16.17 is explored in Exercises 16.7.3 - 16.7.5 16.7.1 Rationale for Steps 1 and 2. Steps 1 and 2 are presented as Twin Lightning Bolts Out Of The Blue to solve the equation y0(t) +p(t)\u00a3y(t) =q(t) There is rationale leading to Steps 1 and 2 and the rationale is used in equations involving second and higher order derivatives. First one should look at the special case of q(t) = 0 LHS y0(t) +p(t)\u00a3y(t) = 0 (16.19) This is called a homogeneous linear equation and typically occurs when the system under study is isolated from external forces. qoften represents environmental input. y= 0 is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Because solutions are unique (Exercise 16.7.3), no other solution intersects the solution y= 0. Therefore every other solution is either always positive or always negative. For this discussion, we assume we are looking for a solution yh(subscript hfor `homogeneous') that is always positive. A procedure to solve Equation 16.19 is called separation of variables , meaning to write the equation in a form that has the terms involving yon one side and the terms involving ton the other side. We write (because yh>0) y0 h(t) +p(t)\u00a3yh(t) = erf(x) =2 \u00bcRx 0e\u00a1t2dt.Cornette = \u00a1p(t)\u00a3yh(t) y0 h(t) yh(t)=\u00a1p(t) Now the derivative formulas, and \u00afnd [lny(t)]0=y0(t) y(t): Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, equation. ymight be some variation of yh. Included with several trials, one asks whether Cinyh=Ce\u00a1u(t)might be a variable, v(t). That is, might a solution to the nonhomogeneous equation be of a form y(t) =v(t)\u00a3yh(t) ? (16.20) You should guess that the answer is 'yes' is or we would not be writing about it. Our goal is to \u00afnd a function, v, so that y(t) =v(t)\u00a3e\u00a1u(t)solves y0(t) +p(t)\u00a3y(t) De\u00afne v(t) =Rt aeu(s)p(s)ds. The constant, C, inyh=Ce\u00a1u(t)is sometimes called a parameter, and replacing Cby the variable v(t) is called variation of parameter(s) . Variation of parameters has wide use, but we will not employ it again. However, the method of separation of variables is used to \u00afnd an analytic solution to the logistic equation and other autonomous equations in Section 16.8. Example 16.7.3 Two integral formula examples. Steps 1 and 2 of Theorem 16.7.1 are easy to understand but require some integral formulas to compute the integrals. We will use the following two formulas to solve problems: Rteatdt=1 ateat\u00a11 = 2 ; y0(t) + 2y(t) = sin 3 t. a= 0; y 0= 2; p(t) = order linear di\u00aeerential equations. Exercise 16.7.1 Use Steps 1 and 2 in Theorem 16.7.1 and the integral formulas shown there to compute the solutions, y(t), to the following di\u00aeerential equations. After parts a. - d. the explicit dependence of yontis suppressed in the di\u00aeerential equations. You will need Equations 16.21. a: y (0) = 2 y0(t) + 0:2y(t) = 0 :1 b : y(1) = 1 y0(t) +1 ty(t) = 0 :1 c: y (0) = 3 y0(t) + 3y(t) = t d: y(0) = 0 y0(t) +y(t) = sin t e: y (1) = 1 y0+1 ty= 1 f : y (0) = 3 y0+y=et 2 y0+ (sin t)y= sin t j: y (0) = 5 y0+ 3y= sin 4 t Exercise 16.7.2 Find the unique solutions to a: y(0) = 5 y0+ 2y= 0 b : y(0) = 0 y0+ 2y= c: y (0) y(1) = y0+ 3y=t e: y = 0 y0+ 0:2y=e\u00a10:2tf: y (0) = 3 y0+ty=t Exercise 16.7.3 The hypothesis of Theorem 16.6.1 may be modi\u00afed to assume that f(t; y) and f2(t; y) are continuous on a rectangle, a\u00b7t\u00b7a+dandya\u00a1d\u00b7y\u00b7ya+d((a; ya) is on the left edge of the rectangle instead of in the middle) and then conclude that there is a solution to y(a) =ya,y0=f(t; y) on an interval [ a; a+\u00b2]. Suppose p(t) and q(t) are continuous on an y) are continuous on a\u00b7t\u00b7a+d,ya\u00a1d\u00b7ya+dso that existence and uniqueness of a solution to Equation 16.17 on some interval [ a; a+\u00b2] is assured.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 753 Exercise 16.7.4 Suppose p(t) and q(t) of Equation 16.17 are de\u00afned and continuous on an interval [a; b]. Show that there is a solution y(t) in Equation 16.18 de\u00afned on all of [ u(a) and v(a) SCUBA diver whose depth tminutes after the start of the dive is d(t) meters, and the water pressure will be 1 + d(t)=10 atmospheres. Air is 79 percent nitrogen. Haldane's equation for nitrogen partial pressure, N(t), in a given tissue is (from Equation 16.12 This order linear di\u00aeerential equation. See Exercise 5.5.24 and Haldane's Mathematical Model 5.5.9. Your goal is to solve Equation 16.22 a.Rewrite Equation 16.22 to put it into the is `conventional wisdom' among SCUBA divers that if you are going to make a dive that involves two depths, `do the deep part \u00afrst'. This problem and the next explores rationale for that wisdom. To be concrete, assume that K= 0:07 which corresponds to approximately 10 minute half-life for the compartment ((ln 2) =0:07 = 9 :9).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 754 a.Assume a diver descends immediately to 10 meters and stays there for 15 minutes, then descends to 30 meters and stays there for 10 minutes. Let d1(t) =( 10 for 0 \u00b7t\u00b715 30 for 15 < t\u00b725 Compute N1(25) = 0 :79 + 0 = 2 :24 Atmospheres. b.Assume a diver descends immediately to 30 meters and stays there for 10 minutes, then ascends to 10 meters and stays there for 15 minutes. Let d2(t) =( 30 for 0 \u00b7t\u00b710 10 for 10 < t\u00b725 Compute N2(25) = 1 :72 Atmospheres. Thus by doing the deep part of the dive \u00afrst, the end state of N 2partial pressure in this compartment is at least 20% less than if she had made the shallow part of the dive \u00afrst. Exercise 16.7.8 It is instructive to see the graphs of N1(t) and N2(t) of the previous problem. You can plot these graphs on your calculator. We plotted N2on the TI-86 by exp( \u00a10:07x)\u00a4y2 Also see Exercise Figure 16.7.8 Use the graphs to explain how nitrogen absorption di\u00aeers with the two dive pro\u00afles. Figure for Exercise 16.7.8 Nitrogen pro\u00afles in a 10-minute half-life compartment of a diver with two dive plans. One is to dive to 10 meters for 15 minutes, then to 30 meters for 10 minutes. The other pro\u00afle is for a dive to 30 meters for 10 minutes followed by 10 meters for 15 minutes.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 755 0 5 10 15 20 2500.511.52 Time minutesN2 partial pressure in 10min halflife tissueN1N2 Exercise 16.7.9 A diver is to survey the life on the bottom of a near-shore marine environment. She is to follow a transect that declines 30\u00b1and will travel 40 meters at 1 meter per minute along the 30\u00b1slope. You will need the formula: Z teatdt=1 ateat=1 a2eat+C: a.She starts at the shore and travels 40 meters along the 30\u00b1slope. At one meter per minute she will be at depth d(t) =1 2t t minutes into the dive. and the water pressure in atmospheres will be d(t)=10. What will be the partial pressure of N 2in tissue with K= 0:07 at the end of her dive? b.She swims out to a point above the end point of the previous dive, descends and travels back toward shore. At one meter per minute she will be at depth d(t) = 20 \u00a11 2t t minutes into the dive. What will be the partial pressure of N 2in tissue with K= 0:07 at the end of her dive? Exercise 16.7.10 J. S. Haldane did the initial work on decompression illness in divers and used the model of the previous exercises. He assumed the body would have tissues with half-lives of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 75 minutes and set a criteria that the partial pressure of nitrogen in a diver's tissue should not be more than 2 times the partial pressure of nitrogen in her blood. (Actually, he began this work in 1905 and it was hisblood, not herblood.) Compute curves analogous to those in Exercise Figure 16.7.8 for a compartment of 5 minute half-life ( K= (ln 2) =5 = 0 of 75 (K= (ln 2) =45 = 0 :0154) minute half-life. 16.8 Separation of variables. Separation of Variables. If in the di\u00aeerential equation, y0=f(t; y), the RHS factors into f(t; y) written y0(t) =g(t)\u00a3h(y)1 h(y)y0(t) =g(t) (16.24)Cornette variables tandyare separable . The solution to H(y(t)) =G(t) +C where Cis a constant (16.25) is an implicit expression of y(t). If a data point, y(a) =yais given, then Ccan be computed from see that function, Equation 16.25 solves Equation 16.24 we di\u00aeerentiate = Step 2. such that G0(t) = 2 t. Choose G(t) =t2 By the Parallel Graph Theorem there is a number, C1, such that lny(t) =t2+C1 This implicit expression for ycan be solved explicitly. y(t) =et2+C1=et2\u00a3eC1=Cet2(16.26) If we are also given that, for example, y(0) = 3 then we write y(0) = 3 = Ce02=C y (t) = 3 et2Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 757 Explore 16.8.1 Alternatively, we might be given that y(0) =\u00a13. Return to Equation 16.26 and solve for the solution. Example 16.8.2 Of the following six equations, the variables can be separated in only two. shown separated in every autonomous di\u00aeerential equation y0=f(y)1 f(y)y0= 1 To \u00afnd an implicit solution to any autonomous di\u00aeerential equation only the problem SV Step 1 Find F(y) such that F0(y) =1 f(y)requires attention. SV Step 2 G0(t) = 1 Answer: G(t) =t Example 16.8.4 To solve and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 758 If also an initial condition is given, for example y(0) = 0 :5, 2: 16.8.1 The logistic equation. By far the most important di\u00aeerential equation that we solve by separation of variables is the logistic equation p0=r\u00a3p\u00a3\u00b5 1\u00a1p M\u00b6 We treat the Case: 0 < p(0) = p0< M. From the direction \u00afeld for the logistic equation in Figure 16.8 we have seen that 0 < p(0)< M implies that for all time, t, 0< p(t)< M. First we separate variables 1 p\u00a3(1\u00a1p=M)\u00a3p0=r Then we use an algebraic identity (see the following section, Partial Fractions) 1 p\u00a3(1\u00a1p=M)=1 p+1 M\u00a1p(16.27) to provide a solution to < that both ln pand ln( M\u00a1p) M\u00a1p=ert+C1=ert\u00a3eC1 p M\u00a1p=CertCornette Ackerman, 12, 2010 759 The = p0, 1 p\u00a3(1\u00a1p=M)=1 p+1 M\u00a1p by adding the two fractions on the right and showing that the sum can be written as the fraction on the left. 16.8.2 The Method of Partial Fractions. The ratioP(x) Q(x)where P(x) and Q(x) are polynomials and the degree of P(x)is less than the degree of Q(x) can be partitioned into the sum of fractions with simple denominators. The pattern is illustrated by the four d. The method is used to replace a complex integral such as Zpx2+qx+r (x\u00a1a)\u00a3(x\u00a1b)\u00a3(x\u00a1c)dx by (Example c.) the sum of three relatively easy integrals ZA x\u00a1adx+ZB x\u00a1bdx+ZC x\u00a1cdxCornette and Ackerman, August 12, 4 (x+ 3)\u00a3(x\u00a12)=A x+ 3x+ = A\u00a3(x\u00a12) +B\u00a3(x+ 3) Then substitute x=\u00a13 3( \u00a13) + +B\u00a3(\u00a13 = 3(2) + + 3) 10 = B= 2 Thus3x+ 4 (x+ 3)\u00a3(x\u00a12)=1 x+ 3+2 x\u00a12 The method is used to compute (x+ 3)\u00a3(x\u00a12)dx=Z1 x+ 3dx+Z2 of x(we used x=\u00a13 and x= 2 above) any two values of xare acceptable. The chosen values, -3 and 2, each annihilate one of the terms and leave only one term with one of the unknown parameters AandB. It is curious that the most convenient values of x, -3 and 2, are exactly the values of xfor which the original fraction 3x+ 4 (x+ 3)\u00a3(x\u00a12) is meaningless. Example 16.8.6 1 = A\u00a3(x\u00a12)2+B\u00a3(x\u00a12)\u00a3(x+ 1) + C\u00a3(x+ 1)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 761 Then substitute x=\u00a11 3( \u00a11)2\u00a14(\u00a11) + 1 = A\u00a3(\u00a11\u00a12)2+B\u00a3(\u00a11\u00a12)(\u00a11 + 1) + C\u00a3(\u00a11 + 1) 9 = A\u00a3(9) A= 1 x= 2 3(2)2\u00a15\u00a32 + 1 = A\u00a3(2\u00a12)2+B\u00a3(2\u00a12)(2 + 1) + C\u00a3(2 + 1) 3 = C\u00a3(3) C= 1 x= 0 3(0)2\u00a15\u00a30 + 1 = A\u00a3(0\u00a12)2+B\u00a3(0\u00a12)(0 + 1) + C\u00a3(0 + 1) 1 = 4 A\u00a12B+C 1 = 4 \u00a31\u00a12B+ 1 B= 2 Thus3x2\u00a15x+ 1 (x+ 1)\u00a3(x\u00a12)2=1 x+ 1+2 x\u00a12+1 (x\u00a12)2 The method is used to (x+ 2 lnjx\u00a12j \u00a12(x\u00a12)\u00a11+C In this case, there were only two values of xthat annihilated other terms, -1 and 2, and a third value ofxwas required because there were three unknown parameters, A,B, and C. We chose x= 0 as a convenient third value to use. Example 16.8.7 In Problem 16.4.11 on page 733 three di\u00aeerential equations were suggested as possible population models illustrating the Allee e\u00aeect, in which there is a threshold population density, \u00b2, with the property that if the density were less than \u00b2the population would be so thinly distributed that reproductive success would not counter natural loss and the population will become extinct. Two of these equations can be solved by the method of separation of variables using partial fraction expansion.

An example of Equation 16.30 is shown in Figure 16.15. For the purpose of the graph, we have let \u00b2= 0:1.

Generally, \u00afrst order di\u00aeerential equations apply to problems of the type The rate of change of [a quantity, y(t)] is proportional to [a quantity described in terms of y(t) and possibly also t]. For example, Mathematical Model 16.9.1 The rate of change of oxygen in the air sac of an egg is proportional to the di\u00aeerence between the external oxygen concentration and the oxygen concentration inside the sac. Let \u00ad( t) be the amount of oxygen (measured as mg of O 2) in the air sac at time t, and let Vbe the volume of the sac, and [ O2] be the ambient partial pressure of oxygen.

It is an observed fact and may have been your experience that light intensity decreases as one descends from the surface of a lake or ocean. This problem addresses the question as to what is the light intensity, I(x), at a distance, xmeters, below the surface of a lake or ocean, assuming that the light intensity striking the surface is a known quantity, I0. 9Alexis L.

We will use an hypothesis about light transmission in water (see Figure 16.16). Hypothesis L: The amount of light absorbed by a (horizontal) layer of water is proportional to the thickness of the layer and to the amount of light entering the layer. Hypothesis L implies Implication 1. That the light absorbed by a 10 cm layer of water is twice the light absorbed by a 5cm layer of water and Implication 2. A layer that absorbs 10% of a dim light will absorb 10% of a bright light. Implication (1) is approximately true for thin layers and for low levels of turbidity. Implication (2) is fairly robust. The double proportionality of Hypothesis L is handled by assuming that the amount of light absorbed is proportional to the product of the thickness of the layer and the intensity of the light incident to the layer. That is, there is a number, K, such that if I(x) is the light intensity at depth xand I(x+ \u00a2) is the light intensity at depth x+ \u00a2, then I(x+ \u00a2)\u00a1I(x):=\u00a1K\u00a3\u00a2\u00a3I(x) (16.33) The product, K\u00a3\u00a2\u00a3I(x), has the advantage that for \u00afxed incident light intensity, I(x), the light absorbed, I(x+ \u00a2)\u00a1I(x), is proportional to the thickness, \u00a2, and for \u00afxed thickness \u00a2, the light absorbed is proportional to the incident light, I(x). Equation 5.23 can as the layer thickness, \u00a2, gets close to zero. Therefore lim \u00a2!0I(x+ \u00a2)\u00a1I(x) \u00a2=\u00a1KI(x) I0(x) = \u00a1KI(x) (16.34)Cornette and Ackerman, 2010 768 Exercise 16.9.3 Assume that 1000 w/m2of light is striking the surface of a lake and that 40% of that light is re\u00b0ected back into the atmosphere. Solve the initial value problem I0(x) = \u00a1KI(x) I(0) = 600 Suppose the light intensity at 10 meters is 500 w/m2. Find the value of K. 16.9.2 Spectrophotometer scales. Equation 5.24 has an important application in interpretation of readings of light absorbance as measured in spectrophotometers. The spectrophotometer has two scales; the top scale is marked fraction (or percent) transmission, the bottom scale is marked `absorbance.' InI0(x) =\u00a1KI(x), the constant, K, re\u00b0ects the turbidity of the water. With high turbidity, light intensity decreases rapidly with depth, so that Kis large. For clear water, light intensity decreases slowly with depth, and Kis small. In the spectrophotometer, the thickness of the layer of liquid is constant, being determined by the glass tube holding the sample. The variable is the turbidity of the liquid in the tube and is assumed proportional to the density of bacteria, dye, or other substance you wish to quantify. The general solution to I0(x) =\u00a1KI(x) is I(x) =I(0)e\u00a1Kx I(0) is determined by the light source in the spectrophotometer. Assume that the thickness of the liquid in the tube is \u00bf. Then the constant quantities in I(x) =I(0)e\u00a1Kxarex=\u00bfandI(0). The quantity measured by a photocell in the spectrophotometer and displayed in the top scale is I(\u00bf). We write I(\u00bf) of the liquid sample is proportional to the logarithm of the fraction of light transmitted through the sample, and the bottom scale of the spectrophotometer is the negative of the logarithm of the top scale. 16.9.3 Carbon dating of ancient organic material. Plants obtain carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide; animals obtain carbon from plants. The fraction of14Ccarbon in the total carbon of living animals and plants is the same as that of the atmosphere. At present that fraction is approximately 1 part14Cper 1012total carbon atoms. Upon death, no new carbon is absorbed and the14Cdecays back to nitrogen 14 6C\u00a1!14 7N+\u00af\u00a1+\u00ba+energy (16.36)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 769 where \u00af\u00a1is an electron emitted from one of the neutrons of the14 6C, changing it to a proton, and \u00bais a neutrino that accompanies a \u00af\u00a1emission. Measure of the \u00af\u00a1emission is a measure of the14Ccontent of the carbon under study. One gram of carbon from presently living tissue contains about 5 \u00a31010 14C atoms and emits about 15 :3\u00af\u00a1particles per minute. In carbon from ancient plants and animals, some of the14Chas decayed and the rate of \u00af\u00a1emission is smaller. Mathematical Model of14Cdecay. The rate at which14Cdecreases is proportional to the amount of14Cpresent. The reaction is describe by d dt14C=\u00a1K\u00a314C (16.37) For carbon dating assume that time is measured with zero at the year 1950 and negative times before that. For example, t=\u00a13000 corresponds to 1050 BC (or BCE, before the common era). Let E(t) be the level of \u00af\u00a1emission per minute from one gram of carbon in living tissue at time t. Scientists initially assumed that E(t) is equal to the present value, E(0) = 15 :3, for all time, but as will be seen in Figure 16.17, E(t) is not constant. Let Et0(t) be\u00af\u00a1emission per minute from one gram of carbon at time tin the remains of an organism that died at a time t0\u00b7t. Note that Et0(0) = E(t0) and Et0(t0) is the\u00af\u00a1emission that we would measure today from a fossil of an animal that lived at time t0. The solution to Equation 16.37 may be written: 14C(t) =14C(t0)e\u00a1K(t\u00a1t0) Because \u00af\u00a1emission is directly proportional to14Ccontent, we write that Et0(t) =E(t0)e\u00a1K(t\u00a1t0): (16.38) Laboratory measurements have shown that in about 5730 years, one-half of the14Cin any sample will decay to nitrogen. Therefore, for any t0andt=t0+ 5730 be written Et0(t) =Et0(t0)e\u00a1ln 2 5730(t\u00a1t0)(16.39) Example 16.9.1 Problem Suppose the one gram of carbon from deer bone recently found among American Indian artifacts is emits 7 \u00af\u00a1particles per minute. How old is the bone?Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 770 Solution. Lett0be the time at which the deer died. Assume thatE(t0) =E(0) = 15 :3. Then Et0(t)jt=0=Et0(0) = 6464 years old. Exercise 16.9.4 Suppose the \u00af\u00a1emission per gram of carbon in a recently discovered bone is (1=2n)E(0) = (1 =2n) 15:3 where nis an integer. Assume thatE(t) =E(0) = 15 :3 for all t. How old is the bone? Note: Accurate measurement of (1 =2n) 15:3\u00af\u00a1emission is limited to n\u00b710. Date adjustment for varying ambient14Ccontent. We found the bone of Example 16.9.1 to be approximately 6464 years old, so that the humans occupied the camp in which which the bone was found approximately 6,464 years ago. We assumed that the\u00af\u00a1emission of carbon 6,646 years ago was the same as the present \u00af\u00a1emission. Techniques for measuring the14Cradiation and estimating the age of organic matter were developed by Willard F. Libby in the 1950's and have been checked by measuring the \u00af\u00a1emission of carbon from artifacts of known age; for two examples, carbon of heart wood of a giant sequoia tree shown by tree rings to be 2928\u00a750 years old, and by measuring the \u00af\u00a1emission of 4900 year old wood from a 1st dynasty Egyptian tomb. Careful analysis of these woods have shown that the ambient \u00af\u00a1emission of carbon has varied over the years, and age estimates must be modi\u00afed accordingly. A graph of ambient \u00af\u00a1emission levels for 9000 years is shown in Figure 16.1710. The vertical units in Figure 16.17 are measured as =\u00c3E(t)\u00a1E(0) E(0)! \u00a31000; E 1 graph, for 6,464 years ago, (4514 80, and IfE(t0) is 1 :08E(0) = 1 :08\u00a315:3 = 16 :52 and the \u00af\u00a1emission of the sample is 7, as assumed above, then the age ( \u00a1t0) of the bone would be found by 7 = 16 :52e\u00a1ln 2 5730\u00a4(\u00a1t0) t0=\u00a17098 10I was not able to locate a source to obtain copyright of this \u00afgure.

Produced by Leland McInnes using publicly available sources. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carbon-14-calibration.png Thus a substantial adjustment must be made in the age of the sample, from 6464 years old to 7098 years old. However, this may not be the \u00afnal answer, for you may see that 7098 years ago, the assumption that the ambient \u00b1(t) is 80 is not valid. One then can make another adjustment, and hope that the procedure converges to a single value. Exercise 16.9.5 Read the \u00b114Clevel for 7098 years ago (5148 BC) from Figure 16.17 and convert that toE(7098).

If the decay curve were that of14Cdecay, with a half life of 5730 years, a wood sample with a present day14Cradiation level could either be 4900 years old or 1600 years old. Fortunately, the decay curve illustrated has a half-life of 35,000 years and is not representative of 14Cdecay.

This leads to a contradiction. 16.9.4 Chemical Kinetics Chemical kinetics is the study of the rates of chemical reactions. The rate of a reaction is expressed in terms of the rate of disappearance of the reactants or the rate of appearance of the products. In the reaction A\u00a1!B (16.41) The reaction rate is Rate = \u00a1dA dt=dB dt(16.42) We consider only simple reactions in which the reaction rate is a function of the concentrations of the reactants11. A reaction of the formdA dt=\u00a1K\u00a3A (16.43) 11Refer to Linus Pauling, General Chemistry 1970, W. H. Freeman, New York, 1988, Dover, New York. Pauling, p552. \\The factors that determine the rate of reaction are manifold. The rate depends not only upon the composition of the reacting substances, but also upon their physical form, the intimacy of their mixture, the temperature and pressure, the concentrations of the reactants, special physical circumstances such as irradiation with visible light, ultraviolet light, x-rays, neutrons, or other waves or particles, and the presence of other substances that a\u00aeect the reaction but are not changed by it.\"Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 773 such as14Cdecay is called a \u00afrst order reaction. It also is a \u00afrst order di\u00aeerential equation, but not for the same reason. A reaction that occurs by the collision and combination of two molecules AandB, A+B\u00a1!AB has a reaction rate that is proportional to the concentrations of AandBand a rate equation \u00a1d[A] dt=k[A][B] (16.44) In the event that the concentrations of equal, Equation 16.44 becomes d[A] dt=\u00a1k[A][A]; (16.45) a \u00afrst order di\u00aeerential equation that describes a second order reaction. Equal quantities of gaseous hydrogen and iodine are mixed resulting in the reaction H2+I2\u00a1!2HI Because the initial amounts of H2andI2are equal and they combine equally, their concentrations will be equal. Let y(t) be [ H2] = [I2]. Then from equation 16.44, dy dt=\u00a1ky(t)\u00a3y(t) (16.46) ky0t+ 1where y0=y(0) reaction mA+nB\u00a1!AmBn has a rate equation d[A] dt=\u00a1k[A]m[B]n and some special cases are of interest. In the event that the initial concentration of Bgreatly exceeds that of A, then the concentration of Bwill be relatively constant during the reaction. With Abeing the rate limiting substance, the reaction will be an order mreaction. Let y(t) = [A] and assume [ B] is Then Equation 16.9.4 becomes dy(t) (t) =y0 y0^Kt+ 1:Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 774 Exercise 16.9.9 Show that for m= 3 the solution to dy(t) dt=\u00a1^K(y(t))mis y(t) =y0q 2y2 0^Kt+ 1 We now can see that for m= 1, 2, or 3 m= 1 = )lny(t) =^Kt+ lny0 m= 2^Kt+1 y2 09 >>>>>>>>= >>>>>>>>;(16.48) If data from a given then one of ln y(t),1 y(t), or1 (y(t))2may be linear in t, depending on whether each reaction step requires m= 1, 2, or 3 molecules of A. If neither is linear in t, then it would be assumed that the reaction step requires more than 3 molecules of A, or that the concentration of Bis changing enough to a\u00aeect the data. Example 16.9.2 Data from Reaction 1 of Exercise Table 16.9.10 are plotted in Figure 16.19 and it is clear that the data are from a second order reaction, and m= 2.

Now ^K[B]=0:4= 32 which is 8 times ^K[B]=0:2. Therefore, 2n= 8,n= 3, and the reaction is third order in B.

You may have attributed this to the fact that the growth is con\u00afned to the perimeter of the mold colony { the cells on the interior of the colony were not expanding. The pictures of the growth are shown on the page 28. A fairly accurate measure of the areas is shown in the Table 16.5. Each grid square in the photographs is 4 mm2. If you have not done so, you should enter the data in statistical lists for your calculator and \u00aft both an exponential function and a second degree polynomial to the data. You will \u00afnd that the polynomial \u00afts the data better, even though the exponential function shows a correlation of 0.97 with the data. LetA(t) be the area of the mold colony at time tandP(t) be the length of the perimeter. Because cell division appears to be taking place on the perimeter of the mold, a reasonable mathematical model is Mathematical Model 16.9.2 Mathematical Model. The rate of change of the area of the mold colony is proportional to the length of the perimeter. We will also assume that the mold colony is essentially circular, of radius R. Assumption.

Where are we going? The goal of this chapter is a theorem that gives conditions under which equi- libria of a system of two \u00afrst order di\u00aeerential equations will be stable. Only stable equilibria are observed in nature. Typical \u00afrst order systems are the competing species and the predator-prey equations: Competing Species Predator is similar to Theorem 12.9.1 that applies to systems of di\u00aeerence equations, and the stepping stones leading to the theorems are similar. 17.1 Constant coe\u00b1cient linear second order di\u00aeerential equations.

There may be resistance in the system which is a force against the direction of motion and it is customary and convenient to assume that the force of resistance = \u00a1r y0(t): The forces acting on the mass Division by min Equation 17.3 produces the form of the nonhomogeneous Equation 17.1 with p=r=m andq=k=m.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 780 17.1.1 The homogeneous equation. The homogeneous equation 17.2 is easily solved using methods similar to some used before. We 'guess' that there is a solution of the 0: Because ert6= 0, if there is a solution of the form y=ertto Equation 17.2 we should select rso that r2+pr+q= 0: (17.4) Furthermore the previous steps may be reversed. If ris a root to r2+pr+q= 0, then y=ertis a solution to y00(t) +p y0(t) +qy(t) = 0. Equation 17.4 is the characteristic equation and it roots are the characteristic roots of Equation 17.2. The characteristic roots are either distinct and real, a repeated real root, or complex conjugate roots. The following theorem is helpful in building solutions to Equation 17.2. Theorem 17.1.1 Superposition. Suppose y1(t) and y2(t) homogeneous equation y00(t) +py0(t) +qy(t) = 0 solution to y00(t) +qy(t) = 0 Proof. The proof of Theorem 17.1.1 is Exercise 17.1.1. The solutions to = 2 : (17.5) with y(0) = 1, y0(0) = 2 in each are shown in Figure 17.2. They illustrate the transition from distinct real roots ( p= 8) to a repeated real root ( p= 4) to complex roots ( p= 2) as the coe\u00b1cient of y0(t) (resistance to motion in Equation 17.3) decreases. By Theorem 17.1.1, if the characteristic roots of Equation 17.2 are distinct and real, r1andr2, then for any number C1and number C2 y(t) =C1er1t+C2er2t(17.6) 1You should suppose this to be a good guess or else we would not suggest it to you. It is motivated by the exponential solutions to the \u00afrst order di\u00aeerential equations of Chapter 16 and hope (and the fact that it has been known to work for some 250 years).Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 781 0 1 2 3 401 Time ty(t)p = 8 p = 4 p = 2 Figure 17.2: Graphs solutions to y00+py0+4y= 0,y(0) = 1, and y0(0) = 2 for p= 8 (distinct real negative roots), p= 4 (a negative repeated root), and p= 2 (complex roots). is a solution to the homogeneous Equation 17.2. By using the intial conditions, y(0) = y0andy0(0) = C1andC2.

If there is only one characteristic root r1of Equation 17.2 ( p2\u00a14q= 0) then both y=er1tand y=t er1tare solutions to Equation 17.2. (Exercise 17.1.2). Furthermore, for any numbers C1andC2 y(t) =C1er1t+C2ter1t(17.8) is a solution to the homogeneous Equation 17.2. As for distinct roots, C1andC2can be found using the initial conditions. C1=y0 C2=y0 0\u00a1r1y0 (17.9) A graph of y(t) =e\u00a12t+ 4te\u00a12t, of Equation 17.5 with p= 4, repeated root r=\u00a12, is shown in Figure 17.2.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 782 In the case of complex roots ( p2\u00a14q <0),r1andr2will be complex numbers a+bianda\u00a1bi respectively, where i=p\u00a11. The algebra and calculus of complex functions conform to the laws of exponents and derivative formulas of real valued functions, and the argument that Equation 17.6 solves the homogeneous equation has exactly the same steps in both real and complex arithmetic. We need to probe e(a+bi)tmore deeply, however. It may stretch your credibility but we will de\u00afne (actually Leonhard Euler found it See Exercise 9.4.6) e(a+bi)t=eatebt i=eatcosbt+ieatsinbt: What is really important to us is that each of the real and imaginary components of e(a+bi)tis a solution to the homogeneous equation. That is and y2(t) =eatsinbt each solve y00(t) +py0(t) will show that y00(t) +py0(t) +qy(t) = 0 functions into y00(t) +py0(t) = 0 We need to show that the last expression is zero and the prospects are grim. However, recall that a+bi is a root to r2+pr+q= 0. We use a complex (2 ab+pb)i= 0 Now we got it! In order for a complex number to be zero, both the real and imaginary components must be zero. Therefore a2\u00a1b2\u00a1pa+q= 0 and 2 ab+pb= 0, expression 17.10 = 0, and y(t) =eatcosbt is a solution to y00(t) +py0(t) +qy(t) = 0. The argument that y(t) =eatsinbtis a solution to y00(t) +py0(t) +qy(t) = 0 is similar to the preceding steps and is omitted. By Theorem 17.1.1, if a+biis a root numbers then y(t) =C1eatcosbt+C2eatsinbt (17.11)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 783 is a solution to y00(t)\u00a1py0(t) +qy(t) = 0. Using the initial conditions the solution of Equation 17.5 with p= 2, roots = \u00a11\u00a7p 3i, is shown in Figure 17.2. You can now solve every second order linear constant coe\u00b1cient homogeneous di\u00aeerential equation with initial conditions. We have not proved that the solutions are unique, but they are unique { there are no other solutions. Please accept the uniqueness as a fact; its proof is beyond our scope. It is important that in each of the cases, distinct real roots, repeated real root, and complex roots a\u00a7bi, two solutions y1andy2of the homogeneous equation were found that are linearly independent. De\u00afnition 17.1.1 Two functions y1andy2are linearly independent means that if a number and C2is a number C1=C2= 0. The assertion C1y1(t) means that for all numbers t; C 1y1(t) +C2y2(t) = 0 For example, in the case of distinct real roots, y1(t) =er1tandy2(t) =er2tare linearly independent. Suppose not, and that there are numbers C1andC2and C1er1t+C2er2t\u00b40 Then h C1er1t+C2er2ti0\u00b40 r1C1er1t+r2C2er2t\u00b40 If we att= that 0 Because r16=r2the equations imply that C1=C2= 0. You may choose to move directly to Section 17.2 ; that section and the material following it does not require the material in Subsection 17.1.2. 17.1.2 The nonhomogeneous equation. There are three steps to solving the nonhomogeneous Equation 17.1 +py0(t) +qy(t) = 0Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 784 as in Subsection 17.1.1. That is, \u00afnd y1(t) and y2(t) such that every solution to the homogeneous equation is of the form C1y1(t) +C2y2(t). Step 2. Find a particular solution yp(t) of the nonhomogeneous equation (ignore initial conditions for this step). Step 3. yg(t) =yp(t) +C1y1(t) +C2y2(t) is a general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. Use the initial conditions y(0) = y0andy0(0) y0 0 forC1andC2. Step 2 is the new step. Step 1 is Subsection 17.1.1. That yg(t) in Step 3 solves the nonhomogeneous equation needs to be checked (Exercise 17.1.3). Important to Step 3 is to involve yp(t) in evaluating C1 andC2. An approach to Step 2. Equation 17.1 is widely useful and a number of techniques to \u00afnd a particular solution have been developed. We present only the most obvious which are based on the assumption that yp(t) should be similar to f(t). If, for example, f(t) is a polynomial, an exponential function or a sine function, then yp(t) should be, respectively, a polynomial, an exponential function or a sine function. This works well unless it happens that f(t) is itself a solution to the homogeneous equation in which case a modi\u00afcation is required. Several examples will show the technique. Problem.

Henceforth our interest will be pairs of di\u00aeerential equations of the form x(0) = = g(x; y);(17.22) We will assume that fandgare continuous and have continuous \u00afrst and second partial derivatives with respect to both variables. This is su\u00b1cient to insure that for any initial values x(0) = x0andy(0) = y0, Equations 17.22 have unique of ( x0; y0) and t= 0. These equations are said to be autonomous because f(x; y) and g(x; y) are independent of t. The homogeneous Equation 17.2, y00+py0+qy= 0 is also autonomous where as the nonhomogeneous Equation 17.1, y00+py0+qy=f(t) is not autonomous. Anequilibrium point of Equations 17.22 is a number pair (xe; ye) such thatf(xe; ye) = 0 g(xe; ye) = 0 :(17.23) If (xe; ye) is an equilibrium point of Equations 17.22 then the pair x(t) = xe y(t) = ye for all t has the property that x0(t) = 0 = f(xe; ye) y0(t) = 0 = =yeis a solution plane Direction Fields.

Also observe the direction \u00afeld in, Figure 17.3A; the direction of motion in the four quarters of the plane is determined by whether x0andy0are positive or negative. Now use Leibnitz easy solution, y=x2+C; y =x2+y0\u00a1x2 0: From this we conclude that every solution curve is part of a parabola, and we have drawn three such parabola's in Figure 17.3B.

The two equilibria ( \u00a11:5;0) and (1 :5;0) in Figure 17.3B are quite di\u00aeerent. Solution curves close to (\u00a11:5;0) stay close to ( \u00a11:5;0) as time increases (see the arrows on the curves). There are solution curve close to (1 :5;0), however, that move away from (1 :5;0) as time increases. The equilibrium ( \u00a11:5;0) is stable (de\u00afned next) and the equilibrium (1 :5;0) is not stable. De\u00afnition 17.2.1 Stable Equilibrium. An equilibrium point, ( xe; ye), of Equations 17.22 is a stable means that if \u00b2is a positive number there is a positive number \u00b1such that if x(t); y(t) are the and t1q (x(t1)\u00a1xe)2+ (y(t1)\u00a1ye)2< ye), of Equations 17.22 is asymptotically stable if there is a positive num- ber\u00b1such that if x(t); y(t) are the x0=y; y0= 2xy shown in Figure 17.3B is stable but not asymptotically stable. To show stability of ( \u00a11:5;0), suppose \u00b2 and we may The case for \u00b2= 0:9 and \u00b1= 0:6 is shown if Figure 17.4A.

All of the equilibrium points ( xe;0) that lie within the circle of radius \u00b1are graphs of solution curves that do not converge to (-1.5,0).

We examine the coe\u00b1cients, ai;j, are constant. The origin is an equilibrium point. We will \u00afnd conditions on the coe\u00b1cients, ai;j, that will insure that the origin is an asymptotically stable equilibrium. We di\u00aeerentiate three Equations 17.29 and and \u00afnd a second order equation that involves only x(t). x00(t)\u00a1(a1;1+a2;2)x0(t) + (a1;1a2;2\u00a1a2;1a1;2)x(t) = 0 : (17.30) Equation 17.30 is a second order linear constant coe\u00b1cient homogeneous di\u00aeerential equation of the form x00(t) +px0(t) +qx(t) = 0 : discussed in Section 17.1.1. The characteristic equation r2\u00a1(a1;1+a2;2)r+ (a1;1a2;2\u00a1a2;1a1;2) = 0 (17.31)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 795 of Equation 17.30 and its characteristic roots are also de\u00afned to be the characteristic equation and roots of the system, Equation 17.28. The coe\u00b1cient a1;1+a2;2of Equation 17.31 is called the trace the A=\" a1;1a1;2 a2;1a2;2;# and the coe\u00b1cient a1;1a2;2\u00a1a2;1a1;2is the determinant of characteristic equation 17.31 is sometimes written r2\u00a1trace( A)r+ det( A) = 0 (17.32) The same characteristic equation and roots are obtained if x(t) and x0(t) are eliminated from Equations 17.28 to obtain a second order di\u00aeerential equation in y(t) (Exercise 17.3.1.) For initial conditions x(0) x0 a1;2y(0) = a1;1x0+a1;2y0: From Equations and 17.7 for distinct real roots, r1andr2, and Equations 17.8 and 17.9 for a repeated root, r, and Equations 17.11 and 17.12 for complex roots a+bianda\u00a1bi, the solution to Equation 17.30 is, From these solutions it is fairly easy to prove the following theorem.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 796 Theorem 17.3.1 Asymptotical Stability of a pair of constant coe\u00b1cient mogeneous di\u00aeerential equations. The origin (0,0) is x0(t) = a1;1x(t) +a1;2y(t) y0(t) = a2;1x(t) +a2;2y(t)(17.36) if the roots of the characteristic equation r2\u00a1(a1;1+a2;2)r+ (a1;1a2;2\u00a1a1;2a2;1) = 0 satisfy one of the three conditions: a. The roots are real and distinct and negative. b. The root is a repeated root and is negative. c. The roots are complex, a+bianda\u00a1biandais negative. Under conditions a. and b. the origin is called an asymptotically stable node and under condition c. the origin is called an asymptotically stable spiral point. Proof. Suppose the roots are real and distinct and negative. We \u00afrst show that (0,0) is a stable equilibrium. From Equations the coe\u00b1cients a1;1,\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2,a2;2such 797 Therefore, (0,0) is stable. From x(t)C1er1t+C2er2tit is immediate that lim t!1x(t) =C1lim t!1er1t+C2lim t!1er2t= 0 because r1andr2are negative. Similarly lim t!1y(t) = 0, and it follows that (0,0) is an asymptotically stable equilibrium of Equations 17.33. The arguments for a repeated root and complex roots are similar and are omitted. End of proof.

It is obvious in Figure 17.5A that all paths lead to (0,0); (0,0) is a stable node of the equations A. There are two negative characteristic roots, -0.5 and -0.3, and the solution is x(t) =x0e\u00a10:5tand y(t) =y0e\u00a10:3t. In Figure 17.5B only two paths lead to (0,0).

All of these systems have complex characteristic roots. The spiraling around the origin is typical of complex roots.

This theorem together with Theorem 17.3.1 provide a direct computational means to determine whether an equilibrium point is asymptotically stable. Its proof is beyond our scope, but it is easily understood and we use the theorem. We will apply it to several systems in the next section. Example 17.4.1 (Continued) Equations 17.39, x0= (169 \u00a1x2\u00a1y2)=10 y0= 17 \u00a1x\u00a1y(17.44)Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 803 has two equilibrium points, e1= (5;12) and e2= (12 of the Jacobian are -2 and -7/5, respectively, and the characteristic roots of the local linear approximation to Equations 17.44 ( the roots to r2+ 4 + 0:4413; and r2=\u00a12\u00a1q 4 + 49 =25 2:=\u00a14:4413: Because one of the characteristic roots is positive we do not conclude that Equations 17.44 are asymptotically stable.

This example is patterned after a model Anderson and May2present to suggest that antibody level may switch from a lower level stable unexposed state to an upper level stable actively immune state . 17.5 Applications of Theorem 17.4.1 to biological systems. Simple population models of competing species and predator-prey relations introduced by Alfred Lotka and Vito Volterra in the 1920's have formed the basis of discussion of stability and local stability. 17.5.1 Competition. Assume there are two species, xandy, with populations sizes x(t) and y(t) that compete for the same food. We write x0(t) = rx\u00a3x(t)\u00a3(1\u00a1ax(t)\u00a1by(t)) y0(t) = ry\u00a3y(t)\u00a3(1\u00a1cx(t)\u00a1dy(t))(17.45) Ifbandcare zero, there is no competition and x(t) and y(t) grow in a logistic manner with maximum population sizes 1 =aand 1 =d, respectively. In some formulations aanddare zero so that without competition, x(t) and y(t) grow exponentially. The number bmeasures the e\u00aeect of yonxand in a sense measures how much the maximum supportable xis reduced in the presence of y. Similarly, cmeasures the e\u00aeect of xony. Depending on the parameter values, there may either be an equilibrium point ( xe; ye) with both xe>0 and ye>0 so that both populations exist 'in harmony,' or one population may be so competitive that the other is driven to extinction. The equilibrium points of Equations 17.45 are found by solving x0= 0 f(x; y) = rxx(1\u00a1ax\u00a1by) = 0 y0= 0 g(x; y) = ry\u00a3y\u00a3(1\u00a1cx\u00a1dy) = 0 There are four solutions if ad\u00a1bc6= 0. x= 0; y = 0 x= 2ibid., p 36Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 805 The equilibrium (0 ;1=d) signals xis not present and yis at its maximum supportable level. Similarly (1=a;0) signals that xis at its maximum supportable population and yis not present. The Jacobian matrix of f(x; y) =rxx\u00a1rxax2\u00a1rxbxy and g(x; y) =ryy\u00a1rycxy\u00a1rydy2 computed partial = f y) = y) = y(x; = ry\u00a1rycx\u00a12rydy : The Jacobian matrices at the \u00afrst three equilibrium are (1 : equilibrium (0,0) is nonstable. The trace of the Jacobian matrix is rx+ryand is positive and if (x0; y0) is close to (0,0), (a small number of each of xandyis introduced into the environment), (x(t); y(t) will move away from (0,0). (In fact, both x(t) and y(t) will initially increase.) The equilibrium (0 ;1=d) is ambiguous. If 1 \u00a1b=d < 0 then the trace of the Jacobian matrix, rx(1\u00a1b=d)\u00a1ryis negative and the determinant, rx(1\u00a1b=d)\u00a3(\u00a1ry) is positive. In this case, (0 ;1=d) is a stable node. This is bad news for x. It means that if yis established (is at its maximum supportable population) and a few members of ximmigrate, those members of xwill not have enough o\u00aespring to become established; x(t) will decrease to zero. The condition 1 \u00a1b=d < 0 implies that b\u00a31=d > 1. Recall that bmeasures the competitive in\u00b0uence ofyonxand 1 =dis the maximum supportable ypopulation. If the product of these two numbers is larger than 1, then ycan exclude xfrom the region. If 1\u00a1b=d > 0 the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is positive, both roots are real and at least one root is positive. In this case (0 ;1=d) is not stable and a few members of xentering the region will initially increase. In a similar way, (1 =a;0) may or may not be a stable equilibrium point of the system and introduction of a few members of ymay not or may lead to initial growth. In order to understand the equilibrium ( d\u00a1b)=(ad\u00a1bc);(a\u00a1c)=(ad\u00a1bc) we consider three examples. Example 1 Example 2 Example 3 Two sheep : Pig and sheep : Two pigs two examples is that xcompetes more severely with yin Example 2 (1.4) than in Example 1 (0.6), and both compete severely in Example 3. In these examples and generally it is instructive to look at the nullclines ofx0andy0shown in Figure 17.9. The nullclines are the curves along which x0= 0 or y0= 0.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 806 In Figure 17.9A is the single nullcline for x0= 0:1x(1\u00a1x\u00a10:5y) = 0. The graph is the straight line with equation 1 \u00a1x\u00a10:5y= 0 and is marked x0= 0 in Figure 17.9A. For a point above or to the right of that line, 1 \u00a1x\u00a10:5yis negative and x0is negative at that point. Consequently, direction \u00afeld arrows point to the left above the line 1 \u00a1x\u00a10:5y= 0. Whether they point to the left and up or to the left and down depends on y0at that location and one of each type is displayed. Similarly, direction \u00afeld arrows below the line point to the right. Direction \u00afeld arrows exactly on the line are vertical. In Figure 17.9B nullclines for both x0= 0:1x(1\u00a1x\u00a10:5y) = 0 and y0= 0:2x(1\u00a10:6x\u00a1y) = 0. They are the graphs of 1\u00a1x\u00a10:5y= 0 1\u00a10:6x\u00a1y= 0which intersect at (5 =7;4=7) As in Figure 17.9A, direction \u00afeld arrows above 1 \u00a1x\u00a10:5y= 0 point to the left. If those arrows are also above 1 \u00a10:6x\u00a1y= 0, the y0<0 and the arrow point to the left and downward. Arrows below both lines point up and to the right. The four equilibrium points A, B, C, and D are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (5/7,4/7).

A direction \u00afeld for Example 1 appears in Figure 17.10A. It appears that the equilibrium points A, B, and C are nonstable and this follows from discussion above. It also appears that D is a stable node, and we show this next.

The 'equilibrium' point Dhas moved out of the \u00afrst quadrant, and has negative ycoordinate.

The equilibrium point Dreappears in Example 3, as seen in Figure 17.11. But Dis not stable.

The presence of yreduces the growth rate of xand the presence of xincreases the growth rate of y.

Assume there is a virus that is spread by contact from infected individuals to susceptible individuals and that infected individuals recover. Let s(t),i(t) and r(t) denote the numbers of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, respectively. Assume that the rate at which infection spreads is proportional to the number of susceptible and to the number of infected. Also assume that recovered individuals have life time immunity. We write the equations: s0(t) = \u00a1\u00af\u00a3s(t)\u00a3i(t) i0(t) = \u00af\u00a3s(t)\u00a3i(t)\u00a1\u00b0i(t) r0(t) = Ackerman, August 12, 2010 811 The parameter \u00afis crucial. It re\u00b0ects the probability of transmission of the disease and depends on the frequency of contacts between people and the ease of transmission of the disease.

If \u00afs0< \u00b0, then ( s0;0) is a stable equilibrium. If a small number of infected individuals enter the populations with \u00afs0< \u00b0, the disease does not spread. If \u00afs0> \u00b0, then ( s0;0) is an unstable equilibrium. If a small number of infected individuals enter the populations with \u00afs0> \u00b0, the disease will spread.

Exercise 17.5.6 It may be that recovered individuals do not have life time immunity, become susceptible after a period p,and one may write s0(t) = \u00aer(t\u00a1p)\u00a1\u00af\u00a3s(t)\u00a3i(t) i0(t) = \u00af\u00a3s(t)\u00a3i(t)\u00a1\u00b0i(t) r0(t) = \u00b0i(t)\u00a1\u00aer(t\u00a1p) This system is considerably more complex than Equations 17.48, and is simpli\u00afed by i0(t) = \u00af\u00a3s(t)\u00a3i(t)\u00a1\u00b0i(t) r0(t) = \u00b0i(t)\u00a1\u00aer(t) This system involves three functions and three equations and is beyond our exposition. However, you may be able to analyze it.Cornette and Ackerman, August 12, 2010 814 a.Show that ( s0;0;0) is an equilibrium point, for any s0. b.Guess or compute the Jacobian matrix at ( s0;0;0). characteristic values of the Jacobian matrix at ( s0;0;0) are \u00afs0\u00a1\u00b0and\u00a1\u00ae. What is the criterion for an epidemic (the number of infected will increase when a small number, \u00b2, of infected individuals enter a population for then for z(t) and then for x(t). Exercise 17.5.7 Suppose in the SIR Equations 12.4 that \u00afs0> \u00b0so equilibrium and i0=\u00b2where \u00b2is \"small\" and positive.
