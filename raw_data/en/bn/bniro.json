The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine, Moderna Vaccine and other COVID -19 candidate vaccines are designed to prevent infection from SARS -CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID -19 The vaccine activates your body to make antibodies that can block entry of the SARS -CoV-2 into your cellsUNCLASSIFIED 3How does it work? The Pfizer and moderna COVID -19 Vaccines are mRNA vaccines mRNA vaccines take advantage of the process that cells use to make proteins in order to trigger an immune response -COVID -19 mRNA vaccines have been rigorously tested for safety before being authorized for use in the United States -mRNA vaccine technology is new, but has been studied for more than a decade -mRNA vaccines do not contain a live virus and do not carry a risk of causing infection in the vaccinated person -mRNA from the vaccine never enters the nucleus of the cell and does not affect or interact with a person's DNALive VirusUNCLASSIFIED 4How is the vaccine tested? UNCLASSIFIED 5For the Pfizer vaccine, the FDA reviewed the data from over 43,000 individuals 16 years of age and older who participated in clinical trials and found a 90 -97% efficacy in preventing a symptomatic laboratory confirmed infection (the normal benchmark is 50%). The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on December 11, 2020 for use in persons aged 16 years or older . The authorization as EUA means that it is not fully approved and licensed by the FDA. However, an EUA is issued based on the review of the scientific evidence available at this time it is generally safe and effective and that the known and potential benefits of the vaccine when used to prevent COVID -19 outweigh its known and potential risks .Is it Safe?UNCLASSIFIED 6Are there Risks? There are always risks and always unknowns . Known risks and side effects reported for the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID vaccine include: In this case, the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product . fever injection site swelling or redness nausea feeling unwell swollen lymph nodes injection site pain tiredness headache muscle pain chills joint pain There is a remote chance that the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine.UNCLASSIFIED 7What about Unknowns? COVID -19 vaccines are being tested in large clinical trials to assess their safety. However, it does take time, and more people getting vaccinated before we learn about very rare or long -term side effects. That is why safety monitoring will continue. CDC has an independent group of experts that reviews all the safety data as it comes in and provides regular safety updates. If a safety issue is detected, immediate action will take place to determine if the issue is related to the COVID -19 vaccine and determine the best course of action.UNCLASSIFIED 8Are there Risks to not Getting It? By not getting the vaccine, you are at greater risk of getting COVID -19 COVID -19 disease is caused by a coronavirus called SARS -CoV-2. This type of coronavirus has not been seen before. You can get COVID -19 through contact with another person who has the virus. It is predominantly a respiratory illness that can affect other organs. People with COVID -19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness . Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may include : fever or chills cough shortness of breath fatigue muscle or body aches headache new loss of taste or smell sore throat nausea or vomiting diarrheaUNCLASSIFIED 9To protect yourself, your coworkers, your family and your community!Why should I get it?

The vaccines are given in 2 shots 3 -4 weeks apart 3-4 weeks Both doses should be from the same company +Two doses required to achieve high efficacy Pfizer efficacy after 2nd dose: 95.0 % + orUNCLASSIFIED 11 Public Health Practices For now, both vaccinated and unvaccinated persons should continue to follow all public health practices to protect themselves and others, including : -Wearing a mask -Staying at least 6 feet away from others -Avoiding crowds -Washing hands often -Following CDC travel guidance -Following quarantine and ROM guidance -Following Navy COVID Standard Operating Guidance When enough of the population is vaccinated, we should be able to discontinue these measures. 12 M E D I C A L P O W E R F O R N A V A L S U P E R I O R I T Y "}
