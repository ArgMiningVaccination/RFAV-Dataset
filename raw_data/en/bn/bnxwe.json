This makes it a great time to set intentions for personal growth as you begin focusing on the things you will accomplish in the coming months. Your own health and wellness is an awesome place to start because it will support you in all of your other pursuits. During the winter months, we tend to eat more highly processed and convenient foods so by early March many of us are in need of a detox. By eating foods that are energy-packed and nutritious, we can start off the new season on the right foot. Detoxifying Foods Some examples of detoxifying foods are: broccoli, asparagus, beets, berries, olive oil, oatmeal, nuts, legumes, ginger, turmeric and citrus fruit. These foods are rich in antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, which will provide your body the flow of nutrients it craves. Drinking plenty of water each day is also essential for a detox. [The C.D.C. recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db242.htm) that men drink 3.7 liters of water per day and that women drink 2.7 liters per day. Find out how much water your favorite water bottle can hold and fill it up as many times as necessary throughout the day.
