But why is there censorship of early interventions and also of doctors writing scripts for them? Why are we being pitted against each other? Dr. Ruwart has been in the pharmaceutical industry for many years, run for the presidential primary on the Libertarian ticket, and is author of three books, one on how the FDA became what she thinks it is today. This is a tell-it-like-we-think-it conversation. Mary J. Ruwart, Ph.D. chairs a for-profit IRB and is a former research scientist in the pharmaceutical industry. She has a B.S. in biochemistry and a Ph.D. in Biophysics from Michigan State University. She did post-doctoral work at the St. Louis University Medical School's Department of Surgery and became an Assistant Professor of Surgery before joining the Upjohn Company. Science is always changing, and we are in a circumstance that is evolving, but it seems that the \"narrative\" of much of the media is not representing accurately both sides of the science. Turns out there are details not widely discussed on most TV or radio shows. You will hear some of that here including: Who is most apt to die from Covid and why. What does obesity have to do with it. Is heart damage happening more in vaccinated young adults than from Covid. Why getting two boosters a year exposes you to the \"inflammatory spike\" protein. The Covid spike protein binds to human tissues than any other animal the bat it derives from, and this is very unusual and makes us wonder about human gain-of-functioning engineering. We are seeing a level of censorship worldwide - bigger than we have ever seen before, even in the medical journals which are thus becoming untrustworthy now. So, in this show we ponder what is going on. Did you know that the Pfizer submission to FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is still under EUA? The full approval has been for Biotech - in this show Dr. R. discusses the difference. You cannot have a vaccine on an EUA if there are already \"early effective interventions\". Critical to keep in mind. We discuss the veracity of VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) and why this is not being discussed, tracked, and Dr. R's interpretation of the numbers. Dr. Ruwart believes, teaches, and writes that \"Whoever controls your body, controls your mind.\" Think, read, question, debate, learn... but stay calm. And informed. Dr. Ruwart says, \"If the vaccine works, then you don't need to worry about an unvaccinated person. If the vaccine doesn't work, it makes no sense to have a mandate. Especially with something so new.\" Dr. Ruwart says the research on the children 5 to 12 years old was done on a group of 2000 children. None in the experiemental nor placebo arm during this time got Covid. 5% of the children were lost to follow-up. Is this enough safety data to inject our children? Dr. Ruwart says it is something to ponder. We discuss blood labs to see if heart damage is occurring and suggest nutraceuticals to take prophylactically, especially in children and young adults, that may be heart-protective - if you decide that moving forward is the best way to go. These are suggestions based on physiology, not studies. Many studies are included below for your personal reading.

Dr. Whitfield is an experienced, Board Certified Plastic Surgeon who specializes in oncologic breast reconstruction. But he was also the doctor to discover that some cases of autoimmunity, chronic fatigue, cognitive decline... start in contaminated breast implants! Dr. Whitfiled completed six years of surgical training at Indiana University Medical Center. Then a Plastic Surgery Residency. And then a Fellowship in Microsurgery and Aesthetic under Dr. William Zamboni. Dr. Whitfield began to have patients that were experiencing systemic illness, and when he removed their implants, called an \"explant\" procedure, he found identifiable pathogens in the tissue capsule. Treating these infections got rid of many of these systemic problems, such as chronic fatigue. This lead Dr. Whitfield to start to add more services for his clients, including nutritional and nutraceutical advice as well as personal genetic predisposition screening. Dr. Whitfield has completed over 4000 breast procedures since 2004 including over 500 implant removals. He has the largest series of explant specimens with PCR testing. This tests the genetic sequences of pathogens, so is a highly sensitive test to identify \"stealth\" infections and find their appropriate medications to eradicate them. While serving as the President Elect of the Research Foundation Dr. Whitfiled also gave testimony at the FDA hearings in 2019 regarding Breast Implant iIlness (BII). - [\"Unfunc Your Gut\" with Functional Medicine M.D. Dr. Peter Kozlowski (#230)](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/unfunc-your-gut-with-functional-medicine-m-d-dr-peter/id1137810905?i=1000539654843) \"Unfunc Your Gut\" with Functional Medicine M.D. Dr. Peter Kozlowski (#230) Gut health rules the basis of health.

Dr. DeRosa also trains physicians. In 2018, she launched The Hormonal Health Institute: Executive Instruction for MedicalProfessionals, a hormonal healthcare consultancy designed to instruct medical providers and provide practice development training on bioidentical hormone replacement therapies.

In this show you will learn: Males have multiple forms of FDA approved testosterone, while women have known. If the FDA succeeds in blocking compounding pharmacists from compounding bioidentical hormones, there will be NO testosterone replacement available for women! Why testosterone is one of the most important hormones for aging women. How (and why) big pharma is lobbying against bio-identical HRT The importance of custom tailoring hormone treatments instead of using a \"one size fits all\" approach. Why your doctor \"must\" track FSH and SHBG when prescribing you hormones. Why you want to achieve a \"pre-menopausal\" FSH level, to improve if not normalize your blood pressure, waistline, bone density, cognition and more. Not to mention your vocal cords, to avoid \"little old lady\" voice. The gender gap in healthcare. How a lack of transparency in the FDA puts patient health at risk. The evidence demonstrating compounded hormones work for millions of people. This is a must-hear conversation between two amazing women who hormone therapies have saved their own lives as well as patients they collaboratively serve. CONNECT WITH DR.

Especially about hormones. Including testosterone. Too many men are taken off Testosterone (T) if they get a diagnosis of prostate cancer or heart disease even though the science shows otherwise. Today's interview is with Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, Harvard urologist and world expert on Testosterone, who has done much of this science. This is a must hear conversation on hormones and health that you will want to share with your physicians and patients.

In this show you will learn: That T does NOT drive prostate cancer. How this myth started and has incorrectly affected medicine for 80 years. The known and unknown symptoms of low T. The issue with just looking at total testosterone and why you must run \"free testosterone\" and also \"SHBG\". What lizards and men have in common? The unappreciated role of hormones in overall health and why so often our doctors don't realize this or take this into consideration when treating us.
