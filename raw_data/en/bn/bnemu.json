In recent decades its practice has gained popularity in the United States. With increasing evidence of its clinical ef cacy, acupuncture is now a widely practiced treatment modality in complementary and integrative medicine. According to the 2007 NationalHealth Interview Survey, an estimated 3.1 million US adults and 150,000 children had acupuncture in theprevious year. The National Health Interview Survey also estimated that between 2002 and 2007,acupuncture use among adults increased by approximately 1 million people. Patients want more information from their clinicians about the use of acupuncture and its safety and ef cacy. Although many clinicians may recommend acupuncture, they often believe they are not suf ciently informed to discuss acupuncture with their patients. This article provides answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding acupuncture. \u00aa2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research nMayo Clin Proc. 2013;88(10):1141-1146 WHAT IS ACUPUNCTURE?Acupuncture is a technique of insertion and manipulation of ne needles in speci c points on the body to achieve therapeutic purposes. Acupuncture has beenpracticed widely in China for more than 4000years and is an integral part of traditional Chi-nese medicine. It was rst described in the med- ical writings The Yellow Emperor 's Classic of Internal Medicine 1around 200 BC. As early as 5000 years ago, stones were sculpted andformed into crude needles to be used as medicalinstruments. 2In time, other materials, includingbamboo, sh bones, bronze, gold, and silver, have been re ned into acupuncture needles. Acupuncture is based on the idea that living beings have an inner energy, known as Qi(pro- nounced chee), and it is the flow of this inner energy that sustains them. According to tradi-tional Chinese medical philosophy, balancedQi is vital to optimal health; illness and diseaseare caused by the imbalance or interruption in the flow of Qi. Although acupuncture was developed for prevention of illness, it is useful in managing disease symptoms by reintroduc-ing balanced flow of Qi, its main focus.From the Division of General Internal Research1141CONCISE REVIEW FOR CLINICIANSJesuit missionaries introduced acupunc- ture to Europe in the 17th century, when they returned from China. The Jesuits wereactive in disseminating the idea and practiceof acupuncture throughout Europe. In addi-tion, traveling physicians helped pioneeracupuncture use in Europe. 3 In the United States, acupuncture gained public and professional attention in 1971, when New York Times reporter James Reston wrote about his experience with acupuncture after an emergency appendectomy in China.4 The operation was a success, but Reston soonhad a considerable amount of postoperativepain and bloating. To provide relief, Chinesephysicians offered acupuncture as a therapeuticmodality. Reston, impressed by the effective- ness of this \"ancient \"procedure, described the overall improvement of his symptoms with no recurrence afterward. Through his news-paper article, he exposed countless Americansto acupuncture for the rst time. HOW MIGHT ACUPUNCTURE WORK?Anatomically, acupuncture points have been reported to correspond to cutaneous areas of high electrical conductivity and distinct histo-logic differences compared with adjacent tis-sue. 5There are many theories that may explain how acupuncture works. Gate Control Theory of Pain This theory postulates that speci c nerve bers transmit a pain signal to the brain via the spinalcord, and input of other nerve bers can inhibit the pain signal transmission. 6Acupuncture is thought to stimulate inhibitory nerve bers for a short period, thus reducing transmissionof the pain signal to the brain. Endorphin Model During the 1970s, researchers isolated endog- enous endorphins in the central nervous sys- tem. Clinical studies reported that insertingacupuncture needles into speci c acupuncture points triggered the production of endorphinsin cerebrospinal fluid after patients underwent acupuncture treatments. 7-9The pain-alleviating effects of acupuncture were reduced whennaloxone was used to pretreat the patient, which may indicate that acupuncture-induced anal- gesia may be partly mediated through endoge-nous opioids. 10Recent research has found that traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture therapy has adirect effect in the up-regulation of m-opioid receptor binding availability in the central ner-vous system compared with placebo (sham)acupuncture. 11This nding may help explain some of the analgesic effects seen with acu-puncture therapy. Neurotransmitter Model Research in animals has found that acupunc-ture can modulate serotonin, norepinephrine,and neurons that transmit or secrete g-amino- butyric acid. 12-15It is postulated that through the neurotransmitter acupuncture canbe efcacious for treatment of depression, anx- iety, and addiction. Other Theories Other theories postulate that acupunctureindirectly in fluences the autonomic system. Acupuncture treatment can affect respiration,heart rate, blood pressure, circulation, and im-mune function. 16Research indicates the in- creased electrical conductivity of tissues along acupuncture meridians.5This result suggests that manipulation of the acupuncture merid- ians with needles may modulate the transmis-sion of certain signals within the body. Thecurrent scienti c theories provide a basis for stating that acupuncture has an effect on thenervous system, but its effects cannot be ex-plained with a single mechanism. IS ACUPUNCTURE SAFE? Modern acupuncture needles are thin and flex- ible and are made of solid surgical stainlesssteel. Unlike hypodermic needles, acupunctureneedles are nely tapered, allowing them to slide smoothly into the skin ( Figure ). Certain acupuncture needles are thinner than theaverage strand of human hair. Acupuncture in the developed parts of the world involves single-use, disposable needlespackaged and sealed by the manufacturer insterile conditions. Although case reports havehighlighted major adverse events, such as or-gan puncture, infections, and bleeding compli-cations, more recent, larger cohort studiesusing universal precautions have not found a signi cant complication rate. In a 2001 study of more than 34,000 acupuncture treatments in the United Kingdom, no serious adverseMAYO CLINIC dis- ability, or death) were reported in relation to acupuncture therapy, and the rate of underly-ing minor adverse events (eg, nausea, fainting,prolonged aggravation of existing symptoms,and psychological or emotional reaction) wasreported to be between 0 and 1.1 per 10,000treatments. 17Acupuncture involves punc- turing the skin, and therefore slight bruising, bleeding, or soreness at the acupuncture site may occur because of needle penetrationthrough capillaries. More serious adverse ef-fects, such as a vasovagal response with adecrease in blood pressure and syncope, havebeen reported. Infections may occur at the nee-dle site from the use of nonsterile needles.When herbs are burned too close to the skin, burn injuries can result around the needle site. Most patients communicate a sense of relaxa-tion and well-being after a treatment. Acupuncture is generally considered safe for persons with bleeding disorders or takinganticoagulants. However, it is important forthe patient to advise the practitioner of thesefacts so the practitioner can use vigilance in selecting insertion points. Acupuncture during pregnancy is a matter of continued debate.Certain acupuncture points are contraindi-cated because they may induce uterine con-tractions and premature labor. WHAT CAN PATIENTS EXPECT AS PART OF THEIR TREATMENT? Every acupuncture practitioner has a distinctstyle and approach. Generally, a treatmentsession involves an initial visit that consists of a patient questionnaire, verbal inquiry, and a focused physical examination. Withthe use of this information, a diagnosis and atherapy plan are established. Patients are usually surprised to learn that acupuncture is associated with minimal or nodiscomfort. Some patients feel a slight pinch asthe needles are inserted, but many feel no pain at all. As the needles are advanced to the indi- cated depth, several sensations may occur,including pressure, heaviness, and warmth atthe needle site. After the insertion of acupunc-ture needles, stimulation of the site of theseneedle insertions often is necessary. The nee-dle may be stimulated manually with gentletwisting back and forth and with slight move- ments up and down. Heat also may be used in various ways to stimulate the needle point,including moxibustion, in which an herb isburned near the acupuncture point or on theneedle itself. Another technique of using heatis to include an indirect heat source, such asan infrared heat lamp, projected over thearea of needle points. A low-intensity electric current may be connected to a pair of needles to provide another form of needle stimulation.Treatments can last from 30 minutes to anhour, with the needles being retained for 15to 20 minutes. Although many patients may have symp- tom improvement with the rst acupuncture treatment, other patients may not see improve- ment until they have completed several treat- ments. Because acupuncture is individuallytailored to each patient and the patient 's medical condition, the frequency and duration of ther-apy differ. In general, most conditions can betreated with 6 to 12 sessions of acupuncture.The patient may need to return periodicallyfor maintenance treatments to maintain long- term bene ts from acupuncture. IS ACUPUNCTURE COVERED BY INSURANCE?Currently, Medicare does not cover acupunc-ture. Congressman Maurice Hinchey intro-duced the Federal Acupuncture Coverage Actin 1993 to add acupuncture as a bene t covered under both Medicare Part B and the FederalEmployees Health Bene ts program. 18Congres- sional support for the bill was modest initially, FIGURE.

Most recently, the Federal Acupuncture CoverageAct of 2011 was introduced in the House of Rep-resentatives, but it was not enacted. 19 Many commercial insurance providers cover acupuncture treatments, either partially ortotally, but they may place limits on the totalnumber of treatments. Patients should be advised to check their eligibility of coverage before receiving treatment. If the insurance providercovers acupuncture, several questions shouldbe asked to determine eligibility and coverage: dHow many treatments are covered? dWho must provide the acupuncture services? dDo I need a physician referral? dWhat conditions are covered for acupuncture? dWhat are WHO PROVIDES ACUPUNCTURE licensed acupuncturists pro-vide most acupuncture treatments in theUnited States. Although formal training pro-grams differ from state to state, the NationalCerti cation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine has developed rigorouscertication criteria and examination require- ments for licensed acupuncturists. The licens-ing mandates of a state should be checked toensure the quali cations of a practitioner before a patient begins acupuncture treatment by thatpractitioner. With the growth of integrative medicine, more physicians are seeking formal trainingin medical acupuncture. Physicians trained in medical acupuncture may be desirable practi- tioners, especially in complex cases in whichconventional allopathic therapies need to beconsidered in developing an integrative treat-ment plan. The American Academy of MedicalAcupuncture is a physician resource for train-ing and certi cation. WHAT ARE THE COMMON INDICATIONSFOR ACUPUNCTURE? The Chinese people continue to use acupunc- ture as a primary healing modality for the pre- vention and treatment of most ailments. In the United States, physicians and patients mostfrequently request acupuncture as an adjuvanttherapy for managing conditions associated with acute and chronic pain. These conditions range across different neurologic, musculo-skeletal, and gastrointestinal symptoms ( Table ). As acceptance of acupuncture increases withinthe medical community, the scope of acupunc-ture practice will likely broaden to mirror whatis practiced worldwide to include non epain- related conditions. These changing trends are likely to lead to additional research efforts focused on conditions in which a paucity of evi-dence for use exists. WHAT DOES THE EVIDENCE SHOW? Although acupuncture has been used for thou-sands of years in Asia, the research communityhas started studying it only in the past few de-cades. The nature of acupuncture therapy in-volves tailoring treatments to the individualpatient, and thus research on acupuncturehas been dif cult because of variable treatment interventions, techniques, and study size. Meta-analysis studies of acupuncture are limitedbecause of the heterogeneity of pooling acu-puncture treatment data. In 2005, Sood et al 20 analyzed the considerable methodologic diver-sity in the Cochrane systematic reviews onacupuncture, which could introduce biasand complexity when reviewing acupuncture literature. The number of acupuncture studies and randomized controlled trials has increased substantially since the 1997 National Institutesof Health Consensus Conference highlightedseveral medical conditions in which acupunc-ture is effective or may be useful. 21In 2003, a review and analysis of reports on controlled clinical trials by the World Health Organiza- tion identi ed 28 diseases or conditions for which acupuncture has been proved effec-tive. 22With the advent of such technological advances as functional magnetic resonance im-aging, emerging evidence and research havefound much promise in improving the under-standing of acupuncture. Review of acupunc- ture research highlights a number of common conditions in which acupuncture may be ef - cacious ( Table ).

However, there are still challenges on how tofully integrate acupuncture into the Westernmedical paradigm. As acupuncture continuesto withstand the test of time, the medical com-munity must continue to investigate and pro- vide evidence of its merits. Correspondence: Address to Tony Y.
