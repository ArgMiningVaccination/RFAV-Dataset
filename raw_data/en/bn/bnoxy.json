Since April 1997 1the cost of the Royal Family's and the Royal Household's (the Household) travel by air and rail forofficial functions has been met by a grant-in-aid from the Department of theEnvironment, Transport and the Regions (the Department). In the three years sincethat date, expenditure totalling some \u00a339 million has been met by grant-in-aidand in 2000-01, expenditure is expected to be around \u00a35.4 million. This reportlooks at how the Household and the Department administer and control the grantto ensure that value for money has been obtained on behalf of the taxpayer. Ourreport does not cover royal travel by car, which is met by the Civil List,Parliamentary Annuities 2or from the Royal Family's own resources. Our examination covered the period from the beginning of the new grant-in-aidarrangements, in 1997-98, to the most recent financial year 2000-01. Ourdetailed analysis of expenditure and travel trends and data covers the period to1999-2000 because outturn figures for 2000-01 are not yet audited and finalised. 2 Our main findings are: Expenditure charged to the grant-in-aid has reduced by two thirds since the first year of the new arrangements IIn 1997-98 net expenditure charged to the grant-in-aid was \u00a317.3 million but had reduced to an estimated \u00a35.4 million in 2000-01 - a reduction of69 per cent. In each year expenditure was less than the sum voted byParliament and any voted sums not paid over to the Household reverted tothe Department and the Exchequer. 1 Prior to April 1997, the cost of official royal travel by air was met and managed by the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the cost of rail travel was met by the thenDepartment of Transport. In June 1997, the Department of the Environment, Transport and theRegions was formed by the merger of the Department of Transport and the Department of theEnvironment. 2 Parliamentary Annuities are fixed annual amounts paid to members of the Royal Family other than The Queen, principally to meet the costs incurred in carrying out official engagements. The Queenhas, of her own volition, reimbursed the Exchequer for all annuities except those for The QueenMother and the Duke of Edinburgh. The majority of expenditure and savings were on air travel INinety per cent of expenditure, and of the savings since 1997-98, relate to expenditure on air travel, with savings being achieved through thereplacement of Royal Air Force helicopters by the Household's ownhelicopter service, switching to the use of more economical aircraft, and areduction in the rates charged by the Ministry of Defence for use of fixed-wing aircraft of the Royal Air Force's 32 (The Royal) Squadron (referred toas 32 Squadron from this point on). IOver the three years since the new arrangements began, there has been a56 per cent fall in expenditure on air travel, from an initial budget of\u00a317.2 million in 1997-98 (based on actual costs in 1996-97, adjusted toprovide a baseline for the new arrangements) to \u00a37.5 million in 1999-2000.At the same time, there was a six per cent fall in the number of air milestravelled by members of the Royal Family. IReductions in expenditure resulted from the charges for using the fixed-wing aircraft of 32 Squadron, which fell from the \u00a311.8 million originallybudgeted in 1997-98 to \u00a34.2 million in 1999-2000, a reduction of64 per cent. This reflected a reduction in the number of flying hoursplanned and used by the Household, a switch from the larger moreexpensive BAe146 to the smaller BAe125 aircraft, and reductions in the unitcharges for the use of these aircraft. Charges for 32 Squadron are expectedto fall again in 2000-01, to \u00a31.8 million, due to further reductions in the useof, and unit charges for, the Squadron's fixed-wing aircraft. IThe Household also achieved a significant reduction in expenditure byswitching in 1998 from the use of 32 Squadron's Wessex helicopters to itsown helicopter operation, which it set up after reviews which indicatedsavings of up to \u00a32.1 million a year. Between 1997-98 and 1999-2000, thenumber of helicopter hours flown increased, with the new helicopterservice displacing more expensive travel by the Squadron's larger fixed-wing aircraft. The basis of charging for royal use of 32 Squadron needs to be reviewed IThe current system of charges for 32 Squadron, intended to recover the full costs of the Squadron's operation, was agreed between the Ministry ofDefence, the Department, the Treasury and the Household when the newgrant-in-aid arrangements were introduced. In April 1995 The Queen'sFlight and the former 32 Squadron had been combined to form the newSquadron, serving military communications and royal flying roles. Royalflying accounted for a higher proportion of the new Squadron's capacitythan is now the case, and all parties were rightly concerned to ensure thatthe full costs of using the Squadron were taken into account in decisions asto its capacity and use. IHowever, in September 1999, following a review, the Ministry formallyrecognised that the principal purpose of 32 Squadron was to providecommunications and logistical support to military operations; theSquadron's capacity should be based on military needs only; and any royalor other non-military use of irreducible spare capacity was secondary to itsmilitary purpose. Treasury guidance on fees and charges allows for chargesto be set to cover variable or marginal costs when assets (in this case32 Squadron's aircraft) are held on standby for their principal role and canbe made available to other users without detriment to this role. Non-military users of the Squadron other than the Royal Family are charged onlyfor the variable costs of that use. As a result of our enquiries, the Ministry,the Department and the Treasury have now agreed to change the basis of 2executive summaryROYAL TRAVEL BY AIR AND RAIL3executive summaryROYAL TRAVEL BY AIR AND RAIL charging. A change to variable cost charging will benefit the taxpayer, because it allows the Household to use 32 Squadron when the variable costof 32 Squadron is lower than the costs of a charter, so long as 32 Squadronhas planes available. The Household has established effective arrangements for procuring chartered and scheduled flights IExpenditure on chartered flights increased from around \u00a30.9 million in 1997-98 to just over \u00a31.1 million in 1999-2000. Over that period, the totalmiles 3travelled on chartered flights rose by 6 per cent. For chartered flights, the Household seeks quotes from two airlines and a broker. TheHousehold's specification for the charter of aircraft is detailed and exacting,and there are few airlines able to make such aircraft available for hire. TheHousehold told us that it reviews its choice of broker every two years andplans to do so later in 2001. IIn contrast, expenditure on scheduled flights fell by 30 per cent from justunder \u00a30.47 million in 1997-98 to just over \u00a30.3 million in 1999-2000.Over that period, the total miles travelled by scheduled aircraft fell by24 per cent, with a 16 per cent reduction in the cost per mile. For scheduledflights, the Household has a longstanding agreement with British Airways,last negotiated in 1998, which provides a range of discounts on publishedfares. In general, the rates of discount obtained by the Household onscheduled flights since 1998 compare very well with those obtainedelsewhere in the public sector and by companies with a similar volume ofbusiness travel. However, the air travel industry is highly competitive, andairlines may change their pricing structures from time to time. There maytherefore be scope for the Household to take advantage of lower faresoffered elsewhere; whilst members of the Royal Family might expect to flythe flag and use a British carrier, around a third of scheduled flights aremade by staff of the Household. The Household has also reduced expenditure on royal travel by rail IExpenditure on rail travel has fallen by more than half, from an original budget of \u00a31.9 million in 1997-98 to expenditure of \u00a30.8 million in 1999-2000; even though the number of rail miles more than doubled. IThe Household has reduced the cost of the royal train by cutting back thenumber of carriages maintained and operated, from 14 to 9, by rationalisingmaintenance to more accurately reflect coach usage, and by renegotiatingplanning and co-ordination charges with its supplier. IThe Department and the Household appointed consultants to assist in thedisposal of surplus royal train carriages, which had been purchased andmaintained at public expense by the Department and its predecessors. Thesale of these vehicles resulted in receipts of \u00a30.235 million to the Exchequer. The Household and Department have introduced systems to better administer royal travel ISince the new arrangements came into place, to improve accountability and transparency the Household has published an annual report on thegrant-in-aid for royal travel, including audited accounts and a listing ofevery journey costing more than \u00a3500. 3 The Household uses miles travelled by members of the Royal Family as a principal measure of performance. Cost per mile is calculated by dividing all costs, including the cost of journeys by staffof the Household, by the number of miles travelled by Family members. Unless otherwise stated, allreferences in this report to miles travelled and cost per mile are on this basis.ROYAL TRAVEL BY AIR AND RAIL IThe Household has introduced a system to document and to bring cost considerations to bear on decisions about modes of travel for all officialjourneys costing more than \u00a32,500 or which use 32 Squadron, the royalhelicopter or royal train; and a full explanation is required in cases whereonly one option is identified or the preferred option is not the cheapest. IThe definitions of official travel, and of official passengers whose travel ispaid for from the grant-in-aid, are covered in guidance produced by theHousehold. This guidance supersedes guidance issued by the CabinetOffice and in the Financial Memorandum, and has been approved by theDepartment. The guidance does not make clear that \"staff of the Household\"has, since before the grant-in-aid, included all direct employees, as well asexperts and specialists, such as doctors, hairdressers and artists invited bymembers of the Royal Family for a specific engagement. The guidance doesnot include a specific procedure for consultation with the Department incases of doubt, although the Household assured us that this would happenif any significant amounts were involved. IThe Household has instituted systems to collect repayments due in respectof private travel by members of the Royal Family and reimbursable travel byjournalists and others. In general, this system works well but reimbursementcould be speedier and the Household itself needs to retain better records toevidence the amounts to be recharged to the media. 4executive summaryROYAL TRAVEL BY AIR AND RAIL IUnder the terms of the Financial Memorandum, the Department is responsible for ensuring that the grant-in-aid is not drawn down in advance of need.During 1998-99 and 1999-2000, the Household's month-end cash balancefell below its contingency level of around \u00a3300,000 on one occasion. Thiscontingency provision went up from \u00a3250,000 to over \u00a3300,000, althoughaverage monthly expenditure halved from \u00a31.5 million in 1997-98 to\u00a3730,000 in 1999-2000. Even though the surplus funds held by the Householdare banked and earn good rates of interest, it is a precept of governmentaccounting that such balances can be better used by the Exchequer andshould be kept at a minimum. Following our examination, the Department andthe Household have agreed to review the level of contingency. Conclusion and recommendation 3 The Household has made very good progress in making significant reductions in expenditure on royal travel whilst maintaining flexibility and standards ofprovision. At the same time, there is greater transparency and accountability forthis expenditure. Our main recommendation, which has now been accepted,is that the Department, the Ministry and the Treasury should agree that theHousehold's use of 32 Squadron be charged at variable rather than full cost, tobetter represent the cost to the taxpayer and as a basis for deciding betweentravel options to minimise overall costs to the taxpayer. Other, more minor,recommendations are included in the main text of the report and broughttogether at Appendix 1. 5executive summary "}
