Facials along with other treatments can help you keep your skin beautiful and fight the signs of aging. Microneedling is a great treatment to use in conjunction with facials. There are many benefits to combining these two treatments. What Is Microneedling? Microneedling is a process in which tiny wounds are made in the surface of the skin to promote collagen and elastin production. An infusion of natural collagen and elastin will help the skin have a better texture, as well as being plumper. Collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid are all important in the body for keeping the skin healthy and beautiful. During the microneedling procedure, hyaluronic acid is applied to the face during the microneedling to give you a plumper and healthier look. After the microneedling, a relaxing and soothing facial mask is applied. How to Incorporate a Facial A facial can also be done during the microneedling procedure. During a medical facial, serums with vital nutrients and hydrating ingredients are applied to the surface of the skin to improve its texture and appearance. When you get a facial as part of your microneedling procedure, these serums and nutrients are better absorbed by the skin. The serums penetrate into the tiny holes made by the microneedling tool, which allows them to be more effective. You would get the facial between the microneedling and the facial mask.
