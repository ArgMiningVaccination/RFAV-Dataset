Recent studies show it has potent antioxidant benefits and increases blood supply, inhibits bacterial growth and promotes collagen production. Green tea Green tea's medicinal properties are attributed to polyphenols, those found in greet teas are called catechins. Green tea quenches free radicals and has shown protection from UV damage. Preliminary studies also show that green tea may inhibit metalloproteinases (MMP). Honey A natural humectant honey helps to hydrate the skin by attracting water to it. Honey has a number of wonderful properties including anti-bacterial, soothing, promotion of wound healing and antioxidant qualities.

Turmeric (Curcuma longa) Tetrahydrocurcumoids (THC), is the biologically active compound found in turmeric. THCs have been reported to have profound antioxidant benefits, capability of reducing acute inflammation, whilst also having excellent wound healing capabilities. Sandalwood See Sandalwood oil. Vitamins and amino acids Vitamin A (Retinol) A pure form of vitamin A encapsulated in a cyclsystem complex (see Cyclodextrin), to ensure effective delivery and reduce irritation. Retinol is converted into retinoic acid by metabolic processes in the skin. Our skin has specific receptors which identify retinol and convert it into a usable form. Not all retinol will be converted into retinoic acid, and in the case of retinyl palmitate, even less is converted. For this reason excessively high amounts of retinol are not only wasted but also known to cause harmful skin irritation. This in turn creates an inflammatory response, resulting in the unwanted formation of free radicals. Vitamin B3 (Niacinamide) Niacinamide has become a very popular skin care ingredient most notably in whitening, anti-ageing and anti-acne products. It is proven to aid the repair of DNA by increasing cell energy. Vitamin C -Sodium ascorbyl phosphate A stable form of Vitamin C, it is an effective antioxidant, skin lightening agent and stimulates collagen formation for improved skin appearance.

Vitamin C derivatives are stable and do not have the irritation potential of L-Ascorbic Acid. Our Vitamin C derivates include 3-Glyceryl Ascorbate, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid and Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Vitamin E Alpha tocopherol is the main component of vitamin E (D tocopherol). It is an excellent anti-oxidant, however tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) have far superior anti-oxidant qualities. Mixed tocopherols are the combination of D tocopherol and the four tocotrienols. L Arginine An essential amino acid, arginine functions as an antioxidant, aids in collagen production and aids in wound healing. L- Carnosine A naturally occurring amino acid which protects the skin from glycation and oxidation, both of which contribute the cross linking of proteins. Ageing and sun exposure increases cross linking of collagen fibres, which produces visible skin ageing in the form of wrinkling and loss of skin tone. Carnosine has proven to help rejuvenate ageing skin cells. Neodermyl A proline, lysine, and copper complex, Neodermyl helps in the production of collagen. This is true especially in ageing cells, by providing essential amino acids, copper to reactivate the enzyme responsible for maturation of collagen and elastin fibres. Resulting in reduced wrinkle depth and energy for ageing skin cells. Retinoate Retinoic acid is essential to skin health. The benefits of topical application in skin care have been studied with excellent results, especially in ageing skins. Our skin has specific receptors which identify retinol and convert it into a usable form. Retinoic acid helps to refine the texture of skin, improve function, reduce signs of ageing and is effective in the treatment of acne.
