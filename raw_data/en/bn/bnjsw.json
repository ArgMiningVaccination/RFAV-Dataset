The PPCR will collect demographic and clinical data which many centers that deliver proton radiation therapy already collect in routine operations. - [A Study to Evaluate Treating Post-Mastectomy Radiation Injury in Breast Cancer Patients with Adipose-Induced Regeneration of Breast Skin (AIR Breast)](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20462464) Jacksonville, FL The primary purpose of this study is to identify the therapeutic effect of Adipose-Induced Regeneration (AIR) in radiation-induced skin injury of post-mastectomy breast cancer patients. - [A Study to Compare Optimal MRI Timing for Pre-surgical Planning to LINAC-based Therapy](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20509428) Rochester, MN The purpose of this research is to compare two different standard-of-care pre-surgical imaging methods. - [The NeoGlioma Study](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20519962) Jacksonville, FL This study aims to evaluate the safety of preoperative radiosurgery in the treatment of patients with biopsy-proven high grade glioma prior to conventional therapy. Safety is defined as any acute grade 3 (CTCAE v5.0) or greater unplanned adverse event from the time of enrollment until 4 weeks following postoperative radiotherapy. - FL; Rochester, MN The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is an increase in the time of a first occurrence of either: local recurrence, leptomeningeal disease, or symptomatic radiation brain necrosis in patients with brain metastases who receive SRS prior to surgery as compared to patients who receive surgery prior to SRS. - [A Study to Determine the Effects of COVID-19 in Cancer Patients](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20504261) Scottsdale/Phoenix, AZ; Mankato, MN; La Crosse, WI; Eau Claire, WI; Rochester, MN The study aims to characterize patient factors, such as pre-existing comorbidities, cancer type and treatment, and demographic factors, associated with short- and long-term outcomes of COVID-19, including severity and fatality, in cancer patients undergoing treatment. The study also is aimed to describe cancer treatment modifications made in response to COVID-19, including dose adjustments, changes in symptom management, or temporary or permanent cessation. Lastely, evaluate the association of COVID-19 with cancer outcomes in patient subgroups defined by clinico-pathologic characteristics. "}
