Science Behind Some Efficacious Ingredients In The Best Joint Supplements Joint health is an essential part of overall health and quality of life. There are several causes of joint pain, including age, injury, inflammation, and overuse. However, various supplements could potentially improve joint health and reduce symptoms of discomfort. Below we will take a look at some of the best ingredients found in effective joint health supplements and the science behind them: MCT Oil [Studies suggest that regular consumption of MCT oil](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9203050/) can benefit joints in multiple ways. For example, one study concluded that supplementing with MCTs led to significant improvements in knee osteoarthritis symptoms after nine weeks compared to control subjects who did not take MCTs. Additionally, since MCFAs are rapidly metabolized in the liver without contributing to lipid accumulation or generation, they have been found to positively impact body weight management, allowing them to reduce stress on joints due to obesity. Finally, since many MCFA sources contain high concentrations of lauric acid\u2014considered an anti-inflammatory agent\u2014they may act as natural joint lubricants when taken internally or applied topically. Ashwagandha Ashwagandha, also called Indian Ginseng, is an ancient Ayurvedic herb that has long been used in traditional systems of medicine and nutrition to boost joint health. Ashwagandha is a shrub in tropical areas of India, North Africa, and the Middle East. The word \"ashwagandha\" literally translates to \"smell of horse\" because it gives off a distinct aroma similar to horses. Withania somnifera, commonly known as ashwagandha, is a traditional Ayurvedic adaptogenic supplement with various benefits for joint health and overall well-being. [A 2021 preclinical study published in Cellular Physiology & Biochemistry](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29620265/) demonstrated that ashwagandha root extract possesses strong anti-inflammatory properties that could be exploited therapeutically in inflammatory joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial on 43 older adults showed that taking 500 mg/day of Ashwagandharishta (an Ayurvedic formula containing a 3:1 combination of ashwagandha root extract + Shatavari root extract significantly reduced pain severity (assessed by Womac score), range of motion (ROM) score and physical disability score compared to the placebo group. CBD Oil Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid plant. Unlike THC, another well-known cannabinoid found in the same plant, CBD does not produce any intoxicating effects like euphoria or intoxication. Instead, it provides potential therapeutic benefits such as reduced inflammation and improved mood - making it an appealing natural supplement for individuals seeking relief from some medical symptoms. [One study by Wu et al. (2020) investigated the anti-inflammatory properties](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33998900/) of cannabinoids, including CBD, following knee replacement surgery in mice models. The administration of both doses (high and low) significantly reduced TNF- levels compared to controls with no treatment, further suggesting that cannabinoids could be a potential alternative option for managing postoperative-associated joint dysfunction. Vitamin D Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin found naturally in some foods, such as fish and egg yolks, and produced by the body upon exposure to sunlight. It plays a vital role in many bodily processes such as brain development, regulation of calcium levels, promotion of bone growth, strength, and repair. Vitamin D has important implications for healthy joints, with numerous studies indicating its potential to improve mobility and reduce pain associated with arthritis and other joint conditions. Studies have shown that increased vitamin D intake may help to reduce inflammation, improve muscle strength and reduce symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. [A systematic review of published research studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6413222/) demonstrated a correlation between higher circulating vitamin D levels of vitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) and better joint function for those suffering from osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, a study by Singh et al. (2010) indicated that individuals with lower circulating levels of 25 (OH)D3 were at greater risk of developing knee osteoarthritis than those with higher concentrations. The study further suggested that appropriate supplementation could be an effective therapy to reduce this risk factor. Glucosamine Hydrochloride Glucosamine Hydrochloride is an amino sugar derivative of Glucose-amine. It is commonly used in oral supplement form to support joint health, mobility, and overall health. The body naturally produces glucosamine hydrochloride, but when our supplies are depleted due to strenuous physical activity or other stressors, it needs a \"boost\" - made possible by dietary supplementation. Supplementation with oral glucosamine can act on two pathways: forming precursors for cartilage formation and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines in damaged cartilage areas. Since the body can't produce sufficient amounts following injury or disease state, this compound acts both inside and outside of your cells to aid in repairing any damage done (in terms of structure) as well as assisting your tissues to recover more quickly from any strain you may put on them. Astaxanthin Several studies indicate that astaxanthin may be beneficial for joint health. An animal study published in 2012 showed that rats with osteoarthritis had improved joint function when given astaxanthin supplements for six weeks compared to the control group. [Other research suggests that taking 5 mg/day of astaxanthin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7696511/) could reduce osteoarthritis-related inflammation. Studies on human participants have focused on impacts such as increased range of motion and improved physical activity levels when taken over 12 weeks at 4 mg daily. The consensus thus far is that astaxanthin might be beneficial for people suffering from joint pain due to inflammatory conditions such as arthritis; however, more research needs to be done before definitive conclusions can be made about its efficacy as an arthritis treatment. Omega-3 Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat, the main components of which are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These fats possess anti-inflammatory properties, aiding joint health and reducing inflammation related to arthritis or other conditions. [In 2010, a systematic review was conducted to assess the effects of omega-3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7362115/) supplementation on joint pain relief due to osteoarthritis. The study concluded that taking doses higher than 2 grams daily provided significant symptom relief compared to a placebo. It also suggested that those with moderate to severe osteoarthritis may benefit more significantly from higher doses than lower ones. Turmeric Turmeric can help reduce inflammation by inhibiting the body's cyclooxygenase enzymes, which produce inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes in response to injury or illness. It has also been found to inhibit other pathways involved in inflammation. This suggests that its therapeutic effects extend beyond COX inhibition. [Research shows that turmeric](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/) may be especially beneficial when taken orally: those who consume 1-3 grams daily have shown an improvement in markers of inflammation. Aside from this direct effect on inflammatory processes linked to joint stiffness and pain, research suggests supplementing with curcumin may even provide structural protection against degenerative joint diseases. Purslane In traditional medicine systems throughout Asia, purslane has long been used to boost joint health and reduce inflammation associated with arthritis. Researchers have conducted several studies to assess whether there is any truth to this assertion. One study tested the efficacy of oral supplements containing purslane extract among patients suffering from osteoarthritis (OA). After complete supplementation, researchers reported significant improvements in physical function scores for those receiving the treatment compared to the placebo group. Another study found that mice supplemented with dietary purslane experienced reduced levels of inflammation associated with OA compared to control animals. These results suggest that consuming dietary purslane may provide some protection against OA symptoms.
