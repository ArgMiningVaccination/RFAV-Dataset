What is Ayurvedic Treatment [Visiting](https://www.ayurwoman.com.au/locations/) Ayurwoman for Ayurvedic treatments is just like visiting any other healthcare professional. We start with an interview. In the interview, your practitioner will take your detailed medical history, analyze your pulse, tongue, eye and skin. Your Ayurvedic practitioner may also ask you specific questions about your lifestyle, allergies and dietary habits. From the details we gather from you, using Ayurveda theory, we will diagnose your condition. We then suggest a treatment plan for your consideration and agreement.
