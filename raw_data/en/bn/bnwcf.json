While there are trends that claim to be the best for \"detoxing\" or \"rejuvenating\" your body the truth is your body is designed to detox naturally, everyday with the help of the right foods! The main organ that helps the body detox and get rid of toxins is our liver. The liver uses enzymes to remove toxins through bile and urine. Other important organs include our skin and entire digestive system. Our skin is our largest organ and eliminates toxins through sweat and continually repairing with new skin cells. Our digestive system is full of processes that, when in symbiosis, work to eliminate bacteria and food through our stool. It's important to nourish our body with nutrient dense foods that will support these detox organs! 10 HGG Detox Recipes: Below is a list of our favorite HGG Detox Recipes!
