The healing power of sacred sounds coupled with conscious intentions will help reset your energetic rhythms and restore your vital life force energy. Group sound healing can be experienced in-person or remotely. Shamanic Healing I am a practitioner of the Ancient tradition of Dagara Medicine which is a form of Shamanism that originates in Western Africa. Using the wisdom of the 5 Elements, I can help individuals access a state of alignment in their lives where we work in a healthy functional relationship with the elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Nature, & Mineral. Elemental medicine teaches us about how we are in relationship to all things and how Ritual can help us reconnect to our fundamental oneness with All That Is.

Restoring and harmonizing our vital life force energy is key in achieving & sustaining the healing process.

That's a great question and one that I promise to answer in just a moment. But another great question to ask is Who are You? Sure, you may answer this question by telling me your name, but does it tell me Who You Are? Does it tell me your purpose? Your path? Your passions? Does it tell me what makes you tick? What makes you tock? Well, how 'bout this. Take some time to think about that question and when you feel like you have your answer, then let's connect. I would love to know Who You Are. But what if after reading my story you don't have your answer? Then definitely connect with me because I can help you.
