Article 35 Clause 1 mentions 'Every citizen shall have the right to free basic health services from the state, and no one shall be deprived of emergency health services. ' The Public Health Service Act 2018 formulated to ensure the constitutional rights related to health, has defined \"Emergency health services\" as the initial and immediate service to be provided as it is necessary to free the lives of the persons from risk, save the lives or organs from being lost, whose lives are in the risky condition upon falling into unexpected incident or emergency condition.1 Constitutional essence of Emergency health services has been further addressed under Chapter 2 - Rights, Duties of Service Recipients and Responsibilities of Health Institutions, Article 33 of which describes establishment of emergency health service fund, while Article 48 of Chapter 6 describes Emergency health service and management. Furthermore, in the Chapter 4 of Public Health Regulation 2020, Rule 8 commits that 'every health institution shall immediately provide emergency services to patients that have come for treatment in such institution and, if it is necessary, the patient shall be admitted to the hospital' , while Rule 7 ensures that 'if the emergency health services required to treat the patient are not available in a given health institution, the health institution shall immediately provide whatever emergency health services are available, and after providing the reason for additional treatment, the patient shall be immediately referred to the most convenient health institution that provides the required services. ' Towards this, the Ministry of Health and Population has already developed the Basic health services package and some basic emergency health services have already been incorporated in this package. Definition of Emergency Health Services Emergency Health Service is well-defined to encompass, in addition to emergency medical service, the service provided in response to emergency events of public health importance.2 Emergency Medical Services (EMS), also known as ambulance services or paramedic services, are emergency services that provide urgent pre-hospital treatment and stabilization for serious illness and injuries and transport to definitive care.3 The purpose of emergency medical service is to stabilize patients who have a life-threatening or limb-threatening injury or illness.4 These services are established to essentially address the basic principles of first aid, i.e. preserve life, prevent further injury and damage, and promote recovery.

Razzak1 & Arthur L. Kellermann2STANDARD TREATMENT PROTOCOL OF EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICE PACKAGE2Features of the Emergency Health Services The Public Health Service Regulation 2020 states the following important features regarding the Emergency Health Services. (1) Emergency health services shall be as mentioned in Schedule 2 (listed in the Annex I of this document). (2) General hospitals, specialist hospitals, specialised hospitals, teaching hospitals under the Institute of Health Sciences and other teaching hospitals shall provide emergency health services as mentioned in Schedule 2. (3) Ayurveda service centres, specialist Ayurveda hospitals and homeopathy hospitals shall provide emergency health services as per their related medical practices. (4) At least Primary Hospitals shall provide 24-hour emergency health services in accordance with this Regulation. (5) While providing emergency health services, priority shall be given on the basis of the severity of the patient's condition. (6) If the emergency health services required to treat the patient are not available in a given health institution, the health institution shall immediately provide whatever emergency health services are available, and the patient shall be immediately referred to the most convenient health institution that provides the required services, with proper counselling to the patient or his/her visitor/patient party. (7) Every health institution shall immediately provide emergency services to patients that have come for treatment in such institution and, if necessary, the patient shall be admitted to the hospital. (8) Notwithstanding anything mentioned elsewhere in this Regulation, if the patient seeking emergency health services cannot immediately pay the expenses of the treatment, such patient too shall not be deprived of emergency health services. (9) The expenses required in delivering emergency health services as per this Regulation shall be paid pursuant to Section 4 of the Act.5 Rationale of the STP Standard Treatment Protocol (STP) lists the preferred pharmaceutical and non- pharmaceutical treatments for common health problems experienced by people in a specific health system. As such, they represent approach of therapeutically effective and economically efficient prescribing. When implemented effectively, an STP offers advantages to patients (e.g., it provides more consistency and treatment efficacy), providers (e.g., it gives an expert consensus, quality of care standard, and basis for monitoring), supply managers (e.g., it makes demand more predictable and allows for pre-packaging), and health policy makers (e.g., it provides focus for therapeutic integration of special programs and promotes efficient use of funds).6 5. Public Health Regulation 2077 6. Management Sciences for Health and World Health Organization. 2007. Drug and Therapeutics Committee Training Course.STANDARD TREATMENT PROTOCOL OF EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICE PACKAGE3Development Process of the STP The STP has been developed through a series of steps. The Ministry of Health and Population had begun working on the issue of emergency health care right after it was clearly stated in the Constitution of Nepal that no citizen will be deprived of emergency health care. These efforts have been refined and finalized through phase-wise discussions with various stakeholders at different levels. Step 1: A Pre-planning meeting was conducted to start the STP of EHS and mechanism of consultative meetings. The meeting was attended by key government officials from MoHP , Director General of the Department of Health Services, and Directors of the various divisions under the Department, PHRD Nepal and WHO- Nepal. (Participants listed in Annex IV) Step 2: A Consultative meeting with Technical Working Group (TWG) at Curative Service Division was conducted. Members of the TWG provided vital feedback and suggestions (members of the TWG listed in Annex V). Step 3: Preparation and consultative meetings/virtual with MoHP , DoHS, WHO, and national and sub-national experts including staffs of emergency departments (Participants listed in Annex VI). Step 4: A Consultative meeting was done to discuss the first draft of STP with DoHS, MoHP , WHO, PHRD Nepal and subject experts (Participants listed in Annex VII). Step 5: A Consultative meeting about the final draft of STP of EHS was done with senior management team of MoHP , DoHS, WHO, PHRD Nepal, and subject experts, and submission and process for endorsement (Participants listed in Annex VIII). Utilization of the STP The guidelines provided in this Standard Treatment Protocol of Emergency Health Service Package is expected to be useful for all health workers including nurses and doctors and other health-care providers, and health promoters. This can be used to: n Support the emergency health services by developing a national standard treatment protocol in all health institutions. n Ensure that all the necessary equipments and resources are available. The STP is proposed to be used at the following levels of health service as endorsed recently by the Government of Nepal, depending on the resources available: 1. Basic Health Service Centers (BHSC) 2. Primary hospitals (up to 5-15 bedded hospitals) 3. General hospitals (up to 50 bedded hospitals)STANDARD TREATMENT PROTOCOL OF EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICE PACKAGE4Assumptions made for the implementation of the STP While developing the STP of EHS, following implementations will be carried out: 1. The minimum necessary infrastructure and human resources with adequate skill will be available to provide the service. 2. Management of supply/ procurement (supply chain) of necessary medicines and equipment will be ensured, improved and functional. 3. Institution with operational/ implementation plans will be developed to implement the STP of emergency health care. 4. Standard Treatment Protocol of Emergency Health Service package will be oriented to health workers. 5. Each health institution will provide timely emergency health care based on STP . In addition, as emergency health problems can occur at any time, health institutions, including health posts that are not open for 24 hours, will continue to coordinate with authority to develop mechanism to provide 24 hours emergency services. 6. All the levels of government (federal, provincial, local) shall develop emergency plan and enforce it. How to use the STP The STP has been developed to fulfill the need of having a comprehensive guidance to health care providers while treating patients in the Emergency room. The ABCDE approach in the emergency room has been described. The management of Airway, Breathing and Circulation has been elaborated with tables, figures and flowcharts along with the services that are needed to be provided as per the levels of health facilities. Common emergency diseases/conditions, as outlined in the Public Health Service Regulations 2020 Schedule 2 is presented, and are grouped as the following: 1. Respiratory emergencies: Shortness of breath, Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Bronchial Asthma, Pneumonia, Aspiration Pneumonia, Pneumothorax, Hemoptysis, Acute Pulmonary Embolism, Acute Mountain Sickness, High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE), High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE), Acute Respiratory Failure, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) 2.

Each disease/emergency condition includes: a. Introduction b. Causes c. Clinical features (common symptoms and signs of presentation) d. Investigations e. Management and disposition (shown in flowcharts) iii. Management of each disease/emergency condition starts with the resuscitation and initial management in case the patient presents in an unstable condition followed by the recommended pharmacological and definitive management. This includes doses, routes and duration of the pharmacological agent and the active interventions and emergency procedures. It is based on the latest national and international evidence-based guidelines and medical literature, which can be adopted by the health care provider, and bring into practice in the emergency room. iv. Competence of the health care provider, availability of resources including human resources, lab facilities, diagnostics, medications, infrastructure and equipment present in the level of health facility where s/he is working are important factors that affect compliance to this STP . v. Care should be taken for arrangement of referral services when the health care provider is unable to manage the patient either due to lack of experience or the unavailability of necessary resources. Patients should be referred to facilities where the necessary competence, diagnosis and support facilities exist after providing the necessary emergency services and stabilizing the patient. A patient referral form has been provided in the annex. vi. The emergency drug list, referral form, bibliography and list of participants of the various consultative meetings are provided in the annexes.

Airway compromise can occur as sudden or insidious and complete or partial. Airway management should be done in all forms of health facilities as per the resources and manpower available to stabilize the patient before referring the patient to higher centres. For Basic and Primary level facilities (up to 15 bedded hospitals): Positioning n Positioning of the patient supine on a flat, firm surface with the arms along the sides of the body. Unless trauma can be definitely excluded, consider the possibility of a spine injury and stabilize the cervical spine by maintaining the head, neck, and trunk in a straight line. n Talk to the patient. A positive appropriate verbal response indicates a patent airway, intact ventilation and brain perfusion.

It is divided into three types. a. Visceral pain: Described as dull, crampy or achy or can be steady or colicky. Stretching of unmyelinated fibres innervating the organs due to obstruction, ischemia or inflammation results in visceral pain. Embryologic origin Organs Location of pain Foregut Stomach, first and second part of duodenum, liver, pancreas, gall bladderEpigastrium Midgut Third and fourth part of duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ascending colon, first 2/3 of transverse colonPeriumbilical area Hindgut Last 1/3 of transverse intraperitoneal genitourinary organsSuprapubic area b. Parietal pain: Usually acute, due to irritation of peritoneum located above the involved organ. It can be localized to a dermatome superficial to the site of painful stimulus and may develop tenderness, guarding, rebound and rigidity as peritonitis sets in. c. Referred pain: Felt at a location distant from the diseased organ. Eg. Gall bladder pain referred to right shoulder.GASTROINTESTINAL EMERGENCIES4STANDARD TREATMENT PROTOCOL OF EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICE PACKAGE102Diffuse pain n Aortic dissection/Ruptured aortic aneurysm n Early appendicitis Bowel Gastroenteritis n Diabetic Ketoacidosis n Peritonitis n Pancreatitis Right Upper pain n Cholecystitis/Cholangitis/Hepatitis n Myocardial ischemia n Perforated peptic ulcer n Right sided pneumonia Right Lower quadrant pain n Appendicitis n Diverticulitis (caecal) n Ectopic pregnancy n Endometriosis ovarian cyst n Meckel's diverticulum n Psoas abscess n Pelvic torsion n Testicular torsion n Ureteric calculiLeft Appendicitis Ectopic pregnancy Ruptured ovarian cyst n Psoas abscess n Pelvic inflammatory disease n Ovarian torsion n Testicular torsion n Ureteric calculiLeft Upper quadrant pain n Myocardial ischemia n Left sided pneumonia n Splenic rupture n Pancreatitis n Acute gastritis n Gastric ulcerDifferential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain by location:STANDARD TREATMENT PROTOCOL OF EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICE PACKAGE103History: n Pain: Onset, provocative/ palliative factors, quality, radiation, associated symptoms, timing and what the patient has taken for pain. n Concomitant symptoms: Ask for fever, hematemesis/ melena, vomiting, nausea, loose stools, constipation, jaundice, weight loss n Past medical history and medications Clinical Examination: n Vitals n Abdominal Examination a.

It is a serious, life threatening generalized or systemic hypersensitivity reaction. Clinical criteria for diagnosis: Anaphylaxis is likely when any one out of the three criterias are met: Criteria 1 Acute onset of an illness (minutes to hours) involving the skin, mucosal tissue or both (eg. generalized hives, pruritis, flushing, swollen lips, tongue, uvula) AND at least one of the following: 1. Respiratory compromise (eg. dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia) OR 2. Reduced BP or associated symptoms and signs of end- organ dysfunction (eg. hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence) Criteria 2 Two or more of the following that occurs rapidly after exposure to a LIKELY allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 1. Involvement of skin- mucosal tissue (eg. generalized reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia) Reduced BP or associated symptoms and signs (eg. hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence) 4. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and signs (eg. crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) Criteria 3 Reduced BP after exposure to a KNOWN allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours) 1. Infants and children: low SBP (age specific or greater than 30% decrease in SBP). 2. Adults: SBP less than 90 mmHg or greater than 30% decrease from that person's baseline. Causes of anaphylaxis: 1. Drugs, chemical: ACEI 2. Foods: Peanuts, fish, shellfish, milk, eggs, flour 3. Insect sting, saliva: Bees, wasps, hornets, ticks, scorpions, jellyfish 4. Environmental: Pollen, horse dander 5.

These injuries are a hazard to health workers and can occur any time while using hypodermic syringes or related needle equipment. Body fluids which are proven to be more infective in causing infections are blood, semen and vaginal secretions. Similarly, CSF, synovial, pleural, peritoneal fluids are also considered to be potentially infectious. The major pathogens of concern in such occupational body fluid exposure via needle stick injuries and their risks of seroconversion due to sharps injury from a known positive source are: 1. HIV: 0.3% 2. Hepatitis B: 6-30 % C: 2% Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) General Measures: 1. Do not squeeze or rub the injury site. 2. Wash with soap and water for 10 minutes. Alcohol can also be used in case of small punctures since it is virucidal to HIV, HBV and HCV. 3. If mucosa is involved, irrigate with clean running water or normal saline for around 10 minutes. PEP for HIV Indications for PEP: 1. Exposed person is HIV negative 2. Source person is HIV positive, or at high risk of recent infection 3. Significant risk of transmission if: - Parenteral or mucous membrane exposure (sexual exposure and splashes to eye, nose or oral cavity) - Bodily fluids: blood, blood-stained saliva, breast milk, genital secretions, cerebrospinal, pericardial, peritoneal, pleural, etc. - Non-intact skin or mucus membrane exposure to potentially infective body fluidsSTANDARD TREATMENT PROTOCOL OF EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICE PACKAGE248Recommendations for PEP: - Start within 2 hours and maximum within 72 hours. - Duration of treatment: 28 days - Get baseline HIV Antibody test and monitor 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months after exposure. Protocol for HIV PEP (Preferred Regimen): Adults and adolescents (>10years) Children <10years TDF HBs Ag-ve Status therapy dose of HBV Anti HBs titre > 10 milli IU: No therapy < 10 milli IU: 1 dose of HBV vaccine If presenting after 72 hours of exposure, administer only HBV vaccine (0, 1 and 2 months) Check HBs Ag status 6 months and 12 months PEP for Hepatitis C n Wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and clean water for 5- 10 minutes n No PEP STANDARD TREATMENT PROTOCOL OF EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICE PACKAGE249Pain Management in the ED Pain is the most common concern among patients coming to the Emergency Department (ED). Approximately 70-80% of all patients present to the ED as their primary complaint. Pain is the physiologic response to any noxious stimulus. The pain assessment in the ED should determine the duration, location, quality, severity, exacerbating and relieving factors. Pain assessment could be performed by various pain scales. 1. Adjective rating scale No pain Mild pain Moderate painSevere pain Very severe painWorst possible pain - Patient rates pain by choosing from list of pain descriptors, ranging from no pain to worst possible pain. - Easy to administer. 2. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) No pain Worst imaginable pain - A 10cm linear scale marked at one end with 'no pain' and the other end with 'worst imaginable pain' . Severity VAS (0-100 mm) Mild VAS: 0 to 30-40 mm Moderate VAS: 40 to 60-70 mm Severe VAS: > 60-70 mm 1. Numeric pain scale 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 No pain Moderate pain Worst possible pain 2. Wong- Baker FACES Pain Scale No pain Mild Moderate Severe Worst Possible PainSTANDARD TREATMENT PROTOCOL OF EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICE PACKAGE250Pharmacological the mainstay of acute moderate to severe pain management in the ED. These group of drugs have beneficial effects physiologically and should be titrated to effect after the initial dose as patients may differ in their responses to these drugs. Fear of inducing addiction has led the clinician to underuse opioids, however, its short- term use for acute pain management has not shown any dependence. Opioids analgesics commonly used in the ED are: Drug Dose(Adult) Remarks Morphine 2-6 mg IV 10 PO Onset: 1-2 min IV 10-15 hour IM/SC 3-5 hour POCaution: Hypotension - Sedation Fentanyl 50-100 mcg IV Onset < 1 min IV Duration: 30-60 min IVCaution : High dose (> 5 mcg/kg IV) can cause chest wall rigidity Pethidine 25-50 mg IV 50-150 mg IM/SC Onset: 5 min IV Duration: 2-3 hour IVContraindication: In patients taking MAO inhibitors within past 14 days Codeine 30-60 mg PO 30-100 mg IM Onset: 30-60 min 10-30 min IM Duration: 4-6 hour PO and IMCaution : May cause GI side effects like constipation. Tramadol 50-100 mg PO Onset: 1 hour hour POCaution: May cause CNS side effects.STANDARD TREATMENT PROTOCOL OF EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICE PACKAGE251Adjuncts in opioid pain management Adjuncts are used to enhance the analgesic effect, reduce the amount of opioid required and prevent side effects. Drugs Dosing opioid Analgesics These group of drugs are effective against acute mild to moderate pain, however, not effective for chronic pain.

The most common medications used for this purpose are as follows: Drug Indication Dosage Amitriptyline Chronic pain 25-50 mg PO HS Decrease over 2 weeks Carbamazepine Trigeminal neuralgia 100 mg PO BD Increase 100- Duloxetine Diabetic neuropathic pain 30 mg PO OD Increase after 1 week Pregabalin Neuropathic pain Post herpetic neuralgia75 mg PO BD Increase over 1 week NOTE: Caution during pain management in the elderly. Special situations: a) Pain abdomen: Early administration of IV opioids is considered safe for pain abdomen management in the ED. It doesn't affect the accuracy of evaluation or diagnosis. b) Trauma: Trauma with hemodynamic instability can consider IV opioids (e.g. Fentanyl) as their first choice. NSAIDS are mostly avoided due to risk of bleeding from platelet dysfunction or acute renal injury in patients with hypovolemia. Other options: 1. Regional blocks 2.
