Schejter, Ben-Zion Shilo of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel Abstract The release of signaling molecules from neurons must be regulated, to accommodate their highly polarized structure. In the developing Drosophila visual system, photoreceptor neurons secrete the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand Spitz (Spi) from their cell bodies, as well as from their axonal termini. Here we show that subcellular localization of Rhomboid proteases, which process Spi, determines the site of Spi release from neurons. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization of Rhomboid 3 is essential for its ability to promote Spi secretion from axons, but not from cell bodies. We demonstrate thatthe ER extends throughout photoreceptor axons, and show that this feature facilitates the trafficking of the Spi precursor,the ligand chaperone Star, and Rhomboid 3 to axonal termini. Following this trafficking step, secretion from the axons is regulated in a manner similar to secretion from cell bodies. These findings uncover a role for the ER in trafficking proteins from the neuronal cell body to axon terminus.

In polarized cells, such as epithelia or neurons, the unique cellular architecture imposesconstraints on the precise sites where signal release and receptionoccur. For example, the distribution of axonal guidance receptors isrestricted to specific proximal or distal axon segments [1]. Similarly,secretion of molecules from neurons must be highly polarized for theligand to propagate in the appropriate receptive field. In some cases,ligand is secreted along the axon, where it interacts with ensheathingglia [2,3], whereas in other cases ligand is secreted locally from cellbodies or growth cones [4-6]. Thus, polarized secretion is anessential aspect of ligand processing in neurons. An example of ligand secretion from both cell bodies and axonal termini is that of the Drosophila epidermal growth factor (EGFR) ligand Spitz (Spi). In the Drosophila eye imaginal disc, photoreceptors differentiate in the wake of a progressivemorphogenetic furrow, which sweeps from the posterior of thedisc anterior [7,8]. Secretion of Hedgehog (Hh) from furrow [9,10]. Photoreceptor neurons subsequently secrete theEGFR ligand Spi their cell bodies, triggering neurogenesis inclosely neighboring cells [11,12]. Once specified as neurons, R1-R6 photoreceptor axons grow across the basal surface of the eye disc, funnel through the opticstalk, and reach the lamina, where they locally induce the differentiation of lamina cartridge neurons [13,14]. Secretion of Hh from photoreceptor triggers an initial phase ofneurogenesis in the lamina precursor cells, marked by theexpression of Dachshund (Dac) EGFR itself of lamina neurogenesis requires Spi, which isalso locally delivered by the incoming retinal axons. EGFR activation by Spi in the lamina leads to the differentiation of five neurons in each cartridge, which express the pan neuronal markerElaV [6]. Thus, local secretion of Spi at the two distinct poles ofphotoreceptor neurons controls neurogenesis in both the eye discand the lamina. While the mechanisms that regulate Hh delivery to axons have been explored [4], how Spi is secreted from both cell bodies and axonal termini remains unknown. Spi is the cardinal EGFR ligand throughout Drosophila development. It is broadly expressed as an inactive precursor [15]. Spi secretion is dependent reticulum (ER) by aCOPI-dependent mechanism [17]. Trafficking of Spi from the ERto the Rho-1 compartment requires the type II transmembraneprotein Star (S) [18,19]. Upon arrival at this late secretory compartment, Spi is cleaved by the Rho-1 protease and sequently extracellular milieu. Rho-1 also cleaves the chaperone S, thereby rendering it incompetent to traffic additional Spi molecules [20]. We have PLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 1 October 2010 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e1000505previously shown that two additional Rhomboid family members, Rho-2 (also called Stet) and Rho-3 (also called Roughoid [Ru]),which dedicated to oogenesis and eye development, respec- tively [21,22], localize to the ER, as well as to the late secretory compartment [23]. Although Rho-2 and Rho-3, like Rho-1,promote Spi release from the late compartment, their ER presence attenuates EGFR signaling, primarily because of premature cleavage of S [23]. Thus, in photoreceptor neurons, Spi secretionfrom cell bodies is promoted by both Rho-1 and Rho-3 acting in the late compartment, with the ER activity of the latter also attenuating the overall levels of secreted ligand. The presence of ER markers has been observed in axons and dendrites from various neurons [24,25], and the ER has beensuggested to be continuous in Purkinje cell axons [26]. However, the traditional role assigned to axonal ER is in localized translation of transported mRNA, rather than translocation of secretedproteins. Recently, a role for the ER in promoting trafficking of NMDA glutamate receptor to dendrites in cultured rat hippo- campal neurons has been described [27]. Here we examined the mechanisms that regulate Spi release from axonal termini. We find that, unlike secretion from cellbodies, axonal secretion of Spi relies exclusively on Rho-3.Furthermore, the ability of Rho-3 to promote axonal secretion of Spi stems from its combined ER and late compartment localization. Supplementing an ER presence to Rho-1 oreliminating the ER localization of Rho-3 alternates their potencies vis-a `-vis axonal Spi secretion. Our data indicate that the importance of the ER stems from its ability to promote axonaltrafficking of Rhomboids, a feature that we suggest is linked to the extension of the ER throughout the axon. Finally, we characterizethe apical compartment in which Spi is processed in cell bodies, and suggest that it is also present at axonal termini, where Spi is processed following trafficking along the axon. Our results show that subcellular localization of the EGFR-ligand-processing machinery in photoreceptors dictates the polarity of ligand secretion, and highlight the role of the ER in facilitating protein trafficking from the neuronal cell body to the axon terminus. Results EGFR Activation in the Lamina Cartridge Neurons Is Exclusively Mediated by Rho-3 To investigate the requirement for Rho-mediated cleavage in promoting Spi release from photoreceptor axons, we assessed the effect of rho-1 lamina neurogenesis. In activation by Spi delivered fromphotoreceptor axons leads to the expression of the pan-neuronal marker ElaV at the posterior part of the lamina (Figure 1A and 1B). Visual systems rendered homozygous but ElaV expression in the lamina is not perturbed (Figure 1C). Thus, rho-1 is dispensable for Spi release from photoreceptor axons. We next examined ElaVexpression in rho-3 EGUF clones (Figure 1D) or in homozygous mutant animals (Figure 1H). While ElaV is properly expressed inthe eye disc and brain lobula, we could not detect any ElaV expression in the lamina, indicating that rho-3 is essential for EGFR activation in this tissue. Thus, whereas Rho-1 and Rho-3 can redundantly promote Spi release from cell bodies in the eye disc, only Rho-3 mediates EGFR activation in the lamina. Since Rho-3 is also involved in photoreceptor neurogenesis, the lack of EGFR activation in the lamina of rho-3 mutants may be a secondary effect of defective neuronal development or axonal mistargeting. However, rho-3 mutant photoreceptors properly express the 1D 9and unpublished data; [23]), demonstrating that the general program of photore-ceptor differentiation is not perturbed. The only defect we observed at the larval stage is an extra number of neurons, at the expense of non-neuronal cells [23]. Importantly, no overt axonal targeting defects were detected in the mutant, as seen with anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) staining (Figure 1D). Further- more, the of the Hh target genes dac (Figure 1D 99) and EGFR (Figure 1E) in the brain reveals that there is no general secretion defect in rho-3 mutants. It thus appears that the rho-3 mutant phenotype reflects a specific defect in processing and secretion of Spi from axon termini. To critically test the functionality of rho-3 mutant photorecep- tors, we performed electroretinogram (ERG) recordings on adult flies (Figure S1). Photoreceptor neurons from wild-type or rho-3 eyes properly depolarize in response to light. However, ''on/offtransients,'' which represent the activity of the post-synaptic lamina neurons [29], are absent in rho-3 ERG recordings, thus reflecting the defects in lamina neurogenesis. Conversely, ''on/offtransients'' are detected in rho-1 EGUF clones. Hence, in the absence of Rho-3, Rho-1 facilitates all aspects of photoreceptordevelopment, but not the induction of EGFR activation in the lamina. Release of Spi from Axon Termini Depends on Cleavage by Rho-3 in Photoreceptor Neurons Rhomboids promote EGFR signaling by processing the ligand Spi in the signal-sending cell prior to its secretion [30,31]. This suggests that the lack of EGFR activation in rho-3 mutant laminaeAuthor Summary Cells secrete signaling molecules that trigger a variety of responses in neighboring cells by activating their respec- tive cell-surface receptors. Because many cells in an organism are polarized, regulating the precise location ofligand secretion is important for controlling the positionand nature of the response. During the development of the compound eye of the fruit fly Drosophila , for example, a ligand of the epidermal growth factor family called Spitz (Spi) is secreted from both the apical and basal (axonal)poles of photoreceptor cells but with different outcomes. Photoreceptor cells are recruited to the developing eye following apical secretion of Spi. Conversely, basalsecretion of this same ligand, at a significant distance from the cell body, triggers differentiation of cells in the outer layer of the brain. Although secretion of Spi is knownto occur at both poles of the cell, one important questionis how Spi and its processing machinery are trafficked throughout the length of the photoreceptor axon to achieve basal secretion. In this study we show that the keyto axonal trafficking is the regulated localization of Spi andits processing machinery, including the intramembrane protease Rhomboid, to sites within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which extends along the length of theaxon. Two different Rhomboid proteins are expressed inphotoreceptor cells, but only one of them is localized to the ER. We show that this ER-localized Rhomboid is indeed necessary and sufficient for Spi processing at axon termini.Our work therefore demonstrates how variations in intracellular localization of conserved signaling compo- nents can alter signaling outcomes dramatically. It alsohighlights the importance of the ER in trafficking proteinsalong the axon.Polarized Secretion of EGF Receptor Ligand PLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 2 October 2010 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e1000505Polarized Secretion of EGF Receptor Ligand PLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 3 October 2010 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e1000505stems from a failure in cleavage and secretion of Spi from photoreceptors. To follow Spi processing and secretion, we monitored the localization of Spi-green fluorescent protein (GFP), a biologically active variant of the ligand, tagged by GFP at the extracellular domain [19]. The construct was expressed under the control of GMR-Gal4 [32], to restrict expression exclusively to the eye disc. Inspection of EGFR distribution in the laminae of wild-type flies reveals many endocytic puncta, which are associated with the ElaV-expressing cartridge neurons (Figures 1E and S1D). Wefound that Spi-GFP from the in the lamina with EGFR in these puncta, reflecting the release of the ligand from photoreceptor axons and endocytosis of ligand- receptor complexes by lamina cells (Figure 1F and 1J). This co- localization is dependent on cleavage by Rhomboid proteases,since a similarly expressed Spi-GFP construct in which the Rhomboid cleavage site was mutated [33] failed to co-localize with the receptor (Figure 1G and 1K). We next examined the distribution of EGFR in rho-3 mutant laminae, and found that it is uniform compared to wild-type, and lacks the bright endocytic puncta (Figures 1H and S1E). In rho-1 mutant visual systems, the distribution and intensity of laminar EGFR staining were comparable to wild-type (Figure S1F). Furthermore, following expression of Spi-GFP in rho-3 mutant eye discs, GFP-positive puncta could not be detected in thelaminae (Figure 1I and 1K). These results indicate that Rho-3 cleaves Spi within the transmembrane domain in photoreceptor neurons, to promote ligand release from their axons to the lamina. In summary, our results show that, whereas both Rho-1 and Rho-3 are capable of mediating Spi secretion from cell bodies inthe eye disc, only Rho-3 promotes the secretion of Spi from photoreceptor axons to lamina. Spi from R2 and R5 Photoreceptor Axons Patterns the Lamina Each of the approximately 750 ommatidia in the Drosophila eye contains eight photoreceptor neurons of distinct identities. R1-R6 neurons project their axons to the lamina, whereas R7 and R8 project their axons to the medulla. To ask which of these neurons provides Spi for patterning the lamina, we used a repertoire of Gal4 lines to drive Rho-3 expression in different subsets of photoreceptors, and monitored their ability to rescue the rho-3mutant phenotype. All Gal4 drivers used are normally expressedinrho-3 mutant eye discs (unpublished data). As a complementary assay, we expressed Spi-GFP with the same lines, and monitoredits co-localization with the internalized EGFR in the signal-receiving lamina neurons. Our findings are summarized inTable 1, showing that Rho-3 acts to promote Spi secretion fromthe axons of R2 and R5. We note that these axons also play apivotal role in axonal pathfinding, as their mistargeting can guidance the lamina suggests that the difference betweenthe photoreceptors that do or do not provide the signal lies in theirability to process or secrete Spi, rather than in the capacity of thelamina cells to respond only to Spi that is secreted from distinctphotoreceptors.Figure 1.

(D) Large rho-3 clones eliminate EGFR activation in the lamina. ElaV expression is missing from the lamina (inset). Note that ElaV is still expressed in the eye disc, indicating that Rho-1 and Rho-3 redundantly mediate Spi secretion from cell bodies.

However, we have found no rho-3 RNA in axons, even after Rho-3 overexpression, which rescues the rho-3 phenotype (Figure S2). We have previously shown that Rho-1 and Rho-3 differ in their subcellular localization within photoreceptorcell bodies. When ectopically expressed with the Gal4-UAS system, Rho-1 localized to apical punctate structures, whereas Rho-3 was localized to the ER, as well as to the apical puncta [23].We set out to test the hypothesis that the distinct intracellularlocalizations of Rho-1 and Rho-3 account for the difference intheir capacity to trigger Spi processing and secretion in photoreceptor axons. First, we examined the endogenous localization of the two proteases, without resorting to overexpression. Since antibodies that recognized the endogenous proteins could not be raised, we used recombineering [35] to generate ,45-kb genomic fragments Rho-1-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and Rho-3-GFP in patterns and levels identical to the endogenous proteins.Transgenic lines were generated, in which the recombineered genes were inserted at the same chromosomal location. In the eye disc, genomic Rho-1 (gRho-1)-YFP localized exclusively to theapical compartment, whereas gRho-3-GFP was enriched in theER, with staining also at the apical compartment (Figure 2A and2B). These distributions demonstrate that despite the caveats associated with overexpression, the localizations obtained previ- ously by the UAS-Gal4 system faithfully reflected the endogenouslocalization of these proteins. To identify the sequences mediating the subcellular localization of Rhomboids, we swapped different fragments between Rho-1and Rho-3. The resulting chimeras were GFP tagged, andtransgenic animals were generated. In all cases the constructswere inserted at the same genomic location, to avoid a differencein expression levels. We find that the subcellular localization of Rhomboids depends on their cytoplasmic N terminus and the first intraluminal loop. Replacing these fragments of Rho-1 with thecorresponding fragments from Rho-3, to yield GFP-R3L1-R1,relocalized Rho-1 to a Rho-3-like distribution, encompassing theER and apical compartment (Figure 2C and 2F). Conversely, Rho-3 in which the N terminus and first loop were replaced by those of Rho-1 (GFP-R1L1-R3) retained localization to the apicalcompartment, but was absent from the ER (Figure 2D and 2E).Importantly, since the active site of the proteases is formed byresidues embedded within the fourth and sixth transmembrane helices [36-38], the chimeras uncouple the subcellular localization signal from the catalytic activity. Therefore, the GFP-R1L1-R3and GFP-R3L1-R1 constructs allow us to specifically define therole of subcellular localization in promoting Spi secretion fromaxonal termini. ER Localization of Rho-3 Facilitates Spi Secretion Axons Although both Rho-1 and Rho-3 promote Spi secretion from photoreceptor cell bodies, only Rho-3 facilitates Spi secretion from axons. To investigate whether this is due to its ER localization, we assayed the ability of GFP-Rho-1 or GFP-Rho-3 to rescue the rho- 3lamina phenotype. In addition, we tested a modified Rho-1 targeted to the ER and late compartment (GFP-R3L1-R1) and anER-excluded Rho-3 (GFP-R1L1-R3) using the same assay. All constructs were shown to be efficient in cleaving Spi in cell cultureassays and in vivo (unpublished data). Furthermore, since Rho-1 and Rho-3 are normally expressed at low levels in the eye disc, we inserted all the transgenes into attP18, a genomic landing site that was reported to yield low expression levels [39], and expression was driven in R2, R5, and R8 by MT14-Gal4. As expected from their in activities, GFP-Rho-3 rescued therho-3 mutant lamina phenotype, whereas GFP-Rho-1 did not (Figure 3). Importantly, while GFP-Rho-1 failed to promote Spi secretion from the axons, supplementing it with an ER localization yielded a construct (GFP-R3L1-R1) capable of rescuing the rho-3 phenotype (Figure 1E Conversely, whereas GFP-Rho-3rescued the rho-3 phenotype, a Rho-3 version which is not ER localized (GFP-R1L1-R3) failed to do so (Figure 1D and 1F).These experiments show that ER localization is a critical featurethat enables Rhomboid proteases to promote Spi secretion from the axons. We next asked whether intact endogenous Rho-1, which cannot substitute for Rho-3 in Spi processing for axonal release, can facilitate Spi secretion when enriched in the ER. Passage throughthe ER is an essential step in Rho-1 maturation, as a protein bearing transmembrane domains. We thus attempted to compro- mise Rho-1 exit from the ER, by removing one copy of the syntaxin sed5, which is required for the fusion of homozygous mutant subcellular distribution shifted almost completely to the peri-nuclear ER(Figure 3G and 3H). In rho-3 mutants in which sed5gene dosage was halved, we found that some ElaV expression was restored tothe lamina (Figure 3I and 3J). Therefore, when endogenous Rho-1 trafficking out of the ER is compromised, it can substitute for Rho- 3 and promote Spi release from axons. We note here that under strong overexpression conditions, Rho- 1 also rescues the rho-3 phenotype. This may reflect the perdurance of some Rho-1 in the ER when its export machinery is heavily burdened. Indeed, a low endogenous level of ER activity by Rho-1 en route to the apical compartment has been suggested previously [17]. Accordingly, the ER levels of Rho-1-HA in sed5 heterozygotes were too low to be detected yetrestored some laminar ElaV expression to rho-3 mutants. In summary, our results indicate that the difference in subcellularlocalization is the cause of the distinct ability of Rho-3, but not Rho-1, to promote Spi processing and secretion from photore- ceptor axons. Spi Processing for Axonal Signaling Does Not Take Place in the ER The combined ER and secretory compartment localization of Rho-3 is critical for its ability to promote Spi secretion from axons. We next asked whether the ER component of this localization is sufficient for Rho-3 function in lamina induction. We uncoupled the two localizations by tagging Rho-3 with a KDEL sequence at its luminal C-terminus, thereby retaining it in the ER. This construct, as well as a KDEL-tagged Rho-1, were fused at their N- termini to GFP, and inserted into the same genomic landing site asthe constructs previously described. Although GFP-Rho-3-KDEL and GFP-Rho-1-KDEL localize to the ER, and efficiently cleave Spi in cell culture assays and in vivo (unpublished data), they could not rescue the rho-3 lamina phenotype upon expression in the eye by MT14-Gal4 (Figure 4A-4D). This indicates that the ERlocalization of Rho-3 is not sufficient to promote EGFR signaling in the lamina, and suggests that the active Spi molecules secreted from the axons are not processed in the ER. Since Spi that is secreted by photoreceptor axons is not cleaved in the ER, we monitored the capacity to traffic the Spi precursor toPolarized Secretion of EGF Receptor Ligand PLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 5 October 2010 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e1000505Figure 2.

GMR-Gal4-driven expression in a wild-type eye disc of the Spi precursor marked with GFP at the N terminus, gave rise to translocation of the GFP tag across the entire length of theaxon bundle (Figure 4E and 4H). However, it is not possible to determine by this assay whether the ligand that reaches the axon termini represents the precursor form or the cleaved ligand. Two lines of evidence suggest that the ligand precursor can be traffickedfrom the cell body to the axon terminus. First, a non-cleavableform of Spi also reached the axonal growth cones, when expressed in the eye disc (Figure 4F and 4H). Second, expression of mSpi-GFP in a rho-3 mutant background, in which the precursor does not undergo cleavage in the ER, gave rise to a ligand distributionin axons that was similar to wild-type (Figure 4G and 4H). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the Spi precursor Figure 3. ER localization of Rho-3 facilitates Spi secretion from axons.

To support this conclusion, we assayed the ability of a cleaved form of the ligand (cSpi), which is localized to the ER [17], torescue the rho-3 phenotype upon expression R5, and R8. Biologically active cSpi, tagged with HA or HRP,failed to induce ElaV expression in rho-3 laminae (Figure S3). This is consistent with the notion that cleavage of Spi in the ER is notthe mode by which Rho-3 promotes secretion, and suggests thatthe importance of the ER to Rho-3 function stems from a different mechanism.The ER Facilitates Rho-3 Trafficking to Axons The above experiments demonstrate that while ER localization is crucial for the ability of Rho-3 to promote axonal secretion of Spi, the functional ligand is not cleaved in the ER. We therefore examined whether the ER could promote Rho-3-dependent signaling by facilitating the trafficking of the ligand-processingmachinery to axons. Examination of the endogenous ER markers protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and BiP reveals that the ER extends throughout the axons of developing photoreceptor neurons (Figure 5A and unpublished data), as does the detection of KDEL-tagged ER Figure 4.

ER markers were also observed in axons of adult flies (unpublished data), consistent with previous reports indicating that the ER is continuous in the axons of various neurons [26,42]. We also detected the presence of endogenous ER exit sites (marked by dSec16 [43]) along the axons and at their termini in the lamina (Figure 5C), suggesting that proteins are released from the ER in these locations. Consistently, Golgi outposts (marked by Mannosidase II (ManII)-GFP [44]) were also evident along the entire axon length (Figure 5F). Theseobservations suggest that in photoreceptor axons, the ER can be used by secreted proteins to reach a given exit site, prior to progressing along the secretory pathway. To further test this idea, we expressed an ER-localized GFP (GFP-KDEL) [45] in the throughout the axons, while GFPmRNA was confined to the cell bodies (Figure 5D and 5E). Thus, proteins localized to theER in the cell body can also reach the axon, by utilizing the extension of the ER to the axon. Since Rho-3 is ER localized in the cell body, it could use this compartment in a manner similar to GFP-KDEL to move distally.Indeed, whereas rho-3 mRNA is not detected in the axons (Figure 5G), gRho-3-GFP is found in a continuous distribution inaxons (Figure 5H). Conversely, gRho-1-YFP, which is not localized to the peri-nuclear ER, fails to reach the optic stalk (Figure 5I). To examine the possibility that ER localization would promote the axonal delivery of a Rhomboid protease, we generated another gRho-1-YFP construct, with a C-terminal KDEL tag. In contrast to gRho-1-YFP, gRho-1-YFP-KDEL was robustly distributed along the entire length of the axons (Figure 5J). Taken together, these results imply that the importance of the ER for Spi signaling in this physiological context stems from itsability to promote trafficking to the axons, where Spi processing subsequently occurs. Co-Trafficking of Spi, S, and Rho-3 Sensitizes EGFR Signaling in the Lamina to S Levels Besides Rho-3, Spi and S are also localized to the ER in the eye disc. Therefore, the three components could associate in this compartment for joint trafficking to the axons. To test this hypothesis, we examined the co-localization of biologically active, HA-tagged versions of Spi or S with Rho-3-GFP. S-HA co- localizes with Spi-GFP in the axons at the optic stalk (Figure 6B). In photoreceptor cell bodies S was shown to stabilize Spi [46].We observed that S stabilizes Spi in axons, and promotes its trafficking through the axons, as more Spi-GFP molecules arrive at the lamina when with S-HA 6D-6F). S-HA the Both ligand and chaperone thus appear to co-localize with Rho-3-GFP in axons traveling through the optic stalk (Figure 6A and 6C). We have previously shown that S is a substrate for ER- localized Rhomboid proteases [23], and that cleaved S cannottraffic Spi [20]. ER-based cleavage of S has a functional significance, as it limits the trafficking of the Spi precursor by the S chaperone out of the ER. This results in an increased sensitivity of EGFR signaling to S levels. Indeed, Sheterozygous flies exhibit reduced EGFR signaling during oogenesis and eyedevelopment, where the ER-active Rho-2 and Rho-3 mediate Spi processing, respectively [23]. Thus, a sensitivity to Slevels is indicative of exposure to Rhomboid-based cleavage in the ER. We find that Sheterozygous flies show a severe reduction in ElaV expression in the lamina (Figure 6G and 6H). Importantly, thedefect in EGFR signaling in the laminae of these flies is significantly more severe than the compromised induction of photoreceptors in the eye disc. This may reflect a longer exposureof S to ER cleavage by Rho-3 during trafficking to the axon termini. Thus, the hypersensitivity of the lamina to Sgene dosage supports the notion that S and Rho-3 are jointly trafficked through the ER in photoreceptor axons. Endosomal Trafficking Regulates Spi Secretion Following its trafficking to the axonal termini, Spi seems to be secreted locally at a precise location [6]. In the eye disc, Spi is alsosecreted locally, from a late secretory compartment where Rho-1 and Rho-3 reside [23]. To gain insight into the mechanism of Spi release, we set out to identify the ''late compartment'' in the eyedisc. A variety of compartment markers were tested for co-localization with Rho-1-HA expressed in the eye disc (see also[23]), including a collection of YFP-tagged Rab proteins [47]. The only significant co-localization was observed with YFP-Rab4 and YFP-Rab14 (Figure 7A and 7B). This co-localization was alsoverified in cell culture, where a significant proportion of Rho-1-,Rab4-, and Rab14-positive puncta overlap (Figure S4A). but not nuclear, Rho-3-HA staining in the eye disc (Figure S5). Interruption of Rab4 and Rab14 function in photoreceptors by RNA interference (RNAi) or dominant negative (DN) approaches did not result in any discernible phenotypes. However, both Rab proteins interact with effectors of Rab11 [48,49], suggesting a role for this major conserved regulator of endosomal trafficking inSpi exocytosis. Indeed, expression of a DN form of Rab11 inDrosophila cell culture disrupted the by Rho-1-red fluorescent protein (RFP) when the latter was co-expressed with S (Figure S4).Furthermore, in the eye imaginal disc, Rho-1-GFP, which isnormally localized to discrete puncta, of by GMR-Gal4 and Thus, Rab11 does not co-localize to the Rho-1- containing endosomes, its function is essential for their correctformation. We then asked whether EGFR signaling is affected by impairment of the Rab4/14 compartment. Indeed, expression ofRab11DN by GMR-Gal4 led to a reduction in the number ofElaV-expressing cells in the eye disc (unpublished data), as didexpression of a Rab11 RNAi construct (Figure 7E). Importantly,there was no alteration of photoreceptor R8 differentiation, which is not dependent upon EGFR signaling. Since this phenotype may reflect a requirement for Rab11 in the signal-receiving cells,downstream to EGFR, we expressed the Rab11DN constructspecifically in R8, which is the only photoreceptor that actsexclusively as a signal-emitting cell. Again, EGFR phenotypes such as missing photoreceptors and ommatidia were readily apparent (Figures 7F, S6B). This indicates that Rab11acts non-autonomously in where it is required for EGFRligand secretion. When larvae expressing UAS-Rab11DN by GMR-Gal4 in the eye disc were allowed to develop, the resulting adults had verysmall and rough eyes, as previously reported (Figure 7G; see also[47]). Although Rab11 has pleiotropic functions, this phenotype is at least partly due to a specific failure in EGFR ligand secretion, since (Figure 7H). We conclude that in disc, Spi is cleaved and secreted from Rab4/14 endosomes,and that the normal function of these endosomes is required for EGFR ligand trafficking and processing. The requirement for Spi cleavage to take place after ligand is trafficked out of the ER in both the cell bodies and axons, raised the possibility that subsequent trafficking steps also share common features. We therefore sought to determine whether Spi secretionPolarized Secretion of EGF Receptor Ligand PLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 9 October 2010 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e1000505Figure 5.

Indeed, we found that Rab4 orRab14, expressed in the eye disc by GMR-Gal4, reached axonalgrowth cones, as did Rab11. Note that GMR-Gal4 does not driveexpression in the lamina ([6] and Figure As in axonal termini (Figure S5), but not along the length of the axons in the optic stalk (unpublished data).Expression of Rab11DN in the eye disc by GMR-Gal4 led to a significant reduction in the number of ElaV-positive cells in thelamina, while Dac expression was normal (Figure 7I). Importantly,expression of Rab11DN in R8, which does not secrete Spi to thelamina, severely impairs EGFR signaling in the eye disc but not inthe lamina (Figure S6). To further separate the axonal function of Rab11 from its requirement in photoreceptor differentiation, we expressed Rab11DN by GMR-Gal4 together with RasV12, which Figure 6.

In the eye disc RasV12 was epistatic to Rab11DN, where all cells were converted to ElaV-expressing neurons, supporting the notion that Rab11 acts upstream to Ras (Figure S7). Expression of RasV12 in the eye induces an enlarged lamina with extra lamina neurons. Co-expression of Rab11DN attenuated the effects of RasV12 on lamina development in seven of 12 specimens, leading to wild-type or even reduced ElaV expression (Figure S7). In other words, we have uncoupled the requirement for Rab11 for secretion of the ligand in the eye disc and in the lamina by using RasV12 to bypass the requirement for the ligand in the eye disc. Therefore, this effect specifically represents the requirement for Rab11 to allow secretion of the ligand at the axon termini. This is consistent with the notion that after trafficking of mSpi, S, and Rho-3 to the axonal termini, secretion occurs in a similar manner to the eye disc, utilizing a Rab11-dependent mechanism. Discussion Axonal Release of Spi Requires the ER Residence of Rho-3 Polarized secretion of ligands from a signal-emitting cell to the appropriate receptive field is crucial for correct intercellular communication. Control over EGFR ligand secretion, and consequently EGFR activation, in Drosophila is achieved through trafficking and compartmentalization of the ligand-processingmachinery. This work identifies a link between the subcellular localization of the Spi-processing machinery and the polarized release of Spi from axons. Subcellular localization of Rhomboid proteases, which apical Rab4/14 endosomes, where they are redundant in promoting Spi release from cell bodies. In contrast, only the Rho-3 protease mediates axonal secretion of Spi. This is evident from the rho-3 mutant phenotype, which shows a complete loss of EGFR activation in the lamina.Since the two proteases are expressed in the neurons which secrete Spi, and share the same substrate specificity, these features cannot account for the specific requirement for rho-3. RNA transport and localized translation of Rho-3 are also inconsistent with thefollowing observations: (a) no rho-3 RNA was detected in axons, (b) gRho-3-GFP, reflecting endogenous expression, is localizedthroughout the axon, rather than concentrated at a point of localized translation, and (c) Rho-3 cDNA, devoid of 3 9or 59 UTRs, rescued the mutant phenotype. The RNA of the rescuingconstruct was also not localized to axons. Our results indicate that the exclusive requirement for Rho-3 is due to its ER localization. Re-localization of some of the Rho-1pool to the ER, or removal of Rho-3 from the ER, achieved byswapping specific sequences, alternated their potencies to promote axonal secretion of Spi. Furthermore, when the ER export of endogenous Rho-1 was compromised, EGFR activation waspartially restored to the lamina of rho-3 mutants. Thus, the ER localization of Rho-3 in photoreceptor neurons serves a dual function: it negatively regulates Spi secretion from cell bodies, via premature cleavage of S [23], and positively promotes Spisecretion from the axons to the lamina, by facilitating trafficking of the ligand-processing machinery to axon temini (schematized in Figure 7J). The ER Promotes Trafficking of the Spi-Processing Machinery to Axons How does the ER localization of Rho-3 contribute to Spi secretion from axons? The inability of GFP-Rho-3-KDEL or cSpi-HA to rescue the rho-3 phenotype demonstrates that the axonally secreted Spi is not cleaved in the ER, and prompted investigation into the role of the ER in promoting axonal trafficking. We have shown that in Drosophila photoreceptor neurons, the ER extends throughout the axons. ER exit sites and Golgi outpost markers were also detected in axons. The continuity of the ER was previously demonstrated in Purkinje neurons [26] and in other cell types, including Drosophila oocytes [42,51]. This implies that ER- localized proteins could use this compartment to move distally in the axon. Indeed, GFP-KDEL expressed in the eye disc reaches the axonal termini. Furthermore, the ER-localized Rho-3 isenriched in axons, as opposed to Rho-1, which is restricted to endosomes. Importantly, restricting the gRho-1 construct to the ER with a KDEL sequence gave rise to a robust translocation of the protease throughout axons, reaching their growth cones in the lamina. ER-facilitated trafficking of Rho-3 could occur through diffusion in the ER membrane, with exit and retrieval of ER-derived vesicles being biased distally. Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, the ER presence of Rho-3 could lead it to an exit site localized at the axon base, from which trafficking would bedirected towards the growth cones. This would explain the ability of Rho-1 to rescue the rho-3 phenotype under strong overexpres- sion conditions. Distinction between these possibilities wouldrequire co-localization of Rho-3 or Spi immunoreactivity with known compartment markers in axons. So far, and despite a largenumber of markers examined, we could not detect such co- localization (unpublished data). Since the extension of the ER is correlated with the growth of the axons [52,53], ER-facilitated trafficking also provides a means of ensuring that ligand is released only once the axons have reached their target layer, and ER exitsites and Golgi membranes are set in place. Spi, S, and Rho-3 are all localized to the peri-nuclear ER in the eye disc. Since all three proteins can interact with one another [19,46], this implies that the processing machinery could assemble in the ER for joint trafficking. Indeed, we found that Spi, S, andRho-3 also co-localize in photoreceptor axons. Further evidenceFigure 7. Regulation of Spi secretion by endosomal trafficking.

(F) R8-specific expression of Rab11DN by Sca-Gal4 disrupts EGFR signaling in adjacent cells, indicating that Rab11 is involved in ligand secretion. For example, two ommatidia with only four outer photoreceptors (*) and an R8 cell ( #) are marked. (G) Adult flies expressing Rab11DN by GMR-Gal4 have small eyes. (H) Co-expression of Rho-1 or Rho-3 (not shown) rescues the defects associated with Rab11DN, suggesting that these defects are partly due to a failure to properly target Rhomboids and secrete Spi. (I) Expression of Rab11DN in the eye also leads to a defect in EGFR signaling in the lamina. ElaV staining in the lamina (red, and in [I0 ]) is strongly reduced (arrowhead in [I0] shows residual staining), while Dac expression (green, and in [I 9]) is not affected. (J) Model.

We have previouslyshown that S cleavage in the ER leads to compromised EGFR activation phenotypes upon halving Sgene dosage [23]. The observation that EGFR signaling in the lamina is even more sensitive to Sgene dosage than in the eye suggests that Rho-3 and S spend a significant time in the ER, where the chaperone isexposed to inactivation by cleavage. How targeting of Spi-S-Rho-3 complexes to the basally located axons or the apical Rab4/14 endosomes is achieved is unclear. In the case of Hh, the presence or absence of the C-terminal cleavage fragment in the Hh-containing vesicle determines its destination[4]. The Spi C-terminus is not required for axonal targeting, sincea Spi-GFP construct lacking most of the C-terminus showed thesame distribution as intact Spi-GFP upon expression in the eye(unpublished data). Alternatively, another factor, which would beER localized, could promote the trafficking of the processingmachinery to axons. This factor is also expected to be expressedmainly in R2, R5, and R8, accounting for their importance in Spisecretion to the lamina. In the Drosophila oocyte, the polarized ER exit of another EGFR ligand, Gurken, is regulated by Cornichon.Somatic functions for Cornichon and its homolog Cornichon related have also been identified but not thoroughly explored yet [54]. While the presence of ER markers in axons or dendrites has been previously reported [27], the biological significance of suchobservations, commonly derived from protein localization data incultured neurons, could only be speculated upon, since nofunctional readout was examined. The unique properties of photoreceptor axons in Drosophila , which not only conduct electrical signals but are also involved in transmitting develop- mental cues at an earlier phase, have allowed us to functionallydemonstrate the essential role of the ER in trafficking the completeEGFR ligand-processing apparatus to axon termini. Thismechanism is clearly distinct from the established roles of theaxonal ER in allowing local translation of secreted or transmem-brane proteins whose mRNAs are enriched at axon termini. Endosomal Regulation of Spi Secretion Spi is released to the extracellular milieu following cleavage by Rho-1. Different experimental systems have yielded conflictingreports as to the compartment in which the protease resides [18-20,55]. We now find that in both photoreceptor neurons andSchneider cells, Rho-1 is localized to an endosomal population marked by Rab4 and Rab14. Rab4 localizes to fast recycling endosomes, which mediate the endocytosed cargo tothe Rab11 a majorregulator of vesicle transport. The role of endosomal dynamics in Spi secretion is manifested by the EGFR phenotypes obtained following expression of Rab11RNAi or DN constructs. While Rab11 has pleiotropic EGFR signaling, perturbing Rab11directly impinges on Spi secretion. from themislocalization of Rho-1-GFP in Rab11DN-expressing photore-ceptors, and from similar effects in cell culture. This mislocaliza-tion is likely the cause of the phenotype, since co-expression ofRho-1 or Rho-3 with Althoughinterfering with endosomal dynamics may also perturb signalingdownstream of the receptor, we did not observe a mislocalizationof EGFR itself (unpublished data). Furthermore, the expression of Rab11DN in R8 impaired the differentiation of nearby cells intophotoreceptor neurons, demonstrating that Rab11 acts non- autonomously upstream of the receptor, consistent with a role in ligand secretion. Rho-1 and some of the Rho-3 pool are localized to Rab4/14 endosomes. The intracellular route by which they reach these compartments remains to be explored. From the ER accumulation of Rho-1-HA in sed5mutant clones, we infer that the proteases do not undertake a Golgi-independent route to the Rab4/14endosomes and Rab11 endosomes can be reached without passing through the plasma membrane (see for example [60-62]). Therefore, there is no indication that Rhomboids must pass through the plasma membrane to reach the endosomal compartment. Nevertheless, if Spi is secreted by fusion of Rhomboid-containing endosomes with the membrane, then retrieval by endocytosis should play a role in shaping the steady-state distribution of Rhomboids. Accordingly, we have found that upon expression of a DN form of the Dynamin Shibire, Rho-1-HA immunofluorescence is detected on the plasma membrane (unpublished data). Trafficking of Spi to endosomes also provides an efficient means of disposing of the ligand in cells that do not express a Rhomboidprotease, to prevent nonspecific cleavage on the plasma mem- brane. In this case, the membrane-bound precursor could be sorted to a membrane domain that segregates to multi-vesicular bodies, and then degraded in the lysosome. Accordingly, distinct membrane domains have been described for Rab4 and Rab11 endosomes [63]. Finally, we Rab4/14 and Rho-3 at axonal termini, but not in the optic stalk, and found that disrupting Rab11 function in the eye disc compromised EGFR signaling in the lamina. This effect was not due to defects in eye development, as Rab11DN expressed in R8 also impaired eyedevelopment but had no effect on the lamina. This finding raises the possibility that the final steps of secretion from axonal termini and cell bodies are regulated in a similar manner, although Rab11 seems to play a more prominent role in secretion from cell bodies. A precedent supporting such a hypothesis is the requirement for Sec15, which interacts with Rab11, for the localization of several molecules at both photoreceptor cell bodies and axonal termini [64]. In summary, our results describe a mechanism of ER-facilitated trafficking of secreted molecules in axons, prior to processing and secretion at the axon tip. This mechanism could also be utilized for other proteins that are secreted in a polarized manner in neurons.

Haueter3, Karen L. Schulze3 and Hugo J. Bellen1,2,3,4,8 Cell fate decisions mediated by the Notch signalling pathway require direct cell-cell contact between adjacent cells. In Drosophila melanogaster, an external sensory organ (ESO) develops from a single sensory organ precursor (SOP) and its fate specification is governed by differential Notch activation. Here we show that mutations in actin-related protein-3 (Arp3) compromise Notch signalling, leading to a fate transformation of the ESO. Our data reveal that during ESO fate specification, most endocytosed vesicles containing the ligand Delta traffic to a prominent apical actin-rich structure (ARS) formed in the SOP daughter cells. Using immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses, we show that the ARS contains numerous microvilli on the apical surface of SOP progeny. In Arp2/3 and WASp mutants, the surface area of the ARS is substantially reduced and there are significantly fewer microvilli. More importantly, trafficking of Delta-positive vesicles from the basal area to the apical portion of the ARS is severely compromised. Our data indicate that WASp-dependent Arp2/3 actin polymerization is crucial for apical presentation of Delta, providing a mechanistic link between actin polymerization and Notch signalling. Notch signalling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway used by metazoans to control cell fate decisions 1,2. The Notch receptor and its ligands Delta and Serrate (Jagged in vertebrates) are single-pass transmembrane proteins. Cell-cell communication begins when the extracellular domain of the lig-and on the signal-sending cell interacts with the extracellular domain of the Notch receptor on the signal-receiving cell. This interaction triggers a series of proteolytic cleavages that releases the intracellular domain of Notch, which enters the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional regulator 3. Notch signalling mediates key decisions during nervous system develop- ment4, including patterning and fate specification of the ESOs5. Each ESO is composed of four cell types (shaft, socket, sheath and neuron) and is derived from a single cell, the SOP (also called the pI cell), which is selected through Notch-mediated lateral inhibition at about 8-12 h after puparium formation (APF; Fig. 1a). The stage when the SOP has not yet undergone cell divi- sion is referred to as the 1-cell stage (15-18 h APF). During the 2-cell stage (~18-18.30 h APF) the SOP undergoes asymmetric cell division to generate the anterior pIIb and posterior pIIa (Fig. 1a). Because of the asymmetric distribution of cell fate determinants such as Numb and Neuralized 6,7, Notch signalling is differentially activated in pIIa and pIIb. The pIIa divides to cre-ate the external cells of the ESO, the shaft and socket cells. The pIIb divides twice to create the internal cells of the ESO, the neuron and sheath cell 8. These four differentiated cells are collectively called the sensory cluster.Delta and Serrate act redundantly to activate Notch during specifica- tion of pIIa and pIIb9. Recent studies indicate that endocytosis of Delta in the signal-sending cell is crucial for its ability to activate Notch10. An alternative, but not mutually exclusive model, is that ligand endocytosis promotes trafficking of the ligand to an endocytic recycling compart-ment, resulting in its activation 11,12. In addition, apical trafficking of Delta seems to be important for proper fate specification in the SOP lineage13. However, the nature of ligand activation or the requirement for apical trafficking of the ligand remains unclear. Here, we report that there is an apical actin-enriched structure in the pIIa and pIIb cells that contains numerous microvilli. The surface area of the actin-rich region and the number of microvilli are markedly reduced in Arp2/3 complex and WASp mutants. More importantly, we found that the Arp2/3 complex and W ASp have crucial roles in trafficking of endocytosed Delta vesicles to an apical ARS. RESULTS Mutations in Arp3 result in a pIIa-to-pIIb cell fate transformation in Drosophila ESO lineages Notch loss-of-function results in a pIIa-to-pIIb transformation, leading to loss of bristles 14.

We performed a similar F1 mitotic recombination screen on chromosome arm 3L16 and isolated one complementation group consisting of three homozygous lethal alle- les (83F, 515FC and 1066PC) that cause loss clones 1b, b\u00b4). Using a recombination-based mapping strategy17, the lethality of these alleles was mapped to the 66B cytological region (Fig. 1c). We obtained a P element EP(3)3640 (ref. 18) inserted upstream of the Arp3 gene that failed to complement our alleles, and identified molecular lesions in Arp3 for the three alleles (Fig. 1c). Overexpression of the Arp3 cDNA the lethality and ESO phenotype (Fig. 1d), demonstrating that the observed phenotypes are caused by loss of Arp3. Arp3 is part of the seven-protein Arp2/3 complex, which functions together for polymerization of branched actin filaments 19. Another com - ponent of the Arp2/3 complex, Arpc1, was shown to be involved in ring canal formation during oogenesis in Drosophila 18. As with Arp3 alleles, Arpc1Q25st clones cause bristle loss (Fig. 1e)20. Bristle loss in Arp3 clones does not result from a failure to specify SOPs (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1a, a\u00b4).

ARTICLES at 24 h APF were labelled with differentiation markers. In wild-type sensory clusters, all four cells expressed the homeodomain protein Cut and one expressed the neuronal marker ELAV (Fig. 1f). In contrast, sensory clusters in both Arp3 and Arpc1Q25st mutant clones contained 4-6 ELAV-positive cells (Fig. 1g and data not shown), suggesting that there is a pIIa-to-pIIb fate transformation. Although a pIIa-to-pIIb transformation might result from disruption of asymmetric localization of cell fate determinants6,7, both Neuralized and Numb were asymmetrically localized in Arp3 mutant SOPs (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1c, e). One of the activators of the Arp2/3 complex, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (W ASp)21, is also involved in a similar fate specification process in Drosophila22. Together these observations suggest a specific requirement for W ASp-regulated Arp2/3-complex function in Notch signalling. Arp3 functions in the signal-sending cell during Notch signalling Is Arp2/3 function required in the signal-sending or the signal-receiving cell during Notch signalling? We first determined the epistatic relation-ship between Notch and Arp3 with a constitutively active Notch that is independent of ligand activation (N ECN)23. Expression of NECN in the ESO lineage causes a Notch gain-of-function phenotype, which results in generation of extra socket cells13. Overexpression of NECN in Arp3 clones, as in wild-type cells, resulted in a Notch gain-of-function phenotype, indicating that a ligand-independent form of Notch is epistatic to Arp3 (Fig. 2a). This places the function of Arp3 upstream of Notch activation, possibly in the signal-sending cell. To gather evidence for a requirement of Arp3 in the signal-sending cell, we examined its function in oogenesis. Egg chambers are individual units, consisting of germline cells surrounded by somatic follicle cells. The follicle cells can be further divided into three distinct populations: main body follicle cells (phalloidin-positive cells, Fig. 2b), which encap- sulate the germline cyst; polar cells, which function as signalling centres (FasIII-positive cells, Fig. 2b); and stalk cells that connect neighbour - ing cysts (yellow arrow, Fig. 2b). The role of Notch signalling is well- documented in oogenesis 24,25, and signal-sending and receiving cells are spatially well-segregated. Notch loss-of-function causes the inability of the follicle cells to encapsulate germline cysts and leads to the formation of giant compound egg chambers 25. However, Delta loss-of-function in follicle cells does not result in an encapsulation defect25 but rather, loss of stalk cells and partial fusion of the cysts. Delta is required in the anterior polar follicle cells of the posterior egg chamber to specify stalk cells 25,26. Generating follicle cell clones of Notch and Delta , therefore, results in Merge GFP=WT da Figure 2 Arp3 is required in the signal sending cells during Notch signalling (a) Overexpression of NECN in wild-type SOPs using the sca109-68-GAL4 driver results in a multiple socket phenotype in the majority of the sensory clusters. We generated Arp3 clones (dashed line) using Ubx-FLP in this NECN overexpression background. We did not observe a region of bald cuticle in the Arp3 clones. (b ) Clones of Arp3515FC induced by hs-FLP in follicle cells are marked by the absence of GFP (green). FasciclinIII (red) marks the follicle cells and is upregulated in polar follicle cells. Phalloidin (blue) marks the membrane of all cells. When polar follicle cells are wild-type (WT), stalk cells (yellow arrow) are formed normally, separating two cysts, whereas, when the polar follicle cells are mutant for Arp3, we found a loss of stalk cells between the cysts, resulting in a partial fusion of cysts (white arrow). (c -c\u00b4\u00b4) The follicle cells of the cyst harbour mutant clones of Arp3 induced by hs- FLP at stage 7 of oogenesis. Arp3 mutant clones are marked by the absence of nuclear GFP (green).

We found that loss of Arp3 phenocopied loss-of- function of Delta . Mutant clones of Arp3 (n = 14) in anterior polar fol- licle cells resulted in loss of stalk cells and partial fusion of adjacent cysts (white arrow, Fig. 2b). At later stages of oogenesis, Delta signals from the germ cells (signal-sending cells) activate Notch in the overlying somatic follicle cells (signal-receiving cells), resulting in expression of a Notch downstream target, Hindsight (Hnt) 27. Arp3 does not seem to be required in the signal-receiving cell for Notch function, as expression of Hnt was normal in Arp3 mutant follicle cell clones (Fig. 2c, c\u00b4). To further examine whether Arp2/3 function is required in the signal- sending cell during wing formation, a Delta overexpression assay was performed. During wing development, pre-patterning signals, including Notch, are required to compartmentalize the immature wing imaginal disc at the third-instar larva 28. Notch signalling is required to activate Cut expression at the dorsal-ventral boundary29,30. Previous studies have shown that overexpression of Delta in wild-type clones near the dorsal-ventral boundary results in ectopic Cut expression in the neighbour - ing cells (Fig. 2d) 11,16,29,30. However, similar overexpression of Delta in Arpc1 clones failed to activate Cut expression and resulted in loss of endogenous Cut expression when the clone crossed the dorsal-ventral boundary (Fig. 2e). These data suggest that Arp2/3 complex function is required for the normal function of Delta in the signal-sending cell. The Arp2/3 complex is not required for Delta endocytosis Delta must be endocytosed in the signal-sending cell to activate Notch on the receiving cell 6,31. As Arp2/3 and W ASp have been shown to be required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast32,33, Arp2/3 might be required for Delta endocytosis during fate specification. However, by performing a Delta endocytosis assay 6 at the 2 -cell stage, we found that Delta is endocytosed similarly to wild-type cells (Fig. 3a) in Arpc1 and Arp3 mutant tissue (Fig. 3c, d). By contrast, in shibire (Dynamin ) mutant cells kept at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 3b), Delta is not endocytosed34,35. This indicates that the Arp2/3 complex is not required for ligand endocytosis during Notch signalling. A specific ARS forms during fate specification in the ESO lineage As Arp2/3 is required for In the wild-type, a prominent apical ARS was present in the pIIa pIIb the apical-most stalk region of the pIIb cell that is engulfed by the pIIa cell 36, indicates that the ARS is present in both pIIa-pIIb cells apically (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1f, f\u00b4). However, no specialized apical actin enrichment was observed at the earlier 1-cell stage (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1g, g\u00b4). In Arpc1 (yellow arrows, Fig. 4a, a\u00b4\u00b4), Arp3 and WASp (data not shown) pIIa-pIIb cells, the ARS was formed. However, the apical area of the ARS was markedly reduced in Arp3 (9.57 \u00b1 5.32 m 7.74 m2; n = 19) pIIa-pIIb with the wild-type (43.48 \u00b1 13.79 m2; Fig. 4b; n = 18). The ARS in wild-type pIIa-pIIb cells formed an umbrella shape along the xy axis, whereas in about 50% of the mutant ARS, the stalk of the umbrella was not formed properly (Fig. 4a\u00b4\u00b4, d). To test whether the ARS is affected in other mutants, Adaptin15 and numb7, which regulate Notch signalling during pIIa-pIIb specifica- tion, were examined. In mutant clones of Adaptin (Fig. 4e) and numb (Fig. 4f) the ARS was formed normally, suggesting that the ARS defect is specific to Arpc1 , Arp3 and WASp . In neuralized clones, where both lateral inhibition and fate specification37 are affected, the ARS was clearly observed in all SOP progeny (Fig. 4 g, g\u00b4\u00b4). This suggests that most, if not all, SOP progeny at the 2-cell stage are instructed to form an ARS. To examine whether the Arp2/3 complex colocalizes with the ARS, we (UAS-Arp3- GFP) much of the GFP-tagged Arp3 protein colocalized with the ARS (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1h, h\u00b4\u00b4). The presence of the ARS in the pIIa-pIIb cells during fate specification and the fact that the ARS is morphologically affected in the Arp3, Arpc1 and WASp mutants indicate that it has a role in Notch signal transduction. Abundant actin-rich microvilli are present at the apical surface of pIIa-pIIbThe ARS was further analysed using TEM to visualize the actin cytoskeleton at the ultracellular level 38. To distinguish the pIIa-pIIb cell- membrane from that of epithelial cells, HRP was overexpressed in the pIIa-pIIb cells using On DAB staining, HRP labelling was visualized as a darker cell membrane outline in the SOPs. The serial apical cross-sections (0-2520 nm) of the pIIa-pIIb cells revealed numerous membrane protrusions (Fig. 5b; Supplementary Information, Fig. S2). At high magnification (\u00d710,000), we clearly observed actin bundles within these membranous extensions (Fig. 5c), which was confirmed by immuno-electron microscopy phalloidin (Fig. Sens Arpc1 cd Arp3 and Arpc1 mutant pIIa-pIIb.

ARTICLES revealed fewer finger-like projections than in wild-type cells (Fig. 5g), consistent with the marked reduction in apical surface area of the ARS in Arp3 , Arpc1 and WASp mutants (Fig. 4b). Finger-like projections were present on the epithelial cells, but there were fewer and they were markedly shorter (only about 60 nm in length), compared with those of pIIa-pIIb (Supplementary Information, Fig. S3a, c). The finger-like actin projections on the pIIa-pIIb cells resemble micro- villi, which are typically observed to be densely packed in intestinal and kidney epithelial cells 39, and circulating leukocytes40. Microvilli on the intestinal and kidney epithelial cells are thought to increase the surface area for absorption, whereas in leukocytes they have been implicated in receptor presentation, which enables leukocyte adhesion 41,42. To examine whether the finger-like projections are microvilli, the ARS was immu-nostained with a microvilli marker myosin 1B (Myo1B), which forms lateral tethers between the microvillar membrane and underlying actin filament core 43. We found that Myo1B is indeed enriched in the api- cal region of pIIa-pIIb cells (Fig. 6b, b\u00b4), specifically at the base of the 'umbrella' region of the ARS (Fig. 6b\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4). This localization of Myo1B was unaffected in Arp3 mutant pIIa-pIIb cells (Supplementary Information, Fig. S3e, e\u00b4). These data indicate that microvilli are present on the apical region of pIIa-pIIb cells. Delta traffics to the ARS Intracellular vesicular trafficking of Delta is emerging as a key regula-tory step in the activation of Notch 44,45. We investigated Delta trafficking by co-staining of phalloidin and Delta. In wild-type pIIa-pIIb cells, Delta vesicles colocalized with the apical microvillar region of the ARS (Fig. 7a and transverse section in 7a\u00b4). In Arpc1 (Fig. 7b and transverse section in Fig. 7b\u00b4) and Arp3 (data not shown) pIIa-pIIb, fewer Delta vesicles were colocalized with the ARS. Furthermore, when serial sec-tions were projected to visualize the whole cell (Fig. 7c, c\u00b4\u00b4), the Delta vesicles were clustered close to the wild-type ARS, whereas the vesicles were widely distributed in the cytoplasm of Arpc1 pIIa-pIIb cells. The marked reduction of Delta vesicles colocalizing with the ARS in the mutant pIIa-pIIb cells suggests that Arp2/3 has a role in Delta traffick-ing to the ARS. ************p<0.0001 18 19 22 19b Figure 4 The ARS forms specifically in the pIIa-pIIb progeny and is reduced in Arp3, Arpc1 and WASp mutant SOP progeny.

ARTICLES Arp2/3 and WASp are required for trafficking of endocytosed Delta to the apical ARS To investigate Delta trafficking in Arp2/3 and WASp mutants, we performed pulse-chase labelling experiments12 to monitor the inter - nalization of Delta in living pupae. Internalization of Delta vesicles with respect to ARS was examined at three different time-points (0, 30 and 60 min). At 0 min Delta vesicles were present apically (~0.5 m into the sample) and colocalized with b\u00b4\u00b4), Arpc1 and (data shown) SOP progeny. At 30 min post-internalization, Delta vesicles were localized basally (~6 m) and Arp3 (Fig. 8d, d\u00b4\u00b4) SOP eny, indicating that the Delta vesicles had trafficked intracellularly at this time-point. However, 60 min after internalization, localiza-tion of Delta vesicles in mutants differed Delta traffics S4b, b\u00b4\u00b4) mutants, Delta vesicles were not localized apically on the ARS.

Indeed, the number of Delta vesicles that traffic to the microvillar region of the ARS at 60 min post-chase was significantly lower in the Arpc1 , Arp3 and WASp pIIa-pIIb than in the total number of internal- ized Delta vesicles and the intensity of Delta signal in the SOP prog-eny at 60 min post-chase were very similar in wild-type and mutants (Supplementary Information, Fig. S4c, d).

ARTICLES min after internalization. However, endocytosed Delta is not targeted back to the microvillar region in Arp3 , Arpc1 and WASp SOP progeny 60 min post-chase. It has been proposed that Delta must be endocytosed and targeted to a specific endosomal compartment to become activated11, possibly through Rab11-positive recycling endosomes12,13. By examining the distribution of the vesicular compartments, we found that the early endosome and the recycling endosome were enriched on the ARS (Supplementary Information, Fig. S4e-h\u00b4). Pulse-chase of endocytosed Delta through these compartments (Supplementary Information, Figs S5, S6), showed no significant defects in the localization and abundance of these endo-somal compartments or the ability of Delta to traffic through these endo-somal compartments in Arpc1 mutant SOP progeny. The internalized Delta is thought to be proteolytically cleaved in an unknown compart-ment 11. We found that Delta processing in Arp3 mutants is similar to that in the wild-type (Supplementary Information, Fig. S7). In summary, we surmise that a defect in trafficking of endocytosed Delta to the apical microvillar portion of the ARS leads to a failure in Delta signalling. We conclude that this defect underlies the pIIa-to-pIIb fate transformation phenotype in Arp3, Arpc1 and WASp mutants. DISCUSSIONPrevious reports have that trafficking of a subset of endocy - tosed Delta to the apical membrane in the pIIb cell is required for its ability to activate Notch in the pIIa cell 12,13. We have uncovered a highly stereotyped ARS that consists of apical microvilli and a lateral 'stalk' region. In Arp2/3 and WASp pIIa-pIIb cells, the apical surface area of the ARS was significantly reduced and the number of microvilli on the apical region was also reduced. In addition, trafficking of endocytosed Delta to the apical microvilli-rich region of the ARS was severely impaired in Arp3 mutants . Although numerous studies have focused on the SOP daughter cells, the ARS and the microvilli have not been described pre-viously. These microvillar structures are very different from filopodia 46, which have been reported to have a role in lateral inhibition47 at an earlier stage. Our data indicate that apical trafficking of Delta to the ARS is required for its ability to signal. Given the role of Arp2/3 in forming branched actin filaments, one of the primary roles of the Arp2/3 complex and W ASp during Notch signal-ling is probably to form actin networks 48, and to enable and/or to promote the trafficking of Delta vesicles to the ARS (Fig. 8h). This requirement for endocytosed Delta localization to the microvilli during Notch signalling is akin to findings showing that localization of Smoothened to primary cilia is important for its activation during Hedgehog (Hh) signal trans-duction 49,50. An interesting study performed in circulating lymphocytes has demonstrated a crucial requirement for microvillar receptor pres-entation in leukocyte adhesion to the endothelial membrane 41. In an analogous manner to findings in leukocytes, microvillar presentation of Delta might enhance its ability to contact Notch on the surface of the adjacent cell. As Notch signalling is a major contact-dependent sig-nalling pathway, microvilli might therefore increase the surface area of contact between the signal-sending and receiving cells, enhancing the ability of the ligand to interact with the receptor. On the basis of the well-characterized role for W ASp and Arp2/3 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis 32, it Basal Figure 6 Finger-like projections in pIIa-pIIb cells are enriched with F-actin bundles and are marked by a microvillar marker Myo1B.

ARTICLES W ASp might be required for endocytosis of Delta and/or Notch during signalling51. However, our data indicate that the Arp2/3 complex is not required for Notch in the signal-receiving cell. Our data also indicate that the Arp2/3 complex is not required to endocytose Delta. It is possible that endocytosis of Delta occurs in a clathrin-independent manner 52,53. The involvement of WASp during Notch-mediated fate decisions might have implications for its mammalian homologue in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, an X-linked immunodeficiency 54. Given that Notch signalling is required for proper T -cell development55 and dif- ferentiation of peripheral T -cells56, defects in Delta trafficking caused by W ASp-mediated actin polymerization might underlie the loss and aberrant function of T cells in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Interestingly, microvilli on the surface of lymphocytes might also have a central role in receptor presentation in macrophages and T cells 41,42. It will be interesting to investigate whether W ASp has a role in Notch signalling during T -cell development and activation.

In the pIIb cell, Delta is endocytosed by Neuralized (Neur) 6 and trafficked by Epsin11 to an endocytic compartment where it undergoes activation, probably by a proteolytic cleavage event. It is trafficked back to the membrane in a compartment positive for Rab11 (ref. 12) and the exocyst complex member Sec15 (ref. 13).

DOI: 10.1038/ncb1888 METHODS METHODS Drosophila genetics. Stocks used in this study were: 1) y y w; sca109-68-GAL4 (ref. 66). Rescue experiments were performed using the MARCM technique. Flies mutant bristles with longer and thicker appearance were differentiated from the short and thin RpS174 (Minute phenotype) bristles. Epistasis analysis of Arp3 with the ligand-independent form of Notch57, NECN was performed by examining flies chambers were generated by heat-shocking virgin females of genotype y w hs FLP/+; FRT80B RpS174 Ubi-GFP FRT80B for 90 min at 38 \u00b0C for 3 consecutive days. Ovaries of heat-shocked females were dissected after 2-3 days of mating on medium supplemented with yeast. The wing-disc signal-sending cell assay was performed as described pre- viously67,68 and flies of the genotype discs from third instar larvae or pupal nota were dissected in PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min. The samples were then permeabilized in PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 20 min and blocked with 5% normal donkey serum in PBST for 1 h. Samples were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C over - night. The following primary antibodies were used: chicken anti-GFP (1:2,000, Abcam), mouse anti-Cut anti-ELAV (1:200; reaction, Invitrogen), The fol - lowing antibodies were used in the experiments included in the Supplementary Information: rabbit anti-Numb (1:1,000; Y . N. Jan) Davis)82, incubated with Cy3- and/ or Cy5-conjugated affinity purified donkey secondary antibodies (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Images were captured using an LSM510 confocal microscope and Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. Images were processed with Amira 5.0.1 and Adobe PhotoShop 7.0. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To identify the pIIa-pIIb cells, we used flies of the following genotype: UAS-CD2::HRP; neur A101GAL4 (ref. 61). In this genotype cell membranes correspond to pIIa-pIIb at the 16-18 h APF time-point, as neur A101GAL4 drives expression of the CD2::HRP in the SOP and its progeny. To identify the SOP progeny in Arp3 mutant clones for TEM analysis, we examined the flies with the genotype activated only in Arp3 mutant SOP progeny. HRP label was visualized by TEM as described previously84 except for the following modifications: the pupal thorax was dissected at 18 h APF. After ampli- fication and visualization of the HRP signal under a dissecting microscope, the tissues were fixed 85 to preserve the actin filament structures. The tissues were then processed for TEM using microwave irradiation with PELCO BioWave equipped with PELCO Cold Spot and Vacuum System. Serial sections (60 nm) were cut and post-stained with Reynold's lead citrate, and examined with a JEOL transmission electron microscope (JEOL 1010). The serial sections were labelled on the basis of their depth from the first electron micrograph that shows the most apical portion of HRP labelled SOP microvilli. To label actin, the pupal thorax was dissected at 18 h APF, fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M PB pH 7.2 for 1.5 h, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton PBS for 5 min, labelled with biotin-XX phal- loidin (3 units; Invitrogen) in PBS for 30-35 min. Samples were then incubated in streptavidin-HRP in TNT buffer (1:100; Sigma). To develop enzyme activity, we used a procedure described previously 84. Delta endocytosis and pulse-chase assay. The endocytosis and pulse-chase assays were modified from previous reports 86,87. Pupae were partially dissected in Schneider's medium at 18 h APF by making an incision along the dorsal side, and the internal tissues were washed out. The 'empty' pupal case was incu-bated with the anti-Delta ECD C594.9B; 15-20 min on ice Schneider's medium supplemented with 25 g ml-1 of 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (Sigma). The tissue was washed three times by medium changes. For the Delta pulse-chase assay the pupal cases were incubated at 25 \u00b0C for different time periods (0, 30 and 60 min) in Schneider's medium supplemented with 5 g ml -1 of 20-hydroxy-ecdysone. the supplemented with 5 g ml -1 of 20-hydroxy-ecdysone at 34 \u00b0C in a water bath to inactivate the shibire gene in the negative control shits1. After (endocytosis assay), the pupal cases were fixed for 20 min with 4% formaldehyde in Schneider's medium supplemented with 5 g ml -1 of 20-hydroxy-ecdysone. The normal immunostaining protocol was then followed. The following antibodies were used in the experiments in the pulse-chase co-labelling experiments in the Supplementary Information: Gait\u00e1n) . Davis)82, guinea pig anti-Hrs-FL (1:600; ref. 83). Statistical analysis. Measurements of total number of Delta vesicles that traffic to the ARS 1 h after chase, and measurements of the total number of Delta vesicles endocytosed were analysed using a Student's t-test (***P <0.0001. Measurements of the ARS area were quantified using the Measure function of the ImageJ soft-ware. The measurements were analysed using a Student's t-test <0.0001). For TEM, measurements of total number of microvilli in SOP and epithelial cells were quantified using ImageJ. The measurements were analysed using a Student's t-test (P <0.05). The measurement of Delta colocalization with Rab5 and Rab11 as well as the determination of Delta, Rab11 and Rab5 signal intensities were quantified using the labelvoxel and materialstatistics functions in Amira 5.0.1. The measurements were analysed using a Student's t-test (*P =0.01). Western blotting. For the Delta western blots, 50 embryos of the appropriate genotypes were collected at 0-13 h AEL and 13-19 hAEL and lysed in ice-cold 1.0% NP -40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0) with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysates were suspended in equal volume of 3\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer in the absence of reducing agents, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Delta was detected on a western blot using anti-Delta C594.9B) was used at 1:10,000 and the blots were developed using Western Lightning chemilu- minescent substrate (PerkinElmer LAS). 57.

Based on our data, the ARS may have a role in these trafficking event s. We therefore examined the co -localization of different endosomal compartments with respect to the ARS during cell fate specif ication. Immunostaining with endosomal and vesicular compartment markers endosome s, EE )4, Rab11 (recycling endosome s, and Spinster ( lysosome s)7, 8 revealed that EE and RE are enriched apically where they co -localize with the microvillar region of the ARS in the pIIa -pIIb at the 2 -cell stage (Supplementary Fig. 4 e, e', h, h'). However, the LE and lysosomes are not enriched with respect to the ARS (Supplementary Fig. 4 g, g', f, f'). We find the localization of these endosomal and vesicular compartments are similar to WT in Arp3, Arpc1 mutant pIIa-pIIb cells (data not shown) . Endosomal trafficking of Delta through the early endosome s (EE) and recycling endosomes (RE) during pIIa-pIIb fate specification: To examine if Delta trafficking through the EE and RE is altered in mutants of the Arp2/3 co mplex, we performed pulse chase assays at 30 mins and 60 mins after \u00a9 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved. 2 internalization (Supplementary Fig. 5, 6). We focus ed on these compartments as they were enriched on the ARS at the 2-cell stage ( Supplementary Fig. 4 e, e', h, h'). With regard to the Rab 5-positive EE compartment we find that there is no statistically significant difference of Delta co -localization with this compartment between WT and mutant at 30 mins post -internalization (Supplementary Fig. 5 a- b'', e). However, a fter 60 mins chase there seems to be a borderline significant increase in Delta vesicle co -localization to the Rab5 compartment (p=0.01, test) Arpc1 mutants compared to WT (Supplementary Fig. 5 c-d'', e). We also assayed if the abundance of th e EE is alter ed in the Arpc1 mutant by quantifying the signal intensity of Rab5 immuno -staining in the Arpc1 mutant pIIa-pIIb min and 60 mins after internalization , and we find that there is no significant difference (Supplementary Fig. 5 f) . Furthermore, w e found that there is not a statistically significant difference of Delta trafficking with respect to the Rab11 -positive RE at both 30 mins and 60 mins post internalization ( Supplementary Fig. 6 a-d'', e). The distribution and abundance of the Rab11 compar tment itself remains largely unaffected in the Arpc1 mutants ( Supplementary Fig. 6 f) . In addition , when the pI cell divides, Emery et al (2005) have reported that Rab11 localizes asymmetrically to the pIIb cell3. We found that this asymmetric distribution of Rab11 to the pIIb compartment is unaffected in dividing pIs of Arp3 mutants (data not shown). Our hypothesis based on these result s is that the primary defect in Arp2/3 mutants is their inability to traffic Delt a to the apical region of the ARS , and we consider this increased co -localization of Delta to the Rab5 compartment as a \u00a9 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The reason we favor this hypot hesis is that the inability of Delta to cluster around the ARS and traffic apically seems to be a highly significant (Fig. 8g) defect as compared to a subtle increase in Delta co - localization to the Rab5 positive compartment (Supplementary Fig. 5e) . Delta processing is unaffected in Arp3 mutants: Wang and Struhl1 have suggested that the internalization of Delta leads to a proteolytic cleavage in an unknown compartment. Drosophila full-length Delta (~98 is proteolytically processed into three different isoforms in vivo9 and the short isoform Delta S (~68 kDa) may correspond to the activated form1, 9. During early stages of embryogenesis (0 -6 hours after egg laying , hr AEL) the Delta S isoform is not generated45. At later devel opmental stages (13 -24hr AEL) full-length Delta is much reduced, but the Delta S isoform is far more abundant45. To assay if lack of Arp2/3 function alters Delta we prepared lysates from WT, Arp3 and Arpc1 zygotic mutant embryos at two different developmental time periods , 0-13hr AEL and 13 -19hr AEL , for western blot analysis. We find that processing of Delta is largely unaltered in Arp3 embryos (Supplementary Fig. 7), suggest ing that the processing of Delta may not depend on Arp2/3 function . \u00a9 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Evans,1and Scott Barolo1,* 1Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA *Correspondence: sbarolo@umich.edu DOI 10.1016/j.devcel.2009.12.026 SUMMARY Enhancers integrate spatiotemporal information to generate precise patterns of gene expression. Howcomplex is the regulatory logic of a typical develop-mental enhancer, and how important is its internal organization? Here, we examine in detail the struc- ture and function of sparkling , Pax2 In addition to its 12 previously identied protein-binding sites, sparkling is densely populated with previously unmappedregulatory sequences, which interact in complexways to control gene expression. One segment is essential for activation at a distance, yet dispensable for other activation functions and for cell typepatterning. Unexpectedly, rearranging sparkling 's regulatory sites converts it into a robust photore-ceptor-specic enhancer. Our results show thata single combination of regulatory inputs can encodemultiple outputs, and suggest that the enhancer'sorganization determines the correct expression pattern by facilitating certain short-range regulatory interactions at the expense of others. INTRODUCTION Enhancers, or cis-regulatory elements, are the primary determi- nants of spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression. In order to properly regulate their target genes, enhancers must performa number of functions, such as identifying and communicating with the promoter, sometimes over great distances, and triggering transcription in certain cells, but not in others. Many enhancersare capable of driving a heterologous promoter in the proper pattern when removed from their normal genomic context. This autonomy implies that enhancers can assemble a complete setof biochemical activities that together are sufcient for robust,patterned transcriptional activation at a remote promoter. Do different DNA-binding factors recruit distinct types of activation activities, or must the enhancer merely accumulate enough ofa single limiting activity to exceed a threshold for activation? Different types of studies reach widely divergent conclusions about enhancer complexity. For example, Eric Davidson andcolleagues, combining reporter assays with afnity puricationin an extensive study of cis-regulatory logic in the sea urchin Endo16 gene, identied 55 binding sites for 16 regulatory proteins, which form an intricate regulatory computer spanning2300 bp of DNA ( Davidson, 1999 ). However, most develop- mental genetics-based enhancer studies culminate in modelsrequiring no more than three to ve different regulators (oftenonly one or two), binding within /C24300-1000 bp of DNA, to explain the activity and specicity of a seemingly typical enhancer. In thevery rare cases in which the question of sufciency is addressedin vivo, the dened regulatory sites are generally insufcient to reconstitute enhancer function, and an unknown acti- vator, ''X,'' is added to the model (reviewed by Barolo and Posakony, 2002 ). How many cis-regulatory sites are sufcient, when combined, to recapitulate normal enhancer function, in the context of a chromosome in a normal cell? We have pursued a bottom-up approach to these questions by taking a previously well-characterized developmentalenhancer and exhaustively dissecting it in vivo, both to discover the extent of its regulatory complexity and to determine whetherdifferent enhancer subelements perform distinct functions. We chose to study the sparkling (spa) enhancer of the dPax2 gene, which is necessary and sufcient to specify the cone cell fate in certain multipotent cells in the developing Drosophila eye (Fu and Noll, 1997; Fu et al., 1998; Flores et al., 2000; Shi and Noll, 2009 ).spa drives cone cell-specic dPax2 expression in response to four direct regulators, acting through 12 transcrip-tion factor-binding sites (TFBSs): Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)), under the control of Notch signaling; two Ets factors, the acti- vator al., 1998; Flores et al., 2000; Tsuda et al., 2002 )(Figure 1 A). In their report describing the direct regulation of the spaenhancer by Su(H), Lz, and Ets factors, Flores et al. (2000) proposed a model in which a combinatorial code, Lz + EGFR/Pnt/Yan + Notch/Su(H), determines the cell-type speci- city of spaactivity. The authors were careful to state that ''the model.reflects requirements rather than sufciency for cell fate specication.'' Despite this caveat, the Lz + Ets + Su(H)code is now considered to ''dene the combinatorial inputrequired for cone cell specication'' ( Voas and Rebay, 2004 ; see also Pickup et al., 2009; Shi and Noll, 2009 ). Because the spaenhancer is small (362 bp), and because the known regulatory inputs could, in theory, explain its cell type specicity ( Flores et al., 2000 ), we considered it an ideal test case for a comprehensive structure-function analysis. Here, we Developmental Cell 18, 359-370, March 16, 2010 \u00aa2010 Elsevier Inc. 359report the results of our initial tests, which reveal several surprising aspects of spaenhancer function in vivo. RESULTS For our in vivo analysis of the spaenhancer, we used a specially built Gateway reporter transgene vector, Ganesh-G1, in which enhancers are placed upstream of a minimal, TATA-containing promoter taken from the Drosophila Hsp70 gene, driving an EGFP-NLS reporter ( Swanson et al., 2008 ). An important feature of this vector is that the enhancer is placed 846 bp upstreamfrom the transcription start site ( Figure 1 A), so that in all experi- ments presented here (except those in Figure 4 ), the enhancer is forced to act at a moderate distance from the promoter. We do not consider this an unfair test of enhancer activity, given that, in its native genomic context, spais located > 7 kb from thedPax2 promoter ( Fu et al., 1998 ). We generated at least four independent transgenic lines for each reporter construct.Because line-to-line variability was generally low, we foundthat examination of 3-5 independently derived lines was suf-cient for most constructs. For constructs with more variable expression (usually those with low activity), we examined additional lines (10-14) to ensure that our conclusions were notbased on rare insertion effects. Table S1 (available online) lists all transgenic lines and their expression levels. When placed in Ganesh-G1, spa drives cone cell-specic GFP expression in developing retinas of transgenic larvae andpupae ( Figures 1 B-1D). This and previous work by Flores et al. (2000) demonstrate that the 362 bp spaenhancer contains all sequences necessary to (1) activate gene expression in vivoand (2) restrict this activation to developing cone cells. The (Lz + Pnt + Su(H)) Code Is Insufcient to Specify Cone Cell ExpressionAll three of the known positive regulators of the spaenhancer are required for its activity and cone cell specicity. This sug-gested a ''combinatorial code'' model for dPax2 regulation, in which the combined activities of Lz, Pnt, and Su(H), actingthrough binding sites in spa, cooperatively activate dPax2 expression specically in cone cells ( Flores et al., Tsuda et al., 2002; Nagaraj and Banerjee, 2007 ). We began our analysis by testing the simplest form of such a model, which predicts that the binding sites within spathat mediate those three regulatory inputs should sufce, in combination, to drive gene expression in cone cells. First, we built a synthetic spaenhancer construct in which all 12 of the dened binding sites for Lz, Su(H), and Pnt/Yan withinspaare intact (along with 3-4 flanking base pairs to either side) and are placed in their native arrangement and spacing, but in which all other enhancer sequences are mutated by altering every second base pair. This construct, called spa(synth NS) because of the native spacing of its TFBSs, fails to activate gene expression in vivo ( Figure 1 E). A second version of spa (synthNS), in which the opposite set of base pairs was mutated, produced the same result (not shown). We also created spa (synthCS), a compressed-spacing construct containing the same 12 sites, in which intersite sequences of > 12 bp have been reduced to 12 bp. spa(synthCS) also fails to act as a cone cell enhancer, although weak GFP expression can be detectedin a few noncone cells ( Figure 1 F). Based on these ndings, we hypothesized that additional sequences, besides the 12 denedregulatory sites, are necessary for proper transcriptional regula- tion mediated by spa. Numerous Regulatory Sites within spa, in Addition to the Known Binding Sites, Are Required for Cone CellActivation In order to pinpoint the regulatory sites within spathat make essential contributions to enhancer activity in vivo, we con- ducted a systematic mutational analysis of all previously unchar- acterized sequences within spa. These sequences were divided into regions 1-6, and each region was deleted in turn, leaving theknown TFBSs intact in all cases ( Figure 2 A). Of all segments mutated in this manner, only region 3 makes no signicantcontribution to cone cell expression. Deleting regions 1, 2, 4,or 6 causes total or near-total loss of gene expression in vivo; conversely, deleting region 5 enhances expression in cone cells (Figures 2 A-2G).

To distinguish between these two types of effects, we made native-spacing (NS) mutations inwhich a specic sequence was altered, but its length was preserved. In regions 4 and 6, native-spacing alterations and deletions have similar effects, indicating that the sequencecontent of these regions is functionally signicant ( Figures 2 D, 2G, 2H, and 2K). However, a native-spacing mutation in region 2 has a less severe effect than a deletion ( Figure 2 H; cf. Figure 2 D), from which we infer that much of the regulatory contribution of region 2 can be attributed to its length, ratherthan its sequence. Within region 5, deleting the DNA and altering its sequence have opposing effects. Deleting region 5 augments cone cellexpression, whereas a native-spacing mutation causes a severe loss of activity ( Figures 2 F and 2J). The simplest interpretation of these results is that region 5 harbors positive regulatory sequences that are normally required, but that the deletion brings together sites on either side of region 5, increasingsynergy between transcription factors and thus compensatingfor the loss of regulators normally binding to region 5. Consistent with this interpretation is the fact that Pnt and Lz, which bind to either side of region 5, physically interact and synergistically acti-vate transcription, as can mammalian orthologs of these factors (Flores et al., 2000; Behan et al., 2005 and references therein). The fact that multiple smaller-scale native-spacing mutations within region 5 impair spafunction, while none augment expres- sion (see Figure 3 ), further supports this conclusion. spaIs Densely Packed with Regulatory Sites The analysis described above demonstrates that, in addition tothe dened TFBSs, regions 1, 4, 5, and 6 of spa(and to a lesser extent region 2) are essential for its proper function. Each ofthese segments is large enough to contain several protein- binding sites of typical size. To determine what proportion of these sequences has a regulatory role, we made native-spacingmutations to smaller segments (10 bp, on average) within regions 1, 4, 5, and 6. Of these 12 ner-scale mutations, 10 cause severe or total loss of gene expression in cone cells ( Figure 3 ). In addi-tion, results described below indicate the presence of repressiveregulatory site(s) within spa, but outside of regions 1, 4, 5, and 6. Given that the consensus binding sites for the known regulators ofspaare < 9 bp in length, there is room for many regulatory sites within these regions. Together, the regulatory sites described here and the previously described TFBSs densely populate spa, with apparent ''junk'' or ''spacer'' sequences constituting a small proportion of the enhancer. To investigate the possibility that the regulatory sites in regions 1, 4, 5, and 6 act by facilitating binding of the known activators tonearby binding sites, and the related possibility that these regions contain cryptic or noncanonical binding sites for theknown activators, we tested the ability of Lz and Su(H) to bind to sites within spain vitro. In all cases, mutating the newly char- acterized essential regulatory sequences did not signicantly reduce the afnity of Lz or Su(H) for nearby binding sites, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) competition experiments ( Table S2 ). Pnt does not bind in vitro to any sites flanking regions 1, 4, 5, or 6 ( Flores et al., 2000 ). Therefore, in subsequent experiments, we pursued the possi-bility that the newly characterized regions of spahave functions that differ from those of the Lz/Ets/Su(H)-binding sites. Evidence for a Special Type of Regulatory Site, Specically Mediating Action at a DistanceThe mutational analysis described above dened many regula- tory sites of equal importance to the known Lz/Ets/Su(H) sites. We next attempted to isolate and study an important but poorlyunderstood function of the enhancer: activation at a distance. As mentioned above, all of the enhancer constructs described thus far were placed 846 bp upstream of the promoter, thus forcingthem to act over a moderate distance. If we could rescue the activity of a mutant enhancer by moving it close to the promoter, we reasoned, the mutated region is likely to specically mediateremote enhancer-promoter interactions. Conversely, if a muta-tion cannot be rescued by promoter-proximal placement, it is likely to mediate a different step in gene activation. The wild-type spa enhancer drives the same pattern from /C0121 bp as from /C0846 bp ( Figure 4 A), although activation is noticeably more robust from the more proximal position.

By contrast, enhancers with mutations in regions 4, 5, or 6a remain unable to drive wild-type levels or patterns of gene expression at /C0121 ( Figures 4 C-4E). Interestingly, each of these constructs partially recovers cone cell activity by midpupal stages (not shown), suggesting that these regions may be more critical for the initiation than for the maintenance of gene expression. Simi- larly, Lz/Pnt/Su(H)-binding sites are required even when spais promoter proximal ( Flores et al., 2000 ). Of all regulatory sites within spa, only region 1 is both dispensable for enhancer activity and patterning in a promoter-proximal position, and essential foractivation at a distance. To our knowledge, this is the rst case of a regulatory element found within an enhancer that specically mediates action froma remote position, with no apparent role in patterning of geneexpression or other basic activation functions (see Discussion ). We therefore refer to region 1 as a ''remote control'' element tofunctionally distinguish it from patterning elements within spa,which include the dened TFBSs as well as newly mappedpatterning sites to be discussed below. Future experiments will test the range, potential promoter preferences, and functional properties of this intriguing regulatory element. Unlike the Known Transcription Factors, Region 1 Acts Independently of Its Position within spa Having mapped all essential regulatory sites within spa, we could then ask whether their linear organization influences geneexpression in vivo. First, we tested the structural flexibility ofregion 1, the remote control element (RCE), by moving it from the 5 0end to the 30end of the enhancer. This rearranged enhancer performs normally at /C0846 bp ( Figure 5 G), which indi- cates that the precise position of the RCE, relative to the other regulatory sites within spa, is not a critical factor in its remote activation function. Future experiments will determine thedistance, relative to the enhancer and to the promoter, overwhich the RCE can act. By contrast, the Lz/Ets/Su(H)-binding sites show strong position dependence.

In this gure, all enhancers are proximal to the minimal Hsp70 promoter, at position /C0121 from the transcription start site, compared to /C0846 in all other gures. Because spa drives stronger expression from a promoter-proximal position, these images were collectedat a lower exposure setting than those in other gures.Developmental Cell Structure and Function of an Eye Enhancer 362 Developmental Cell 18, 359-370, March 16, 2010 \u00aa2010 Elsevier Inc.by moving each TFBS (along with flanking sequences) to the position of another, randomly chosen, TFBS. The resultantconstruct, spa(TF scrambled), is only weakly active in cone cells (Figure 5 G). Thus, unsurprisingly but in contrast to the RCE, the conguration of the known TFBSs within spaplays an important role in enhancer function in cone cells. Cell Type Specicity Is Controlled by the Structural Organization of spa The diminished activity of spa(TF scrambled), along with the altered gene expression resulting from deletions in regions2 and 5, suggest that the spatial organization of spaimpacts its transcriptional activity. We next took a different approach to investigate the relationship between structure and function within spa. As we have demonstrated, the 12 dened TFBSs within spa are insufcient for cone cell enhancer activity, even when combined. Likewise, when these TFBSs are mutated, the remaining sequences are incapable of driving transcription(spa(KO)) ( Figure 5 B). Because these two constructs, taken together, include all sequences from spa, we tested whether combining them would reconstitute enhancer activity. The resul-tant rearranged spaconstruct, KO+synth CS, drives strong gene expression in the eye ( Figure 5 C). Three aspects of this nding are worth noting. First, the activity driven by KO+synthCSis robust, exceeding spa(wt) in intensity (Figure 5 C; cf. Figure 5 A). The dened TFBSs, therefore, are capable of acting synergistically with newly mapped activatorsites in spa, even when the enhancer is recongured. This, combined with the in vitro binding data mentioned above,strongly suggests that the regulatory sites we have identiedare not merely extended binding sequences for Lz/Pnt/Su(H). Second, when the TFBSs adjacent to spa(KO) are spread out to mimic their native spacing, gene expression is lost(KO+synth NS,Figure 5 D). The activity of spais apparently highly dependent on close proximity, among the known transcriptionfactors and/or between those transcription factors and previ-ously uncharacterized regulatory sites. Because KO+synth CS and KO+synthNSdiffer by only 29% in total length, and because KO+synthNS, at 730 bp, is not large compared to many enhancers, this extreme dependence on short-range interac-tions was surprising.

Unlike spa(wt), whose activity colocalizes with the cone cell marker protein Cut (Figure 1 D), KO+synthCS-GFP is expressed only in nuclei located basally to Cut+cells ( Figure 5 E). KO+synthCSis active in a subset of basal cells expressing Elav, a marker of photoreceptor (PR) cellfate ( Robinow and White, 1988 ). Based on the position of the two GFP +cells within the Elav+PR cluster, spa(KO+synthCS)'s activity is restricted to PRs 1 and 6 (R1/R6) ( Figure 5 F). Thus, merely rearranging the regulatory sites within spais sufcient to cleanly switch its cell type specicity in vivo. Ectopic Photoreceptor-Specic Transcription Depends on Lz and Ets Sites, Multiple Newly Mapped Regulatory Sequences, and Tight Clustering of Regulatory SitesWe next attempted to identify the regulatory sites responsible for ectopic activity of spain PRs. Combining regions 1, 4, and 6a with the known TFBSs (1+4+6a+synth CS) results in strong R1/R6 expression; removing region 4 from this construct weakens its activity ( Figure 5 I). By selectively mutating TFBSs, we found that R1/R6 expression requires Lz and Ets sites, but not Su(H)sites ( Figure 5 I). This is consistent with the fact that R1/R6 receive MAPK signaling and express Lz at high levels, but do not respond to Notch signaling (reviewed by Voas and Rebay, 2004 ). Based on our remote-versus-proximal enhancer analysis (Figure 4 ), we hypothesized that different regulatory sequences within spa contribute distinct activities to gene activation. If this is so, one type of activity may not be able to functionally substitute for another. We tested this idea by creating tandemrepeats of the synth CSand synthNSconstructs, which contain two copies of each known TFBS, in compressed or nativespacing, respectively. 2Xsynth CSis inactive in cone cells and relatively weakly active in PRs, whereas 2XsynthNSis inactive in all cell types ( Figure 5 J). We therefore conclude that the Lz + Ets + Su(H) combination is insufcient for cone cell activation.Furthermore, the fact that additional Lz/Ets/Su(H) sites fail to compensate for the missing sequences adds support to the idea that some parts of the enhancer perform functions in tran-scriptional activation that are qualitatively distinct from those of the known regulators. Interestingly, when spa(synth NS) is placed at /C0121 bp, we observe occasional position-effect-dependent activity in cone cells (1 out of 7 lines) or PRs (1 of 7 lines) ( Figure S1 ). The pattern of gene expression in these two lines depends on the site oftransgene insertion, which is consistent with the conclusionthat Lz + Ets + Su(H) can contribute to gene expression in multiple cell types, but only in combination with additional regu- latory inputs. A Short-Range, Cell Type-Specic Repressor Activity Prevents spaActivation in Photoreceptors In both spa constructs driving strong ectopic R1/R6 activity, spa(KO+synth CS) and spa(1+4+6a+synthCS), the TFBSs differs from wild-type in two respects:their spacing relative to one another is reduced, and their linear order and position relative to the newly mapped regulatorysequences is altered. Ectopic PR expression, then, could have three possible (nonexclusive) causes: (1) tight transcription factor clustering may increase synergy by Lz and Pnt in R1/R6,or altered spacing between transcription factors and newly map-ped sites may cause (2) inappropriate synergistic activation and/ or (3) weakened repressive interactions in PRs. In order to test these models, and to further explore the role of enhancer struc-ture, we generated compound mutations in multiple regions of spa, while keeping the spacing/arrangement of the remaining sequences intact. First, we simultaneously mutated regions 2, 3, and 6b of spa, none of which are essential for cone cell expression. This construct, spa(m2,3,6b NS), is comparable to spa(wt) in its pattern and levels of expression ( Figure 5 K). Next, we additionally mutated region 5 in this construct to create spa(m2,3,5,6bNS). Remember that when region 5 alone is mutated, cone cell expres- sion is severely reduced, and no ectopic expression is seen(Figures 2J and 3D). However, when region 5 is mutated simulta- neously with regions 2, 3, and 6b, a discrete switch from conecell- to R1/R6-specic expression occurs ( Figure 5 K). Therefore, region 5 mediates repression in PRs, in addition to activationin cone cells. This repressive activity must be redundant with additional repressor site(s) in regions 2, 3, 6b. It must also have a very limited range of action, because moving Lz and Ets sitesto the 3 0end of the enhancer, spain R1/R6. spaEnhancer Evolution: Function Is Conserved Despite Rapid Turnover of Regulatory SequencesTaking this study and previous work into account, spais among the most nely mapped enhancers with respect to regulatorysites essential for function in vivo. We made use of the recentsequencing of multiple Drosophila species genomes ( Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium, 2007 ) to investigate the evolutionary history of spa. We will focus on the D.melanogaster - D.pseudoobscura (mel-pse ) comparison, which is commonly used sequence evolution; the two popu- lations diverged /C2425 million years ago (e.g., Ludwig et al., 2005 and references therein). As we will discuss below, blocks ofsequence conservation between melanogaster andpseudoobs- cura spa are relatively few and short, and most TFBSs and newly mapped regulatory sites were not alignable ( Figure 6 A). We were therefore surprised to nd that a 409 bp pseudoobscura sequence we identied as the putative ortholog of spa was able to drive cone cell-specic reporter gene expression in trans-genic D.melanogaster , indistinguishably in pattern and intensity from melanogaster spa , even from /C0846 bp ( Figure 6 B). We wish to point out several notable aspects of spasequence evolution. First, its distribution of sequence conservationappears to be unusual among developmental enhancers. When total mel-pse sequence identity is considered, spafalls only slightly below the range of six well-studied Drosophila enhancers we analyzed for comparison ( Table S3 ). However, spais relatively poor in extended blocks of conserved sequence; it contains only one block of 100% conservation of R10 bp in length (located in region 1, the RCE), constituting 3.9% of the total enhancer sequence. By contrast, in the six reference enhancers, an average of 52% of the sequence lies in perfectly conserved blocks of R10 bp (range is 37%-75%). Even more strikingly, in the six reference enhancers, an average of one-third of the sequence is in perfectly conserved blocks of R20 bp, and spa has no conserved blocks of this length ( Table S3 ). LackDevelopmental Cell Structure and Function of an Eye Enhancer 364 Developmental Cell 18, 359-370, March 16, 2010 \u00aa2010 Elsevier Inc.of sequence conservation does not appear to result from a reshuffling of regulatory sequences, as melanogaster versus pseudoobscura dot-plot analysis does not detect any rearrange- ments within spa(data not shown). Second, of the 12 identied binding sites for Lz, Pnt/Yan, and Su(H), only 3 can be unambiguously aligned with orthologouspredicted binding sites in pseudoobscura . Four other predicted binding sites for these transcription factors were found in the pseudoobscura enhancer, but had no denitive orthologs in melanogaster spa , due to signicant differences in sequence and/or position ( Figure 6 A).

(C) Summary of sparegulation: at least two functionally distinct classes of regulatory sites govern the enhancer activity of spain vivo. sparequires the presence and proper arrangement of many regulatory subelements for its transcriptional activity and cell type specicity. Region 1 appears to be required for remoteenhancer activity, but dispensable for patterning. In addition, proper cell type patterning of spain the developing eye is considerably more complex than previ- ously thought, and it depends on short-range interactions among many regulatory sites. Green arrows indicate activation mediated by sites within spa; red bars indicate cell type-specic repression activities.(D) A simple ''combinatorial code'' model is insufcient to explain the cell-type specicity of spa, as the same regulatory elements can be rearranged to generate transcription in either cone cells or photoreceptors. Thus, any model describing cone cell-specic transcriptional activation by spamust also incorporate rules of spatial organization.Developmental Cell Structure and Function of an Eye Enhancer Developmental Cell 18, 359-370, March 16, 2010 \u00aa2010 Elsevier Inc. 365sites, 2 versus 3 Lz sites, and 5 GGAW consensus Ets sites versus 6 in melanogaster . Third, with respect to the previously uncharacterized sequences within spa, we do not observe a strong correlation between functional signicance and sequence conservation. Of the essential, previously unmapped sequences identied in this report (regions 1, 4, 5abc, and 6a), the total mel-pse sequence identity is not greatly higher than that of sequencesmaking little or no contribution to activation (regions 2, 3, 5d, and 6b) (65% versus 58% identity). Thus, in the context of the spaenhancer, we nd evolutionary sequence conservation to be a poor indicator of functional importance in transcriptional regulation. DISCUSSION The goal of this study was to use a well-characterized, signal- regulated developmental enhancer to examine, in ne detail, the regulatory interactions and structural rules governing tran-scriptional activation in vivo. Taking the elegant work of Flores and colleagues (2000) as a starting point, we have used func- tional in vivo assays to test the power of the proposed combina-torial code of ''Notch/Su(H) + Lz + MAPK/Ets'' to explain theactivity and specicity of the spacone cell enhancer ofdPax2 . In the course of this work, we have discovered several surprising properties of spathat are not accounted for in current models of enhancer function. ThespaPatterning Code Is Massively Combinatorial We chose the spaenhancer for our ne-scale analysis because (1) the known direct regulators and their binding sites are well dened, (2) they could, in theory, constitute the sum total of the patterning information received by the enhancer, and (3) the enhancer, at 362 bp, is relatively small, simplifying mutationalanalyses. To our surprise, a large proportion of the previously uncharacterized sequence within spais vital for normal enhancer activity in vivo, and of that subset, a large proportion directly influences cell type specicity. These ndings are summarizedinFigure 6 C. Activation in Cone Cells In addition to necessary inputs from Lz, Pnt, and Su(H), we have identied three segments of spa, regions 4, 5, and 6, that make essential contributions to gene expression in cone cells. In addi- tion, region 2 makes a relatively minor contribution. (Region 1, another essential domain, will be discussed separately.) Fine-scale mutagenesis reveals that within regions 4, 5, and 6, very little DNA is dispensable for cone cell activation. The previously uncharacterized regulatory sites in spaare very likely bound by factors other than Lz/Pnt/Su(H), for the following reasons: no sequences resembling Lz/Pnt/Su(H)-binding sites reside in these regions; mutations in the newly mapped sites have differenteffects than removing the dened TFBSs or the proteins thatbind them; doubling the known TFBSs fails to compensate for the loss of the newly mapped sequences; and, most importantly, mutating the newly mapped regulatory regions does not signi-cantly affect binding of the known activators to nearby binding sites in vitro ( Table S2 ). We cannot tell whether the proposed novel regulators are cone cell-specic, eye-specic, or ubiqui-tous in their expression\u2014we only know that the newly mapped sites are necessary both for normal cone cell expression and ectopic PR expression. Cut, Prospero, and Tramtrack are ex- pressed in cone cells, but are thought to act as transcriptionalrepressors (e.g., Lai and Li, 1999; Cook et al., 2003; Seto et al., 2006 ). The transcription factor Hindsight is required for dPax2 expression and cone cell induction, but acts indirectly, activatingDelta in R1/R6 to induce Notch signaling in cone cells ( Pickup et al., 2009 ). Unsurprisingly, placing the enhancer closer to the promoter boosts expression of spa(wt), as well as some of the impaired mutants ( Figure 4 ). Remember that spais located at +7 kb in its native locus, and that nearly all mutational studies place theenhancer immediately upstream of the promoter. If our entireanalysis had been performed at /C0121 bp, we would have under- rated the functional signicance of several critical regulatorysequences, and would have dismissed region 1 entirely as nonre-gulatory DNA. Other well-characterized enhancers, which havebeen analyzed in a promoter-proximal position only, may there- fore contain more critical regulatory sites than is currently realized. Like many transcriptional activators, all three known direct activators of spa(or their orthologs) recruit p300/CBP Posakony, 2002 ). Doubling the number of binding sites for these transcription factors (to 6 Lz, 8 Ets, and10 Su(H) sites) does not sufce to drive cone cell expression in the absence of the newly mapped regulatory regions ( Figure 5 ). It may be, then, that factors recruited to the newly mapped regu- latory sites within spaemploy mechanisms that are distinct from those of the known activators. The remote activity of spa, medi- ated by region 1, appears to be an example of such a mechanism. Cell Type Specicity We were able to convert spainto a R1/R6-specic enhancer in three ways: (1) by moving the dened TFBSs to one side of theenhancer in a tight cluster; (2) by placing Lz and Ets sites nextto regions 1, 4, and 6a; and (3) by mutating regions 2, 3, 5, and 6b within spawhile maintaining the native spacing of all other sites. From these experiments, we conclude that spacontains short-range repressor sites that prevent ectopic activation in PRs Lz + Pnt + regions + 6a. spacontains at least two redun- dant repressor sites, because both region 5 and regions 2, 3, and6b must be mutated to attain ectopic which encodes is activated by Lz in R1/R6/R7, but is also presentin cone cells ( Wildonger et al., 2005 , and references therein), making it an unlikely repressor of spa.seven-up , another known transcriptional repressor, is expressed therefore act spain PRs ( Mlodzik et al., 1990; Cooney et al., 1993 ). However, we did not identify putative Seven-up-binding sites Phyllopod, an E3 ubiquitin ligase represses dPax2 and the cone cell fate in R1/R6/R7, but the transcription factor mediating this effect isnot yet known ( Shi and Noll, 2009 ). Perhaps the best candidate for a PR-specic direct repressor of spaisBar, which encodes the redundant transcriptionfactors and BarH2. Barexpression is activated by Lz and is required for R1/R6 cell fates ( Higashijima et al., 1992; Crew et al., 1997 ). Furthermore, misexpression of BarH1Developmental Cell Structure and Function of an Eye Enhancer 366 Developmental Cell 18, 359-370, March 16, 2010 \u00aa2010 Elsevier Inc.in presumptive cone cells can transform them into PRs ( Hayashi et al., 1998 ). It is unclear whether Bar-family proteins act as repressors, activators, or both. BarH1/2 can bind sequences containing the homeodomain-binding core consensus TAAT(Noyes et al., 2008 ), and region 5 of spa contains two TAAT motifs (underlined in Figure 6 A). Future studies will explore the possibility that Bar directly represses spain PRs. The combinatorial code of spa, then, requires multiple inputs in addition to Lz, MAPK/Ets, and Notch/Su(H). Indeed, our data suggest that the known regulators can contribute to expression in multiple cell types, depending on context. The newly mappedcontrol elements we have identied within spaare necessary not only to facilitate transcriptional activation, but also to steer theLz + Ets + Su(H) code toward cone cell-specic gene expression. Functional Evidence for a Special Enhancer Regulatory Element, Mediating Remote Interactions, but NotPatterning Enhancers are often located many kilobases from the pro- moters they regulate. Enhancer-promoter interactions oversuch distances are very likely to require active facilitation ( Rippe, 2001 ). Even so, few studies have focused specically on tran- scriptional activation at a distance, and the majority of thiswork involves locus control regions (LCRs) and/or complex multigenic loci, which are not part of the regulatory environment of most genes and enhancers (e.g., Yoshida et al., 1999; Carter et al., 2002; Song et al., 2007 ). Like spa, many developmental enhancers act at a distance in their normal genomic context,yet can autonomously drive a heterologous promoter in theproper expression pattern, without requiring an LCR or otherlarge-scale genomic regulatory apparatus. However, in nearly all assays of enhancer function, the element to be studied is placed immediately upstream of the promoter. In such cases,regulatory sites specically mediating remote interactions cannot be identied. Because our initial mutational analysis of spawas performed on enhancers placed at a moderate distance from the promoter ( /C0846 bp), we were able to screen for sequences required only at a distance, by moving crippled enhancers to a promoter-proximal position. Only one segmentofspa, region 1, was absolutely essential at a distance but completely dispensable near the promoter. This region, which contains the only block of extended sequence conservation within spa, plays no apparent role in patterning, or in basic acti- vation at close range. We therefore call this segment of spa a ''remote control'' element (RCE). The remote enhancer regulatory activity described here differs from previously reported long-range regulatory mechanisms in two important ways. First, the remote function of spadoes not require any sequences in or near the dPax2 promoter. This func- tionally distinguishes spafrom enhancers Hox complexes require promoter-proximal ''tethering elements'' and/or function by overcoming insulators (e.g., Calhoun et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2005; Akbari et al., 2008 ). This distal activation mechanism also likely differs from enhancer-promoter interac- tions mediated by proteins that bind at both the enhancer and the promoter, as occurs in looping mediated by ER, AR, andSp1 ( Wang et al., 2005; Williams et al., 2007; Pan et al., 2008 ). Second, studies of distant enhancers of the cutandUltrabithorax genes have revealed a role for the cohesin-associated factorNipped-B, especially with respect to bypassing insulators(Misulovin et al., 2008 , and references therein), but it has not been demonstrated that Nipped-B, or any other enhancer-binding regulator, is required only when the enhancer is remote. To our knowledge, the spaRCE is the rst enhancer subele- ment demonstrated to be essential for enhancer-promoter inter-actions at a distance, but unnecessary for proximal enhancerfunction and cell type specicity. However, the present workcontains only a limited examination of this activity, as part of a broader study of enhancer function. We are currently extending these functional studies, testing for potential promoter prefer-ences and distance limitations, and pursuing the identities of factors binding to the RCE. Enhancer Structure: Shaped and Constrained by Short-Range Patterning Interactions As discussed above, it is fairly easy to switch spafrom cone cell expression to R1/R6 expression (though, curiously, we have yet to generate a construct that is active in both cell types). Ourresults show that multiple regions of spamediate a repression activity in R1/R6, but not in cone cells. We further concludethat these spa-binding repressors act in a short-range manner; that is, they must be located very near to relevant activator- binding sites, because moving Lz and Pnt sites to one side of spa, without removing the repressor sites (KO+synth CS), abol- ishes repression. Despite this failure of repression, synergistic interactions among Lz and Ets sites and the newly mapped sites still occur in this reorganized enhancer\u2014at least in R1/R6cells. Cone cell-specic expression is lost, however, revealing(along with other experiments) that transcriptional activation in cone cells is highly sensitive to the organization of regulatory sites within spa. Slightly wider spacing of regulatory sites (KO+synth NS) kills the enhancer altogether, suggesting that synergistic positive interactions within spa, though apparently longer in range than repressive interactions, are severely limitedin their range. The structural organization of spa, then, appears to be constrained by a complex network of short-range positiveand negative interactions ( Figure 6 D). Activator sites must be spaced closely enough to trigger synergistic activation in cone cells; at the same time, repressor sites must be positioned to disrupt this synergy in noncone cells, preventing ectopicactivation. Recent work by Crocker et al. (2008) has shown that changes to enhancer organization can ''ne-tune'' the output of a combi-natorial code, subtly changing the sensitivity of the enhancer toa morphogen. Given the importance of the structure of the spa enhancer for its proper function, we propose that anycombina- torial code model, no matter how complex, is insufcient todescribe the regulation of spa, because the same components can be rearranged to produce drastically different patterns. Conservation of spaFunction Despite Lack of Sequence Conservation: Insights into Enhancer Structure One might expect that the regulatory and organizational complexity of the spaenhancer, and its extreme sensitivity to mutation, would be reflected in strict evolutionary constraints upon enhancer sequence and structure. Yet, we observe very poor conservation of spasequence, both in the known TFBSs and in most of the newly mapped essential regulatory elements.Developmental Cell Structure and Function of an Eye Enhancer Developmental Cell 18, 359-370, March 16, 2010 \u00aa2010 Elsevier Inc. 367The reduced presence of Lz/Ets/Su(H) sites in D.pse could potentially be attributed to redundancy of those sites in D.mel, or to compensatory gain of binding sites for alternate factors in theD.pse enhancer. Perhaps more difcult to understand is the apparent loss of critical regulatory sequences in regions 4, 5, and 6a in D.pse; our experiments in D.melsuggest that the absence of those inputs would result in loss of cone cell expres- sion and/or ectopic activation. It remains possible that many ofthese inputs are in fact conserved, but that conservation is not obvious due to binding site degeneracy and/or rearrangement of elements within the enhancer. Fine-scale comparative studiesare ongoing. spa is by no means the rst example of an enhancer that is functionally maintained despite a lack of sequence conserva-tion (for a review of this topic, see Wittkopp, 2006 ). The most thoroughly characterized example of this phenomenon istheeve stripe 2 enhancer; its function is conserved despite changes in binding site composition and organization ( Ludwig et al., 2000, 2005; Hare et al., 2008 ). Note, however, that spa has undergone much more rapid sequence divergence thanevestripe 2 ( Figure 6 ;Table S3 ), with no apparent change in function. In general, the ability of an enhancer to maintain its function in the face of rapid sequence evolution suggests that enhancer structure must be quite flexible. These observationssupport the ''billboard'' model of enhancer structure, which proposes that as long as individual regulatory units within an enhancer remain intact, the organization of those units withinthe enhancer is flexible ( Arnosti and Kulkarni, 2005 ). Yet, our ndings concerning the importance of local interactions amongdensely clustered, precisely positioned transcription factorsare more consistent with the tightly structured ''enhanceosome''model ( Thanos and Maniatis, 1995 ). Further structure-function analysis will be necessary to fully understand the players andrules governing this regulatory element. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Generation of Enhancer Constructs The 362 bp sparkling enhancer was amplied from w1118genomic DNA with the following primers: D.pseudoobscura spa enhancer following 0-CACCGGATCCgtctcaaataacttcgtgtc-30;50-GGGTCTAGAcacaggaagccgg aaactg-30. The lower-case sequence is homologous to genomic DNA. Most mutant spa constructs were generated by one of three PCR tech- niques: (1) amplication of spa(wt) with tagged primers to create mutations at the 50or 30end; (2) overlap extension (sewing) PCR to generate internal mutations; or (3) assembly PCR to synthesize enhancers with multiple muta-tions. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for complete sequences of all enhancer constructs. Mutagenesis by Overlap Extension PCR When targeting mutations in the interior of spa, such as in constructs m4A, m4-rs, etc., we separately amplied 5 0and 30fragments, by using overlapping tagged primers to integrate mutated sequence, and then joined the fragmentsby using overlap extension (sewing) PCR (Swanson et al., 2008 and references therein). In our sewing PCR protocol, the 5 0and 30fragments (which overlap by 20 bp) were separately PCR amplied and gel puried. We combined 3 mlo f each gel-puried fragment with 33.5 ml water, 1.5 ml1 0mm dNTPs, and 5 ml 103PCR buffer (Roche Expand High Fidelity PCR System). This mix was incu- bated at 90/C14C for 10 min, then cooled one degree per min to 72/C14C. A total of 1 ml polymerase mix (Roche Expand High Fidelity PCR System) was then added,followed by incubation for 10 min at 72 /C14C. Finally, 1.5 ml of each flanking50and 30primer (15 pmol each) was added, and the full-length construct was amplied in our standard PCR program (94/C14C for 2 min; 10 cycles of 94/C14C for 15 s, 55/C14C for 30 s, 72/C14C for 45 s; 20 cycles of 94/C14C for 15 s, 55/C14C for 30 s, 72/C14C for 45 s + 5 s/cycle; 72/C14C for 7 min). Assembly PCRIn constructs with extensive mutated sequence (such as spa(mut) and spa (synth)), constructs were built by annealing overlapping 40 bp oligonucleotidesto create the full-length construct by assembly PCR ( Swanson et al., 2008 and references therein). We combined 2.5 ml of each flanking primer (10 mM), 1 ml internal primer mix (each primer at 0.25 mM), 1 ml1 0m M dNTPs, and 18 ml sterile water in the template mix. The enzyme mix contained 19.25 ml sterile water, 5 ml 103PCR buffer, and 0.75 ml DNA polymerase (Roche Expand High Fidelity PCR System). The template mix and enzyme mix were combined immediatelybefore amplication in our standard PCR program (see above). In mutating previously uncharacterized enhancer sequences, we made noncomplementary transversions to every other base pair. We left 2-4 bp of nonmutated sequence to either side of every TFBS (as dened by consensus sequences), to avoid interfering with transcription factor binding. In mutatingTFBSs, we converted Lz sites from RACCRCA to RA AARCA; Ets sites from GGAW to TTAW; and Su(H) sites from YGTGDGAA (or related sequence) to YGTGD CAA; these changes eliminate transcription factor binding in vitro (Barolo et al., 2000; Flores et al., 2000 ; references therein). Enhancer Cloning, Vectors, and TransgenesisPCR-amplied enhancer constructs were TOPO cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). spa(synth CS) was created by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides and ligating them into the Gateway donorvector pBS-ENTR-TOPO (Swanson et al., 2008 ). Subcloned constructs were then Gateway cloned into the Ganesh-G1 GFP reporter vector (Swansonet al., 2008 ) via LR recombination (Invitrogen), with the following exception: constructs placed at /C0121 bp from the promoter (Figure 4 ) were Gateway cloned into Ganesh-G2, which lacks the 0.7 kb spacer sequence betweenthe recombination cloning site and the promoter ( Swanson et al., 2008 ). P element transformation was performed essentially as described by Rubin and Spradling (1982) .w 1118flies were used for transgenesis.

In epithelia, contractile forces are resisted at apical junctions b y adhesive forces dependent on E-cadherin16, which also transmits tension6,17-19. During Drosophila embryonic germband extension, tissue elongation is driven by cell intercalation20, which requires an irreversible and planar polarized remodelling of epithelial cell junctions4,5.W ei n v e s t i g a t eh o wc e l l deformations emerge from the interplay between f orce generation and cortical force transmission during this remodelling in Drosophila melanogaster . The shrinkage of dorsal-ventral-oriented ('vertical') junctions during this process is known to require planarpolarized junctional contractility by Myosin II (refs 4, 5, 7, 12). Here weshow that this shrinkage is not produ ced by junctional Myosin II itself, but by the polarized flow of med ial actomyosin pulses towards 'vertical' junctions. This anisotr opic flow is oriented by the planar polarized distribution of E-cadherin complexes, in that medialMyosin II flows towards 'vertical' junctions, which have relatively lessE-cadherin than transverse junctio ns. Our evidence suggests that the medial flow pattern reflects equilibrium properties of force transmis-sion and coupling to E-cadherin by a-Catenin. Thus, epithelial mor- phogenesis is not properly reflected by Myosin II steady statedistribution but by polarized contractile actomyosin flows that emergefrom interactions between E-cadherin and actomyosin networks. The planar polarized remodelling of cell junctions 4,5that occurs during germband extension (GBE) is shown in Fig. 1a. Myosin II (Myo-II) is concentrated in 'vertical' junctions4,21and directs junction shrinkage by increasing junctional tension7,12. To understand how Myo-II planar polarity is established, we investigated changes in Myo-II distribution at the onset of GBE. We used a fusion betweenMyo-II regulatory light chain (MRLC, called Sqh in is formed, MRLC-Cherry isvisible in aggregates the medial region of AJs (Fig. 1b). Sub-sequently, MRLC-Cherry is also detected at the of AJs of inter-calating cells (Fig. 1b). An MRLC-GFP fusion rescuing a null sqh AX3 mutant (Fig. 1c) and an antibody against endogenous Myo-II heavychain (not shown) displayed the same features. Thus two Myo-IIpopulations exist during cell intercalation: a medial and a junctionalpool (Supplementary Fig. 1). Labelling of F-actin with Utrophin-GFP(Utr-GFP) shows a network spanning the AJs (Fig. 1d, SupplementaryFig. 1, Supplementary Movie 1a). This network is thin ( ,500 nm), and contains filaments at low density (mesh size 0.5-2 mm) that overlap and intersect in the form of brighter puncta, which are more apparentin a slightly less apical focal plane intersecting the AJs (Supplementary Movie 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, both Myo-II pools are part of a large-scale actomyosin network, spanning multiple cells, which con-trasts with previous descriptions focused on junctional actin and Myo-II (refs 4, 5, 7, 12, 18, 21-23). Live imaging of Utr-GFP and MRLC-GFP indicated complex dynamics (Supplementary Movies 1a, b and 2). The F-actin meshfluctuated, with the mesh changing size in a few tens of seconds(Fig. 1d and Supplementary Movie 1a, b).

Both medial and junctional Myo-II, respectively in the vicinity of and at shrinking junctions, fluctuated in intensity (Fig. 1f). In addition to being pulsed, the intensity of junctional Myo-II gradually increased(Fig. 1g). Meanwhile, the changes in 'vertical' junction length are irre-gular, showing successive steps of shrinkage and arrest (Fig. 1i). In somecases, however, transient relaxation was observed (17.6%, N517). To disentangle this complex behaviour and relate contractile dynamics of medial and junctional networks with junction shrinkage,we conducted temporal cross-correlation of fluorescence intensity(Online Methods). Correlation between temporal profiles of MRLC-GFP intensity at the junctions and in the medial regions is high (mean ,R.50.86, Fig. 1h), indicative of similar overall dynamics. Moreover, medial pulses precede junctional pulses by 8 64 s (mean 6s.d. here- after, Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 3). We then compared rates of junction shrinkage with rates of MRLC- GFP intensity changes (Fig. 2a left), which correspond to local accumu- lations of Myo-II by contraction (Fig. 1e). The maximum of the MRLC-GFP contraction rate in the medial region precedes that of junctionalMRLC-GFP by an average of 10.5 62.5 s (Fig. 2b left). Thus contraction of Myo-II occurs in the medial region first and subsequently at junctions(Fig. 2b left, right). Each step of junction shrinkage was associated withtandem medial and junctional Myo-II pulses (Fig. 2a right, indicated that the peak rate of junc- tion shrinkage precedes that of junctional Myo-II accumulation by 963 s (Fig. 2b left), indicating that junctional Myo-II accumulation cannot cause the shrinkage steps. However, peak junction shrinkage rate temporally coincided with the peak rate of medial Myo-II contrac- tion (Fig. 2b left, right) suggesting a mechanical contribution to shrink- age increments. To test this, we used laser nanodissection 12to locally disrupt medial Myo-II clusters at the vicinity of shrinking junctions. Each ablationpulse produced a collapse of the Myo-II pulse and a transient and reversible relaxation of junction length without affecting junctional Myo-II (Fig. 2c left, right, Supplementary Movie 4). Thus, medial Myo-II mechanically causes junction shrinkage. This led us to investi-gate the function of junctional Myo-II pulses, as previous studies showed it was essential for global junction shrinkage 4,7,12. Close inspec- tion reveals two followed successfully without relaxation 2a right); (2) (12%) medial pulses are not followed by junctional pulses and shrinkage steps relax in all cases (Fig. 2d). Relaxation correlates with failure to sustain junctional Myo-II and with an overall decreaseof Myo-II at junctions (Fig. 2d left, right). This suggests that junctional Myo-II stabilizes junction length. Together these observations point to a mechanical 'division of labour', where medial Myo-II pulses shrink, and Myo-II accumulation stabilizes, junction length. This iterative cycleensures persistent shrinkage. 29 s 24 s 49 s Ablation 1 Ablation 2 Ablation 3MRLC-GFPAblation Time0 3.6 170 160 02 0 4 06 01503.2 1.20 1.151.101.05 0 100 200 300 contraction rate 2.04 3 21 0 100 200 300 4002.02 2.001.20 1.15 have different mechanical roles. a , Left: cartoon depicting a vertical junction (length l) and regions where medial and junctional Myo-II are measured.

Indeed, medial pulses show a planar polarized 3a right) in the medial region of cells, we determined the integrated intensity ratio of (A1P)/(D 1V) MRLC-GFP in time series (Fig. 3a a significant Kru \u00a8ppel (Kr) RNAi embryos where planar cell polarization is affected 4,20(Fig. 3a left, Supplementary Movie 6). We next investigated the spatial dynamics of medial and junctional actomyosin networks. Co-imaging of Utr-GFP velocimetry (PIV) indicated that F-actin and Myo-II have very similar dynamics and that actomyosin clusters flowin the plane of the medial region (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Movie 3). Myo-II was moving slightly (22%) but consistently faster than F-actin (Supplementary Fig. 5), in agreement with the idea that Myo-II is responsible for flow.Tracking of Myo-II speckles (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Movies 2, 5) or of F-actin with Myo-II (Supplementary Fig. 2b) indicated that the polarized distribution of medial Myo-II results from the lateral flowof medial pulses towards 'vertical' junctions. In KrRNAi embryos, this movement occurred randomly (Supplementary Movie 6), consistentwith the loss of medial Myo-II polarity (Fig. 3a left). The polarized flow of Myo-II (0.11 60.03mms 21) could either reflect a movement of Myo-II minifilaments or the propagation ofcontractile waves. We tested these alternatives by photobleachingmedial MRLC-GFP clusters. The fluorescence recovery in thebleached area (recovery 34 610% (N 55),t 1/25461s , Supplementary Fig. 6a, b, d) was low c ompared to the junctions (recovery fractions ,70% (ref. 8), not shown). Moreover, no new cluster appears in the vicinity of bleached pulses, as would be expected for contractilewaves (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Together this indicates that medialflows correspond to the movement of relatively stable Myo-II fila-ments. Fluorescence recovery after 622%, N55) turnover within,3 s (Supplementary Fig. 6c, d), suggesting that the actomyosin flow is mainly determined by Myo-II contractility on a fast-recycling,'permissive' actin substrate. We then addressed whether medial pulses are transferred to the junctional cortex and cause of two pools andshowed fusion of medial Myo-II (red) to the cortex and formation of ajunctional pulse (green) (Fig. 3d left, right; Supplementary Movie 7).No transfer of medial pulses occurred to the adjacent junction follow-ing their ablation (Fig. 2c right). Moreover, photobleaching of MRLC-GFP along a junction (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b; Supplementary Movie8) indicates two sources of exchange: pre-existing Myo-II patches arerapidly and strongly recovered (72 66%), consistent with previous reports 7; new junctional patches form de novo where medial Myo-II clusters fuse with junctions. Junctional Myo-II pulses are delayed by ,8 s relative to medial ones (Supplementary Fig. 3), reflecting a speed of transfer of ,0.125 mms21, which is similar to the direct flow speed measurements (0.11 6 0.03mms21). Thus, medial and junctional actomyosin networks have tightly coordinated and hierarchically organized mechanical functions.Medial pulses flow to and produce steps of shrinkage of the adjacent'vertical' junctions. They subsequently fuse with junctions and sustainjunctional Myo-II accumulation, which stabilizes junction length. Thisflow and transfer are planar polarized, and drive junctional planarpolarity and cell intercalation. What controls the planar polarized flow of medial Myo-II pulses to vertical junctions? Mechanical anchoring of actomyosin networks atAJs is essential for force production during cell morphogenesis 6,17-19,25. The medial network is also potentially connected to the apical plasmamembrane given its tight apposition (Supplementary Fig. 8). Imagingof the apical plasma membrane with palmitoylated YFP (GAP43-Venus) revealed however a flat apical surface in the medial part ofintercalating cells with few, small protrusions (Supplementary Fig. 9,Supplementary Movie 9), unlike apically constricting mesoderm cellswhere the plasma membrane is strongly ruffled (Supplementary Movie10). These protrusions display local jitter but no aggregation or flowpatterns characteristic of the underlying actomyosin network, suggest-ing moderate coupling (Supplementary Fig. 9, Supplementary Movie9). Co-imaging of GAP43-Cherry and had un-correlated trajectories (Supplemen-tary Movie 11) or moved at different speeds (Supplementary Movie 12;3.7-fold reduced lateral dynamics (0.03 60.015 mms 21, Supplemen- tary 9) surface and the medial actomyosin network are in contact but moderately coupled. 20 cells 4 embryos 10 cells 2 embryos 15 cells 3 embryos (A+P)/(D+V)WTgermband s 160 s 50 st0 t1 t2t0t1t2A P ROID Va b Utrophin-GFP MRLC-CherryPIV 0 s 1 s 24 sMRLC-GFP -20 sc 0 s 35 s 03 z (m) 0.5 Time (s)0.4 0 medial in (A 1P) regions over (D 1V) regions (see diagram at right for nomenclature) in the germband of wild-type (WT) and Kru \u00a8ppel and E-cad-GFP. b, Comparative PIV of Utr-GFP and MRLC-Cherry in a cell outlined in red.

All rights reserved \u00a92010This suggested that the anisotropic actomyosin flow may largely depend on the distribution of junctional anchoring points. This requires E-cadherin/ b-Catenin on a-Catenin18,26. E-cadherin/ complexes are planar polarized5(not shown), such that medial pulses flow towards regions with lower amounts of E-cadherin complexes. The level of E-cadherinalong 'vertical' relative to adjacent junctions (E-cadherin anisotropy,Fig. 4a left) is also fluctuating (Fig. 4a middle). Moreover, the onset ofmedial pulses coincided with the time when E-cadherin anisotropyreached a local maximum (Fig. 4a middle, right) raising the possibilitythat E-cadherin anisotropy may orient the actomyosin flow. the disappearance of medial Myo-II(Fig. 4b top, c top; Supplementary Movies 13, 14). The junctionalMyo-II level is consequently strongly reduced and no longer planarpolarized (Fig. 4b bottom, c bottom). We reasoned that reducing thelevels of a-Catenin by RNAi should attenuate coupling more subtly. RNAi the number of clusters at AJs interactions F-actin 18. Moreover, the distri- bution of E-cadherin is no longer planar polarized in a-CateninRNAi embryos (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 10). This is associated with a lossof medial (Fig. 4f, Supplementary Movie 15) and junctional (Fig. 4dtop, bottom) Myo-II planar polarity. Thus, the planar polarized dis-tribution of E-cadherin/ b-Catenin/ a-Catenin complexes biases the flow of Myo-II and junctional polarization. In addition to Myo-II contractility, flow requires (1) crosslinkers between filaments to transmit tension within the medial meshwork,and (2) coupling at the cortex to E-cadherin/ complexes. Increased levels of E-cadherin in 'transverse' junctionsmay change properties of the actin network (for example, crosslinking/viscosity) and inhibit internal transmission of contractile forces andhence prevent D-V oriented flow. To test this, we disrupted the forcebalance within the medial actomyosin network by focal ablation (Fig. 4gtop, bottom), and imaged the redistribution of medial clusters. Ifincreased E-cadherin levels at transverse junctions inhibit tensiontransmission the D-V axis, then medial pulses should not flowin this direction following ablation. However, we observed that Myo-IImedial clusters flowed radially and away from the point of ablationtowards the junctions (velocity v50.0560.01mms 21) in 100% of cases (N 525), even towards transverse junctions (12/25 cases, Fig. 4g top, bottom; Supplementary Supplementary Movie16).

The mechanical properties of the medial actomyosin network are locally defined by Myo-II contractility (concentration, affinity, dutycycle), tension transmission within the network (crosslinking), and viscous resistance to deformations (interactions between filaments) 27,28. Moreover, these properties fluctuate owing to protein turnover andinteractions. E-cadherin is known to anchor 18,26and modify actin dynamics29,30. Our results suggest that the polarized distribution of E-cadherin may control the actomyosin flow pattern by spatially modulating mechanical properties of the actin network. Current models of epithelial morphogenesis centre on Myo-II steady state distribution and associated contractile forces1,2,4,5,7,10,12,14,15. Our data show however that cell deformations cannot be simplyderived from the Myo-II distribution itself, but from two central fea- tures of actomyosin dynamics, namely concentration (pulses) and movement (flow). Pulsed dynamics defines the rhythm and possibly the speed of deformation. Flow pattern, which in the case of intercala- tion is anisotropic, dictates the orientation of cell deformation (Sup- plementary Fig. 12). Flows of Myo-II foci have been reported in the one-cell stage C. elegans embryo 22,24, pointing to a more general property of actomyosin networks15,23. An important future avenue of research will be to investigate what properties of actin networks control Myo-II flow dynamics in different systems. METHODS SUMMARY Mutants and constructs. To visualize Myosin-II we used MRLC fused to eGFP or mCherry and rescuing a protein null sqhAX3mutant. The coding for the fusion of eGFP and the actin binding domain of human Utrophin was obtained from W. Bement. The Utr-GFP clone was cloned by PCR ina pUASp destination vector (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Movies 1a,b) or under the sqhpromoter (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Movie 3). The construct were verified by sequencing. To label the plasma membrane, we used afusion between the palmitoylated GAP43 protein and YFP/Venus expressed by theGAL4/UAS system with the maternal tubGAL4VP16 driver line. GAP43-Cherrywas expressed under the sqhpromoter. RNA interference. We generated by dsRNA probes directed Kru \u00a8ppel described in refs 4, 18. Time-lapse imaging.

Drosophila MRLC is encoded by spaghetti-squash (sqh). All experiments visualizing dynamics of MRLC were looking at MRLC fused to either eGFP or mCherry under the sqhpromoter and rescuing a protein null sqhAX3mutant31. E-cad-GFP was expressed under the ubiquitin promoter ubi- Ecad ::GFP and rescues a null e-cad/shotgun mutant32. The following fly stocks were used.

The plasmid coding for the fusion of eGFP and the actin binding domain of human Utrophin was obtained from W. Bement33. The Utr-GFP fusion was PCR amplified and inserted in the p221DONR GATEWAY plasmid (Invitrogen). The fusion was recombined in a pUASp GATEWAY destination vector (pPW, from T. Murphy, Carnegie Institute) for expression under the maternal tubGAL4VP16driver line (67Gal4) in Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Movies 1a, b, or expression under the sqhpromoter in Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Movie 3. In the latter case, Utr-GFP expression is lower than under the Gal4 system, hence only reveals brighter structures (puncta) also visiblein Supplementary Movie 1a and b and Fig. 1d and not individual filaments contrary to Fig. 1d. To label the plasma membrane we used a fusion between the palmitoylated GAP43 protein and the YFP variant Venus 34expressed by the GAL4 UAS system with the maternal tubGAL4VP16 driver line. GAP43-Cherry was constructedsimilarly and expressed under the sqhpromoter as in ref. 31. RNAi interference. We generated by PCR dsRNA probes directed against \u00a8ppel ,a-catenin , and e-cadherin using the following primers. The underlined sequence is the T7 promoter. The sequence not underlined corresponds to the template sequence. e-cadherin: 533 agggagaccacagagctggctccatcttcagaca. Embryos were injected as described in ref. 35. Time lapse imaging. Embryos were prepared and imaged as detailed in ref. 36, using a spinning disc confocal system (Perkin Elmer) on an inverted Nikon microscope with 100 3/1.4 oil immersion objective. Nano-ablation experiments. We performed nano-dissection experiments with a home-built system. A near-infrared (NIR, 1,030 nm) femtosecond (fs) laser at 50 MHz repetition rate (t-Pulse, Amplitude Systems) was coupled to an inverted microscope (Eclipse TE 2000-E, Nikon). A fast multicolour confocal imagingsystem, based on the Yokogawa spinning disk (Ultraview ERS, Perkin Elmer),was also mounted at a side port of the microscope. Local ablation and fast fluor- escence imaging were thus possible simultaneously. The NIR-fs laser beam is expanded through a 35 telescope and is aligned with the microscope optical path with a dichroic mirror (FF01-750/SP, Semrock) immediately below the objectivelens immersion, Plan Apo VC, Nikon). The collimated beam fills the back aperture of the objective lens which transmits 68% of the incoming NIRlight. Nano-dissections of medial Myo-II were performed by exposing this struc-ture to the tightly focused laser during 1-3 ms with an average power of 360 mW at the back aperture of the objective. Exposure time was controlled by an automated 1.5-mm-diameter mechanical shutter (LS2, Uniblitz). The sample was positionedover the tightly focused laser beam thanks to a computer-controlled mechanicalstage (Scan IM with a Tango2-Desktop controller, Marzhau \u00a8ser). A very similar set- up has already been shown to allow sub-cellular ablations 12. Fluorescence intensity measurements. The intensity of the medial Myo-II is defined as the sum of average intensities of two regions of interest (ROIs) closeto the junction (the centre of the elliptical ROIs were ,1mm away from the junction, Fig. 2a in red). The intensity of the junctional Myo-II is defined as theaverage intensity of a 500-nm-wide stripe along the junction (Fig. 2a in green). TheE-cad anisotropy is the average intensity of a 500-nm-wide stripe along transversejunctions divided by the average intensity measured along the vertical junction (Fig. 4a in blue). Intensity measurements were made by using ImageJ (1.39p version). Analysis were done on time lapse movies (one frame every 1-3 s). Foreach frame, 6-10 z-planes were imaged over 3 mm. For long time lapse imaging (.200 s), bleach correction was performed by using ImageJ. Cross-correlation analysis. Cross-correlation was performed applying Igor Pro (Wavemetrics) cross-correlation function. This function is given by: C(t)~\u00f0 T 0f(t)g(tzt)dt where Trepresents the overall time over which measurements were made, f(t) and g(t) the two cross-correlated functions (taking fas reference), and tthe time delay. The basal signal fminandgminwere subtracted from fandgfunctions respecti- vely before \u00d0T 0(f(t){fmin)2dts \u00d0 T 0(g(t){gmin)2dts Time delay measurements. In Fig. 2b all time delays were measured by cross- correlation. Cross-correlation analysis was assessed by performing a measure of delays between peaks for each cluster of events (for example, Fig. 2 shows threeclusters of events) (see Supplementary Figs 1 and 2 top middle panel). Whencorrelating with contraction rate functions, curves were smoothed by using abinomial algorithm implemented in Igor Pro software. For this analysis five casesof fully intercalating cells (corresponding to 15 clusters of events) were taken fromfive different wild-type MRLC-GFP embryos. Time lapse movies were taken at arate of 1 frame s 21. Each frame consisted in a z-stack of 3 mm (images spaced by 500 nm). Time lapse ranged between 200 and 500 s. Time delays in Fig. 4a, right,were determined as follows. The delay between the E-cad anisotropy peak and themedial Myo-II intensity peak was measured by cross-correlation (the medial Myo-II intensity curve was taken as reference). The time onset of medial Myo-II intensitypulses with respect to medial Myo-II intensity was determined fromthe autocorrelation of the medial Myo-II intensity, which provides a measure of theaverage pulse duration, and therefore a measure of the average delay between pulse onset and pulse intensity peak. Auto-correlation analysis was assessed by perform- ing a measure of delays for each cluster of events (see Supplementary Fig. 2 bottom)as for cross-correlation analysis. For this analysis five cases of intercalating cellswere taken from five different wild-type MRLC-Cherry / E-cad-GFP embryos.Time lapse movies (one frame every 3 s) of both MRLC-Cherry and E-cad-GFPwere taken. Each frame consisted of a z-stack of 3 mm (images spaced by 500 nm). Time lapse ranged between 200 and 500 s. Igor Pro software was used for all timedelay measurements.PIV analysis. PIV was determined with the Mathlab toolbox (procedure MatPIV) developed by J. K. Sveen.Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Fluorescence recovery after photo- bleaching (FRAP) measurements were performed as in Supplementary Fig. 6 usinga confocal LSM510 (Zeiss) with a Plan-Apochromat 100 3/1.3 oil objective and an argon laser (488 nm). Before and after photobleaching, images were acquired atlow laser power (0.1% AOTF, Acousto Optic Tunable Filter) to avoid bleachingand with a pixel size of 40 nm. Photobleaching was performed for 0.9 s at full laserpower over an ROI with 1 mm diameter. Fluorescence recovery was then recorded for 50 s. In Supplementary Fig. 7, we used the photokinesis unit of a Perkin Elmer confocal system for FRAP and the region of interest is a line 5 mm long. 31. Royou, A., Field, C., Sisson, J.

Little is known about the molecu-lar mechanisms controlling the distribution of thischemoattractant in vivo. We demonstrate that the ac-tivity of a second SDF-1/CXCL12 receptor, CXCR7, is crucial for proper migration of PGCs toward their tar- gets. We show that CXCR7 functions primarily in thesomatic environment rather than within the migratingcells. In CXCR7 knocked-down embryos, the PGCsexhibit a phenotype that signies defects in SDF-1agradient formation as the cells fail to polarize effec-tively and to migrate toward their targets. Indeed, so-matic cells expressing CXCR7 show enhanced inter- nalization of the chemokine suggesting that CXCR7 acts as a sink for SDF-1a, thus allowing the dynamicchanges in the transcription of sdf-1a to be mirrored by similar dynamics at the protein level. INTRODUCTION The generation of positional information during development and adult life is crucial for processes ranging from global patterningof the embryo to building of tissues and organs and their mainte- nance. Positional information is often established by factors that spread from a dened source, thereby providing the basis for dif-ferential cellular response along a gradient. The graded distribu- tion of molecules can dictate different fates in response to the signal level at the position where the responding cells reside(e.g., ( Driever and Nu \u00a8sslein-Volhard, 1988; 1992; Nellen et al., 1996 )). Alternatively, cells can respond to the distribution of signaling molecules in the environment by mi-gration directed toward or away from the source of an attractantor a repellent, respectively (e.g., ( Renault and Lehmann, 2006 ). A particularly challenging task is controlling cell migration dur- ing early development, a phase during which a large-scale reor-ganization of embryonic structures results in displacement of sources of guidance cues as well as tissues that serve as sub- strate on which cells migrate. Determining the strategies that al-low cells to reach their target during these stages is thus a major biological question, the answer to which is likely to shed light on the mechanisms governing directed cell migration under less de-manding conditions at other time points in the life of the organism. A useful model for studying guided migration in vivo during early embryogenesis is that of primordial germ cells (PGCs), cellsthat typically migrate from their site of specication to the posi- tion where the gonad develops where they differentiate into gametes (reviewed in Kunwar et al., 2006 ). PGC migration in ze- brash is well understood, particularly since the guidance cue(the chemokine SDF-1a [ Doitsidou et al., 2002 ]) and its receptor (CXCR4b [ Doitsidou et al., 2002; Knaut et al., 2003 ]) are known. Specically, the migration route of the PGCs is tightly correlatedwith dynamic changes in the mRNA expression pattern of the chemoattractant SDF-1a ( Doitsidou et al., 2002; Reichman-Fried et al., 2004 ). The demonstration that CXCR7 is a receptor for SDF-1 ( Bala- banian et al., 2005; Burns et al., 2006 ) ended the seemingly monogamous relationships between this chemokine and its rst-to-be-identied receptor CXCR4. In vitro studies aimed at determining the function of CXCR7 yielded conflicting results. Whereas one study suggested that CXCR7 activation promotescell migration ( Balabanian et al., 2005 ), a more recent study ar- gues that activation of this receptor is not involved in migration. According to the latter work, CXCR7 does not induce calcium mobilization, which normally characterizes the biochemical re-sponse to chemokine binding ( Burns et al., 2006 ). Last, in agree- ment with the results presented above, both CXCR7 ligands,CXCL11 and CXCL12, failed to induce calcium signaling, norcould phosphorylation of either ERK1/2 or Akt/ PKB Proost 2007 ). Irrespective of its biochemical activity, CXCR7 function was found to be essential for proper migration of the posterior lateral line primordium, proving that this receptor indeed participates in controlling cell migration in vivo ( Dambly-Chaudie `re et al., 2007; Valentin et al., 2007 ). Yet, the precise contribution of the receptor to the control of guided cell migration is not known. To determinethe role CXCR7 plays in vivo, we examined its function in the context of zebrash PGC migration. Cell 132, 463-473, February 8, 2008 \u00aa2008 Elsevier Inc. 463In this work we show that in embryos in which CXCR7 function is compromised, PGCs exhibit strongly impaired cell polarity and faulty migration. Strikingly, unlike the other SDF-1a receptor, CXCR4b, whose function is required within the migrating cells, CXCR7 function is exerted primarily in somatic cells. We provideevidence suggesting that CXCR7 effectively reduces the level ofSDF-1a available for PGCs by binding and internalizing the che- mokine and thus serves to sequester it. In this way, CXCR7 lowers the level of the chemoattractant in the environment,thereby permitting rapid dynamic changes in the distribution of the protein in response to alterations in the transcription pattern ofsdf-1a . RESULTS cxcr7 Is Expressed in Zebrash Embryos during the Time When PGCs Migrate toward Their Targets Zebrash PGCs initiate their active migration toward SDF-1a at4.5 hr postfertilization (hpf) (Blaser et al., 2005 ) and reach their - nal target within the next 15 hr ( Weidinger et al., 1999, 2002 ). In situ hybridization and RT-PCR revealed that cxcr7 RNA is not provided maternally ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and 1I) and is transcribed throughout the embryo just before the onset of PGC migration(3.3 hpf, Figures 1 C and 1D). During gastrulation stages, the re- ceptor is expressed in a ring of deep cells (6 hpf, Figures 1 E and 1F), followed by low-level expression and uniform distribu- tion along with stronger expression in specic structures in the nervous system and in mesodermal derivatives ( Figures 1 G and 1H). Unlike the distinct expression of cxcr4b in PGCs ( Doitsidou et al., 2002 ), we not observe specic prominent expression ofcxcr7 in migrating PGCs. Thus, while it is possible that cxcr7 RNA is expressed in PGCs during early stages of development when its expression domain overlaps the location of the PGCs, it is not detectable in the germ cells at later stages ( Figures 1 G and 1H, encircled domains). CXCR7 Function Is Essential for Proper PGC Migration To determine whether CXCR7 plays a role in the migration of PGCs, we have knocked down its activity using morpholino migration was severely affected in em- bryos compromised for the receptor function. The CXCR7loss-of-function phenotype is reminiscent of that of CXCR4b-de- cient embryos such that by the end of the rst day of develop-ment, PGCs failed to form cell clusters at the region where thegonad develops ( Figures 2 A-2C). This phenotype is likely to re- flect defects in cell migration rather than an adverse effect oncell differentiation or survival as the PGCs in manipulated em-bryos show normal expression of various RNA markers such asnanos 1 and h1m(Ko\u00a8prunner et al., 2001; Mu \u00a8ller et al., 2002 ) (Figure 2 C and data not shown). In addition, PGCs in treated em- bryos were able to protect and translate specic mRNAs(Ko\u00a8prunner et al., 2001 )(Figure 2 F), formed the typical perinu- clear granules ( Wolke et al., 2002 )(Figure 2 F), and exhibited nor- mal proliferation ( Figure 2 I). Importantly, by reducing the activity ofCXCR7, the distribution of sdf-1a transcripts was not altered, but the PGCs appeared to be uncharacteristically located out- side of the RNA expression domains of the chemokine ( Figures 2G and 2H). To verify that the observed PGC migration phenotype indeed resulted specically from knockdown of CXCR7 function, wehave the antisense oligonucleotides, while uniformly co- expressing cxcr7 mRNA mutated in a way that rendered it resis- tant to the inhibition. The introduction of cxcr7 mRNA into em- bryos by injection could not mimic the endogenous expressionpattern or level of the receptor and therefore did not result in a complete suppression of the phenotype. Nevertheless, thistreatment led to a dramatic reduction in the severity of the phe-notype, demonstrating that the CXCR7 function is required for proper migration of the PGCs ( Figures 2 K-2L). CXCR7 Function Is Required in Somatic Cells The nding that cxcr7 is not specically expressed in the PGCs, coupled with the fact that the severity of the knockdown pheno- type is signicantly reduced by uniform expression of the recep- tor in the embryo, could indicate that the receptor function is re-quired in the somatic environment rather than in the PGCs themselves. To examine this possibility, we transplanted PGCs Figure 1. Expression Pattern of cxcr7 (A-H) Distribution of cxcr7 mRNA in wild-type embryos during the rst 20 hr of development. In situ hybridization using a cxcr7 -specic probe shows no staining in four- cell stage embryos (A and B), weak uniform expressionat 3.3 hpf (C and D), and enhanced cxcr7 expression in a ring of deep cells at 6 hpf (E and F). At later stages of de-velopment (G and H), uniform cxcr7 expression with en- hanced expression in mesoderm derivatives and in thenervous system is detected, but no expression is ob-served at the region where the PGCs are located (en-circled domains).(I) Absence of maternally provided cxcr7 mRNA as deter- mined by RT-PCR at the indicated stages.

As showninFigures 2 M-2Q, the ability of PGCs to reach their target de- pends on CXCR7 a wild-type somatic environment exhibiteda high rate of arrival at the target ( Figures 2 M, 2N, and 2Q). In con- trast, most of the PGCs transplanted into a CXCR7-depleted en- vironment failed to reach the region where the gonad develops (Figures 2 O, 2P, and 2Q). Importantly, CXCR7 within PGCs did not signicantly affect the ef- ciency with which they arrived at their target (p > 0.17, two-sidedt test). Together, these ndings support the idea that CXCR7function is required in somatic cells rather than in the PGCs.CXCR7 Promotes Internalization of SDF-1a and Clearing of the Chemokine from the Extracellular Space To determine the role CXCR7 plays in somatic cells, we havestudied the subcellular localization of the protein and compared it with that of CXCR4b and SDF-1a. To this end, we have tagged these molecules with fluorescent proteins without affecting theirnormal activity (see Minina et al., 2007 for CXCR4b, Figure S2 for CXCR7, and Movie S1 for SDF-1a) and followed their distribution within the cells. Interestingly, we found that in contrast toCXCR4b that is largely localized to the plasma membrane(Figure 3 A), CXCR7 is enriched in intracellular structures (Figure 3 B). These ndings raised the possibility that CXCR7 binds SDF-1a and, as a result of internalization, sequesters thechemokine in the cell. CXCR7 could thus affect the shape of Figure 2.

We have previously shown that high levels of SDF-1a in the environment trigger the internalization of CXCR4bin germ cells ( Minina et al., 2007 ). Using the subcellular localiza-tion of CXCR4b as a measure for the amount of SDF-1a outside of the cells, we determined the distribution of this receptor under conditions where CXCR7 levels were reduced. Indeed, knockingdown CXCR7 signicantly lowered the level of CXCR4b on the Figure 3.

In addition, introducing antisense oligonucleotides directed against sdf-1 reduced the level of CXCR4b internalization observed in CXCR7-decient embryos (Figure 3 C, right panel). These ndings support the notion that the enhanced CXCR4b internalization in CXCR7 morphants re- sults from higher levels of extracellular SDF-1. To directly ad- dress this idea, we followed the fate of GFP-tagged SDF-1a pro- tein when it encounters cells expressing CXCR7 ( Figure 3 D). Indeed, a marked internalization of SDF-1a by somatic cells ex- pressing CXCR7 was observed (right panel), whereas nontreated cells or cells overexpressing CXCR4b did not exhibit internaliza-tion of the tagged SDF-1a (left and middle panels, respectively). Importantly, in a similar experimental setting, we observed strict colocalization of SDF-1a-EGFP and CXCR7-DsRedMonomer(Figure 3 E), supporting the idea that SDF-1a internalization is mediated by CXCR7. To examine the fate of the internalized SDF-1a protein, we compared the localization of the protein with that of the lysosomal marker LAMP-1. For this purposewe transplanted cells expressing CXCR7 and DsRed-tagged LAMP-1 into SDF-1a-EGFP-expressing hosts and detected SDF-1a accumulation in many of the labeled lysosomes(Figure 3 F). Similar results were obtained when the lysosomes were labeled using the LysoTracker reagent ( Figure S3 ). These results suggest that CXCR7 could reduce the time the chemokine is present in the extracellular space, thus permittingthe formation of a gradient as well as dynamic alterations in thedistribution of the molecule during development. To test this hy-pothesis more directly, we have assayed the potency of cells ex- pressing CXCR7 in depleting SDF-1a from their environment. In this experiment, SDF-1a-conditioned medium was incubatedwith human cells expressing zebrash CXCR7, and the activity level in inducing CXCR4b internalization served as a measure for the remaining amount of the chemokine. Indeed, cells ex-pressing CXCR7 effectively depleted SDF-1a from the medium as compared with the cells transfected with an empty vector or cells expressing CXCR4b ( Figures 3 G-3K). CXCR7 Function Is Important for Cell Polarityand Migration The results presented above suggest that CXCR7 reduces the level of SDF-1a in the embryo allowing proper generation ofthe chemokine gradient. Detailed morphological analysis ofPGCs migrating within the CXCR7-depleted environment strongly supports this idea. Specically, in contrast with their morphology in wild-type embryos ( Figure 4 S2 ), PGCs in CXCR7 knocked-down embryos appear less polarized, such that protrusion formation is not focused atthe leading edge of the cell, but rather could be observed simul-taneously at two opposite sides of the cell ( Figure 4 A, lower panels, and Movie S3 ). Further evidence for the reduced polarity Figure 4. CXCR7 Controls PGC Polarity by Regulating (A) polarity of migrating germ cells. Wild-type PGCs show a typical polarization of the cells with protrusions at the leading edge in the direction of migration (upper panel, arrows). PGCs in CXCR7-depleted embryos exhibit reduced polarity with protrusions extended in opposite directions(lower panel, arrowheads). Cells labeled with EGFP-F.(B) CXCR7 depletion reduces the motility of PGCs in an SDF-1a-dependent manner. The motility of PGCs was followed in time-lapse movies. Error bars represent SEM. Examples for 70 min long migration paths of germ cells are shown. PGCs in CXCR7 morphants exhibit low motility with short tracks that are reminiscent of PGCs migrating in embryos with high-uniform SDF-1a expression in CXCR7-depleted embryos restores PGC motility to a levelthat is similar to that in SDF-1-depleted embryos. Similarly, knocking down CXCR4 restores PGC motility knockdown CXCR7 (leftpanel, 66.4% \u00b13% ectopic cells per embryo, n = 30 embryos) is suppressed by coinjection of low levels (0.02 SDF-1a-MO, CXCR7-MO and SDF-1a-MO, 36.0% \u00b12% ectopic cells per embryo, n = 63 embryos). Cell 132, 463-473, February 8, 2008 \u00aa2008 Elsevier Inc. 467of PGCs in CXCR7-depleted embryos was obtained by interfer- ing with calcium polarity in the cells. Expressing an activatedform of the STIM1 protein in PGCs elevates calcium levels in the rear of migrating cells and challenges their calcium polarity (Blaser et al., 2006 ). Whereas wild-type PGCs expressing mu- tated STIM1 are and migrate ( Movie S4 ) (Blaser et al., 2006 ), a similar manipulation in CXCR7 knocked- down embryos resulted in a dramatic loss of PGC morphologicalpolarity and motility ( Movie S5 ). We consider this nding a further indication for the reduced polarity of PGCs migrating in manipu- lated embryos. To validate the notion that the basis for the phenotype of CXCR7 knockdown lies with higher levels of SDF-1 in the envi-ronment, we examined PGC behavior in manipulated embryos. PGCs in CXCR7 knocked-down embryos exhibited strong inhibi-tion of motility manifested in short migration tracks ( Figure 4 B). This phenotype could be mimicked by global SDF-1a expressionin otherwise wild-type embryos ( Figure 4 B). A striking reversal of the CXCR7 knockdown phenotype was observed when CXCR7and both ligands (SDF-1a SDF-1b) were simultaneously knocked down; experimental cells exhibited motility similar to cells lacking the guidance cue ( Figure 4 B) (Doitsidou et al., 2002; Reichman-Fried et al., 2004 ). Suppression of the CXCR7 phenotype was similarly achieved by concomitant knockdownof CXCR4b ( Figure 4 B). Although PGCs in these experiments re- gained motility, they were nevertheless dispersed throughout the embryos (data not shown), since by knocking down CXCR4b or SDF-1 (along with CXCR7), the guidance signal was eliminated.We reasoned that a mild reduction in SDF-1a level might permitcell motility in embryos lacking CXCR7, while preserving thefunction of the chemokine as a guidance cue. In such a case,one would predict that treating CXCR7 morphants with low levels of sdf-1a morpholino should allow many PGCs to reach their target. Indeed, such a manipulation reduced the severity of the migration phenotype observed in 24 hpf embryos (Figure 4 C). To determine whether the effect of CXCR7 on SDF-1a distribu- tion is accompanied by signaling through the ligand-bound re- ceptor, we have tested the possible involvement of two key path- ways acting downstream of chemokine receptors, namely elevation in calcium levels and PI3K activation (e.g., Andrews et al., 2007; Blaser et al., Bleul et al., al., 1999; al., 1999 ). We found that CXCR7 knockdown had no effect on the level of calcium in somatic cells (Figure 5 A). In addition, in embryos in which PI3K activity was in- hibited using Wortmannin (as evident by membrane-to-cyto-plasm translocation of Akt-PH-EGFP), and migrated actively, unlike PGCs in CXCR7 knocked-down embryos, which exhibit defects in motility and cell polarity (Figure 5 B and Movies S6 and S7 ). Last, despite the apparently high-binding afnity CXCR7 to SDF-1 in the mammalian Balabanian et al., 2005 ), the zebrash CXCR7 for CXCR4b. Specically, preferential did not suppress the CXCR4b knockdown phe-notype ( Figure 5 C). Consistent with previous ndings ( Burns et al., 2006; Proost et al., 2007 ), our results support the idea that at least in the context of PGC migration in zebrash,CXCR7 is a silent receptor that does not signal.

Migration was monitored inCXCR7-depleted embryos and compared with the mi-gration of PGCs in embryos in which PI3K was in-hibited. In CXCR7-depleted embryos PGCs displaymultiple protrusions in opposing directions (upper panel, arrowheads), typical of CXCR7 inhibition. By contrast, PGCs treated with the selective PI3K inhibi-tor Wortmannin (25 mM) are polar and migrate with the protrusions, forming in the direction of migration(lower panel, arrowheads). Effective inhibition ofPI3K function was monitored by the localization ofAkt-PH-EGFP.

We found that the PGCs were preferentially located within domains lacking CXCR7, suggesting that the re- ceptor affected the local SDF-1a concentration, promotingPGC migration toward regions where higher levels of SDF-1a are present ( Figure 6 B). To visualize the dynamic response of the PGCs to cells expressing CXCR7, we have examined the ef- fect of CXCR7-expressing cells on the migration of PGCs toward an SDF-1a source ( Figures 6 C and 6D and Movies S10 and S11 ). PGCs rapidly and effectively migrated toward cells expressing the chemokine, while ignoring control cells transplanted on their way to the source ( Figures 6 C, upper panels, and 6D, left panel). In a striking contrast, transplantation of CXCR7-expressing cells (red cells in Figure 6 C) between the PGCs and the chemokine source (blue cells in Figure 6 C) dramatically affected the migra- tion path of the PGCs such that they rarely crossed the CXCR7expression eld ( Figures 6 C, lower panels, cells 2 and 3, white tracks; and 6D, right panel). Consistently, expression of high levels of CXCR7 in the germ cells themselves affected their mi- gration, presumably by reducing the effective level of SDF-1aaround the cells ( Figure S4 ). To examine the possibility that CXCR7 plays a similar role in other contexts in embryonic development, we investigated thepotential function for the gene in the nervous system, where it ex- hibits a dynamic expression pattern. At 12 hpf cxcr7 is most prominently expressed in two broad stripes close to the head- trunk border ( Figure 1 G). Interestingly, the posterior cxcr7 stripe overlaps with sdf-1a, while the anterior cxcr7 stripe shows a largely complementary pattern with respect to sdf-1a (Fig- ure 6 E, upper panel). To determine whether the distribution of SDF-1a is altered in a manner that is consistent with the expres- sion pattern of cxcr7 , we have examined the exact position of PGCs abnormally found in this location in spadetail mutants (Weidinger et al., 1999, 2002 ). This analysis revealed that PGCs were never found in a region where cxcr7 was expressed (Figure 6 E, lower panel). Accordingly, the cells usually ignored the broad sdf-1a mRNA expression that is partially overlapping with that of cxcr7 mRNA ( Figure 6 E, large brackets) and would settle in an sdf-1a- expressing clustering point away from the an- terior cxcr7 stripe ( Figure 6 E, small brackets). Together, the results presented in this section are in agree- ment with the notion that CXCR7 can shape the SDF-1a gradient, thereby affecting the migration path of PGCs within the embryo.As CXCR7 is expressed in a broad range of tissues, it could func- tion in controlling the distribution of SDF-1 in those locations, thereby regulating processes other than PGC migration. DISCUSSION During their migration, zebrash PGCs arrive at locations where sdf-1a RNA is expressed (e.g., Figure 2 G) (Blaser et al., 2005; Doitsidou et al., 2002; Reichman-Fried et al., 2004 ). Dynamic alterations in the expression pattern of sdf-1a are followed by a rapid migration response of germ cells to maintain their posi-tion in close proximity to tissues that express the RNA encoding the chemokine ( Figure 7 , left panels) ( Reichman-Fried et al., 2004 ). Two processes could account for the observed tight as- sociation of PGCs with sdf-1a -transcribing cells. First, the re- sponding cells could be capable of detecting minute differences in the level of the attractant and would therefore continuously migrate to remain within domains of sdf-1a transcription, where slightly higher levels of the secreted SDF-1a would be found. Inaddition to the sensitivity and effective response of PGCs to the signal, processes in the environment could cooperate by con- trolling the shape of the SDF-1a gradient. For example, continu-ous clearing of the ligand from somatic tissues would constitute a useful mechanism for achieving migration precision. In this study, we provide evidence consistent with the idea thatCXCR7 activity is essential for attaining a distribution of SDF- 1a that is capable of polarizing the PGCs and directing their mi- gration toward cells expressing the RNA of the attractant. Incontrast to CXCR4b, whose internalization regulates the signal-ing level of the receptor by removing it from the membrane ( Min- ina et al., 2007 ), CXCR7 regulates the signaling level of CXCR4b by reducing the level of SDF-1a in the extracellular environment.In the absence of CXCR7 activity, an increase in the absolute level of SDF-1a and a decrease in gradient steepness would thus interfere with proper directed migration despite the correctRNA expression pattern ( Figure 7 , right panels). Whereas anti- SDF-1a antibodies are currently not available, such a reagentwould provide interesting insights into the precise effect ofCXCR7 loss of function on the distribution of the chemoattrac- tant in the embryo. While the molecular details differ, a mechanism for controlling cell migration reminiscent to the one proposed here has been suggested to account for guidance of germ cell migration in Dro- sophila (Renault and Lehmann, 2006; Renault et al., 2004 ).Dro- sophila PGCs are thought to migrate along a gradient of lipid phosphate that acts as a chemoattractant. Analogous to se- questration of SDF-1a, dephosphorylation of the lipid phosphate in specic somatic tissues of the Drosophila embryo renders those regions repulsive, thereby directing the migration of the cells toward their target. The process in which zebrash PGCs effectively avoid do- mains where the attractive molecule ceases to be expressed is reminiscent of that observed in the resolution of inflammatory re- sponse. In this case, tissue homeostasis depends on migration of cells that were originally attracted to the site of an inflamma-tory stimulus, away from that location. Different mechanisms that promote clearing of the attractive signal were identied, and these allow efcient resolution and reduction of tissue dam-age (reviewed in Hansell Nibbs, Serhan and Savill, 2005 ). Of particular relevance for this study is the chemokine depletion without signaling that was proposed toaccount for the function of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 (D'Amico et al., 2000 ). In this case, it has been shown that IL- 10 maintains the expression of inflammatory chemokine recep- tors (CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5) on mature molecular sinks for the proinflammatory chemokines CCL3 and CCL5. The receptors on the DCs function exclusively in sequestering the chemokine, as they do not induce signalingor chemotaxis. Similarly, CCL3 and CCL5 clearing during the Cell 132, 463-473, February 8, 2008 \u00aa2008 Elsevier Inc. 469Figure 6.

As SDF-1 has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis and in acute lung injury inflammatory responses (e.g., De Klerck et al., 2005; Matthys et al., 2001; Nanki et al., 2000; Petty et al.,2007 ), it would be interesting to examine whether CXCR7 is in- volved in regulation of inflammation in these tissues. Further- more, since the SDF-1/CXCR4 pair is involved in other patholog- ical conditions (in particular cancer, e.g., Muller et al. [2001] and Orimo et al. [2005] ) and controls a wide range of developmental and homeostatic activities (e.g., Aiuti et al., 1997; Peled et al., 1999; Zou et al., 1998 ), examining the role of CXCR7 in these pro- cesses would be an important avenue for future research. Whereas our results provide strong evidence that CXCR7 is a nonsignaling receptor that functions as a sink for SDF-1a in the case of PGC migration, it could be that this molecule func-tions differently in different contexts. For example, the resultsofValentin et al. (2007) are compatible with the idea that in the case of the zebrash lateral-line primordium, CXCR7 activationplays an instructive role in dictating cell behavior in the posteriorpart of the migrating organ. The question of whether CXCR7 acts as a professional or a part-time decoy receptor would thus re- quire detailed examination of the biochemical and cellular re-sponses in different settings in which this receptor functions. Although this study reiterates the central role of SDF-1a and CXCR4b in guiding PGC migration, our results highlight the im-portance of regulation by other molecules. It would thereforebe important to examine additional parameters that could influ- ence SDF-1a function in vivo, especially those relevant for itsspread within the embryo. Exploring the role of components of the extracellular matrix that are known to bind SDF-1 as well as enzymes modifying SDF-1 in the extracellular environment would be especially informative in this context.

Consequently, germcells lose their close association with sdf-1a transcription domains. Cell 132, 463-473, February 8, 2008 \u00aa2008 Elsevier Inc. 47130UTR transgenics. CXCR7-depleted donor cells were transplanted into a con- trol morpholino-injected host or vice versa. Control experiments were per- formed by injecting control or CXCR7 morpholino into both donor and host em-bryos.

To check for SDF-1a presence in the treated medium, HEK293 cells were transfected with pCDNA3-CXCR4b-YPet, starved for 48 hr, and stimu- lated with SDF-1a conditioned media or depleted media at 37 /C14C for 30 min.

We here analyze two adjacent, dorsal epithelial cells, called pm8 and vpi1, that remodel encircle the mid-line by wrapping around nger-like projections from neighboring cells. Finally, pm8 and vpi1 self-fuse to become toroids by expressing AFF-1 EFF-1, twofusogens that are each sufcient to promote crossfu-sion between other cell types. Notch signaling inpm8 induces AFF-1 expression, while simultaneouslyrepressing EFF-1 expression; of Thus, the adjacent pm8 andvpi1 cells express different fusogens, allowing them to self-fuse into separate, single-cell tubes while avoiding crossfusion. INTRODUCTION Epithelia formation is fundamental to the development of all animals. Epithelial cells are polarized, with basolateral domains separated from apical domains by adherens junctions. The ad-herens junctions contain E-cadherin and other proteins that me- diate cell adhesion, and the basal surface typically is associated with a basal lamina. Despite the organization and cohesion of ep-ithelial cells, epithelia can be extensively remodeled in response to developmental signals. Planar epithelia can be remodeled into tubes, and epithelial tubes can develop branches ( Lubarsky and Krasnow, 2003 ). Although oriented cell division or apoptosis can contribute to remodeling ( Gong et al., 2004; Schreiber et al., 2005 ), in many cases remodeling involves nondividing cells that change shape or position. For example, the elaboratelybranched tracheal tubes of Drosophila begin as sacs of epithelial cells that intercalate and change shape without dividing (Casa-nova, 2007 ). Epithelia can dissociate during epithelial to mesen-chymal and Sleeman, 2006 ), or undergo tran- sient restructuring to allow the passage of migrating cells. Examples of transepithelial migration include Drosophila germ cells that migrate through the posterior midgut epithelium to form the gonad ( Kunwar et al., 2006 ), and the passage of human leukocytes through the epithelial lining of blood vessels to reachsites of infection (Petri and Bixel, 2006 ). These events demon- strate the remarkable ability of epithelial cells to change shapes by altering their adhesiveness. TheC. elegans pharynx provides an attractive model system for analyzing molecular mechanisms of epithelial remodeling during organogenesis. The pharynx is essentially a monolayered myoepithelial tube whose anatomy, specication, and gene ex- pression have been compared to the heart of higher animals.For example, the ascidian heart is a simple tube, consisting of a monolayer of myoepithelial cells ( Oliphant function and vertebrate heart respectively, rescue C. mutants lacking al., 1997; Haun al.,1998 ). In addition to muscle cells, the pharynx contains glands, neurons, and structural cells called marginal cells. An ultrastruc-tural reconstruction of the adult pharynx showed these individualcells have remarkably complex and reproducible shapes ( Albert- son and Thomson, 1976 ). Along the longitudinal axis of the phar- ynx, muscles and marginal cells are organized into distinct ante-rior/posterior groups based on region-specic morphologies. For example, the most anterior muscle is shaped like a fenes- trated cylinder with openings that are nearly as large as thecell, while the most posterior muscle is a toroid. The pharynx is linked to the intestine through valve cells, the rst of which is also a toroid. Nearly all of the complex changes in pharyngeal cell shape be- gin within a cylindrical cyst of initially uniform, simple epithelial cells ( Leung et al., 1999; Portereiko and Mango, 2001 ). During early embryogenesis, cells from two separate lineages aggre- gate to form a primordium that forms the pharynx and valve (reviewed in Mango, 2007 ). In both lineages, the key step in specifying pharyngeal/valve fate is the expression of pha-4,a n organ selector gene that encodes a forkhead box transcriptionfactor. PHA-4 is expressed in all pharyngeal and valve cells, and is necessary and sufcient for most early embryonic cellsto adopt pharyngeal fates ( Horner et al., 1998; et al., Developmental Cell 14, 559-569, April 2008 \u00aa2008 Elsevier Inc. 5591998; Mango et al., 1994 ). Midway through embryogenesis, cells in the primordium polarize to form an epithelial cyst that is pri- marily one cell in thickness ( Leung et al., 1999 ). In cross-sections of the cyst, most cells have a simple, wedge-shaped appear- ance: each cell has a narrow apical tip facing the midline of the cyst, and a broad basal surface associated with a basal lamina. A complex remodeling of the cyst occurs over the next few hours of embryogenesis ( Leung et al., 1999; Mango, 2007 ). cyst is transformed into a bilobed tubular pharynxthat contains a wide diversity of cell shapes and that is parti- tioned from the adjacent valve cells by a basal lamina. To under-stand how cell shapes are determined within the cyst, we ana- lyzed here the development of two toroidal, single-cell tubes called pm8 and vpi1. We show that morphogenesis involvesNotch signaling, epithelial to mesenchymal transitions, migration through neighboring cells on a transient tract of laminin, and self-fusion. These results reveal numerous interactions thatcontribute to the nal shapes of the cells. RESULTSBackground The pharynx is a bilobed myoepithelial tube containing pharyn- geal muscles (pm), structural cells called marginal cells (mc), gland cells, and neurons ( Figure 1 A; see Mango, 2007 for de- scription of pharyngeal anatomy and development). The pharynx connects to the intestine through a multicellular valve (vpi cells forvalve pharynx/ intestine). The events analyzed here occur in the posterior lobe of the pharynx, called the terminal bulb, andin the adjacent valve cells. Most cells in the pharynx are arranged with 3-fold radial symmetry around the lumenal axis ( Figure 1 A andMovie S1 , see the Supplemental Data available with this ar- ticle online). Muscles, marginal cells, and valve cells show ante-rior/posterior differences in cell morphology, creating distinctive groups of one to six cells (groups pm1-8, mc1-3, vpi1-3; Albert- son and Thomson, 1976 ). For example, mc3V is the ventral cell of the three group 3 marginal cells ( Figure 1 A). Although multiple cells surround the lumen of the pharynx/valve in a typicalcross-section, there are two examples of single-cell tubes: pm8, the terminal cell in the pharynx, and vpi1, the rst cell in the valve ( Figures 1 A-1C). Our analysis of pm8 and vpi1 morpho- genesis begins at about 6.5 hr after the two-cell stage of embryo-genesis, when the primordium of the pharynx/valve is a cylindri- cal cyst of polarized epithelial cells ( Figures 1 B and 1D). The apical surfaces of these cells face the midline of the cyst, where the pharyngeal/valve lumen forms, and are outlined by junctional proteins such as AJM-1 ( Figures 1 D and 1E). The basal surfaces of these cells face the periphery of the cyst and are associated with a basal lamina that contains laminin ( Figure 1 D). Notch Signaling Regulates Gene Expression in pm8Several genes have been described that are expressed in multi-ple or all pharyngeal and valve cells, however, the ceh-24 gene is expressed uniquely in pm8 ( Harfe and Fire, 1998 ). CEH-24 is an NK transcription factor related to CEH-22 (see Introduction ), and previous studies identied a 117 bp enhancer from ceh-24 that promotes pm8-specic expression ( Harfe and Fire, 1998 ). We noticed that this enhancer contained a conserved GTGGGAA se-quence that is a predicted binding site for LAG-1/CSL, the coreDNA-binding protein in the Notch signaling pathway ( Figure S1 A; see Greenwald, 2005 and Bray, 2006 for reviews on Notch). We found that LAG-1/CSL bound the wild-type enhancer in vitro,and that binding was dependent on the GTGGGAA sequence (Figure S1 B). Transgenic ceh-24 ::GFP reporters constructed with either the wild-type enhancer sequence, or with a GTG- GGAA to GAGGCAA mutation, were expressed in head neuronsoutside the pharynx, but only the wild-type enhancer drove ro- bust expression in pm8 ( Figure 2 C and Figure S1 D;Table 1 ). Ex- pression was dependent on Notch activity, as lin-12 glp-1 double mutants that lack both of the C. elegans Notch proteins, LIN-12 and GLP-1, either did not express ceh-24 ::GFP (18/20 embryos) Figure 1.

REF-1 is a C. elegans bHLH factor that is distantly related to Alper and Priess, 2005 ). The ref-1 gene is a direct target of Notch signaling in several interactions in the early embryo, but is expressed in other cells independent of Notch ( Neves and Priess, 2005 ). In the wild-type epithelial cyst, we found that ref-1::GFP was ex- pressed in pm8 and in the sister cells e2V and mc3V ( Figure 2 I and data not shown). lin-12 glp-1 double mutants showed expression in e2V and mc3V, but not in pm8 ( Figure 2 J;Table 1). Additional experiments showed that pm8 expression requiredLAG-1/CSL, and appeared to involve either of the Notch ligands LAG-2/Delta or APX-1/Delta ( Table 1 and see myo-2 gene encodes a pharyngeal-specic myosin; the myo-2 promoter lacks predicted LAG-1/CSL binding sites, and thus is unlikely to be a direct target of Notch signaling (data Figure 2.

Nuclei labeled ''n'' in (C) and (D) are neurons out-side the pharynx that express ceh-24 ::GFP. Bars = 5 mm (A-F), and 10 mm (G-J). Embryos are approximately 50 mm in length.Table 1.

For example, 9/93 myo-2 ::GFP-expressing nuclei in lin-12(n941)glp- 1(q46) were in the valve adjacent to the pharynx. bExpression was weak and in two cases a comparable signal was observed in vpi1. clag-2(q387) is a small deciency that deletes both lag-1 andapx-1 , but removes several additional genes. dThis reporter lacks all eight CSL sites ( Neves and Priess, 2005). eThese animals showed a strong correlation between myo-2 ::GFP expression and whether or not the pm8 nucleus was in the ventral side of the terminal bulb; 38/57 of expressing less than in lag-1 mutants. Additional experiments ruled out the possibility that the candidate pm8 muscle was a different cell that normally un- dergoes apoptosis (see analysis in Figure S2 ). lin-12 and/or glp-1 might contribute to the pheno- type. However, the phenotype of the double mutant was not enhanced bylin-12(RNAi) , and it is not possible to remove maternal glp-1 without severely disrupting embryogenesis (data not shown; Priess, 2005). gBecause this reporter transgene is not integrated into a chromosome, and can be lost spontaneously, only those animals with expression inthe pm3 and pm5 muscle groups of the pharynx were scored for pm8expression. hThe single positive animal had expression throughout the valve.Developmental Cell Single-Cell Tubulogenesis in C. elegans Developmental Cell 14, 559-569, April 2008 \u00aa2008 Elsevier Inc. 561not shown). We generated an integrated transgenic strain ex- pressing a nuclear-localized myo-2 ::GFP reporter (J. Gaudet, unpublished data), and found that wild-type larvae reproduciblyshowed expression in each of the expected 13 muscle nuclei inthe terminal bulb (6 pm5 + 3 pm6 + 3 pm7 + 1 pm8; Figure 2 E; Table 1 ). Notch mutant larvae had defects in pm8 myogenesis (Figure 2 F and Figure S2 B); for example, 97% of lag-1 mutant lar- vae only 12 myo-2 ::GFP-expressing cells in the terminal bulb, and specically lacked expression at the normal position of pm8 ( Table 1 ). We conclude that Notch signaling in- duces the expression of a least two transcription factors in pm8, CEH-24 and REF-1, and is required for pm8 myogenesis. Mutants Are Defective in Both pm8 and vpi1 Morphogenesislag-1 mutant larvae usually lacked a nucleus in the normal posi- tion of the pm8 nucleus, suggesting that Notch mutants havea defect in pm8 morphogenesis that is at least partially separatefrom the myogenesis defect. We used light and electron micros-copy to compare the pharynx and valve in newly hatched, wild- type larvae with Notch mutant larvae. In newly hatched, wild- type larvae, the rst valve cell (vpi1) forms a cup-like enclosureover the posterior end of pm8 ( Figures S3 and S3C); in live an- imals, pm8 and vpi1 appear tightly adherent and show no visibleseparation during body locomotion (unpublished data). pm8 andvpi1 make a small direct contact near their apical surfaces, but are otherwise separated by a prominent basal lamina that almost completely separates the pharynx from the valve ( Figure S3 C). In Notch mutant larvae, cells at the pharynx/valve interface hadseveral morphological defects including large gaps between cells (arrow in Figure 2 B), broad contacts between pharyngeal cells and valve cells without an intervening basal lamina (Figure S3 B and data not shown), and abnormal patterns of api- cal junctions (see Figures 4 H and 4I). We were unable to identify cells with the normal morphology of pm8 or vpi1 in the mutantlarvae, although other cells such as the pm6 and pm7 muscles appeared well differentiated (n = 12; Figure S3 B). Thus, these re- sults suggest the Notch pathway has a role in the differentiation or morphogenesis of pm8, vpi1, and possibly other valve cells. Notch Is Activated in the Postmitotic pm8 Cell To determine when and where Notch interactions occurred, we rst sought to identify the relevant ligand-expressing cellsthrough laser-killing experiments. We found that descendants of the embryonic cell MSaapa that were not previously known to function in Notch signaling expressed the ligand LAG-2/Delta(Figure 3 A) and were required for Notch-dependent ref-1::GFP expression in pm8 ( Figure 3 B). In immunostaining experiments, the rst apparent contact between MSaapa descendants ex-pressing lag-2 ::GFP and cells that express the receptor LIN- 12/Notch occurred after the birth of pm8, approximately 6 hr af-ter the two-cell stage. A clone of four LIN-12-expressing cells islocated in the left dorsal quadrant of the epithelial cyst; the mostposterior cell in this group is pm8 ( Figures 3 C and 3D). At this stage, vpi1 is in the right dorsal quadrant of the cyst and doesnot express detectable levels of LIN-12; the receptor GLP-1/Notch was not detectable in vpi1 or pm8 ( Figure 3 C and data not shown). MSaapa descendants within the cyst expressLAG-2/Delta, and one or two of these cells contact pm8 directly(Figure 3 C). Lateral views of embryos at approximately the same stage showed Notch-independent expression of ref-1 ::GFP in the pharyngeal cells mc3V, but no other pharyngeal or valvecells ( Figure 3 D 0). However, pm8 showed strong ref-1 ::GFP expression about 30 min later ( Figure 3 E0). These results suggest that Notch signaling is activated in the postmitotic pm8 cell, butnot in vpi1 or any other valve cell, and that Notch thus has an in-direct role in valve differentiation or morphogenesis. pm8 and vpi1 subsequentstages, we used the ref-1 promoter to drive plasma ref-1::GFP-PM). pm8 the dorsal, left side ofthe cyst, and has a broad, midline-facing apical surface similar to other cyst cells (Figures 1E and 3D). Shortly thereafter, pm8 nearly from the dorsal basal lamina, and its apical sur- face is remodeled a lamella that invades the ventral side ofthe cyst (Figures 3E,4A, and 4B; data not shown). Both the pm8 nucleus and bulk cytoplasm cross into the ventral side,leaving only a thin connection to the dorsal perimeter of thecyst ( Figures 4 A-4D). pm8 invades the ventral side of the cyst to the left of the midline, but gradually spreads across the entirecross section of the cyst ( Figure 4 F and Movie S1 ). vpi1 morphogenesis was examined by electron microscopy and of eff-1 ::EFF-1::GFP (see below). Similar to pm8, vpi1 initially is a wedge-shaped dorsal cell that extends alamellar process into the ventral side of the cyst; the vpi1 lamellais closely associated with the posterior surface of the migrating pm8 cell body ( Figure 4 E and Figure S3 D). In contrast to pm8, the nucleus and bulk cytoplasm of vpi1 remain on the dorsal side of the cyst. Both pm8 and vpi1 appear to redistribute cytoplasm throughout their respective cell bodies during late embryogenesis, becoming symmetrical tubes centered on themidline of the cyst ( Figure 1 C, inset, and data not shown). pm8 and vpi1 Migrate within the Cyst on a TransientPath of LamininIn all embryos analyzed, pm8 and vpi1 migrated into the ventralside of the cyst specically at the lateral interface between the ventral cells mc3V and vpi2V (see Figure 1 B). In some examples of transepithelial migration in other systems, cells in the target ep- ithelium disassociate prior to the arrival of migrating cells, thus creating openings for migration ( Kunwar et al., 2006 ). Electron mi- crographs of the epithelial cyst before or during pm8 migration did not show obvious gaps between any ventral cells (data not shown). A second possibility is that the mc3V/vpi2V interface provides a guidance cue for pm8 migration. Consistent with thishypothesis, we found that a transient tract of laminin appears in the ventral cyst shortly before pm8 migration ( Figures 5 A and 5D), and disappears after pm8 migration ( Figure 5 E). Heterotri- meric laminin in C. elegans is composed of two achains (EPI-1 and LAM-3), a bchain (LAM-1), 2005 ). An antiserum specic for LAM-3 stained the tract in wild-type embryos, but not in lam-3 mutant embryos (data not shown). In time-lapse movies of lam-1 ::LAM-1::GFP, the laminin tract appeared to spread inward from the ventral perimeter of the cyst over a 20 min interval ( Movie S2 ) before regressing. In laterDevelopmental Cell Single-Cell Tubulogenesis in C. elegans 562 Developmental Cell 14, 559-569, April 2008 \u00aa2008 Elsevier Inc.embryogenesis, a different and permanent zone of laminin appears along the posterior surface of pm8 that is part of the basallamina between pm8 and vpi1 ( Figure 5 F and Figure S3 C). Using ref-1 ::GFP to identify both mc3V and pm8, we found that the transient laminin tract appeared specically at the mc3V/vpi2Vinterface, and that the tract disappeared concomitant with theventral migration of pm8 ( Figures 5 G-5I). The laminin tract was mc3V/vpi2V interface lin-12 glp-1 mutants, indi- cating that it is specied independent signaling. Indeed,the tract persisted in 7.5 hr-old lin-12 glp-1 mutant embryos (Figure 5 B) long after it disappears from wild-type embryos (Figure 5 E).An antiserum against EPI-1 stained the tract, indicating that it contains both laminin achains, LAM-3 and EPI-1. We found that lam-3 and epi-1 single mutants appeared to have normal pm8 migration (data not shown). However, pm8 was unable tomigrate ventrally in lam-3; epi-1 double mutants, and instead remained primarily on the dorsal side of the cyst ( Figure 5 J). Cell migration on laminin surfaces can involve the major laminin receptor, integrin. In C. elegans ,ina-1 is one of two genes ing the heterodimeric integrin, sole bsubunit ( Kramer, 2005 ).pat-3(RNAi) embryos had severe developmental defects that complicated an analysis of pm8 migration. However, most ina-1 mutants were able to Figure 3. Notch Signaling in the Epithelial Cyst (A-A0) Ventral view of an embryo before formation of the cyst showing lag-2 expression in MSaapa.

We found that mutants showed severe defects in pm8 migra- tion ( Figure 5 K). In many larvae, pm8 appeared to have migrated abnormally into the region normally occupied by valve cells andanterior intestinal cells ( Figure 5 K). The pm8 cell body was closely apposed to the basal lamina surrounding the valve and intestine,suggesting that pm8 might extend along basal laminae associ-ated with these surfaces rather than the normal mc3V/vpi2Vinterface. Tubulogenesis and Self-Fusion A single-cell tube such as pm8 or vpi1 might, in principle, be ei-ther a toroid or a C-shaped cell. The apical surfaces of both types of tubes have circular intercellular junctions at each end of the cell, but only the C-shaped cell has an autocellular apical junc-tion ( Figure 6 A). pm8 and vpi1 have been shown to be toroids, rather than C-shaped cells, in adult C. elegans (Albertson and Thomson, 1976 ). We found that in 7.5 hr embryos pm8 and vpi1 had the apical junction pattern expected for toroidal cells (two unconnected circles; Figure 6 B), and conrmed by electron microscopy that both cells are toroids ( Figure S4 ). Although an epithelial cell can roll up into a C-shape, a toroid has a distincttopology that requires at least one self-fusion event. C. elegans development provides multiple examples where adjacent cells fuse together into a multinucleate syncytium, and most of thesefusions require the eff-1 Mohler et al., 2002 EFF-1 acts fusion; it is sufcient fusionof heterologous cells that each express EFF-1 ( Podbilewicz et al., 2006 ). Recent studies in C. elegans have identied a sec- ond fusogen, AFF-1, with a similar ability to fuse heterologouscells ( Sapir et al., 2007 ). We found that eff-1 ::EFF-1::GFP was ex- pressed at high levels in vpi1 beginning at about 7 hr ( Figure 6 B 0), but was never expressed in pm8. In 7.5 hr eff-1 mutant embryos, vpi1 had a novel, autocellular junction as characteristic ofa C-shaped cell, while pm8 retained the wild-type, toroidal pat-tern 6 aff-1 ::GFP was expressed in the wild-type pm8 beginning at about 7.2 hr, but was never expressed in vpi1 ( Figure 6 C 0). In 7.5 hr aff-1 mutant embryos, pm8 had a novel autocellular junc- wild-type, intercel-lular junctions ( Figure 6 B, inset). These results suggest that in normal development both pm8 and vpi1 adopt C-shapes before self-fusing through AFF-1 and EFF-1 activities, respectively. Because cells in the approximate positions of pm8 and vpi1 have highly abnormal patterns of apical junctions in Notchmutants, we examined EFF-1 expression in these embryos. Al- though eff-1 ::EFF-1::GFP is expressed only in vpi1 in wild-type embryos, in lag-1 mutant embryos the reporter was expressed in two adjacent cells at this position ( Figures 6 D and 6E), or in a single, abnormally large binucleate cell ( Figure 6 F). We identi- ed one of the cells that expressed eff-1 ::EFF-1::GFP as pm8 based on its contact with group 7 muscle cells (data not shown). Conversely, neither pm8 nor vpi1 expressed aff-1 ::GFP in lag-1 mutants ( Table 1 ). We conclude that Notch has two roles in pm8 and vpi1 tubulogenesis. First, Notch is required for pm8 toexpress AFF-1, allowing pm8 to self-fuse. Second, Notch is Figure 4.

Three group 3 marginal cells are immediately anterior to pm8 during pm8 and vpi1 morphogenesis, and one of ex-presses same ::GFP-PM reporter as pm8 1A and 3E 0). In analyzing pm8 morphogenesis, we discovered that all three marginal cells extend a nger-like process posteri-orly along the midline of the 4 4F, Figure S4 A, and Movie S3 ). Thus, as the pm8 cell body moves into the left ventral side ofthe cyst, then spreads across the entire cross-section of thecyst, it wraps around the three marginal cell ngers ( Movie S4 ). The ngers appeared to stop at, or extend slightly beyond, theposterior surface of pm8, where they would presumably contactthe thin, ventral lamella from vpi1 showed ment of lamentous actin at the midline during formation of its lumen that was not apparent in pm8 ( Figure 4 E). Previous studies have shown that the pharyngeal lumen begins as small opening along the midline of the epithelial cyst; as the lumen expands it acquires a Y-shape when viewed in cross-section ( Leung et al., 1999 ). The three marginal cell ngers remained in the center of pm8 during lumenal expansion, moving apart to occupy the three tips of the Y-shaped lumen ( Figure 4 F). The marginal cell ngers formed apical junction connections with the apical face of pm8, but not vpi1, and persisted in the pm8 cell body throughout larval development. Thus, while the cylindrical apical surface of pm8 initially has only two circular intercellular junctions ( Figure 6 B), in late embryos and larvae there are an additional three paired lines of junctional material across this surface that correspond to the three ngers ( Figure 4 G and 4H). An intriguing possibility is that the marginal cells ngers template the lumenal channelthrough pm8, and vpi1 remodel their apical surfaces. However, we have not yet been able to test this hypothesis by removing all three marginal cells simultaneously;pm8 formed an abnormally shaped lumen when only mc3V was killed with a laser microbeam (2/2 embryos), or when the fate of mc3V was transformed by the glp-1(e2072) mutation (3/3 em- bryos examined by electron microscopy; see Priess et al., 1987 ). DISCUSSION Establishment of the Pharynx/Valve Boundary We here analyzed the morphogenesis of pm8 and vpi1, two ad- jacent, single-cell tubes 5. pm8 Migrates Ventrally on a Laminin Tract (A) Optical longitudinal section through the middle of a 7 hr embryo stained for laminin.

The morphogenetic events that de- ne the pm8/vpi1 boundary compartmentalize the cyst into the functionally distinct organs of the pharynx and valve. Cellsthroughout the epithelial cyst initially have radially oriented api- cobasal axes, and most cells retain this polarity after morpho- genesis. For example, pharyngeal muscles have single sarco-meres, and in most of these muscles the myolaments areoriented radially, extending from the pharyngeal lumen basal lamina. In contrast, the apicobasal axes of are reoriented during morphogenesis. The basal sur-faces of pm8 and vpi1 shift to face each other, and presumably form the basal lamina that nearly separates the two cells. This shift in polarity allows pm8 to have obliquely oriented myola-ments; similar myolaments occur at the terminus of the pharynx in diverse groups of nematodes and are believed to function in moving foodstuffs during feeding ( Doncaster, 1962; Mapes, 1965 ). We speculate that it is advantageous for pm8 and vpi1 to be toroids, rather than simply C-shaped cells, because toroids present a symmetrical pm8/vpi1 interface for cell attachment and basal lamina deposition (see Figure 6 A). Formation of a toroid requires at least one fusion event; thus, pm8 and vpi1 must self-fuse, vpi1 self-fuse by expressing different fusogens, anelegant solution to the problem of creating linked, single-cell tubes. vpi1 expresses a fusogen, EFF-1, that is sufcient fuse heterologous cells that each express EFF-1 ( Podbilewicz et al., 2006 ). We have shown that in eff-1 mutants vpi1 is a C-shaped cell with an autocellular indicating that EFF-1normally promotes the self-fusion of vpi1. pm8 does not expressEFF-1, instead expresses a second fusogen, AFF-1, and re-quires aff-1 activity to become and EFF-1 cause self-fusion in pm8 and vpi1, in addition to promotingcrossfusion between other types of embryonic cells. Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition pm8 and vpi1 are wedge-shaped, dorsal epithelial cells prior to becoming C-shaped cells and self-fusing. To form a C-shape around the cyst midline, both pm8 and vpi1 invade cellsin the ventral side of the cyst. Although vpi1 extends only a lamel-lar process through ventral cells, the nucleus and most of the pm8 cell body enter the ventral side. Notch activity appears to be involved in pm8 delamination from the dorsal basal lamina;pm8 normally detaches from the dorsal perimeter at about the same time as Notch target genes are expressed in pm8, but does not appear to detach in Notch mutant embryos. The delam-ination and migration of pm8 can be considered an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In most animals, EMT is a funda- mental and widely used morphogenetic program that functionsin gastrulation, and tissue and organ development. EMT also oc- curs in pathological states during wound healing and in tumor progression ( Thiery and Sleeman, 2006 ). A well-documented role for EMT occurs in the development of the vertebrate heart(Eisenberg and Markwald, 1995 ). Within the primitive heart tube, epithelial (endocardial) cells that contribute to valve devel-opment and heart septation break adherens connections to theirneighbors and invade the surrounding extracellular matrix (car- diac jelly). Notch signaling occurs within the endocardium and is critical for EMT ( Timmerman et al., 2004 ). In contrast to Figure 6.

For example, most gastru- lating cells in C. elegans are not epithelial, and lineage mecha- nisms ensure that most cells are born in their appropriate posi- tions without extensive tissue remodeling ( Nance et al., 2005 ). Because many basic processes in EMT are poorly understood,such as the restructuring of junctional complexes between cells,pm8 morphogenesis should prove a useful model system for ge-netic analysis. Laminin and Intraepithelial Cell Movements The migration of pm8 and vpi1 between cells in the ventral epi-thelium of the cyst resembles transepithelial migration in other systems, such as human leukocytes and Drosophila germ cells (see Introduction ). In all three systems, migration occurs be- tween cells in the target epithelium. These events occur rapidly,requiring about 15 min for pm8 migration and from 5-16 min in some in vitro models of leukocyte invasion ( Shaw et al., 2001 ). InDrosophila , the target epithelium appears primed for invasion; apical junctions are remodeled to create intercellular gaps even in the absence of the invading germ cells ( Kunwar et al., 2006 ). In contrast, invading leukocytes can induce junctional remodeling of the target epithelium (Shaw et al., 2001 ). In our present study, we found (1) that a tract of laminin appears between the ventralcells mc3V and vpi2V prior to pm8 and vpi1 migration, thatpm8 and vpi1 migration occurs specically at the mc3V/vpi2V in- terface, and is associated with a disappearance of the laminin tract, and (3) that laminin function is essential for pm8 migration(vpi1 was not examined in this experiment). These results sug-gest that laminin provides a transient path for pm8 migration. We do not yet know whether the formation of the laminin tract is induced by signals from pm8 and/or vpi1, however, the tractforms independent of Notch. Future genetic studies should re- veal the laminin receptor(s) involved in pm8 migration. If integrin were the sole receptor for laminin in pm8 migration, we wouldhave expected a lack of migration in integrin mutants, rather than the overmigration, or aberrant migration observed. Interest- ingly, neurons in a6 show an Georges-Labouesse et al., 1998 ). Although laminin is often implicated in animal cell migration, we know ofno similar example of a transient laminin tract guiding migratingcells through a polarized epithelium. The tract in C. elegans forms and disappears within about 30 min, so it is possible sim- ilar, transient tracts might have been overlooked in epithelia in other systems. Indeed, we observed additional examples oflaminin within C. elegans tissues that are not known to contain migratory cells (unpublished data). Thus, it will be interesting todetermine whether laminin-dependent, short-range cell move-ments similar to those of pm8 and vpi1 are a common feature of epithelial remodeling. Lumen Formation in a Single-Cell Tube Single-cell tubes are found in diverse animal tissues, includingthe ne capillaries of the vertebrate vascular system, the termini of the Drosophila tracheal C. (renal) system ( Lubarsky and Krasnow, 2003 ). Some of these tubes, such as the fusion cells of the Drosophila tracheal system, are toroids like the C. elegans cells ( et al., 1996 The lumen in some single-cell tubes is Kamei et al., 2006 ). In our electron microscopic study, we did not nd obvious cyto- plasmic vacuoles in pm8 or vpi1 before or immediately after lu-men formation (see Figure S3 D). pm8 migrates into the ventral side of the epithelial cyst on the left side of the midline, and thepm8 cell body subsequently spreads across the diameter ofthe cyst. During these events, the three group 3 marginal cellsextend ngers posteriorly along the midline. Thus, pm8 must ac- tively or passively wrap around the ngers at the midline. An in- triguing possibility is that the ngers play a morphogenetic role intemplating the lumenal surface of pm8. However, we have not been able to test this hypothesis by removing all three of the mar- ginal cells simultaneously. If the ngers do not play a direct role intemplating the lumen, it is possible they have a mechanical func- tion in holding cyst cells together while pm8 and vpi1 remodel their apical junctions. Notch Signaling and Tubulogenesis The Notch pathway is required for proper pm8 and vpi1 tubulo-genesis, and appears to have two distinct roles. First, Notch is re- quired for pm8 to express the fusogen AFF-1. Although the pre- sumptive ligand-expressing cells in the cyst appear to contactboth pm8 and vpi1 (see Figure 3 C), only pm8 expresses LIN-12/ Notch, and only pm8 expresses the Notch targets ceh-24 and ref-1 . These results suggest that the Notch pathway is activated only in pm8, and that defects in vpi1 morphogenesis in Notch mu-tants occur indirectly. Second, we have shown that expression of the EFF-1 fusogen is normally restricted to vpi1, but that pm8 and vpi1 both express EFF-1 in Notch mutants and can crossfuse.Crossfusion would prevent a basal lamina from forming between pm8 and vpi1, and thus account for the inappropriate, broad cel- lular contacts observed between pharyngeal and valve cells inNotch mutant embryos. Future studies should elucidate the tran- scriptional network linking Notch targets with fusogen expression and myogenesis. The regulatory regions of both aff-1 and eff-1 contain candidate LAG-1/CSL binding sites (unpublished data), however, we do not yet know whether either gene is a direct target of Notch. pm8 does not appear to express FOS-1A, a transcrip-tion factor that regulates aff-1 expression in a larval cell called the anchor cell ( Sapir et al., 2007 , and unpublished data). We conclude by noting that cells acquire several distinct and reproducible morphologies during the differentiation of thepharynx/valve from an epithelial cyst. The remarkable number of events underlying the development of just two of these cells, pm8 and vpi1, hint at the complexity of organ differentiation. Be-cause only a few postmitotic cells in the cyst express the recep- tors LIN-12/Notch or GLP-1/Notch, it appears that Notch does not play a major role in the morphogenesis of most other cystcells. Thus, it is likely that there are several different pathwaysthat specify cell shapes throughout the cyst, and it should be interesting in future studies to identify these pathways and determine how they are coordinated.

Yet the mechanisms that restrict thedevelopmental potential of transit amplifying cells are poorly understood. Here we show that the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor dFezf/Earmuff (Erm) functions cell-autonomously to main-tain the restricted developmental potential of theintermediate neural progenitors generated by typeII neuroblasts in Drosophila larval brains. Although erm mutant intermediate neural progenitors are correctly specied and show normal apical-basal cortical polarity, they can dedifferentiate back into a neuroblast state, functionally indistinguishablefrom normal type II neuroblasts. Erm restricts thepotential of intermediate neural progenitors by acti-vating Prospero to limit proliferation and by antago-nizing Notch signaling to prevent dedifferentiation.We conclude that Erm dependence functionallydistinguishes intermediate neural progenitors from neuroblasts in the Drosophila larval brain, balancing neurogenesis with stem cell maintenance. INTRODUCTION Tissue development and homeostasis often require stem cells to transiently expand the progenitor pool by producing transit amplifying cells. Yet the developmental potential of transit ampli-fying cells must be tightly restricted to ensure generation of differentiated progeny and to prevent unrestrained proliferation that might lead to tumorigenesis ( Morrison and Kimble, 2006; Pontious al., 2006 ). Transit amplifying cells are dened by their limited developmental capacity, a feature specied during fate determination ( Farkas et al., 2008; Hodge et al., 2008; Sessa et al., 2008 ). It is unknown whether an active mechanism is required to maintain restricteddevelopmental potential in transit amplifying cells after speci- cation. use intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) indeveloping larval brains as a genetic model to inves- tigate how restricted developmental potential is regulated intransit amplifying cells. A fly larval brain hemisphere contains eight type II neuroblasts that undergo repeated asymmetric divisions to self-renew and togenerate immature INPs ( Figure 1 A) (Bello et al., 2008; Boone and Doe, 2008; Bowman et al., 2008 ). Immature INPs are unstable in nature and are mitotically inactive, and lackthe expression S1 A). Immature INPs commit to the INP fate through maturation, a differentiation process necessary for specicationof the INP identity ( Figure 1 A). INPs express Dpn and Ase, and undergo 8-10 rounds of asymmetric divisions to self-renewand to produce ganglion mother cells (GMCs) that typically generate two neurons ( Figure S1 A) (Bello et al., 2008; Boone and Doe, 2008; Bowman et al., 2008 ). While 5-6 immature INPs and 1-2 young INPs are always in direct contact with theirparental neuroblasts, the older INPs become progressively dis- placed from their parental neuroblasts over time ( Bowman et al., 2008 ). During asymmetric divisions of type II neuroblasts, the basal proteins Brain tumor and Numb are exclusively segregated intoimmature INPs, and function cooperatively, but nonredun-dantly, to ensure that immature INPs undergo maturation and commit to the INP fate ( Boone and Doe, 2008; Bowman et al., 2008 ).brain tumor ornumb mutant type II neuroblasts generate immature INPs that fail to mature and do not committo the INP fate. Instead, brain tumor ornumb mutant immature INPs adopt their parental neuroblast fate, leading to supernu- merary type II neuroblasts. Thus, brain tumor andnumb specify the INP fate, and the ectopic expansion of type II neuroblasts inthese mutant genetic backgrounds occurs due to failure toproperly specify the INP fate. Although Brain tumor is also asymmetrically segregated into GMCs during asymmetric divi- sions of INPs, the mosaic clones in brain tumor mutant INPs contain only differentiated neurons ( Bowman et al., 2008 ). This result indicates that Brain tumor is dispensable for main- taining the restricted developmental potential of INPs. How restricted developmental potential is maintained in INPs iscurrently unknown. To identify genes that regulate self-renewal of neuroblasts, we conducted a genetic screen for mutants exhibiting ectopic larvalbrain neuroblasts (C.-Y.L. One l(2)5138 , specically resulted in massive expansion of neuroblasts in the brain but did not affect neuroblasts on the 126 Developmental Cell 18, 126-135, January 19, 2010 \u00aa2010 Elsevier Inc.ventral nerve cord ( Figures S1 B-S1D). We mapped the l(2)5138 mutation to the 22B4-7 chromosomal interval that contains the earmuff (erm) gene ( Pfeiffer et al., 2008 ). The erm transcripts are rst detected at embryonic stage 4-6 in the specic domainpreceding formation of the embryonic brain and remain highlyexpressed in the brain throughout development ( Chintapalli et al., 2007; Pfeiffer et al., 2008 ). Here, we report that Erm functions to restrict the developmental potential of INPs bypromoting Prospero-dependent termination of proliferation andsuppressing Notch-mediated dedifferentiation. By restricting their developmental potential, Erm ensures that INPs generate only differentiated neurons during Drosophila neurogenesis. RESULTS Earmuff Prevents Abnormal Expansion of Neural Progenitors in Type II Neuroblast Lineages All neuroblasts in l(2)5138 homozygous mutant brains were expressed neuroblast andlacked neuronal and glial markers ( Figures 1 B-1G; Figures S1B-S1D; data not shown). We mapped the l(2)5138 mutation to the erm gene, which encodes a homolog of the vertebrate Forebrain embryonic Matsuo-Takasaki et al., 2000 A /T nucleotide changein the ermcoding region, leading to the substitution of a leucine for a conserved histidine in the third C 2H2zinc-nger domain (data not shown). Consistent with its predicted molecular func- tion, ectopic expression of Erm transgenic proteins tagged with a HA epitope at the amino- or carboxyl-terminus driven byneuroblast-specic Wor-Gal4 was detected in the nuclei of neu- roblasts (data not shown). However, the expression of the HA- tagged Erm transgenic protein bearing the identical leucine-to- histidine substitution as in the l(2)5138 mutant was undetectable, suggesting that the mutant Erm protein is unstable (data not pre- sented). We conclude that l(2)5138 is a mutant allele of erm. To determine whether erm mutant brains have ectopic type I and/or type II neuroblasts, we analyzed the expression patternof Ase and Prospero (Pros), which are only expressed in type I neuroblasts ( Figure S1 A) (Bello et al., 2008; Boone and Doe, 2008; Bowman et al., 2008 ). We found that erm mutant brains contained over 20-fold more type II neuroblasts (Dpn +Ase/C0) than wild-type brains, with no numberof type I neuroblasts (Dpn +Ase+)(Figures 1 F-1H). Next, we the localization Prospero in mitotic neuroblasts in larval brains expressing GFP induced by Ase-Gal4 (Ase > GFP), which mimicked the expression pattern of the endogenous Ase protein ( Bowman et al., 2008 ). Inermmutant larval brains, all of basal Prospero crescents, but none of the mitotic type II neuroblasts Figure 1. erm Mutant Brains Show Ectopic Type II Neuroblasts (A) A summary of the type II neuroblast lineage. (B-H) While wild-type (+/+) and erm mutant brains contained a similar number of type I neuroblasts (Dpn+CycE+Ase+EdU+; white arrows), erm mutant brains contained ectopic type II neuroblasts (Dpn+CycE+Ase/C0EdU+; white arrowheads). In (H), wild-type brains contained 85 \u00b1 5.2 type I neuroblasts and 8.0 \u00b1 0 type II neuroblasts, whereas erm mutant brains contained 83.7 \u00b1 6.4 type I neruoblasts and 159 \u00b1 19.7 type II neuroblasts.

Furthermore, GFP-marked ermmutant type II neuroblast clones consistently contained multiple type II neuroblasts, whereas erm mutant type I neuroblast clones always contained single type I neuroblasts and neurons ( Figures 1 K and 1L). We conclude that ermmutant brains exhibit an abnormal expansion of type II neuroblasts. ermRegulates the Developmental Potential of INPs To determine the cellular origin of ectopic type II neuroblasts in erm mutant brains, we analyzed the identity of cells in the GFP-marked clones derived from wild-type or erm mutant type II neuroblasts using specic cell fate markers. At 30 hr after cloneinduction, wild-type and erm mutant neuroblast clones ap- peared indistinguishable, containing single parental neuroblasts (Dpn +Ase/C0;R10mm) in direct contact with 5-6 immature while most of the INPs (Dpn+Ase+;R6mm) were 1cell or more away from the parental neuroblasts ( Figures 2 A and 2B). At 48 hr after clone induction, the overall size of bothwild-type and erm mutant neuroblast clones increased signi- cantly due to an increase in cell number, reflecting continuous asymmetric divisions of the parental neuroblasts. In both wild- type and ermmutant clones, the parental neuroblasts remained surrounded by 5-6 immature INPs, while INPs and differentiated neurons (Dpn /C0Ase/C0Pros+) were found several cells away from the parental neuroblasts ( Figures 2 C-2F; Figures S2 A-S2F). However, erm mutant clones contained fewer INPs (16 \u00b1 4; n = 10 brains) than the wild-type clones (21 \u00b1 4; n = 10 brains).Importantly, erm mutant clones consistently 4-6 smaller ectopic S2 F). Thus, Erm is dispensable for both the generation and maturation of immature INPs. Ectopic type II neuroblasts in 48 hr erm mutant clones were always several cells away from the parental neuroblasts Figure 2. Erm Maintains the Limited Developmental Potential of INPs (A and B) At 30 hr after clone induction, both wild-type (+/+) and erm mutant neuroblast clones (yellow circles) contained a single parental neuroblast (white arrows) directly surrounded by immature INPs (white arrowheads) and 1-2 young INPs wild-type neuroblast clones (yellow circles) contained a single parental neuroblast (white arrows) in direct contact with immature INPs (white arrowheads) and young INPs (Dpn+Ase+). Older INPs were away from their parental neuroblasts and were surrounded by GMCs (white asterisks) and neurons (Dpn/C0Ase/C0). In contrast, the ermmutant clones contained ectopic type II neuroblast-like cells ([F], yellow arrows) further from the parental neuroblasts than most INPs and neurons. A summary diagram is shown below.(G)R9D11-Gal4 (Erm-Gal4 ) was undetectable in type II neuroblasts (white arrow) and immature INPs (white arrowheads), but was clearly detected in INPs.

This result strongly suggests that ectopic type II neuroblasts in erm mutant clones likely originate from INPs and Erm likely functions in INPs. However, we could not assess the spatial expression pattern of the endogenous Erm protein in larval brains due to lack of a specic antibody and low signals by fluorescent RNA in situ (data not shown). Alterna-tively, we analyzed the expression of the R9D series of Gal4 transgenes in which Gal4 is expressed under the control of over-lapping erm promoter fragments ( Pfeiffer et al., 2008 ). The expression of R9D11-Gal4 was clearly detected in INPs, but was undetectable in type II neuroblasts and immature INPseven when two copies of the UAS-mCD8-GFP transgenes were driven by two copies of R9D11-Gal4 at 32 /C14C for 72 hr after larval hatching Figure S2 sion of Erm-Gal4 was virtually undetectable in brain tumor mutant brains that contain thousands of type II neuroblastsand immature INPs ( Figure S2 H). While the expression of UAS- erm induced by the neuroblast-specic Wor-Gal4 driver led to premature loss of type II neuroblasts, expression of UAS-erm driven by Erm-Gal4 failed to exert any effect on type II neuro- blasts (data not shown). Importantly, targeted expression ofthe fly Erm or mouse Fezf1 or Fezf2 transgenic protein drivenbyR9D11-Gal4 restored the function of Erm and efciently rescued the ectopic neuroblast contains the enhancer element sufcient to restore the Erm function in INPs leading to suppression of ectopic type II neuroblasts in erm mutant brains. ermMutant INPs Dedifferentiate Back into Type II NeuroblastsMutant clonal analyses and overexpression studies strongly suggest that Erm functions to suppress reversion of INPs back into a neuroblast state. Here, we directly tested whether INPs inerm mutant brains can dedifferentiate back into type II neuro- blasts. We induced bgal-marked lineage clones originating exclu- sively from INPs via FRT-mediated recombination. We targeteda of flipase expression in INPs by heat-shockinglarvae carrying Erm- for 1 hr (see Experimental Proce- dures for details). At 72 hr after heat shock, INP clones in wild- type brains contained only differentiated neurons (Dpn/C0Ase/C0) (Figure 3 A). In contrast, INP clones in erm mutant brains con- tained one or more type II neuroblasts as well as immature Figure 3. erm Suppresses the Dedifferentiation of INPs (A-C) A wild-type (+/+) an erm mutant INP generated dedifferentiated neuroblasts (white immature ([B], neurons ([C], white asterisks).

We conclude that Erm functions to maintain the restricted developmental potential of INPs and pre- vents them from dedifferentiating back into a neuroblast state. We further assessed whether the dedifferentiated type II neuroblasts in erm mutant brains displayed multiple functional characteristics of normal type II neuroblasts.Apical-Basal Cell PolarityAll mitotic type II neuroblasts in wild-type and ermmutant brains showed normal establishment and maintenance of corticalpolarity by asymmetrically localizing and segregating atypicalProtein Kinase C (aPKC), Pins, Miranda, and Numb (data not shown). Proliferation ProleAll wild-type and ermmutant type II neuroblasts could be labeled with a 3 hr pulse of the thymidine analog EdU ( Figures 1 F 0and 1FG0), and incorporated EdU can be chased into INPs following a 12 hr EdU-free chase ( Figures 3 D and 3E). prospero and earmuff Promoter Activity While all type I neuroblasts in wild-type and erm mutant brains expressed Pros-Gal4 but lacked Erm-Gal4 expression, none of the type II neuroblasts in wild-type and erm mutant brains showed detectable expression of Pros-Gal4 orErm-Gal4 (Figures 3 F and 3G; data not shown). Formation of Glial ChambersIndividual neuroblast lineages are surrounded by the cortex glial membrane forming distinct chambers ( Pereanu et al., 2005 ). A wild-type brain hemisphere contained eight glial chambersencapsulating eight individual type II neuroblast lineages ( Fig- ure 3 H). In contrast, an ermmutant brain hemisphere contained more than 50 glial chambers, each containing one or more typeII neuroblasts and their presumptive progeny ( Figure 3 I). Taken together, INPs in erm mutant brains dedifferentiate back into apparently normal neuroblasts that can establishectopic type in differ-entiation and result in ectopic neuroblasts at the expense of GMC formation ( Betschinger et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2006a, 2006b, 2006c; Wang et al., 2006 ). To determine whether the dedifferentiation of INPs in erm mutant brains might be due to defects in cortical polarity, we assayed apical-basal polarity by Miranda, andNumb in larval brains localization of aPKC, Miranda, Prospero,and Numb as in wild-type brains ( Figures 4 A and 4B; data not shown). Thus, we conclude that INPs in ermmutant brains dedif- ferentiate while displaying normal cortical polarity. Erm Restricts Proliferation by Activating Prospero-Dependent Cell Cycle Exit To determine how Erm maintains the restricted developmental potential of INPs, we performed microarray analyses and foundthat prospero mRNA was drastically reduced in erm mutant brains compared to the control brains (M.W. and C.-Y.L., unpub-lished data). We conrmed that the relative level of prospero mRNA was indeed reduced by 60%-70% in erm mutant brain extracts by using real-time PCR (data not shown). These datasupported that Erm is necessary for proper transcription of pros- pero , and prompted us to test if overexpression of Erm might be sufcient to induce ectopic Prospero expression. We induceda short pulse of Erm expression in brain neuroblasts by shiftinglarvae carrying a UAS-erm transgene under the and tub-Gal80 tsto from 25/C14Ct o3 0/C14C. A 3.5 hr pulse of Erm expression was sufcient to induce nuclear localization ofProspero in larval brain neuroblasts ( Figure 5 A). Consistent with nuclear Prospero promoting termination of neuroblastproliferation, ectopic expression of Erm induced by Wor-Gal4 resulted in decreased neuroblasts compared to wild-typebrains ( Figure 5 B). Thus, we conclude that overexpression of Erm can restrict neuroblast proliferation by triggering nuclearlocalization of Pros. Our data suggest that Erm might restrict the developmental potential of INPs in part by limiting their proliferation by activatingProspero-dependent cell cycle exit. If so, we predict that overex-pression of Erm should induce ectopic nuclear Prospero in INPs and overexpression of Prospero should suppress ectopic neuro- blasts in erm mutant brains. In wild-type brains, 9.6% of INPs (32/325) showed nuclear localization of Prospero. However, overexpression of Erm driven by Erm-Gal4 led to localiza- tion of Prospero in 41.5% of INPs (105/253), likely restricting their proliferation potential and resulting in some parental type II neu-roblasts surrounded only by differentiated neurons ( Figures 5 C and 5D). Importantly, ectopic expression inducedbyErm-Gal4 efciently suppressed ectopic and neuronal erm mutant brains ( Figures 5E and 5F). Thus, Erm likely restricts the proliferation of INPs by promoting nuclear localization of Prospero. To conrm that Figure 4. erm Mutant INPs Show Normal Apical-Basal Polarity (A and B) Metaphase INPs in erm mutant brains expressing GFP induced by Ase-Gal4 showed asymmetric localization of aPKC, Miranda (Mira), Pros, and Numb (Nb). The scale bar, 5 mm.Developmental Cell Erm Limits the Transit Amplifying Cell Potential 130 Developmental Cell 18, 126-135, January 19, 2010 \u00aa2010 Elsevier Inc.Prospero indeed functions downstream of Erm to restrict the proliferation of INPs, we performed genetic epistatic analyses.Consistent with previously published results, prospero mutant type I neuroblast clones contained ectopic type I neuroblasts(Figure 5 G) (Bowman et al., 2008 ). In contrast, prospero mutant type II neuroblast clones exhibited accumulation of ectopic INPs while maintaining single parental neuroblasts ( Figure 5 H). Furthermore, overexpression of Erm failed to suppress ectopic INPs in prospero mutant type II neuroblast clones, consistent with Prospero functioning downstream of Erm ( Figure 5 I). These results indicate that blocking differentiation is not sufcient totrigger the dedifferentiation of INPs back into type II neuroblasts.Thus, Erm's restriction on the proliferation of INPs is dependent on Prospero function, but its suppression of the dedifferentiation of INPs is independent of Prospero.Erm Suppresses SignalingPrevious studies showed that overexpression of constitutively active Notch (Notch intra) in both type I and II neuroblasts is suf- cient to trigger ectopic neuroblasts ( Bowman et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2006 ). Here, we tested whether Erm suppresses the dedif- ferentiation of INPs by inhibiting Notch signaling. Indeed, knock- down of Notch function by RNAi in erm mutant brains led to a dramatic reduction in ectopic type II neuroblasts comparedtoerm mutant brains alone ( Figures A and 6B). Complementa- rily, ectopic expression of constitutively active Notch (Notch intra) induced by Erm-Gal4 transforms INPs into ectopic type II neuro- blasts ( Figure 6 C). Thus, reduced Notch function suppresses the dedifferentiation of INPs in erm mutant brains whereas ectopic activation of Notch induces the dedifferentiation of INPs. We Figure 5.

(B) Ectopic expression of Erm (57.9 \u00b1 8.6) or Pros (17.4 \u00b1 4.4 neuroblasts) driven by Wor-Gal4 was sufcient to proliferation prematurely (98.0 \u00b1 8.4 neuroblasts in wild-type brains).

Coexpression of Erm under the control of Erm-Gal4 is sufcient to suppress ectopic neuroblasts induced by the expression of Notchintra (Figure 6 D). Thus, we conclude that Erm can suppress the dedif- ferentiation of INPs by negatively regulating a Notch-activatedsignaling mechanism. DISCUSSION The limited developmental potential of transit amplifying cells is generally thought to be specied during fate determination (Farkas et al., 2008; Hodge et al., 2008; Sessa et al., 2008 ). In this study, we report a mechanism that actively maintains the restricted developmental potential of transit amplifying cells after specication of their identity. We show that the evolutionarilyconserved transcription factor Erm/Fezf functions to maintain the restricted developmental potential of INPs by limiting their proliferation potential and suppressing their dedifferentiationcapacity ( Figure 7 ). Combining proper specication of the transit amplifying cell identity and active maintenance of their restricteddevelopmental potential ensures the generation of differentiatedprogeny and prevents aberrant expansion of stem cells. The lineage clones derived from single INPs in erm 1/erm2 mutant brains contain dedifferentiated neuroblasts, immature Figure 6.

Several mechanisms could lead to the diversity of cells within the clones. First, INPs in erm mutant brains might generate GMCs and neurons initially due to the presence of maternally deposited Erm. However, erm transcripts are undetectable in both adult male and female germlines by microarray analyses and in stage 1-3 embryos by RNA in situ ( Chintapalli et al., 2007 ;http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0031375.html; data not shown). Furthermore, the erm1/erm2allelic combination resulted in little to no zygotic Erm in the brain because the erm1mutation likely leads to the production of an unstable Erm protein, whereas the erm2mutation deletes the entire erm open reading frame (data not shown). Additionally, the ectopic neuroblast phenotype in erm1/erm2mutant brains can be observed as early as 36-48 hr after larval hatching(data not presented). Thus, generation of GMCs and differenti- ated neurons by INPs in erm 1/erm2mutant brains is unlikely due to the maternal effect. Alternatively, erm may promote GMC differentiation in the type II neuroblast lineage, and inerm mutant brains, GMCs might dedifferentiate back into neuroblasts. If so, we would predict an ectopic accumulation of INPs in similarly staged mosaic clones derived from erm mutant type II neuroblasts as compared to wild-type clones.However, 48 hr ermmutant single neuroblast clones consistently contained fewer INPs when compared to the wild-type clones(Figures 2 C-2F). In addition, blocking GMC differentiation by removing Prospero function resulted in ectopic accumulationof INPs but did not lead to ectopic neuroblast formation(Figure 5 H). Therefore, the diversity of cells within erm mutant clones is also unlikely due to blocking GMC differentiation. Wefavor the interpretation that erm mutant INPs dedifferentiate into apparently normal neuroblasts that can give rise to all cell types found in a type II neuroblast lineage. Consistently, the dedifferentiated neuroblasts in erm mutant brains exhibitedDevelopmental Cell Erm Limits the Transit Amplifying Cell Potential 132 Developmental Cell 18, 126-135, January 19, 2010 \u00aa2010 Elsevier Inc.normal cortical polarity and proliferation potential ( Figures 3 and 4 ). Furthermore, the dedifferentiated neuroblasts in erm mutant brains also lost the expression of Pros-Gal4 and Erm-Gal4 and established ectopic type II neuroblast lineages encapsulated by the cortex glial membrane ( Figures 3 and 4 ). Thus, we conclude that Erm likely restricts the developmental potential of INPs by limiting proliferation and suppressingdedifferentiation. Although mutations in erm,brain tumor , and numb genes all lead to ectopic type II neuroblasts, the proteins appear to regu-late INPs at distinct steps in the type II neuroblast lineage(Figure S3 ). Numb and Brain tumor function cooperatively, but nonredundantly, to ensure that immature INPs undergo matura-tion and commit to the INP fate ( Boone and Doe, 2008; Bowman et al., 2008 ). While ectopic expression of Numb induces prema- ture differentiation of type II neuroblasts and immature INPs(J. Haenfler, K.L.G., and C.-Y.L., unpublished data), not sufcient to suppress ectopic neuroblasts inbrain tumor mutant brains (H. Komori and C.-Y.L., unpublished data). Thus, Numb likely promotes differentiation of immatureINPs whereas Brain tumor likely prevents immature INPs, whichare unstable in nature, from adopting their parental neuroblast fate. More studies will be necessary to discern whether ectopic neuroblasts in brain tumor mutant brains arise from dedifferenti- ation of partially differentiated immature INPs or failure of immature INPs to initiate differentiation. In contrast, immature INPs in erm mutant brains mature into functional INPs that exhibit normal cortical polarity and proliferation potential and can generate GMCs and neurons ( Figures 2 A-2F, 3D, 3E, and 4; Figure S3 ). Additionally, overexpression of Brain tumor or Numb in INPs was not sufcient to suppress ectopic neuroblasts in erm mutant brains (data not shown). Finally, lineage clones derivedfrom single INPs in erm mutant brains always contain ectopic type II neuroblasts, multiple immature INPs, INPs, GMCs, and neurons ( Figures 3 B and 3C). These results indicate that Erm is dispensable for maturation of immature INPs and is not withinthe genetic hierarchy specifying the INP identity. Instead, Ermmaintains the restricted developmental potential of INPs after specication of their identity. Prospero encodes a homeodomain transcription factor, and nuclear Prospero has been shown to trigger cell cycle exit and GMC differentiation ( Choksi et al., 2006; Doe et al., 1991; Maur- et al., 2008 ). In the wild-type brain, 9.6% of INPs showed nuclear Prospero and were likely undergoing differentiation(data not shown). prospero mutant type II neuroblast clones showed ectopic accumulation of INPs but contained single neu-roblasts, indicating that blocking differentiation is not sufcientto trigger the dedifferentiation of INPs ( Figure 5 H). Thus, Pros- pero restricts the proliferation potential of INPs but does notsuppress dedifferentiation of INPs. While ectopic expression of Prospero in INPs can restore neuronal differentiation in erm mutant brains, targeted expres- sion of Erm in neuroblasts or INPs was sufcient to induce rapidnuclear localization of Prospero in these cells and terminate theirproliferation ( Figure 5 ). In wild-type brains, Prospero is seques- tered in mitotic neural progenitors ( Ikeshima-Kataoka et localization and segregation of Mirandaand Prospero (data not shown). As such, Erm likely restricts the proliferation potential of INPs by indirectly promoting nuclear localization of Prospero. Therefore, Prospero does not localizein the nuclei of mitotically active INPs, which express Miranda, but does localize in the nuclei of GMCs that do not express Miranda. How does Erm suppress the dedifferentiation of INPs? Our results show that reduced Notch function can efciently suppress ectopic neuroblasts in erm mutant brains while constitutive activation of Notch signaling induced the dediffer- entiation of INPs ( Figures 6 A-6C). Importantly, coexpression Erm is sufcient to suppress the dedifferentiation of INPstriggered by expression of constitutively active Notch intra(Fig- ure 6 D). Together, these results strongly suggest that Erm prevents the dedifferentiation of INPs by antagonizing aNotch-activated mechanism through interfering with theassembly of the Notch transcriptional activator complex or in-hibiting the expression of Notch targets. Intriguingly, the amino terminus of all Fezf proteins contains an engrailed homology 1 domain. This domain can mediate direct interaction with theconserved transcriptional corepressor Groucho that can func- tion as and Hibi, 2009 ). Additional experiments will be needed to discern how Erm antagonizes Notch-activateddedifferentiation of INPs. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Fly Genetics and Transgenes A total of six erm alleles were recovered from EMS mutagenesis following a standard protocol. erm2was generated by a FRT-based high-resolution deletion method and veried by PCR (Parks et al., 2004 ). The cDNA for CG31670 was obtained from the Drosophila Genome Resource Center, sequenced, and cloned into the pUAST-HA vector for germline transformation. Mouse fezf1 and fezf2 cDNAs were sequenced (M. Hibi) and cloned into the pUAST-HA vector for germline transformation. Drosophila cultures were kept at 25/C14C on standard cornmeal food. Other mutant alleles and trans- genes used in this study include brat11(Lee et al., 2006c ),pros17, FRT82B (Lee et al., 2006b ),UAS- et al., 1995 ),Wor-gal4 (Lee et al., 2006b ),Ase-gal4 (Zhu et al., 2006 ), and R9D-Gal4 lines (Pfeiffer et al., 2008 ). The UAS-Notch RNAi lines were obtained from the Vienna Stock Center. Immunofluorescent Staining and Antibodies Antibody staining was performed as previously described (Lee et al., 2006b ). The rabbit Ase antibody was raised against a previously described syntheticpeptide (Brand and Perrimon, 1993 ). Other antibodies used in this study include guinea pig Ase (1:100; J. Knoblich), rat rat HA (1:2000, Roche). Secondary anti-bodies were from Molecular Probes (details are available upon request). Theconfocal images were acquired on a Leica SP5 scanning confocal microscopewith AOBS.Developmental Cell Erm Limits the Transit Amplifying Cell Potential Developmental Cell 18, 126-135, January 19, 2010 \u00aa2010 Elsevier Inc. 133Edu Pulse-Chase Larvae were aged for 72 hr after hatching, and were pulse labeled for 3 hr byfeeding on the Kankel-White media containing 50 mg/ml EdU (5-ethynyl- 2 0deoxyuridine) (Lee et al., 2006c ). Half of the larvae were processed for stain- ing immediately following the pulse; remaining larvae were transferred to stan-dard media for a 12 hr EdU-free chase. Larvae were dissected and processedfor antibody staining as previously described (Lee et al., 2006b ). Incorporated EdU was detected by Click-iT fluorescent as described inthe Click-iT product literature (Invitrogen). Lineage Clonal Analysis We initially performed genetic clonal analyses of INPs using Ase-Gal4 by crossing erm 1, Actin-FRT-Stop-FRT-lacZ/CyO, Actin-GFP erm2,A s e - tub-Gal80tsflies. At 24 hr after hatching, erm1/erm2larvae shifted to 31/C14C for 48 hr to inactivate Gal80ts, allowing FRT-mediated recombination to induce permanently marked lineage clones.The expression level of Ase-Gal4 is very low (Bowman et al., 2008 ), allowing us to induce genetic clones at a very low frequency. However, due to the pro-longed incubation time at the nonpermissive temperature, clones derived fromtwo neighboring INPs sometimes became overlapped, resulting in appearanceof a ''large'' clone. We repeated this experiment by using Erm-Gal4 , whose expression level was signicantly higher compared to Ase-Gal4 (M.W. and C.-Y.L., data not shown). We crossed Actin-GFP; Erm-Gal4 flies to erm2/CyO, hr after hatching, erm1/erm2larvae were shifted to 31/C14C for 1 hr to induce positively marked genetic clones derived from single INP. Larvaewere returned back to 25 /C14C for 72 hr prior to processing larval brains for antibody staining. Mutant Clonal Analyses We induced mosaic clones derived from erm1andpros17mutant neuroblasts by following a previously established protocol (Lee et al., 2006c; Lee and Luo,2001 ). Overexpression of Notch intra Overexpression of Notchintrain was UAS-Notchintra/CyO, Actin-GFP; tub-Gal80tsflies to Erm-Gal4 flies.

Keeping neural progenitor cells progenitor cells on a short leash during Drosophila neurogenesis Mo Weng and Cheng-Yu Lee The developmental potential of stem cells and progenitor cells must be functionally distinguished to ensure the generation of diverse cell types while maintaining the stem cell pool throughout the lifetime of an organism. In contrast to stem cells,progenitor cells possess restricted developmental potential,allowing them to give rise to only a limited number of post-mitotic progeny. Failure to establish or maintain restrictedprogenitor cell potential can perturb tissue development andhomeostasis, and probably contributes to tumor initiation.Recent studies using the developing fruit fly Drosophila larval brain have provided molecular insight into how thedevelopmental potential is restricted in neural progenitor cells.

DOI 10.1016/j.conb.2010.09.005 Introduction Restricted developmental potential allows progenitor cells to generate a limited number of terminally differ- entiated progeny, amplifying the output of stem cellswhile safeguarding the stem cell pool throughout the natural lifespan of an organism. Expanded progenitor cell potential might result in the formation of aberrant stem-like cells, contributing to developmental defects and possibly tumor initiation. In contrast to stem cells, how progenitor cell potential is restricted remains largelyunknown owing to their short-lived nature. The fruitflyDrosophila larval brain, which consists of the central brain and optic lobe, possesses well-dened lineages ofneural stem cells that generate progenitor cells in a highlyreproducible pattern ( Figure 1 ). These lineages provide an excellent in vivo system for studying regulation of the progenitor cell potential at a single-cell resolution. Con-servation in gene function between flies and mammals suggests that molecular mechanisms that regulate pro-genitor cell potential in Drosophila neural stem cell lineages might be similarly employed during vertebrate neurogenesis. Central brain neuroblasts generate neural progenitor cells with distinct developmental potential All neural stem cells in the central brain (called neuro- blasts) undergo repetitive asymmetric divisions to self- renew and to generate a neural progenitor cell with limited developmental potential. The cortex of a mitoticcentral brain neuroblast is highly polarized, and the role of this polarity in neuroblast asymmetric division has been extensively reviewed [ 1-4]. Discrete protein complexes are assembled in the apical and basal cortical domains. In telophase, the apical protein complexes segregate into the self-renewing neuroblast, whereas the basal protein com-plexes segregate into the neural progenitor cell. Bothgenetic and correlative live imaging studies indicate that the apical protein complexes have dual functions: pro- moting neuroblast identity and targeting the basal proteincomplexes into the neural progenitor cell. The basal protein complexes function specically in restricting the neural progenitor cell potential [ 5]. Two classes of central brain neuroblast lineages (types I and II) can be unambiguously identied based on the progenitor pro- geny generated and the combination of cell fate markersexpressed [ 6 /C15/C15,7/C15/C15,8/C15/C15](Figure 1 ). Below, we discuss the functional properties of neural progenitor cells generatedin the type I and type II neuroblast lineages and themolecular mechanisms that restrict their developmental potential. Neuroblasts and neural progenitor cells in the type I lineage A type I neuroblast divides asymmetrically to generate a self-renewing daughter neuroblast and a neural progeni- tor cell called a ganglion mother cell (GMC) that dividesonce to produce two post-mitotic neurons [ 6 /C15/C15,7/C15/C15,8/C15/C15]. During this asymmetric division, the basal proteins Brain tumor and Prospero exclusively segregate into the GMC by binding to the scaffolding protein Miranda, whileNumb partitions into the GMC independently of Mir- anda. The basal proteins remain asymmetrically segre- gated into GMCs in a telophase brain tumor mutant neuroblast, and genetic clones derived from single brain tumor mutant neuroblasts always contain one neuroblast and many neurons per clone ( Figure 2). Thus, Brain tumor is either dispensable or functionally redundant with other proteins in restricting the GMC potential. www.sciencedirect.com Current Opinion in Neurobiology 2010, 21:1-72Developmental neuroscience CONEUR-851; NO.

(a)The apical and basal during asymmetric divisions of neural stem/progenitor cells in the type I and type II neuroblast lineage in the markers allow unambiguous identification of neural stem/progenitor cells in the type I and type II neuroblast lineage in unambiguous identification of neuroepithelial stem cells and progenitor cells Figure 2 A summary of the identity of cells derived from type I and II neuroblasts lacking or overexpressing key proteins required to restrict the progenitor cellpotential. Type I neuroblasts encodes a homeodomain transcription factor, and plays a key role in specifying neuronal and glial cell types in the developing nervous system [ 9-12]. Although Prospero is expressed in neuroblasts, it is kept out of neuroblast nuclei by the combination of nuclear exclusion and binding to the scaffolding protein Miranda [ 13-16]. The Miranda -Prospero complex localizes the into the GMC telophase. Uponcompletion of cell division, Miranda becomes proteoly- tically degraded, and Prospero is released from the cortex and localizes to the GMC nuclei [ 17]. Nuclear Prospero restricts the GMC potential by suppressing genes that promote the neuroblast identity and activating genes that promote differentiation and cell cycle exit[12,18 ]. While mitotic prospero mutant clones contain neuroblasts at the expense of neurons [ 12,19 -22] 2 ). Overexpression of accumulation in neuroblast nuclei, trig-gering premature loss of neuroblasts. These data indicate that Prospero is necessary and sufcient to restrict the GMC potential. numb encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein essen- tial for proper neuronal the develop- ing nervous system [ 23-27]. Eighty-ve percent of numb mutant type I neuroblast lineage clones contain morethan one neuroblast per clone despite asymmetric segre-gation GMCs more, mutations that perturb asymmetric lead to formation of ectopic neuro-blasts, a phenotype that can be suppressed by overexpres- sion of Numb in neuroblasts [ 28,29 ]. Thus, Numb probably restricts the GMC potential independent of Prospero. Fly and mouse studies have shown that Numb suppresses Notch signaling in the developing nervous system, raising the possibility that Numb might restrictthe GMC potential by antagonizing Notch signaling. Expression of multiple Notch reporters is detectable in neuroblasts but is undetectable in GMCs in the wild-type brain [ 8 /C15/C15,30]. Additionally, ectopic expression of a con- stitutively active form of Notch (Notch intra) perturbs neuroblast asymmetric divisions, leading to a massiveincrease in neuroblasts the expense of neurons [8 /C15/C15,30]. Unlike Prospero, ectopic expression of Numb or knockdown of the Notch function by RNA interference is insufcient to trigger premature loss of type I neuro- blasts [ 8/C15/C15]. Thus, inhibition of the Notch signaling by Numb is necessary but not sufcient to limit the GMCpotential. Neuroblasts and neural progenitors in the type II lineage A type II neuroblast divides asymmetrically to self-renew and generate an intermediate neural progenitor cell(INP), previously referred to as a transit amplifyingGMC, a secondary neuroblast or an intermediate pro- genitor [ 6 /C15/C15,7/C15/C15,8/C15/C15](Figure 1 ). A newly born INP is immature, and is arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and must undergo maturation, during which it acquires restricted developmental potential beforeresuming proliferation [ 8]. A mature INP divides asym- metrically several times, each time self-renewing byproducing a daughter INP and a GMC. The basal proteinsBrain tumor and Numb, inherited from the asymmetri- cally dividing parental neuroblasts, establish the restricted developmental potential in an immature INP[8 /C15/C15]. Following completion of maturation, the transcrip- tion factor Earmuff maintains the INP potential [ 22/C15/C15]. These sequential mechanisms play key roles in restrictingthe INPs potential. Establishment of the restricted developmental potential in INPs While a wild-type type II neuroblast clone always con- tains one -5 immature INPs and 20 -30 INPs, abrain tumor mutant type II neuroblast clone contains almost neuroblasts [ 8/C15/C15](Figure 2 ). Interest- ingly, a mitotic brain shows normal apical -basal cortical polarity and asym- metric of Numb into immature INPs. Thus,ectopic type II neuroblasts in the brain tumor mutant brain probably arise from de-differentiation of immature INPs that fail to acquire restricted developmental poten- tial despite inheriting Numb. These data suggest thatBrain tumor probably functions parallel to Numb to promote restriction of the INP potential. Overexpression of Brain tumor does not effect the expression of a Notch reporter in neuroblasts, and removal of brain tumor does not alter binary cell fate determination in the sensoryorgan precursor lineage, a system highly sensitive to theloss of Notch function [ 8 /C15/C15]. Together, these data strongly suggest that Brain tumor is necessary but not sufcient torestrict the INP potential. Despite showing normal apical -basal cortical polarity and asymmetric segregation of Brain tumor into immature INPs, numb mutant type II neuroblast clones also consist of mostly neuroblasts [ 8 /C15/C15,28](Figure 2 ). Thus, ectopic type II neuroblasts in the numb mutant brain might also arise from de-differentiation of immature INPs owing toaberrant activation of the Notch signaling mechanism. Indeed, ectopic expression of Notch intraleads to ectopic type II neuroblasts at the expense of immature INPs, whereas overexpression of Numb or knockdown of the Notch function by RNA interference results in the pre- mature loss of type II neuroblasts [ 8/C15/C15]. Thus, by antag- onizing Notch, Numb is necessary and sufcient toestablish the restricted developmental potential in imma- ture INPs. Taken together, Brain tumor and Numbfunction establish the INP potential during maturation.Keeping neural progenitor cells on a short leash during Drosophila neurogenesis Weng and Lee 3 CONEUR-851; NO.

Keeping neural progenitor cells 2010, 21:1-7Maintenance of the restricted developmental potential in INPs Following maturation, the INP potential requires an active mechanism mediated by the earmuff gene for maintenance during limited rounds of asymmetric div-isions [ 22 /C15/C15]. While the number of type I neuroblasts remain unchanged in the earmuff mutant brain, the popu- lation of type II neuroblasts drasticallyexpanded ( ). Surprisingly, polarity and undergo repeated INPs that matureinto basal proteins Brain tumor, Prospero andNumb into GMCs that produce differentiated neurons. Thus, it is unlikely that ectopic type II neuroblasts in the earmuff mutant brain arise from de-differentiation of immature INPs owing to failure to acquire restricted developmental potential. Analyses of the cell fate mar- kers in lineage clones derived from earmuff mutant type II neuroblasts indicate that following maturation, INPs fail to maintain restricted developmental potential and de- differentiate back into type II neuroblasts. Analyses of itspromoter expression pattern reveal that earmuff is undetectable in type II neuroblasts and immature INPsand instead, is detected in INPs. Additionally, ectopictype II neuroblasts in the earmuff mutant brain can be suppressed by restoring the expression of Earmuff inINPs under the control of its own promoter. Thus, Ear-muff specically maintains the INP potential. One way to maintain the restricted potential of INPs is to limit their proliferation capacity. In the wild-type brain, an INP shows a limited proliferation capacity before exit from cell cycle and terminal differentiation, processes probablyregulated by nuclear localization of Prospero [ 12,31 ]. While nuclear Prospero is rarely detected in INPs in the wild-typebrain, overexpression of Earmuff in neuroblasts or INPscan induce almost a ten-fold increase in the frequency of nuclear Prospero and premature loss of these cells [22 /C15/C15]. Furthermore, INP-specic expression of Prospero can partially suppress ectopic neuroblast phenotype in brain. Moreover, prospero mutant INPs generate ectopic INPs at the expense of neurons, but do not de-differentiate back into type II neuroblasts [ 22/C15/C15]. Thus, a Prospero-dependent mechanism limits INP pro-liferation promotes INP differentiation, whereas aProspero-independent mechanism prevents INPs fromacquiring the type II neuroblast identity. Neuroblast-specic expression of Notch intraleads to ecto- pic neuroblasts at the expense of GMCs and immature INPs, suggesting that downregulation of Notch might be a general mechanism to restrict the developmental poten-tial in neural progenitor cells. ectopic type II neuroblasts, raising the possibility thatearmuff might restrict the developmental potential of INPs by antagonizing Notch signaling [ 22 /C15/C15]. In agree- ment with this hypothesis, knockdown of Notch function by RNA interference partially suppresses the ectopic type II neuroblast phenotype in the earmuff mutant brain. Furthermore, overexpression of Earmuff in INPs can suppress the formation of ectopic type II neuroblasts induced by overexpression of Notch intra. A recent study demonstrates that the vertebrate homologs of Earmuff can suppress Notch signaling by directly binding to the promoter of a Notch target gene Hes5 during mousecortical neurogenesis [ 32 /C15]. Notch signaling plays a crucial role in distinguishing neural stem cell from intermediateprogenitors during both embryonic and adult brain neu-rogenesis [ 32 /C15,33]. Thus, Earmuff and its vertebrate homologs probably regulate the neurogenesis through antagonizing the Notchsignaling. Optic lobe neuroepithelial stem cells generate two types of neural progenitor cells Neuroepithelial stem cells in the developing optic lobe initially undergo symmetric divisions to expand the stemcell population, then differentiate into neural progenitors that generate terminally differentiated neurons through limited rounds of asymmetric divisions [ 34 /C15/C15](Figure 1 ). This dynamic mechanism allows rapid generation of a large number of post-mitotic progeny from a relatively small population of stem cells, and is widely used in thecontext of development and regeneration [ 35,36 ]. Failure to properly restrict the developmental potential in neu-roepithelial stem cells and their progenitor progeny mightcontribute to childhood tumors of epithelial origin [37,38 ]. Thus, understanding how developmental poten- tial is precisely specied in neuroepithelial stem cells and neural progenitor cells will probably provide novel insight into development and tumorigenesis. The functional property of neuroepithelial stem cells changes dynamically in the outer proliferation center of the developing optic lobe. Before the third larval instar,most neuroepithelial stem cells predominantly undergo symmetric divisions to expand the stem cell population, forming a C-shaped swath flanked with few neuroblasts atthe medial edge bordering the central brain. In the instar, neuroepithelial stem cells progressively tran- sition into neuroblasts from the medial edge toward the lateral edge of the optic lobe, leading to narrowing of theneuroepithelia and widening of the neuroblast swath [34 /C15/C15,39,40/C15/C15]. Neuroblasts in the optic lobe share many parallels with INPs in the central brain, including expres- sion of similar cell fate markers and asymmetric segre- gation of similar cell polarity proteins. A neuroblast in the optic lobe also undergoes limited rounds of asymmetricdivisions to regenerate and to produce a GMC that gives rise to two terminally differentiated progeny [ 21,34 /C15/C15].4Developmental neuroscience CONEUR-851; NO. OF PAGES 7 Please cite this article in press as: Weng M, Lee C-Y. Keeping neural progenitor cells www.sciencedirect.comHowever, the molecular mechanism that restricts the neuroblast potential in the optic lobe has yet to be investigated and will not be discussed further. Below,we will focus on the molecular mechanism that regulates the neuroepithelial stem cells. Comparative expression proling of micro-dissected neu- roepithelia and neuroblasts from the optic lobe suggests that the Notch signaling mechanism probably plays a keyrole in maintaining the neuroepithelial stem cell identity [41 /C15/C15]. Removal of the Notch function triggers premature transition from neuroepithelia to neuroblasts, whereas constitutive activation of Notch signaling prevents the transition. Thus, downregulation of Notch signaling is necessary and sufcient for the transition from neuroe-pithelia to neuroblasts in the larval optic lobe. How is the Notch signaling spatially and temporally regulated in the developing optic lobe allowing synchro- nous transition from neuroepithelial stem a medial-to-lateral manner? Neuroepithelial stemcells become transiently arrested in cell cycle before reach- ing the transition zone where they lose their epithelial characteristics and assume the stereotypical round neuro-blast morphology [ 42 /C15/C15]. The expression of delta, encoding a Notch ligand, is detected at a high level in 1 -2r o w so f cells that are among those transiently arrested in cell cycle[40 /C15/C15,42/C15/C15]. Since Delta activates Notch cell non- autonomously and suppresses Notch signaling cellautonomously, overexpression or removal of delta leads to both inhibition and acceleration of neuroblast formation. This result suggests that the coordinated change between the level of Delta and the Notch signaling provides the cuethat times the transition from neuroepithelia to neuro- blasts. Interestingly, the proneural gene lethal of scute is also highly expressed in 1 -2 rows of cells that are among those transiently arrested in cell cycle [ 40 /C15/C15,42/C15/C15]. While removal of the lethal of scute function mildly delays the transition of neuroepithelial stem cells to neuroblasts, overexpression of lethal of scute suppresses Notch signaling and promotes premature transition. The dynamic integ-ration of Delta and Lethal of scute species the transitionfrom neuroepithelia to neuroblasts spatially in the optic lobe by repressing the Notch signaling. The swath of neuroblasts widens synchronously from the medial edge toward the lateral edge of the developing optic lobe, suggesting that the transition from neuroe-pithelia to neuroblasts might also be temporally coordi-nated. Intriguingly, the output of the Janus kinase (Jak/ Stat) signaling mechanism coincides with the timing of neuroepithelia transitioning into neuroblasts: Jak/Statsignaling is the highest at the lateral edge and the lowest at the medial edge. Removal of the components in the Jak/Stat signaling mechanism leads to precocious tran-sition of neuroepithelia into neuroblasts, while constitu- tive activation of the Jak/Stat signaling delays thetransition [ 40 /C15/C15]. In addition, inactivation of the Fat- Hippo signaling mechanism delays the transition from neuroepithelia to neuroblasts, whereas constitutive acti-vation of the Fat-Hippo signaling the tran- sition at the medial edge of neuroepithelia [ 42 /C15/C15]. Taken together, the Jak/Stat and the Fat-Hippo signaling mech- anisms provide temporal control of the transition from neuroepithelia to neuroblasts. More experiments will be necessary to elucidate whether these two signaling path-ways promote the transition through Notch or indepen- dent of Notch. Discussion The developmental potential in stem cells and progenitor cells must be precisely dened to ensure normal devel-opment and prevent accumulation of aberrant stem-like cells. Studies of the neural stem cell lineages in the developing Drosophila larval brain have begun to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying how neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells are functionally distin- guished at a single-cell resolution. Accumulating datapoint to downregulation of the Notch signaling by various mechanisms as a crucial step in establishing the restricted developmental potential in neural progenitor cells. How-ever, additional mechanisms mediated by Brain tumor or Prospero function non-redundantly to the Notch sig- naling, and play important roles in restricting the devel-opmental potential of neural progenitor cells. Notch also distinguishes neural stem cells from neural progenitor cells in the developing mouse brain [ 43 /C15,44]. It will be interesting to test whether Brain tumor and Prospero indeed function in parallel of the Notch signaling in restricting the developmental potential in neural progeni-tor cells, and whether the vertebrate homologs of Brain tumor or Prospero might also play similar roles in regulat- ing neural progenitor cells during mouse cortical neuro-genesis. Emerging evidence strongly suggests that the Jak-Stat and Fat-Hippo signaling mechanisms regulate the timing of restricting the developmental potential inneuroepithelial stem cells. It will be important to deter- mine whether these two signaling mechanisms might promote the transition from neuroepithelia to neuroblastsin the developing optic lobe via a Notch-dependent or Notch-independent mechanism.
