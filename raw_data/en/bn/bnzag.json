While progress has been made in reducing U.S. infant mortality rates, the nation must do more. Inequality is shown in substantial and persi stent racial/eth nic and income disparities. Moreover, in 2010, the U.S. ranked 24th in infant mortality compared to other industrialized nations of the world. In June, 2012, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius made a commitment to the development of the natio n's first national strategy to reduce infant mortality. This report of the Secretary's Advisory Com mittee on Infant Mortality (SACIM), as e mpaneled for 2011 -2012, makes recommendations to serve as the framework for the Secretary, HHS agencies, and the entire federal govern ment as they define and implement an official federal action plan. In addition, we stand prepared to assist further in develop ment and dissemination of a publi c-private national strategy to reduce infant mortality. First, the nation should set objectives that reflect our commitment. In 2010, the U.S. infant mortality rate was 6.15 deaths per 1,000 live births, and the average for industrialized countries was 5 . The Healthy People 2020 objecti ve is set at 6.0 per 1,000. Based on rece nt trends, however, SACIM believes the targets should be \"five -five by fifteen\" and \"four -five by twenty\" - that is, the United States should aim to reduce the infant mortality to 5.5 per 1000 by 2015, and to 4.5 by 2020. Second, any plan or strategy to reduce infant mortality should be grounded in a set of core principles. The following core principles were defined by SACIM to guide the recommendations in this report. We belie ve that the national strategy and the HHS action plan to reduce infant mortality should: Reflect a life course perspective Engage and empower consu mers Reduce inequity and disparities and ameliorate the negative effects of social determinants Advance syste ms coordination and service integration Prote ct the existing maternal and child health safety net programs Leverage change throu gh multi-sector, public and private collaboration Define actionable strategies that emphasize prevention and are continually infor med by evidence and measurement. 3 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 SACIM proposes six strategic directions or \"big ideas\". These strategic directions define key areas for action and each incorporates specific SACIM rec ommended strate gies and activities. Note Care Act (ACA) prov ides opport unities within each area. In addition, many actions recom mended by SACIM require a change in approach rather than new invest ment or budget. The six big ideas/strategic directions call for the nation to: 1. Strategic Direction 1: Improve the health of women before during, and beyond pregnancy . Nothing could be more critical to the health of the next generation than to improve the health of wo men prior to conce ption. The nation is on the right track with ACA, including: affordable coverage, emphasis on cli nical preventi ve services, innovations to better serve those covered by Medicaid, interventions for chronic conditions and mental health, and community public health and preventive services invest ments. Women need clinical service s, community services, and social supports to empower them to achieve optimal health and fulfill their reproductive health goals. Effective imple mentati on of such efforts will result in improved birth outco mes, optimal health for infants, and reduced infant morbidity and mortalit y. Recommendation s: 1.A. Monitor coverage and promote use of women's clinical preventive services. 1.B. Partner with professionals to develop clinical guidelines for well -woman visits. 1.C. Use Medicaid innovation, demonstrations, and flexibility to offer states new avenues for deliv ering effective, evidenc e-based interve ntions to women. 1.D. Increase efforts to ensure mental/behavi oral health and social support services for women. 2. Strategic Direction 2: Ensure access to a continuum of safe and high -quality, patient - centered care . Currently, the Collaborati ve Innovation and Improvement Networks (COIIN) supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration, Medicaid perinatal quality improvement projects, and action in select hospitals and health syste ms demonstrate what can and should be done. The Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality and other entities have defined measures. Still, we have far to go toward assuring that all women and infants receive quality care as defined by the Instit ute of Medicine, that is, care which is safe, timely, effective, efficient, equitable, and patient - centered. 4 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Recommendation s: 2.A. Strengthen state leadership and capac ity to improve birth outco mes and reduce infant mortality through the HRSA Collab orative Innovation and Improvement Network (COIIN). 2.B. Use Medicaid to drive quality and improve the health of wo men and infants. 2.C. Support quality improve ment activities through other agencies of HHS, including the Agency for Healthc are Research and Quality (AHRQ) and CDC. 2.D. Support health coverage for all newborns by requiring newborn coverage for all infants (i.e., with public or private coverage) and making temporary coverage available to those who are uninsured at birth. 2.E. Maxi mize the ACA invest ments in community health centers and workforce capacity. 3. Strategic Direction 3: Redeploy key evide nce-based, highly effecti ve preventive interventions to a new generation of familie s. We know that breastfeeding, family planning, immunization, smoking cessation, and safe sleep are proven, effective interventions for reducing infant mortality. It is clear, however, that new, culturally congruent social marketing messages and modern communication strategies (i.e., social networking, Internet) are essential to inform and motivate today's young fa milies. Support and adequate financing for these proven prevention strategies is equally critical. Recommendations : 3.A. Design and implement new health promotion and social marketing campaigns to accelerate use of five key preventive interventio ns. 3.B. Condu ct health promotion and social marketing campaigns to inform families about the warning signs of pregnancy complic ations and infant risks and the actions families should take when proble ms arise 4. Strategic Direction 4: Increase he alth equity and reduce disparities by targeting social determinants of health throu gh both investments in high -risk, under - resourced communities and major initi atives to address povert y. The underlying causes of persistent racial/ethnic and socioecono mic disparities in infant mortality must be specifically tackled. Poverty and racism profoundly affect psychosocial well-being and are widely considered to be contributors to disparities in birth outco mes and infant mortality. A national strategy to reduce infant mort ality must include sustained commitment to address social determinants of health in order to increase health equity. 5 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 SACIM recom mends comprehensive, community -based initiatives that increase access, opportunity, and resources in high-risk areas. SACIM also strongly recommends concerted efforts to reduce the impact of pov erty on families in their childbearing years. Recommendations : 4.A. Convene an interagency expert panel to set goals for clo sing infant mortality gaps. 4.B. Support and transform the federal Healthy Start program and maximize its potential to reduce infant mortality, eliminate disparities, and increase health equity. 4.C. Use federal interagency collaboration to turn the curve on social deter minants of health at the community level by co ncentrating investments from multiple progra ms in place -based initiatives. 4.D. Address and alleviate poverty, which has a known impact on infant mortality, through enhanced use of income supports through TANF, E ITC, and other policies. 4.E. Add SACIM to list of HHS Initiatives aiming to eliminate disparities and increase health equity. 5. Strategic Direction 5: Invest in adequate data, monitoring, and surveillance systems to measure access, quality, and outcomes . The nation's vital statistics syste m, perinatal surveys, Medicaid perinatal data collection, quality measure ment systems, and other data syste ms need to be dramatically improved. Timely and accurate data are needed to help inform the develop ment and implementation of important policies and progra ms for families across the country. Recommendations : 5.A. Make invest ments in the National Vital Statistics system to assure timely, and accurate birth and maternal and infant death statistics. 5.B. Incentivize reporting of Medicaid perinatal data from every state, based on a uniform set of quality and outco me measures. 5.C. Provide resources to expand the Pregnancy Risk Assess ment and Monitoring System (PRAMS) to every state in order to monitor the health of women and infants. 5.D. Systematic use of quality measures for women and children. 5. E. Continue support for other related data syste ms. 5.F. Give priority to research into the causes and prevention of infant mortality through NIH, AHRQ, HRSA, CDC, CMS, SAMHSA, and other parts of HHS6 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 6. Strategic Direction 6: Maximi ze the pot ential of interagency, public -private, a nd multi -disciplinary c ollaboratio n. It is time for all sectors beyond public health and medicine to embrace infant mortality as \"their\" issue and strategically maximize their invest ments. For exa mple both the HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Dispariti es and the National Preve ntion Strat egy contain activities designed to improve reproductive health and birth outco mes. SAC IM believes that actions are needed at the national, state, community, family, and individual levels, and through public -private partnerships to leverage innovation, techno logy, expertise, and community assets to achieve the goal of eliminating preventable infant deaths. Recommendations : 6.A. Engage the National Prevention Coun cil and build upon the National Prevention Strategy. 6.B. Strengthen state health depart ments with effective federal -state partnerships, particularly through activities underway at HRSA, CMS, and CDC. 6.C. Maxi mize the potential of public -private partnerships, particularly by engaging private sector organizati ons which have a distinct focus on preventing infant mortality. 6.D. Engage women (daughters, mothers, and grandmothers) in efforts to prevent infant mortality, improve women's health, and strengthen family health and well-being. These SACIM recom mendations acknowledge that reducing infant mortality in the United States will require a multi-faceted effort, including practice improve ment by service providers, changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of men and women of chi ldbearing age, improved access to preve ntive and treatment services, empowered communiti es, health equity, and a serious commitment to prevention by all. SACIM believes in the vision of the United Nations \"Every Woman, Every Child\" campaign: each nation should aim to ensure that every woman and every child have the same opportunities for health and life. We know that the first years of life lay the foundation for an individual to be healthy and thrive across the life course. Families, communities, states, and the federal govern ment must work together to optimize the potential of every child. A nation as wealthy as ours can and should commit to ensuring medica l, econo mic, and social support to families sufficient to allow every baby to be born in optimal health and to enter the world wanted and loved. Anything less would fail to achieve significant and lasting improve ment. 7 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Report of the Secretary's Advisory Com mittee on Infant Mortality: Recom mendations for HHS Action and Framework for a N ational Strategy I. Background on the Prob lem of Infant Mortality Understanding Infant Mortality in the United States Infant mortality, deaths to infan ts during the first year of life (measured as the rate of infant deaths per 1000 live births), has long been under stood to be a reflection of how well a society takes care of its most vulnerable citizens. Infant mortality is a multi-factorial phen omenon, with rates reflecting a society's commitment to the provision of: high quality health care, adequate food and good nutrition, safe and stable housing, a healthy psychosocial and physical environ ment, and sufficient income to prevent impoverish ment. As such, our ability to prevent infant deaths and to address long-standing disparities in infant mortality rates between population groups is a barometer of our society's commitment to the health and well-being of all women, children and families. Because of its multifact orial nature, risk factors for infant mortality include those related to women's health prior to and during pregnancy, those related to the pregnancy experience, those associated with the birth and newborn experienc e, and those associated with the child's health and well-being in the first year of life. Thus, many points of intervention for reducing infant mortality exist, and approaches are as dispa rate as expanding access to: primary care or family planning prior to pregnancy, high-quality prenatal care, specialty treatments for preterm or sick infants, breastfeeding support and immunizations, and safe housing and healthy neighborhoods. Infant Mortality Rates and Trends The U.S. infant mortality rate has been declini ng over the past several decades, with some years of stagnation. In 2010, the reported rate was 6.15 deaths per 1,000 live births, and the provisional rate for 2011 was 6.05 per 1,000 . (See Figure 1.) The decli ne is a significant achieve ment, driven by factors such as wide availability of life saving neonatal care, increa ses in access to primary care, and better nutrition. At the same time, racial -ethnic disparities in infant mortality remain, and preventable infant deaths continue to occur. Moreover, our international ranking points to opportunit ies for further progress.8 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Rate per 1,000 live births Figure 1.

Nat ional Vital Statisti cs System. 2011 data are provisional. Prepa red for SACIM by MacDorman, November, 2012. Racial/eth nic dispa rities in infant mortality have persi sted over the last several decades and are a major reason infant mortality remains a focal public health issue. Of special concern are the very high rates of infant death among Non-Hispanic Black women (African -American), American Indian or Alaska Native, and Puerto Rican mothers. In particular, the risk of infant death for babies born to non-Hispanic black women has consistently been more than two ti mes greater than the risk of infant death for non -Hispanic white women for decades; in 2007 and 2008, the infant mortality rate for non -Hispanic black women was 2.4 ti mes the rate for non-Hispanic white women. 1 2 (See Figure 2.) Studies of the racia l/ethnic disparities in fetal, infant and maternal mortality suggest that not all race/ethnic groups have benefited equally from social and medical advances. Preterm birth (prior to 37 weeks gestation) is a factor driving disparities in infant mortality. Higher infant mortality rates for non -Hispanic black women and Puerto Rican women in the United States compared to non-Hispanic white women are largely due to higher rates of preterm birth and preterm related causes of death in these populations.3 Preterm related causes of death 9 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births account for half of the gap between non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white infant mortality rates. In 2007, 78% of the higher rates of infant mortality for Non -Hispanic black women compared to Non-Hispanic white women was att ributed to higher rates of preterm births among non-Hispanic black s; for Puerto Rican women 100% of their higher rates of infant mortality compared to non-Hispa nic whites was accounted for by higher rates of preterm birth. In contrast, among American India n/Alaska Natives, 76% of t heir higher infant mortality rates in 2007 were due to higher infant death rates at each gestation of 34 weeks or more. For A merican Indians/Alaska Natives, high rates of unintentional injuries and deaths from Sudden Infant Death Syndro me (SIDS) play a major role in infant mortality .4 5 6 Figure 2.

Hyattsville, MD: US De partment of Health and Human Servi ces, CDC, Nati onal hs/data/dat abriefs/db74.htm.10 the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Preterm birth is a major contributing factor to the overall U.S. infant mortality problem, as well as to childhood morbidity and disabilities. (See Figure 3.) The infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births for infants born at less than 32 weeks of gestation was nearly 70 times the rate for infants born at between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation.7 Children who survive have a higher risk of morbidity, including: neuro -develop mental disabilities ranging from major disorders such as cerebral palsy and mental retard ation to more subtle disorders such as language and learning proble ms, attention deficit hype ractivity disorder, and social -emotional difficulties. Preterm infants are also at increased risk for special health care needs related to health problems such as asthma.8 With preterm birth a major contributor to infant mortality in gener al, in particul ar to disparities in the United States, much of the success our nation has achieved in reducing infant mortality rates has been in keeping small infants alive rather than preventing their birth. Importantly, this approach to infant death reduction has come at great costs to our families, to our medical system, to taxpayers, and to society in general. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) esti mated that in 2005 the average direct cost of medical care for a preterm infant in the United States was more than $30,000, with the majority (85%) of this cost being incurred during the first year of life. The average cost per infant increased to $51,600 when the costs of maternal medical care, early intervention and special educat ion services, and lost household productivity were considered. The annual societal econo mic burden associated with preterm birth in the United States was in excess of $26 billion in 2005.9 These costs grow each year with medical care inflati on. Moreover, these estimates do not take into account the emotional toll on families who lose a baby or whose infant has adverse consequences. The risk factors for preterm birth (and the somewhat overlapping category of low birthweight) are not fully understood.10 In general, however, risk factors for preterm birth and low birthweight include: maternal cigarette smoking, high altitu de, poor nutritional status, low pre - pregnancy weight, low pregnancy weight gain, low or high parity, maternal low birthweight, obstetric history, mode of delivery (i.e., elective cesarean section), use of drugs or alcohol, maternal morbidity (e.g., chronic hypertension, incompetent cervix), maternal age (< 17; >34 years), multiple gestation pregnancies, infection prior to and during pregnancy, short (< 18 mos.) and long interpregnancy interval (> 60 months), stress (indi vidual and environ mental), poor social support, adverse neighborhood environ ment (physical and socia l) and poverty. Notably, neighborhood conditions are independently and significantly associated with a risk of low birth weigh t. Lack of access to quality medical care prior to and during pregnancy is also sometimes understood to be a risk factor for preterm delivery, but barriers in access to care might equally be viewed as a precurs or to the multiple health risk factors delineated above.11 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Percent preterm Figure 3.

Prep ared for SACIM by MacDorman, Novemb er, long list of risk factors for preterm birth/low birthweight clearly points to strategies which may improve pregnancy outco mes. Some of these strategies have already been shown to make a difference but are not equitably and or universally implemented in the United States, while other strategies have not been thorough ly tested, may improve outco mes but not affect disparities, may have individual but not popula tion impact, or requi re extensive resources within and beyond the medical care system and public health syste ms. As we consider strategies below, these conside rations will be addressed. This listing of risk factors for preterm birth/low birthweight also points to some major themes with respe ct to intervention: the importance of action across generations and across the life course, the importance of wo men's health before, during and after pregnancy, the importance of community and environ mental health, and the importance of psychosocial -econo mic factors in maternal and infant health and well-being. 12 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 \"Preterm birth is a co mplex cluster of pr oblems with a set of overlapping factors of influence.

Preterm Birth. 2006, page 2. In 2010, the U.S. ranked 27th in infant mortality compared to other natio ns in the Organization for Econo mic Cooperation and Develop ment (OECD). (See Figure 4.) The U.S. infant mortality rate is higher than the industri alized country average of 5 per 1,000 live births and is greater than the infant mortality rates in most of Western Europe, Canad a, Israel, and Japan. Parti cularly worriso me is that the U.S. rank among nations in the OECD group has consistently dropped since 1960 when the United States ranked 12th. By 1980 the US ranked 19th, dropping to 30th in 2005 and then 27th in 2010. Diffe rences in how live births are recorded in the OECD nations may affect some of the comparisons; however, researc hers at the Natio nal Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), CDC, HHS do not report this to be a main cause of our low ranking. Better explanations for the differential in infant mortality rates between the United States and other OECD nations are differences across these nations in rates of preterm and low birthweight births and persistent racial/ ethnic disparities in U.S. infant mortality.11 The CDC esti mated that if the United States had the same distribution of births by gestational age as Sweden, then 8,000 U.S. infant deaths would be averted each year and our natio n's infant mortality rate would be one- third lower than current rates.12 Looking globally, the United States - along with Brazil, India, and Nigeria - is among the ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births .13 14 15 13 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Figure 4.

Prepared by MacDor man for SACIM, Nove mber 2012. Importantly, although we emphasize preterm birth, other major causes of death in the first year of life include congenital malformations, Sudd en Infant Death Syndro me (SIDS, now expanded to include Sudden Unexpected Infant Death - SUID), maternal complications, and unintentional injuries. More than half of infant deaths are attributable to these five leading causes .16 (See Figure 5.) One in 33 infants is born with a congenital malformation (also known as birth defects), and one in five infant deaths is due to a congenital malformation. Rates of birth defects contribute to preterm and low birthweight birth rates and they share some risk factors .17 18 Some birth defects can be prevented with ensuring adequate nutrition before and during pregnancy, (particularly folic acid supple mentation prior to pregnancy), ensuring women with diabetes are in good glyce mic control before and during pregnancy, maintaining or achieving a healthy pre-pregnancy 15 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 body mass index (healthy weight), ensuring adequate pregnancy intervals, and avoidance of alcohol, tobacco, and certain terato genic drugs and medications. 19 20 21 22 While most deaths resulting from preterm birth and congenital malformations occur in the neonat al period (deaths within the first 28 days of life), some other causes of infant mort ality \u2014 particul arly SIDS/SUID, inju ries, diarrhea, homicide, septice mia, and influenza/pneumonia \u2014 are more likely to manifest in the postneonatal period (deaths between 28 days and one year). (See Figure 6.) For so me groups, including Native American and Alaskan Native infants, postneonatal mortality rates are particularly high.23 Widening gaps in socio -econo mic conditions and health behaviors also may be a factor .24 Thus, unequal treatment, social determinants of health, and inequities associated with postneonatal mortality also are a factor in the overall racial-ethnic disparities in infant mortality. Of particul ar conc ern is that many of the leading causes of postneon atal mortality are considered preventable. Some effective interve ntions that make a difference in postneonatal mortality are well-known but not sufficiently and/or universally implemented in the United States at this time, including breastfeeding, immunizations, safe sleep (to prevent SIDS/SUID), f amily planning, immunizations, and WIC nutrition supple ments. Having a pediatric medical home can support the efforts of families to prote ct their infant's health and development. Other interve ntions that also directly affect infant/child health and well-being independent of an infant's health status at birth are socioecono mic and psychosocial supports that allow parents to properly care and provide for their infants and children, included in key home visiting program models. Assuring the safety of infants is critical to their survival; no infant should die as a result of an accidental injury, preventable infection, child maltreat ment, or ho micide. 16 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Rate per 100,000 live births Figure 6.

Given the facts and description of the problem here described we are making recom mendations to the Secretary to guide develop ment of an HHS action plan and a public -private national strategy to reduce infant mortality between now and 2015. 17 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 II. Principles for a national s trategy on infant mortali ty In June, 2012, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius made a commitment to the development of the natio n's first national strategy to reduce infant mortality. This is a historic commitment and, consistent with its charter, the Secretary's Advisory Com mittee on In fant Mortality (SACIM) is prepared to assist with and guide the develop ment of such a national strategy. This SACIM report, based on the views of experts empaneled for 2011 -2012, makes recom mendations to serve as the framework for the Secretary, HHS age ncies, and the entire federal govern ment as they define and implement an official federal action plan. This is consistent with our charter, which calls for SAC IM to report to the Secretary and to advise on HHS activities and programs that are directed at reducing infant mortality and improving the health status of pregn ant women and infants. In 2013, SACIM can assist in the develop ment of a public -private national strategy to reduce infant mortality. Our c harter also calls for S ACIM to provide advice on how best to coordinate federal, state, and local govern ment progra ms, as well as private sector resources and activities. SACIM is designed to represent \"a public-private partnership at the highest level\". Our membership includes 21 private sector exper ts from medicine (ob-gyn, pediatrics, family medicine), nursing, public health, epide miology, consu mer advocacy, health policy, and other fields. The ex-officio members represent 12 uni ts of federal govern ment including six health agencies, as well as the Depart ments of Education (DOE), Labor (DOL), Housing and Urban Develop ment (HUD), Agriculture (USDA), and Administration for Children and Families (ACF) SACIM recommends that we be designated as the entity that will fa cilitate de velopment of a public -private natio nal strategy to reduce infant mortality . This national strategy would include both public and private sector strategies. This report focuses on recommendations for HHS action. It is intended to guide an HHS a ction plan and to serve as a framework for the nation al strategy to reduce infant mortality. 18 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 \"...in the U.S. we've s een our infant mor tality rat es steadily decli ne.

I'm pleased to ann ounce my departm ent will be collaborating in the next year to create our nation 's first ever natio nal strategy to address infa nt mortality.\" HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Ju ne 14, 2012 SACIM believes strongly that the nation should set objectives that reflect a strong commi tment to reducing infant mortality. In 2010, the U.S. infant mortality rate was 6.15 deaths per 1,000 live births, and the average for industrialized countries was 5. The Healthy People 2020 objective is set at 6.0 per 1,000. Figure 7 shows how continued progress at an average annual decline of 3.1 percent could yield greater progress. Based on recent trends, ho wever, SACIM recommends that the t argets should by fifteen\" and \"four -five by twenty\" - that is, the United States should aim to reduce the infant mortality to 5.5 per 1000 by 2015, and to 4.5 by 2020 .

Presented by Lu to SACIM, July, 2012.19 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 We know that reducing infant mortality will require a multi-faceted, comprehensi ve national strategy. We also know that simply making better use of effecti ve services and progra ms will make a difference. Archimedes, in asserting the principle of leverage, is quoted as saying: \"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on whi ch to place it, and I shall move the world .\" We have the lever of resol ve to eliminate infant mortality. We need to use the fulcrum made up of existing policies, progra ms, and practices in order to move the world. Effectively and efficiently leveraging existing resources and knowledge will be the primary route to further reducing the in fant mortality rate of our nation. It is also clear that we cannot close the infant mortality gap with medical care alone. More population -based public health and prevention efforts and greater investments in health equity will be needed. Both the National Prevention Plan and the work of the Surgeon Gener al's Prevention Council include key strategies to improve the health of wo men, infants, families, and communities. Many of strategies discussed in this SACIM r eport can also be found in the National Prevention Strategy and the HHS Acti on Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities; many others are based on provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Any plan or strategy to reduce infant mortality should be grounded in a set of core principles. The following core principles were defined by SACIM to guide the recommendations in this report. We belie ve that to be effective, a multi-faceted strategy to reduce infant mortality shoul d: Reflect a life course perspective Engage and empower consu mers Reduce inequity and disparities and ameliorate the negative effects of key social deter minants Advance system coordination and service integration Prote ct the existing maternal and child health safety net programs Leverage change throu gh multi-sector, public and private collaboration Define actionable strategies that emphasize prevention and are continually infor med by evidence and measurement. Reflecting a life course perspective . While all of the factors driving adverse birth outco mes and infant mortality are not understood, the Instit ute of Medicine and other experts have identified risks that can be addressed now, with current knowledge.25 Success will require a continuum of services starting before pregnancy, continuing with appropriate and high-quality prenatal and birth services, and addressing the needs of wo men and infants after the birth. (See figures in Appendices A and B which show the major service components needed in this continuu m.) 20 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Over the past fifty years, progress in reducing infant mortality has lar gely been the result of saving babies born too soon or too small. The success of regionalizati on of neonatal care and perinatal services was i nstrumental in the major decli nes in infant mortality since the 1970s. In fact, greater adherence to the successful practices of regionalized perinat al care could contribute to lower infant and maternal morbidity and mortality .26 Building more prevention efforts onto our nation's outstanding capacity to save preterm and low birthweight babies is the next frontier. For decades, prenatal care has been a primary national strate gy for reducing infant mortality. Prenatal care offers the opportun ity to identify maternal risk factors, particularly those that emerge during pregnancy. Prenatal visits are a process, thro ugh which evidence -based and infor med practices can be matched to a woman's health and pregnancy conditions. Interventions to promote smoking cessation, identification of gestational diabetes, linkage to needed social services or specialty care, and education on he althy weight and nutrition are just a few of the advantages conferred by prenatal care. Providing prenatal care that begins early, continues throughout pregnancy, and is tailored to needs is recom mended .27 28 29 30 Inadequate amounts of care, not even accounti ng for the quality of care, has been associated with increased risk of prematurity, stillbirth, and infant death.31 Prenat al care is important; yet for many families, prenatal care comes too late to reduce risks, complications, or deaths among mothers and babies .32 33 34 And, most birth defects occur in the first few weeks of pregnancy, typically before the first prenatal visit and thus too late for key birth defects prevention opportuniti es. Experts now recognize that to improve birth outco mes, we must first improve women's health before pregnancy, prior to conception. National recom mendations call for pro motion of preconception health and health care to further reduce infant mortality .35 Effective, evidence -based services have been identified. 36 37 In 2008, prior to the ACA health refor ms, policy experts recommended: 1) coverage for adult women, 2) preventive services, including family planning and preconception care, without cost sharing; 3) patient protections (e.g. confidentiality and guaranteed issue); and 4) interconception care to women with a prior adverse pregnancy outco me in Medicaid .38 Since 2005, the CDC, in partnership with a coalition of public and private partners, has led a national movement to improve preconception health and health care.39 The Office of Minority Health also has launched a campaign to promote women's preconception health through peer education in communiti es of color. The life course perspective is a way of looking at life not as disconnected stages, but as an integrated continuum of events and interactions.40 New science has led to increasing recognition of how the health of a woman before conception can affect the outco me of pregnancy, and that the health and development of an infant can affect well-being throughout a lifeti me. There is growing scientific understanding of the intera ctions among biologic, genetic, psychosocial, and environ mental factors and their effect on pregnancy outco mes and lifelong health. 41 42 (See 21 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Figure 7.) In addition, research suggests that many chronic childhood diseases such as asth ma, autis m, and obesity, as well as chr onic adult diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are influenced by what happens at the start of life from conception through the early childhood years .43 44 45 SACIM recognizes the importance of using a life course perspective to understand health and human develop ment, particularly in the case of wo men and infants. Science tells us that a lifeti me of opti mal health and human developme nt begins in the \"first 1,000 days\" from the prenatal period through the first two years. Figure 7.

Engaging and empowering consumers . SACIM believes that the national strategy to reduce infant mortality should use a patient -centered approach and engage, empower, and activate mothers, families, and the broad er community in the prevention of infant mortality. Evidence suggests that better outcomes will be the result. 22 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Patient centeredness has beco me widely recogniz ed as a key component of high quality health care. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) repo rt on Crossing the Quality C hasm defined patient - centered care as \"respectful of and responsive to individual patient prefe rences, needs and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions. \"46 To this end, achieving patient - centered care calls for action with, and not just for, the mother, family and community. Mothers generally have important influence on the health and health care decisions of families. This includes decisions about pregnancy, nutriti on, family safety, and when to seek health care. Fathers also have an important role to play in childbearing and influence child and family health outco mes and well-being. Engaging and infor ming parents is essential to improving the health and survival of infants. For exa mple, parents must be effectively informed about and act on their knowledge about prevention strategies that can reduce the incidence of SIDS, injuries, and vaccine -preventable diseases. Professionals must understand parents perspecti ves and barriers to effective imple mentati on of prevention strategies. SACIM believes that mobilizing and harnes sing the \"expe riential wisdom\" of mothers, families and broader community across t he entire spectrum of patient engage ment \u2014 from empowering, infor ming and activating mothers, to partnering in the design of innovative care models and initiatives \u2014 will result in greater relevan ce, enhanced service utilization, and ultimately better outco mes for mothers, infants, and families. \"It is time to refoc us, reinf orce, a nd repeat the mess age that health disparities e xist and that heal th equity ben efits everyone .\" HHS S ecretary Kathleen Sebeli us, HHS Action Plan to Re duce R acial a nd Ethnic H ealth D isparitie s, page. 1 Reducing inequity, health disparities and the negative effects social determinant s. It has been said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing in the same way and expecting a different result. When W.E.B. Dubois pointed out that the health of the black population in the U.S. was worse than that of the white populat ion in 1899, he would no doubt have expected that by now we would have made the moral commitment, defin ed the resources, and demonstrated the political will to eliminate the racial gap in adverse birth outcomes, infant mortality, and maternal mortality. In 2012, howe ver, the two-to-three -fold racial gap in these adverse outco mes is as real today as it has been over the past decades. Addressing the racial and econ omic inequity, unequal treatment, and social deter minants that drive dispa rities in infant and maternal 23 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 mortality, as well as birth outco mes overall, must be a priority in any national plan to reduce infant mortality. Advancing system coordination and service integration . Currently, services for fa milies are a patchwork at best, pieced togeth er by communities and families from a set of discr ete federal/state funding strea ms and categorical progra ms. A family that needs an array of services (e.g., Medicaid coverage, medical care, mental health treatment to combat maternal postpartum depression, family planning, early intervention services to assure opti mal infant develop ment, and nutriti on supple ments from WIC) often has to apply for eligibility under different progra ms, and identify and visit several provider sites. Many families fall through the cracks where there are large system gaps. Well -coordinated and integrated service systems are the exception rather than the norm in large and small, urban and rural communities across the country. The Institute of Medicine has ca lled for gre ater integration of public health and primary care in particular .47 Whereas public health is designed to fulfill \"society's interest in assuring the conditions in which people can be healthy \"48 and primary health care has a similar goal, they can and should be mutually supportive and integrated components of a health system designed to improve the health of populations. This work will require leadership and partn erships. Partn erships between federal, state, and local agencies, private providers and safety net clinics, and communities are needed. Within HHS, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have missions focused on improving health and have particularly important roles to play in advancing system coordination and service integration. Specifically, the HRSA Mater nal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) is the only agency whose mission includes improving the health of all women, infants, children, and their families, including fathers. Partnerships are a key strategy within the mission of MCHB. The Institute of Medicine also has e mphasized the importance of community engage ment in defining and addressing population health. In addition, innovative health care delivery strategies such as the medical home, accountable care organizations, and community health teams are underway in some areas of the country, but they are not widespread or close to universally avail able. Home visiting progra ms are serving as a means to connect families to services but only a small fraction of those families in need and at- risk are being served. SACIM beli eves that the nation al strategy to reduce infant mortality should make use of these and other approaches and incentives to increase system coordination and service integration. 24 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 \"What we n eed is m ore integrati on - vertical, hor izontal, and longi tudinal. integrati leve ls of care; h orizontal integration in ter ms of service coordination not o nly within heal thcare but across syst ems - schoo ls, social services, child welfare, a nd com munity p rograms; and longitudi nal integration in terms of cont inuum of care across the life co urse.\" M ichael Lu, M.D., Associate Administrator for Mater nal and Child Health, HRSA, SACIM Meeting, July 10, 2012. Protecting key federal i nvestments that make up the \"mater nal and child health safety net,\" inclu ding programs such as the Medicaid program, Title V Mater nal and Child Health Services (MCH) Block Grant; Title X Family Planning; Community Health Centers; Healthy Start; Mater nal, Infant, and Childho od Home Visiting (MIECHV) progra m; and WIC Supple mental Nutrition Progra m. SACIM believes that cuts in these programs would be detrimental to any national strategy to reduce infant mortality. Prior to enact ment of the ACA an estimated 40-50% of U.S. births were financed by Medicaid . With implementation of ACA, Medicaid will beco me an even more important source of coverage, especially for wo men of childbearing age. Since the mid-1980s, Medicaid coverage expansions have increased access to care for pregnant women and infants. Today, at the federal and state level s, Medicaid is leading efforts to improve the quality of a continuum of services including prenatal care, birth, newborn care, postpartum visits, interconception care, and well-baby visits. Yet variations in coverage and benefits have impeded access and quality. The Title V MCH Block Gra nt has been at the heart of our natio n's infant mortality reduction efforts for more than 75 years. Using approxi mately $500 million in federal funds, states leverage more than $6 billion to support the essential infrastructure at the nation al, state, and local level for the delivery of MCH services such as immunizations. Since its inception, Title V has served as the incubator for innov ation in MCH services, seeding new approaches and progra ms and then working with public and private partners to ensure widespread and effective imple mentation. The creation of regional perinatal syste ms of neonat al intensive care units (NICUs), newborn screening progra ms, and syste ms of care for chil dren with speci al health care needs are prime examples. The Mater nal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiti ng (MIECHV) program, created through the ACA, makes grants to states to deliver evidence -based interventions to high-risk pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children in home and 25 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 community settings. Several of the HHS -approved MIECHV program models have demonstrat ed success in improving birth outcomes and reducing infant mortality (among other outcomes), and these models are being replicated in high-need communities across the country. The Title X Family Planning program assures access to family planning education and services for millions of wo men, particularly low-income and young women. Sixty perce nt of the women using Title X clinics consi der these clinics their usual source of care. Each year, Title X prevents 973,000 un intended pregnancies. This is important because unintended pregnancies are highly correlated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including low birthweight, preterm birth, and infant mortality. Community Health Centers (CHCs, also known as Feder ally Qualified Health Centers - FQHCs - under Medicaid and Medicare) provide services to more than 20 million patients each year in medically underserved areas. CHCs provide the care associated with more than 17% of the births to low-income families. CHCs provide comprehensive primary care, inclu ding family planning, prenatal care, and infant care in communities that are otherwise medically underserved. Data show that where CHCs serve more low- income individuals in a state, the state's African-American/ white and Hispanic/white health disparities decline in such k ey areas as prenatal care and infant mortality rates. While HHS does not oversee the Su pplement al Nutrition Program for Women, Infants & Children (W IC) progra m, the collab orative relati onship betw een HHS and USDA to support the program is importan t, and in communities, WIC is closely integrated with other maternal and child health services. Each year, WIC reaches more than 2 million pregnant and postpa rtum women plus 2 million infants and nearly 5 million young chil dren with nutriti on counseling and food. Studies have shown that WIC is associated with reduced rates of low birthwei ght, a major precurs or of infant mortality Leveraging through interagency, public -private, and multi -disci plinary collaboration and partnershi ps. The American tradition is to achieve greatness through public -private collab oration and partnerships. Current efforts to reduce infant mortality have been stimulated by the ideas and action of non -profit organizations, state and local health depart ments, health professional associations, community -based organizations, acade mic institutions, and federal govern ment agencies. Indeed, the composition of SACIM reflects this array of stakeholders. In terms of federal leadership, no one agency has the means and authority to undertake all that is recom mended in this report. We strongly believe that the national strategy to reduce infant mortality must leverage public and private resources, promote further collaboration, and stimulate synergy. 26 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Defining actionable strategies that emphasi ze prevention and are continually informed by evidence a nd measuremen t. The SACIM recommendations to guide the Secretary and HHS in develop ment of the national public -private strategy and an HHS official action plan to reduce infant mortality focus on action, effective practices, and opportunities for both short - and long- term succes s. Too many reports and plans are more focused on descri bing the problem or setting out principles than on actionable strategies. This report focus es on actions we believe can be adopted in the next 3-5 years by HHS in partnership with other federal agencies, state and local govern ments, and private sector organizations and leaders. 27 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 III. Strategic Directions for Reduc ing Infant Mortality: Six Big Ideas SACIM proposes six strategic directions or \"big ideas\". These strategic directions define key areas for action and each incorporates specific SACIM rec ommended strate gies and activities. We believe that HHS should take action in each of these six strate gic directions and have made specific recommendations for each. Note that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides opportunities within each area. In addition, many actio ns recommended by SACIM require a change in approach rather than new invest ment or increased budgetary commi tments. Strategic Direction 1. Improve the Health of Women Before, During, and Beyond Pregnancy The Obama Administration has given unprecede nted attention to improving the health of wo men and girls through a variety of poli cies and initiatives. Continued emphasis is needed, particularly attention to the implementation of key policies and progra ms. SACIM strongly believes that the Patient Protection and Affor dable Care Act (ACA) offers major opportunities to further reduce infant mortality in the United States. This is particularly true in terms of improving the health of wo men. (A sum mary of SACIM list of opportunities to use the ACA for purposes of reducing infant mortality can be found in Appendix C.) An esti mated one in five women of childbear ing age (15-44 years) was uninsured in 2008 -09 and others were underinsured, without coverage for needed service s. Women at highest risk for being uninsured include those who are: low inco me, young, single, and without high school completion. Women who are neither pregnant nor raising children are particularly likely to be uninsured and generally do not qualify for Medicaid. Young adults 19 to 24 years were the most likely age group to be uninsured prior to passa ge of the ACA and are among those most likely to have pregnancies .49 50 Nearly 9 out of 10 wo men 18-64 years report using some health care services and having some health expenses during a year.51 Fewer uninsured, low-income, less educated, and Hispanic women report using any health services. More than half of uninsu red women ages 18-65 reported going without or dela ying needed care because they could not afford the cost.52 In addition, millions of wo men qualify for Medic aid only during pregnancy and do not have coverage for pri mary and preventive well-woman visits and preconception care.53 A smaller number of wo men have adverse pregnancy outco mes and go without \"interconception\" (also known as \"interpregnancy) care specifically designed to address risk factors and prevent a subsequent adverse pregnancy outco me.54 55 28 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 ACA will provide coverage to millions of uninsured women, which creates an extraordinary opportunity to improve women's health not only during pregnancy, but before, between and beyond pregnancy .56 57 58 59 The ACA a ims to provide affordable coverage for all, with subsidies to those whose inco me is less than 400 percent of poverty (roughly $43,320). Increased coverage during the reproductive years could increase access to a range of services and, in turn, improve both the health of wo men and the outcomes of any pregnancies they may choose to have. Recomme ndation s: 1.A. Monitor coverage and promote use of women's clinical preventi ve services. The ACA p rovides an ideal opportunity to promote use of clinical preventive services for women. In August, 2012, an estimated 47 million women gained greater contr ol over their health care and access to eight prevention -related health care services. Of great importance is increased access to well woman visits, inclu ding prenatal and preconception care, without cost sharing, which can reduce risks prior to and during pregnancy. The other preventive services in the new HHS guidelines for women's preventive services (i.e., screening for gestational diabetes, HPV DNA testing, domestic violence screening and counseling, HIV screening and counseling for sexually trans mitted infectio ns, breastfeeding supplies, contraceptive methods and family planning counseling) are also important for improving women's health and reducing infant mortality. \"Defin ing ap propriate preventive services for wo men and e nsuring that those services can be acc essed without cost sha ring are important strategies to i mprove women's health and wel l-being.... F urthermore, mounting ev idence su ggest that women not only h ave different health care ne eds th en mend (beca use of reproductive differe nces) but also manifest different symptoms and responses to treatment modalities. Behavioral fact ors that are shown to c ontribute to morbidity and mortality in wo men, include s moking, eating habi ts, phys ical activity, alcohol use. Pregna ncy and childbirth also carry risks to wo men's health i ncluding maternal mortality. (IOM, 2011, pa ge 1 29 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 1.B. Partner with professionals to develop clinical guid elines for well-woman visits. To ensure effective implementation of the federal policy guidelines for coverage with no cost sharing, SACIM recom mends that the HRSA Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) partner with the American College of Obste tricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Am erican Acade my of Physicians (AAFP), A merican College of Nurse Midwives (ACNM), Association of Women's Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) and other professionals to develop clinical guidelines for providers of well woman visits, including specific guidance for preconception care. The Mikulski \"Women's Health Amendment\" calls for HRSA to develop such guidelines, and a partnership with providers would enhance their credibility and likelihood of their use. Such an effort would build upon the successful approaches MCHB used in creating Bright Fut ures for Child ren in collaboration with the American Acade my of Pediatrics (AAP). It could parallel and complement the longstanding success of ACOG and AAP in issuing Guidelines for Perinatal Care, which was just released in its seventh edition.60 Next year, 2013 is the opportune time to develop a guideline docu ment and tools to support its the implementation in well woman visits. This work would support i mplementation of the HHS policy guidelines on wo men's clinical preventive services coverage and should be grounded in the Institute of Medicine (IOM ), ACOG's clinical guideline and opinion series, and the report on the content of preconception care for wo men of reproductive age.61 Experts would be convened to represent various organizations and perspectives on practice. The resulting clinical guideline would be widely disse minated. Federal leadership can be the force for convening an array of providers and building on the available science. We believe that no one professional organization will be able to convene and lead this work as effectively as HRSA -MCHB. 1.C. Use Medicaid in novation, demonstrations, and flexibility to offer states new avenues for delivering effective, evidence -based inter ventions to women. Use the Center for Me dicare and Medicaid Innovations to demonstrate the effective - ness of new care model s. The Strong Start grant opportunity to evaluate the effect of enhanced prenatal care is an important step which SACIM supports. At the same time, more must be done. Future innovations grants projects - perhaps additional phases of Strong Start - could demonstrate approaches that span the continuum from family planning through pregnancy and birth to 24 months of interconception care for low - income, high-risk women and infants. Innovat ion Grant Challenge projects also should include efforts aimed at improved quality in newborn and regional perinatal care. 30 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Support States' use of Medica id health homes for women of childbearing age with chronic co nditions . For wo men of childbearing age, such projects might aim to provide an effective, patie nt-centered medical home for wo men with two or more chronic conditions (e.g., asthma, obesity, diabetes, substance use disorder, mental health conditions). Each of these conditions increases risk for an adverse birth outco me. Encourage and permit states to finance interconception/ interpregn ancy care in Medicaid . In 2011, Georgia implemented the first Medicaid waiver to focus on interconception care building on a successful Atlanta project. Louisiana has launched an interpregna ncy care waiver project in high-risk areas of New Orleans .62 Other states are seeking State Plan Amendments and CMS approval for projects that do not require waivers. Permitting state action now can help inform Medicaid cove rage expansions in 2014 and beyond.63 Require that states cover the HHS approved women's cli nical pre ventive ser vices to women enrolled in Medicaid without cost sh aring. While millions of privately and newly insured women will have no-cost cove rage for the clinical preventive services discussed above, the HHS guidelines do not apply to women with traditional Medicaid coverage. This omission in the ACA should be corrected by HHS. Every state Medicaid agency should be required to provide cover age for clinical preventive services without cost sharing. Continue to give states flexi bility in design of family p lanning waivers and state plan amendments which emphas ize prevention, well-woman c are, and preconception health. The ACA w omen's clinical preventive services coverage without cost sharing will increase access to family planning servi ces. In addition, however, Medicaid policy should continue to support access to family planning services. Medicaid has beco me one of the largest sources of financing for family planning services delivered to low-income women. As Medicaid is expanded, coverage for family planning should be ensured. 1.D. Increase eff orts to ensure access to men tal/behavio ral health a nd social su pport services for women. Depression, anxiety, stress, and other psychosocial factors affect the health of wo men and their pregnancy outco mes.64 65 Interventions \u2014 including individual clinical treatment and community -based strategies \u2014 exist to addre ss these psych osocial risks. Increased social support and resilience also can mediate the impact of psychosocial risk factors .66 67 68 Depression is widespread, particularly among low-income women. Parental depression and related disorders contribute to adverse pregn ancy outco mes and infant morbidity and mortality, 31 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 and there are challenges in selecting the most appropriate clinical manage ment course for depression during pregnancy to optimize maternal health and minimize fetal risk. As many as 15 million children, or one out of every five, live with an adult who had major depre ssion in the past year.69 An U rban Institute study, which for the first time uses a national dataset to look at maternal depression, showed a strikingly high rate of depression. One in nine infants in poor f amilies (i.e., living below the federal poverty level) has a mother reporti ng severe depression symptoms.70 More than half of all infants in poor families have mothers reporting some form of depression, including mild and moderate depression symptoms.71 Moreover, maternal depression frequently coincides with other conditions and risk factors, including other mental health diagnoses, substance abuse, chronic medical conditions, and domestic violence. Unfortunately, while maternal depression can be treated effectively with medication, psychotherapy, behavioral, or other therapy, many low-income women do not receive such interventions .72 73 74 While brief scree ning tools are available for pri mary care and other settings, lack of health coverage and limited availability of providers have been longstanding barriers to treatment for postpartu m/maternal depression and anxiety.75 Domestic violence and interper sonal violence (DV/IPV) also place women and infants at risk. Pregnant women who experience DV/IPV are at risk for personal harm and increased risk adverse pregnancy outco mes. DV/IPV is associa ted with: inadequate prenatal care, physic al trauma, stress, depression,76 other high risk behaviors (e.g., substance abuse, tobacco use). DV/IPV is also associated with an elevated risk of ho micide as a cause of maternal death.77 Some studies show an increased risk for p reterm and low birthweight births among women exposed to DV/IPV .78 Substance abuse is another behavioral health factor related to women's health, pregnancy outco mes, and infant mortality. The incidence of substance abuse in pregnancy is estimated to be 15% to 20% in some communities and is associated with higher risks of preterm birth and infant mortality .79 Screening and treatment for substance abuse during pregnancy is important for reducing the impact on mother and infant. As substance abuse a chronic relapsing disorder, the goal should be to provide treatment and related interventions sufficient to reduce the impact of substance abuse on pregnancy and the first years of life when a child's safety, security, attach ment, and brain develop ment are funda mental to health and well-being for a lifeti me. For example, substance abuse case manage ment or home visiting models can connect pregnant women and new mothers to treatment, improve parenting skills, and protect the safety of an infant. 32 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 \"Biomedical risks, s uch as complications of pregn ancy, conco mitant maternal disease, exposure to terat ogens, are est imated to account for appr oximately one have of the incid ence of low -birth-weight infants and of pre maturity and the ir post natal s equell ae.

HSS should: Fully fund and implement the provisions of the ACA related to postpartum depression and psychosis, including researc h, grants to states, and public education campaigns . The ACA calls for \"to continue activities on po stpartum [conditions ]...including research to expand the understanding of the causes of, and treatments for, postp artum conditio ns.\" Use the resources of t he Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administr ation (SA MHSA) to in crease kno wledge of and access to appropriate screening and treatment for me ntal and behavioral he alth conditio ns affecting women of childbearing age, before, during, and beyond pregnancy. Monitor c overage for and use of DV/IPV screening and counseling as part of t he federal g uidelines f or women's clinical preventive ser vices. Give priority to the de velopment of research and services to reduce substance use among women of childbearing age through NIH and SAMHSA . Encourage states to use Community Trans formation Grants (CTGs) to address the chronic di sease ri sks and needs of women of childbearing age. Without specific direction related to maternal and child health, many grant ees have not partnered or focused on wo men of reproductive age and/or children. More explicit guidance to states is needed, especially related behav ioral health and psychosocial issues. 33 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Strategic Direction 2. Ensure access to a continuum of safe and high -quality, patient -centered care. Assuring the safety and quality of services for pregnant women and infants throughout the first year of life is a fundamental and essential strategy. Currently, federal and state initiatives, as well as projects in select hospitals and health systems demonstrate what can and should be done. Still, unequal treatment by race/et hnicity, income, and type of coverage has been a persistent proble m. Across communities and providers, there is wide variation in applying the best evidence and delivering best practice. In other words, we have far to go toward assuring that all women and infants receive quality care as defined by the Institute of Medicine, that is, safe, timely, effective, efficie nt, equitable, and patient -centered.80 There are missed opportunities for reducing infant mortality and adverse birth outco mes through high-quality maternal and infant services that focus on preve ntive service s, chronic conditions, and mental and behavioral health before, during and after pregnancy. Enhanced and individualized prenatal care is critical. More pregnant women and infants should benefit from birth -related services in a risk-appropriate facility. Prevention efforts should not stop at birth. Quality improve ment projects, public and private, are needed to fill the gaps between what we know and what gets done (e.g., elimination of ea rly elective deliveries, appropriate use of progesterone for prevention of preterm birth, screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria or GBS, promotion of smoking cessation, safe sleep or breastfeeding, reducing of central -line associated bloodstream infections in newborns, etc.). Better care can lead to better outco mes and lower costs. For women of childbearing age and infants, as for other populations, the United States can achieve a high-value, high-perfo rmance health system by pursuing the \"triple aim\", that is, simultaneously aiming to improve individual experience of care; improve the health of populat ions; and reduce the per capita costs of care for populations .81 Recomme ndation s: 2.A. Strengthen state leadership and capacity to improve birth outcomes and reduce infant mortality through HRSA's Collaborative In novation and Improvement Net work (COIIN). Building on mo mentum generated by state health officers, the March of Dimes, and other leaders in13 southern states which had developed state plans to reduce infant mortality, HRSA -MCHB has launched a Collaborative Improve ment and Innovation Network (COIIN) to reduce infant mortality in the 13 Southern States of Regions IV and VI. The COIIN builds on the success of the Infant Mortality Summit held in January 2012, at which the 13 states in Public Health Regions IV and VI developed plans to reduce infant mortality. In response, HRSA -MCHB, in 34 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 partnership with the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), the March of Dimes, CityMatCH, Association of Mater nal and Child Health Progra ms (AMCHP), as well as Federal partners including the Centers for D isease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Centers for Medicare & Medic aid Services (CMS), launc hed the COIIN to facilitate collaborative learning and adoption of proven quality improve ment principles and practices across these 13 states to reduce infant mortality and improve birth outco mes. Five shared priority strategies were defined in the southern states. The current five COIN strategies are: 1) eliminating elective deliv eries prior to 39 weeks gestat ion; 2) prenatal smoking cessation; 3) safe sleep for inf ants; 4) Medicaid financed interconce ption care for wo men with a prior adverse pregnancy outco me; and 5) strengthened regional perinatal care syste ms. Each of these COIIN strategies links to other nation al public and private initiative s, as well as to the recom mendations elsewhere in this report. Multi -state teams, supported by ex perts, have formed around each of the five strategies. More than two hundred committed professionals from the Southern States are volunteering their time and expertise to the COIIN. Together, these leaders are focusing on ways to ensure health equity, eliminate health disparities, and implement best progra ms, policies, and practices to reduce infant mortality. Plans are underway to expand the Infant Mort ality COIIN Initi ative nationwide. Discussions have already begun in the Midwest (Region V) whose states attended the meeting in July, 2012 as observers and learners. The Mid-Atlantic (Region III) s tates also have begun planning. Notable, additional regions are discu ssing additi onal strategies (e.g., focus of health, breastfeeding). SACIM recom mends that -MCHB to contin ue the infant mortality COIIN initiative, which engages federal, state, and local leaders, public and private agencies, professionals and communities in advancing priority strategies for reducing infant mortality and improving maternal, infant, and family health. Resources should also be sufficient to support disse mination and spread of best practices. 2.B. Use Medicaid to drive quality and improve the health of women and infants. As mentioned above, even prior to enact ment of the ACA, an estimated 40-50% of U.S. births were financed by Medicaid. With imple mentation of ACA, Medicaid will beco me an even more important source of coverage for wo men and infan ts. We believe that Medicaid provides the single most important lever HHS has to improve birth outco mes and infant survival for low - income families.82 Becau se it is a large payer, changes in Medicaid maternal and infant policy can, in turn, affect the quality of care received by families with other sources of health coverage. 35 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 The Strong Start for Mothers and Newborns launched by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) is an important first step. The Strong Start initiative supports reducing the risk of significant complications and long- term health proble ms for both expectant mothers and newborns. Strong Start's two strategies could each be used to reduce infant mort ality beyond the current focus on prenatal care. One Strong Start strategy is a public -private partnership to increase public and professional awareness of the risks associated with elective deliveries prior to 39 weeks gestation. This work should be continued. A subsequent campaign might focus on increasing public awareness of the warning signs of serious illness or complica tions among pregnant women and infants (as discussed below). The other Strong Start strategy is a funding opportun ity for testing new approaches to care. In 2012, this funding was focused on prenatal care. Prenatal care was a good place to begin expanding our knowledge about what works in Medicaid to improve birth outco mes. Understanding the role of group care and other prenatal enhance ments is important. But, prenatal care is only one part of the continuum of services that help mothers and babies have optimal health and outco mes. SACIM believes that additional CMMI fund ing opportunities, perhaps as subsequent phases of Strong Start, should be used to address other key facets of infant mortality prevention , including but not limited to: approaches to strengthen regional perinatal care syste ms enhanced approaches to interco nception care for wo men who have had a prior adverse pregnancy outco me financed by Medicaid, particularly those with chronic diseases improved methods for hospital discharge planning and transitions to community care, especially for infants with special health care needs and for skills support of mothers who are breastfeeding appropriate services for low -risk wo men attended at birth by nurse -midwives innovation in screening and treatment for maternal depression and related mental disorders. SACIM also recommends that CMS, partic ularly CMMI, use it re sources to e ncourage testing and expansion of innovative models for service coordination and systems integration . This might include projects focused on improving services for wo men and infants through \"integrated care models\", which include medical/health home, accountable care organizations (ACO), ACO -like models, and other arrange ments that emphasize patient - centered, continuous, coordinated, and comprehensive care. In the community, approaches include: accountable care communities, community-based collaborative care networks, community health teams, patient navigators. CMS has offered guidance to states in designing 36 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 and implementing such health care delivery refor ms; howev er, more specific attention to the risks and needs for families in their childbe aring years is warranted. Various patient -centered medical home (PCMH) initiatives sponsored through the CMMI are testing alternativ es to the traditional primary care delivery system, with a team approach to primary care that may allow physicians and other health providers to serve more patients more effectively. CMS could encourage states and other entities to develop projects that focus on the role of the medical/health home in improving the health of wo men and infants. Current demonstration projects are linked to quality measures such as NCQA certification, and more focused efforts have the potential to drive development of better perinatal safety and quality progra ms in primary care settings. 2.C. Supp ort quality improvement activities through other agencies of HHS, including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) a nd CDC. SACIM recommends continued emphasis a nd support to AHRQ for improving the quality of perinat al services . The mission of the Agency for Healt hcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectivene ss of health care for all Americans. Infor mation from AHRQ 's research helps people make more informed decisions and improve the quality of health care services. AHRQ's work focuses on five areas: 1) quality improve ment and patie nt safety; 2) co mparing the effectiven ess of treatments; 3) prevention and care manage ment; 4) health care value; and 5) health information technology. The agency produces infor mation intended to: reduce the risk of h arm from health care servi ces, transform the practice of health care to achieve wider access to effective services and reduce unnecessary costs, and improve health care outcomes. AHRQ has developed quality indicators and other tools for use in progra ms, clinical settings, and research, condu cts evidence reviews, and produces reports to docu ment trends in health care quality. Women and children are priority populations for their work. In ter ms of perinatal care and quality, AHRQ has supported a wide array of projects on a variety of topics (e.g., postpartum depression, pregnancy warnings, bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, breastfeeding, elective induction of labor, prete rm birth prevention, gestational diabetes, folic acid, maternal weight gain, regionalization of perinatal services, and community - based participatory research to address dis parities). The agency produces materials for consu mers and professionals (e.g., clinicians, payers, researchers, health administrators, and policy makers). SACIM recommends continued support to CDC for reproductive health, preco nception, birth defects preventi on, adolescent pregnancy prevention, and other activities related to reducing i nfant mortality and im proving birth outcomes . CDC's wo rk on a strategic plan on women's health and an action plan on preconception health and health care has identified opportunities to improve the quality and effectiveness of services for wo men and infants. In 37 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 addition, further study is needed to identify effective communication, public health, and clinical strategies that can increase reproductive health awareness and life planning, prevent birth defects, prevent pregnancy among adolescents, support healthy weight gain during pregnancy, eliminate alcohol use d uring pregnancy, protect from environ mental and occupational hazards, enhance social support, and otherwise reduce risks related to reproductive health, pregnancy, and infancy. New knowledge in these and related areas should be widely disse minated to improve the quality of clinic al and community -based services. SACIM recommends continued federal investments to support national and state -level quality improvement collaborat ives and tools for learning (e.g., California Perinatal Quality Collabor ative toolkits, toolkit on implementing the Joint Com mission Perinatal Care Core Measure on Exclusive Breast Milk Feeding, Child Health Improve ment Projects) . Data -driven quality improve ment can improve maternal and neonat al outcomes throu gh multi-stakeholder quality collaboratives, statewide perinatal outco me databases, projects efforts to achieve data quality, and the use of data to drive and incentiv ize quality care. New ideas are being tested in all of the States, but implementation of best practices is slowing and progress is uneven. Federal support should be made availa ble for state and multi-state perinatal quality collaboratives. Such efforts will take quality improve ment beyond the random chance of which provider a family uses to more uniform quality care. Funding might be provided through HRSA, CDC, AHRQ, CMS, or other federal agencies and progra ms. 2.D. Supp ort health coverage for all ne wborns by requiring newborn coverage for all infants (i.e., with public or private coverage) and making temporary coverage available to those who are uninsured at birth. Health coverage is strongly associated with newborn health and survival. In line with the goals of ACA, the HHS should make automatic newborn coverage a feature of the health system beginning in January 2014. Under current federal law, states are required to automatically enroll newborns in Medicaid if their birth has been financed by Medicaid. The automatic newborn coverage rule has been a feature of Medicaid since 1986. States use a variety of mechanis ms to ensure that infants who are entitle to Medic aid from the moment of birth are not exposed to the possibility that they will be treated as ineligible for Medicaid because they lack evidence of covera ge. With implementation of the ACA, the nation should make a commitment to continuing this policy of assuring that all newborns have evidence of coverage from the moment of birth. For infants covered through private plans, this typically involves adding the baby to the coverage unit at the time of birth upon verification. For babies born into families enrolled in Medicaid, current state practices should continue. In addition, states would be requi red to automatically enroll and provide coverage through Medicaid to any infant who is otherwise uninsured at the time of birth 38 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 (i.e., not yet eligible because the mother lacks any form of pub lic or private health insurance). As with current automatic newborn eligibility, such Medicaid coverage, a temporary period of automatic enroll ment rule would be followed by the issuance of more permanent evidence of coverage, as needed. 2.E. Maximi ze the ACA investments in community health centers and workforce capacity. For wo men, infants, and families to receive high quality patient centered services throughout the continuum of perinatal care requires both a place for this care and the healthcare workforce to deliver the care. The ACA has several provisi ons to expand community health centers (CHCs, also known as Federally Qualified Health Centers - FQHCs) and to expand the primary care workforce for these centers. From the perspecti ve of infant mortality reduction, such expansion is essential because CHCs and their primary care providers offer both comprehensi ve primary care and perinatal and reproductive health care to low-income women and families in underser ved communities with significant health disparities in maternal and infant care. A dedicated fund for health center expansion has thus far suppo rted nearly 200 construction and renovation projects at existing CHCs as well as creation of dozens of new CHCs nationally.83 The ACA will fund hu ndreds more such projects by 2014. These renovations and expansions will enable CHCs to locate their essential primary care services in the communities most at need for this care and with high need for quality prenatal care and infant care.84 In addition to supporting CHC expansion in both facilities and electronic health technology, the ACA also includes provisions to increase the supply of providers available to staff these health centers. With thousands of currently unfilled provider positions in CHCs, and a target of one provider for every 2,000 patie nts, HRSA esti mates that an additional 17,722 primary care practitioners are already needed in shortage areas across the country with another 35,000 to 44,000 adult primary care providers potentially needed by 2025. The ACA's invest ment in expanding the primary care workforce focuses on increasing the supply of practitioners through educational loan forgiveness or scholarships, training expansion, higher payment rates, and crede ntialing. New funding for the National Health Service Corps provides loan repay ment and scholarships for health professional students who work in CHCs. Several progra ms aim to increase the pipeline of dedic ated primary care training, including: CHC grants to train resident physicians in the community, progra ms to encourage students to enter primary care (as physicians, advanced practice nurses (APNs), and physician assistants), and incentives for loan reduction for medical students to choose primary care in rural and underserved areas. Specific ACA provisions promote the training and use of APNs in primary care. ACA also created incentive payments to eligible primary care physicians in states' Medicaid progra ms. 39 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 SACIM recommends that HH S: Maintain the ACA multi -billion dollar c ommitment to expansion of community health centers. (CHCs, also known as federally qualified health centers -FQHCs -under the Medicare and Medicaid programs). CHC/FQHCs are experts in delivering care in a patient -centered medical home, with teams of providers and address both the medical and social deter minants of health. The comprehensive primary care delivered by CHC/FQHCs can help to reduce racial/ethnic and income disparities in infant mortality. Maximi ze opportunities in the ACA to imp rove the primary care and public health workforce . These include invest ments in training for pri mary care physicians, nurses, the public health workf orce, and community health worker s. Such inve stments will gener ate the work force needed to care for wo men, infants, and families. Include OB -GYNs in the list of providers eligible f or Medicaid pri mary care incenti ves payments . As many as half of wo men of childbearing age consider their OB- GYN to be their primary provider or medical home. Millions receive their well-woman visits from OB-GYNS. These physicians also provide a majority of prenatal care visits to women covered by Medicaid. Permitting OB-GYNs to receive primary care incentive payments through Medicaid will help to maintain access to this pool of providers. Strategic Direction 3. Redeploy key evidence -based, highly effective preventive inter ventions to a new generation of families. A variety of prevention strategies have the potential for po sitive impact on birth outco mes and infant survival. Some \u2014 such as prenatal, preconception, and well-baby care \u2014 are clinical care processes that provide opportunities to offer evidence -based interventions and health promotion. Others \u2014 such as prevention of injury and environ mental exposures \u2014 depend upon an array of health promotion, social marketing, and modifi cations to the home or community environ ment. SACIM has identified five discrete preventive interventions which are proven effective and need to be redeployed to reduce infant mortality, particula rly to have impact on postneon atal mortality and morbidity. SACIM also believes that additional messages are needed to help families identi fy warning signs of serious co nditions and that ensuring coverage for newborns will help to reduce preventable infant deaths. 40 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 3.A. Design and implement new health pro motion and social marketi ng campaig ns to accelerate use of five key preventi ve inter ventions. Evidence suggests t hat some of the most effective, proven infant mortality preventi on strategies are not being effectively communicated to and used by f amilies giving birth to the next generation .85 Immunizati on levels are low in some communiti es, and an increasing number of families are misinfo rmed about their safety and benefit .86 Breastfeeding levels are below our national objectives, and lowest among younger mothers .87 88 89 While infant mortality was reduced with a highly effective \"Back to Sleep\" campaign, many new parents do not have the message or engage in safe sleep practices and current messages do not appear to be equally effective across soci o-cultural groups.90 91 92 93 Rates of tobacco use are down; h owever, the benefits of smoking cessation are particularly great during the prenatal period and when a young child is in the home.94 95 Family planning has been shown to have direct impact on infant mortality by increasing the number of pregnan cies timed for opti mal outco me and reducing the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions .96 97 At the same time, many women have limited access or use less effective methods.98 SACIM recommends that HHS give partic ular emphasis social marketing, health education, and access to clinical and community preventive services for the foll owing five interventi ons which have proven effectiveness and are not being used to achieve maximum levels of prevention. Immunization Breastfeeding (see Appendix F) Safe sleep to prevent SIDS/SUID Smoking cessation during pregnancy and for new parents Family planning For more than fifty years, researchers have broadened our understanding of how to help individuals understand health influences and risk factors, beco me motivated to strive for opti mal health, and make lifestyle changes to optimize their health .99 100 Health promotion can be an effective strategy to modify individual behaviors that affect health. Social marketing and risk communication campaigns can influence opinions of larger numbers of individuals. Health promotion and social marketing to reduce infant mortality enco mpasses a wide array of topics, including, but not limited to: reproductive life and pregnancy planning, preconception health, folic acid, substance use, environ mental exposur es, healthy weight, preterm birth, safety and unintentional injur ies, and nutrition .101 While health promotion and social marketing strate gies can be effective, they do not always work and must be tailored to audiences. 41 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 In addition, the world has changed in terms of communication and social networking. Using new technologies, platfor ms, and modalities will be essential to the success of updated health promotion and social marketing campaigns desig ned to prevent more infant deaths. Text4baby, based on a public -private partner ship, is one example. T ext4baby has high levels of acceptance and satisfaction and growing evidence of increases in health knowledge. It also has 46 percent of enrollees signing up in the first trimester of pregnancy and a demonstrated capacity to engage women in high-poverty communities.102 More ca mpaigns using modern technology are needed to reach additional families with health promotion and prevention messages. SACIM recommends that, for the five pre ventive interve ntions listed above, HHS develop new research -based, 21st century social marketing campaigns, health promotion materials for use by individuals, and suppo rt for dissemination of such communications . We anticipate that these new social marketing and health education effor ts will be accompanied by increased need for access to services. Increa sed demand for these preventive interventions is supported by the ACA through increased coverage without cost sharing for clinical preventive services, invest ments under the Public Health and Prevention Fund for community preventive services, and increased access to primary care and medical/health homes. These elements of a nation al strategy are addressed elsewhere in this report. 3.B. Conduct health promotion a nd social mar keting campaigns to inform families about the warning signs of pregnancy complicatio ns and infant risks and the actions families should take when problems arise. Whether due to lack of info rmation, health literacy, or other barriers, many families in their childbearing years do not understand key warning signs of pregnancy complications (e.g., certain infections, preterm labor) or ser ious signs and risks for infants (e.g., fever, severe respiratory infections, crying). More should be done to ensure that pregnant women and families with infants gain high levels of knowledge and awareness of common warning signs of pregnancy complications and infant risks. Strategic Direction 4. Increase health equity and reduce disparities by targeting social determinants of health through both multi -sector investments in high -risk, under -resour ced communities and major initiatives to address poverty. Persistent racial/ethnic and econo mic disparities in adverse birth outco mes, infant mortality, and maternal mortality in the United States are a national traged y. A dispro portio nate number of African American, Puerto Rican, and American Indian/Al askan Native infants are born too early, 42 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 too small and die in the first year of life. Infants in poor f amilies, of any race/ethnicit y, face elevated risks of infant mort ality and morbidity. At the same time, the Black -White gap in adverse outco mes actually widens at higher levels of socioecono mic status. Greater econo mic resources may not be as protective of African American women's re productive health because Blacks earn less than Whites for a given level of education, support more people with those earnings, have less accumulated wealth, pay more for basic necessities, and are more likely to have suffered econo mic disadvantage as children during key develop mental periods .103 While immigrant black women's birth outco mes parallel those of non-Hispanic whites, their reproductive advantage erodes with subsequent generations of U.S.-born daughters, a pattern attributed to race-based, social disadvantage .104 The underlying causes of health disparities must be specifically tackled with deter mination. Poverty and other social deter minants of health are assoc iated with adverse birth outco mes and infant mortality, such as social -econo mic disadvantage ,105 unequal treatment,106 107 institutionalized racism (e.g., residential segregation, policies that create and perpetuate unequal opportunities), 108 109 110 minority status stressors, 111 112 113 114 and income inequities .115 116 The role of social determinants in shaping the health of mothers, infants, and families is clear and new policies may improve or worsen their impact.117 While improved access to and quality of health care services are important, they are insufficie nt for cl osing the gap.118 119 For exa mple, pregnant African American women have greater accrued risk for and fewer amassed protections again st poor birth outcomes because of the multigenerational social inequities racism produces .120 121 From a life course perspective, their reproductive health may be compromised well before they ever beco me pregnant .122 123 124 125 Reducing disparities and the underlying social and econo mic factors that drive them must be a top priority in our national strategy for improving birth outco mes and reducing infant mortality. The HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities defines major dimensions of the burden of racial and ethnic health disparities: 1) disparities in health care and unequal treatment (i.e., insura nce status, access to care, and quality of care received); 2) disparities in the nation's health and human services infrastruct ure and workforce (i.e., racial/ethnic composition of workfor ce and other cultural competency and diver sity issues); 3) disparities in the health and well-being of women, infants and families (e.g., the health status of indi viduals and communities); and 4) disparities in scientific knowledge and innovation (e.g., poorly standardized data). The HHS D isparities Action Plan also defines new opportunities to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities. (Appendix D shows a \"crosswalk\" between SACIM priorities and the HHS Disparities Action Plan showing parallel strategies and activities .) As in the HHS Disparities Action Plan, SACIM is issuing a strong call for HHS to prioritize action to increase health equity by eli minating racial/et hnic and economic health disparities that lead to infant mortality. The 43 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 potential for HHS to take collective action is great. Interagency collaboration across HHS, through HRSA, CMS, CDC, SA MHSA, and NIH is critical to achieving our goals. Likewise, SACIM has outli ned the role of partnerships between HHS and other Federal Departments. (See Strategic Direction 6.) Ensuring health equity will require multiple strategies. Key opportunities for eli minating disparities in infant mortality and other adver se pregnancy outco mes exist in the ACA, through steps to broaden access to coverage, investing in prevention, and specific provisio ns related to data collection and quality improve ment. Many s uch ACA provisions are reflected elsewhere in this report. In addition, SACIM has identified multi-sector community -based initiatives aimed at increasing health equity and influencing social deter minants as an important means to tackle disparities. Transfor mation of Healthy Start and creation of a new interagency place -based initiative are key recommendations. Reducing poverty among families in their childbearing years is equally critical to reducing infant mortality. Poverty and many of its sequelae \u2014 including poorer health status and decrea sed access to health care, diminished access to adequate housin g, lack of sufficie nt nutrition, and increased exposure to environ mental insults \u2014 are important direct correlates of infant mortality as well as risk factors for many of the key causes of infant death including preterm delivery, low birthweight, less breastfeeding, infant homicide, and SIDS/SUID. Poverty during pregnancy is associated with higher prevalence of hardship (e.g., divorce, domestic violence, homelessness, food insecurity, and no social support). 126 As such, addressing growing rates of child poverty in the United States is an essential infant mortality reduction strategy. Our recommendatio ns aim to increa se health equity both by targeting social deter minants of health through multi-sector investments in high-risk communities in order to increase access, opportunity and supports, and by accelerating efforts to reduce racism and poverty. Recomme ndation s: 4.A. Conv ene an interagency expert panel to set goals for closing infa nt mortality gaps. For both African American and American India n/Alaska Native infants, the infant mortality rate continues to be 2-3 times greater than for non -Hispanic white s. SACIM recommends that the Secretary convene an interagency panel to set goals for closing these gaps. his panel should identify targets for 2015 and 2020 based upon: historical trends, the potenti al impact of the ACA and other policies, and the potential impact of SACIM rec ommendations. A work group of SACIM or another HHS advisory body might serve as the panel. 44 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 4.B. Suppo rt and transform the federal Healthy Start program and maximi ze its potential to reduce i nfant mo rtality, eliminate disparities, and increase health equity. The federal Healthy Start program is designed to reduce the rate of infant mortality and improve perinatal outcomes through grants local areas with high rates of infant mortality. Authorized by the Congress in 1991, the program has grown from 15 grantees to a network of 105 sites across 38 states, the District of Col umbia, and Puerto Rico. Healthy Start serves approxi mately 36,000 women (as well as their babies and fathers) annually ,127 and over 90% of all Healthy Start families are African Ameri can, Hispanic, or Native American. Proje cts operate in urban, rural, tribal and border communities. Healthy Start grantees specifically aim to address ra cial/ethnic disparities in the health of mothers and babies under-resour ced communities that face many challenges, including high pover ty, inadequate access to care, and environ mental risks. All Healthy Start grante es provide the follow ing core services: direct outreach and client recruit ment, health education, case manage ment, depression screening and referral, and interconce ption care services for participating families .128 Healthy Start grantees provide patie nt-driven, community -based, culturally competent services to promote positi ve birth outco mes for so me of the nation's highest risk, vulnerable women, infants, and families. Healthy Start grantees offer a continuum of health care services and social supports, including coordination and navigation of clinical and non-clinical services for pregnant women, as well as new mothers, and their children (0-2 years old). Trained community health workers are integral to Healthy Start providing services often work ing in community-based teams with nurses, social workers, and other professional staff. 129 In addition, each Healt hy Start grantee has a consortium composed of program participants, neighborhood residents, health care providers, social service agencies, faith representatives and the business leaders. With these characteri stics, it is a forerunner of currently discussed \"place - based initiatives\" .130 131 With emphasis on community engag ement and individual empower ment, the Healthy Start approach increases civic engage ment, maximizes social capital, and fosters resilie ncy in communiti es by buil ding on stren gths and assets.132 Healthy Start is designed to improve birth outcomes by promoting positive health behaviors, responding to basic needs, reducing barriers to care, and empowering women to care for themselves and their families.133 Evaluations indicate success in reducing unmet need for services .134 Some individual grantee evaluations show promising results; however, program data and evaluations to date have been insufficient to docu ment the full impact of the national set of grantees on birth outco mes.135 136 137 138 139 140 SACIM specifically recommends that HH S: Continue funding the federal Healthy Sta rt program as a priority initiative to reduce the rate of inf ant mort ality and improve perinatal outcomes through grants to 45 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 project areas with the highest annual rates of infant mortality. Resources should be made available to expand, on a competitive basis, the use of evidence -based practices and demonstrate the effectiveness of pro mising practices through Healthy Start grantee sites. Through the eff orts of MCHB, implement new perform ance standards, evidenc e- based interventions, a nd system b uilding strategies in every Healthy Start community . New data and evaluation activities should be carried out to further docu ment the impact of Healthy Start's community -driven, patient -centered, strengths - based, and culturally competent model. A revised and improved data collection and perfor mance monitoring is needed. With new research findings Healthy Start should be re-reviewed as an evidence-based model for the MIECHV progra m. Consider using Healthy Start grantees as the hub or central coordinators for new place -based initiatives designed to reduce infant mortality and improve the health of families in their childbearing years. Give approval to Healthy Start grantees who qualify to become patient -centere d, communit y-based health teams for women, children, and families, which can seamlessly integr ate with public health and clinical services. This is parallel to the design of health teams set forth in the Affordable Care Act. In addition, Healthy Start grantees should be engaged in related, community -level imple mentation of ACA in communities with highest levels of infant mortali ty and risk (e.g., promotion, navigation, case manag ement, community health workers). 4.C. Use federal interagency colla boration to turn the curve on social determinants of health at t he community level by concentrati ng investments from multiple programs in place -based initiatives. Increasingly, local leaders committed to improving health outcomes are focused on \"place\" and how to bring policy, practices and other resources together within neighborhoods and communiti es to improve the health and well-being of residents. This interest has led to a range of efforts known as \"place -based initiatives,\" which are designed to improve outco mes and reduce disparities in high-risk communities by reducing the negative impact of social Determinants. Their aim is to create a community environ ment that promotes and protects health, while also addressing individual needs and choices .141 Placed -based initiatives can transform communiti es into more vibra nt, integrated, and healthy communities. Place -based initiatives are premised on three key approaches. T he first is to foster community syste ms change and re-align ment among existing progra ms and organizations, concentrating the value of existing resources. The second is to improve health through both access to medical care services and by broadly emphasizing health promotion and disease prevention. The third is to 46 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Comm ittee on Infant Mortality: Recommen dations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 have primary services be linked effectively to specialty or more intensi ve services for those who need them. This is not just theoretical. There are promising, even inspirational examples of community (zonal) transfo rmation, helping unite all sectors of a community to build a pathway to success. The \"Harlem Children's Zone\" is a notable example. Many other success ful child develop ment and health placed-based initiatives exist, including \"Opport unity Knocks\" or \"Help Me Grow\" in Connecticut, Boston's Oakland, \"Building Blocks Collaborati ve\". In \"Be st Babies Zones\" three communities funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation are adva ncing place d-based initiatives specifically focused on improving birth outco mes and reducing infant mortality .142 SACIM recommends that HHS lead in creation of a new federal interagency project to create place-base initi atives to optimi ze birth outcomes, reduce disparities, and increase health equity. We also recommend the follo wing steps to help ensure success. Select a group of 10 -25 local geographic areas (i.e., a neighborhood, community, city, or county) with eleva ted poor birth outcomes and high infant mortality rate s. The overall goal would be to \"turn the curve\" on the social deter minants that underlie high infant mortality rates and adverse reproductive health outco mes in a community. These infant survival zones might overlap conceptually and geographic ally with federal projects funded through Healthy Start and maximize the potential for projects such as \"Promise Neighborhoods\" and \"Empower ment Zones\". Concentrate federal investment, bringing together all federally supported programs in a comm unity. These initiatives must be supported by a federal interagency collab oration giving priority for investment to selected communities. The aim is to create synergy and maximize the impact of investments in higher -risk families and underser ved communities. Ideally, each community would receive federal funding to host each of the nation's community -based maternal and child progra ms, inclu ding Healthy Start, Head Start, MIECHV, Proje ct Launch, WIC, community health center, and similar progra ms. In addition, priority for invest ments such as child care, education, mental health, housing, transportation, job training, and other services might be created in these communities. Require partnerships with the private sector (e.g., private providers, businesses, churches, universities, and local philanthropies). The partnerships would play an essential role in this common effort to transform the community. Designate a neutral co nvener organ ization (e.g., a community agency, local health department, Healthy Start grantee) c ommitted to a placed -based approach . Such an entity would facilit ate collab oration of all relevant community sectors. 47 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Comm ittee on Infant Mortality: Recommen dations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Require a local area strategic plan and common goals/metric s. The specific program matic details may vary by community, but all partnership organizations would work toward defined community trans formation goals, with common metrics and evaluation of progress. 4.D. Addre ss and alleviate poverty, which has a kno wn impact on infant mortality, through enhanced use of income supports thr ough TANF, EITC, and other policies. Poverty and many of its sequelae \u2014 inclu ding poorer health status and decrea sed access to health care, diminished access to adequate housing, lack of sufficient nutrition, and increased exposure to environ mental insults \u2014 are importa nt direct correlates of infant mortality as well as risk factors for many of the key causes of infant death including preterm delivery, low birthweight, infant homicide, and SUID. As such, addressing growing rates of child poverty in the United States is an essential infant mortality reduction strategy. Families of childb earing age are more likely than older families and individuals to have low income. Currently, although children make up 24 percent of the US population, they represent 34 percent of all individuals in poverty. Young children, those under age 6, are particularly vulnera ble because they typically have young parents who have lower levels of education and a less a more tenuous relationship to the job market and to well-paying and regular employment than older parents. In 2010, al most half of children under 6 \u2014 more than 11 million young children \u2014 lived in low-income families (i.e., those with incomes less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level). Of these, nearly 6 million children were poor (livi ng in families with incomes less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level) .143 The national recession further exacer bated the situation for young children as the typically lower educational level of their parents coupled with declining employment rate and stagnant wages increased their likelihood of living in impoverished families. Overall, the child poverty rate rose d uring the first three years of the curre nt econo mic recession (2008-2010) a nd remained consta nt in 2011 at 22 percent.144 Unfortunately, the nation no longer has a strong, coordinated anti-pover ty strategy. One program that is designed to address poverty, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is no longer serving as an adequate safety net to address poverty. In fact, while the national TANF caseload declined between 1995 and 2010, the number of families with children in poverty increased by 17% during this time period, from 6.2 million to 7.3 million. In 1995 TANF's predec essor, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) lifted 62% of very poor children out of poverty; however, in 2005, TANF lifted only 21% of very poor children out of poverty .145 So while the TANF Block Grant has been effective in its objecti ve to remove families from the welfare \"rolls\", it has not been effective in moving families out of poverty. TANF's stren gths and weaknesses as an anti-poverty program have been debated since its inception and although it is not the place of this report to provide specific recom mendations on the many nuances of 48 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Comm ittee on Infant Mortality: Recommen dations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 TANF including the contingency fund, changes in what can be counted as work, and use of perfor mance measures such as the work participation rate, we believe all of these aspects of the TANF Block Grant deserve attention from the Secretary of DHHS. For TANF, SACIM recommends that the Secretary of DHH S: Document and report on the TANF's effecti veness as a safety net f or poor children in each state. Require states to spend a specific portion of their TANF funds directly supporting families in need with either ca sh assistance or subsidi zed employme nt. Study the impact of c urrent policies on the population of women with young children who have reached their time lim its and now fall into the category of \" no welfare, no work\" . In addition, to move the nation toward greater support for p oor families in their childbearing years, SACIM recommends that t he Secret ary work with the US Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service t o: Expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EI TC) to families who do not work (and have demonstrated t hey are unable to work or cannot fi nd work) Work with states without an EITC or a refundable EITC to implement a state -level refundable EITC by 2 016 Allow poor famili es with no tax li ability to r eceive the Child Tax Credit Invest in state demonstration projects f or Children's Savings Accounts Advance policies in su pport of paid family me dical leave, partic ularly paid maternity leave for n ew mothers146 Convene a commission explore t he develop ment of a national Children's Allo wance program . 4.E. Add of HHS Initi atives a iming to eliminate disparities and increase health equity. While many agencies and entities are listed in the HHS Disparities Action Plan, SACIM is not. We believe our charter and our history place SACIM among those entities aiming to eliminate disparities and increase health equity. 49 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Comm ittee on Infant Mortality: Recommen dations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Strategic Direction 5. Invest in adequate data, surveillance systems, and research to measure health care access, quality, and birth outcomes. Timely and accurate data are needed to help inform the most important policies and progra ms for families across the country. Collecting, analyzi ng, and applying the knowledge from a wide range of data will help to define the extent, causes, and contributors to infant mortality and poor birth outco mes.147 Some information comes from surveys, some from clinical practice, and still more from special, focused studies. Without such data, we cannot understand the proble m, monitor trends in service utilization, and use data for quality improve ment. No one data system can supply what is needed even to address infa nt mortalit y; the nation needs multiple data syste ms working in a coordinated and linked fashion where possible. Having accurate data depends on public health professio nals, clinical care providers, health plans, and state and federal agencies, as well as indi viduals who give their permission for personal infor mation to be used for scientific purposes. SACIM is concerned that several important data, monitoring, and surveillance systems that are needed to inform the nation's infant mortality strategy are in disrepair or seriously underfunded. HHS leadership is critical to repairing, supporting, and funding these syste ms. In addition, throughout the 20 years, SACIM panels have called for additional research and we renew that call. There is no que stion that further research is needed to understand the causes of and opportunities for prevention of infant mortality, maternal mortality, birth defects, preterm birth, SIDS/SUID, and other adverse pregnancy outco mes. Recomme ndation s: 5.A. Make investments in the National Vital Statistics system to assure timely, a nd accurate birth and maternal and i nfant death statistics. The Nation al Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) works collab oratively with states and territories, through the National Vital Statistics Program to help ensure the publication of data that best re flect the experie nces of families that experience pregnan cies, live births and fetal and infant deaths in the United States. Lack of universal adoption of the 2003 Standard Birth Certificate has created a fragmented system of birth data, severely limiting its usefulness in identifying national priorities for perinatal health. In 2003, NCHS issued a revised U.S. Standard Live Birth Certificate which updated the previous one issued in 1989. Whereas the 1989 Standard Certificate of Live Birth was adopted by all jurisdictions within two years, the 2003 Standard was adop ted by only 13 jurisdictions within two years .148 By 2012, more than 8 years later, 13 sta tes are still using the 1989 standard. 50 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Comm ittee on Infant Mortality: Recommen dations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 One pri mary reason for the lack of universal adoption of the 2003 Standard has been that federal funding to states to support i mplementation and training for the Vital Statistics system has remained constant over the past decade. SACIM recom mends that HHS com mit the necessary resources to support adoption of the 2003 Standard Birth Certificate by all jurisdictions. SACIM emphasizes the foundational and central role of the birth certificate in assessing and improving maternal and infant health outco mes. Birth certificate data should be made consistent across states, rapidly availa ble to drive health services and quality, and linked to other data sources. 5.B. Incentivi ze reporting of Medicaid perinatal data from every state, based on a uniform set of quality and outcome measures. While nearly half of all births are financed by Medicaid, no national Medicaid perinatal data set exists. For infants, reporting on the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treat ment (EPSDT) program provides utilization data regarding wellchild visits. No si milar national data set exists to measure utilizat ion of prenatal care, birth services, newborn care, and postpartum visits. No uniform approach to defining or counting Medicaid births exists today. Reporting on some measures is done by managed care organiz ations participating in Medicaid; however, this is much less than the full population and not uniform in scope across states and plans. Moreover, no uniform reporting on outco me measures is underway. Nationwide reporting of Medicaid perin atal data would all ow for the identification of gaps in the program as well as areas where the program is performing well in meeting the needs of families. In 2012, the CMS Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) convened an Expert Panel on Improving Maternal and Child Health Outco mes. This is an important step in the right direction. SACIM members, along with other invited experts, are engaged in discussions about what to measure, what is feasible for states to measure, and best practices in measure ment. They are focused on an array of topics such as measur ement strate gies for prenatal care, preterm births, postpart um visits, and preconce ption care/well -woman visits. The CMS Expert Panel also intends to make recom mendations for quality and perfor mance measures. SACIM specifically recommends that CMS define a perinatal data set in partnership with states and that incentives be g iven to States to collect and report a ne wly defined, uniform set of pe rinatal quality and outcome measure s. 5.C. Provide resources to expand the Pregnan cy Risk As sessment a nd Monitoring System (PRAMS) to every st ate in order to monitor the health of women and infants. PRAMS is a surveilla nce project of the CDC a nd state health depart ments. PRAMS includes state-specific, population -based data on maternal attitudes and experiences before, during, and 51 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Comm ittee on Infant Mortality: Recommen dations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 shortly after pregnancy. PRAMS data are not available from other sources and can be used to identify groups of women and infants at high risk for health proble ms, to monitor changes in health status, and to measure progress towar ds goals in improving the health of mothers and infants. Current PRAMS states have used the data to inform legisl ative and program matic efforts, including support for breastfeeding polici es and initiatives (http://www.cdc.g ov/pra ms/). As of this writing, 40 states and New York City currently participate in PRAMS (78% of live births) . SACIM recom mends that funding be made available to the remaining states and the District of Colu mbia to conduct PRAMS. 5.D. Systematic use of quality measures for women and children. With develop ment and approval of measures by the AHRQ and the National Quality Foru m, as well as other entities, the opportunity for more routine use of quality measure ment throughout the health care system is not only feasible but an imperative. The Nation al Quality Forum perinatal care quality measures are a starting point but more can and should be done .149 150 The ACA called for increased emphasis on quality measure ment for both children and adults, and many projects are underway to fulfill new mandates or ado pt new measures. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) also called for new child health measures. Public -private collaboration is underway through partnerships with professional associations (e.g., American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \"reVITALize\" project, Medicaid Medical Directors Learning Network), as well as state level perinatal quality collab oratives.151 SACIM specifically recommends that HHS: Widely dis seminate AHRQ/NQF measures to help promote their adoption in practice. Continue to engage in and support a ctions by CMS, HRSA, AHRQ, and other agencies t hat will imp rove the co nsistency, accuracy, and utili zation of quality measures. In addition to the e Measure initiative for e xtracting quality measures from electronic medic al record, devel op a similar eBirthCertificate process to ensure that Vital Records clinical data are at the highest level of qualit y. Such a process would give attention to formal electronic specification that permit more effective and efficie nt use of birth certificate data in the context of electronic medical records. This should be included as part of \"meaningful use\" projects. 52 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Comm ittee on Infant Mortality: Recommen dations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 5. E. Continue support for other related data systems, including: Title V Information System (T VIS); MIECHV data; National zation (BRFSS); -Infant Mortality Re view (FIMR); ne wborn screening data; and the National Birth Defects Preve ntion Net work and state -based birth defects surveillance. Each of the se data systems collect unique and important data for use in program and policy decisions. SACIM recommends that funding for these progra ms should increase commensurate with agency recom mendations. In addition, we encourage invest ment in linked data activities, particularly linkages between vital records and related maternal and child health data. 5.F. Give priority to re search into the causes and prevention of i nfant mortality through NIH, AHRQ, HRSA, CDC, CM S, SAMHSA, and other parts of HHS. Continued invest ment in research has been recommended by SACIM for the past 20 years. Some progress has been made, but additio nal effort is needed. Research invest ments must move beyond a focus etiology to include invest ments focused on best practices, as well as innovation and translation. The nation needs to support b asic research, translati onal research, health servi ces research, research related to quality, and particip atory action research to illuminate causes, barriers, and solutions for the problem of infant mortality. Research should be supported through various units of HHS and efforts should be coordinated to maximize resources and impact. For exa mple, NIH, CDC, and HRSA are all conducting and/or supporting research related to preterm birth, SIDS, birth defec ts (congenital conditions and heritable disorders), child injury, child maltrea tment, and other related issues. The National Children's Study \u2014 one of the richest research efforts designed to study children's health and develop ment \u2014 is led by the NIH in collaboration with a consortium of federal partners including CDC, HRSA, and the Environ mental Protection Agency (EPA). Strategic Direction 6. Maximi ze the potential of interagency, public -private, and multi -disciplinary collaboration The SACIM recom mendations in this report reflect our knowledge and certainty that reducing infant mortality in the United States will require a multi-faceted effort, including integration of clinical care and public health into comprehensive syste ms of care, practice improvement by service providers, changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of men and women of childb earing age, improved access to health care, empowered communiti es, health equity, and a 53 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Comm ittee on Infant Mortality: Recommen dations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 serious com mitment to prevent ion. We cannot achieve our infant mortality reduction goals by working in silos. While our pri mary charge is to make recom mendations to the Secretary and HHS, we strongly belie ve that it is time for all sectors beyond public health and medicine to embrace infant mortality as \"their\" issue and strategically maximize their investments. For exa mple both the National Action Plan to Reduce Disparities and National Prevention Strategy contain infant mortality reduction activities. SACIM believes that actio ns are needed at the national, state, community, family, and individual levels, and through public -private partn erships to leverage innovation, technology, expertise, and community assets to achieve the goal of eli minating preventable infant deaths. SACIM recommends that HHS t ake the foll owing actions to harness the public and private leadership, experti se and resources needed to reduce inf ant mort ality, prevent more adverse birth outcomes such as pret erm birth, and help families achieve success in childbea ring at the right time, right place, and with the supports they need. 6.A. Engage the National Prevention Council and build upon the National Prevention Strategy. The National Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health Council (National Prevention Council), under the leadership of Surgeon Gener al Regina Benja min, MD, has a potential role to advance a cabinet -level, interagency focus on r educing infant mortali ty and closing the gap between African -American and white babies. Within HHS, many agencies and offices can make further contributions to infant mortality reduction efforts. These include but are not limited to: AHRQ, CDC, CMS, HRSA, NIH, Office of Adolescent Health (OAH), Office on Minority Health (OMH), Office of Population Affairs (OPA), Office on Women's Health (OWH), Office of the Surgeon General, SAMHSA and other parts of HHS. In addition, through the National Prevention Council HHS can also engage and partner with the Depart ments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Labor, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Develop ment, Interior, Justice, Veterans Affairs, as well as the Corporation for National and Community Service, Domestic Policy Council, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Trade Com mission, Office of Management and Budget, and Office of National Drug Control Policy, and others carrying out the national strategy to reduce infant mortality. 54 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Comm ittee on Infant Mortality: Recommen dations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Figure 8. National Prevention Strategy SACIM specifically recommends that HHS prov ide incentives for states and communities to implem ent approaches in the National Prevention Strategy for improving the health of women of childbearing age, men, and infants through community preventi ve services and public health approache s. Under the priority topic \"reprod uctive and sexual health\" the National Prevention Strategy calls for speci fically for increased attention to preconception, prenatal, and other reproductive health services. For example, it calls for HHS to promote and disse minate best practices and tools to reduce behavioral risk facto rs and to research and disse minate effective methods to prevent IPV. As illustrated above in Figure 8, other services and supports called for in the National Prevention Strategy \u2014 such as tobacco control, healthy eating, limited use of drugs and alcohol, active living, and safe home and community environ ments \u2014 are also critical to improved birth outco mes. More invest ment is needed to fulfill our nation's prevention goals.55 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Comm ittee on Infant Mortality: Recommen dations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 \"The strength and ing enuity of America 's people and com munities have driven America's success. A hea lthy and fit nation is vital to that str ength and is the bedrock of the pro ductivity, innovation, and entre preneursh ip essential for o ur future.

A healthy nation is able to educate its people, create and susta in a thriving economy, defe nd itself, and rema in prepared for emergencies.\" National Pr evention Strategy, page 6. 6.B. Strengthen state health departments with effecti ve federal -state partnershi ps, particularly through activities under way at HRSA, CMS, and CDC. States are the engine of innovation and the drivers of health policy change in the United States. This has lo ng been true. The recent Healthy Babies Initiative of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) and the compendium of ideas on improving birth outco mes and reducing infant mortality152 prepared by the Association of Mater nal and Child Health Progra ms (AMCHP) are just two e xamples. Several recent initiati ves of HRSA, CMS, and CDC (many mentioned above) are mechanis ms to strengthen federal -state partner ships in reducing infant mortality. In particular, we note the importance of the HRSA Collaborative Innovat ion and Improvement Networks (COIN), the potential to use Strong Start to demonstrate care models beyond prenatal care (e.g., preconception care, regional perinatal care), and the potenti al for CDC to support better surveilla nce and data systems. 6.C. Maximi ze the potential of pu blic-priva te partnershi ps, particularly by engaging private sector organi zations which have a distinct focus on preventing infant mortality. The list of potential partners is long; however, SACIM notes the particular contributions in recent years of the March of Dimes, AMCHP, and ASTHO. In addition, SACIM acknowledges the important role of professional organizations such as the American College of Obstetricia ns and Gynecologists (ACOG), A merican Acade my of Family Physicians (AAFP), A merican College of Nurse Mid wives (ACNM), A merican Public Health Association, Association of Women's Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN), Society for Mater nal Fetal Medicine, and others. 56 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Comm ittee on Infant Mortality: Recommen dations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 6.D. Engage women (daughters, mothers, and gr andmothers) in efforts to preve nt infant mortality, improve women's health, and strengthen family health and well-being. With the creation of the White House Council on Women and Girls in October 2009, President Obama signaled his recognition that the issues f acing women are not just women's issues. The Council's purpose is to ensure that each feder al agency takes into account the needs of women and girls in federal policies and progra ms. SAC IM strongly believes that engaging and empowering women will be essential to reducing U.S. infant mortality rates and having stronger, healt hier men, women, child ren, and families. 57 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Comm ittee on Infant Mortality: Recommen dations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 APPENDIX A: Continuum of Services to Prior to Birth Improve the Health of Women and Birth Outcomes Preconception Prenatal Birth Interconception Care consistent with Reproductive Early, continuous, & quali ty prenatal care Postpartum Visit Interconcep tion care consistent with Life Plan Family planning Immunization Identification of signs of preterm labor Better health for women Effective use of 17P No elective preterm delivery Birth in quali ty, risk appropriate facility reproductive histo ry Folic acid Reduced fetal mortality No exposure Alcohol mana gement Alcohol cessa tion Improved birthweight distribution Reduced preterm birth Better infant & child health outcomes Screening & treatment for STI, HIV, and other infections Healt hy weight Reduced birth defects Reduced infant & child morbidi ty Smoking cessa tion Mate rnal chronic disease control Psycho-social supports and services Reduced infant mortality Developed by Kay Johnson, Merry-K Moos, Anne Dunlop, & Rebekah Gee.

Coverage, Benefits, and Patient Protections Inform women of their coverage options, rights, and opportunities to gain access to health coverage and care . This would include promotion of the women's clinical preventive services package. The Office of Women's Health has created one grant opportun ity. This work should be continued and expanded. Inform f amilies about the preventive serv ices coverage f or Bright Futures well-baby care, imm unizations, and ne wborn screenin g. Continued emphasis on well -baby visits, immunizations, and newborn screening can save lives as those factors that lead to death during the post-neonatal period are well-known and amenable to intervention. Promote utili zation of benefits am ong ne wly covered young adults to age 26 . Pregnancy and birth rates are highest for wo men in their twenties, particularly ages 20- 24. Pro moting the use of preventive and other health care is especially important for this age group. (We should not wait until they are pregnant.) Protect CHIP and Medicaid coverage for childre n. The ACA 's \"maintenance of effort\" provision requires that States maintain eligibility for child ren enrolled in the Medi caid program in families earning <133% of the federal poverty level or the CHIP program until 2019. These provisions, plus automatic newborn eli gibility and continuous eligibility through the first year of life under Medica id, are vital to low-income infants. Monitor pre -existing condition e xclusions f or children . Infants are protected by the ACA provision that prohibits health plans from denying insurance to children due to pre- existing conditions. Birth defects and other congenital conditions were formerly considered pre-existing conditions by so me plans. HHS should monitor compliance. Innovation and Focus through Medicaid Use the Center for Me dicare and Medicaid Innovations to demonstrate the effective - ness of new care model s. The Strong Start grant opportunity to evaluate the effect of enhanced prenatal care is an important step. Future innovations grants - maybe another stage of Strong Start - could demonstrate approaches that span the continuum from family planning through pregnancy and birth to 24 months of interconception care for 60 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 low-income, high-risk women and infants. Innovation Grant Challenge projects also should include efforts aimed at improved quality in newborn and regional perinatal care. Support States' use of Medica id health homes for women of childbearing age with chronic co nditions. For wo men of childbearing age, for example, such projects might aim to provide an effective, patient -cente red medical home for wo men with two or more chronic conditions (e.g., asthma, obesity, diabetes, substance use disorder, mental health conditions). Each of these conditions increases risk for an adverse birth outco me. Encourage and permit states to demonst rate the effecti veness of interconceptio n/ interpregnancy care in Medicaid . In 2011, Georgia implemented the first Medicaid waiver to focus on interconception care building on a success ful Atlanta project. Louisiana has CMS approval for a similar project in New Orleans. Other states are seeking State Plan Amendments and CMS approval for projects that should not require waivers. Demonstration proje cts now can help to inform action when Medicaid coverage is expanded under ACA in 2014. Home Vi siting Enhance the role of home visiting prog rams in supporting interconception health. Current home visiting models for mothers and young children have not led to consistent and significant improve ments in maternal health outco me. This stands in contrast to their results for child ren. Strong Start will link to the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program evaluation (particularly in relationship to birth outco mes); however, we call for more attention to prevention of adverse outco mes in subsequent pregnancies through interconception care for mothers served in the MIECHV progra m. Primary C are Capacity and Workf orce pment Maintain the ACA multi -billion dollar c ommitment to expansion of community health centers (CHCs, also known as federally qualified health centers -FQHCs -under the Medicare and Medicaid programs). CHC/FQHCs are experts in delivering care in a patient -centered medical home, with teams of providers and address both the medical and social deter minants of health. The comprehensive primary care delivered by CHC/FQHCs can help to reduce racial/ethnic and income disparities in infant mortality. Maximi ze opportunities in the ACA to improve the primary care and public health workforce . These include invest ments in training for pri mary care physicians, nurses, the public health workf orce, and community health worker s. Such inve stments will gener ate the work force needed to care for wo men, infants, and families. 61 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 Prevention and Public Health Promote breastfeedin g. HHS should collaborate with the Depart ment of Labor to monitor and protect breastfeeding mothers' right to reasonable break time and appropriate space in the workplace to express breast milk as enacted through the ACA. Also monitor state Medicaid financing for breastfeeding. Protect the Prevention and Public Health Fund . Twice, the Prevention and Public Health Invest ment Fund dollars have been used to fund other priorities. These funds are vitally needed to focus on the health and welln ess of our families and communities. Encourage states to use Community Trans formation Gr ants (CTGs) to address the chronic di sease ri sks and needs of women of childbearing age. Without specific direction related maternal and child health, many grantees have not partnered or focused on wo men of reproductive age and/or children. More explicit guidance is needed. Guide st ates and communities toward approaches for improving the health of women and infants th rough the National Pr evention St rategy . The Strategy calls for increased preconception, prenatal, and other reproductive health services. The tobacco control, healthy eating, limited use of drugs and alcohol, active living, and safe home and community environ ments called for in the Strate gy also are critical to healthy babies. 62 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 APPENDIX D. Crosswalk between HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities and SACIM recommendations to reduce infant mortality The HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities and its companion docu ment the National Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving Health Equity, a product of the National Partnership for Action (\"NPA Stakehol der Strategy\"), define clear approaches and actio ns. Many of the identified strategies and actions align with SACIM recom menda tions. The HHS D isparities Action Plan proposes a set of Secretarial priorities and five strategic goals from the HHS Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2010 -2015 provide the framework for the HHS Disparities Action Plan. (page 11) They are to: I. Transform health care; II. Strengthen the nation's Health and Human Services infra structure and workforce; III. Advance the health, safety, and well-being of the American people; IV. Advance scientific knowledge and innovation; and V. Increase the efficiency, transparen cy, and accountability of HHS programs. SACIM has proposed to six areas for the national strategy to reduce infant mortality that overlap with the Disparities Action Plan goals. 1. Improve the health of women pri or to pregnancy . a. As called for by the HHS Disparities Action Plan (I.A), SACIM recom mends increasing insurance and access to preventive services, particularly for low - income, minority women who are uninsured. 2. Ensure access to s afe and high -quality, patie nt-centered care a. Example 1: SACIM recom mends building upon the COIN strategy launched in 13 Southern states to capitalize on the partnership of MCHB/HRSA, CMS, ASTHO, NGA, and MOD. These states have some of the greatest racial and ethnic disparities in birth outco mes. b. Exa mple 2. As called for by the HHS Dispariti es Action Plan (I.B), SACIM recom mends expanding community health centers and Nation al Health Service core in medically underserved areas and using community -based health teams to support and enhance primary care effectiveness. 3. Redeploy key evidence -based, hi ghly effec tive preventi ve inter ventions to a new generation of parent s. a. Example 1: SACIM has recom mended giving high priority to topics such as immunization, breastfeeding, smoking cessation, and family planning where rates of utilization have stagnated. 63 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 b. Exa mple 2: As called for by the HHS Disparities Action Plan (III.A.2), SACIM recom mends education campaigns regarding preventive benefits. 4. Increase health equity and reduce disparities by targeti ng social determinants of health thr ough both multi -sector investments in high -risk, under -resourced communiti es and major initiatives to address poverty . a. Example 1: As called for by the HHS Dispariti es Action Plan (II.B), S ACIM calls for increased use of community health workers, pro motoras, and doulas to provide education, navigation, and support to individuals in their communities. b. Exa mple 2: Use interagency collaboration to turn the curve on social determinants of health at the community level by connecting and concentrating federal resources of Healthy Start, community health centers, home visiting, housing, education, child care, transportation, and other federal resources (these might be known as Best Baby Zones). c. Example 3: As called for by the HHS Disparities Action Plan (III.A.5), SACIM also recom mends continued emphasis on progra ms such as the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program that aim to address multiple risks and protective factors that affect more vulnerable families. d. Exa mple 4: As is called for in the HHS Disparities Action Plan (II.C.2), SACIM members have called upon the Secretary to use reauthorization of TANF as an opportunity to increase education and training in communities with high levels of infant mortality. 5. Invest in a dequate data, monitoring, and surveillance sy stems to me asure access, quality, and outcomes a. Example 1: As is called for in the HHS Disparities Action Plan (3.a page 13), SACIM recom mends that CMS to imple ment measures and incentives to improve health care quality for wo men and infants. b. Exa mple 2: Support standardized vital statistics and incentivize linkage among vital statistics, Medicaid, and other health data to boost transparency and accountability. 6. Maximi ze the potential of interagen cy, public -private, a nd multi -disciplinary collabor ation. HHS Dispa rities Action Plan (IV.B), SACIM members have called for research to inform disparities reduction, including new analyses of the factors that drive disparities in outco mes today, more community - based participatory research, and testing innovative strategies.64 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 APPENDIX E. Specific HHS Action to Increase Breastfeeding HHS could expand promotion of and support for early, exclusive and continued breastfeeding by: Continuing the work of the HHS Working Group for Worksite Lactation Suppor t, a partnership between the Office on Wo men's Health and HRSA Continuing the Nation al Breast feeding Helpline as part of the National Women's Health Infor mation Center (OWH) Supporting education related to breastfeeding in undergraduate and graduate medical and nursing school curriculum as part of the federal support for med ical and other health professional education Sponsoring research on how best to suppo rt breastfeeding success, especially among most vulnerable populations (NICHD) expanding funding for federal - and state-level breastfeeding initiatives that support community actions, such as breastfeeding support in child care settings, among faith- based organizations, and in K-12 education Sponsoring a report on current state initiatives (HRSA, CDC) Support the develop ment of additio nal Donor Milk Banks to achieve the Joint Com mission goal (CDC, HRSA -MCHB) Complementing WIC breastfeeding support with social marketing campaigns using PSAs and social media (OWH, USDA) Including breastfeeding educa tion and support in all related obesity and diabetes prevention projects (CDC, HRSA -MCHB) Issuing additional guidance on the ACA provisions related to breastfeeding support (DOL, OWH)65 Report of the Secret ary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality: Recommendations for HHS Action and Framew ork for a National Strategy January 2013 References 1 MacDor man MF, Mathews TJ.
