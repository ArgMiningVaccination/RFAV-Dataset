For me, I feel expanded, humbled, in awe; I feel great love, like the love one feels when taking in the ocean rising to meet the moon or suddenly walking into a mist of butterflies. This knowing/feeling often comes unannounced, but it doesn't have to be that way. It is accessible through pule (prayer) and espe - cially through no'ono'opono (meditation), to name just two possible entry points. Though I am, through time and practice, getting more adept at cultivating balance between the ego and the spiritual state and under - standing and nurturing the conditions for this knowing in myself, I am still learning. I am not an expert. In 1986, I began healing people of diseases from which their doctors had already pronounced they would be imminently dying or chronically doomed to suffer. I was able to completely reverse the diseases or chronic illnesses they had: pneumonia, bleeding ulcer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and emphysema to name a few. There was a lot of talk involved in some cases, but no talk involved in others. I prescribed no herbs or external botanical remedies. I merely lay on my hands around the body or on the body. In a few cases, I sent my energy and wasn't even in the same room, or on the same continent as the person who was ailing. 0\\\u0003H[SHULHQFH\u0003OHG\u0003PH\u0003WR\u0003TXHVWLRQ\u0003WKH\u0003:HVWHUQ\u0003FRQ - cept of health and healing and the way I was raised to WKLQN\u0003RI\u0003LW\u0011\u00037KH\u0003:HVWHUQ\u0003ELRPHGLFDO\u0003PRGHO\u000f\u0003IRU\u0003WKH\u0003PRVW\u0003 part, assumes a mind-body dichotomy and although there are physicians who have become more aware of the limitations of this point of view, a majority of :HVWHUQ\u0003GRFWRUV\u0003WUHDW\u0003WKH\u0003ERG\\\u0003LQ\u0003LVRODWLRQ\u0003IURP\u0003RWKHU\u0003 facets of a person's life.

Thus, for example, as of this writing, the phenomenon of millions of Americans who submit themselves to the prognosis and prescription of doctors without fail and without question, as if the doctors were gods. I take the sociological perspective of Freund and McGuire as my own, for in my healing encounters, I have found that in addition to the physical factors involved, emotional, psychological, and spiritual components of a person's psyche have as much and sometimes more influence over the well being and strength of their immune systems. I believe that the separation of the body and mind is a fragmented and limited model and have found evidence to this effect in the fields of biochemistry,2 neuroscience,3 and parapsychology.4 5 Furthermore, I see the body, mind, and spirit as interacting dynamics of the human condition, and as these dynamics respond to stimuli in the environment (social as well as physical), the state of health or illness is affected. I am not intending to bifurcate alternative healing and the biomedical model. I merely wish to outline from which model I am speak - ing and how I am defining a crucial part of the nature of health and healing for this project. In this discussion, I approach the body/mind/spirit as a unified phenom - enon. I see healing as straddling both the biophysical and the body/mind/spirit models. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), defines comple - mentary and alternative medicine as \"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of FRQYHQWLRQDO\u0003PHGLFLQH\u00b5\u0003DQG\u0003OLVWV\u0003GLVWLQFWLRQV\u0003VXFK\u0003DV\u0003 these: 1. Complementary m edi cin e is used together with conventional medicine... to help lessen a patient's discomfort following surgery. 2. Alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. An example of an alternative therapy is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of undergoing surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy that has been recommended by a conventional doctor. 3. Integrative medicine co mb in es tre a tm en ts from conventional medicine and CAM for which there is some high-quality evidence of safety and effectiveness.6 My interest in these definitions lies more in the subtext of the classifications, or in the histories that re - main hidden beneath the text. For example, a common denominator of the three categories is that all of them, in one way or another, have their roots in native, lay - man, and ethnic forms of healing, or forms of healing that are, and have been for often thousands of years, accessible to (lay) people. Paul Starr writes in his definitive history of the rise of America's medical profession, The Social Transformation of American Medicine , that in North America, pre-independence, and before the consolida - tion of the medical profession's authority (1850-1930), native medicine was a source of popular treatment. From the time of the first settlements, colonists were drawn to native healing because initially, natives were \"free from all the dread diseases that afflicted Europeans, and their good health was...thought to be a product of their special knowledge of indigenous PHGLFLQDO\u0003KHUEV\u0011\u00b5\u00031DWLYH\u0003FXUHV\u0003ZHUH\u000f\u0003DFFRUGLQJ\u0003WR\u0003DQ\u0003 HDUO\\\u0003KLVWRULDQ\u000f\u0003\u00b4WRR\u0003PDQ\\\u0003WR\u0003UHSHDW\u000f\u00b5\u0003DQG\u0003LQFOXGHG\u0003VXU - JHU\\\u0011\u0003&RWWRQ\u00030DWKHU\u0003ZURWH\u0003WKDW\u0003\u00b4,QGLDQ\u00b5\u0003PHGLFLQH\u0003ZDV\u0003 \u00b4WUXO\\\u0003VWXSHQGRXV\u000f\u00b5\u0003DV\u0003GLG\u0003PDQ\\\u0003RWKHU\u0003FRORQLVWV\u0003ZKR\u0003 believed some Native healers as good as \"regular ZKLWH\u0003GRFWRUV\u00b5\u0003 6WDUU\u000f\u0003\u0014 \u001b\u0015\u000f\u0003SS\u0011\u0003\u0017\u001b\u00b2\u0017 \u0011 Ethnic medicine includes such practices as Ayurveda, Chinese herbology, acupuncture and qigong, to name a few and lay, or popular medicine included such practices as homeopathy, botanics, mid - wifery, inoculation, chiropractic, bone setting, abortion, osteopathy, and surgery. Although the transfer of information went both ways between lay practitioner and those who were trying to create a medical profes - sion, the relationships between the two entities were 30 Educational Perspectives Y Volume 45 Y Numbers 1 and 2 not friendly. Lay practitioners were suspicious of the motives of doctors who lay practitioners felt were more interested in acquiring wealth and status within a restricted domain of practice than in healing. Both lay practitioners and the populace resisted attempts to take the commonsense of healing arts out of the hands of everyday people. Important remedies used by regular physicians, such as smallpox inoculation and cinchona (quinine), were borrowed from folk cultures as well. In the nineteenth century, lay competition created much of the pressure against the medical profession to DEDQGRQ\u0003\u00b4KHURLF\u00b5\u0003SUDFWLFHV\u0003VXFK\u0003DV\u0003EORRGOHWWLQJ\u000f\u0003 intestinal purging, vomiting, blistering and treating people with salves made of mercury (Starr, 1982, p. 47).

The key scientific breakthroughs in bacteriology came in the 1860s and 1870s in the work of Pasteur and Koch. The 1880s saw the extension and diffusion of these discoveries and by 1890 their impact began to be felt. The isolation of the organisms responsible for the major infectious diseases led public health officials to shift from the older, relatively inefficient measures against disease in general to more focused measures against specific diseases. These new efforts made a particularly notable difference in the control of water-borne and food-borne diseases. Sand filtration of the water supply, introduced in the 1890s, was far more effective in preventing typhoid than was earlier sanitary reform; regulation of the milk supply dramatically cut infant mortality. ...The other early successful use of bacteriology was in surgery. The advent of antiseptic surgery in the late nineteenth century sharply reduced the mortality from injuries and operations and increased the range of surgical work. (ibid., p. 135) The introduction of technological advance - ments such as the stethoscope, ophthalmoscope, laryngoscope, microscope, x-ray, spirometer, and electrocardiograph produced data seemingly independent of the physi - cian's as well as the patient's subjective judgment, while drug companies began deferring to and tai - loring their products to be in compliance with the American Medical Association's (AMA) guidelines.

(ibid.,p. 137) The confluence of developments worked together in the building of an industry and led to the present- day situation in which we currently exist: on the one hand, there is the medical system that has sovereignty and absolute authority over who and what is allowed to legitimately practice medicine, while on the other hand, we have the population, the vast majority of whom can not afford to pay for the services of doctor or hospital or for pharmaceutical costs without health insurance and 50 million Americans unable to afford health insurance (U.S. Dept. of Commerce). :KDW\u0003WKLV\u0003EULHI\u0003KLVWRU\\\u0003GHPRQVWUDWHV\u0003LV\u0003WKDW\u0003WKH\u0003 legitimization of medical knowledge in America\u2014what is designated as worthy of study, what gets subsumed XQGHU\u0003WKH\u0003FDWHJRU\\\u0003RI\u0003\u00b4VFLHQFH\u000f\u00b5\u0003DQG\u0003ZKDW\u0003LV\u0003UHOHJDWHG\u0003 or dismissed to the alternative fringe\u2014has had much more to do with an inflection of power than the institu - tions of science/medicine and academia have so far, in any deeply significant way that trickles into the classrooms of our children, ventured to address.

(pp. 81-82). Years after I first began my healing practice, while I was still bemoaning the fact that I didn't really understand what I was doing and still worried that I could be accused of fakery and peddling of self-delusion, I learned that the Chinese not only had a name for what I was doing (Qigong), but had been practicing it for 4,000 years.

I am a Hawaiian woman of mixed blood, born less than ten years after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and raised in Kailua, O'ahu, Hawai'i. During the time of my childhood, the sugar and pineapple plantations were the main source of economic stability in the islands. The United States enacted statehood upon Hawai'i (1959), the nation it had conspired to overthrow with haole/foreigner businessmen and had been occupying (and is still occupying as of this writing) since 1893.

Their marriage was ar - ranged without either one knowing the finer details of the other. Grandfather had attained the highest honors of a gentleman scholar in what is now Seoul, Korea. He was revered for his position, the status of which was culturally represented by his wearing of a scholar's gat.7 The yangban (literati scholars) were an elite class, schooled in both classical and Neo-Confucian thought, who were dedicated to the Confucian ideals and aesthetic both in internal character as well as external practice. They were expected to hold public office and help cultivate and raise the standards of the society in which they lived and were highly respected for their knowledge and pursuits. \"Numerous texts were authored by members of the yangban class (which) provide insight into the ancient and contemporary texts they studied, the new ideas they developed, how they discoursed among themselves, and how they de - YHORSHG\u0003JRYHUQPHQW\u0003SROLFLHV\u00b5\u0003 /HH\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0013 \u0011\u00037KH\u0003\\DQJEDQ\u0003 wrote in Classic Chinese even after 1443, when the Korean han'g\u00fbl (alphabet) was developed. In a nearly untold story, discreetly handed down through my father to my brother, Japanese Soldiers one day barged into grandpa's class, killing a number of students and severely beating grandpa. The soldiers then dragged grandpa through the streets by his hair, degrading his gat (to symbolize debasement of Korean sensibilities, truth, and knowledge) and all but scalping him. Because a few of his students died and he wasn't also killed, and because he had been publicly \"scalped\" of his status, Grandpa suffered a great loss of face.8 He had two options to retain his honor: either kill himself, or leave Korea, never to return. He therefore, by dawn the next morning, took the first boat out of Korea. The boat was headed to Hawai'i, and in 1906, Grandpa landed at Koloa on the island of Kaua'i.9 My grandfather left his hair shorn for the remain - der of his life. He never again donned his Korean Literati attire, though he did become a Methodist preacher for the Korean population on the plantation. He never returned to Korea, and he never again saw his parents. Neither of my grandparents spoke English fluently and therefore, though both were (highly) educated in their own Korean tongue, they worked and lived most - ly on the plantation as common laborers for a large part of their adult lives. They birthed, in the process, seven children. Life on the plantation was difficult and Grandmother, who had been a teacher in Korea, lived on no more than three hours of sleep per night. She made her living doing laundry for the plantation work - ers, acting as mid-wife when called upon, and making kimchee10\u0003WR\u0003VHOO\u0011\u0003:H\u0003ZHUH\u0003WROG\u0003VKH\u0003ZDV\u0003WKH\u0003ILUVW\u0003SHUVRQ\u0003 to sell kimchee on the Ewa Plantation. Grandfather arose before dawn to work in the fields, but was fond of drinking and did not usually return home until after midnight. He also subsisted on less than four hours of sleep a night, but it was not because of his industrious nature. My father, Albert Kwong Ho Kim, the third child and first boy of the Yu-Kim marriage, was given all the leeway of the first son by his father, who was also a first son.

Thus began, as Johannes Fabian (1983) notes, the replacement of savages and cannibals in space (that is, in the colonies, in the new world, in Africa, etc.), with primitives and the exotic Other in an earlier time (that is, chronologically ordering native peoples to WKH\u0003\u00b4SULPLWLYH\u00b5\u0003DQG\u0003SULPDO\u0003EHJLQQLQJV\u0003RI\u0003KXPDQLW\\\u0003 and Orientals to early stage civilization).

To be clear, I do not imagine, nor do I advocate, an exclusive return to the ancient Hawaiian traditions, but neither can I accept the kind of Eurocentric thinking that ranks cultures and societies chronologically by ordering native peoples (and native knowledge) closer WR\u0003\u00b4SULPLWLYH\u00b5\u0003DQG\u0003(XURSHDQV\u0003FORVHU\u0003WR\u0003\u00b4HQOLJKWHQHG\u0011\u00b5\u0003 Johannes Fabian calls this transformation of the \u00b42WKHU\u00b5\u0003LQ\u0003VSDFH\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003\u00b42WKHU\u00b5\u0003LQ\u0003WLPH\u0003WKH\u0003 denial of coevalness (1983).

The scope of so called, legitimate knowledge from within the modern/ colonial world systems tradition and the means of knowledge acquisition and dissemination, though perhaps not in as obviously virulent a form, remains foundationally and predominantly an Occidental monotopic hermeneutic. The alienation, disempowerment, and psychic/ spiritual wounding that Hawaiians suffer as a result of this kind of institutionalized fragmentation, disenfranchisement, and ethnocide can be quantified by socio-economic and health indicators. In the 1980s and 1990s, Hawaiians were the most highly represented of the US population in high school dropout rates, incarceration rates, and \"overall mortality and death rates for heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes, and risk factors, such as obesity, K\\SHUWHQVLRQ\u0003DQG\u0003DOFRKRO\u0010XVH\u00ab\u00b5\u0003,Q\u0003\u0014 \u0013\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003OLIH\u0003 expectancy for Hawaiians continued to be the shortest of all ethnicities in Hawai'i; the age-adjusted mortality rates for all causes of death were higher than for any other ethnicity; with the exception of accidents, the five leading causes of death (heart disease, cancer, stroke, accidents, and diabetes) were highest for Hawaiians over any other ethnicity in Hawai'i; infant mortality rates were the highest: of reported cases of AIDs, Hawaiians ranked the highest (Blaisdell, 1997). These socio-economic and health indicators are similar to the numbers for the dispossessed and colonized native and black peoples across the US. Although the renewed movement towards Hawaiian sovereignty that began in the late 1970s is changing the trajectory of Hawaiians to a more mean - ingful, collective self destiny, Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiians) must still work through the tyranny of, as 1JXJL\u0003ZD\u00037KLRQJ\u00b7R\u0003FDOOV\u0003LW\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003\u00b4FXOWXUDO\u0003ERPE\u00b5\u0003 \u0014 \u0017\u000f\u0003 p. 3).

Bringing about health and healing has much to do with understanding wounding\u2014whether on 39 Ho'okul iwi a physical, emotional, psychological, spiritual or intellectual level; whether the wound is individually experienced or collectively perpetuated; whether the wound is historically, socially, or politically inflicted; intergenerationally or genetically transmitted; consciously or unconsciously, physically or non-physically, materially or immaterially communicated. One doesn't need a college degree to see that wounding happens on much more than just a biophysical level. Non-biophysical, immaterial wounding more often than not negatively impacts the biophysical level; which means, non physical healing can also positively impact the biophysical level .
