However, childhood vaccination coverage remains sub-optimal in many settings.While communication is a key feature of vaccination programmes, we are not aware of any comprehensive approach to organising the broad range of communication interventions that can be delivered to parents and communities to improve vaccination coverage. Developing a classification system (taxonomy) organised intoconceptually similar categories will aid in: understanding the relationships between different types of communication interventions; facilitating conceptual mapping of these interventions; clarifying the key purposes and features of interventions to aid implementation and evaluation; and identifying areas where evidence is strongand where there are gaps. This paper reports on the development of the 'Communicate to vaccinate 'taxonomy. Methods: The taxonomy was developed in two stages. Stage 1 included: 1) forming an advisory group; 2) searching for descriptions of interventions in trials (CENTRAL database) and general health literature (Medline); 3) developing a sampling strategy; 4) screening the search results; 5) developing a data extraction form; and 6) extracting intervention data. Stage 2 included: 1) grouping the interventions according to purpose; 2) holdingdeliberative forums in English and French with key vaccination stakeholders to gather feedback; 3) conducting a targeted search of grey literature to supplement the taxonomy; 4) finalising the taxonomy based on the input provided. Results: The taxonomy includes seven main categories of communication interventions: inform or educate, remind or recall, teach skills, provide support, facilitate decision making, enable communication and enhance community ownership. These categories are broken down into 43 intervention types across three target groups: parents orsoon-to-be-parents; communities, community members or volunteers; and health care providers. Conclusions: Our taxonomy illuminates and organises this field and identifies the range of available communication interventions to increase routine childhood vaccination uptake. We have utilised a variety of datasources, capturing information from rigorous evaluations such as randomised trials as well as experiences and knowledge of practitioners and vaccination stakeholders. The taxonomy reflects current public health practice and can guide the future development of vaccination programmes.

BMC International Health and Human Rights 2013, 13:23 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/13/23Background Vaccination is one of the most important public health achievements of the 20th century [1]. It is a cost-effectivepublic health measure and has led to the global eradication of smallpox and large reductions in poliomyelitis, measles, tetanus, rubella, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) [1] and other conditions. However, over 22 million children are still not fully vaccinated [2], and there are sig- nificant inequities in vaccination coverage within and be-tween countries [3]. Further, vaccination coverage rates in some countries are stagnating [4,5]. Efforts to improve vaccination coverage in low- and middle-income countries(LMICs) are central to meeting the Millennium Develop- ment Goal (MDG) of reducing child mortality [6]. Conceptualising communication in health Communication between and among health care pro- viders and consumers has been highlighted as an emer-ging field of importance within the health care landscape [7,8]. Active participation of, and effective communica- tion with, health care consumers has been demonstratedas a safe and efficient way to improve a broad range of health outcomes [9-12]. In the context of vaccination, communicating with parents and communities about thebenefits of vaccination empowers them to carry out ef- fective preventive health care, which in turn can increase vaccination uptake [13]. Historically, communication theorists have described the concept of communication as the linear journey a message takes from its source to its destination [14]. Sincethen, the concept of communication has evolved. The aims of communication are broad and so we use the term 'communication 'as a short hand term to describe the range of ways in which we 'seek patients, health con- sumers and family carers who are more knowledgeable and competent, able to express their views and beliefs,making choices alone or with health professionals, sup- ported or supportive, minimising risks and harms, accessing high quality information and quality services,and participating in policy, research, governance and de- livery '[15] (p.14). The implication is that communication may refer to actions an individual takes; an exchange be-tween two people, or interactions at the community level; and may encompass many media in addition to inter- action between people. For example, the evolution ofeHealth and mHealth, new forms of communication tech- nology, have led to greater levels of interpersonal connect- ivity [16-18]. In this project, we define a communicationintervention as a 'purposeful, planned and formalised strategy associated with a diverse range of intentions or aims '[19] (p.30). The concept of 'purposeful, planned and formalised 'derives from the principles of evidence-based health care, where knowledge of an intervention 's effects on specific outcomes is a primary goal [15]. Further,recognition of the multidirectionality of communication promotes an understanding that meaningful communica- tion associated with specific health purposes may originateas much from health consumers as it may from health care providers [20]. The 'Communicate acknowledges the important role of communicationin health and aims to clarify and build upon the available evidence of communication interventions to improve vaccination uptake in LMICs [22]. The project has sixsub-studies, as outlined in Figure 1. Despite the importance of communication to vaccine delivery and uptake we were unable to find any pub-lished comprehensive approaches to organising, and therefore understanding, the full range of communica- tion interventions related to childhood vaccination. Inparticular, we were unable to identify any approaches which took into account the range of ways in which communication is facilitated [22]. We aimed to meet thisneed through the development of a taxonomy -a classi- fication system organised into categories based on con- ceptual or practical similarities - of communicationinterventions. We believe that this taxonomy will help to understand the relationships between different types of interventions in the field. The taxonomy will also form abasis for future conceptual mapping of these interven- tions. This, in turn, will help to clarify their key purposes and features, assist with implementation and evaluationand identify areas where evidence is strong and where there are gaps [22-24]. We have seen a recent surge in the use of taxonomies to organise other areas of knowledge such as consumers ' medicines use [25], falls prevention strategies [26], barriers to the acceptance of office systems [27], health systems in-terventions [28] and behaviour change techniques [29]. The objective of this stage of the COMMVAC project was to develop a formal taxonomy of communication in-terventions for routine childhood vaccination, and this article outlines our methods. Methods Figure 2 summarises the methods used to develop the COMMVAC taxonomy. There were two main stages:Stage 1 focused on searching for and selecting interven- tions; Stage 2 involved developing the taxonomy, con- sulting on drafts of the work and finalising thetaxonomy. Both stages included a number of key tasks, which are described in detail below. Stage 1: search for and select interventions The objective of Stage 1 was to identify, classify and group the complete range of communication interventionsWillis et al.

BMC International Health and Human Rights 2013, 13:23 Page 3 of 16 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/13/23focused on routine childhood vaccination, involving six key tasks. Key task 1: form the advisory group The COMMVAC project partners invited an inter- national group of vaccination and communication ex- perts to form an advisory group to provide commentand feedback on different aspects of the project. Repre- sentatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Union for Health Promotion and Edu-cation (IUHPE), the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI Alliance), the Cameroon Public Health Association and the Norwegian KnowledgeCentre for the Health Services advised on the direction and implementation of the project and interpretation of findings. The advisory group provided specific advice onthe organisation of the taxonomy and on the degree to which it reflected the experiences of those working in the vaccination and communication fields. Key task 2: search for interventions We obtained the interventions used to formulate thetaxonomy from a variety of sources. We retrieved pub- lished trials and medical literature from two databases: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials(CENTRAL) and Medline. CENTRAL is a comprehen- sive databases of trials on the effects of health interven- tions and we therefore anticipated that it would yield ahigh proportion of relevant interventions. However, not all communication interventions have been evaluated in trials and new interventions are constantly being devel-oped. We therefore also searched Medline without any study design filter so as to retrieve any kind of paper de- scribing a communication intervention for vaccination.We developed search strategies for Medline and CEN- TRAL (Additional files 1 and 2) based on Cochrane Col- laboration principles [30]. The strategies included index terms and text word combinations that were associatedwith vaccination, based on an approach developed in a related project [31], and combinations associated with communication. Communication terms were derivedfrom the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Re- view Group 's (CC&CRG) scope and included all terms associated with people 's interactions with the health sys- tem or about their health, such as communication, health education, information provision, decision making and media communication [32]. In addition to these sources, we identified interven- tions based on the experiential and practice knowledge of key experts in the field of vaccination and communi-cation. We gathered this information through a series of deliberative forums held in June and July 2011 and through the advisory group. Lastly, we supplemented thesystematic search for studies indexed in CENTRAL and Medline with purposeful hand searching of the grey lit- erature available on the internet and through major health agencies. These last two steps were conducted in Stage 2 (see below). Key task 3: develop a sampling strategy We developed a sampling strategy because the Medlinesearch produced greater than 10 000 records. Weperformed a sample size calculation in order to reduce the high yield of articles while maintaining a sample size cap- able of answering our research question. Our goal was tocapture the complete range of unique interventions de- scribed by these records. We screened a small subset of 100 Medline articles and found one unique interventionFigure 2 COMMVAC taxonomy methods.Willis et al. BMC International Health and Human Rights 2013, 13:23 Page 4 of 16 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/13/23type in every fifty articles (as well as many articles that de- scribed intervention types already identified), i.e., 2% of the subset sample constituted unique vaccination commu-nication interventions. To account for any variation in the subset, we rounded up and estimated that we would find a new intervention in 5% of records. We used a sample sizecalculator to determine with 95% confidence and 90% pre- cision that we would need to screen 1002 records from the Medline search output in order to capture all relevantnew interventions. We then organised the Medline search results chronologically according to publication date and used a random number generator programme to choose anumber between 1 and 19. This number was eight. From the eighth article in the list, we selected every 19th article. This resulted in a sample of 1002 articles from Medline. Key task 4: screen the search results We developed selection criteria and applied them to ar-ticles identified from CENTRAL and Medline, to inter- ventions identified from the grey literature, as well as those obtained from key stakeholders participating inthe deliberative forums. The selection criteria were that the article: 1. Identified or mentioned a communication intervention, consistent with the COMMVAC definition of communication [ 19,22] 2. Described a target population of children up to six years of age. Articles in which the target population age was not described but could potentially includechildren up to six years old were included 3. Reported on childhood vaccination and included communication with parents or communities.Interventions directed to health care providers were only included if they directly impacted on interactions with consumers 4. Focused on routine childhood vaccines only, defined by WHO 's recommendations for all children [ 33] 5. Was written in English. Non-English records were not included as the project did not have the resources to translate full text papers published in other languages. Two researchers (NW and JK) independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility, retrieving full text re-cords if insufficient information was available. Discrep- ancies were resolved through discussion or by involving a third researcher (SH). Key task 5: develop a data extraction form We developed a data extraction form (see Additional file 3),building on the data extraction form recommended for authors of systematic reviews for the CC&CRG [34]. We piloted the form within the project team to ensure ease ofuse and clarity. The final form contained the following data extraction cells: 1. Article features /C15Type of study 2. Population features /C15Population group/s /C15Setting/s of vaccination services (i.e. country andregion, urban or rural) /C15Details of vaccines and coverage /C15Age of infants or children 3. Communication intervention features /C15Intervention purpose /C15Direction of communication (i.e. the target of theintervention) /C15Parties involved /C15Content of communication /C15Format and delivery method /C15Deliverer (i.e. service type or personnel) /C15Training required /C15Setting/s /C15Frequency or timing of communication /C15Cost 4. Outcome features /C15Main outcomes measured (where applicable). Key task 6: extract the data Data on the communication interventions identified were extracted by two researchers (NW and JK) and en- tered into the data extraction form in Microsoft Word. For trials, we extracted whatever information was available about the communication intervention being evaluated, along with outcomes features. Much of thisinformation was intended to be utilised in later stages of the project, as the focus of the taxonomy was primarily on intervention type and purpose. For other types of ar-ticles, we extracted any information reported on all of the communication interventions described in the art- icle, even if some interventions were only mentionedbriefly. The rationale behind this was to ensure that in- terventions that have not necessarily been evaluated but which are being implemented in the field were capturedin the taxonomy. For example, interventions involving the community in vaccination programmes [35], or the use of celebrities in promoting an important vaccinationmessage [36], can be integral features of vaccination strategies despite being under-represented in trial research. Stage 2: develop the taxonomy, consult and finalise The objective of Stage 2 was to develop and finalise thetaxonomy through extensive consultation with key com- munication and vaccination stakeholders. We conducted a thorough search of the grey literature in this stage toWillis et al. BMC International Health and Human Rights 2013, 13:23 Page 5 of 16 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/13/23help achieve this objective, along with the other key tasks described below. Key task 1: group the interventions Once all the available data were extracted, we compiled a complete list of interventions in Microsoft Excel in which we described each intervention using simple, non- technical terms. This 'raw 'interventions list became the launching pad for our taxonomy. By discussing common themes and features in this list, NW, JK and SH grouped interventions conceptually according to their purpose. Wethen developed a coding system to organise and manage these data. Once the interventions were grouped, the major overarching categories in the taxonomy wereformed. In establishing the purpose of interventions we were guided by the language used by the authors of the ar- ticles, rather than imposing our own interpretations. Theoverarching primary categories were then further divided to provide greater clarity and definition between the dif- ferent intervention types. In developing the COMMVAC taxonomy, we built on taxonomies already developed by the project partners, including: (1) a comprehensive taxonomy for all inter-ventions for communication in health [37]; and (2) a taxonomy of interventions directed to consumers for evidence-based prescribing [25]. We also referred toAbraham and Michie 's taxonomy of behaviour change techniques [29] and a global evidence mapping initiative led by Bragge and colleagues [23]. This initial version of the taxonomy (Table 1) com- prised seven categories and 34 intervention types. The original categories were: inform or educate; remind orrecall; teach skills; support; minimise risks and harms; increase access to or likelihood of contact with health care/vaccination services and; involve the community inplanning, programme delivery, research, advocacy or governance. This version of the taxonomy was presented to a series of deliberative forums and to the advisorygroup for comment. It included a range of examples for each intervention type to assist participants in under- standing what might be included in each category. Key task 2: hold deliberative forums Consulting vaccination and communication experts togather their unique practice perspectives was an import- ant step in refining the taxonomy, and one that has been commonly adopted in the development of other taxon-omies [22,26,38-40]. We presented the initial version of the taxonomy to a range of international stakeholders at deliberative forums. Stakeholders included representa-tives of governmental and non-governmental agencies, consumer groups, as well as experts in the field of vac- cination and communication.The deliberative forums included two face to face consultations convened in New York and Ottawa (see Additional file 4) and one online forum. Materials weretranslated into French for the Ottawa and online forums. Project partners based in Melbourne and Cape Town moderated the online forum, posting discussion ques-tions related to the taxonomy and collating and translat- ing the views of forum participants between French and English where necessary. Participants were asked to comment on whether the categories and their organisation were logical and whether any interventions were missing. These consulta-tions were also pivotal in the identification and formula- tion of topics for systematic reviews of the effects of communication interventions for vaccination, currentlybeing completed as part of COMMVAC sub-study 4 (see Figure 1) [16,41]. Key task 3: search the grey literature We conducted a focussed search of the grey literature in order to complement database searching. Websites wereselected following extensive discussions within the project team, with input from the advisory group. We searched the websites of the Communication Initiative Network,World Health Organization (WHO), United Nation Chil- dren 's Funds (UNICEF), Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI Alliance), Immunization Basics,Programme for Appropriate Technologies in Health (PATH), Centre for Global Health Communication and Marketing, US Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion (CDC), and the Maternal and Child Health Integrated Programme (MCHIP). New or unique interventions de- scribed by these sources were added to existing taxonomycategories where appropriate, or used to refine new tax- onomy categories. Key task 4: finalise the taxonomy based on the input provided A core group of the project team consisting of NW, SH and JK revised the initial taxonomy based on feedback from project partners, the advisory group and delibera- tive forum participants. Apart from identifying interventions not already cap- tured in the taxonomy, the advisory group and delibera- tive forum participants suggested a variety of differentways to organise the initial version of the taxonomy, as well as different features to be incorporated. Two over- arching messages emerged from the feedback processand greatly influenced the taxonomy. The first message was that the taxonomy needed to more clearly identify the person or people (e.g. con-sumers, health care providers) to whom the intervention is delivered. In response to this feedback, we changed the structure of the taxonomy by adding columnsWillis et al.

BMC International Health and Human Rights 2013, 13:23 Page 7 of 16 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/13/23identifying the target of interventions in order to better differentiate between parents or soon to be parents, communities and health care providers. We did not feelthat identifying the deliverer would be helpful or pos- sible, however, as health care messages can be multidir- ectional and may involve a range of different peopledepending on the health care context [20]. The second recommendation was to make clearer the taxonomy 's scope and parameters. As the focus was on communication interventions, the feedback raised ques- tions about the appropriateness of including interven- tions such as the delivery of free vaccines or incentivesfor general practitioners. We agreed that the taxonomy would only incorporate interventions that either im- pacted on the provider-consumer interaction or involvedcommunication with, and participation of, parents, care- givers and community members. However, drawing this line in practice was challenging, particularly in terms ofthe recurring issue of distinguishing between supply-side (funding of vaccines) and demand-side (education of parents) interventions. We produced a Venn diagram(Figure 3) to convey visually which interventions we in- cluded and excluded. As the scope of the taxonomy became clearer through these consultations and diagrammatic representation, we removed various categories and intervention types that did not involve communication with parents and com-munities. For example, we removed the \"Increase access to or likelihood of contact with health care/vaccinationservices \"category, along with intervention types contained in this category, such as \"Opportunistic vaccination \"and \"Free vaccines. \" In addition to these major changes, we made several smaller alterations based on the input gathered from forum participants and advisory group members. To bet-ter reflect the experiences and goals described by people working in vaccine programmes in LMICs, we changed the language surrounding the community involvementcategory from \"To involve the community in planning, programme delivery, research, advocacy or governance \"to \"Enhance community ownership \". We added the concept of\"building trust \"into the definition of this category and included \"local opinion leaders \"as an intervention type after forum participants highlighted the importance of ad-vocacy toward community and religious leaders. We also added \"addressing misinformation \"to the definition of \"To inform or educate \" We then held further deliberations within the project team to agree on the final taxonomy. Through this itera- tive process, we have attempted to ensure that: appropri-ate definitions and language are used and category descriptions are clear and relevant; the taxonomy repre- sents global activity as well as LMIC experiences; inter-ventions for which evaluations were not found are identified; and interventions currently being used in practice are highlighted. In the following section we describe the search results and final taxonomy in detail.

BMC International Health and Human Rights 2013, 13:23 Page 8 of 16 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/13/23Results We conducted searches in CENTRAL (October 5th 2010 - 556 records) and Medline (December 6th 2010 -27 061 records). After excluding duplicates, non-English language and non-relevant articles, we were left with 19 027 poten-tially eligible Medline records (Figure 4). As the number of articles retrieved from Medline was above the thresh- old that we set of 10 000 articles, we applied the sam-pling approach described above prior to screening. This resulted in 1002 records. After screening, 117 eligible re- cords were identified from Medline. After excluding duplicates 548 CENTRAL records remained and were screened, resulting in 104 eligiblerecords. Full text papers were then obtained for the total 221 records, which provided information on 43 unique intervention types covering 471descriptions of interventions. We will now describe the final 'Communicate to vac- cinate 'taxonomy. The 'Communicate to vaccinate 'taxonomy The purposes of communication interventions serve as the central classification method in our final taxonomy(Figure 5). We chose to organise the 'Communicate to vaccinate 'taxonomy in this way as the intended aim, or purpose, of an action is an integral feature of any com-munication intervention [19] and is ultimately the main determinant of what one does in practice. The taxonomy Figure 4 Exclusion flowchart for records contributing to the development of the COMMVAC taxonomy.Willis et al. BMC International Health and Human Rights 2013, 13:23 Page 9 of 16 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/13/23includes definitions of the seven main communication purposes: inform or educate; remind or recall; teach skills; provide support; facilitate decision making; enable communication; and enhance community ownership.Within these categories, the interventions are broken down into 43 types and are also categorised according to their main target: parents or soon to be parents; com-munities, community members or volunteers; and health care providers (Figure 6). We summarise below the main overarching 'interven- tion purpose 'categories in the taxonomy and provide ex- amples of the interventions included in these categories. An expanded version of the taxonomy including cat- egory definitions, intervention types and examples is available on the COMMVAC project website [21]. Inform or educate Communication interventions in this category are tai-lored towards empowering parents and communities tounderstand the benefit and relevance of vaccination to their health and the health of their family and commu- nity. Informing and educating parents and communitieshas several underlying aims. These include addressing misinformation and poor knowledge regarding the prac- tical and logistical factors associated with vaccination.This is achieved in a wide range of ways. For example, nurses or vaccine providers can communicate directly with children about vaccines through methods such as puppet shows [42]. Letters/emails, pamphlets, telephonecalls/text messages and face to face interactions are typ- ically targeted towards parents or soon to be parents [43-46], whereas television documentaries, immunisationcarnivals and media campaigns can be used to dissemin- ate information to entire communities [36,42,47]. Remind or recall Interventions in this category prompt parents of upcom- ing or overdue vaccinations through a variety of deliverymechanisms and evolving forms of technology. Letters/ emails, telephone calls/text messages, face to face inter- actions or tools (e.g. fridge magnets) are all mechanismsby which parents can be reminded to have their child vaccinated [48-50]. Health care providers can also be reminded of due vaccinations at specific health appoint-ments. These reminders usually take the form of chart prompts or alerts at the point of care, thus influencing the parent-provider interaction [51]. Provider remindersthat do not occur at the point of care are not included in this taxonomy as they do not directly affect interac- tions between providers and parents. Figure 5 COMMVAC taxonomy purposes and definitions.Willis et al. BMC International Health and Human Rights 2013, 13:23 Page 10 of 16 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/13/23Teach skills Interventions that aim to teach parents, communities and health care providers the skills required to operationalise knowledge are an important component of communica- tion. Parenting skills programmes are located within thiscategory. Parents are taught various skills related to child health such as breast feeding, oral rehydration and general parenting skills. Early childhood vaccination is often an in-tegral component of these programmes, which not only include an educational element but also guidance for par- ents on how to ensure their child is vaccinated appropri-ately. Another important feature of this category isinterventions aimed at training parents, communities and health care providers in how to communicate or provideeducation to others. This can include suggestions for how a mother can communicate to her child to reduce stress at vaccination appointments [52] or the training of localhealth workers in how to educate others [53]. Provide support Communication interventions typically described in theliterature as providing support to parents are important aspects of vaccination uptake. Their purpose is to pro- vide assistance or advice to parents outside of the Figure 6 COMMVAC taxonomy of interventions to improve communication about childhood vaccination.Willis et al. BMC International Health and Human Rights 2013, 13:23 Page 11 of 16 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/13/23traditional consultation environment about vaccination. Support and information exchange between parents via an online chat forum is an example [54]. Facilitate decision making Interventions that are specifically described as decision aids for parents were classified separately as these tools have a wider purpose than simply educating or informinga parent about vaccination. Decision aids are evidence- based tools that prepare consumers to make decisions when confronted with multiple health care [12]. Enable communication This is a narrowly defined category which includes inter-ventions that aim to make communication between par- ents and health care providers possible, specifically in the face of a practical obstacle such as disability or a lan-guage difference. For example, the use of interpreters to translate important vaccination messages is a unique intervention type that is more purposeful than simplytranslating information [55]. Enhance community ownership Interventions included in this category aim to enhance in-teractions between communities and health services as away of achieving better awareness and fostering a sense of community ownership of vaccination. Community partici- pation in all aspects of vaccination programme delivery,planning, research or governance may contribute to build- ing trust among consumers. Community involvement and grassroots support for vaccination programmes may alsoinfluence the uptake of vaccination on a community-wide scale. Interventions in this category include: community coalitions charged with overseeing the implementation ofvaccination programmes; enlisting local opinion leaders such as village chiefs to serve as vaccination 'champions '; recruiting village members to assist with vaccinationprogramme delivery; or community input into the design of vaccination strategies [47,56-58]. Discussion Communication is an important component of vaccin- ation programmes, alongside service delivery, logistics,vaccine supply and surveillance and may also provide opportunities for other health promotion messages and activities. Developing a classification system based onconceptual similarities among communication interven- tions will help to: clarify the key purposes and features of interventions; introduce a common language of com-munication interventions in the vaccination field; and assist with the conceptualisation of communication as an intervention in its own right.Limitations and areas where further work is needed We developed the taxonomy with extensive input from arange of knowledgeable individuals, but some of theirsuggestions fell outside the scope of the taxonomy and were therefore not incorporated in the final structure. We discuss below these areas where further work maybe needed. Reframing the taxonomy according to known vaccination barriers Some advisory group members and forum participants suggested that it may be useful to reframe the taxonomyaccording to known vaccination barriers, making the taxonomy a 'menu 'of solutions to common barriers. Garner and colleagues [59] conducted a similar mappingexercise to link known barriers to adherence to tubercu- losis treatment to relevant interventions, so as to \"help policy makers and providers think through the barriersand determine how best to address them \"(p.404). We did not attempt this here for several reasons: first, it would have required a separate extensive review of thesubstantial 'barriers 'literature, which was not be feasible given project resources. Second, when extracting data to develop the taxonomy it quickly became apparent thatthe available literature on interventions generally omits information related to barriers to vaccination uptake. Third, assumptions often need to be made to link knownbarriers to certain interventions. For example, when demonstrating the link between a barrier and an inter- vention, Garner and colleagues [59] state that: \"staff training probably tackles health-system barriers by im- proving the quality of health care \"(p. 404. Emphasis added), and that their own judgement was required tolink some barriers to interventions. This, we felt, would make barrier mapping a subjective task unless substan- tive work could be done to explore the extent to whichinterventions address specific barriers. Last, a major philosophical concern with organising interventions around the central theme of barriers is that it assumesthat all interventions are designed or intended to over- come opposition, resistance or hindrances to vaccin- ation. However, information interventions, for instance,may primarily be used to inform parents - a purpose shared by other early parenting interventions -who can then make informed choices regarding vaccination up-take. Such interventions may focus on vaccination as a public good rather than on attempting to overcome spe- cific barriers to vaccination uptake. We therefore feltthat a barrier analysis may be a useful secondary analysis but not as a primary organising framework. Clarifying who delivers the interventions A forum participant requested that the taxonomy in- corporate \"who does what to whom \". This would involveWillis et al. BMC International Health and Human Rights 2013, 13:23 Page 12 of 16 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/13/23describing who delivers the intervention, what the inter- vention is and who the intervention is directed to. How- ever, increasingly interventions are being delivered by amix of health professionals and lay health workers [60] or using communication mediums such as the internet and mobile phones. This meant that this informationdid not aid the central purpose of classification, although we extracted data where possible on these items and this information could aid a detailed map of specific inter-vention types. Outlining how interventions change social norms One participant suggested the inclusion of \"Changing social norms \"as an additional taxonomy category. How- ever, one could argue that changing a social normapplies to most interventions to increase vaccination coverage. For instance, vaccination can be viewed as in- effective or dangerous - a social norm or belief sharedby some in the community. An intervention to educate parents or communities about the safety and effective- ness of vaccination is intended in part to change this so-cial norm. We therefore did not consider it useful to include \"changing social norms \"as a category within the taxonomy, but further work is needed to explore howthese different groups of interventions change beliefs and behaviours [29,61]. Specifying the contextual elements that contribute to the effectiveness of interventions A member of the advisory group proposed that the tax- onomy specify the preconditions, or contextual elements, that contribute to the effectiveness of communication in- terventions for vaccination. These include institutionalsystems; cultural, political and economic environments; as well as the presence of supporting factors, such as legisla- tion. Unfortunately, these preconditions are rarely de-scribed in the literature and their inclusion was therefore not feasible. Further primary research in this area is needed. Examining the gender dimensions of all studies Lastly, it was suggested that the taxonomy incorporatethe gender dimensions of all included interventions. While an analysis of gender roles and responsibilities would be interesting, it was not possible to include thisin the taxonomy for similar reasons to those outlined for contextual elements. Other limitations There are a number of important elements of communi- cation interventions that this taxonomy is not intendedto describe or categorise, including the content of the communication; how the communication happens, for example, the nature of the interpersonal communicationinvolved, which may include empathic listening; the characteristics of the target population; the outcome measures used; the setting, timing or frequency of theintervention; or the level of health system involvement. These intervention features are being further explored in the evidence map phase of this project (sub-study 3 -see Figure 1), to the extent that this data is available. Another possible limitation of the taxonomy is that it does not include a category for multifaceted interventions-rather, these were separated into their individual com- ponents for classification. For example, we separated in- terventions involving both reminders and education intotwo interventions because the purpose of this taxonomy is to provide a system of discrete categories into which each kind of communication intervention can be classified, soas to describe and clarify the purposes and features of each. Of course, evaluations of such multifaceted interven- tions may need to consider both the effectiveness of thepackage as a whole and the contributions of the key components. Finally, resource constraints limited our search to arti- cles published in English only. This means that we could not address the varied sociocultural approaches to com- munication around the world, and further research onthis would be useful. It is also possible that we missed interventions unique to non English-speaking country settings. Acknowledging our resource constraints, weattempted to address this limitation in part by including participants from Francophone African countries in one of the deliberative forums and by making the onlineforum accessible to French speakers, with materials and discussion summaries translated into French. This ex- panded the scope of the project to include input fromrepresentatives in several additional African countries where vaccination is a critical issue. Implications for research and practice The 'Communicate to vaccinate 'taxonomy, which incor- porates the principles of evidence-informed publichealth and is guided by current practice, has a number of implications for research and practice. Firstly, it will assist both researchers and practitioners in identifyingthe key purposes of communication interventions. This new way of organising interventions will help people to design communication initiatives based on the goal orpurpose of the communication, cutting across the myr- iad different intervention formats and ever-changing forms of communication technology. Secondly, it maycontribute to improving and standardising the descrip- tion of communication interventions in the vaccination field, thereby improving the information available to vac-cination programme managers and to researchers. Thirdly, as evidence of effectiveness is mapped against the interventions in this taxonomy, the product willWillis et al. BMC International Health and Human Rights 2013, 13:23 Page 13 of 16 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/13/23assist in selecting for implementation those interven- tions shown to be effective, as well as in identifying evi- dence gaps. Fourth, and following from this, researcherswill be able to use this taxonomy to facilitate evidence mapping, a relatively new method of identifying where evidence is located and where future research should beconducted to close evidence gaps [23]. As undertaking new primary research in the absence of a comprehensive synthesis of existing knowledge is wasteful [62], evidencemapping based on a comprehensive taxonomy of inter- ventions can aid in the prioritisation of future research. In addition, the process of developing the taxonomy hasidentified a number of research questions (e.g. mapping theoretical perspectives of interventions), as discussed in more detail above. Conclusions There is a substantial body of knowledge on communi- cation in the field of childhood vaccination, but to date this has been difficult to navigate. To address this, wehave developed a taxonomy of communication interven- tions for vaccination, which outlines seven main inter- vention categories: inform or educate, remind or recall,teach skills, provide support, facilitate decision making, enable communication and enhance community owner- ship. This taxonomy both illuminates and organises thisarea of work and identifies the range of communication interventions that programme managers might utilise to increase routine childhood vaccination uptake. In devel-oping the taxonomy, we have utilised a variety of data sources, capturing not only high quality trial research but also the experiences and knowledge of practitionersand key vaccination stakeholders. As a result, we believe that the taxonomy reflects the complete range of 'Com- municate to vaccinate 'interventions currently in practice globally and will be an important guide for the future development of vaccination programmes.
