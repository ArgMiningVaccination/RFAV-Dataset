Holistic therapy refers to those treatments and therapies that help improve the wellbeing of the whole person; mind, body, soul/spirit and emotions. \"Where the spirit suffers, the body suffers too\" There are a number of different types of crystals, that are believed to be filled with healing abilities, each one having different properties and focus on a different area of your physical and spiritual wellbeing. Crystals radiate vibrational frequencies, much like humans, and can be used to shift, absorb and diffuse energies within the body, they promote the positive flow of energy, help to rid the body and mind of negative energy and release blocked energy (such as trauma). As well as identifying which crystal suits your individual needs, you should also look for which ones you're drawn to. It is also important to note that crystal healing practices do not completely replace therapy or professional help. How to use: Crystals/Gemstones can be used in numerous ways, they can be worn as jewellery, used as part of a holistic practice (such as, yoga, Reiki or meditation), you can carry them with you, in your pocket, on your desk or even under your pillow.
