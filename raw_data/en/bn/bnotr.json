Since the COVID-19 pandemic, most people are at home while it is still unsafe to be around large groups of people frequently. Indeed, this means people are not able to build up immunity to new cold and flu viruses. As a result, they are more likely to become sick. Luckily, chiropractic care is an effective, affordable approach to build up your immune system and avoid those sick days. With a stronger immune system, you can achieve better overall health and wellness. Before we begin discussing the power of chiropractic care, let's quickly go over what your immune system is and why it's crucial for your overall health and wellness. Your Immune System The immune system contains different proteins, tissues, organs, and white blood cells that work together to keep you healthy. This system protects and defends against infectious germs, prevents these germs from entering your body, and thus, making you sick. Strong immune systems prevent harmful germs from making you sick, compared to a weak immune system that cannot fight off these germs that make you sick. What Prevents Your Immune System from Working Properly? Here are some factors: - Autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system attacks itself as it would with a foreign organism - Allergic disorders, in which the immune system overreacts to a certain allergen, making people feel sick - Cancer - Immunodeficiency disorder - Stress Your Nervous System Controls Your Immune System Your nervous system controls your body's functions and directly communicates through the spinal cord. If there is spinal damage or misalignment, this affects your nervous system. In turn, this interferes with the brain to body communication. This can increase your likelihood to experience pain, injury, and illness. Also, when the nervous system isn't functioning properly, this affects your immune system and makes it more difficult for your body to naturally fight off illnesses and recover from injuries. With a weakened immune system, this increases your chances of becoming sick with the cold, flu, and other illnesses. How Can Chiropractic Care Boost Your Immune System? Being sick is never fun, especially when you don't have time to take sick days. How can you boost your immunity against those pesky germs? One solution is chiropractic care, which doesn't use drugs or invasive surgeries to be effective. Studies have proven that chiropractic care can improve patients' nerve functions and strengthen their immune system by 200 percent. Wow! This explains how people that regularly receive chiropractic adjustments are usually healthier and less likely to get sick during cold and flu seasons. By using neurologically-based chiropractic care, our chiropractors can identify and fix dysfunctions in the body that are compromising your body's ability to heal itself and fight off infectious germs. When those misalignments are fixed at the source, the nervous system can then work correctly and let the immune system do its job - fighting off illnesses and quickly recovering from injuries. As you can see, the nervous system and immune system are all connected and play key roles in your overall health.
