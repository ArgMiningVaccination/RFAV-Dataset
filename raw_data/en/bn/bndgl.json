Most of the time these must be addressed without navigation tools or clear algorithms for the mechanisms of reactions. There are few standardized skin tests/invitrotests for diagnosis and rare validated desensitization protocols. Drug testing and desensitization should be considered on the basisof consensus reports (International Consensus [ICON], Interna-tional Collaboration in Asthma, Allergy and Immunology [ICALL], Practical Allergy [PRACTALL]) as well as practice pa- rameters. However, new and targeted drugs that better addressdiseases in a precise and personalized fashion are emerging rapidly, and they induce new, unpredictable, and poorly understood re- actions. This publication was born out of a grassroots need toprovide the seeds of a new discipline: the understanding, diagnosis,management, and treatment of drug allergy and hypersensitivity as a practical clinical endeavor. Dr Thomas Fleisher embraced this as his presidential theme, as mentioned in the Introduction section of this supplement. In theGeneral Concepts article in this supplement, Drs Ana Dioun Broyles, Aleena Banerji, and Mariana Castells provided in describing the phenotypes, endotypes, and bio- markers of drug reactions, amplifying the Gell and Coombs classication and providing practical algorithms for the diagnosis and management. 1The lead authors next consulted drug hyper- sensitivity experts from around the world to precisely de ne speci c drugs and/or drug classes regarding the phenotypic presentations ofreactions, diagnostic tools such as skin testing, in vitro testing, and challenges, and the best management and treatment approaches including desensitization. The numerous authors who contributedto this section of the supplement have provided the most current information on and the standards for in vitro andin vivo testing and desensitization procedures when these exist. Their efforts haveresulted in an accurate compilation of drug hypersensitivity pro-cedures data that can be applied in a personalized fashion to each drug-allergic patient. The hope is that this supplement will provide a user-friendly in- strument that will be used in clinics, hospitals, wards, and theemergency department on a daily basis, and that its principles will guide and increase allergist immunologists 'skills and level of comfort with a practical approach to drug hypersensitivity.

It is also hoped thathis resource will be updated every 2 to 3 years with new developments that arise in the diagnosis and management of drug hypersensitivity so as to continue to improve the quality and safety of care. ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS Penicillins (by Timothy Lax, MD, and AntoninoRomano, MD) General. Penicillins are commonly used to treat infections caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Penicillin al- lergy is one of the most commonly reported drug allergies, with a prevalence of 5% to 10%.2,3The reported prevalence is higher among hospitalized patients, at 11% to 15%.4,5Individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity are more likely to receivealternative antibiotic therapy, which can lead to added expense, iiDivision of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Respiratory Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va jjDivision of Allergy, Immunology and Pulmonology, Monroe Carell Jr. Children 's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tenn kkDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy, and Sleep, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, San Francisco, Calif llDivision of Allergic Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn mmDivision of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass nnDepartment of Medicine & Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn ooDivision of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Canada Children 's Hospital, Boston, Mass qqDivision of Immunology, Boston Children 's Hospital, Boston, Mass rrDrug Allergy Department, Al-Rashed Allergy Center, Sulaibikhat, Catania, Italy ttDivision of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn uuAllergy Unit and Research Group, Hospital Regional Universitario de M\u00e1laga, Spain wwDivision of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Brigham and Women 's Hospital, Boston, Mass xxDivision of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Brigham and Women 's Hospital, Boston, Mass yyDivision of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass zzDivision of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass aaaDivision of Immunology, Boston Children 's Hospital, Boston, Mass bbbDivision of Allergy/Immunology, Boston Children 's Hospital, Boston, Mass cccDrug hypersensitivity and Desensitization Center, Brigham and Women 's Hos- pital, Boston, MassConflicts of interest: K.

Approximately 90%to 95% of patients with a reported penicillin allergy can tolerate a rechallenge after an appropriate allergy evaluation has been per- formed. 8,9The discrepancy between reported and actual peni- cillin allergy may be explained by the waning of penicillin IgE antibodies over time or by the misclassi cation of an adverse reaction or infectious manifestation as a drug reaction.10-12 Sensitization to penicillin has been reported to decrease every 10years, and after 20 years fewer than 1% of patients with initial clinical symptoms compatible with an allergic reaction continue to maintain their sensitivity. Therefore, a formal allergy evaluation is recommended by both North American and European guidelinesto optimize patient management. 13-15 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Hypersensitivity reactions to penicillin are classi able as immediate or nonimmediate according to their clinical manifestation, time since the last drug administration, and the onset of symptoms.16,17Immediate re- actions are predominantly IgE-mediated. They can occur within 6 hours after the last drug administration but typically occur within 1hour of the rst dose of a new treatment course. 17,18Symptoms of an acute hypersensitivity reaction include urticaria, angioedema,conjunctivitis, respiratory symptoms (rhinitis, bronchospasm,cough, dyspnea), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), and/or anaphylaxis. 16 Nonimmediate reactions occur more than 1 hour after the initial drug exposure, and they often develop days to weeks after medicationinitiation. Manifestations of nonimmediate reactions include mac- (SJS) and toxicepidermal necrolysis (TEN). Furthermore, hematologic alterations may occur with certain penicillins, such as methicillin and ampicillin, and can cause interstitial nephritis , pneumonitis, hepatitis, and/or vasculitis with or without signs of serum sickness including joint involvement. The combination of skin eruptions, visceral involve- ment, hematologic alteration, fever, and lymphadenopathy is termeddrug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome or drug rash (or reaction) with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). The pathogenic mechanisms involved in nonimmediate reactions are heterogeneous.Allergic maculopapular exanthems which drug-speci c cytotoxic CD4 T cells migrate into the skin. These T cells then produce IL-5 and kill keratinocytes that presentMHC class II molecules in a perforin-dependent manner. 19,20 Diagnosis. Based on the clinical history and presenting symptoms, there are distinct diagnostic approaches for an im- mediate reaction and for a nonimmediate reaction to penicillin. For patients with a history of TEN, SJS, DRESS, interstitial nephritis, or hemolytic anemia, reexposure through either drugchallenge or desensitization is contraindicated, unless there are special circumstances. Immediate reactions. Penicillins contain a core bicyclic structure that is composed of a 4-member b-lactam ring and a 5- member thiazolidine ring along with 1 side chain (R1) ( Figure 1 ). Although too small to be antigenic in its native state, penicillin gainsimmunogenicity by spontaneously degrading and covalently bindingto tissue or serum proteins to form haptens. 21Approximately 95% of penicillin degrades to form a penicilloyl complex, which is called themajor determinant. 21,22The remaining penicillin remains in its native form (benzylpenicillin) or degrades further to form minor determinants, which include benzylpenicilloate and benzylpenilloate. For an immediate reaction to penicillin or another b-lactam antibiotic, an IgE antibody to the common b-lactam ring as well as to a possible side chain must be assessed. A drug challenge test is the criterion standard for evaluating an IgE-mediated allergyboth to penicillin and to other b-lactams. Skin ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT OCTOBER 2020S18 BROYLES ET ALvitro testing have developed to identify a sensitization to a major/minor determinant and/or side chain and decrease the risk for a positive drug challenge test result. Penicillin skin testing. For patients with a history concern- ing for an IgE-mediated reaction to penicillin, or whose pasthistory is unclear, American and European guidelines recommendskin testing with both major penicillin 13,15,23In the United States, penicillin G is the only commercially available minor determinant, and it is used incombination with PPL (PRE-PEN; AllerQuest LLC, WestHartford, Conn), whereas and sodium benzylpenilloate (DAP; Diater, Madrid, Spain)are available as major and minor determinant, respectively. 8 It has been estimated that skin testing with PPL and penicillin G, without the use of penilloate and penicilloate, may miss 10% to 20% of penicillin-sensitized subjects.8,9,24-30The clinical utility of penilloate and penicilloate is controversial because studies from North America have found a comparable negative predictive value (>95%) between skin testing to PPL and penicillin G only versus PPL and minor determinant mixture reagent in patients challenged to penicillin. Skin testing with penicillin G alone without the use of PPL is not recommended, because up to 70% of patients who have a positive skin test result react only to PPL, and these patients canstill have a severe reaction. 24 Furthermore, the patient populations who have undergone skin testing with PPL and penicillin G alone are not comparableto the ones who had all the reagents used for testing. Hence, it isnot possible to compare the negative predictive value. In addi- tion, recent or severe historical reactors are not typically included when only PPL and penicillin G are used for skin testing. Epicutaneous and intradermal skin testing to PPL is performed using the commercially available undiluted concentration of 6 /C2 10 /C05mol/L. A nal epicutaneous and intradermal concentration used for penicillin G ranges between 5,940 and 10,000 U/mL and between 0.01 and 0.02 M for the other minor determinants (pen- icilloate and penilloate).8,13It is recommended that dilutions use saline, rather than sterile wate r, to lessen the possibility offalse-positive reactions. A 1:10 or 1:100 dilution of PPL and minordeterminants may be used selectively in patients who have experi-enced extremely severe reactions. In most guidelines, a positive result is a wheal having its greatest diame t e ra tl e a s t3m ml a r g e rt h a nt h a t seen with negative control, though some authors suggest a 5-mm wheal for increased sensitivity, especially for PPL, for which a 5-mmwheal for prick puncture testing is recommended in the package insert. 8,13-15, 31Concentrations for penicillin skin testing are pre- sented in Table I . Pediatric patients and pregnant women who have experienced immediate reactions should be evaluated using the diagnostic pro- tocol discussed earlier. Several studies have con rmed the safety of skin tests in children, with a rate of 1% to 3% of patients experiencing systemic reactions to skin testing.32-34The negative predictive value of an allergy evaluation that includes skin tests and drug challenge tests has been shown to be higher than 97% in children.34,35 Skin testing was also found to be safe in 56 pregnant women with group B Streptococcus colonization, with only 2 (4%) women experiencing a mild reaction during skin testing.36An oral chal- lenge was not performed at the time of the skin testing, but of the skin test enegative women, 47 (89%) went on to receive a full therapeutic dose of a penicillin-class antibiotic during the peri- partum period with no systemic reactions observed. In vitro tests. Serum-speci c IgE assays offer the most common in vitro method for evaluating immediate reactions to penicillins in both Europe and the United States. The most widely used commercial method is the fluoroimmunoassay (ImmunoCAP; TABLE I. Concentrations for penicillin Penicilloyl-polylysine M, mole. *Optional, based on physician discretion. FIGURE 1.

The low sensitivity (0%-50%) has limited its use in the United States and seems to correlate with the severity of the reac-tion. 37-40 Basophil activation test (BAT) has also been evaluated as a diagnostic tool for immediate hypersensitivity reactions topenicillin and other b-lactams. Its sensitivity is approximately 50%, with a speci city of more than 90%.39,41This test has not been validated, is not commercially available, and is not rec-ommended for clinical use at this time. Drug challenge tests. The negative predictive value for penicillin skin testing has been shown to be greater than 95% inNorth American studies. A small subpopulation of patients re-mains at risk for a potentially severe hypersensitivity reaction when rechallenged to penicillin. 8,28 Drug challenge is the diagnostic criterion standard for the exclusion of an immediate reaction and is recommended afterallergy evaluation when the patient is deemed unlikely to be allergic to the given drug. After negative penicillin skin test result, amoxicillin is typically administered as a drug challenge often as a single full dose and oc-casionally as 1/10th of the nal dose and then the nal dose. Amoxicillin is the penicillin most commonly used for drug challengesbecause it has both immunologically signi cant core penicillin structures and potentially signi cant R-group side chains. 42Chal- lenge with the drug that caused the reaction, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, may also be considered. Retesting.

A recent retrospective study of32 patients indicated that in patients who report penicillin allergy andhave negative penicillin skin testing result, repeated administration of intravenous penicillin antibiotics appears safe. 47 Nonimmediate reactions. Both delayed reading of intra- dermal tests (IDTs) and patch tests have been described as diagnostic tools for nonimmediate reactions. These tests have not yet been standardized or validated. In the United States, patch testing and delayed reading of IDTs are not yet routinely per-formed, but they are included in European guidelines. 15 Delayed-reading IDTs. IDT is performed using penicillin G as well as any other suspect penicillins or b-lactams. Delayed skin testing with PPL and other minor determinants has beenfound to have limited diagnostic value. 48 Penicillin G is administered at a concentration of 10,000 U/mL, whereas a concentration of 1 to 20 mg/mL can be used for othersuspect penicillins 48The clinician epicutaneous prick testing. If results are negativeafter 15 to 20 minutes have elapsed, one should proceed next toIDT. Again, results are read after 20 minutes to assess any immediateresponses. Additional readings of delayed reaction to skin tests areperformed after 48 and 72 hours. Any in ltrated erythema with a diameter larger than 5 mm is considered to be a positive reaction. Patch test. A patch test for penicillin and other suspect penicillins/ b-lactams is performed using a concentration of 5% to 10% penicillin in petrolatum. The patch should be worn for48 hours, with readings 15 minutes after removal of the stripsand again 24 hours later. The speci city for both delayed reading of IDTs and patch testing is high (90%-100%), but the sensitivity is less than 50% to60%. 20,49Delayed-reading IDTs appear to be more sensitive than patch testing but may also be less speci c.50,51Repeat exposure to the drug is often avoided, but there is limited data on the utility ofusing these 2 procedures to assist in the evaluation of non eIgE- mediated drug reactions. 49,52,53A recent consensus document indicated that patch testing and delayed intradermal readings couldbe of use for the diagnosis of maculopapular rashes, AGEP, andDRESS. Although patch testing may be considered in SJS and TEN, delayed reading of IDT is contraindicated in these 2 con- ditions. 54A multicenter study evaluated 134 patients with severe cutaneous reactions to drugs: 72 with DRESS, 45 with AGEP, and 17 with SJS TEN.52Patch tests were rst performed with drugs diluted to 1%, and if the results were negative, they were repeated with the drug diluted to 30% in petrolatum. Seventy-six partici-pants (56.7%) had positive patch-test results: 46 (64%) of the 72 with DRESS (of the antibiotics, 8 were positive to amoxicillin, 1 to dicloxacillin, 2 to ceftriaxone, and 1 to imipenem), 26 (58%) of the45 with AGEP (7 were positive to amoxicillin and 1 to ceftriaxone), and 4 (24%) of the 17 with SJS TEN (1 was sensitive to amoxi- cillin). In patients with negative patch-test results, 4 of 11 patients with AGEP and 3 of 4 patients with DRESS associated with b- lactams were positive on delayed-reading IDTs. Drug challenge test. A drug challenge test may be consid- ered for some nonimmediate reactions. Multiple protocols have been published for such drug challenge tests.14,15A full thera- peutic dose can be administered on the rst day or can be given incrementally over days to weeks. Some studies suggest that an additional treatment course for 7 to 10 days after the full ther- apeutic dose is needed to suf ciently exclude a nonimmediate reaction.55,56A potential caveat of this approach lies in exposing patients with a history of benign reactions to an unnecessarytherapeutic course of penicillin. Other penicillins Aminopenicillins. Amoxicillin and ampicillin are 2 of the most commonly prescribed aminopenicillins. Immediate reactions are IgE-mediated to either the common b-lactam structure or the R- group side chain.57Patients who are suspected or found to have a sensitization to amoxicillin or ampicillin should avoid drugs withsimilar or identical R-group side chains (until a formal allergyevaluation can be performed). These drugs include cefadroxil, cef- prozil, and cefatrizine (identical side chain shared with amoxicillin and similar for ampicillin) as well as cephalexin, cefaclor, cephradine,cephaloglycin, and loracarbef (similar amoxicillin ampicillin). 13,14The avoidance of cephalosporins with identical/ similar side chains does not hold true if the patient has already tolerated 1 of them, even if he or she is still avoiding penicillins. Studies have suggested that amoxicillin sensitivity is more prevalent among European patients, with up to 50% of patientswith a history of penicillin allergy determined to be sensitized ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL to 6% in North Amer- ica.8,26,58As a result, European guidelines recommend that amoxicillin skin testing be performed concurrently with peni- cillin for all patients, whereas testing for amoxicillin is not consistently performed in North America.14,15 Unlike skin testing for penicillin, skin testing for amoxicillin and ampicillin is not validated, and the predictive value is unknown. Adrug challenge test is required to assess for an immediate reaction.Skin testing can be performed using nonirritating concentrations that can potentially help identify sensitized individuals. Nonirritating concentrations of amoxicillin range from 3 to 25 mg/mL. Similar topenicillin-speci c IgE, amoxicillin-speci c IgE diminishes over time. One study found that all 24 patients who were found to be skin testpositive after exposure to the drug were skin test negative after 5years. 10Because the parenteral form of amoxicillin is not available in the United States, equivalent concentrations for skin testing cannot be reliably achieved. For ampicillin, skin testing is performed using a concentration of 2.5 to 25 mg/mL. Recently, the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) is evaluating a Penicillin Kit that will contain amoxicillin. 30 If skin testing result is negative, a drug challenge test is rec- ommended. If either skin testing result or the oral challenge ispositive, then avoidance or desensitization is recommended. openem, ertapenem) share a common b-lactam ring, giving rise to concern for possible cross-reactivity (Figure 1 ). Studies over the last decade, performed either on adults or on children, have demon- strated an absence or very low (1%) rate of cross-reactivity betweenpenicillins and carbapenems. 59-65Nonirritating concentrations for skin testing to common carbapenems are listed in Table II . For patients with a history of an immediate reaction and negative skin testing result to penicillin, carbapenem should prove safe. If penicillin skin testing is not available or cannot be performed, then a carbapenem drug challenge test is recommended. For a positivepenicillin skin test result, carbapenem can be administered as a 2- step graded challenge. 61If skin testing result is negative, it is reasonable to administer a single full-dose challenge.61 Monobactams. Monobactams consist of a monocyclic b-lactam ring structure with no adjoining rings ( Figure 1 ).Currently, the only commercially available monobactam isaztreonam. Studies have demonstrated a lack of cross-reactivity between penicillin and aztreonam. 61,66,67A lack of cross-reac- tivity has also been demonstrated between cephalosporins and aztreonam, with the exception of ceftazidime, which shares an identical side chain.66Skin testing is performed with a nonirri- tating concentration of 2 mg/mL. Aztreonam may be given to patients with a history of penicillin allergy. Clavulanate. Clavulanate is a b-lactam inhibitor and is frequently combined with a penicillin such as amoxicillin. Although uncommon, clavulanate has been reported as a caus- ative agent for immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Skin testing with an epicutaneous concentration of clavulanate at 10 mg/mLand intradermal concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mg/mL was found to be nonirritating in 1 small case series. 68Skin testing with intravenous solutions of amoxicillin-clavulate has also been re- ported.69Given the limited availability of isolated clavulanate/ clavulanic acid and intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in theUnited States, a drug challenge to amoxicillin/clavulanic is rec-ommended if clavulanate is suspected and the initial drug chal-lenge to amoxicillin is negative. Management High-risk patients. Individuals with a demonstrated sensi- tivity to penicillin, either on positive skin testing or on failed drug challenge tests, should avoid the responsible drug as well as those that are potentially cross-reactive. It is reasonable to repeat skin testing if many years have passed since previous skin testing.If there are no reasonable alternatives, both oral and intravenousdesensitization protocols have been well established in American and European guidelines. 13,15Examples of these are provided in Tables III andIV, respectively.70,71 Low-risk patients. For patients who are at low risk of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, including those with a his- tory of itching without urticaria, mild maculopapular rash (ie,less than 1-week duration), or other benign rash, a drug challenge test may be considered without the use of skin testing. 72Tools, such as a recently published clinical pathway for patients with penicillin allergy, can help guide physicians in deciding whetherTABLE II.

Cephalosporin adverse drug reactions (ADRs) affect about 0.5% to 2.5% of patients. ADRs include nephropathy and acquisition of C dif cilecolitis.74Although cephalosporin allergy is approximately 10-fold less common than penicillin allergy, itremains one of the most commonly reported drug allergies in theUnited States. 75 Major symptoms. Cephalosporins can elicit various hyper- sensitivity reactions, including cause serum sickness elike reactions. 13They may also less frequently lead to severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) and isolated eosinophilia.74,76 Diagnosis Immediate hypersensitivity skin testing. Most hyper- sensitivity reactions to cephalosporins are directed at the R-group side chain ( Figure 2 ) rather than the core b-lactam ring mole- cule.77,78However, it may be useful to also perform penicillin skin testing when patients present with possible sensitivity to cephalosporins, particularly those in the earlier generations, which include the aminocephalosporins (cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefadroxil; Table V ). Although skin testing to native ceph- alosporins is not standardized, a positive skin test result with a nonirritating concentration suggests the presence of drug-speci c IgE antibodies.79,80A negative skin test result does not rule out an allergy, and must be followed by an observed graded challenge(Table VI ). Similar to data suggestive of loss of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to penicillins, patients with IgE-mediated allergy to cephalosporins may lose sensitivity over time. 81Delayed hypersensitivity skin testing. For SCARs, us- ing the RegiSCAR scoring method for diagnosis is recommended, and skin biopsy is usually indicated.82Patch testing may be useful, especially for DRESS syndrome and AGEP.77Patch tests to cephalosporins may be performed using a 30% dilution of the drug in petrolatum (not commercially available in the United States), with readings at 48 and 72 hours.52 Management General/clinical pathways. For patients with true or re- ported cephalosporin allergy, management can be challenging, especially for nonallergist providers. A clinical pathway that in-corporates both cephalosporin generation (because of b-lactam ring relevance by generation) and cephalosporin side chain(because of cross-reactivity by side chain/R group) can help directsafe use of b-lactam in the setting of previously reported hy- persensitivity, though outcome data are limited (Figure 3 ,A).73 Similar pathways have been implemented for demonstration ofcephalosporin tolerance in patients with historical penicillin al-lergies ( Figure 3 ,B). 73To date, data on these clinical pathways conrm that they increase b-lactam use in acute therapeutic situations and increase rst-line antibiotic treatment in an appropriately risk-adverse manner (reactions were observed in 0.5%-4.0% of patients).73,83 Oral challenge. An oral challenge to cephalosporin would be appropriate if the reaction appeared to be (1) unlikely to have been caused by the cephalosporin, (2) not immune-mediated/serious/ life-threatening, or (3) in response to a different cephalosporin with low to medium risk of cross-reactivity (eg, cephalosporins withdissimilar side chain, history of IgE-mediated penicillin allergy). As with any other drug challenge, the potential risks, bene ts, and alternatives should be discussed with the patient and/or the pa- tient's parents/guardians and informed consent should be ob- tained. The procedure should be performed in a monitored clinicalsetting where emergency support is readily available. Generally,drug challenges to dissimilar cephalosporins are safe to perform.TABLE IV.

In cases of serum sickness elike reaction to cefaclor or cefprozil, it is appropriate to use another cephalosporin, preferably one with dissimilar R1 side chains. A standard 2-step test dose protocol is as safe as longer protocols, but less likely to induce tolerance (Table IV ). 83,84Desensitization. The most common desensitization protocol for cephalosporins comprises 12 steps and it is intended for IgE-mediated reactions ( Table IV ). 13Contraindications to desensi- tization include severe T-cell emediated reactions such as DRESS, TEN, or SJS. Although initiating treatment with stan-dard desensitization protocol is recommended, its duration may be modi ed in such a manner that it takes into account a pa- tient's relevant history and considers both comorbidities and acuity of the present illness.

Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMZ-TMP) is a common cause of hypersensitivity and ADRs. Before 1982, SMZ-TMP was the second most common medication behind amoxicillin to result in cutaneous ADRs in the hospital.85These reactions are primarily due to hypersensitivity to the sulfonamide component, and speci c hypersensitivity to trimethoprim is rare and has been reported anecdotally.86Patients with HIV have been reported to have a rate of sensitivity to SMZ-TMP that ranges from 34% to 50%87,88; however, the frequency of cutaneous ADRs exceeds that of those that occur in response to aminopenicillins.89 Most ADRs to SMZ-TMP are hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) such as SJS, TEN, and DRESS, and hepatic, renal, andhematologic reactions have also been described. 13 Diagnosis. Validated diagnostic testing is not currently avail- able for SMZ-TMP hypersensitivity.90However, if an IgE-medi- ated ADR to SMZ-TMP is suspected, skin testing using anonirritating concentration of 1:100 dilution of 80 mg/mL, or 0.8mg/mL, may be considered. 80A positive result could suggest IgE- mediated sensitization, and a negative result would not rule out an IgE-mediated reaction to SMZ-TMP. Oral challenge, either as a single full dose or as 1/10th of the dose followed by the full dose,may be considered on the basis of clinical history and skin test results. 91Dapsone may be tolerated in patients with histories of sulfonamide reactions; however, there is con flicting information on cross-reactivity, and avoidance of dapsone is recommended inpatients with histories of severe reactions to sulfonamides. 92 Management. Desensitization is an important component in the management of SMZ-TMP hypersensitivity. The term desensitization has traditionally been used for IgE-mediated sensi- tivity. It has also been applied to treatments for reactions to SMZ-TMP, even when the mechanisms underlying the reaction are unclear. The Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters has recom- mended that the term \"temporary induction of tolerance \" 13is more appropriate than desensitization in these circumstances. In the event of severe DHRs (SJS, TEN, DRESS, and others) to SMZ-TMP, the drug should be avoided. If no alternativesexist and the bene ts of treatment with SMZ-TMP outweigh the risk of death from a severe hypersensitivity reaction, 13a previ- ously reported temporary induction of tolerance protocol thatwas successfully used for 2 patients may be considered. 93 Most literature on the temporary induction of tolerance to SMZ-TMP focuses on the HIV patient population. The variousprotocols for temporary induction of tolerance to SMZ-TMPhave shown similar success rates (initial 80%-90%; long- term: 60%-80%) ( Table VII ). 89,94-104There is no current consensus on the best protocol for SMZ-TMP temporary in- duction of tolerance. Interestingly, when patients with a history of mild to moderate SMZ-TMP hypersensitivity were random- ized to temporary induction of tolerance or full-dose challenge,they showed similar success rates in tolerating the drug(Table VIII). Some studies found full-dose challenge success rates to range from 58% to 72% and those of temporary induction of tolerance to range from 60% to 80%. 94,97,102Leoung et al98 reported a 75% success rate in the temporary induction of tolerance group compared with 58% in the full-dose challenge group (58%) ( P\u00bc.014). Therefore, a full-dose challenge could be considered for patients with mild reactions to SMZ-TMP as an alternative to an induction of tolerance procedure. Very few studies have examined the temporary induction of tolerance to SMZ-TMP in non-HIV patient populations.99,105 Mann et al99described 4 patients with a history of SMZ-TMP hypersensitivity (leukopenia, hives, macular rash, morbilliformrash) who underwent a successful temporary induction of toler-ance using either an 8-day protocol or a 22-day protocol. 106,107 Pyle et al108reported that 90% of 72 patients with a history of SMZ-TMP hypersensitivity who required the drug and under-went temporary induction of tolerance had successful outcomeswith the 6-step, 14-step, or more than 1-day protocols. The data suggest that SMZ-TMP temporary induction of tolerance may be considered in non-HIV patients with a history of relatedhypersensitivity. The procedure appears to result in success rates comparable to those seen in patients with HIV. In summary, temporary induction of tolerance to SMZ-TMP can be used safely and effectively in patients with and without HIV who have SMZ-TMP hypersensitivity. For HIV-positive patients with a history of a mild SMZ-TMP hypersensitivity, a full-dose challenge can be considered; however, this option mayresult in higher rates of ADRs than those associated with the temporary induction of tolerance. A standardized temporary in- duction of tolerance protocol for SMZ-TMP is not currentlyavailable, and a range of temporary induction of tolerance pro- tocols may be appropriate for use with HIV-positive patients (Table VII ).Tables IX, X, and XIpresent protocols described by Pyle et al, 108which offer options for temporary induction of tolerance to SMZ-TMP for non-HIV patients. Quinolones (by Maria Jose Torres, MD) Introduction. The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions to quinolones, especially anaphylactic reactions, is increasing, likely related to the increase in their use. They can induce IgE- and T-celledependent reactions, with the IgE type being the most common, and moxi floxacin as an increasing inductor of re- actions.109-112Factors in fluencing the increase in moxi floxacin IgE hypersensitivity in countries where it is prescribed are not known.109- 111A mast cell especi c receptor has been identi ed (MRGPRX2), which is a target for direct activation by quinolones and some other drugs with tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) motifs.113A previous diagnosis of immediate hypersensitivity to b-lactams can be a risk factor for developing IgE reactions to quinolones.110Cipro floxacin is the main quinolone involved in delayed reactions.112 Clinical symptoms. The most frequent clinical symptoms are immediate urticaria and anaphylaxis, with some reports indicating that they can be severe.109-112Delayed reactions usually reported are maculopapular exanthem, delayed urticaria, andxed drug eruptions. Although less frequent, other reactions such as AGEP, SJS, and TEN have also been described. Diagnosis. Various factors can complicate the diagnosis of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to quinolones. First, the clinical history is often unreliable, because nearly 70% of patientswith a clinical history of quinolone hypersensitivity challenge73,84 Step 11/4of an oral dose/pill/1/10th of parenteral or oral liquid dose, observe for 30-60 min Step 2 1 full dose, observe for 60 minJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT OCTOBER 2020S24 BROYLES ET ALcan tolerate the drug and are therefore not allergic.110,112Second, skin testing has resulted in a high number of false-positive results, likely due to the capacity of some quinolones to induce direct histamine release.109,110,112,114Table XII summarizes quinolone concentrations most frequently recommended in the current literature.112,114,115Therefore, drug challenge is the most useful diagnostic assay, and procedure-related anaphylaxis is rare inproperly selected patients. Table XIII presents the recommended procedures for drug challenge tests. Recently, in vitro approaches, such as radioimmunoassay and BAT, have proved useful tools for diagnosis, though their sensitivity is not optimal and they are not commercially available. 109,110,114 The diagnosis of delayed reaction is also dif cult, and particularly relevant is the lack of reliability of the clinical history,where fewer than 5% of cases evaluated are nally con rmed as allergic. 110,112Patch testing has shown high speci city but low sensitivity. In cases with maculopapular exanthems or delayedurticaria, the most frequent clinical symptoms, the diagnosis isusually con rmed with a drug challenge test.Management. Although there are no general rules for pre- dicting cross-reactivity, this seems to exist between rst- and second-generation quinolones, with lower levels seen with the third- and fourth-generation quinolones. Therefore, patients with immediate hypersensitivity to quinolones are recommendedto avoid the administration of the whole group, and speci c recommendations of tolerance need to be made on a patient-by-patient basis using a drug challenge test. For higher-risk patients,desensitization to quinolones may be considered ( Table XIV ). However, cross-reactivity in delayed reactions seems (by Miriam Verdu Benhamu, MD, Anca Pascal Demoly, MD, PhD) General. Macrolide antibiotics are considered to be some of the safest antibiotic treatments available.

Macrolide antibiotics usually have a bacteriostatic effect by inhibiting the mRNA-direct protein synthesis after binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit; they are broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical pathogens. Theirclinical uses include upper and lower respiratory tract infections,skin infections, sexually transmitted diseases, and the eradication regimen of Helicobacter pylori . Their pharmacokinetic properties include low to moderate oral bioavailability and extensive diffusion into tissues and fluids due to their lipophilic nature. The 14-membered ring macrolides have an af cyto- chrome p450 (CYP450); therefore, potential drug interactionsmust be taken into account when other drugs metabolized by CYP450 enzymes (such as phenytoin, cyclosporine, theophyl- line, and carbamazepine) are coprescribed. Major symptoms. Published hypersensitivity reactions to macrolides include both immediate (< 1 hour after drug intake) and nonimmediate (delayed) reactions.116-120Urticaria and/or angioedema are the most commonly described symptoms, butmaculopapular exanthems (some severe, evocative of DRESS),xed drug eruptions, and bullous skin reactions are also seen. Anaphylaxis caused by macrolides has also rarely been described. In addition to hypersensitivity reactions, macrolides can induce gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps, because they stimulate gut contractility. 116 Macrolides can also cause sensorineural ototoxicity, which is usually transient, as well as prolongation of the QT interval.116Diagnosis. When hypersensitivity to macrolides is suspected, the most common approach adopted by physicians is avoidance especially because these agents are rarely indicated as rst-line treatment.116,121However, clinical history alone is insuf cient to ascertain the diagnosis, and published series reveal that, afterperforming a drug challenge test, hypersensitivity to macrolides is conrmed in only 2.7% to 17% of cases. 118,120Therefore, in some situations, including the prevention/treatment of Toxo- plasma gondii , eradication of and treatment of some atypical Mycobacteria , testing should be performed. A detailed clinical history including the macrolide involved, the chronology, and type of reaction, as well as the treatment used, is always needed. Skin tests (prick and sequenced IDT for immediate reactions with the few available injectable forms and delayed-reading IDTs andpatch tests for nonimmediate reactions) can be helpful in the diag- nostic evaluation. They are not fully validated, because it is necessaryto perform them in a large number of patients with proper controls, and therefore, real predictive values are unknown.

Mori et al122performed an allergy workup in children with histories of suspected clarithromycin and azi- thromycin hypersensitivity. Skin tests were performed to these drugs on both subjects and negative controls. The highest nonirritatingconcentrations used for the prick and intradermal tests were 50 mg/ mL and 0.5 mg/mL, respectively, for clarithromycin and 100 mg/ mL and 0.01 mg/mL, respectively, for azithromycin. There areconcerns about false-positive and false-negative reactions associated with macrolide skin testing; therefore, graded challenge remains the criterion standard. Furthermore, clarithromycin is not available inintravenous form in the United States. In vitro tests, such as BATs and lymphocyte transformation tests, and detection of macrolide-speci c IgE antibodies have been used in several case reports, but they are yet to be stan-dardized and are not commercially available. Drug challenge tests remain the criterion standard to establish or exclude macrolide hypersensitivity. 16,118,123Drug challenge can be performed for the suspected drug, a structurally related one, or an alternative substance; however, the challenge must always be carried out under strict medical surveillance and after a consciousassessment of a risk-bene t analysis on a per-patient basis. It is best performed as single-blinded, with increasing doses given every 30minutes to achieve the maximum daily dose. Mori et al 122used a 3-dose protocol, that is, 10%-20%-70% of the daily therapeuticdose on day 1, followed by a full-dose administration on day 2. In patients with a history of nonimmediate reactions, the challenge was continued for 5 days at a therapeutic dose. Other macrolides. Nonantibiotic macrolides have also been involved in drug hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from allergiccontact dermatitis (ACD) due to topical application of tacroli-mus in patients with atopic dermatitis, to generalized reactionselicited by systemic administration. Saito et al 124performed a literature review on oral tacrolimus erelated drug hypersensitivity reactions. Considering its immunosuppressive effects, it is notsurprising that most patch-test results (but not all) were negative and most of these cases were diagnosed with a lymphocyte stimulation test. 124,125Severe reactions, namely, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or DRESS, have been attributed drug Cross-reactivity among different macrolides has not been extensively studied, but when it was tested, most patientswith a demonstrated hypersensitivity to a certain macrolide could tolerate another with a different number of atoms in the lactone ring. 80,116Mori et al122reported double positivity in 2 patients with clinical histories of anaphylaxis to clarithromycin (14-C) and azithromycin (15-C). One of them had experienced anaphylaxis to both drugs, whereas the other one had never taken clarithromycin. Macrolide antibiotics are unlikely to cross-react as published case, cross-reactivity was suspected between clarithromycin and tacrolimus, but for both drugs, theassumption of drug hypersensitivity was based on clinical history alone and no speci c workup was performed. 128 Very few case reports of desensitization protocols to macro- lides have been published (eg, to spiramycin in a pregnantwoman suffering from toxoplasmosis or to clarithromycin in 2 patients infected by our knowl- edge, there are no reports to date for other commonly prescribed macrolides, such as azithromycin and/or erythromycin.

For all tetracyclines, most hypersensitivity reactions are non eIgE-mediated, and include DRESS, serum sickness elike and photo- reactions do occur, and anaphylaxis has been reported.137-139One report of drug fever secondary to tigecycline use has also been published.140Rates of cross-reactivity between tetracycline antibiotics are not established; however, 1 report includes a patient with doxycycline hypersen- sitivity who did exhibit cross-sensitization with minocycline.141 Diagnosis. For patients with suspected IgE-mediated reactions, skin testing is not standardized for any of the tetracycline antimi-crobials, and positive and negative predictive values have not been established. One case report has noted positive skin prick testing result to full-strength tetracycline. 138In addition, the minimum nonirritating concentration for intradermal in control sub- jects mg/mL and 0.001 skin testing protocols recommended: for mg/mL, intradermal testing 0.001 with low clinical suspicion for anaphylactic reactions and negative skin testing result, a graded drugchallenge may be considered. 13In cases of high suspicion for anaphylaxis or positive skin testing result where a tetracycline anti- biotic is required, desensitization can be performed. There are no published reports of effective rapid desensitization protocols forthese drugs, but some success has been seen with oral desensitizationto minocycline and doxycycline. A 14-step protocol was used for minocycline, starting at 0.01 mg, followed by dose doubling at 30- minute intervals until the cumulative goal was reached. Further-more, an oral desensitization protocol for doxycycline ( Table XVIII ) was successful, starting at 0.00001 mg and increasing in 10-foldsteps every 30 minutes until 1 mg was reached, and then increasingby 2-fold increments until the goal dose was reached. 142 Successful desensitization to tigecycline using a 12-step pro- tocol has also been recently reported.142 Vancomycin (by Johnson Wong, MD) General.

Anaphylactoid reactions/ana phylaxis/severe refractory RMS. This may occur in a small subgroup of patients. Although an IgE-mediated mechanism is possible, most of these cases appeared to beas e v e r ef o r mo fD M C D .V a n c o m y c i n - s p e c i c IgE measurement has not been reported in the literature . Skin testing has been proposed as a surrogate for both DMCD sensitiv ity and possible IgE-mediated sensitivity (see Skin Testing section below). 144-146This highly sensitive group can generally receive a rapid continuous intravenous protocol as a method to induce temporary drug tolerance as described for vanco- m y c i na sw e l la so t h e rd r u g s .147-150Its advantage lies in the provision of continuous small increments that avoid periodic substantial increases in the rate of drug delivery. In several cases, one can reach a threshold level only the rst day and the dose need to be gradually increased over several days. When possible, stopping concurrent narcotics or otheragents that also have DMCD property may often allow a dif cult desensitization to be successful. Morbilliform rash/hematologic changes/DRESS. Morbilliform rash is relatively common and often occurs inisolation. It may also be accompanied by various combinations of fever, hematologic changes, and/or end-organ dysfunction. The hematologic changes commonly include lymphocytosis, throm- bocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and vasculitis. The end organs that may be affected include kidney and liver. The combination ofdrug reaction, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms constitutes the DRESS reaction, and a recent report indicated that HLA:A*32:01 is strongly associated with vancomycin-induced DRESS. 147 Another study suggested that circulating IFN- gvancomycin- specic T cells may be isolated in such patients.151For patients who are receiving multiple drugs and develop these reactions,vancomycin should join b-lactam antibiotics high in the differ- ential.152For patients with renal failure, vancomycin should be considered as a culprit agent, because of its long half-life, even if thereaction occurs weeks after the last dose. Management consists ofdrug withdrawal and supportive treatment. Linear IgA bullous diseases/TEN. Vancomycin is the most commonly reported cause of the rare linear IgA bullousdiseases that may present as TEN-like reactions. 153In addition, TEN without identifying the mechanism has been reported.Management is drug withdrawal and supportive treatment.These reactions serve as absolute contraindication for re-administration or desensitization. Teicoplanin as alternative treatment. Teicoplanin is a similar glycopeptide antibiotic that is available only outside the United States. A major retrospective study and a prospective study from the same institution over different time framesshowed that 12 of 117 (10%) and 14 of 24 (58%) patients, respectively, who had a hypersensitivity reaction to vancomycin also developed one to teicoplanin. 154,155There was a high recurrence rate and new occurrence rate for neutropenia,leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (10 of 14). Therefore, tei- coplanin may not be an ideal alternative treatment option for patients with vancomycin hypersensitivity. Skin testing and implications. Skin testing has been proposed as a surrogate for both DMCD sensitivity and possibleIgE-mediated sensitivity. Polk et al 146performed titration of vancomycin skin test reactivity as a function of vancomycinconcentration in a group of 12 healthy male volunteers. Atconcentrations of more than or equal to 10 mg/mL (0.02 mL intradermally), all volunteers showed detectable wheal and flare. The area of the flare, but not the wheal size, increased with higher concentration, up to 40 to 100 mg/mL (0.02 mL intra- dermally) before reaching a plateau. Because these were healthy volunteers without previous vancomycin exposure, the wheal- and-flare responses were assumed to be due to DMCD at doses of more than or equal to 10 mg/mL (0.02 mL intradermally) and not an IgE-mediated mechanism. The size of the flare at 25 mg/ mL (0.02 mL intradermally) correlated poorly with the area offlushing when the subjects were challenged with vancomycin infusion.

Lowest dilution was based on 1:100 dilution of the concentration that lead to positive skin testing result. Serial dilutions of doxycycline suspension were prepared with PRACT OCTOBER IgE-mediated sensitivity.144,145However, the cutaneous reactivity, even at 0.1 mg/mL, may represent increased propensity for DMCD or increased sensitivity to the mast cell release products (induced byconcurrent narcotic or due to intrinsic sensitivity of the pa- tient). 150Overall, the general consensus is that 50 mg/mL for skin prick testing and 0.005 mg/mL for intradermal skin testing are nonirritating concentrations ). Aminoglycosides (by Catherine Biggs, Aminoglycosides are a broad-spectrum class of anti- biotics that are structurally composed of hydrophilic sugars possessing amine and hydroxyl functional groups.156Type IV hypersensitivity reactions in the form of ACD are commonlyassociated with aminoglycosides. The prevalence of ACD to neomycin sulfate reported by the North American Contact Dermatitis Group from 1985 to 2004 ranged from 7.2% to13.1%. 157Systemic contact dermatitis to aminoglycosides, as well as severe type IV hypersensitivity reactions such as TEN andDRESS syndrome, have also been described. 158-160IgE-mediated reactions to aminoglycosides are uncommon but may occur after exposure to topical, inhaled, and systemic preparations.161-163 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. IgE-mediated re- actions described in the literature include urticarial reactions in response to both intravenous and inhaled tobramycin, as well asanaphylaxis to topical and systemic aminoglycosides. 161-163ACD may present as erythematous/pruritic/edematous papules, pla-ques, and/or vesicles at the site of contact. 157TEN caused by streptomycin has been associated with high fever, vomiting, and diffuse erythema, followed by extensive bullae formation and skin denudation.159Features of DRESS syndrome include a maculopapular and edematous skin rash, facial edema, and fever; laboratory studies may demonstrate eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytosis, abnormal liver enzymes, and coagulopathy.158 Diagnosis. IgE-mediated reactions are diagnosed on the basis of clinical features in keeping with an immediate hypersensitivityreaction, and have been con rmed in the literature using skin testing. Systemic reactions to epicutaneous and intradermaltesting have been described in patients with a history ofanaphylaxis to topical and systemic aminoglycosides, respec- tively. 161,164,165Skin testing should therefore be approached with caution, and one may consider beginning with a 10-fold dilution for the rst intradermal dose in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to an aminoglycoside (Table XX). The diagnosis of type IV hypersensitivity reactions may be supported diagnostically by patch testing to the aminoglycoside in question. Signi cant cross-reactivity among aminoglycosides has been reported in ACD.157 Management. Avoidance of the offending agent is recom- mended for patients with a history of type IV hypersensitivity reactions. In the setting of negative skin testing result and low clinical suspicion for an IgE-mediated allergy, a graded challenge can be performed. Rapid desensitization is recommended forpatients with an IgE-mediated allergy to an aminoglycoside who require the medication when no suitable alternative antibiotic exists. 167Table XXI presents an example of a desensitization protocol for tobramycin.Clindamycin (by Jocelyn R. Farmer, MD) General. Clindamycin, a semisynthetic derivative of linco- mycin, is a bacteriostatic agent that inhibits protein synthesis. It has been on the market since 1968 and is generally well tolerated. Common adverse reactions include a metallic taste in the mouth,transient elevation of transaminases, and a propensity for C difcileinfection, with an increased risk for diarrhea (10%-23%) and pseudomembranous colitis (2%). 168 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Immediate hy- persensitivity to clindamycin is rare, though has been reported. 169-171Delayed hyper- sensitivity to clindamycin is much more common, initially esti- mated at 10% in small clinical studies from the 1970s, but revised to be less than 1% in a large retrospective chart review ofclindamycin administration at a single US center from 1995 to 1997. 172-174Delayed maculopapular exanthems are predomi- nantly seen; however, SJS, DRESS, TEN, sweet syndrome, and AGEP have all been reported in the literature.175-183TABLE XIX.

Theunderlying mechanism is unclear, though direct myelosup-pression at the level of the hematopoietic stem cell has been shown. 184 Diagnosis. Immediate hypersensitivity skin testing to clinda- mycin has been studied. Skin prick at 150 mg/mL and intra- dermal injection at 15 mg/mL have been identi ed as nonirritating concentrations.80,185However, skin testing for immediate hypersensitivity to clindamycin was shown to beinferior to direct drug challenge in a study of 31 patients with ahistory of adverse clindamycin reaction, where 0 of 31 patients demonstrated a positive skin test result but 10 of 31 patients (32%) reacted during an oral challenge with 150 mg clindamy-cin. 185The utility of immediate hypersensitivity skin testing to clindamycin in routine clinical practice has been questioned. Incontrast, delayed hypersensitivity patch testing to clindamycinhas been more promising. In patients with a predominant historyof delayed maculopapular exanthems, patch testing via clinda- mycin 150-mg tablet pulverized and diluted in 1 mL saline or via pure clindamycin diluted to 10% in petrolatum resulted inpositive reactions in 15% to 30% of patients, respectively. 186,187 Therefore, clindamycin patch testing may be useful in thecontext of a convincing history of delayed hypersensitivity. Management. Most adverse reactions to clindamycin are mild and the drug can be continued safely. In cases of severeDHRs to clindamycin (eg, SJS, DRESS, TEN, and AGEP), the drug should be empirically avoided and there are no suitable alternatives. For nonsevere DHRs to clindamycin (eg, isolatedmaculopapular exanthem), described. 188The DHR to clindamycin was con rmed on repeat oral challenge. The starting dose for the desensitizationwas clindamycin 20 mg every 8 hours, with dose escalation over7 days as given in Table XXII . The patient was without adverse reaction at the 13-month follow-up, demonstrating proof ofprinciple for clindamycin desensitization ofdelayed drug hypersensitivity. More recently, clindamycin desensitization in the treatment of immediate drug hypersensi- tivity was reported in the literature in a single pediatric case usinga rapid 9-step oral clindamycin desensitization protocol over 4 hours to a cumulative dose of 11 mg/kg per dose (300 mg/dose), which was then continued every 8 hours for the duration of theantimicrobial course. 189 Linezolid (by Jocelyn R. Farmer, MD) General. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone that works by inhibit- ing the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis. It was rst introduced for clinical use in the United States in 2000 and is generally well tolerated. Among the known adverse reactions,linezolid-induced cytopenias are best described and occur more frequently with long-term therapy (> 14 days), increased daily dose (/C2122 mg/kg), high serum concentration, and comorbidities including renal insuf ciency. 190-193Prevalence rates vary widely by study design but have been estimated at 15% to 50% for thrombocytopenia, 4.2% to 16% for anemia, and 2.2% to 4.5%for leukopenia. 194-196The underlying mechanism is felt to be myelosuppression secondary to off-target inhibition of hostprotein synthesis in the bone marrow, which aligns with thedose-dependent and reversible nature of linezolid-induced cyto- penias and the fact that linezolid-dependent antiplatelet anti- bodies have not been described. 197Less frequent adverse reactions to linezolid include lactic acidosis, which typically oc-curs with long-term therapy ( >6 weeks) and has been attributed to the underlying mitochondrial inhibitory mechanism of thedrug. 198In addition, there has been a case report of peripheral and optic neuropathy.199-201 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Immediate hy- persensitivity to linezolid is rare. In a review of 828 linezolidtreatment courses from 1997 to 2000, treatment-limitingdermatologic events including rash and pruritus occurred in 1.7% of cases, and only 2 patients had anaphylactic-type re- actions. 194Subsequently, a case of immediate urticaria and angioedema to linezolid and 2 more detailed descriptions of suspected linezolid anaphylaxis were reported in the litera- ture.202-204Delayed hypersensitivity to interstitial Full therapeutic mg IV q8h Tobramycin solutions 1. 1 mg/200 mL NS (nal concentration \u00bc0.005 mg/mL) 2. 10 mg/200 mL NS (nal concentration \u00bc0.050 mg/mL) 3. 99 mg/200 NS Step SolutionRate (mL/h)Time (min)Administered dose (mg)Cumulative dose (mg) 1 1 2.5 15 0.0031 0.0031 2 1 5 15 0.0063 0.0094 3 1 10 15 0.0125 0.0219 4 1 20 15 0.0250 0.0469 5 2 5 15 0.0625 0.1094 6 2 10 15 0.1250 0.2344 7 2 20 15 0.2500 0.4844 8 2 40 15 0.5000 0.9844 9 3 10 15 1.2377 2.2221 10 3 20 15 2.4754 4.6975 11 3 15 4.9508 9.6482 12 90.3518 100.0000 normal saline; q8h, every 8 h. *Dosage will vary on the basis of indication and patient weight.

Diagnosis. To date, no standardized immediate or delayed hypersensitivity skin testing protocols for linezolid have beenpublished. Diagnosis is therefore limited to direct oral or intra- venous challenge in cases in which it is clinically safe to do so. Management. Treatment-limiting adverse reactions to line- zolid include gastrointestinal complaints (with oral preparations), cytopenias, rash, and angioedema.194,195In cases of severe DHRs to linezolid (eg, acute interstitial nephritis or DRESS), the drug should be empirically avoided. Alternatively, for immediate hy- persensitivity reactions, linezolid desensitization has been described.202,203Given that the drug has an oral bioavailability of approximately 100% in healthy volunteers, the rst protocol used oral desensitization to linezolid. The patient tolerated 14sequential dilutions in of symp-toms. 203More recently, intravenous linezolid desensitization as presented inTable XXIII . The patient had no breakthrough symptoms and subsequently made a transition to oral linezolid 600 mg every 12hours to complete a 2-week course. Nitrofurantoin (by Jocelyn R. Farmer, MD) General. Nitrofurantoin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that wasrst approved as clinical treatment for urinary tract infections in 1953. Intracellular nitroreductase produces the active drug metabolite, which functions to inhibit bacterial DNA and RNA synthesis.209Adverse reactions to nitrofurantoin are infrequent (5%-16%) and generally mild, reversible, and predominantly gastrointestinal (nausea and abdominal discomfort).210 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Immediate hy- persensitivity reactions to nitrofurantoin are rare. Nitrofurantoin- induced anaphylaxis has been reported, and acute pulmonary reactions with symptoms consisting of shortness of breath, cough, fever, and peripheral eosinophilia within days to weeks ofdrug initiation have been reported at a rate of 1 in 5000 rst administrations. 211-214Lung pathology can demonstrate vascu- litis, mild interstitial in flammation, eosinophils, and pneumocytes.215In general, with drug discontinuation, pa- tients have prompt recovery, and nitrofurantoin-induced acutepulmonary reactions have an overall mortality rate of only0.5%. reactions are rare, with incidence rates per nitrofurantoin course previously calculated at 0.001% for all pulmonary reactions combined, 0.0003% for hepatotoxicity, with systemic autoantibody production and lymphocytic in ltrates to the end organ with subsequent risk for brosis.215,218An un- derlying mechanism of direct drug injury (via reactive oxygenspecies) and indirect drug injury (via induced cellular hyper-sensitivity) has been described. 219,220In general, patients havepronounced recovery with drug cessation, though occasionallysteroid therapy is also required. 215,218 Diagnosis. To date, no standardized immediate or delayed hypersensitivity skin testing protocols for nitrofurantoin havebeen published despite a few case reports. 214,221Diagnosis is therefore limited to direct oral challenge in cases in which it is clinically safe to do so. Management. Most adverse reactions (eg, nausea and abdominal discomfort) are mild and the drug can be continued safely. However, in rare cases of severe nitrofurantoin-inducedimmediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis and acute pulmonary reactions), or DHRs (eg, pulmonary brosis and hepatitis), nitrofurantoin should be discontinued immediately and empirically avoided. Case reports of drug desensitization have not been described. Antituberculous drugs (by Stephanie Logsdon, MD, and Josefina Cernadas, MD) Introduction. Tuberculosis (TB), an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a curable infectious disease, prev- alent worldwide, and potentially fatal if proper treatment is not instituted. It remains a major cause of global mortality and morbidity. Most of the 2 billion people estimated to be infected with M tuberculosis have asymptomatic infection, termed latent TB infection.222-224 Similar to other Mycobacterial infections, treatment of TB requires simultaneous administration of multiple drugs. In theabsence of bacterial resistance, treatment usually consists ofisoniazid (INH), rifampicin, pyrazinamide (PZA), ethambutol (EMB), and streptomycin for 6 months. Although most treatment courses progress with minor side effects, ADRs can occur. No consensus has been reached con-cerning the overall incidence of ADRs to these drugs. Different studies report an incidence of 5.5% to 57.8% according todifferent populations and ADR de nitions. 225-230Adverse effects or drug interactions can make it necessary to modify or discon-tinue treatment. A major ADR to any of the anti-TB drugs, which implicates the discontinuation of that drug, can have severe implications.Alternative agents may lead to greater toxicity and are often lesseffective, frequently requiring longer treatment courses. As aresult, the risk of treatment failure and relapse is higher in these cases. In these patients, management is further complicated by the dif cult task of identifying the culprit agent for the reaction when they are on a typical multidrug regimen. In patients with SCARs, there are reports of further challenge with selected drugs because of the limited availability of treatment; however, as withany other SCAR, avoidance is typically recommended. 231 Rifampin (Rifampicin). Rifampin remains a common ther- apy for latent and active TB, and is also used for infections with aerobic gram-negative organisms including the asymptomatic Neisseria meningitidis carrier state. It is rarely implicated in hy- persensitivity reactions, ranging from pruritic skin eruptions to anaphylaxis, despite its frequent use, but is associated with multiple side effects. Side effects of rifampin include an in fluenza-like syndrome, hepatotoxicity, skin exanthems, and of SMZ-TMP,which may cause signi cant drug-drug interactions. 232The most commonly reported ADR is the in fluenza-like syndrome, whichJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT VOLUME 8, ET AL S33consists of fever, chills, headaches, myalgia, and rash. Published reports have also described rifampin hypersensitivity reactions in both adult and pediatric populations, ranging from pruritic skin eruptions to anaphylaxis.233 Diagnosis of rifampin hypersensitivity can be dif cult, because many reactions are likely not IgE-mediated. Skin testing can be helpful in determining the likelihood of reaction, though nega- tive skin test reactions do not indicate lack of sensitivity. Skintesting should be performed on the basis of published protocols in which the highest intradermal nonirritating drug concentra- 234Similar nonirritating intradermal concentrations have been reported in the literature for evaluation of rifampin hypersensitivity .235 Rifampin is a critical component of anti-TB therapy and often alternative drugs are not available. Therefore, in cases of hyper- sensitivity to rifampin, desensitization to the medication is often required. Recommended dosing of rifampin for TB is 600 mg daily, but maintaining a desensitized state with this dose can beproblematic secondary to the drug 's short half-life of 3 hours. 235,236Despite this, various techniques for desensitization have been published, from rapid protocols to those of 7 or moredays'duration. 235,237Three pediatric case reports have been published.238-240Although uncommon, adverse reaction during rapid desensitization to rifampin may occur. In 1 previouslypublished report, a pediatric patient developed a reaction during the protocol despite premedication, whereas the other 2 patients tolerated rapid desensitization without premedication. Anotherreport described an adult patient who developed anaphylaxisduring an oral desensitization procedure after positive skin testing result. 241 A new, alternating-dose rapid oral desensitization protocol for rifampin was completed in a pediatric patient to achieve appro-priate serum concentrations while safely maintaining the desen- sitized state. 240The protocol used a regimen of 600 mg in the morning followed by 300 mg rifampin in the evening. This dosing was chosen because of the short half-life of rifampin, to maintain desensitization. For oral rifampin, the rapidoral desensitization protocol outlined in Table XXIV is effectiveand safe. Strict adherence to an every-12-hour dosing schedule isrequired to safely maintain the desensitized PZA, a synthetic pyrazine analogue of nico- tinamide, is one of the most effective anti-TB drugs and isgenerally well tolerated. Like any other drug it may cause adverse reactions. These reactions are mainly toxic and may affect several organs: liver (cytolysis), joints (arthralgia), and the gastrointes-tinal system with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. This drug may also induce more severe reactions such as nephrotoxicity, but the most severe one is hepatotoxicity rangingto fulminant hepatitis. Also, the drug most likely responsible for the occurrence of hepatitis during therapy for active TB is PZA. Cutaneous manifestations are the most common reactions to PZA, though true allergic reactions are rare .242-244It can also be associated with early onset of maculopapular rash with pruritus, sometimes in association with dyspnea (possibly due to bron-chospasm) and abdominal pain, suggesting anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction. The mechanisms underlying these re- actions are undetermined. 225,245 Among anti-TB medications, the incidence of serious side effects, de ned as those requiring a documented change in therapy or hospitalization, is highest with PZA. These serious side effects are associated with female sex, older age, Asian origin,and HIV infection. 225 Hypersensitivity reactions should be suspected if an immedi- ate skin rash develops at the initiation of PZA treatment. If thedegree of skin involvement is not severe, sequential reintro-duction of the drugs rst at low, then at full dosage may be attempted. Bavbek et al 246described an allergic reaction in a patient who had positive skin prick test (SPT) result to PZA, with negative results in 10 controls, and a positive oral challenge test result.246 The SPTs were performed with PZA tablets at a concentration of 500 mg/mL along with a positive histamine control and a negative saline control 1 week after the initial reaction. The PZA tablets were smashed in a mortar and diluted with 1 mL of 0.9%NaCI. A positive reaction was seen only with PZA, producing aTABLE XXIII.

In cases of vital indication of this drug, when no alternative treatment is available, drug desensitization is an option(Table XXV ). 225 Isoniazid. INH is a bactericidal antibiotic against M tubercu- losis. It acts by inhibiting mycolic acid biosynthesis. INH also disrupts DNA, lipid, carbohydrate, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthesis, and/or metabolism. The incidence of adverse reactions to INH in more than 2000 patients has beenestimated to be 5.4%. 225,247 Although the incidence of adverse reactions to INH is low, the best described are hepatic, neurologic, skin reactions, and fe-ver. 248-253Skin eruptions are rare, mild, and often transient, and usually consist of morbilliform and maculopapular rashes, urti- caria, and pruritus.254-256Cutaneous reactions in patients receiving therapy are often dif cult to diagnose because several drugs are frequently taken simultaneously. The liver is the mostcommonly affected organ and up to 20% of patients experience mild liver injury, which is usually subclinical and self-limited. 257 A less common form of reaction to INH is hepatitis, a moreserious form of liver injury that can be fatal. The mechanism of liver damage is not completely understood, though it seems related to the direct toxicity of the drug. The diagnosis is based on the regression of symptoms with discontinuation of the drug and the reproducibility with rein-troduction. The reintroduction of antibiotics separately isnecessary to identify the culprit(s). This approach to diagnosis cannot be done in the presence of severe reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis and hepatotoxicity. These are absolutecontraindications for challenge.The rare cases of type I IgE-mediated allergic reaction require study with skin testing, with injectable forms for prick and in- tradermal tests. 258 Rodrigues Carvalho et al259performed skin testing in a case of a generalized maculopapular rash, fever, and diarrhea after treatment with several anti-TB drugs. Prick test (PT) with INH was performed with an undiluted solution of 100 mg/mL and IDT with a 10 mg/mL concentration. Several protocols have been published regarding the desensi- tization to INH based on adapted protocols bacteriostatic antimycobacterial drug most commonly used in combination with other drugs in the treatment of TB. The mechanism of action is not completely known. There is evidence that the drug exerts its bacteriostaticactivity by inhibiting arabinosyltransferase, an enzyme that arabinose into arabinan and then arabinogalactan, a mycobacterial cell wall constituent. The dose of EMB is dependent on body weight, frequency of administration, and indication. It is generally well tolerated. Sideeffects are usually dose-related and more common when dosesexceed 15 mg/kg. The main side effect of EMB is ocular toxicity due to optic neuritis. Intermittent dosing may decrease the risk of oculartoxicity, as con rmed by Grif th et al 262in a study of 229 pa- tients treated with EMB for pulmonary M avium complex disease. The combination of EMB with PZA for the treatment of latent TB in patients exposed to multidrug-resistant strains has been associated with a high incidence of hepatotoxicity or gastrointestinal intolerance, leading to discontinuation of therapy(w60% of treated subjects in 1 report). 263 Hypersensitivity reactions to EMB such as rash and drug fever have been reported in 0.5% and 0.3% of patients, respec-tively. 264Other pigmentation, lichenoid eruptions, pulmonary in ltrates, and TEN, have also been described.265-268 In cases of severe reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, oral challenge tests are not recommended. Skin and serological tests are usually unreliable, with single reports of positive patch-testTABLE XXIV.

Immediate reading can be negative with late positiveintradermal readings. 270The decision to desensitize should be made in conjunction with the infectious disease specialist todetermine the bene to frst-line therapy over alternatives, the duration of treatment, and the goals of therapy. Drug desensitization should not be attempted in cases of se- vere skin reactions or those involving the mouth or mucousmembranes exfoliative dermatitis summarize one institution' s protocols that were used for several patients from the infectious diseasedepartment who had cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions toEMB. Rodrigues Carvalho et al 259described successful use of a modi ed 1-day temporary induction of tolerance protocol in a patient with reactions to several anti-TB drugs. The protocol consisted of a 2-fold increase in drug dose every 45 minutes until the desired total daily dose was reached. Another protocol was used in a clinically non-IgE hypersen- sitivity reaction to EMB in which the previously described pro-tocol was ineffective. 44The patient had facial erythema, angioedema of the neck and upper limbs followed by a pruritic scaling maculopapular exanthem involving the neck, trunk, and upper and lower limbs, associated with mild dyspnea with nohemodynamic change 2 months before nishing treatment with EMB. Symptoms resolved after stopping the drug and reap- peared after reintroduction. Skin tests were performed using solutions of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prepared from diluting acrushed 400-mg EMB tablet. 271Immediate reading result was negative, but a positive intradermal reaction was present at 6hours, with resolution at 72 hours. Because of the clinical pre-sentation, positive delayed skin testing result, and reproducibility of the reaction on reexposure, a hypersensitivity reaction to EMB was diagnosed. The applied protocol was designed on the basis ofthe 12-step protocol by Castells et al ( Table XXX), using slowerdose increments and premedication with 25 mg of hydroxyzineand 40 mg of oral prednisone. 271,272 Streptomycin. Streptomycin is in the aminoglycoside class of medications and can be used to treat TB in combination withother medications. It works by blocking the ability of 30S ri-bosomal subunits to make proteins that result in bacterial death. Common side effects include dizziness, vomiting, numbness of the face, fever, and rash. 159 Most ADRs due to intramuscular injection of streptomycin are gastrointestinal problems (38.09%), followed by is vestibulotoxic, ototoxic, can potentially interfere with the diagnosis ofkidney malfunction. The most concerning side effects, as with other aminoglycosides, are nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are more likely to be found when therapy is continued for more than 5 days and at higher doses. In very high doses, streptomycin can also produce a curare-like ef-fect with neuromuscular blockade that results in respiratoryTABLE XXVI.

However, a cautiousapproach must be taken when evaluating anaphylactic reactionsto streptomycin, because systemic reactions have been observedafter skin prick testing. The starting concentrations suggested for SPTs range from 0.1 to 1 mg/mL, gradually reaching the con- centration of 20 mg/mL if tolerated. If SPT results are negative,intradermal testing can be performed and nonirritating concen- trations of 4 mg/mL for intradermal testing have been established for gentamicin and tobramycin. There is no evidence of positiveserum IgE to aminoglycosides. Patch tests with reading at 72 and 96 hours are recommended for the diagnosis of nonimmediate reactions. The concentration is 1% in petrolatum forstreptomycin. 275In patients with streptomycin hypersensitivity, avoidance of the antibiotic is recommended. There are 2 reports of desensi- tization to streptomycin, one describing a 3-hour protocol with streptomycin beginning with 1 mg administered intravenouslyand the other consisting of streptomycin given intramuscularly, 10 mg, on the rst day and doubled every day until it reached 800 mg, then 1.0 g, twice weekly. 276,277Patients reached 1.0 g of streptomycin on the ninth day. Metronidazole (by Sara Barmettler, MD) General. Metronidazole is a 5-nitroimidazol compound that is active against a wide array of anaerobes, protozoa, and micro- aerophilic bacteria. Metronidazole is the treatment of choice for most anaerobic infections, including mild to moderate C dif cile infections.278The 5-nitroimidazole drugs (including metroni- dazole or tinidazole) are the only class of drugs that provide curative therapy for trichomoniasis and thus, given the low ef- cacy of any drug other than the 5-nitroimidazole drugs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recom- mend that patients with trichomoniasis who have experienced an IgE-mediated allergy to metronidazole and/or tinidazole be referred for desensitization rather than using an alternative classof drugs. 279 Major symptoms. A number of nonallergic adverse effects of metronidazole have been described, including gastrointestinalsymptoms, nervous system effects, genitourinary effects, anddisulram-like reactions. 278Hypersensitivity reactions caused by metronidazole appear to be rare, and case reports have beeninfrequently described in the literature. Several types of reactionshave been reported, including immediate reactions and anaphylaxis, delayed reactions, xed drug eruption, serum sickness elike reaction, and SJS/TEN. 280-285 Diagnosis. Skin testing for metronidazole hypersensitivity has been described.280,286Skin prick testing was performed at a concentration of 125 mg/mL. Using this concentration, a patient tested in 1 study had previously suspected anaphylaxis to metronidazole and was positive on skin prick testing on 2 different occasions.280This case report also found skin prick testing result with metronidazole to be negative in 10 controlpatients. 280In another case series, 4 patients with a history of cutaneous pruritic exanthemas were skin tested with prick testingat a concentration of 125 mg/mL of metronidazole followed byIDT with metronidazole at 0.5%, 5%, and 10%, with readings including delayed readings at 48 and 96 hours. 286One patient had a positive result on the metronidazole SPT and did not undergo oral challenge. Oral challenge with doses of 250 to 500 mg provoked symptoms within 45 minutes to 1 hour in 2 pa- tients and after 7 hours in the third. These patients were treatedwith intravenous corticosteroids and antihistamines with reso-lution. Ten control subjects who tested negative on skin prick testing passed an oral challenge to metronidazole in that study. 286These results call into question the utility of skin testing to metronidazole. Management. In patients who require metronidazole, but for whom there is documented positive skin testing result or a highclinical suspicion for immediate hypersensitivity reaction, and there are no alternative agents available or the alternative agents are not preferred (such as for trichomoniasis, as described before),desensitization can be performed. There are publishedTABLE XXX.

Antimalarials (by Sara Barmettler, MD) General. Antimalarial drugs are used for the treatment and prophylaxis of malarial infection. Most antimalarial drugs target the erythrocytic stage of malaria infection, which is the phase ofinfection that causes symptomatic illness. There are several classes of antimalarial drugs including quinoline derivatives, antifolates, antimicrobials, and artemisinin derivatives. The an-timicrobials used in malaria treatment and prophylaxis will not be described in this section. Major symptoms. Quinoline derivatives include chloro- quine, quinine, me floquine, and primaquine. Chloroquine was one of the rst antimalarials produced on a large scale; however, there is increasing resistance to chloroquine in many malaria- endemic countries. Commonly described side effects of chloro- quine include headaches, dizziness, abdominal discomfort, vomiting, and diarrhea.294Chloroquine-induced pruritus has been described, most frequently in African populations, is tran- sient (lasting 48-72 hours), and is not responsive to antihista- mines.295Chloroquine has also been described to cause TEN, and other reactions including xed drug eruption, bullous pemphigoid, exfoliative dermatitis, with cinchonism, which includes a number of unpleasant adverse effects including nausea, headache,tinnitus, dysphoria, and blurred vision. 297Pruritus, skin flush- ing, and urticaria are associated described in case reports. 297 Mefloquine has been associated with a number of adverse effects including skin reactions such as pruritus (frequency of4%-10%) and maculopapular rash (frequency of 30%). 298As- sociations have also been drawn between facial lesions, cutaneous vasculitis, Mefloquine known to cause serious neuropsychiatric toxicity, including seizures, encephalopathy, and psychosis, which occurin 0.1% to 5% of patients treated for malaria. 299Other adverse effects include vomiting and dizziness.297 Primaquine is the only 8-aminoquinoline in clinical use and is generally well tolerated. It can cause hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate ef cacy and tolerability when used for prophylaxis and treatment. The most common sideeffects included headache, gastrointestinal symptoms of abdom- inal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cough.300,301 Atovaquone has been associated with SJS as well as acute eosinophilic pneumonia and maculopapular rash.302,303One case of anaphylaxis was described during clinical trials.304The combination of chloroquine and proguanil has also beendescribed to cause AGEP and cutaneous vasculitis. rare but serious adverse effect is drug-induced hypersensitivity syn-drome or DRESS. Up to 3.6% of dapsone recipients develop thissyndrome, and as many as 13% of these die as a result. 307 The artemisinin derivatives have excellent ef cacy and safety, with very few attributable adverse effects.308One study reported an incidence of type I hypersensitivity reactions including urti-caria and anaphylaxis at 0.03%. 309 Diagnosis. There are rare case reports in which skin testing was used to evaluate for a type I hypersensitivity reaction to antimalarial agents. Unfortunately, there is no standardized nonirritating concentration of these drugs that both uses negativecontrols to establish nonirritating concentrations and identi es a positive case-control with a suggestive history. Speci cally, skin prick testing has been described for atovaquone-proguanil, butthe concentration used was not published and there was nomention of negative controls tested. 310Similarly, in another case report, result of epicutaneous testing performed with chloro-quine, proguanil, and me floquine was negative, but again, there was no mention of the concentration used or whether there were negative controls. Patch testing for several antimalarial drugs (including malarone, proguanil, atovaquone, quinine, chloro-quine, and me floquine) has been described, with the drugs diluted at 30% in a petrolatum base. 303 Management. In most literature describing hypersensitivity reactions, management includes cessation of the suspected culpritdrug and selection of an alternate therapy. Given the largenumber of different classes of medications available for thetreatment and prophylaxis of malaria, the selection of an alter- native agent with equal ef cacy generally has not provided an unsurmountable challenge, and thus there is a lack of speci c oral challenge protocols or desensitization protocols available forantimalarial agents. Antiparasitics (by Sara Barmettler, MD) General. Antiparasitics are a class of medications used to treat diseases caused by nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, amoeba, and protozoa. The main type of antiparasitic drug is the anti-helminthic group, which includes the antinematodes andTABLE XXXI.

Major symptoms. Ivermectin is a semisynthetic derivative of avermectin and is useful in the treatment of a parasiticinfections, including gastrointestinal upset, abdominal pain, fatigue, urticarial or maculopapular rashes,pruritus, and rarely, hepatotoxicity or neurologic side effects, andit has been implicated in a mucosal drug eruption with hemor- rhagic scabs/erosions. 311,313-315Ivermectin has also been described to cause a Mazzotti-type reaction (pruritus and aden- opathy due to dying micro laria) after the treatment of onchocerciasis.311 The benzimidazole class of includes albendazole, mebendazole, thiabendazole, and triclabendazole. Side effects ofalbendazole include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as rare side effects of transient transaminitis, agranulocytosis, and urticarial or other dermatologic manifesta-tions. 316,317Contact urticaria contact dermatitis have been described in association with albendazole.318Albendazole has also been reported to cause xed drug reaction.319The side-effect prole of mebendazole is similar to that of albendazole and in- cludes gastrointestinal symptoms such as mild abdominal painand diarrhea, as well as urticaria, pruritus, and edema. 320More serious cutaneous manifestations have been reported with thecombination of mebendazole and metronidazole, which was associated with an outbreak of SJS/TEN. 321A number of adverse reactions have been described with the use of thiabendazole, including dizziness, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, pruritus, headache, neuropsychiatric disturbances, hepatitis, and hyper- sensitivity reactions such as SJS.320,322 Praziquantel has activity against cestodes and trematodes including parasites such as schistosomiasis, intestinal tapeworms,cysticercosis, and other flukes. Side effects include headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, and abdominal discomfort, and less commonly, itching/rash. 323Although rare, hypersensitivity re- actions to praziquantel have been described.324-327Interestingly, mouse model data have suggested that anaphylactic reactions may be induced by parasite antigen release rather than true hy- persensitivity reactions to the praziquantel.328 Diethylcarbamazine is a loiasis, and visceral larva migrans. Side effects include fever, headache, dizziness, gastrointestinal symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea, and urticaria/pruri-tus. 320Administration of diethylcarbamazine in the setting of onchocerciasis is associated with a risk of precipitating theMazzotti reaction (which includes symptoms of fever, urticaria,tender lymphadenopathy, tachycardia, arthralgias, edema,abdominal pain, and hypotension, and include efl ornithine, melarsoprol, tinidazole, and metronidazole. E flornithine is effective in the early and late central nervous system stage of infections with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense but not Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. include diarrhea, anemia, leukopenia, andhair loss. 330Melarsoprol is used to treat late-stage African trypanosomiasis. Use of melarsoprol is limited by its toxicity, which occurs commonly and includes severe adverse effects suchas encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, exfoliative dermatitis,myocarditis, and hypersensitivity reactions such re- actions. 330,331Please see separate section on metronidazole for a detailed description of hypersensitivity reactions associated with the use of this drug. Antimalarials are also discussed in detail in a separate section. Diagnosis. A few case reports describe the use of skin testing in the evaluation for a type I hypersensitivity reaction to anti-parasitic agents. Skin prick testing and intradermal testing have been described for mebendazole and albendazole. 332However, despite negative skin prick testing and intradermal testing results for mebendazole and albendazole, the patient in that case developed hives on oral challenge with both medications, thussuggesting a poor predictive value of this skin test. 332Skin prick testing and intradermal testing have been described for prazi- quantel, and results for both were positive in the patient tested; however, that report did not mention the concentrations used orwhether negative controls were used to establish nonirritating concentrations of the drug. 325Patch testing for albendazole has been described, with 4 of 9 patients tested having positive results, though notably the patient with a clinical history of contact dermatitis did not test positive.318 Management. Management of hypersensitivity reactions in most cases reported involved cessation of the suspected culprit drug and selection of alternate therapy. Rarely, case reports have described desensitization to the antiparasitic agent. Desensitiza- tion has been described for praziquantel.324,325In 1 case, oral desensitization to praziquantel was attempted using a modi ed desensitization protocol with increasing doses of 30, 60, 100,150, 300, 600, and 1200 mg administered 90 minutes apart.The patient described in this case did develop symptoms requiring hydrocortisone, antihistamine, and an H 2-blocker treatment during the desensitization, but was able to tolerate therapeutic doses of praziquantel given for 3 days subse- quently.325In another case, desensitization was attempted using 13 doses of praziquantel at 15-minute intervals ( rst 6 doses were 18 mg each, the next 3 were 180 mg each, and the nal 3 were 360 mg each). In this case, the patient developed generalizedurticaria, dif culty swallowing, and chest tightness within 1 hour of his last dose. He was able to receive praziquantel on subse- quent days without symptoms but was also given concomitant corticosteroids, so it was unclear whether true desensitization was achieved. 324Oral challenge has been reported in the case of xed drug eruption secondary to albendazole, with cross-reactivity reported with metronidazole.319 Antifungals (by Stephanie Logsdon, MD) General. Antifungal medications including the azoles have been used in treatment and prophylaxis for various fungal in- fections for decades, while newer antifungal medications, including the echinocandin class, have gained increasingly widespread use in the treatment of pediatric and adult fungalinfections. The azole drug class is composed of miconazole). These drugs disrupt the fungal cell membrane through impairment of ergosterol synthesis. 333Each drug in the azole class has distinctive indications for use, ranging from mucosal candidiasis to invasive mycoses. These VOLUME 8, NUMBER 9SBROYLES ET AL S39critical for managing the increasing frequency of fungal infections in all age groups, while offering a cost-effective option for pro- phylaxis in immunosuppressed patients.334Azoles are available in oral, intravenous, and topical formulations. Ketoconazole and miconazole are associated with increased rates of toxicity with administration, while newer triazoles have improved safety pro- les and reduced drug-drug interactions, and are generally well tolerated in adult and pediatric patients. All azoles exhibit inhi- bition of the CYP450 class both of which inhibit b-(1,3)- D-glucan synthase. The frequency of invasive fungal infections is increasing in all age groups, thus escalating the need for effective therapies such as theechinocandins. 335These medications have fewer adverse events and drug-drug interactions, and improved safety pro les over other antifungal agents. This is important because many patientswho receive micafungin or caspofungin have other serious un-derlying medical illnesses. Both medications are administered intravenously, because their large molecular weight precludes acceptable gastrointestinal absorption. Importantly, neither agentappreciably affects the SMZ-TMP system, thus reducing the amount of drug-drug interactions. Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported for both azoles and echinocandins. The most common ADRs to the azole drug class include hepa-totoxicity, skin exanthems, and gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, each individual azole carries a distinctive side-effect prole. 333,334Multiple case reports describe TEN, xed drug eruptions, and other hypersensitivity reactions including imidazoles, posaconazole, and isavuconazole is not well described. Common ADRs to the echinocandin drug class include transaminitis, electrolyte imbalances, fever, and skin exanthems.340,341There are single case reports describing the development of secondary TEN and hypersensitivity to caspo- fungin use in adult patients.342,343Beyond case reports, hyper- sensitivity to micafungin and caspofungin is not well described in the literature. Diagnosis. Although skin prick testing for azoles is not vali- dated, case reports have described protocols. Skin testing was performed in an adult patient with a history of anaphylaxis to voriconazole and 2 control patients. In this case report, testingcomprised prick testing with 0.5 mg/mL and 0.05 mg/mL vor- iconazole with negative saline control. The patient had a positive result with the 0.5-mg/mL dilution, whereas both control pa-tients had negative results to this dilution. 339Skin testing to fluconazole has also been described in case reports. An adult patient who developed cutaneous and respiratory symptomsduring treatment with fluconazole underwent intradermal skin testing with 0.2 mg/mL of the drug. Her skin test result was positive, whereas the skin test result was negative in a nonallergic control patient. 344No further skin testing protocols are obtain- able. Therefore, skin testing may be helpful for the diagnosis of hypersensitivity to azoles, but further investigation into ideal concentrations is needed. Skin prick testing for the echinocandins is not well validated as well. Only 1 published description of skin testing to caspofunginwas found during a literature review. Skin testing was completedon an adult patient with history of anaphylaxis to micafungin.This test included 1 intradermal injection of 0.05 mg caspo-fungin with a normal saline negative control. 343No further skin testing protocols are available. Therefore, obtaining a completeclinical history remains critical in the diagnosis of echinocandinhypersensitivity because appropriate skin testing concentrations remain unclear. Management. Drug desensitization protocols have been published for oral fluconazole, oral itraconazole, and intravenous voriconazole.336,339There is extensive variability in the protocols used for fluconazole desensitization, with protocol durations ranging from hours to days (Table XXXII ).337,338,344For IgE- mediated allergy, preference should be given to desensitizationsthat occur over hours, rather than a prolonged protocol. No intravenous desensitization protocols for fluconazole are pub- lished. Each protocol was completed without signi cant systemic reactions, indicating that desensitization to azoles may be safely completed. Continued inquiry into the management of hyper- sensitivity to azole antifungals is necessary, because these medi-cations continue to be critically required. Micafungin and caspofungin are becoming critical therapeutic agents for patients with disseminated or virulent fungal in-fections, and thus these medications will likely be required in the future for use in patients who have hypersensitivity reactions to these medications. Drug desensitization may be an importanttool for these patients. A recently published desensitization regimen used a standard 12-step protocol that has been suc- cessfully used with antibiotics such as penicillin(Table XXXIII ). 345The entire protocol was completed without reaction, and the patient completed the remainder of her ther- apeutic course uneventfully. This indicates that rapid de- sensitizations can be successfully completed in a safe and effectivemanner. Strict adherence to the dosing schedule is required to safely maintain the desensitized state. Further investigation into these medications will help physicians evaluate and manageechinocandin hypersensitivities. Antivirals (by Tito Rodriguez, MD, and Elizabeth Phillips, MD) Antiretrovirals General. More than 30 antiretroviral (ART) drugs are currently available in the United States for the treatment of HIV- 1, and these include 6 FDA-approved single-tablet regimens of 3 or more drugs as of March 2016. Six different categories of ARTdrugs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside/ tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, [PIs], inhibitors [including fusion inhibitors and CCR5 in-hibitors], and integrase inhibitors) can be used in combinations of 3 or more drugs. Current treatment recommendations are to initiate combination ART drugs in all patients with HIV. 346-348 Nearly all ART drugs have been implicated in hypersensitivityreactions, usually presenting as delayed onset and ranging from the usual mild exanthem to less common life-threatening SJS/ TEN or DRESS ( Table XXXIV ) reactions, with type I hyper- sensitivity reactions rarely seen. 349These reactions can be confused by the presence of underlying opportunistic infections,immune restoration disease, or the fact that HIV-infected pa-tients may take other drugs for prophylaxis of opportunistic in- fections that can also cause the full spectrum of clinically indistinguishable hypersensitivity reactions (eg, on current evidence-based medicine, there should be no restrictions on who gets ART drugs and this should be considered in all patients after individual discussion and con-siderations presenting with HIV-1 regardless of CD4 \u00feT-cell count, viral load, or AIDS-de ning illness history. From older data, hypersensitivity reactions have been described as occurring1 0 0t i m e sm o r ec o m m o n l yi nH I V - i n f e c t e dp a t i e n t st h a ni nt h e general population, but data from contemporary HIV pop- ulations are lacking. 349In general, diagnosis of hypersensitivity reactions related to HIV therapy is made on the basis of clinicalpresentation, temporal relatio nship with drug exposure (typi- cally 1-6 weeks), and exclusion of other etiologies.346Patients presenting with mild rash alone without fever or organinvolvement can develop tolerance with continued dosing anduninterrupted treatment is recommended (eg, efavirenz and PIs). 349, 350 Major symptoms and management. Abacavir, a nucle- oside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, is a common cause of severehypersensitivity reactions, occurring in 2.3% to 9% of patients exposed to the drug. 349The clinical syndrome of abacavir hy- persensitivity includes fever, constitutional symptoms, and gastrointestinal disturbance. Rash is later in onset, and may be absent in up to 30% of patients.349These reactions have been associated with the presence of the MHC class I allele HLA-B*5701. 349,351-353In clinical trials, HLA testing has shown of HLA-B*5701 for skin patch-test 100% negativepredictive genetic screening for HLA-B*5701 has been part of guideline-based therapy before abacavir prescription since 2008. 349,351-353A history of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions is an absolute contraindication to rechallenge, because subsequent reactions are often more rapid and severe than the initial reac- tion.349,351-353 Particularly with the advent of HLA-B*5701 screening, contemporary single-tablet regimens used as rst-line ART therapy in clinical practice in the United States are associatedwith a very low risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Abacavir hypersensitivity is unique compared with other drug hypersensitivity syndromes in that fever and malaise can developwithin the rst few days of initial dosing and with relatively late and inconsistent (70%) appearance of rash. The clinical symp- toms, signs, and pharmacogenomics of other drug hypersensi- are outlined in Table XXXIV . 349Currently, abacavir is the only ART drug with an associated hypersensitivity for which a guideline-approved pharmacogenomic pretreatment and preventive screening strategy exists.349HLA-B*5701 testing before prescription of abacavir has become consistent practice inthe developed world but is still not widely used in regions where either abacavir is not widely used (eg, Africa) or where the allele frequency of HLA-B*5701 is less than 1% (South and SoutheastAsia, excluding Northern Thailand) and India where HLA- B*5701 carriage rate is as high as 10%. 353 Immediate reactions have been rarely reported, and there are no standardized protocols for skin prick and intradermaltesting. 354 Antie hepatitis C drugs. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects more than 170 million people g lobally. Traditional HCV treatment, which included peg ylated IFN and ribavirin, had a low ef cacy (45%) and has now been largely replaced by the direct-acting agents. In all HCV treatment regimens, the ratesof rash were high, noted in up to 20% to 30% of cases. 349 Early direct-acting agents, such as the HCV NS3.4A serine PI telaprevir developed for geno type 1 HCV infection, in com- bination with ribavirin and IFN, have now largely beenreplaced with newer direct-acting agents. Telaprevir-associatedrash was described in 50% or more of those initiating therapy, with more than 90% of these being mild to moderate eczematous rashes that were controlled symptomatically withantihistamines dose 197.76 mg Step ConcentrationVolume administered (mL)Dose administered (mg)Cumulative dose (mg) 1 0.02 1.00 0.02 0.02 2 0.02 2.00 0.04 0.06 3 0.02 4.00 0.08 0.14 4 0.2 0.80 0.16 0.30 5 0.2 1.60 0.32 0.62 6 0.2 3.20 0.64 1.26 7 2 0.75 1.50 2.76 8 2 1.50 3.00 5.76 9 2 3.00 6.00 11.76 10 20 0.60 12.00 23.76 11 20 1.20 24.00 47.76 12 20 2.50 50.00 97.76 13 20 5.00 100.00 197.76 PO, Per os (by mouth); q24h, every 24 h. *Fifteen-minute intervals are given between doses.

Newer direct-acting agents have infrequently been associated with skin rash.

There have been no reports of photo- patch testing that would accurate ly and reliably differentiate between phototoxicity and photosensitivity. Reports in the literature have been mixed, wi th early reports suggesting an allergic and a lichenoid pattern on histology favoringphototoxicity. 356,357Diagnosis of anti-HCV drug hypersen- is based on clinical assessment of the syndrome.TABLE XXXIV.

Hypersensitivity reactions to herpes virus antivirals are infrequent, usually consisting of contact allergy or delayedsystemic reactions most frequently described for acyclovir. Immediate reactions have been described, but skin testing is not well standardized and it has been described only in case re-ports with none or low number of controls. 358Patch testing has been shown to be useful in case reports at 10% or higher con- centration, but there are no data on its sensitivity and predictive values.359Other than abacavir there are no data on the diagnostic utility of patch testing for other antivirals. Cross-reactivity among structurally related acyclovir, valaciclovir, and famciclovir is partial, with approximately 50% of patients tolerating famci-clovir after reaction to valacyclovir or acyclovir; therefore, chal- lenge with a suitable alternative after a negative patch-test result must be considered before desensitization. 360 Hypersensitivity reactions to in fluenza antivirals are limited to individual case reports that do not include details on cross-re- activities or skin testing standardization. Anaphylaxis and delayed reactions have been reported to oseltamivir.361 Desensitization. Desensitization protocols to ART drugs have been described for patients with severe delayed reactionslimited to the skin where the speci c antiviral agent was the only possible treatment for that patient (Table XXXV ). 362,363 Although failures have been reported in several case reports withrapid desensitization protocols to enfuvirtide, it remains thepreferred method due to the unknown risk of resistance with slow desensitization protocols. 362If the rapid protocol fails, a published 2- to 3-day slow desensitization protocol can be used.364Because the mechanism underlying delayed antiviral hypersensitivity to most antivirals remains unclear, such slow protocols should be used with caution and only when no alter- native therapeutic option is possible. Desensitization is contra-indicated in patients who have experienced severe, life- threatening immunocytotoxic reactions, vasculitis, or bullous skin diseases such SJS/TEN and DHS/DRESS and for aba-cavir in HLA-B*5701 epositive patients. 270 The role of skin testing or desensitization for HCV antivirals has not been determined, but 2 case reports have described slowdesensitization protocols for ribavirin. 365Desensitization has been described in immediate reactions con rmed by challenge and in some unclear delayed reactions for herpes simplex virusantivirals. No desensitization protocol to in fluenza antiviral has been described. CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS Carboplatin (by Sarita Patil, MD) General. In oncology patients, repeated administration of platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents can result in the development of hypersensitivity.366,367In particular, the inci- dence of hypersensitivity reactions increases from 1% after the rst dose of carboplatin to 27% after 7 doses.366The peak rate of hypersensitivity reactions occurs with the eighth or ninth dose,which often corresponds with the second or third cycle afterrestarting treatment for malignancy recurrence. 368Drugdesensitization has been found to effectively deliver carboplatinto patients with hypersensitivity. 272 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Hypersensitivity reactions to carboplatin range from flushing, pruritus, urticaria) to systemic anaphylaxis, dened as involving more than 2 organ systems, often with cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and cardiac symptoms.Up to 50% of reactions include moderately severe reactions. 272 These reported hypersensitivity reactions do not include SJS,TEN, erythema multiforme, or serum sickness. Diagnosis. In addition to a clinical history of reactions consistent with hypersensitivity, skin testing can aid in thediagnosis of carboplatin hypersensitivity. Standard carboplatin skin testing protocols use step-wise skin prick testing (10 mg/ mL) and 3-step intradermal testing (0.1, 1, and either 3 or 5 mg/mL) with 0.02 mL, in addition to a positive control (0.1 mg/mL histamine base) and a negative control (saline). Higher intra- dermal skin testing concentrations (10 mg/mL) cause irritationand carry a risk of skin necrosis. 368A positive skin test result can be de ned as a wheal-and- flare reaction, with the wheal 's greatest diameter being at least 3 mm larger than that seen with saline.369 Because of potential for false-negative skin testing results in certain patients, particularly in those with a recent history of anaphylaxis (within 4-6 weeks of skin testing), repeat skin testing is recommended for patients whose clinical history is consistentwith a hypersensitivity reaction and who have a negative initial skin test result on evaluation. These patients 'condition can be managed with desensitization while they are awaiting repeat skin testing. 369,370 Management. In patients with carboplatin hypersensitivity, desensitization with a 12-step protocol ( Table XXXVI )i na monitored setting (in an inpatient setting supervised by an al-lergy specialist) has been effective in delivering adequate chemotherapeutic doses to patients requiring therapy. A 13-step protocol similar to the 12-step protocol, with an additional 60mL/h step between steps 11 and 12, can also be used.TABLE XXXV.

Antihistamine pre- medication is recommended before the use of these desensitiza-tion protocols. 368,369 Low-risk patients who have a history of nonpruritic, non- blistering delayed rash or those who have a negative skin testresult between 6 weeks and 6 months after their initial hyper-sensitivity reactions and who are therefore at a lower risk of having a falsely negative skin test result may be candidates to receive carboplatin by infusion at 50% of the standard infusionrate in an outpatient infusion center setting. 370 For premedication, patients are advised to use 20 mg of oral cetirizine on the evening before desensitization, the morning ofdesensitization, and immediately before initiation of desensi-tization, but no data are available on optimal premedication regimens. In addition, before the start of the desensitization protocol, patients with initial skin symptoms such as pruritusor urticaria can be given oral or intravenous diphenhydramine 25 mg and oral ranitidine 150 mg (intravenous ranitidine 50 mg or famotidine can be substituted). Patients with mildcutaneous symptoms ( flushing, erythema) as part of their hy- persensitivity reactions may also bene tf r o mp r e m e d i c a t i o n with oral aspirin 325 mg on the night before their desensiti-zation and again 1 hour before their desensitization protocolbegins. During desensitization, hypersensitivity reactions are treated with cessation of the protocol and administration of intravenousdiphenhydramine 50 mg for mild reactions. More severe or recurrent reactions are treated with intravenous methylprednis- olone 60 mg, and systemic anaphylaxis should withintramuscular epinephrine 0.3 mg. Once hypersensitivity reac- tion symptoms resolve, the desensitization can be resumed at a previous step and completed. Oxaliplatin (by David Hong, MD) General. Oxaliplatin is a third-generation platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent most commonly used to treat metastatic colon cancer in combination with leucovorin and fluorouracil (FOLFOX regimen). As with cisplatin and carboplatin, the risk of developing type I hypersensitivity reactions increases with successive exposures. Most patients develop reactions after the sixth treatment cycle, with the incidence being as high as 20%,comparable to that of carboplatin (incidence 27% after the sixth dose). 272 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Symptoms of oxaliplatin hypersensitivity are typical of a mast cell emediated process; common symptoms include flushing, pruritus, urti- caria, and back pain. Cardiovascular and respiratory anaphylaxis is less common but has greater life-threatening potential. Lesscommonly, reactions featuring fever and chills/rigors with or without hypotension, nausea, and diarrhea have been described in case reports. IL-6 and TNF- alevels are often elevated acutely, and these reactions have been described as \"idiosyncratic \"or \"cytokine storm elike.\" Diagnosis. Oxaliplatin hypersensitivity appears to dominantly IgE-mediated because skin testing using skin prickand intradermal testing appears to have a high negative predictivevalue, ranging from 80% to 100%, and a positive predictive value of 66% to 80% when skin prick and intradermal testing is performed. Typically, testing involves skin prick testing withoxaliplatin at 1 to 5 mg/mL, to be followed, if the result is negative, by intradermal testing using 10-fold serial dilutions starting at 10 /C02and 10/C01dilutions and undiluted.371-373 Symptoms of skin irritation, including injection-site pain and erythema, are more common with higher strengths of intrader- mal testing. In cases with a clinical history suggestive of type Ihypersensitivity to oxaliplatin but negative skin test result, it may be appropriate to repeat testing after subsequent infusions of oxaliplatin, especially if there have been 8 or more previouslifetime exposures to oxaliplatin. 374Conversion to a positive skin test result in such patients would deem them candidates for desensitization if continuing oxaliplatin therapy is desired. Management. Type I hypersensitivity to oxaliplatin can be managed by desensitization in most cases. Various protocols have been used, with the total duration of infusion ranging from 90minutes to 16 hours. Castells et al have described the greatest number of patients desensitized to platin-based chemothera- peutics using a 12-step protocol with three 10-fold dilutions ofthe drug given over approximately 6 hours. An example 12-step desensitization protocol is included in Table XXXVIII. Most protocols premedicate patients with antihistamines to minimize the risk and/or severity of breakthrough reactions withdesensitization. Additional premedication with a combination of aspirin and montelukast appears to be helpful for those patientswhose reactions have prominently included flushing, thought to be mediated by the release of prostaglandins, and other in flam- matory lipid mediators generated as a consequence of mast cellactivation. The literature describing idiosyncratic/cytokine storm elike reaction is quite limited, but management seems to revolvearound intense premedication regimens of steroids with orwithout antihistamines. 375Coadministration of intravenous fluids and infusion rate reduction have also been found to be useful interventions. The role for desensitization in this clinicalscenario is not yet de ned. Taxanes (by Matthieu Picard, MD) General. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel and docetaxel occur in around 10% of patients, most commonly on rst exposure, despite premedication with antihistamines and corticosteroids.376-378Nab-paclitaxel and cabazitaxel are less frequently associated with such reactions.377Cremophor-EL (contained in the paclitaxel formulation) and polysorbate 80(contained in the docetaxel and cabazitaxel formulation) are thought to be responsible for immediate hypersensitivity re-actions because they can cause complement activation and generate anaphylatoxins. 377An IgE-mediated mechanism could also be responsible for some of these reactions.378,379 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Most immediate reactions are moderate in severity, with the most frequently re- ported symptoms being skin flushing, dyspnea, chest pain, and back pain.376,378In patients with hypotension, a serum tryptase level can be measured; an elevated supports reaction. docetaxel can cause nonimmediate skin re- actions with onset from 12 hours to 15 days after the infusion.378 These reactions are most frequently characterized by flushing or by a maculopapular skin eruption.378 Although much less common, severe hypersensitivity association with paclitaxel, docetaxel, and nab-paclitaxel. 377 Diagnosis. Skin testing can be used to guide the method of reexposure: desensitization versus challenge in patients with animmediate taxane-induced hypersensitivity reaction. 378Con- centrations used for paclitaxel skin testing range from 1 to 6 mg/mL (SPT) and from 0.001 to 6 mg/mL (IDT). 378,380False- positive results can occur at 6 mg/mL (IDT).380Concentrations used for docetaxel skin testing range from 4 to 10 mg/mL (SPT) and from 0.04 to 10 mg/mL (IDT).378,380Skin testing with cabazitaxel and nab-paclitaxel has not been reported. Management. Following an immediate taxane-induced hy- persensitivity reaction, reexposure through a regular or slowed infusion with or without additional premedication appears to betolerated by many patients. 376,380,381However, severe reactions were reported with this approach and desensitization can be usedas an alternative, especially in patients with a positive skin testresponse and/or a moderate to severe initial hypersensitivity re- action ( Figure 4 ). 376,378,380,381The risk of recurrent reaction appears to decrease with repeated exposures, and desensitization protocols can be progressively shortened in patients with goodtolerance to eventually perform a challenge and, if tolerated,resume regular infusions (Table XXXIX ). 378,381 Patients with a delayed skin reaction and a positive skin test response may be at risk of an immediate hypersensitivity reactionon reexposure and may require desensitization. 378The risk of a recurrent delayed reaction also decreases with repeated exposuresand many can eventually tolerate regular infusions. 378In contrast, patients with severe nonimmediate Methotrexate (by Andrew MacGinnitie, MD, PhD, and Min Jung Lee, MD) General. Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate chemotherapy and immunosuppressant agent that is used for the management of osteosarcoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and rheumatoid arthritis, along with other autoimmune diseases in adults and children. It inhibits the activity of dihydrofolate reductase, whichis needed for de novo purine synthesis. Adverse effects, more commonly seen with high doses used in cancer therapy, include abdominal cramping, malaise, mucositis, myelosuppression, and renal and ress to has also been reported.383Although the incidence of hypersensitivity reaction is unknown, it is likely rare,and case reports of anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions havebeen described. 384,385 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity.

The sensitivity and speci city of MTX skin testing as well as nonir ritating skin testing c oncentrations have not been established. However, the following concentrationshave been used for prick testing (10 mg/mL) and intradermaltesting (0.1 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL). 386Other skin testing concentrations with IDT (2.5 mg/mL), which were nonirri-tating in 2 healthy controls, have also been used in an adultpatient. 389Additional case reports in adults have demonstrated positive prick skin testing result.390,391In the pediatric pop- ulation, a recent retrospective review of a single-center expe-rience with MTX showed that only 1 of 4 patients testedpositive on skin testing. 386This may suggest immediate type I hypersensitivity as part of the pathogenesis in some patients. Management. For patients with MTX reactions, the man- agement should be individualized in the context of overall clin-ical picture after considering risks and bene ts of reintroduction. If the patient has a negative skin testing result and/or history of minor reaction, challenge may be considered. The challenge can be performed starting with 1/100th of the total dose. Patientswith severe reactions (especially involving vital sign changes, pharyngeal edema, respiratory and cardiovascular involvement, etc) should receive desensitization regardless of the skin testresult. Case reports have described prolonged infusion ranging from 6 to 27 hours. 392-394However, at some institutions, the current practice for both adults and children involves a desen- sitization protocol with 3 bags of different concentrations that areadministered via 12 steps, with the rst bag consisting of 1/100th of the total dose, the second bag 1/10th of the total dose, and thethird bag containing the remainder of the dose. A 16-step pro- tocol involving 4 bags has also been performed in cases with severe reactions. Each step involves doubling of the concentra-tions every 15 minutes until the last step (step 12) is reached. The premedications can include H 1and H 2antagonists in addition to Table XL ). General. Adverse reactions to cyclophosphamide (CYC) are most commonly due to drug toxicity. The major determinant is the cumulative dose received; toxicities are related to both dose and duration of exposure to this agent. Major toxicities associated with CYC are bone marrow suppression, increased susceptibilityto infection, gonadal toxicity leading to infertility, increased risk of hematologic and skin malignancies, cystitis, and bladder cancer. 395Less common adverse reactions are described in several case reports, and are dermatologic. One patient with systemic lupus erythematosus treated with CYC developed a neutrophilic myeloma (MM) a neutrophilic folliculitis.397 Type I hypersensitivity reactions to CYC are relatively rare, but case reports can be found in the literature. Vis-itsunthorn et al 398described a pediatric patient treated with CYC for systemic lupus erythematosus who developed urti- caria on the fth exposure to the agent. Skin testing result was negative, and the patient then underwent successful graded challenge.

Skin testing result was alsonegative, but on rechallenge, the patient again presented witha similar rash. He underwent rapid desensitization, which he tolerated without a reaction, and was able to receive a sub- sequent treatment 2 days after his desensitization via standardadministration. Diagnosis. Type I hypersensitivity reaction to CYC is diagnosed on the basis of clinical history with or without skin testing. Signs and symptoms consistent with IgE-medi- ated hypersensitivity, such as hives, flushing, angioedema, pruritus, wheezing, and hypotension occurring during orshortly after receiving a dose of CYC, are highly suggestive of a type I hypersensitivity reaction. Skin testing can be used to conrm the clinical history; provi ders perform percutaneous prick testing 10 mg/mL testing with 1 mg/mL (1:10) and 10 mg/mL (1:1). In the case report by Visitsunthorn et al, 398prick and intradermal testing was performed with 0.02 mL of the following dilutions of CYC: 1:100, 1:10, and 1:1. Rosas prick with 10 mg/mL and intradermal testing with 1 mg/ mL. In all cases, prick and intradermal tests with CYC werecompared with a histamine-positive control and a diluent-negative control, and results were determined on the basis of this comparison. Neither of these published studies included controls to determine optimal nonirritating skin testingconcentrations for CYC. Management. Patients with an equivocal history and negative skin testing result may be subjected to graded challenge. Vis- itsunthorn et al398described a successful graded challenge to CYC, in which the patient received antihistamine pretreatment and was challenged, with doubling of doses every 15 minutes; however, they did not include the number of doses received and quantity given with each dose. Patients with a convincing clinical history with or without a positive skin test result may undergo rapid desensitization. Pa- tients may be successfully desensitized using a standard 3-bag 12- step protocol, with premedication with H 1and H 2blockers (Table XLI ).272Briefly, bag 1 contains a solution diluted 1:100, bag 2 a solution diluted 1:10, and bag 3 an undiluted solution.The rate of infusion is then doubled every 15 minutes until athreshold dose is reached; the patients may then receive the remainder of the undiluted bag 3 at a nal rate of infusion of 80 mL/h. The protocol reported by Rosas et al 399used an initial dose of 0.12 mg CYC diluted 1:4000, doubled every 15 to 30 FIGURE 4. Approach to taxane reintroduction in patients with hypersensitivity reaction. Mild immediate hypersensitivity reactions present with symptoms that are limited to the skin (eg, flushing) or that involve a single organ/system and that are mild (eg, mild back pain). Moderate hypersensitivity reactions present with symptoms that involve at least 2 organs/systems (eg, flushing and dyspnea) but without a significant drop in blood pressure or in oxygen saturation. Severe hypersensitivity reactions present with symptoms thattypically involve at least 2 organs/systems and with a significant drop in blood pressure (systolic /C2090 mm Hg and/or syncope) and/or in oxygen saturation ( /C2092%). In patients with a hypersensitivity reaction with desensitization or challenge, premedication can be adjusted for the next procedure, which can be administered using either the same or a longer protocol. Patients in whom the hypersensitivityreaction does not recur can then be treated with a shorter desensitization protocol, challenge, or regular infusion according to the al-gorithm. T o ensure the patient 's tolerance, each procedure can be repeated several times before proceeding with a shorter desensitization protocol, challenge, or regular infusion.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT 8, NUMBER 9SBROYLES ET AL S47minutes until a 1500-mg dose was delivered, for a cumulative dose of 2500 mg. Doxorubicin (by Kathleen Lee-Sarwar, MD) General. Doxorubicin is an inhibitor of DNA and RNA syn- thesis that intercalates between DNA base pairs, inhibits topo- isomerase II, and leads to production of free radicals. Doxorubicin is available without liposomal encapsulation (trade name form (trade name Doxil). Liposomal encapsulation allows for preferential concentration in tumor tissue. The nonliposomal form of doxorubicin is very rarely associ- ated with hypersensitivity reactions. In to pegylated liposomal doxorubicin isapproximately 8%, with some series reporting up to a 25%incidence. 400Reactions usually occur during the rst cycle. The mechanism of hypersensitivity on rst exposure may be explained at least in part by complement activation, which hasbeen demonstrated in vivo during infusion of pegylated lipo- somal doxorubicin and may lead to mast cell activation. 400 Interestingly, in the setting of carboplatin hypersensitivity,combining carboplatin with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin appears to have a protective effect and is associated with reduced incidence of hypersensitivity reactions compared with carbopla-tin as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel. 401 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Typical clinical features include those of mast cell emediated reactions such as flushing, pruritus, urticaria, dyspnea, sense of doom, and hypo- tension. Macular eruption and chest pain or back pain may also occur.272Hypersensitivity reaction severity ranges from mild to life-threatening. Doxorubicin may also cause adverse effects that mimic, but are not, hypersensitivity reactions. Liposomal doxorubicin is associated with palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, also calledhand-foot syndrome, which is a relatively common dermatologic toxic reaction associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy that can limit the use of such drugs. De nitive prevention and treatment strategies for palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia have not yet beenestablished. This typically occurs in the rst 3 cycles of treat- ment. 402Other cutaneous adverse effects include diffuse intertrigo-like eruption, and radiation recalldermatitis. 403Acute cardiotoxicity is rare and may present with arrhythmias such as atrial brillation, acute heart failure, myocarditis, or acute myocardial infarction. Chronic cardiomy-opathy is a more common and dose-limiting adverse effect. Diagnosis. The ability to perform skin testing in the evalua- tion of doxorubicin hypersensitivity is limited by cutaneoustoxicity. 404Doxorubicin hypersensitivity is therefore generally diagnosed clinically, and there are no published skin testing protocols at this time. Management. Desensitization has been successfully per- formed in patients with hypersensitivity reactions to doxorubicinand is an option for management when there is no effective alternative treatment. 271In a report of 413 cases of rapid desensitization, desensitization to doxorubicin was successfully completed in a total of 29 patients. A 12-step rapid desensiti- zation protocol may be used in cases with mild or moderatesymptoms ( Table XLII ). 272In or hypotension, a 16-step rapid desensiti-zation protocol should be used for the patient 'srst lifetime desensitization. If this is tolerated, a 12-step rapid desensitizationprotocol may be considered for subsequent infusions. Standardpretreatment a H 1-receptor antagonist, with optional additional premedications tailored to the patient 's initial reaction. Pemetrexed (by Paige Wickner, MD) General. Pemetrexed is an antifolate agent approved for use in patients with lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma. The exact incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to pemetrexed is unknown. In phase III trials, 17% to 22% of patients receivingthis agent developed a rash. 405The literature vasculitis, angioedema, AGEP, and anaphylactic reactions. Diagnosis. The clinical symptoms should be closely evaluated and if IgE is suspected, skin testing and desensitization can beconsidered. If a more serious reaction occurred that is not felt to be IgE-mediated, alternative treatment options should be considered. Intradermal skin testing results with pemetrexed atdilutions of 1:10,000, 1:1,000, 1:100, and 1:10 have been However, more data are needed to determine optimal nonirritating skin test concentrations. Management. For patients with suspected IgE-mediated re- actions with no reasonable alternatives, desensitization has been successfully reported (Table XLIII). Lenalidomide (by Paige Wickner, MD) agent that is pri- marily used for the treatment of MM, myelodysplastic syndrome, and mantle cell lymphoma. The exact incidence of hypersensi- tivity reactions to lenalidomide is unknown. The literature re- ports rashes occurring in 29% to 43% of patients, depending onunderlying disease indication. A spectrum of rashes has beenreported, including swelling, SJS, erythema multiforme, neutrophlic predominant rashes, and urticaria. Timing of re- actions has been reported as both acute and delayed in onset. Diagnosis. Clinical symptoms should be reviewed, evaluated, and continued, or alternative treatment options discussed. Atpresent, there are no published nonirritating skin test concen- trations for lenalidomide. Management. There are case reports of desensitization to lenalidomide. An outpatient desensitization protocol used astarting dose of 2.5 mg and desensitized 5 patients to lenalido- mide without adverse events. A shortened version of the outpa-tient desensitization can be repeated if the rst desensitization has no adverse events ( Tables XLIV andXLV). There are pub- lished rapid desensitization protocols for typical IgE-mediatedsymptoms as well as non eIgE-mediated symptoms. 406Patients with evidence or suggestion of SJS/TEN or medication-inducedlaboratory abnormalities are not good candidates for paclitaxel (135-175 mg/m2) infused every 3 wk over 3 h (example \u00bc294 mg) Four-bag/16-step protocol Bag Volume per bag (mL) Concentration per bag (mg/mL) Amount of bag infused (mL) Dose infused per bag (mg) Solution 1 250 0.00118 9.38 0.011 Solution 2 250 0.0118 9.38 0.111 0.118 18.75 2.213 Solution 4 250 1.167 250 291.665 Step Solution Rate (mL/h) Time (min) Volume infused (mL) Dose infused per step (mg) Cumulative dose (mg) 1 1 2.5 15 0.625 0.001 0.001 2 1 5 15 1.25 0.001 0.002 3 1 10 15 2.5 0.003 0.005 4 1 20 15 5 0.006 0.011 5 2 2.5 15 0.625 0.007 0.018 6 2 5 15 1.25 0.015 0.033 7 2 10 15 2.5 0.030 0.063 8 2 20 15 5 0.059 0.122 9 3 5 15 1.25 0.148 0.270 10 3 10 15 2.5 0.295 0.565 11 3 20 15 5 0.590 1.155 12 3 40 15 10 1.18 2.335 13 4 10 15 2.5 2.917 5.252 14 4 20 15 5 5.834 11.086 15 4 40 15 10 11.667 22.753 16 \u00bc6.67 Three-bag/12-step protocolBag Volume (mL) per bag Concentration (mg/mL) per bag Amount of bag infused (mL) Dose infused per bag (mg) Solution 1 250 0.0118 9.38 0.111 Solution 2 250 0.118 18.75 2.213 Solution 3 250 1.167 250 291.676 Step Solution Rate (mL/h) Time (min) Volume infused (mL) Dose infused per step (mg) Cumulative dose (mg) 1 1 2.5 15 0.625 0.007 0.007 2 1 5 15 1.25 0.015 0.022 3 1 10 15 2.5 0.030 0.052 4 1 20 15 5 0.059 0.111 5 2 5 15 1.25 0.148 0.259 6 2 10 15 2.5 0.295 0.554 7 2 20 15 5 0.590 1.144 8 2 40 15 10 1.18 2.324 9 3 10 15 2.5 2.917 5.241 10 3 20 15 5 5.834 11.075 11 3 40 15 10 11.667 22.742 12 \u00bc5.67 Two-bag/8-step protocolBag Volume (mL) per bag Concentration (mg/mL) per bag Amount of bag infused (mL) Dose infused per bag (mg) Solution 1 250 0.118 18.75 2.213 Solution 2 250 1.167 250 291.787 Step Solution Rate (mL/h) Time (min) Volume infused (mL) Dose infused per step (mg) Cumulative dose (mg) 1 1 5 15 1.25 0.148 0.148 2 1 10 15 2.5 0.295 0.443 3 1 20 15 5 0.590 1.033 4 1 40 15 10 1.18 IMMUNOL Louisias, MD, Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug with antiangiogenic properties.407It is approved for use in erythema nodosum leprosum and MM, with off-label use in many con- ditions such as HIV apthous ulcers and graft-versus-host dis-ease. 408It is administered alone for erythema nodosum or in conjunction with dexamethasone for MM. Because of its knownsevere teratogenic effects it can be prescribed and dispensed onlyby prescribers and pharmacies enrolled in the THALOMIDREMS program in the United States. 409It is available as capsules in the United States. It is soluble at 25/C14C in dimethyl sulfoxide and sparingly soluble in water and ethanol. The incidence ofthalidomide hypersensitivity reactions ranges from 6.3% to 47.7% among several thalidomide clinical trials. 407 Major symptoms. Thalidomide hypersensitivity presents with delayed (usually within rst month of treatment) skin re- actions of varying severity.407However, in a retrospective review, skin reactions were seen more than 12 weeks after initiation with thalidomide or thalidomide analogs (lenalidomide, pomalido-mide), in the setting of dose escalation or steroid tapering. 410 Dry skin, pruritic maculopapular rash, morbilliform rash, diffuseerythematous eruptions, scaling have been described in the literature. 407,411Body distribution is variable but is reported to mostly affect the trunkand proximal limbs. 407 Diagnosis. There is no standardized skin testing or patch testing protocol available. Nucera et al412performed prick-by- prick testing with a solution made from a tablet dissolved insaline. However, because thalidomide (capsule) is soluble only indimethyl sulfoxide, which is a skin irritant, skin prick testing can be done only with thalidomide dissolved in saline in accordance with European Network of Drug Allergy/EAACI (ENDA/EAACI) guidelines. 79Nucera et al412also performed intradermal testing with thalidomide at a concentration of 0.04 mg/dL. Patchtesting was also done according to ENDA/EAACI and AmericanAcademy of Dermatology guidelines. Patches were applied to the interscapular area with commercially available adhesive anallergic gauze strips and assessed at 48 and 72 hours. 269,413Saline and histamine were used as negative and positive controls for alltesting, respectively; however, whether these concentrations arenonirritating was not established. Management. The challenge protocol given in Table XLVI is adapted from Nucera et al412who performed it in an ambulatory setting. The patient experienced a pruritic, erythematous rashafter completion of day 2. Symptoms improved with an anti-histamine. The desensitization protocol is also adapted fromNucera et al, 412who performed it over 5 days in a hospital setting (Table XLVII ). The same patient underwent desensiti- zation without adverse reaction and completed treatmentwithout any issues. Oral antihistamine was used as premedication. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (by Joyce Hsu, MD) Since the introduction of imatinib in 2001, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) family of therapeutics has continued to expand rapidly. Currently, there are 31 FDA-approved medications in this family, including (with targets) the treatment of numerous malignancies and myeloproliferative disorders, as well as hypereosinophilicsyndrome and aggressive systemic mastocytosis in the case of imatinib. As a family, they are associated with signi cant cutaneous and systemic side effects that are important to differentiate from true hypersensitivity.TABLE XXXIX.

It occurs generally in the rst 2 to 4 weeks of treat- ment. Oral dysesthesia and mucositis occurs with TKIs, partic-ularly sorafenib and sunitinib, may occur simultaneouslywith skin rash and hand-foot syndrome. 418Mucosal involvement may also include conjunctivitis with EGFR inhibitors and peri-orbital edema with imatinib. These symptoms can be dif cult to differentiate from systemic drug reactions, and skin biopsy can be helpful. 419 Diarrhea is also observed commonly with TKIs as a class. Several of the TKIs, such as lapatinib, sunitinib, and pazopanib,carry a black box warning for liver toxicity, but it occurs commonly with other TKIs including ge tinib.420Dose reduc- tion or drug discontinuation should be considered with hepa-totoxicity as well as severe and chronic diarrhea. 419 Desensitization protocols have been described for several TKIs. Imatinib. Ten patients with imatinib hypersensitivity who underwent subsequent desensitization were described by Nelsonet al 421in 2006. These patients had predominantly cutaneous initial reactions, though several had additional fever, blistering,edema, or diarrhea. One patient was skin tested by skin pricktesting at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/mL and intradermal testing at 0.001 mg/mL, 0.01 mg/mL, and 0.1 mg/mL. Erythema was reported on intradermal testing. Of these 10 patients who completed a 4-hour rapid oral desensitization ( Table XLVIII ), 8 quently able to tolerate daily imatinib without hypersensitivitysymptoms. The other 2 patients developed rash hours to daysafter desensitization. Subsequently, Paolo 422published a case report describing slow oral desensitization to imatinib over 23 days for a patientwho developed eosinophilic dermatitis after 6 weeks(Table XLIX ).

The patient ini tially failed rapid desensiti- zation twice, but was able to tole rate imatinib after slow oral desensitization ( Table about 10% of pa- tients, and is generally mild to moderate in severity. Hyper-sensitivity reactions are rare, but reported. Sanchez-Lopezet al 423described a patient presenting with urticaria and facial edema for more than 40 days after initiation of treatment. Skin testing was performed with crizotinib capsules suspended in water (skin prick 25 mg/mL, intradermal testing 0.025 mg/mLand 0.25 mg/mL) and the result was negative. Five normal controls also had negative results to skin testing with this regimen. The patient was premedicated with intramusculardexchlorpheniramine 5 mg and methylprednisolone 40 mg, and the 5-step oral desensitization was performed with 30-minute intervals and 120 minutes of observation on completion (Table L). The patient subsequently tolerated crizotinib without hypersensitivity symptoms. In 2014, Awad et al 424also described 2 patients with more rapid-onset crizotinib hypersensitivity, one with immediate ur-ticaria and edema and the other with a delayed maculopapular rash. Patients were premedicated 1 hour and 12 hours before desensitization with 10 mg of loratadine and 10 mg of cetirizine.Both patients were successfully desensitized to crizotinib using a 12-step rapid desensitization protocol, with 15-minute intervals between steps (Table LI ). Sorafenib. Sorafenib is more commonly associated with hand- foot skin reaction and other symptoms related to toxicity, but itcan rarely ( <1%) trigger allergic symptoms, including urticaria. In 2008, Bauer et al 425described a patient who developed a pruritic generalized maculopapular rash after 2 weeks of sorafenibtherapy. The rash resolved with discontinuation of sorafenib andtreatment with oral antihistamines and topical steroids.

Generalized hypersensitivity reactions are rare with sunitinib. Bar-Sela et al427described a patient presenting with onset of generalized acute urticaria and facial edema 4 days after starting sunitinib. The patient was desensitized 1 week afterresolution of his symptoms, with oral premedications includingprednisone 20 mg and promethazine 25 mg given 1 hour before initiation. Each of the 10 steps was carried out in 1-hour in- tervals, and he was observed overnight before discharge(Table LIII). The patient required desensitization with this protocol twice, because of a treatment pause. A mild pruritic rashdeveloped after the rst desensitization, but resolved with oral steroid and antihistamine, and he was able to continue the medication. The second desensitization was well tolerated, and he subsequently was continued on sunitinib treatment withouthypersensitivity reactions.Alectinib. In one report, a patient developed a skin rash affecting the arms and trunk starting 10 days after initiation ofalectinib. 428Skin biopsy was notable for perivascular in neutrophils, and lymphocytes in the upper dermis. The rash resolved completely after discontinuation of alectinib, and the patient underwent successful oral desensitization using aprotocol that was administered over 9 days (Table LIV). BIOLOGICALS Rituximab (by Patrick Brennan, MD, is a chimeric mouse-human mAb directed against CD20, an abundant surface receptor found on B lym- phocytes. The incidence of clinically signi cant reactions to rit- uximab is very high, and varies widely with the indication fortreatment. Most studies have reported reaction rates during theinitial infusion ranging from 25% to more than 75%. 429-433The incidence of reactions during subsequent infusions is muchlower. 430,432It should be noted, however, that severe infusion reactions can also occur only after several exposures, or onreexposure after a long hiatus. Most infusion reactions respond to symptomatic treatment and/or lowering of the infusion rate, and most reactions can be managed by the supervising oncologist orrheumatologist. Only a fraction of infusion reactions to ritux- imab warrant evaluation and treatment by an allergy specialist. Because of the high incidence of reactions, however, identifyingcases that are appropriate for referral can be challenging. An al- lergist 's evaluation is recommended for patients who have experienced reactions that are consistent with immediate-type hypersensitivity, severe reactions, repeated reactions, or progres- sive reactions with multiple medication administrations. Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Common infu- sion reactions can involve symptoms rituximab for lymphoid malignancy also often pre-cipitates malaise, fever, and chills, possibly secondary to tumor lysis. In autoimmune diseases, headache, nausea, and diarrhea have been commonly reported. The allergy specialist should alsobe aware of the possibility for serious, nonimmediate adverse reactions including serum sickness, SJS, TEN, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, shock, and pulmonary toxicity. 434 Diagnosis. Reactions to rituximab can be IgE-mediated. In patients with suspected rituximab hypersensitivity referred to anacademic allergy practice, skin testing result for rituximab wasreported as positive in 6 of 9 patients tested, suggesting that at least some reactions to rituximab may be IgE-mediated. 435A case report has more thoroughly demonstrated the presence of anti- rituximab IgE in a patient who had experienced progressivehypersensitivity symptoms after rituximab exposure. 436The use of a BAT has also been reported for reactions to rituximab, butfurther study is required before this modality can be used inclinical practice. 437As a practical approach, skin testing to rit- uximab using 10 mg/mL epicutaneously, followed by mg/mL, and 1 mg/mL intradermally, is recommended.It should be noted that systematic testing of nonirritating con- centrations for most mAbs has not been reported. A positive skin test result after a reaction consistent with immediate hypersen-sitivity should be interpreted as con rmation of allergy.TABLE XLIV.

In addition, there may be non eIgE- mediated reactions to rituximab infusion that involve mast cell degranulation and mediators of allergic disease, and these re- actions would also be amenable to the management approachesdescribed herein. Therefore, a careful history of the reaction(s) experienced remains a valuable diagnostic tool. Management. Although not standardized, both antihista- mines and systemic glucocorticoids are routinely used as ritux- imab premedications for both oncologic and autoimmuneindications. If a reaction occurs, the infusion should be stopped, and symptoms treated. For nonanaphylactic reactions, after symptoms have resolved, the infusion can generally be restartedat a slower rate. Because most infusion reactions occur during the rst exposure and are not seen with subsequent exposures, standard reinfusion after a rst-exposure infusion reaction is reasonable in the absence of a life-threatening reaction.In a retrospective review of 67 patients who reacted to rit- uximab, 63% of reactions occurred during the rst exposure; of these, 88% were grade 1 or 2. 438Of these patients, 88% were rechallenged with rituximab on the same day, and those with a grade 1 reaction were able to complete the infusion. However, all4 patients with a grade 3 reaction had a reaction during rechal- lenge. After a grade 2 reaction, 84% tolerated same-day chal- lenge, but 5 patients had a subsequent mild reaction. For patients referred for evaluation by an allergist, skin testing can be useful in guiding management. 439,440If skin testing result is negative after a mild to moderate reaction that was consistentwith immediate hypersensitivity, a graded dose challenge can be considered; 1/100 and 1/10 dose challenges before the full dose, with a 1-hour interval, are recommended. For patients withpositive skin testing result, or for those with negative skin testresults who experienced severe reactions consistent with imme- diate hypersensitivity, rapid desensitization to rituximab with mAbs is often urgentand time-sensitive, making the process of evaluation with skin testing dif cult because of time limitations. When treatment options are limited, desensitization should be considered to allow for the continued use of these drugs in patients who have a re- action consistent with immediate hypersensitivity. Rapid desen- sitization has been a highly successful strategy for preventingimmediate-type hypersensitivity reactions to rituximab and othermAbs. 440In 2 case series of 14 and 7 adult patients with clinical histories consistent with rituximab hypersensitivity, all weresuccessfully desensitized. 435,441Successful desensitization has subsequently been reported with multiple protocols.442A 12- step protocol for desensitization of adults is recommended for theinitial desensitization (Table LV ). Successful rapid desensitization to rituximab and other mAbs has also been reported in pediatric populations. 443-445In a pe- diatric case series, rituximab desensitization was successfully usedin 3 patients and a total of 17 infusions. 444For an adolescentTABLE XLVI.

For these patients, the desensitization protocol was successfullyadapted to adjust for the patients 'weight, with rate increases of not more than approximately 0.5 mg/kg/h, and with the nal infusion rate not exceeding 2 mg/kg/h. Cetuximab (by Timothy Kyin, IgG 1mAb against EGFR approved in 2005 for use in the United States for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. According to the product in-formation, 3% of patients will experience a severe allergic reac- tion, with 90% of these reactions occurring on rst exposure. Symptoms can include dif culty breathing, low blood pressure, shock, loss of consciousness, and/or heart attack. Since its release, it has become evident that the rate of rst- exposure hypersensitivity reaction is higher than previously described, with a regional preference for the southeastern UnitedStates. A 2007 review of patients receiving treatment with cetuximab at major centers in North Carolina and Tennessee showed that a grade 3 to 4 hypersensitivity reaction occurred in19 (22%) of 88 patients. 446Another multicenter study demonstrated that most patients who experienced a hypersensi-tivity reaction had preformed IgE to cetuximab without anyprevious exposure. The antibody was speci c for galactose- a-1,3-galactose, which is present in the Fab portion of the cetuximabheavy chain. 447Unlike most mAbs, cetuximab is generated in a mouse cell line (SP2/0), which expresses the gene for a-1,3- galactosyltransferase. Investigation of this regional variation inreaction rates led to the discovery that tick bites are the cause of IgE production to galactose- a-1,3-galactose.448This antibody has also been linked to delayed red meat anaphylaxis.449Some have suggested that evaluation of preexisting anticetuximab IgEcould be used as a screening tool for pretreatment risk stratication. 450 Current manufacturer guidelines recommend discontinuation of cetuximab after a severe allergic reaction, but there have beenreports of successful desensitizations to this medication. The rst such report was in 2009 in a 60-year-old woman with metastaticbreast cancer who had hypotension, tachycardia, and oxygen desaturation after receiving only 28 mg of a planned 843-mg dose during her rst exposure. 451She was later found to have preexisting IgE to cetuximab. She was subsequently able to un- dergo a complete desensitization with a 5-bag, 20-step protocol. At Brigham and Women' s Hospital, in conjunction with the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, a modi ed rapid desensitization has been used (unpublished data). This was in a 49-year-oldwoman with rst-exposure hypersensitivity, involving urticaria, nausea, vomiting, and throat-closing sensation, and who had apositive intradermal skin test result at 1:10 dilution. A modi ed 1-bag, 5-step protocol with manipulation of the infusion rate wasused for desensitization in this patient ( Table LVII ). Because of the proprietary nature of the cetuximab solution, there was concern about compound stability if the cetuximab was diluted with standard buffers. She has thus far completed 8 de-sensitizations of cetuximab with this protocol without complications. Therefore, based on these experiences, it seems reasonable that desensitization is a viable option for this medication in theappropriate clinical setting. Other mAbs (by Matthieu Picard, MD) TNF-ainhibitors General. TNF- ainhibitors are used for the treatment of in- flammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing persensitivity reactions to in fliximab : Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to in fliximab occur in about 10% of patients and present with features that can suggest mast cell/basophil activa- tion ( flushing, pruritus, dyspnea, dizziness/hypotension) as with nonspeci c symptoms (headache, increased blood pres- sure, chest and back pain, fever, and chills).435,445,457-459Im- mediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur with the rst exposure but their incidence peaks around the seventh infusion.435,457 Injection-site reactions and systemic reactions to certolizumab, adalimumab, golimumab, and etanercept : Injection-site reactions occur in about 20% of patients treated with adalimumab oretanercept and in 2% to 6% of certolizu- mab or golimumab. 460,461Reactions to etanercept occur in median on the fourth injection, have their onset 1 to 2 days after injection, last 2 to 3 days, and may be accompanied by recallTABLE XLVII.

In patients with a negative skin test result, an IgG-mediated mechanism may be responsible for the hypersensitivity reaction. Patients with anti-infliximab IgGs are at increased risk (relative risk varies from 2.4 to 4.0) of immediate hypersensitivity reactions compared withpatients without such antibodies. 472,473TABLE XLVIII.

The risk of a recurrent reaction with subsequent exposures isaround 33% on the rst reexposure and progressively decreases thereafter. 475Therefore, in patients who tolerate desensitization well, it may be reasonable to progressively shorten desensitizationprotocols and eventually proceed to a challenge procedure exceptin those with an IgE-mediated allergy (Figure 6 ). 476 Anti-in fliximab antibodies do patients who develop anti-in fliximab anti- bodies are more prone to develop antiadalimumab antibodiesand have a higher treatment failure rate with adalimumab. 461 Also, rare cases of patients with immediate hypersensitivity re-action to in fliximab have been described who also reacted to adalimumab (injection-site reaction or serum sickness elike re- actions). 469,478Despite these caveats, switching to adalimumab after a hypersensitivity reaction to in fliximab etanercept, adalimumab, golimu- mab, or certolizumab usually treated with an oral anti-histamine, topical corticosteroids, and analgesics. 460 Desensitization could be considered for those with importantinjection-site reactions or with systemic reactions (Table LX ). 462 Desensitization is not a safe method of preventing non- immediate hypersensitivity reactions to TNF- ainhibitors, but the optimal approach remains unclear. Switching to anotherTNF- ainhibitor has not been adequately studied, though some authors have reported that reexposure to the suspected culprit drug may not necessarily lead to a recurrent reaction.465,479 Ofatumumab and obinutuzumab. Ofatumumab and obinutuzumab target CD20 and are used in the treatment of B- cell malignancies.480-482Immediate hypersensitivity reactions,thought to be caused by a cytokine release syndrome, occur inmore than 50% of patients treated with 1 of these mAbs on rst exposure. 481,483,484Although the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions rapidly decreases with subsequent infusions, severereactions that led to drug discontinuation and even fatal hy- persensitivity reactions, in the case of ofatumumab, have been reported. 481,483,485Skin testing to these mAbs has not been studied. The approach used for hypersensitivity reactions to rituximab can be applied to these agents because at least 2 pa- tients were in thetreatment of CD30 \u00felymphomas.486Several cases of anaphylaxis have been reported, which usually occurred after at least 1 un-eventful exposure. 487-489Skin testing to brentuximab vedotin could help identify patients with an IgE-mediated allergy.474 Desensitization appears to be the method of choice for reexposurein patients with anaphylaxis ( Table LIX a humanized mAb against the human EGFR 2 used in the treatment of breast cancer.490 Sixteen percent to 40% of patients experience an immediatehypersensitivity reaction during their rst exposure to trastuzu- mab, with clinical features suggestive of a cytokine release syn-drome. 491,492Most of these patients tolerate future infusions after premedication with an antihistamine and a corticoste-roid. 490-492Patients who experience an immediate reaction after tolerating several infusions of trastuzumab arelikely to have developed an reaction to the mAb.Skin testing ( Table LVIII ) can be useful to identify those pa- tients. 435,470Although most patients with a mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction due to cytokine release will toleratereexposure through a standard reinfusion, desensitization (Table LIX ) should be considered for those with a severe cyto- kine release reaction or with an IgE-mediated reaction (Figure 6 ). 435,470,474,491,492Papulopustular acneiform skin eruptions have been reported in some patients treated with trastuzumab.

Bevacizumab is a humanized mAb used in the treatment of many types of cancer that targets vascular endo-thelial growth factor. 498Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to bevacizumab occur in less than 3% of patients and are usuallymild. 499Of the rare patients with an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, most tolerate subsequent exposures with premedicationTABLE LI.

Omalizumab is a mAb that binds free IgE antibodies.504It is administered subcutaneously and is used in the treatment of moderate to severe allergic asthma andchronic idiopathic urticaria. 504Anaphylaxis to omalizumab is rare and is estimated to occur in 0.1% to 0.2% of patients.505A history of anaphylaxis, regardless of the cause, was recentlyshown to increase the risk of developing anaphylaxis to omali- zumab to 0.6%. 506More than half the cases of anaphylaxis to omalizumab occur less than 1 hour after medication adminis- tration. However, delayed reactions ( >24 hours after the injec- tion) and a protracted course, with symptoms progressively developing over the course of several hours, have been re- ported.506,507Two patients with symptom onset more than 24 hours after the injection were rechallenged and both had recur- rent reactions, strengthening the causality of omalizumab in these reactions.507The mechanism of immediate hypersensitivity re- actions to omalizumab remains elusive.

Adverse reactions to insulin have decreased in fre- quency since the introduction of synthetic recombinant DNA human insulin analogues, but recombinant humanized insulincan still be associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Prevalenceof suspected insulin allergy has been reported in as few than 3% of patients annually. 512Pediatric and adult patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes may be affected.

Short-acting insulin preparations are believed to be the least frequently associated with sensitivity because therapidity of absorption is thought to decrease immune exposure. Allergic sensitization may also occur because of insulin additives or materials used to administer insulin injections orinfusions. Insulin reactions can pose signi cant challenges for diabetic patients, who may have no alternatives to lifelong insulin therapy.Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Adverse reactions to insulin immediate-type (IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity reactions (type I, or IgE- mediated) are the most commonly reported insulin reactions.

Localized symptoms may be mostprominent near the site of the insulin injection or infusion. Systemic reactions are rare, but anaphylaxis to insulin has been reported even with recombinant insulin preparations. 513-515 Immediate-type insulin allergy frequently occurs within several weeks after initiation of insulin therapy or after restarting ther- apy, but it can also develop after years of treatment. Symptoms of insulin reactions may also be delayed in pre- sentation. In the case of immune complex emediated (type III) reactions, subcutaneous nodules may develop at the injection siteafter 2 to 6 hours, with later symptoms of serum sickness including pruritic rash, joint pains, fatigue, and elevated in- flammatory markers. 516Delayed-type hypersensitivity (type IV) reactions to insulin detemir have also been reported, withsymptoms of prolonged induration, pain, warmth, and swelling at the injection site, or, in 1 case report, leukoclastic vascu- litis. 517,518Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions may also occur in response to components of insulin preparations, such as protamine or metacresol or from components of equipment used for insulin administration, such as adhesives or tubing.519,520 Insulin resistance and lipoatrophy at injection sites were re- ported in patients receiving bovine or porcine insulin, and werelinked to circulating antibodies to insulin. 521Transition to re- combinant human insulins has eliminated many impuritiesassociated with animal insulin preparations, and such associatedside effects are now rare. Diagnosis. A careful history is vital in the evaluation for a potential insulin reaction. Other causes of symptoms must beexcluded. In a retrospective study, 59% of suspected cases ofinsulin \"allergy \"did not have an allergic cause. 522Patients with diabetes mellitus have increased incidence of other autoimmunediseases, which should also be considered on the differentialdiagnosis. Chronic urticaria, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, vascu- litis, and other systemic autoimmune diseases may present with rash or other skin manifestations. Timing and characteristics of associated symptoms should be considered to determine the likely type of reaction. Allergic re-actions to insulin can occur to the insulin itself; to preservativesand solvents such as metacresol, phenol, or sodium phosphate; orto insulin additives such as protamine or zinc, which help slow insulin absorption. 523-526In addition, hypersensitivity reactions have been reported to injection or infusion pump equipment, latex, nickel, epoxy resin, and local disinfectants.527,528There- fore, consideration must also be given to components of theinsulin preparation being used, as well as to components ofequipment used for infusion (syringes, needles, infusion pump tubing, adhesives, etc), latex in this equipment or in the stopper of insulin vials, and possible reactions to alcohol or disinfectantwipes.TABLE LVI.

Skin testing for the insulin preparations used, alternative in- sulin preparations, and additives may help distinguish the speci c allergenic component or components (Table LXIII). Skin testing for short-acting insulins (Table LXIV), which may be less aller- genic, may be considered for patients with possible allergicsymptoms to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, or pa- tients with allergy to other forms of insulin for whom this therapy may be considered. Positive insulin skin testing results have been reported in patients receiving insulin without allergic symptoms, so skin testresults must be correlated with clinical symptoms. 522It may be helpful to include alternative insulin preparations in skin testing, to identify preparations to which a patient may not be sensitized. Testing should also include additives present in each formulationof interest. Sterile diluent vials (eg, Lily Sterile Diluent 1-ND800) are commonly used for injection teaching and diluting insulin. These contain additives such as metacresol and glycerin at concentrations equivalent to insulin preparations, so they maybe helpful in skin testing. In the case of a suspected reaction to a long-acting insulin preparation containing protamine, sensitization to protamineshould also be excluded. Testing result should be interpreted with care, because a signi cant percentage of diabetic patients who have received neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin without history of adverse reaction may have positive skin testing resultand/or serum-speci c IgE to protamine. 530,531Skin prick testing for protamine may be performed at a dilution matching theapproximate concentrations contained in neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin mg/mL, a 30-fold dilution of stock protamine, 10 mg/mL).532 If the insulin preparation has a stopper containing latex, skin and/ or blood testing for latex allergy may also be included in the evalu- ation. However, many preparations of insulin are now latex-free. Serum sickness etype reactions to insulin are relatively rare, and have been diagnosed primarily on the basis of clinical symptoms. Skin biopsy has shown perivascular lymphocytic inltrate in delayed-type hy- persensitivity to insulin, intradermal skin testing result to insulin has been reported to be positive in some patients after 24 or 48 hours.522,532Patch testing can also been performed for potential contact dermatitis reactions to nickel in subcutaneous infusion needles, acrylates in infusion catheters, adhesives in butter fly catheters, or other additives such as parabens, phenol, and isophane. If timing and location of symptoms are insuf cient to establish the diagnosis, skin biopsy may be helpful to rule out systemicdermatologic conditions such as vasculitis, psoriasis, or eczema. Management. Initial management of suspected allergic re- actions to insulin may include antihistamines and/corticoste-roids, particularly for local reactions. Changing therapy may be considered. Patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin allergy can have a trial of conventional oralhypoglycemic medications.

In the case of immediate-type reactions, if switching insulin preparations is not feasible or alternative therapies do not adequately control blood sugar levels, immunotherapy in theform of desensitization may be considered. Established desensi- tization protocols may administer insulin as increasing in- crements of subcutaneous doses, continuous subcutaneousinfusions delivered by insulin pumps, or (rarely) by intravenousinfusion, with either regular insulin forms or recombinant in-sulin. 534-537Insulin desensitization has been performed starting with subcutaneous infusion at 1 /C210/C03units and doubling every 15 to 20 minutes, up to a dose of 1 unit, then switching tocontinuous infusion through the insulin pump to maintaindesensitization. Transition from regular insulin to longer-acting forms of insulin can also be attempted in desensitization (Table LXV ).

Largelocal reactions may respond to antihistamines or, if needed, localinjections of steroids (100 mg dexamethasone diluted in 100 units insulin and used for subcutaneous injections or continuous infusion with insulin pump). Topical cromolyn sodium may alsobe compounded as a lotion or cream for local application. If local injections are not suf cient to control symptoms, desensitization can also be attempted. For treatment of delayed reactions, change in insulin preparations may also be bene cial. For type III re- actions, successful treatment with MTX, 518colchicine, and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP),539as well as plasmapheresis,540have been reported. Conclusions. Insulin allergy is a rare, but serious condition. Patients may be sensitized to insulin itself, to additives in insulinpreparations, or to equipment used to administer subcutaneousdoses. Evaluation begins with a history and close examination ofadditives contained in the form of insulin administered(Table LXIII). Skin testing with insulin and additives may be helpful to evaluate immediate-type reactions, and patch testingmay be useful for delayed reactions. The rst steps in manage- ment are to identify potential alternative insulin forms and treat symptoms with antihistamine and steroids if indicated. Large local reactions may bene t from local steroid injection and topical cromolyn preparation, and may improve over time. If initial strategies are not successful in preventing reactions, sub- cutaneous desensitization may be attempted. Progestogens including progesterone (by Dinah Foer, MD, Andrew MacGinnitie, MD, PhD, and Kathleen M. Buchheit, MD) General. Progesterone is an endogenous steroid hormone involved in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Synthetic pro- gesterone preparations known as progestins are also used ascontraception and hormone replacement, particularly in the setting of in vitro fertilization. Adverse reactions to both endogenous progesterone and exogenous progestins have been documented and were initially termed autoimmune progesterone FIGURE 6. Suggested algorithm for the management of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to mAbs. Reactions due to cytokine release syndrome typically occur on the first administration and wane rapidly with subsequent exposures. Symptoms usually include fever, chills, rigors, and dyspnea but flushing, dizziness/hypotension, and gastrointestinal symptoms can also be seen. IgE-mediated and IgG-mediated reactions generally occur after at least 1 uneventful administration although IgE-mediated reactions have been described on first exposure to cetuximab due to preformed IgEs. IgG-mediated reactions have not been clearly demonstrated in humans, but they could account forreactions similar to IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions but in which IgE antibodies cannot be demonstrated (eg, skin testing result is negative). Grade 1 immediate hypersensitivity reactions present with symptoms that are limited to the skin (eg, flushing) or that involve a single organ/system and that are mild (eg, mild back pain). Grade 2 hypersensitivity reactions present with symptoms that involve at least2 organs/systems (eg, flushing and dyspnea) but without a significant drop in blood pressure or in oxygen saturation. Grade 3 hyper-sensitivity reactions present with symptoms that typically involve at least 2 organs/systems and with a significant drop in blood pressure (systolic /C2090 mm Hg and/or syncope) and/or in oxygen saturation ( /C2092%). Modified with permission from Picard et ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT VOLUME 8, NUMBER 9SBROYLES ET AL S63dermatitis, but more recently, the terminology has been changed to progestogen hypersensitivity (PH) to more accurately re flect the pathobiology.541,542Hypersensitivity reactions to progester- one are rare, with just over 100 cases reported, but with theincreased use of exogenous progestogens, PH has become more frequently described. 543Clinical presentation. Onset of symptoms can occur in women any time between menarche and menopause. Endoge- nously triggered presentations are often cyclical, because pro-gesterone levels peak approximately 1 week before the onset ofmenses. 544In cases of PH associated with exogenous progester- one, the timing of symptoms should correlate with progestinTABLE LX.

Use of high-dose progestogens in women undergoing in vitro fertilization may predispose them to the development of PH and make it dif cult for patients to undergo fertility treat- ment.543Therefore, a careful history of both symptom timing and exposures is critical to making the diagnosis of PH. Major symptoms. PH is a multisystem disorder. It is char- acterized by skin angioedema. 545-547Non- dermatologic hypersensitivity symptoms have also been described, including asthma and anaphylaxis.546,548Both non- dermatologic and dermatologic manifestations have been described in the same patient.546 Diagnosis. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical symptoms correlating with progestogen exposure. Skin testing for PH maybe used in the appropriate clinical context to con rm possible cases of PH. The results must be interpreted with cautionbecause the sensitivity and speci city are unknown and false- positive reactions frequently occur. 542This may be due to theprogesterone vehicle because it is not water soluble and must bedissolved in an oil- or ethanol-based diluent. Therefore, the skintesting diluent should be included as a control in addition to appropriate saline (negative) and histamine (positive) controls. Table LXVI lists a published skin testing protocol. An uncon- vincing history, regardless of skin test result, should prompt the clinician to consider a broader differential diagnosis. Because approximately half of patients with PH have positive skin testresults and there are concerns about false-positive testing results, response of symptoms to administration of a gonadotrophin- releasing hormone agonist has been proposed as an alternativediagnostic strategy, at least for those with symptoms fromendogenous exposure. 542,549 Management. Management of PH varies widely on the basis of patient 's symptoms and long-term goals. First-line treatment includes symptom management with antihistamines and/or oral or topical steroids as appropriate. In patients who do not expe- rience relief with symptomatic therapies, additional therapiessuch as oral contraceptive pills, tamoxifen, attenuated androgens,gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, and omalizumab can be considered. 550-553However, these therapies may have long- term adverse side effects limiting patient tolerance. In extreme cases of endogenously triggered PH, oophorectomy remains a curative option.554 Progesterone desensitization has been demonstrated as a safe and ef cacious option for PH management. Consideration must be given to premedication, trained staff, and clinical settings before initiating desensitization.543Indications for desensitiza- tion include need for high-dose progesterone therapy for fertilityTABLE LXIV.

For women undergoing in vitro fertilization, intravaginal and intramuscular desensitization has been used (Table LXVII ,Aand B).542,543 These cases are often managed in conjunction with a repro- ductive endocrinologist to optimize desensitization timing. Slow oral desensitization has been proposed for patients with derma- titis refractory to standard therapies ( Table LXVII ,C).542Sub- sequently, patients must continuously cycle on an oral contraceptive to maintain a steady state of progesterone to avoid resensitization. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) (by Elena Crestani, MD) General. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is a mixture of small polypeptides approved by the FDA as a rst-line disease-modi- fying agent in the treatment of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, given its ability to decrease the frequency of relapse and the progression of disability in affected in- dividuals.555It is administered as a 1-mL subcutaneous injection, either daily (20 mg/mL) or 3 times per week (40 mg/mL). Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Immediate in- jection-site reactions are very common, occurring in up to60% of the patients, and present with erythema, edema, and pruritus.556These reactions are thought to be due to direct mast cell activation at the site of injection causing the release of histamine and other mediators. Other local re-actions have also been described in the literature, thought to be caused by either direct drug toxicity (skin necrosis, lobular panniculitis) or immunomodulation (erythemanodosum, an immediate postinjection systemic reactioncharacterized by various combinations of flushing, hives, chest pain, anxiety, subjective sensation of dyspnea, and throat constriction. These reactions can develop at any time during treatment with glatiramer acetate, even after pro-longed use, and their severity usually prompts discontinua-tion of treatment, which otherwise offers a relatively benign side-effect pro le. This can be detrimental, especially for those patients who may not be candidates for other treat- ments. Although some of these reactions may represent true IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, other immediate\u2014and occa- sionally delayed \u2014cases are associated with negative allergy testing and are likely due to alternative immunologic mechanisms. 561,564-567TABLE LXVII.

Skin prick testing is performed using the full concentration of 20 mg/mL of glatiramer acetate (which is negative in nonexposed controls). If prick testing result isnegative, intradermal testing is performed using 0.00002 mg/mL(1:1,000,000 dilution), and if still negative, 0.0002 mg/mL (1:100,000 dilution), which is the highest nonirritating con- centration reported in a study. 568Previous reports indicated a high rate of false-positive reactions in control subjects when higher concentrations were used. Also, each 20-mg vial of gla- tiramer acetate contains 40 mg of mannitol, which is an irritantthat could at least in part be responsible for the high frequency of nonspeci c reactions reported. 569,570Speci c IgE to glatiramer acetate have been measured via ELISA in a few patients and levels were found to be elevated in most, though not all, patients withpositive skin testing result.567,569These determinations were performed on a research basis, because speci c IgE testing is not available commercially. Finally, BAT was reported in a series of 3patients with systemic reactions and positive skin testing result,and the result was positive in 2 of them. Overall, though gla- tiramer acetate skin testing has not been validated, it appears to be the most useful diagnostic tool to assist in the evaluation andmanagement of patients with a history of reactions to glatiramer acetate to determine whether an IgE-mediated mechanism may be involved; this could help in making a decision about futuredesensitization if indicated.

A report in 2010 described a desensitization protocol that was successfully applied to 6 adult patients with a history of both immediate or delayed systemic reactions and positive skin testing result.571 Also, a modi ed, more gradual version of the protocol, which included premedication with steroids and antihistamines, was successfully carried out to desensitize another adult patient.572A similar protocol was applied to a 51-year-old woman with generalized urticarial and positive skin testing result to glatiramer acetate.569The youngest patient ever documented to undergo successful desensitization was a 14-year-old girl who experienced a severe systemic reaction and was found to have positive skin testing result; she was successfully desensitized to the full dose of 20 mg of glatiramer acetate (10 mg every 12 hours) and waseventually transitioned to daily injections (20 mg daily) with no further adverse reactions 568(Table LXVIII ). The same protocol has been successfully used to desensitize another pediatric pa- tient, and doctors were able to switch the patient to daily dosingwithin 24 hours of desensitization. H 1and H 2blockers, anti- leukotriene, or leukotriene receptor antagonists may be used forpretreatment and/or treatment of breakthrough reactions. Imiglucerase (Cerezyme) (by Joseph Zhou, MD, PhD) General. Imiglucerase (Cerezyme) is a highly puri ed human enzyme used for long-term enzyme replacement therapy for type 1 Gaucher disease. Up to 15% of patients may experience adverse reactions.573Reported adverse events include gastroin- testinal irritation (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea), nonspeci c constitutional symptoms (fatigue, fever, headache, chills, rash, and backache), and tachycardia. Approximately 15% of patients have developed IgG antibodies, and although more than 90% of these patients tolerated the infusion for at least 24to 36 months, almost half of these antibody-positive patients later experienced symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity. 574,575 In general, hypersensitivity reactions to imiglucerase intravenous infusion have been reported in approximately 13.8% of patients. IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions caused by imiglucerase are not common, and anaphylaxis to imiglucerase infusion is rare(reported in <1% of patients). 576,577Given the detrimental consequence of anaphylaxis, patients with symptoms suggesting hypersensitivity reaction to imiglu-cerase need to be evaluated carefully and managed accordingly.Skin testing and graded challenge can be used to evaluate imi- glucerase hypersensitivity. Desensitization for continued admin- istration of imiglucerase can be considered in patients who havean established diagnosis of imiglucerase hypersensitivity without appropriate alternative therapy. Evaluation. The positive and negative predictive value of imiglucerase skin test is unknown due to limited data; therefore, skin testing is not recommended as a routine procedure. How-ever, if the clinical symptoms associated with imiglucerase in- fusions suggest possible IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, skin testing and/or graded challenge with imiglucerase solution can beconsidered. Skin testing is recommended only for those patients who experience moderate or severe recurrent imiglucerase infusion eassociated reactions and the reactions are suggestive of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity such as persistent symptoms of bronchospasm, hypotension, and/or urticaria. Imiglucerase is reconstituted at the concentration of 200 units in 5 mL of sterile water to make a 40 units/mL solution. This concentration can be used for skin prick testing. For intradermal testing, 10-fold serial dilutions can be made with 0.9% sterile saline, and the highest nonirritating concentration for intrader-mal testing is 4 units/mL. 573Provider discretion can be used regarding the least concentrated dilution at which to start testing. For patients who experience mild adverse reactions to imi- glucerase infusion that are not consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction, imiglucerase may be delivered with 2- or 3-step graded challenge protocols depending on the severity of the adversereaction. If a 3-step protocol is used, 1% of the total therapeuticdose can be infused over 1 hour as the rst step. If there are no adverse reactions at the end of the infusion, the infusion rate canbe increased so that 10% of the total dose is delivered over1 hour. The rest of the therapeutic dose (90%) can be given at the regular rate if the patient successfully tolerates the rst 2 steps. If no adverse events are noted at the end of the third-step infusion, the patient is not likely to have imiglucerase allergy, and the challenge is not needed in the future unless the patient de- velops new reactions that may suggest hypersensitivity. Management. Desensitization is recommended for patients who have hypersensitivity react ions to imiglucerase and have no alternative treatment. An example protocol could include 5 bags (from 1 unit/mL to 0.0001 unit/mL) with 10 steps each to deliver roughly 140 units of imiglucerase in 5 hours. Then another 4-step infusion protocol can be used to achieve the regular infusion rate of 100 mL/h at the nal step.573The total desensitization time varies depending on the dose but typically takes 6 to 9 hours.TABLE LXXI.

Classification of LAs mostly used in S69A few more case reports regarding successful imiglucerase desensitization have been reported by Peroni et al574(a 7-step rush protocol, total infusion time of 4 hours, nal infusion rate of 400 units/h), Erdogdu et al,578and Tsilochristou et al.579 The 12-step protocol for administration of 1500 units of imi- glucerase over 5.7 hours is presented in Table LXIX .578 Vaccines (by Matthew Giannetti, MD) General. The reported incidence of anyadverse effect after vaccine administration is 11.4 per 100,000, of which fever andinjection-site reactions are most common.580The incidence of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity is much lower. One retrospective US study analyzed data from 2009 to 2011 and reported 33 of 25,173,965 cases of anaphylaxis with no deaths (1.31 cases/ million doses).581Another study reported an incidence of im- mediate hypersensitivity to be 1 of 450,000 vaccines adminis-tered. Thirty-one percent of reactions occurred after the rst administration of the vaccine, thus suggesting preexistingsensitization. 582 Clinical manifestations. Clinical symptoms can be divided into immediate and delayed reactions. Immediate reactions occurminutes to hours after vaccination and may include urticaria/angioedema, flushing, pruritus, wheezing, dyspnea, and hypo- tension. 583Delayed reactions occur more than 60 minutes after vaccination and include rash, fever, and joint pain.584Symptoms such as fever and injection-site edema are not considered mani- festations of hypersensitivity and should not preclude future doses of the vaccine.585 Diagnosis. IgE-mediated reactions are more likely to be directed at vaccine components than the active ingredient.584 Causative components include gelatin, egg protein, latex, andyeast. Therefore, skin testing should encompass the vaccine andTABLE LXXIV.

When skin testing to the vaccine itself, testing should use an identical vaccine (same dose and manufacturer) as that which caused the reaction. Skin prick testing should begin with full-strength vaccine. If the PT result is negative (with appropriate controls), proceed tointradermal testing using 0.02 mL of a 1:100 dilution. 586Skin testing to gelatin, egg, latex, and yeast should be conducted in the usual manner. If skin testing is not possible (standardized latex and gelatin are not routinely available in the United States),substitution with in vitro specic IgE-antibody assays is appro- priate, though sensitivity is typically lower with speci c IgE testing. 587If testing result is positive, the patient must be considered allergic. Negative skin testing result virtually excludesthe possibility of an IgE antibody to the vaccine or vaccine component. 586 Management. Patients who present with mild symptoms that are not compatible with IgE-mediated hypersensitivitym a yb ea d m i n i s t e r e dt h ev a c c ine in the usual manner. Ex- ceptions include absolute contraindications such as Guillain- Barr\u00e9, SJS, encephalopathy, and other severe delayed reactions. All patients who report symptoms consistent with IgE- mediated hypersensitivity should undergo skin testing. Sincenegative skin testing virtually excludes the presence of an IgE- mediated reaction, these patients may be given the vaccine in the usual manner, followed by a 30-minute observationperiod. 586Alternatively, one-tenth of the vaccine may be administered, followed by a 30-minute observation period,then the remaining dose. Patients with positive skin testingresult are more likely allergic to the vaccine; however, patients with positive skin testing result have also received the vaccine uneventfully. If additional doses are required, these should beadministered using a graded dose protocol ( Table LXX ). In all cases, appropriate medication should be available for imme-diate treatment as necessary. Patients with a preexisting allergy to a vaccine component (without previous exposure to the vaccine itself) may warrant further evaluation. Patients with gelatin allergy should undergoskin testing to gelatin before receiving the varicella zoster, mea-sles-mumps-rubella, or rabies vaccines. 588Gelatin skin testing is typically not available in the United States; testing for bothbovine and porcine gelatin speci c IgE is an appropriate alter- native. However, Kelso et al 586describe a gelatin preparation made by dissolving 1 teaspoon (5 g) of any sugared gelatinpowder (eg, Jell-O) in 5 mL of normal saline to create an SPTsolution, recognizing that this is not a standardized, validated, FDA-approved method. Patients allergic to egg require evalua- tion before receiving the yellow fever vaccine (all other vaccinesare safe in patients with egg allergy). 589,590Patients akkergic to yeast should be evaluated before receiving the hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccines. Evaluation should include serum-speci c IgE to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker 's yeast) and/ or skin prick testing to S cerevisiae . Finally, a history of imme- diate hypersensitivity to latex, neomycin, streptomycin, orpolymyxin B warrants evaluation before the administration of avaccine containing these compounds. Positive skin testing result should prompt desensitization to the necessary vaccine. Table LXX assumes a vaccine with a standard volume of 0.5 mL. Each dose should be followed by a 15-minute observationbefore proceeding to the next step. After completion, the patient should be observed for 30 minutes. LOCAL AND GENERAL ANESTHETICS AND OPIATESPerioperative immediate hypersensitivity (by Pascale Dewachter, MD, PhD, and David L. Hepner, MD, MPH) Epidemiology. In the early 1980s, the overall incidence of perioperative immediate hypersensitivity was estimated to be 1 in 5,000 to 13,000 anesthetics administered in Australia, 1 in 4,600in France, 1 in 1,250 to 5,000 in New Zealand, and 1 in 3,500 in the United Kingdom. 591-594By the end of the 1990s, the overall incidence of perioperative IgE-mediated anaphylaxis was 1 in 1,000 to 20,000 anesthetics administered in Australia and 1 in 13,000 in France.595,596Recently, over the last decade, the combined allergic and nonallergic anaphylaxis rate with an anesthetic was estimated to be 1 in 11,000 in Western Australiaand 1 in 10,000 in the United Kingdom. 597,598More precisely, an IgE-mediated mechanism has been involved in half and up totwo-thirds of the cases of perioperative immediate hypersensi-tivity in the United States, Spain, Norway, and France. 599-602 Perioperative IgE-mediated allergy mainly occurs after anestheticinduction and is primarily linked to neuromuscular-blockingagents (NMBAs) and antibiotics such as b-lactam drugs; it may also arise during the maintenance phase of anesthesia and agentsunrelated to anesthetics are then usually involved. 603A female predominance has been regularly reported for both IgE-mediated and non eIgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, irrespective of the causal agent, whereas immediate IgE-mediated drug allergy is uncommon in children.599-602The incidence of perioperative latex allergy continues to decrease. The morbidity rate of perioperative IgE-mediated anaphylaxis remains unknown. The latest National Audit Project (NAP6) reported a mortality rate of 3.8% among 266 reports of anaphylaxis from all UK National Health Service hospitals over 1 year (November 2015 to November 2016).598In contrast, a previous Western Australian retrospective study (January 2000 to December 2009) suggested that perioperative anaphylaxis mor- tality rate is within the range of 0% to 1.4% and that the higherrates, that is, 3% and up to 10%, reported during the last 2decades may be an overestimate. 597,604-607 In summary, the incidence of perioperative anaphylaxis likely remains underestimated because not all cases are investigated,reported to the Drug Safety Monitoring Authorities , or included in a national register. Conversely, the related mortality seems to belower than previously reported. Clinical presentation. Perioperative immediate hypersensi- tivity mainly occurs within minutes after anesthetic inductionand is primarily linked to agents administered intravenously. 603 The initial diagnosis of perioperative immediate hypersensitivityis based on the ongoing features and their severity, as well as thetiming between the introduction of the suspected drug and the onset of clinical symptoms. The clinical presentation of periop- erative nonallergic hypersensitivity is usually mild or moderateand less severe than that of IgE-mediated allergic hypersensitiv- ity, this latter condition being mostly life-threatening. 603,608The care management of perioperative immediate hypersensitivity is guided by the clinical expression of the reaction.600,609-612J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL Aspirin desensitization for patients with AERD * Oral protocols Time Aspirin dose (mg) Two-day protocol Dose escalation 180 min Day 1 8:00 am 20-40 11:00 am 40-60 2:00 pm 60-100 5:00 pm Discharge Day 2 8:00 am 150 11:00 am 325 2:00 pm Discharge One-day protocol Dose escalation 90 min 8:00 am 40.5 9:30 am 81 11:00 am 162 12:30 pm 325 2:00 pm Discharge Intranasal ketorolac and oral aspirin protocol Day 1 8:00 am 1.26 mg ketorolac (1 spray in 1 nostril) 8:30 am 2.52 mg ketorolac (1 spray in each nostril) 9:00 am 5.04 mg ketorolac (2 sprays in each nostril) 9:30 am 7.56 mg ketorolac (3 sprays in each nostril) 10:30 am 60 12:00 pm 60 3:00 pm Discharge Day 2 8:00 am 150 11:00 am 325 2:00 pm Discharge Aspirin desensitization for patients without AERD z Option 1: Dose escalation: Every 15-30 min until target daily dose has been tolerated682 Day 1 0 1 15 2 30 5 45 10 60 20 75 40 90 81x Option 2: Dose repeated every 90 min until no further reaction symptoms682 Day 1 0 40.5 90 40.5x 180 Repeat 40.5 only if patient reacts x Recommendations for treatment of NSAID-induced reactions Respiratory Bronchodilators zileuton is strongly recommended for all AERD protocols.

This 4-step gradingscale, widely used in Europe, has been adapted as follows for theperioperative setting ( Table LXXI ). 603,608-611Grade I reactions involve mucocutaneous signs only, whereas grade II reactionscorrespond to mucocutaneous features that may be associatedwith mild cardiovascular (hypotension, tachycardia) and/or res- piratory signs. The cardinal sign of grade III reactions is car- diovascular collapse, which may be associated withmucocutaneous signs and bronchospasm. Grade IV reactions present with circulatory arrest. Thus, grade I and II reactions are not life-threatening conditions and usually of nonallergic originbut sometimes may be IgE-mediated. However, grade III and IV reactions are typically being referred to as anaphylaxis, that is, a life-threatening immediate hypersensitivity more likely to be IgE- mediated. All these grades thus require subsequent allergologicinvestigation. Major symptoms. Cardiovascular homeostasis disturbances are the hallmark of drug-induced perioperative immediate hy-persensitivity. These cardiovascular features are usually associated with mucocutaneous signs and may be associated with respira- tory symptoms. Non eIgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity may include mucocutaneous signs alone or hypotension associ- ated with tachycardia and mucocutaneous signs. The most common pattern of perioperative drug-induced IgE-mediatedallergy is consistent with cardiovascular collapse usually associ-ated with tachycardia, or in some cases with bradycardia and cutaneous features (generalized erythema and/or extensive urti- caria). These cutaneous features are sometimes associated withmucous signs (eyelid and/or lip angioedema). Particularly during the maintenance phase of anesthesia, cutaneous signs may be initially missed because of surgical drapes. In grade III reactions,the cardiovascular collapse may rapidly evolve into cardiac arrhythmia and/or circulatory arrest if not recognized and/or treated appropriately. Cardiovascular collapse as the sole featureor circulatory arrest may also be the inaugural event of periop- erative drug-induced allergic anaphylaxis. 608-612In this setting, circulatory as pulseless electrical activity.598,603,613,614 Mucocutaneous signs (eg, generalized erythema) are usually present since the early stage of anaphylaxis but may be absentbefore the restoration of hemodynamic parameters. Broncho-spasm may also be present, especially in patients with poorly controlled underlying airway hyperreactivity (eg, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). In contrast,isolated bronchospasm is never of allergic origin. 615Gastroin- testinal signs are usually not reported during the perioperativesetting. 603,608 Tako-Tsubo syndrome following perioperative anaphylaxis. Tako-Tsubo syndrome is characterized by an acute but reversible left ventricular systolic dysfunction and shares common features with acute coronary syndrome.616This condition has been previously described under different names including broken heart syndrome orstress cardiomyopathy orapical ballooning syndrome . Recently, an international expert consensusprovided diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of Tako-Tsubo syndrome to improve its identi cation and strati cation.617,618 The main diagnostic (1) transientleft ventricular dysfunction; (2) electrocardiographic abnormal-ities (rare cases may exist any electrocardiographic changes); (3) levels of cardiac biomarkers (troponin and creatine kinase) moderately elevated in most cases; signi cant elevation in level of brain common; (4) and chromocytoma may serve as triggers; and (5) emotional and/orphysical triggers may precede the syndrome. Four major variants of Tako-Tsubo syndrome have been described, based on the anatomic distribution of regional wallmotion abnormalities. The left ventricular apical ballooning, alsoknown as the typical form of Tako-Tsubo syndrome, is the most common phenotype. Atypical phenotypes include wall motion patterns in the and focal anatomic areas.Tako-Tsubo syndrome following perioperative anaphylaxis has been published. In this setting, inappropriate high doses of exogenous epinephrine appear to be the common trigger. 619,620 The basal phenotype has been reported to be associated with epinephrine-induced Tako-Tsubo syndrome, which is charac- terized by a rapid onset of symptoms after epinephrine admin-istration. 617,620However, the contributive role of endogenous catecholamines in cannot be ruled out.621 Agents involved. Perioperative IgE-mediated anaphylaxis usually occurs within minutes of anesthetic induction.608In this clinical setting, NMBAs and antibiotics (mainly b-lactam agents) are the main drugs involved.599,601,602Anaphylaxis may also arise during the maintenance phase of anesthesia and is usually due to agents unrelated to the anesthetic. These agents given during asurgery include dyes (methylene blue, patent blue V and aprotinin), and other biological sealants. 603,608Ethylene oxide einduced anaphylaxis has also been suggested as a cause of perioperativeanaphylaxis. However, it appears that most of the reactionsattributed to ethylene oxide were due to latex. 622Systemic cooling has also been reported as a trigger for perioperativeanaphylaxis. 623Finally, anaphylaxis may also occur toward the end of the anesthetic induction or during the recovery period after the injection of sugammadex or neostigmine used for NMBA reversal.624,625 Neuromuscular-blocking agents. NMBAs charged radicals[N \u00fe(CH 3)3] mimicking the quaternary nitrogen radical of similarity in structure attracts NMBAs tonicotinic receptors. NMBAs can be classi ed according to their mechanism of action, as depolarizing and nondepolarizingagents. Succinylcholine, a depolarizing agent, is an agonist receptors. Nondepolarizing agents are competitive antagonists at the acetylcholine receptor and grouped according to their chemical structure into steroidal (pancuronium,rocuronium, vecuronium) and benzylisoquinolin elicit allergic immediate hy- persensitivity, which a PRACT VOLUME 8, NUMBER 9SBROYLES ET AL S73is, grade III reaction, and in some rare cases, consistent with an inaugural grade IV reaction.603,626The substituted (tertiary as well as quaternary) ammonium ions have been suggested to be the allergenic determinants of NMBAs since the 1980s.627,628 Although cross-reactivity between NMBAs is common, it isunusual that an individual is allergic to all NMBAs. 629Cross- reactivity refers to the drug allergenicity and to the allergenic prole of the patient. A higher prevalence of serum IgE antibodies to tertiary and/or quaternary ammonium ions among blood donors and atopicpatients was reported in Norway but not in Sweden. The only difference in environmental chemical exposure was the use ofcough syrups containing pholcodine available only in Norway. 630 Other work demonstrated a higher prevalence of serum IgE antibodies to tertiary and/or quaternary ammonium ions and/or to pholcodine, morphine, and suxamethonium after pholcodineexposure in atopic patients and in a few patients with a history of NMBA-induced anaphylaxis. 630-632The use of drugs containing pholcodine was therefore questioned, because of the potential risk for NMBA hypersensitivity.631,632However, no relationship has been clinically established between these increased IgE levelsand the occurrence of NMBA allergy during a subsequentanesthetic. The European Medicines Agency therefore stated that the existing evidence does not support the use of pholcodine- containing medicines as a risk for developing NMBA allergy. 633 Currently, the only known risk factor for NMBA-allergic hypersensitivity is a previous noninvestigated immediate hyper-sensitivity reaction that occurred during a previous anesthetic induction conducted with an NMBA. 609-611 ,626Nevertheless, uneventful previous exposure to an NMBA does not exclude the risk for IgE-mediated allergy during a subsequent anestheticinduction.608,609In addition, NMBA allergy may occur without previous NMBA exposure.609,611,626,628 Finally, benzylisoquinoline NMBAs, such as atracurium and mivacurium (both are not available in the United States), maydirectly stimulate histamine release (ie, nonallergic immediate hypersensitivity), Sugammadex is a modi edg-cyclodextrin with a lipophilic core and hydrophilic periphery. It is used toreverse neuromuscular blockade by encapsulating steroidalNMBAs (rocuronium, vecuronium) and displacing them from their receptors. Cyclodextrins are made up of dextrose units ( a-, b-, and g-cyclodextrins). Sugammadex-induced immediate allergic hypersensitivity has been reported.625Theg-cyclodextrin unit that contains 8 thiopropionate side chains may be respon-sible for hypersensitivity reactions. Neostigmine. Neostigmine is structurally similar to acetyl- choline but contains a carbamate group instead of the Neostigmine is an competitively antagonizes nondepolarizing NMBAs. A IgE-mediated cases allergy have beenreported. 624,634 Hypnotic agents. Propofol : Propofol is alkylphenol derivative (2,6-di-isopropylphenol) marketed as 10% widely used.

A retrospective investigation of 171 anesthetic charts from 99 patients with elevated speci c IgE to egg, soy, or peanut showed no documented IgE-mediated allergy to propo- fol.636According to this study and previous reports, there is no reason to avoid propofol in patients with allergy to egg, soy, and peanut.626,636 Other intravenous induction isextremely widespread use. 79,610,611Ketamine is a hydrosoluble aryl-cyclo-alkylamine. There is no documented report of IgE-mediated allergic hypersensitivity to this drug. Inhaled anesthetics. Halogenated general anesthetic agents are volatile liquids administered by inhalation of the vapor. The chemical structures of these agents include fluorinated methyl- ethyl-ethers is no report allergic hypersensitivity to these volatile anesthetics. Opioids. Morphine is a tertiary amine that, when insuf ciently diluted, causes nonspeci c direct histamine release leading false- positive skin test results.610,611Alfentanil, fentanyl, remifentanil, and sufentanil belong to the phenylpiperidine derivatives and have no local effect on mast cells. No IgE-mediated allergy has been re-ported with alfentanil, remifentanil, and sufentanil. A few cases of immediate allergy to fentanyl have been reported, but the diagnosis has not been proven because of methodologic issues. 637,638 Local anesthetics. Local anesthetics (LAs) belong to the ester or amide groups (Table LXXII aromaticgroup, an intermediate ester linkage, and a hydrophilic residue with a tertiary amine. The metabolism of ester LAs is via plasma cholinesterases. Para-aminobenzoic acid is the common metab-olite of ester LAs inducing immediate and delayed hypersensi- tivity reactions. Cross-reactivity is the rule among esters due ropivacaine, that they have an intermediate amide linkage. The metabolism of amide LAs is primarily in the liver. IgE-mediated allergy to amideLAs is extremely rare relative to their widespread use. 609-611Most reported reactions are vasovagal episodes or toxic reactions frominadvertent intravascular injection of an LA or epinephrine.Delayed hypersensitivity to amide LAs has also been reported. Cross-reactivity in the amide group has been established for immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions. 639-641There is no cross-reactivity between IgE-mediated allergy to chlor- hexidine is being increasingly recognized in Denmark and theUnited Kingdom but not in France. 598,642,643In a retrospective (July 2004 to July 2012) single-center study, speci c IgE and skin tests (including PTs and IDT) to chlorhexidine werecompleted in 228 patients investigated for suspected periopera-tive allergic reactions. 642,643About 10% of examined cases metcriteria for chlorhexidine allergy de ned as a relevant clinical reaction combined with 2 or more positive test results. The highest combined estimated sensitivity and speci city was found for speci c IgE and SPT to chlorhexidine. Latex. The incidence of perioperative latex allergy is drastically decreasing.600,602This is because most hospitals now use pow- der-free latex gloves with negligible residual protein concentra- tions and/or nonlatex gloves.635In addition, the use of natural rubber latex in medical products and/or equipment has beenreduced. Latex-induced immediate allergy is now infrequentlyreported in the perioperative setting. Diagnosis. The etiologic diagnosis of perioperative immediate hypersensitivity is linked to a triad including clinical evidencealong with biological and allergologic results. 609-612The inter- pretation of the biological and allergologic assessment shouldalways be correlated to the careful and complete review of theclinical history including the management care. The joint anal- ysis of these elements helps to determine the pathomechanism involved (allergic vs nonallergic), identify the culprit agent, andprovide subsequent and appropriate advice for further anesthetics. In vivo biochemical tests. Plasma histamine : Plasma his- tamine is a preformed in flammatory mediator stored in mast cells and basophils. An elevated concentration of plasma histamine indicates in vivo release and is observed during both allergic and nonallergic immediate hypersensitivity. The peak of plasmahistamine is immediate (normal <10 nmol/L), and its plasma is short (w15-20 Diamine-oxi-dase enzyme inactivates histamine in humans and shows thehighest expression in the intestine, kidney, and placenta. Because the enzymatic activity of diamine-oxidase increases several hun- dred-fold during gestation compared with nonpregnant in-dividuals and plasma histamine rapidly decreases in a concentration-dependent manner to levels below 1 ng/mL, plasma histamine should not be measured after the rst trimester of pregnancy. 609-611 ,644 Plasma histamine should ideally be measured within 15 mi- nutes after the onset of clinical features in cases of grade I re-action, within 30 minutes after a grade II reaction, and within 2hours in grade III and IV reactions. 609-611 Tryptase : Tryptases are neutral serine proteases stored pre- dominantly in mast cells. In vivo, 2 major forms can be measured . Pro-atryptase reflects mast cell burden and is elevated in mastocytosis. Mature b-tryptase is preferentially stored in mast cells granules and is released during episodes of mast cell acti-vation, such as IgE-mediated allergy. The total tryptase level (normal <11 or 13 mg/L) measures both forms. Tryptase can be measured inserum orplasma. Total tryptase concentrations reach a peak at 1 hour after the onset of the reaction and decline under rst-order kinetics (elimination half-life of w90 minutes).609-612 Although an increase in tryptase can be measured 30 to 60minutes after the onset of symptoms in cases of mild reactions(eg, nonallergic immediate hypersensitivity due to histamine release), it may not be elevated. Sampling is recommended within 30 minutes and 2 hours in cases of grade III and IV re-actions. 611,612An increase in tryptase is highly suggestive of mast cell activation, but its absence does not preclude the diagnosis ofIgE-mediated anaphylaxis. Baseline tryptase level should be ob-tained more than 24 hours after the clinical event or when theJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT VOLUME 8, NUMBER 9SBROYLES ET AL S75patient is referred for investigation and compared with acute tryptase levels.645,646 Histamine and tryptase concentrations correlate with the severity of the clinical reaction.13,611Combined histamine and tryptase measurements are recommended for the diag- nosis of perioperative immediate hypersensitivity in the United States and France.13,611,635The British and Scandi- navian guidelines metabolites (urinary methyl-histamine) is also recommended in the United States, because it is elevated for a longer duration of time than plasma histamine.13,635Its measurement has been discontinued in Europe.609-611 In vitro biochemical tests. Speci c serum IgE measurement : In vitro tests detect the presence of IgE antibodies by binding the allergen onto a solid phase and using radioactive system detection (radioallergosorbent test) or by binding the allergen onto a sponge matrix using fluorescent detection ( fluoroimmunoassay or CAP system).13,609-611Radioallergosorbent test is now rarely used. In vitro tests have been developed for the detection of speci c IgEs directed to the tertiary or quaternary ammonium groups of NMBAs using a quaternary ammonium (choline chloride). Theywork by coupling an analogue of onto a polysaccharidesupport on sepharose or p-aminophenylphosphoryl-choline on agarose, the latter being marketed only in France. 647,648Subse- quently, a morphine-based solid-phase IgE was proposed,because the tertiary of morphine cross-re- acts in vitro with NMBAs. 649 In Europe, the suxamethonium-speci c assay is currently available among the different commercialized NMBAs. Itssensitivity is relatively low, around 30% to 60%. 629Speci c serum IgE measurement is also available for other drugs including b-lactams (eg, ampicillin and amoxicillin chlorhexidine, and protamine inEurope and only to penicillin G and V in the United States.However, these in vitro specicI g Ea s s a y st od r u g sa r e less sensitive and speci cw h e nc o m p a r e dw i t hs k i n testing. 13,609-611Thus, identi cation of serum IgE to certain drugs provides possible evidence of IgE sensitization but doesn o tp r o v eb yi t s e l ft h a tt h ed r u gi n d u c e dt h ei m m e d i a t eh y - persensitivity reaction. 609 In addition, IgE-antibody assay is commercially available for latex. Although skin testing has a higher sensitivity (95%-99%)compared with IgE testing (35%-76%), a skin test reagent to latex is not commercially available in the United States. 650IgE-antibody testing may be performed at the time of the reaction or later.609-611 Basophil activation test. BAT is a sophisticated technique using flow cytometry, which allows quantifying the ex vivo ca- pacity of sensitized blood basophil activation. The upregulationof certain markers (CD63 and CD203c) present on the granule membrane is expressed on the basophil membrane on activation with the suspected allergen. BAT might add to the etiologicdiagnosis of immediate drug hypersensitivity (eg, NMBA) and help to identify both cross-reactive and safe alternative com- pounds. 609-611However, this technique is not commercially available. The latest recommendations provided by the ENDA and the Drug Allergy Interest Group of the EAACI stated that BAT is recommended for diagnosing NMBA immediate hy-persensitivity and, when available, BAT should be performedbefore skin testing, especially in life-threatening reactions. 651 However, a recent study showed that combined CD63 and CD203c markers did not increase BAT sensitivity compared with CD203c alone in the investigation of NMBA immediatehypersensitivity. BAT allowed identi cation of the culprit drug in 80% of patients with allergy to NMBA and yielded concor-dant cross-reactivity results in only 60% of the cases comparedwith skin tests results. The authors thus conclude that BAT combining CD63 and CD203c markers does not replace skin testing in the assessment of NMBA allergy. 645However, BAT is not commercially available and the role of BAT needs to be better de ned in the diagnostic approach of NMBA-induced immediate hypersensitivity, because skin testing is more sensitive than in vitro tests.609-611 Skin testing. Skin testing remains the criterion standard for the detection of IgE-mediated allergy versus nonallergic imme-diate hypersensitivity. All drugs to which the patient was exposedwithin minutes before the clinical reaction must be skin tested. 609-612Investigation of anesthetics is performed by PTs followed by IDTs using commercialized solutions undiluted or diluted without exceeding the maximum recommended con- centrations (ie, corresponding to the maximum nonirritant drug concentration).79,609-611 ,629PTs may produce false-negative re- sults, whereas IDTs are more sensitive but less speci c than PTs.609,610However, IDTs are more likely to trigger a systemic allergic reaction and, thus, should be performed only if PT re-sults are negative. 609,610Diagnostic criteria for a positive skin test result (including PT and IDT) and maximum recommended concentrations have been de ned in France.611They have been recommended and/or adapted by others, and endorsed by EAACI/ENDA (Table LXXIII).79,609,610,629 Skin testing should be performed according to the patho- mechanism of the immediate hypersensitivity reaction andthus interpreted by reading it within 15 to 20 minutes of the skin test. If the PT results are negative, IDT is performed by injecting 0.03 to 0.05 mL of the corresponding drug (eg,beginning at 1:10,000 or 1:1,000 dilution). If the IDT result is negative, a 10-fold increased concentration is used with in- cremental 15- to 20-minute intervals between each IDT until the test result is positive or the highest nonirritant concen- tration is achieved. It is usually recommended that skin testing be done at least 4 to 6 weeks after the clinical reaction to avoid false-negativetest results. 652Dialysis and heavy tobacco smoking may lead to a decreased response due to cutaneous vasoconstriction,whereas cutaneous reactivity may be increased in cases ofdermographism. Finally, skin testing can be performed at any point during the pregnancy, especially for LAs and NMBAs. 611 In conclusion, a suggestive clinical history with a mild reaction without an increase in tryptase and a negative skin test result is indicative of a nonallergic reaction, such as histamine release. The use of preoperative H 1-receptor antagonists reduces the clinical effects of histamine release. Conversely, immediate hy- persensitivity reactions requiring emergency treatment, and associated with an increased tryptase and positive skin test resultsto the suspected drug/agent, constitute evidence of an IgE- mediated mechanism. 609-612In this latter condition, the identi- ed drug/agent should be avoided in the future, whereas negative skin-tested drugs can be used for further procedures.608,611J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT OCTOBER 2020S76 BROYLES ET AL/C15NMBAs: The sensitivity of skin tests to NMBAs in patients having experienced NMBA anaphylaxis is greater than 95%, and their reproducibility is excellent.611Testing should be done by PTs, followed by IDTs. When skin testing result with an NMBA is positive, investigation for cross-reactivity with other available NMBAs should be performed to identify a safe alternative (ie, negative skin-tested NMBAs) for furtherprocedures. 608,611,645,653 /C15Sugammadex: Sugammadex may be skin tested undiluted by PTs followed by IDTs if PT is negative (up to 1/100 dilution,which appeared nonirritant). 625 /C15Neostigmine: Neostigmine may be skin tested undiluted by PTs followed by IDTs if PT is negative (up to 1/100 dilution,which appeared nonirritant). 628 /C15Hypnotic agents: These drugs may be skin tested undiluted by PTs, followed by IDTs (up to 1/10 dilution) if PT results arenegative. 79,611 /C15Opioids: Phenylpiperidines may be skin tested undiluted by PTs followed by IDTs if PT results are negative (1/10 dilutionshould not be exceeded). However, 1/10 and 1/1000morphine dilutions are recommended for PT and IDT, respectively. 79,611 /C15LAs: LAs (without epinephrine) may be skin tested undiluted by PTs followed by IDTs if PT is negative (1/10 dilution should not be exceeded).79,611A protocol for subcutaneous incremental challenge (graded challenge) involves injections ofincreasing volumes of LA to which the patient has been provento be skin-tested negative. A single-blind saline step is done 15 to 20 minutes after the skin PT to rule out nonallergic causes. Following this (typically 15-20 minutes), 0.1 mL, 0.5 mL, and1 mL of undiluted subcutaneous injections of LA are used as challenge steps. It is ideal to wait 15 to 20 minutes between steps. 654 /C15Chlorhexidine: Chlorhexidine (without alcohol) may be skin tested up to 5 mg/mL by PTs followed by IDTs (up to 0.002mg/mL) if PT is negative. 79 /C15Latex: In contrast to the United States, in Europe, latex allergy investigation is performed by PTs using commercial extracts. The sensitivity of skin tests with latex is excellent. Opioids and buprenorphine (by Parul Kothari, MD) General Opioids are generally used to treat both acute andchronic pain. The Drug Enforcement Agency classi es opi- oids in 5 different scheduling classes on the basis of their po- tential for abuse and addiction, which are the main concerns withtheir long-term use. Structurally, opioids can be placed into thefollowing 4 chemical classes include propoxyphene and methadone. In addition, based on their interaction with the m,k, and dreceptors, opioids buprenorphine), used to treat opioid overdose. Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. True type I im- mediate hypersensitivity reactions to opioids are rare and are limited to case reports in the literature.656-658Most adverse re- actions to opioids are side effects, often due to nonspeci c, direct release of mast cell mediators through interactions with the mast cell opioid receptor. However, it is often dif cult to distinguish between these 2 possibilities because their clinical manifestationscan overlap. Both can cause pruritus, flushing, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, bronchospasm, and hypotension. DHRs to opioids have also been reported. 659,660 Diagnosis. Although some case reports have demonstrated the presence of speci c IgE via skin or serum testing, currently there is no validated test for diagnosing an immediate hypersensitivity reaction.656-658Skin testing with narcotics can lead to nonspe- cic release of mast cell mediators, thereby eliciting a wheal-and- flare response even in the absence of speci c IgE.661As such, distinguishing between immune- and nonimmune-mediated re-actions is based on a careful history as well as physical exami- nation ndings at the time of the reaction. Nonirritating concentrations for skin testing that have been reported are pre- sented in Table LXXIV. 79 Although ACD has been reported for several different opioids, it appears to be most commonly associated with transdermalbuprenorphine. 659,660In these small case series, the diagnosis was conrmed with patch testing, and the ability to tolerate other opioids (oral and/or transdermal) was demonstrated. In 1 case,oral buprenorphine was given without any adverse reaction. Management. Prevention of future reactions will depend on the underlying mechanism. Nonspeci c adverse reactions, a class effect, can be inhibited by pretreating with antihistamines and/orsteroids, using lower doses, or using opioids with less histamine- releasing properties, such as fentanyl. 662However, for immune- mediated hypersensitivity reactions, strict avoidance of the culprit and metabolites is recommended. As such, because co- deine is metabolized to morphine, patients who are able to tolerate codeine but react to morphine are unlikely to have a trueallergy but those with evidence of an IgE-mediated allergic re-action to morphine should also avoid codeine. For patients with evidence of an immediate or delayed hy- persensitivity to an opioid, currently data to determine the risk ofcross-reactivity within and across different structural classes are limited. Case reports and series have shown that most patients with an allergic reaction are able to tolerate at least 1 other opioidbut too few patients have been studied to make accurate pre- dictions. Thus, if a patient requires treatment with a narcotic, it is recommended to use one that has been tolerated previously. Ifthat information is not known, one should determine whichalternative agent(s) could be safely administered by performing an oral challenge in a monitored setting. There are currently no standardized desensitization protocols for narcotic analgesics, buta desensitization protocol to sublingual buprenorphine has a non eIgE-mediated reaction (Table LXXV ). 663 The serial dilutions for desensitization were made by grounding and suspending buprenorphine sublingual tablets (2 mg). Given the lack of data on the stability of buprenorphine in solution, dilutions were prepared close to the time of administration tominimize any possible loss of potency.J ALLERGY CLIN 8, NUMBER 9SBROYLES S77NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS Aspirin (by Katherine N. Cahill, MD, and Ari J. Fried,MD) General. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are uni ed by their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. Any inhibitor of COX-1 can cause acute or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Aspirin-induced reactions are generallythe result of altered eicosanoid pathways following COX-1 inhibi- tion. The ease of access to NSAIDs and their clinical utility make them one of the leading causes of hypersensitivity reactions. Thereported prevalence of hypersensitivity reaction to aspirin and other COX-1 inhibitors in children is 0.3% and in adults is 1.9%; the prevalence among patients with asthma is an estimated 5% inchildren and 7.2% in adults. 664-667True NSAID hypersensitivity needs to be distinguished from an adverse reaction or intolerance to an NSAID such as tinnitus or gastrointestinal bleeding. Major symptoms Acute NSAID hypersensitivity reactions that are as selective NSAID-induced urticaria, angioedema, and/or anaphylaxis. NSAID-induced delayed reactions drug eruptions, DRESS, pneumonitis, aseptic meningitis, andnephritis are much less common than acute reactions (Table LXXVI). 668Both acute and delayed reactions have been reported in children and adults.669 AERD is unique among the NSAID-exacerbated reactions with the associated comorbidities of asthma and bronchospasm within 15 to 180 of NSAID exposure. Less frequently, angioedema, ur-ticaria, macular eruptions, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension have been reported. AERD is gener- ally considered an adult-onset disease, but AERD has been re-ported to develop as early as at age 8 years. 670 Diagnosis. The diagnostic workup for identi cation of NSAID hypersensitivity is the same for children and adults. Distinguishing selective COX inhibitor hypersensitivity from cross-reactive hypersensitivity is crucial to determine the beststrategy for further management. The evaluation has to start with a careful analysis of the history including symptom pattern and time course of the reaction. Oral aspirin challenge is the criterion standard for the diagnosis of AERD. 671NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease (NECD) patients have chronic urticaria and a history of an acute flare of urticaria and/or angioedema from NSAID, while patients angioedema from NSAID, and do not havean associated chronic respiratory or cutaneous condition. Patientswith either NECD or NIUA exhibit cross-reaction to unrelated COX-1 inhibitors \u2014which should be avoided. Chal- lenge procedures are commonly performed to aspirin in these patients when aspirin 81 mg daily is required for cardioprotection. Desensitization is not recommended in the setting of NECD but can be accomplished in patients with NIUA. For patients with ahistory suggesting selective NSAID-induced a challenge to rule out a cross-reacting NSAID hypersensitiv- ity. 17,672The role of skin testing or basophil activation testing to NSAIDs has not been validated and is not recommended. Serum- specic IgE has been reported in a case series of pyrazolone- induced anaphylaxis, a class of NSAIDs no longer available in theUnited States. 673The detection of serum-speci c IgEs for other NSAIDs has not been reported. In the setting of severe delayed reactions, reexposure to the culprit agent is not recommended and exposure to another member of the NSAID class can be consid-ered if medically necessary. With rare exception, selective COX-2 inhibitors are tolerated by patients with a history of COX-1 hy- persensitivity reactions, but reactions to selective COX-2 in-hibitors in patients with a history of COX-1 inhibitorhypersensitivity have been reported; as a precaution it may be appropriate to administer the initial dose under observation based on clinical circumstances. 674 Management. Although challenge protocols con rm the diag- nosis and subtype of NSAID hypersensitivity, desensitization pro-tocols provide a means to allow the to safely tolerate dailyaspirin ( Table LXXVI ). 675Aspirin challenge or desensitization followed by daily aspirin therapy is indicated for adult and pediatricpatients with AERD who require revision polypectomies orfrequent or daily corticosteroid therapy. Any patient with a history of an acute NSAID hypersensitivity reaction with a medical indi- cation (cardiovascular or rheumatologic disease) for aspirin or otherCOX-1 inhibitor should be offered desensitization. 676Before initiating a challenge or desensitization protocol, it is recommended that FEV 1be greater than 60% predicted and at least 1.5 L. Use of a leukotriene receptor antagonist in advance of the desensitization in patients with AERD decreases the severity of bronchospasm.677 In a small subset of patients with AERD, the use of leukotrienereceptor antagonists will completely mask the symptoms of a re-action. However, it is generally accepted that the added safety benet from their use outweighs this risk. Inhaled or oral cortico- steroids and long-acting bronchodilators should be continued and asthma should be optimized at the ti me of desensitization, with oral steroids added if necessary. Oral antihistamines and decongestantsa r ed i s c o n t i n u e d4 8h o u r sb e f o r ea n ds h o r t - a c t i n g b-agonists the morning of desensitization to avoid masking a clinical reaction.Challenge/desensitization protocols for AERD can take place in the outpatient setting, including for pediatric cases, with the exception of patients with recent myocardial infarction, continuous b-blocker therapy, or uncontrolled asthma.678 A standard oral aspirin desensitization protocol for AERD begins with a dose of 40 mg of aspirin, with dose escalation every90 to 180 minutes, as outlined in Table LXXVI. At the onset of reaction symptoms, the patient is monitored and symptomatictreatment with b-agonists, antihistamines, nasal decongestants, and 5-lipooxygenase inhibitors can be used to ensure patientsafety and comfort. Shorter oral protocols have been reported in the literature. 679Alternatively, a modi ed protocol using intra- nasal ketolorac is available that reduces extrapulmonary reactions during desensitization.680Once a patient has tolerated 325 mg of aspirin without evidence of symptoms, they can increase theirdose of aspirin to the recommended treatment dose of 650 mgtwice daily at home. If aspirin is discontinued for more than 48 hours, the desensitized state can be lost and repeat desensitization is recommended. In the event of a planned surgical procedureduring which aspirin should be avoided, the daily aspirin doseJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT OCTOBER 2020S78 BROYLES ET ALcan be decreased to 81 mg leading up to the procedure, held the day before and the morning of the procedure, and immediately resumed after the procedure is completed. For other non-AERD reactions to NSAIDs, challenge pro- tocols are published.675In clinical practice, there is less consensus about the dose and timing intervals for challenge/desensitization due to the wide range of clinical history, reaction severity, andsubtype of NSAID hypersensitivity encountered. Aspirin is the preferred agent in a desensitization protocol for non-AERD NSAID hypersensitivity because there are no veri ed reports anaphylaxis from aspirin. 681For those with non-AERD NSAID hypersensitivity and a clinical indication for daily aspirin use suchas after cardiac stent placement, aspirin challenge or desensiti-zation using 1 of 2 rapid protocols has demonstrated success. 682 Both protocols reach the established antiplatelet threshold of 81 mg within 2 to 3 hours ( Table LXXVI). Acetaminophen (by Samantha Minnicozzi, MD) Acetaminophen is one of the most commonly used drugs in the world. It is a medication that is generally well tolerated, and it is frequently used as an alternative agent for patients with aspirinhypersensitivity. 683Hypersensitivity reactions are exceedingly rare, with limited data and reports of suspected IgE-mediated reactions.There are numerous case reports and some case series describinganaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions to acetaminophen. 683-696 Acetaminophen is classi ed as an NSAID, but it is a weak cyclooxygenase inhibitor and does not provide any anti-in flam- matory effects.683However, a number of patients who are aspirin intolerant can also be intolerant of acetaminophen, and someacetaminophen-speci c reactions can also be either dependent on or independent of dose. 684,689,691,692 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. In a review of acetaminophen hypersensitivity reactions reported over a 4-yearperiod to a private allergy clinic in France, 84 patients wereidenti ed. 683Of these 84 patients, 13 were considered identi ed to have an allergy based on history and oral challenge testing.Their symptoms consisted of maculopapular eruptions, urticaria,bronchospasm, rhinitis, and laryngeal edema. 683Other case re- highlight patients who experience similar symptoms butalso have hypotension, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. 686,690,694,697 In addition to immediate hypersensitivity reactions, case re- ports in the literature have described acetaminophen 's association with SJS reactions.698 Diagnosis. The validity of skin testing to acetaminophen is unknown. However, in case reports citing skin prick and intra-dermal testing at various concentrations, all control subjects havebeen negative. 685,687,688,692,696,697Of the skin testing protocols proposed, many are not feasible because the sterile formsrequired for intradermal testing do not exist in many countries.Currently, the only intravenous formulation of acetaminophen isa single concentration of 10 mg/mL. This only allows for in- tradermal testing to occur with dilutions of this formulation. The protocol described by Rojas-Perez-Ezquerra et al 697uses the intravenous formulation of acetaminophen with a concentration of 10 mg/mL for skin prick testing, and a dilution of 1 mg/mL as well as the undiluted 10 mg/mL for intradermal testing. How-ever, patients and control subjects in that study tested negative on skin prick and intradermal testing. Other reviews published on acetaminophen allergy use solely SPTs up to concentrations of 200 mg/mL despite evidenceelsewhere demonstrating that concentrations more than 10 mg/ mL can be known irritants leading to false positives for drugs. 688,692,696 Management. Of the studies identifying patients with a history concerning for acetaminophen hypersensitivity, the cur- rent recommendations for de nitive evidence of a reaction are oral-based challenge tests.696This is because of the relatively infrequent occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions associatedwith acetaminophen use. 683,688,689,695Table LXXVII highlights the common methods of graded challenges performed for bothsuspicion of anaphylaxis and NSAID-related reactions. 693,696A recent meta-analysis including 259 patients who underwent oral challenges to acetaminophen for diagnostic con rmation or exclusion estimates the prevalence of true acetaminophen hy- persensitivity to be 10.1% in adults and pediatric patients.699 ANTICOAGULANTS AND COAGULATION FACTORSClopidogrel and antiplatelet agents (by of ADP-induced platelet aggregation for oral belongs to the class of second-generation thienopyridine antiplatelet agents.

Additionalindications include acute management of myocardial infarctions,peripheral artery disease, or cerebral vascular accident. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to clopidogrel have been reported to range from 1% to 6% of exposures, with most es-timates ranging from 1% to 3%. 700-702 Major symptoms. The most common hypersensitivity re- action to clopidogrel is rash, commonly macular, morbilli-form, or diffuse and erythematous, beginning about 5 daysinto treatment. 703, 704In addition to these likely T- celle mediated drug eruptions, IgE-mediated reactions of reactions to clopidogrel.707Worldwide postmarketing pharmaceutical experience reports thatanaphylactic reactions occur in fewer than 1% of cases. 701 Other reactions including systemi c hypersensitivity syndromes have been described, including a serum sickness elike reaction, x e dd r u ge r u p t i o n ,a n dS J S .708Current literature review does not describe DRESS syndrome, TEN, or acute interstitial nephritis attributed to clopidogrel use. Diagnosis. There is no validated skin testing or patch testing to clopidogrel. However, diagnostic testing could follow the procedures of the largest case series (42 patients) evaluated with both immediate hypersensitivity testing and patch testing after a history suggestive of hypersensitivity to clopidogrel(Table LXXVIII ). 706Of the 42 patients tested, most had a his- tory consistent with a delayed rash.

In addition, the utility of testing for cutaneous eruptions that are not IgE-mediated is unknown, but can be helpful for some cutaneous eruptions, including mac-ulopapular eruptions, AGEP, and xed drug eruptions. 13,51,709- 711 Management Alternative agents.

There is concern about cross-reactivity between clopidogrel and ticlopidine because the structure differs only by an addition of a caboxymethyl groupand they have shared metabolites in vitro (Figure 7 ). Cross- reactivity determined by patch-test result was found in 24% ofpatients. 706Given available data to date, if ticlopidine were to be used in a patient with a history of allergy to clopidogrel, an oral challenge would be advised (Table LXXIX ). Prasugrel is the most potent of the thienopryridines, but it is contraindicated in patients with previous cerebrovascular acci- dent, age more than 75 years, or weight less than 60 kg. There is concern regarding cross-reactivity to clopidogrel, because they are structurally similar (Figure 7 ). No data currently exist on cross- reactivity between clopidogrel and prasugrel, because the clinical trials for prasugrel excluded patients with a history of allergy to ticlopidine or clopidogrel. One study demonstrated a 17% cross-reactivity with prasugrel using patch testing, and there are reports of patients with a history of allergy to clopidogrel who subse- quently tolerated prasugrel. 706,712-714Given available allergy data, if prasugrel were to be used in a patient with a history ofallergy to clopidogrel, or vice versa, an oral challenge would be recommended ( Table LXXIX ). Ticagrelor, which is a reversible P2Y12 inhibitor and a strong antiplatelet, is completely structurally dissimilar from clopidog-rel. Although a previous report hypothesized cross-reactivity, review of the case and symptoms reported more likely re flected a reaction to the clopidogrel and stronger evidence supports that ticagrelor can be safely administered to patients with clopidogrel hypersensitivity. 715-717 Oral challenge. An oral graded challenge to clopidogrel would be appropriate if the reaction (1) was unlikely to havebeen caused by clopidogrel, (2) was not IgE-mediated/serious/life-threatening and the bene ts of clopidogrel use outweighed the risk of reaction, and (3) led to initiation of a potentially cross- reactive drug (eg, ticlopidine). Desensitization. Desensitization protocols for clopidogrel safe and successful, and have been used bothfor IgE-mediated reactions and for delayed cutaneous reactions. Contraindications to desensitization include severe T-cellemediated reactions such as DRESS, TEN, or SJS. In a study of 24 patients who underwent a desensitization procedure, 100%of the patients had successful desensitization and all patients weretaking clopidogrel at the 6-month follow-up. Most patients(83%) reactions during the desensitization pro-cedure. 707Published desensitization procedures range from 2 Table LXXX ).718The 2-hour or 7-hour desensitization procedures are recommended on the basis of severity of the al-lergy history, considering both the type and severity of the re- action, as well as considering comorbidities and acuity of the patient 's illness. Recently, outpatient multiday protocols have been used for patients with clopidogrel hypersensitivity (largely rash, but 1 patient had angioedema) with success. 719One disadvantage of using a desensitization protocol for clopidogrel hypersensitivity, particularly after stent placement, is that it re- quires initial cessation of clopidogrel to allow for a washout period and symptom resolution. However, patients may betreated with an alternative agent (eg, ticlopidine) during thisperiod. Drug continuation with treatment with steroids and antihistamines. Because cardiology data show a signi cant risk (25%-30%) of thrombosis with interruption of antiplatelet therapy, some groups have used course and benadryl 25 to 50 mg Q6-8PRN without drug stoppage. This approach was successful in 98% of patients, with the rashesresolving in about 5 days and all patients had uninterrupted dual platelet therapy. Among their 62 patients, this approach failed in 1 patient who developed angioedema and required hospitaliza-tion. 706Among 25 patients with delayed rashes who were treated with steroids (methylprednisolone) and antihistamines (fex-ofenadine 180 mg every day with 25-50 mg diphenhydramineQHS) for a mean of 10 /C68 days without interruption of clo- pidogrel, 22 of 25 (88%) patients had no adverse effects/eventsin long-term follow-up, and all completed clopidogrel therapyaccording to the America Heart Association guidelines. 705The mean duration of steroid treatment was 10 days. Two patients had recurrent symptoms, treated with more corticosteroids (18 days starting with prednisone 60 mg), an antileukotriene(montelukast 10 mg), and antihistamines. In sum, 3 patients failed this therapy, with 1 patient each having angioedema, a desquamating rash, and intolerable pruritus. Another group usedprednisone 30 mg twice a day with cetirizine 10 mg daily with success. 721Given these encouraging data, this strategy is reasonable for benign, maculopapular, or erythematous eruptions that are likely to be T-cell emediated and without organ involvement. However, this strategy is not recommended in IgE- mediated reactions, especially those involving organ systems beyond the skin, where desensitization is indicated, or rashessuggestive of a severe T-cell emediated reaction. Caution is also warranted when using this approach for cutaneous reactionssuggestive of IgE (eg, urticaria) given that these studies demon-strating this approach to urticarial rashes are not robust enough to determine the safety of this approach. Heparin and protamine (by Cosby Stone Jr, MD, MPH, and Allison Norton, MD) General. Heparin is a widely used anticoagulating agent for the active treatment and prophylaxis of thrombosis in at-risk pa- tients. Side effects of heparin are overall quite rare consideringthe frequency of its use in hospitalized patients for the preventionJ ALLERGY CLIN of hypersensitivity to heparin are DHRs, which can affect up to 7.5% of patientstreated, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). 722-724 There are, however, rare reports of immediate hypersensitivityreactions. 725,726In the past, when heparin products were contaminated with overly sulfated chondroitin sulfates, non- eIgE-mediated anaphylaxis was reported via the kinin-kalikrein pathway through the production of bradykinin, as well as C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins.727In addition, immediate tivity to protamine, the main reversal agent for heparin-mediatedanticoagulation, has occurred, and can easily be mistaken for anallergy to heparin or insulin. 728,729 Heparins the glycosamino- glycan family rst puri ed from pig intestines with the property of being naturally occurring activators of anti-thrombin III, and they achieve their anticoagulation effects by antithrombin III emediated inactivation of thrombin. 730 Unfractionated heparin (UFH) can include heparins of various molecular weights and lengths, typically averaging 14 to 18 kDa.722,730Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have been modi ed by fractionation or depolymerizaton to provide a puri ed product, in which at least 60% of chains are less than 8 kDa in length, to reduce the biologicalunpredictability of UFH. Heparinoids are synthetic mole- cules designed to mimic the site of heparin toantithrombin III (Table LXXXII ). 722 Because of their strong negative charge, UFH and LMWHs can be inactivated by the highly originally derived from salmon spermatozoa. itself been shown to cause IgE-mediated hypersensi- tivity reactions, especially in patients previously exposed toprotamine-containing insulins. 13,531,728,731Fish allergy and va- sectomy have previously been alleged as risk factors for protaminereaction, but there is no substantiated evidence to support thisclaim. 732,733 Cross-reactivity. Wide ranges of cross-reactivity have been reported to occur in LMWHs in DHR, but fondaparinux and danaparoid are generally well tolerated.722Hypersensitivity to UFH is reported to be frequently cross-reactive with LMWHs and heparinoids.723,726Hypersensitivity to heparin is not cross-reactive with struc- distinct anticoagulants such as hirudins or factor Xa in-hibitors, and these are often used as alternative agents. 725,734 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Heparins have been demonstrated most commonly to cause DHR, of which the most typical feature is an itching, eczematous plaque, or mac- ulopapular eruption that rst appears around sites of injection after 7 to 10 days of continuous initial treatment, and can appearmore rapidly on subsequent exposures. 723,726,730,735,736 Immediate-type angioedema, and swelling of the larynx have devel-oped patients after receiving heparin products contaminatedwith oversulfated chondroitin sulfates. 727 Mild thrombocytopenia is noted in the setting of UFH use in about 30% to 50% of critically ill patients, but severe HIT viaIgG speci c for large complexes of heparin bound to platelet factor 4 occurs in around 1%. 722,738HIT usually occurs after 5 days of treatment with either UFH or LMWHs, and, in severecases, can present with profound thrombocytopenia, thrombosis,or cutaneous necrosis. 13,730,739,740Immediate reactions can occur on the rst dose for previously sensitized patients with HIT, with symptoms including fever, flushing, dyspnea, mental status change, and hypertension.722 Immediate hypersensitivity to protamine has been reported with urticaria, via IgE- and non e IgE-mediated hypotension after rapid infusion of protamine is most likelytriggered by nonspeci c histamine release. 13Protamine is a rare cause of intraoperative anaphylaxis and is most often reported during cardiac surgeries when quick reversal of heparin anti- coagulation is required.531 Cases of delayed hypersensitivity to protamine with erythematous plaques at injection sites can occur to protamine- containing insulin, with 1 report including eosinophilia and renal dysfunction.742,743 Diagnosis. Nonirritating concentrations for the evaluation of immediate hypersensitivity to heparins and heparinoids havebeen reported and shown to be useful in clinical decision FIGURE 7. Biochemical structures of the thienopyridines.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT VOLUME 8, NUMBER 9SBROYLES ET AL S81making.79,726Skin testing is generally performed via PT with commercially available undiluted product. IDTs with 1:10 and 1:100 dilution may be useful, though lower concentrations are associated with lower sensitivity.79The European concentration for heparin is 25,000 units/mL for prick and 2,500 units/mL for IDT, but the highest US concentration is 10,000 units/mL, so PT with 10,000 units/mL and IDT with 1,000 units/mL is recommended. In clinical experience, because cross-reactivitybetween UFH, LMWHs, and heparinoids can occur, it is rec-ommended that a panel of all these products be used during testing. 79 Diagnosis of delayed hypersensitivity to heparins has been reported to be more sensitive when using delayed intradermaltesting at 1:10 dilution compared with patch testing. These are typically read 2 to 7 days after placement. 79,723,744 Testing for IgG antibodies to platelet factor 4 is the mainstay of early diagnosis for HIT when it is suspected clinically, with asensitivity greater than 90% and quick turnaround times. 738 Serotonin release assays remain the criterion standard for HIT diagnosis in terms of speci city, but they are limited by avail- ability, specialized equipment, and longer time to obtain results.738 Immediate hypersensitivity skin testing and serum-speci c IgE testing to protamine have been reported in the literature,but have not been well studied and recommended testing di-lutions vary widely. 530, 728,745Ebo et al629suggest using a maximum undiluted protamine concentration of 50 mg/mL for skin prick testing and 50 mg/mL maximum concentration for intradermal testing. However, a case series using 53 con- trols suggested that intradermal testing at 30 mg/mL may cause nonspeci c histamine release. They suggest skin prick testing at concentrations of 300 to 330 mg / m La n d0 . 0 3t o3 0 mg/mL for intradermal testing.532 Management. Management of heparin sensitivity should focus on choosing an alternative non ecross-reactive agent or desensitization if there is no alternative. Patients with hyper-sensitivity to UFH are often cross-sensitized to LMWHs, and additionally may be sensitized to heparinoids. 722Given that the negative predictive value of heparin and protamine skin testing remains unknown, a high suspicion of clinical reactivity with negative testing still warrants desensitization or if feasible, se- lection of an alternative agent. Generally, patients with bothimmediate and delayed hypersensitivity can tolerate the non- structurally related hirudins, factor Xa inhibitors, but rare pa- tients with structurally dissimilar anticoagulantshave been reported. 722TABLE LXXIX.

The patient successfully tolerated a 50,000 unit bolus of heparin after completing this desensitization and a subsequent smaller dose of heparin. Management of HIT similarly involves immediate cessation of the offending agent, use of alternative anticoagulants, and futureavoidance of both UFH and LMWHs. 739 Because of the nature of its use as a reversal agent, there is little role for desensitization for intraoperative protamine. Manage- ment for these reactions typically focuses on modi cation of operative protocols where it is to be used, because there are noclinically available alternatives to protamine. In the future, theremay be alternatives approved by the FDA; there are already several products in advanced clinical phases. 751 Desensitization to protamine-containing insulin may be necessary for diabetic patients who have no alternatives; this hasbeen described in the literature using the product neutral prot- amine Hagedorn. One protocol successfully describes a startingdose of 0.001 units intradermally, doubling every 20 to 30 mi- nutes until a dose of 0.1 unit is reached. The protocol then continues with subcutaneous injections until they reach the goaldose of 4 units. 752 Coagulation factors (by Craig D. Platt, MD, PhD) General. The use of coagulation factors is the cornerstone of treatment for hemophilia A (de ciency of factor VIII), hemo- philia B (de ciency of factor IX), and type III von Willebrand disease (vWD) (the most severe form of vWD).753,754TABLE LXXXI.

First, inhibitory alloantibodies(predominantly of the isotype IgG) can develop. 755,756Such inhibitors substan- tially increase the risk of morbidity and mortality due toincomplete hemostasis. Second, acute hypersensitivity reactions,often with features of anaphylaxis, can occur with in- fusions. 755,756In some cases, patients simultaneously develop inhibitors and hypersensitivity reactions, a challenging clinical scenario that signi cantly limits treatment options.755,756Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Symptoms of anaphylaxis associated with factor infusion have been mostcommonly described in patients with hemophilia B. Although only 3% to 5% of patients develop inhibitory antibodies, the development of such antibodies is a major risk factor foranaphylaxis. 755-757Warrier et al757reviewed 18 such cases.

His sibling 's symptoms were limited to respiratory distress and back pain.762 Diagnosis. Skin testing protocols have been described for factor XIII ( Table LXXXIV), factor IX (Table LXXXV ), and factor ( Table LXXXIV).762,764,765However, in most cases, IgG alloantibodies are responsible for the reactions and these antibodies are not detected on such testing.755,756Patients with hemophilia B and vWD with documented inhibitory an-tibodies should be considered at risk for anaphylaxis with factor infusions. 755,756Patients with hemophilia A, even those withhigh levels of inhibitors, are not considered at elevated risk of an acute hypersensitivity reaction.755,756 Management. The use of bypassing agents recombinant factor VII activated and activated prothrombin complex concentratesincluding factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity has beendescribed for acute bleeding episodes in patients with hemophiliaA, hemophilia B, and vWD. 766,767Desensitization protocols have been published for all 3 disorders as well ( Tables LXXXVI and LXXXVII ).762-765For patients with inhibitors to these factors, such protocols can be the rst step of an immune tolerance in- duction protocol.762,768It is important to note that nephrotic syndrome is a relatively common complication of immune toler-ance induction in patients with hemophilia B and therefore episodic control with recombinant factor VII activated rather than immune tolerance induction should be strongly considered. 768 OTHER DRUGS Radiographic contrast media (by Knut Brockow,MD) General.

Immediate RCM hypersensitivity re- actions manifest with symptoms of anaphylaxis.771Pruritus and urticaria with or without angioedema are most common.Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominalpain, and diarrhea may occur. Reactions may involve the respi- ratory and cardiovascular systems and present with dyspnea, bronchospasm, and/or a sudden drop in blood pressure. Hypo-tension may be associated with loss of consciousness (anaphy-lactic shock). The onset of immediate hypersensitivity reactions is within 5 minutes after injection in about 70% of reactions 771; 96% of severe or fatal reactions manifest within 20 minutes. Nonimmediate RCM hypersensitivity reactions are usually mild to moderate in severity and are self-limiting. The typical clinical manifestation is a maculopapular exanthem occurringwithin a few hours to several days after administra- tion. 771Uncommon skin immediate hypersensitivity reactions, anaphy- laxis may be con rmed by obtaining blood samples for histamine analysis drawn immediately, or for tryptase ideally drawn 1 to 2hours after the onset of symptoms. The further allergy workup should be performed within 6 months after the reaction for best test results ( Figure 8 ).771It consists of a SPT with undiluted RCM followed by IDT with RCM (300-320 mg/mL) diluted 10-fold in sterile saline and reading after 20 minutes ( Table LXXXVIII ).771 In case of a positive reaction, a panel of several different RCMshould be tested. There is no commercial assay for RCM-speci c IgE antibodies. Increased basophil activation to RCM has been described, but the reliability of this or other in vitro tests has not yet been suf ciently established. Several studies from Europe and Asia have shown that skin testing may be helpful in patients withpast hypersensitivity reactions to RCM. Skin tests with RCM will give positive results only in a minority ( w10%-25%) of imme- diate and 30% to for drug hypersensitivity reactions. 771,772 For nonimmediate exanthems, it is recommended to use SPT and patch tests with undiluted RCM and IDTs with 10-folddiluted products in physiologic saline with delayed readings after 48 and 72 hours (in case of local pruritus or erythematous pla- ques also LXXXVIII ). 771RCM- related T-cell activity may additionally be assessed in vitro by lymphocyte transformation test and by lymphocyte activationtest, although their sensitivity and speci city remain unknown, and these tests are not commercially available. Drug challenge has not been generally recommended because intravenous applications of as low as 1 mL RCM have anec-dotally led to severe anaphylaxis. However, evidence is increasingthat, in experienced centers, challenge tests can be performed to conrm results of skin tests. 773 Graded drug challenge tests have been recommended to con rm negative skin test results, for example, 1/10 of the full dose on day 1, 1/2of the full dose on day 2, and the full dose on day 3 at the radiology department, because a n egative skin test result does indicate, but does not necessarily guarantee, tolerance.769At this time there is inadequate published experience in the pediatric population; therefore, the approach to hypersensitivity to RCM inchildren has been modeled from the one used for adults. Management. Patients with previous hypersensitivity reactions to RCM are at risk for developing new reactions on reexposure.769 If such patients need another contrasted examination, the culpritpreparation should be avoided, particularly if there is a history of severe reactions. In those with positive skin test reaction to the culprit, cross-reactivity to other RCMs is common. 772The risk of RCM cross-reactivity to different RCMs appears to be related to the structure of the culprit. Three different groups of RCM have been proposed, with frequent reactions within groups and scarceskin test positivity among RCMs of different groups. 772In case of a positive reaction, a skin test enegative product should be iden- tied. The preventive value for the selection of an alternative RCM by skin test still has to be further con rmed. The bene ti s limited to those patients with positive skin tests to RCM. In the United States, skin testing after immediate reactions to RCM is not considered standard of care; however, the role of skin tests inthe evaluation is evolving. In 1 study, however, the negative pre- dictive value of reapplication of RCM in combination with skin tests was reported to be high. 773A fractionated challenge test may be considered in nonimmediate exanthems. In patients with negative skin test result or in whom skin tests are not performed, the use of premedication with antihistamines and/or glucocorti-coids is no longer recommended.

Therefore pre-medication may be considered in clinical circumstances associatedwith a high level of perceived risk of anaphylaxis or comorbidities associated with greater anaphylaxis fatality risk (such as underlying cardiovascular disease, use of beta-blockers, or prior severeanaphylaxis), although evidence is lacking to clearly support thispractice and breakthrough reactions may still occur.

The exact incidence is unknown, but hypersensitivity reactionsto corticosteroids have been re ported with an estimated prev- alence of 0.1% to 0.3%. Clinical presentation. Most immediate hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids occur within an hour of adminis-tration. Symptoms may include 1 or more of the following:urticaria, angioedema, wheezing, bronchospasm, nausea,vomiting, hypotension, or even cardiovascular collapse. 775, 776 Recognition of corticosteroids as the culprit for these reactionsis sometimes challenging, because they are often used to treatconditions that may lead to similar symptoms, such as allergic reactions, status asthmaticus, anaphylaxis, or shock. Hence, hypersensitivity reactions to c orticosteroids may go unrecog- nized and patients may develop more than 1 reaction before t h i sd i a g n o s i si ss u s p e c t e d .I ti sn o tc l e a rw h e t h e rs o m et y p e so f corticosteroids are more prone to causing hypersensitivity re-actions than others, or whether the likelihood of reactions isrelated to the frequency of administration of speci cc o r t i c o - steroids. In a recent review of the literature from 2004 to 2014, 120 hypersensitivity reactions t o corticosteroids were reported in 106 patients. Methylprednis olone was implicated in 41% of all types of reactions, followed by prednisolone (20%),triamcinolone (14%), and hydrocortisone (10%). 775, 776Re- actions occur commonly after intravenous (44% of cases) and oral (26%) administration, though reports of reactions after intra-articular, ophthalmic, and topical administrationhave also been published. 775-777 Diagnosis and management of immediate hyper- sensitivity reactions. Identi cation of an alternative cortico- steroid for future use is possible in most cases with skin prick and intradermal testing at noni rritating concentrations ( Table LXXXIX ) a n dg r a d e dc h a l l e n g e .775,776,778-781Whenever possible, testing should be performed with a preservative-free corticosteroid, inaddition to preservative testing if n eeded. Negative sk in test results should be con rmed with drug challenge. 782-800Cross-reactivity patterns based on structural characteristics have not been clearlyestablished for immediate hypersensitivity reactions as they havebeen for delayed reactions as described by Coopman et al. 801-804 Some reports suggested that hydrocortisone is more cross-reactivewith methylprednisolone than with halogenated corti costeroids such as dexamethasone betameth asone, whereas others did not nd a denite pattern of cross-reactivity based on the history and skin and intradermal testing. 802,805,806 Hydrophobic corticosteroids are sometimes chemically bonded to an ester such as sodium succinate or sodium phos-phate to transform them into soluble injectable products. Im-mediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported to the succinate ester component of the corticosteroids. 784,786,804,807- 811Hence, when evaluating a reaction that is thought to be secondary to esteri ed corticosteroids, it is recommended to include the suspected corticosteroids in the skin and intradermal testing, and, in addition, the same corticosteroids without theester component or with a different ester. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions can also occur because of excipients or preservatives in a corticosteroid preparation. Sen-sitivities to or excipients are present in the corticosteroid preparation, skin testing with these agents can beconsidered. Skin testing with milk proteins can be considered in patients with milk allergy reacting to lactose-containing corti- costeroid preparations. Desensitization to methylprednisolone has been successfully performed and is an option when an alternative therapeutic agentcannot be identi ed (Table XC ). 807 Contact dermatitis hypersensitivity) to topical corticosteroidsBackground. Contact dermatitis to topical corticosteroids has been reported with a frequency of 0.5% to 5%.788Contact dermatitis to corticosteroids occurs more frequently in women (3:1 women to men), and among the following occupations:housewife (18%), of ce work (17%), retired (7%), (5%), student (5%), and health care (4%). 795 Diagnosis and management.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used in- hibitors of gastric acid secretion. PPIs are generally well tolerated, with a 1% to 2% risk of minor adverse reactions with rare reports of serious adverse events.822Hypersensitivity is also rarely described.823-825PPIs are modi ed benzimidazoles that contain a pyridine ring unique side-chain substitutions. Omeprazole and pan-toprazole have a methoxy and a di fluoromethoxy chain in their benzimidazole rings, respectively, whereas lansoprazole andrabeprazole have a tri fluoroethoxy and methoxypropoxy chain in their pyridine rings, respectively. Multiple case reports havedescribed possible cross-reactivity among PPIs, based on the underlying structural similarity and con rmed by skin testing. 823,826-828Three patterns of cross-reactivity are described on the basis of combining the data from the most recentliterature. 829 1. Hypersensitivity to omeprazole showed cross-reactivity 2. to showed with pantoprazole, or lansoprazole.824-826 the Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Among the PPIs, lansoprazole, followed by omeprazole, is most frequently impli-cated as the cause of immediate hypersensitivity. 823,824IgE- mediated reactions are most commonly reported, accounting for 86% of all hypersensitivity reactions in a recent review of 118 cases.823In this same review, the clinical manifestations of hy- persensitivity reactions were (listed from most to least frequent) urticaria, generalized itching or pruritus, angioedema, hypoten- breath. mind that,TABLE XCI.

The validity of skin testing for the evaluation of immediate hypersensitivity to PPIs has been studied in a pro-spective analysis by Kepil Ozdemir et al, 824who reported a sensitivity of 58.8%, speci city of 100%, negative predictive value of 70.8%, and positive predictive value of 100%. Theirskin testing protocol is outlined in Table XCII as well as the protocol proposed by Bose et al, 823which is based on a broader literature review. In clinical experience, cross-reactivity among allthe PPIs can be seen. 836Unfortunately, the low negative pre- dictive value of skin testing means that this is often observedduring the oral challenge. The BAT, when used in conjunctionwith skin testing, has been described as being a useful guide forwhether oral challenge should be performed. 837 Patch testing has been used in cases of suspected delayed hypersensitivity.

In the case of severe, life-threatening delayed reactions to PPIs, suchas DRESS and TEN, reexposure to a suspected culprit for testing purposes must be performed with extreme caution and empiric avoidance is recommended. Management. Many patients with hypersensitivity to a PPI can tolerate an alternative PPI, and skin testing (usually to the culprit PPI, and to at least 1 other PPI) followed by oral chal- lenge can identify candidate alternates.838Finally, a successful desensitization protocol omeprazole in the context of imme- diate IgE-mediated hypersensitivity has been published (Table XCIII ).839 Allopurinol (by Alberta L. Wang, MD) General. Allopurinol is the primary therapeutic agent used for the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia. Most allopurinol hy- persensitivity reactions are delayed, with a median time of onset of 3 weeks, but reactions have been reported to occur years after initiation of therapy.840Rash is the most common manifestation of allopurinol hypersensitivity, with an overall incidence of approximately 2%.841SCARs to allopurinol, including DRESS, SJS, and TEN, are rare but have a high associated mortality of up to 27%.842Allopurinol is rapidly metabolized by xanthine oxidase to oxypurinol, which has a half-life of 23 hours, and is excreted bythe kidney. Allopurinol hypersensitivity is primarily mediated CD8\u00feT-cell responses to oxypurinol.843The risk of hypersensitivity reaction is increased by factors that decrease oxypurinol excretion, including impaired kidney function and concurrent diuretic use. The HLA-B*58:01 allele is also associ- ated with an increased risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity.844 There is an increased prevalence of allopurinol hypersensitivity in Asian subpopulations, which has been correlated with higher HLA-B*58:01 allele frequencies. HLA-B*58:01 screening isrecommended for patients of Korean ethnicity with chronic kidney disease stage 3 or worse and patients of Han Chinese or Thai ethnicity irrespective of renal function before initiation ofallopurinol. 845 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. The most com- mon hypersensitivity reaction to allopurinol is a maculopapular exanthem. The incidence of SCARs, including DRESS, SJS, and TEN, is rare ( w0.1%). However, allopurinol users have a 10 times higher relative risk of a SCAR compared with nonusers, and allopurinol is a common cause of SJS and TEN.846,847In addition, systemic hypersensitivity with acute interstitial nephritis has been described in case reports.848,849TABLE XCIV.

Diagnosis is based on clinical history and symptom recognition, in particular, the temporal relationship between allopurinol initiation and symptom onset. Allopurinol skintesting concentrations for IgE-mediated reactions are not stan- dardized or validated. Intradermal skin testing with 0.1 mgo f allopurinol has been reported with negative result in a patient who presented with IgE-mediated symptoms.850Patch testing with allopurinol has also been reported with low sensitivity.842 Drug patch testing for systemic hypersensitivity reactions is notstandardized and the predictive value is unknown. 13 Management. The mainstay of treatment is cessation of allopurinol and supportive care. For patients with a continuedindication for urate-lowering therapy, an alternative agent should be considered. If allopurinol treatment is necessary and the initial hypersensitivity reaction was not severe, desensitization can beperformed on an individual basis weighing the risks and bene ts of treatment. The type and severity of the initial reaction, patientcomorbidity, and urgency of treatment should be consideredwhen choosing a desensitization protocol.In patients with a history of IgE-mediated reaction to allo- purinol, case reports have described success with rapid intrave-nous desensitization. 851In addition, a rapid 2-day oral desensitization protocol with a target dose of 200 mg has been published ( Table XCIV ).852 Published desensitization protocols for DHRs range from 16 to 78 days.13,853,854The standard 28-day oral desensitization protocol ( Table XCV ) is generally well tolerated.853The 28-day protocol balances the reduction of breakthrough reactions during desensitization, such as fever and rash, and the length ofdesensitization. The 28-day protocol reaches a target dose of 100 mg/d. For a target dose higher than this, one can continue to increase the dose up to 2-fold every 3 days as tolerated. Theprotocol can be modi ed with dosage adjustments and by lengthening the time between steps if breakthrough reactionsoccur. In patients who need allopurinol more urgently, a shorter16-day oral desensitization protocol that reaches a target dose of 300 mg can be used ( Table XCVI ). 853A longer 78-day oral desensitization protocol is recommended for high-risk patients who are frail or elderly with multiple medical comorbidities,TABLE XCVI.

Antiepileptics (by Sarah L. Garon, MD, and Elizabeth Phillips, MD) General. Aromatic antiepileptic drugs as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, with a number ofhypersensitivity drug reactions, and a clinical presentation ofbenign, delayed rash is the most common manifestation (ratesranging from 5% to 17%). On the spectrum of potentially severe immunologically mediated adverse drug reactions (IM-ADRs), isolated benign exanthem is most common and mild; however,more SCARs exist, which include DRESS, AGEP, xed drug eruption, and SJS/TEN. 855These SCAR syndromes differ ac- cording to their clinical presentation, morbidity and mortality,time between initiation of the drug and onset of symptoms, immunopathogenesis, HLA and pharmacogenomic associations, and utility of in vivo (patch and delayed prick/intradermal) testing ( XCVIII. immunologically mediated adverse reactions associated with antiepileptic drugs353,868 Drug SJS/TEN.

Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. The term \"anti- convulsant hypersensitivity syndrome \"has been used to encap- sulate the triad of fever, rash, and internal organ involvement, but other features such as lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia arecommonly present. 855This is likely a form of DRESS when anticonvulsant therapy is implicated. In early literature, theclinical cross-reactivity between aromatic amines such asphenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital as high by positive rechallenge reactions. 855In Eu- ropean populations, an estimate of the higher end of risk of this syndrome is 4.5/10,000. Later studies have shown that many severe IM-ADRs associated with aromatic antiepileptic drugs are associated with speci c HLA alleles; however, even before these, case reports suggested a familial predisposition and 10- to 1000-fold overrepresentation of some of the IM-ADRs in speci c ethnicities in which the risk HLA alleles are prevalent.353,856-858 Immediate-type, IgE-mediated symptoms have been described in the literature. Case reports have described urticaria and/orangioedema to oxcarbazapine in 9 pediatric patients, to pheno- barbital in 1 pediatric patient, to carbamazepine in an adult, and tongue angioedema to phenytoin in a child. 859,860Anaphylaxis is rarely reported. It is important to be aware that immediate-typesymptoms may occur, but these are not as frequent as delayed- type drug hypersensitivity reactions. Many of these case reports cannot be validated as truly mediated by IgE. Also, angioedemaor other benign exanthem may be misdiagnosed as IgE-mediated when in fact it may be the presenting cutaneous manifestation of anticonvulsant syndrome. One study examining different appearances of rashes associ- ated with anticonvulsants reported that aromatic anticonvulsantsare with IgE-mediated (immediate) type I and cell-mediated (nonimmediate or delayed) type IV drugTABLE C.

The aro- matic amine anticonvulsants The aromatic amine anticon- vulsants share an aromatic benzene ring and are bySMZ-TMP enzymes to hydroxylated aromatic amine com-pounds (arene oxides). It initially hypothesized that reactive metabolites of these drugs haptenated cellular proteins leading to an antigen-speci c response. More recently, cellular models have supported HLA-restricted, dose-dependent, and noncovalentinteractions between these aromatic amine anticonvulsant drugs and HLA molecules/T-cell receptor. The genetic associations have been strongest for HLA serotype B75 alleles, such as HLA-B*15:02 and carbamazepine SJS/TEN, which are more prevalent in Southeast Asian populations. Since 2007, the FDA has rec- ommended HLA-B*15:02 screening for all patients of known orsuspected Southeast Asian ancestry before initiating carbamaze- pine treatment. A prospective 1-arm study from Taiwan has supported a reduction in the incidence of carbamazepine SJS/TEN in association with HLA-B*15:02 screening. 862,863 Another study from Hong Kong showed that mandated HLA-B*15:02 screening did not result in a reduction in the incidenceof SJS/TEN overall. This is because HLA-B*15:02 testingappeared to lead to displacement of carbamazepine prescribing with the prescription of phenytoin and a subsequent increase in phenytoin SJS/TEN, thus underscoring the fact that providerengagement and education is often necessary for clinical trans- lation. 864HLA risk alleles have had a low ( <5%) positive pre- dictive value for the development of IM-ADRs associated with antiepileptic drugs, suggesting that other factors are important in the immunopathogenesis. More recently, a dominant T-cell re- ceptor clonotype has been found from blister fluid and PBMCs in patients with acute- and recovery-phase carbamazepine SJS/TEN. 353Testing and diagnosis. The utility and cost-effectiveness of HLA screening is currently largely based on the populationprevalence of disease carriage rate of the speci c HLA allele in the population in question and the positive predictive value of theHLA risk allele for the development of the IM-ADR. Thenumber needed to treat to prevent 1 case of IM-ADR can vary from a few hundred to more than 10,000. 353,857Cost-effec- tiveness decisions, however, are also driven by the fact that SJS/ TEN, the most severe of IM-ADRs associated with these aro- matic anticonvulsants, has signi cant long-term morbidity and mortality of up to 50% or higher, particularly in aging pop- ulations.865-867The prevalence of HLA-B*15:02 is 7% to 15% or higher in Southeast Asia and India but less than 1% in populations of European and African ancestry.353HLA-A*31:01 has been associated with carbamazepine exanthem (mac- ulopapular eruption) and DRESS in multiple ethnicities including European. However, the generalizability of an associ- be further clari ed. 353,858,865,867,868Lamotrigine has also been associated with a risk of severe immunologically mediated drugreactions, though it is primarily glucuronidated rather thanoxidized like the other aromatic anticonvulsants. 855Graded dose introduction has been an effective way to reduce the incidence of isolated drug eruptions associated with lamotrigine. Valproic acid and newer structurally disparate anticonvulsants have been safeto administer in patients with reactions to the aromatic antiep- ileptic drugs. However, the risk of a cutaneous reaction is increased with concurrent use of valproic acid and lamotriginebecause of metabolic interactions that lead to an increased elimination half-life of lamotrigine and accumulation of the parent drug. 869 In vivo testing such as patch testing has been used successfully in such studies, showing sensitivity of more than 80%, particu-larly in carbamazepine-associated DRESS in some studies, butsignicantly less than 50% in others. Overall sensitivity for patch testing with antiepileptic drugs varies from less than 20% to more than 80%. 52,870,871Patch tests should be left in situ for 48 hours and ideally read at 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, and 1 week. The vehicle and concentration appear to be important, andTABLE CIII.

Variability in positive results of patch testing with varying concentrations across different anticonvulsants signi es the need for patch testing with several concentrations for accurate results, most commonly 1%, 10%, and 30% of the various antiepileptics in petrolatum. 52,871,872Carbamazepine patch testing appears to be associated with the highest sensitivity, and some studies have been able to show a signi cant cross-reactivity on patch testing between drugs such as carbamazepine and phenytoin.52,871,872 The genetic signi cance of this is still not known because there is a much weaker association between phenytoin SJS/TEN andHLA-B*15:02. From a recent genome-wide association study that included populations from Taiwan, Malaysia, and Japan with phenytoin SJS/TEN/DRESS, a strong association wasidenti ed with a poor of notsigni cantly with genes in the HLA region. 873-875One study showed greater sensitivity of delayed prick and intradermal testing compared with patch testing, but this has not been uni- versally applied.52The lack of commercial availability of sterile intravenous solutions for the aromatic anticonvulsants haslimited the use of intradermal testing for anticonvulsant hyper- sensitivity. 52In addition, prick and intradermal testing have been avoided in very severe reactions such as SJS/TEN because of the rare instances of systemic reactions. Ex vivo andin vitro tests such as ELISpot, lymphocyte toxicity assay, and lymphocyte trans-formation tests for the aromatic anticonvulsant drugs have beenused in the research setting. They currently lack suf cient posi- tive and negative predictive value and have not been qualityassured for clinical use. 353,855,857,876 True immediate reactions (IgE-mediated) to antiepileptic drugs including the aromatic amine anticonvulsants are veryuncommon, and validated skin testing protocols for immediatehypersensitivity reactions to antiepileptics are hence not avail-able. One case study has described successful skin testing to phenobarbital and pentobarbital. For skin testing, 0.1 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL concentrations were nonirritating in both thepatient and control and may be considered. 877Caution is also advised, because on second exposure to the implicated anticon-vulsant drug or a structurally related aromatic amine anticon-vulsant, a reaction that is actually T-cell emediated can appear immediate or accelerated in nature because it is a second-expo-sure memory T-cell response. These reactions are mechanisticallydistinct from IgE-mediated reactions and non eIgE-mediated mast cell activation. Many are potentially severe reactions thatcan be life-threatening with continued dosing of the drugs. Management. Many patients with hypersensitivity to one aromatic anticonvulsant may experience similar symptoms with other cross-reactive aromatic anticonvulsants, but there are alternative agents without this structural similarity. Desensitiza-tion and slow reintroduction protocols exist and are aimed to- ward patients with histories of delayed reactions including mild rashes without accompanying fever, internal organ, mucosal, orsevere skin involvement. 878,879SCAR hypersensitivity reactions should result in discontinuation of the offending drug, anddesensitization protocols should not be performed on these pa-tients. There are a few published desensitization protocols in theliterature to both oxcarbazepine intravenous desensitization topentobarbital have been reported to be successful in hypersensitivity (Table C ). 877,880 Benzodiazepines (by Parul Kothari, MD) General. Benzodiazepines are prescribed for a wide variety of disorders, including anxiety, seizures, insomnia, muscle spasms, and alcohol withdrawal. They act in the central nervous system to enhance the inhibitory effect of g-aminobutyric acid. Because they have the potential to be abused, they are controlled sub-stances regulated by the US Drug Enforcement Agency. They are commonly classi ed as short-, intermediate-, or long-acting, on the basis of their half-life. Structurally, benzodiazepines are composed of benzene and diazepine rings that are fused together. Benzodiazepines differ by their side chains, which can alter their speci c pharmacologic properties. Among the structural differences, alprazolam has a unique triazole ring and tetrazepam a cyclohexene ring. Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Allergic reactions to benzodiazepines are rare, and most of the literature is limitedto case reports and small case series. 882-887Both immediate and delayed reactions have been reported to range in severity from mild to severe, including SJS and TEN. A recent cohort study estimated the cumulative incidence of SJS/TEN to benzodiaze- pines to be 3.76 per million new users.886The most common benzodiazepine implicated in the literature to date has been tetrazepam, which is not available in the United States. Diagnosis. Although diagnostic testing for hypersensitivity reactions to benzodiazepines is not validated, there are reports inthe literature of skin and patch testing to support the diagnosis. Currently, the determination of a benzodiazepine allergy relieson a careful history with attention to objective ndings at the time of the reaction. For midazolam, the maximum nonirritatingconcentration for skin testing has been reported as 1 to 5 mg/mLand 0.25 to 0.5 mg/mL for PTs and IDTs, respectively. 79,888 Management. Given the rarity of allergic reactions to ben- zodiazepines, there are no studies that have evaluated cross-reactivity among members of this class of medication. In a case report of an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to tetraze- pam, the patient had a negative skin test result and tolerated achallenge to diazepam. 885In a case series of delayed cutaneous reactions to tetrazepam, all 9 subjects were tolerant to other benzodiazepines, as demonstrated by negative testing result and/ or challenge.883This was attributed to differences between the structure of tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines. However, others have reported cross-reactivity between tetrazepam and diazepam as well as contact dermatitis to multiple benzodiaze-pines. 884,889If an alternative benzodiazepine is required, one that has been previously tolerated should be used and/or a supervisedoral challenge performed. Currently, there are no desensitizationprotocols for benzodiazepines in the literature. Muscarinic antagonists (by Samantha Minnicozzi, MD) General. Muscarinic antagonists are drugs that bind to muscarinic receptors and inhibit acetylcholine from binding and its subsequent downstream effects. For example, atropine is usedJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT OCTOBER 2020S96 BROYLES myopia and for pupillary dilation and bradycardia, and as an antidote for cholinergic toxicity. Scopolamine is used to prevent nausea during chemotherapy regimens and postoperatively. Glycopyrrolate decreases secre-tions, and is commonly used preoperatively and perioperatively for airway management. Oxybutynin is used to treat patients with bladder dif culties including urge and incontinence. All antimuscarinic agents have wide side-effect pro les depending on which muscarinic receptor is targeted. Commonside effects of antimuscarinic agents include mydriasis, drymouth, tachycardia, agitation, delirium, and hyperthermia. In- fants and children are particularly susceptible to these hyper- thermic effects. A review of topical atropine use found a 1% to 4% risk of minor reactions, with more severe effects observed with intra- venous administration including cardiac arrhythmias. 890,891 Hypersensitivity reactions have rarely been reported, with very few case reports describing atropine and cyclopentolate causing suspected IgE-mediated reactions.892-894 Major symptoms of hypersensitivity. Among the anti- muscarinic drugs, atropine has the largest accumulation of case reports describing anaphylaxis to parenteral and topical formu- lations. In a review of atropine applied topically in pediatric patients for the treatment of myopia, 3.2% developed allergicconjunctivitis, with 0.8% experiencing an allergic dermatitis. 890 In case reports of suspected atropine and cyclopentolate, anaphylaxis symptoms included generalized urticaria, facial and eyelid edema, pruritus, vomiting, and hypotension.892-895 Delayed hypersensitivities and contact allergies to anti- muscarinic agents are another drug-related allergy. In a largestudy evaluating the safety of topical atropine for the treatment ofmyopia in children, up to 0.8% developed a contact allergy. 890 Oral oxybutynin has been implicated in a case of xed drug eruption that continued intermittently over months, coincidingwith the use of oxybutynin, and resolved only once therapy was discontinued. 896 Inhaled antimuscarinic agents are a mainstay in the treatment of COPD. A review of the literature on either asthma or COPD found no case reports of history of inhaled agents such as ipra- tropium or tiotropium causing immediate hypersensitivity re- actions. There was a single case report of a patient with COPDwho developed an intermittent whole-body pruritic rash for several years. 897A biopsy of the rash was consistent with a drug eruption. The patient was initially given a tiotropium inhaler, which was discontinued. Following discontinuation, the patient was started on an ipratropium metered-dose inhaler, after which the rash recurred 3 days later and disappeared 5 days after dis-continuing therapy. The patient continued to develop a similarrash waxing and waning with the use of umeclidinium and aclidinium until all inhaled antimuscarinic therapy was discontinued. 897 Diagnosis. Skin testing for the evaluation of immediate hy- persensitivity to antimuscarinic agents has not been commonly performed and has not been validated on review of the literature. Cavanah and Casale898describe antimuscarinic intradermal skin testing to atropine and scopolamine in 7 healthy volunteers using volumes of 20 nmol and 2 nmol. The solutions used for testing in this protocol were created by diluting either atropine orscopolamine in 0.9% saline, 0.03% human albumin, and 0.4%phenol in water and then buffering the solution to a pH of 6.5 to7.5. All subjects developed a wheal-and- flare reaction to atropine at both doses. 898In comparison, all subjects reacted with a wheal-and- flare response to 20 nmol of scopolamine and none had a response to 2 nmol.898 Fisher and Bowey899performed atropine skin testing as part of their perioperative anaphylaxis evaluation in 10 individuals. Theyperformed skin prick testing using undiluted atropine at a con- centration of 0.6 mg/mL and intradermal testing at a dilution 1:1000. 899Similarly, Cabrera-Freitag et al892performed skin prick and intradermal drug testing to atropine to evaluate a case of anaphylaxis. Atropine was used at a concentration of 1 mg/mL for skin prick testing and a dilution of 0.1 mg/mL for intra-dermal testing. The patient had a positive result on intradermaltesting, with negative intradermal testing result in 10 control subjects. 892 Management. There is little evidence in the literature regarding cross-reactivity in patients with reported allergy to oneantimuscarinic agent and their ability to tolerate other anti- muscarinic agents. The case reports discussing allergic reactionsrecommend avoidance of similar antimuscarinic drugs in the future and do not discuss class alternatives. Desensitization protocols to antimuscarinic agents are yet to be described. Iron (by Anne Liu, MD) General. Intravenous iron is an essential aspect of iron- deciency anemia when side effects or absorption limit the use of oral formulations. Intravenous iron preparations are colloids of iron-carbohydrate nanoparticles that vary by iron core size andtype of surrounding carbohydrate, processed and released as free labile iron. Formulations available in the United States include low-mo- iron iron were discontinued in the United States. Hypersensitivity reactions. Labile plasma iron may pro- duce nonspeci stress and complement activa- tion.900,901Excluding HMW iron dextrans, evidence for immune complex formation and IgE-mediated mechanisms is paltry, and tryptase elevation is exceedingly rare.902,903 Adverse reactions may be infusion rate edependent and typi- cally manifest as dyspnea, chest and/or back pain, acute and myalgias, hypotension, tachycardia, nausea/ vomiting, and pruritus. 904-906Minor reactions usually abate without treatment or with rate reduction and may not recur on rechallenge.905Angioedema and urticaria may signal a distinct reaction type. Severe reactions including anaphylaxis can be fatal. Rarely, delayed reactions may exhibit hypotension, arthralgias/myalgias, malaise, and vomiting. Iron sucrose can uniquely cause peripheral edema and renal injury in a rate- and concentration- related manner. 906,907 Excluding HMW iron dextrans, incidence of serious adverse reactions is less than 1 in 200,000, accounting for approximately0 to 5 deaths per year in the United States. 906,908The high re- action rate and mortality associated with iron dextrans has been attributed to the HMW iron dextran formulation.908-910Limited data suggest iron isomaltoside carries a higher reaction risk than ferric carboxymaltose.911Signicant differences in reaction riskJ ALLERGY 8, NUMBER 9SBROYLES iron sucrose, ferric gluconate, and ferric carboxymaltose.908,912-917 Adverse event reporting initially suggested an increased risk of fatal reactions from ferumoxytol, but randomized comparisons offerumoxytol with iron sucrose and ferric carboxymaltose reported similar rates of adverse reactions. 918-921 Risk factors for severe hypersensitivity reactions include atopy and multiple drug allergies including previous iron hypersensi-tivity reactions. 900,905,922 Diagnosis. Evaluation of an iron reaction should document the speci c product and dose, route, and rate of administration, and include a detailed description of the reaction, treatment, and response. Graded challenge is required only for low-molecular-weight iron dextrans and may not predict serious hypersensitivity re-actions. 922Skin testing has limited utility because most reactions are not IgE-mediated, but it may detect a subset of patients whoare sensitized via typical allergic pathways. A protocol for ferricgluconate skin testing has been used: skin prick at 12.5 mg/mL, and IDT at 0.0125, 0.125, and 1.25 mg/mL at the Brigham and Women' s Hospital. Skin testing to iron sucrose should not be performed, because a permanent tattoo can form from depositionof iron pigment. Management. Table CII outlines suggested reaction treat- ments based on expert panel consensus.916,922Premedication with antihistamines is not advised because of ineffectiveness andside effects. 916,922Switching agents can be considered in patients with mild to moderate reactions, but expert panels adviseavoiding all parenteral iron after a severe reaction. 916Ferric gluconate and iron sucrose, but not ferumoxytol, are consideredalternatives patients sensitive to iron dextran. 902,923,924 Desensitization to HMW iron dextrans has protocols to ferric carboxymaltose and iron sucrose have been reported in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to other iron products.927,928In the Brigham and Women' s Hospital experience, allergists been dif to complete because of treatment-refractory reactions. Iron sucrose desensitization is not done because of poor stability at lower concentrations. Further data are needed to elucidate a role for rapid desensitization after parenteral iron anaphylaxis.
