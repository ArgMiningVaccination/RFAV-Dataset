Despite Akshay Kumar's current reputation of flops and Bollywood's all-time notoriety for delivering below-average sequels, I was excited for this one. Because it's tough to make a film on religious matters, especially in a country that's already struggling for its secular status. And if [Amit Rai's OMG 2](https://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/bollywood/142206-crass-and-gross-amit-rai-shares-challenges-omg-2-faced.html) has managed to repeat the spiritual journey started by Umesh Shukla's OMG - Oh My God! on the big screen, I wasn't going to miss it. In a theatre jam-packed with adults, I put my phone on airplane mode and parked myself on the comfiest recliner seat to not move an inch for the next 2 hours and 36 minutes. I kept waiting to feel the high in the first half as the story built. I couldn't until the \"Har Har Mahadev\" moment arrived. What did the song do? It reached from screen to soul. The music and mantras filled every single person\u2014youngsters, middle-aged, elderly, theists and atheists\u2014in the theatre with energy and faith in something bigger than themselves. The stance of it was so powerful. From that moment on, at every high point in the film, the crowd proudly clapped. No hooting. No abusing. It was no more about Akshay Lord Shiva, Pankaj Tripathi playing Kanti Sharan Mudgal or religion. It was only and only about the content and the point being made. I often don't watch a film in a theatre unless I have full faith in it to bestow a concluding experience on me. So OMG 2, I must say, was the first film in a very, very long time that not only featured cogent content but also attracted an edified audience. Have you ever watched or listened to something so good that you don't want to let go of the aftertaste? The majority of the audience, at least the one I could see, walked out of the theatre with thoughts, music and a high they wished to cherish for days. Good content has that power. With [all the glorious reviews and the record-breaking bandwagon Gadar 2 is on](https://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/bollywood/141581-gadar-2-hysteria-sold-out-single-screen-back-to-the-90s-sunny-deol-stardom.html), I had all the plans to watch it the next day but I chose to stick with this OMG 2 aftertaste a little bit longer. Why? The nexus of spirituality, sangeet and cinema hit all the right notes. The devotional songs in the film reminded me of how we're not the generation that sits through bhajans and kirtans to show our affection for God, but we do feel moved when cinema aligns with mantras Bollywood films have successfully filled people's heart with contentment, faith and assurance simply by reminding them of a higher power. When you do so through music with an intention to influence all humans, the impact is no more limited to one religion, caste, age, culture or language. It becomes spiritual. From here on, anyone who believes in or respects a higher power will feel the energy aka vibrations aka frequency of the song. Spirituality & Youth\u2014Life Controlling To Life Changing , - Bhagavad Gita Not to sound too preachy but the world is divided into two types of people\u2014gyani and agyani. Most people who feel they fall in the former category are usually part of the latter group. \"If you forcefully keep listening to pandits and your family aur unwillingly kabhi is mandir chadati rahi, it will change your vibrations,\" I overheard a girl during a dinner date with my family. She's not all gyani but I've not heard a statement this relatable in a long time. Spirituality is too personal. More personal than any secret you've ever kept, any pain that you've ever endured. It goes right as deep as your soul. This so-called rebellious generation that seems to be sailing away from religion might actually be swimming toward spirituality. A lot of us consciously or subconsciously believe spirituality to be so sacred that we aren't willing to share it. I might donate something on my own when the calling is from within but the moment someone else asks me to do the same, I become detached from the very task. It suddenly feels impersonal to send a namaskar on WhatsApp to please a family member who sent a mandir ka chitra when you know you've been praying to the higher power, talking to the universe every instance. And one's experience of spiritual music or Bollywood devotional songs featuring mantras and high-frequency tunes too is one's own. Spirituality, Sangeet & Frequencies\u2014Mind Mollying Drug As per Hindu mythology, Naadbrahma (Brahma as Sound) is the first-ever sound that was present and apparent throughout the universe and is believed to be unstruck. Another myth states that the Tandava of Shiva and Onkar are the origin of the sound. The mythology says that music came to the earth from heaven and Sage Narada played a key role in it. And since its inception, music has been operating as an instrument to digest information across all cultures and for everything that's alive. But its relationship with healing and emotions is more scientific than religious. According to [a 2022 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1744388122000354), spiritual singing and movements are effective in dealing with mental health concerns. In 2019, Sonya Joseph, a student at the American College Of Healthcare Sciences, wrote her thesis on the subject of healing frequencies and published it in [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333852911_Sound_Healing_using_Solfeggio_Frequencies). Her concluding statement stated, \"Sound healing is effective in healing DNA physical, generational and emotional trauma using vibrations and frequencies.\" For the unversed, there are nine solfeggio frequencies\u2014ranging from 174 Hz to 963 Hz\u2014that are used for sound healing and many others that are comforting. [174 Hz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxOw3Zy_GxA) - Relieving pain and stress [285 Hz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O275wnurMEQ) - Healing tissue and organs [396 Hz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8LtQzM_gqg) - Liberating guilt and fear [417 Hz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQK5_hENKWU) - Undoing situations and facilitating change [528 Hz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTPnwiCzAs8) - Transformation and miracles [639 Hz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5T_QxR8aclQ) - Connecting relationships [741 Hz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dk04sX-qCE) - Awakening intuition [852 Hz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSs-44PVWzc) - Returning to spiritual order [963 Hz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wmuqOdmqAc) - Divine consciousness or enlightenment Many musicians compose on these healing tones, John Lennon's \"Imagine\" for example. You can hear some of these as you enter a spa, a meditation centre or a hotel lobby. The sound of temple bells ranges from 500 Hz to 2600 Hz based on their size and metal. It helps clear your mind, improve concentration and alert you while emptying your brain of all negative thoughts. All devotional Bollywood songs may not feature these healing frequencies but they are composed at higher vibrations. Such music boosts your energy, picks it up to a greater wavelength even if it is only for a few minutes. The higher your vibrational frequency is, the lighter you will feel. This is when you experience acceptance, love, joy, peace, happiness and enlightenment. The lower the vibrational frequency is, the heavier you will feel. This is when you experience shame, guilt, anger, desire, pride, grief and fear. If you feel troubled and unsettled and truly wish to reap the healing benefits of these God-given frequencies, take out a few minutes every day to meditate on the right vibrations. Have patience. It may not work as quickly as an allopathic medicine or magic, but slowly and steadily, it'll calm you. If your goal is to be happy, your goal actually is to live on the higher vibrational frequencies. You could do it by indulging in physical activity, meeting friends and loved ones or through music. Until then, as Akshay Kumar says, \"Rakh vishwas, tu hai Shiv ka das.\" Please note: The music and frequencies suggested in the article are not a replacement for any treatment.
