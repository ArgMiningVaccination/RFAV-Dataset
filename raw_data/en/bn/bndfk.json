What Is Mindfulness Meditation? Mindfulness meditation has been around for centuries, but it is only recently that it has been used as a form of therapy. Mindfulness meditation is the practice of paying attention to the present moment without judgment. It can be practiced in a seated or standing position. When you are first starting, it may be helpful to have a guided meditation. Guided meditations can be found online or in meditation apps. There are many benefits to mindfulness meditation. Some of the benefits include: - Improved focus and concentration - Reduced rumination and worry - Increased self-awareness - Enhanced sleep quality - Increased immune system function - Reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety Mindfulness meditation can be a helpful tool for teens who are struggling with mental health issues. It can help them to focus on the present moment and to find peace and calm. Mindfulness meditation can also help them to develop self-awareness and to learn how to deal with difficult emotions in a healthy way. Additional Programs at Imagine Seattle In addition to our meditation therapy program, our team also provides other programs so that teens in our care receive the right level of treatment for them. Our Imagine Seattle team also offers: - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) - In our teen CBT program, adolescent clients are encouraged to identify and evaluate their negative thoughts about themselves, the world, and their future. By leading young people down this path, therapists can help clients start to feel better emotionally and begin to behave more functionally as they develop the ability to think more realistically about their current situation and the potential they have for a brighter future. - Trauma therapy - The trauma therapy program at Imagine Seattle ensures that your adolescent knows that they are not alone and that their trauma and the related emotional turmoil suffered is valid. Additionally, our program asserts that your teen can and will overcome a traumatic past to live a happier, healthier life into adulthood. - Family therapy - Our family therapy program is a psychological counseling approach that can assist with improving communication between family members, both young and old. Additionally, through our family counseling sessions, Seattle families can learn to resolve conflicts that exist today and develop the tools needed to stave off disputes in the future. - Co-occurring disorders -Many teenagers diagnosed with a mental health disorder are found to also be struggling with more than one disorder. This is referred to as a dual diagnosis and requires the professional help found in the co-occurring disorder treatment program at Imagine Seattle.
