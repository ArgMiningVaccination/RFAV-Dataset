Acupuncture is a type of therapy incorporated within Oriental Medicine. Complimentary services often used with acupuncture include specific exercises, physical therapy, and herbology. Acupuncture is a practice based on Eastern philosophies and is incorporated within Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). In TCM, there are 12 meridians along the body with points, then when stimulated, can improve the energetic balance of important organs and functions of the body. While acupuncture with needs involves the use of very fine sterile needles, needless acupuncture may rely upon magnets, electricity, and laser to engage one or more acupoints. What Can Patients Expect? An initial acupuncture session includes an initial assessment and discussion, followed by an initial treatment with or without needles. Stimulation of acupoints may occur on various areas of the body, including the ears and feet. Unfamiliar feelings may be triggered during a session. These feelings generally disappear after a treatment session. Who Can Benefit from Acupuncture? Traditional uses of acupuncture have addressed a range of issues in patients, including anxiety, depression, infertility, chronic pain and more.
