Black Mustard Seed for Chakra Healing Black Mustard Seed is prescribed for treating imbalances of the Root, Solar Plexus, and Third Eye Chakras. The Root Chakra is the first chakra also sometimes known as the Base Chakra, the red chakra, or Muladhara. It is located at the base of the spine and controls the kinesthetic energy for feeling and movement. It is the foundation of physical energy and spiritual energy for the body. It governs stability, security, and is the source of our survival instinct. It keeps us connected to the earth. When the Root Chakra is physically out of balance the symptoms will manifest themselves as lethargy, feeling down, low levels of activity, low enthusiasm, and a need for constant stimulation. You may experience lower back pain, suffer from leg pain, or have immune system issues. When the spiritual energies of the Root Chakra are out of balance, you will feel flighty, disconnected from reality, and distant. You may lack self-identity and have insecurity. You may begin to doubt your beliefs, stop being loyal to those around you, or find yourself deriving little joy from physical pleasures. You will also likely have a lack of motivation and drive. A balanced root chakra will help you live in the present moment by grounding you to the earth. By being stable, your vitality and physical strength will improve along with your integrity and self-esteem. You will be stress-free, feel courageous, be more passionate, motivated, confident to take on life's challenges. The Solar Plexus Chakra is the energy distribution center, the first of the chakras of relationships. This chakra is located between the ribcage and navel. It controls the immune system and digestive systems. When in balance physically, you have strength to fight infections, are free of allergic reactions, and are able to use the nutrients you ingest. When it is out of balance physically you will have low tolerance to infection, suffer from hormone disorders, or have low tolerance for many foods. Spiritually, when the solar plexus is in balance you are free to interpret the world through your own thoughts and emotions and not live in fear of violating the dictums of others. When the solar plexus is out of balance spiritually you will feel fear: fear of the displeasure of others, and disappointing others, or fear of subordinating your life and pleasures to the will of others. You will have confidence and make strong, intentional decisions. You will let your intuition guide in the direction of spiritual growth and progress. The Third Eye Chakra is the center of perception and command. It directs our sight and everyday awareness of the world. Our consciousness is located here. This is the chakra that controls how we see ourselves and the external world. When the Third Eye Chakra is in balance, we can see clearly and understand what we see. This is our 'intuition center' so to speak. We are able to interpret visual cues and our awareness level is high. When it is out of balance or blocked you will find yourself confused, difficulty seeing clearly, and a hard time differentiating what is important and what is not. You may feel as if you do not have command of your thoughts. Physical symptoms can include headaches, ear aches, and vision problems. Fear not though, even if your third eye chakra is blocked or out of balance, indigo colored crystals can make it better.

Black Mustard Seed and the Goddess Black Mustard Seed is sacred to Hecate, the Greek Goddess of magic and witchcraft, Ma'at, Egyptian goddess of truth and justice, and Kali, Hindu Goddess of Time. Hecate is the Greek chief goddess of magic, witchcraft, the night, the moon, ghosts, necromancy, and spells. She is the daughter of the Titan, Perses, and the nymph, Asteria. Hecate was believed to have power over heaven, earth, and sea, therefore, bestowing wealth and prosperity to those who pray to her. She is also the goddess of crossroads and doorways, a guardian against evil spirits. In earlier texts, she is depicted as a single female figure wearing a long-clad robe, holding burning torches in each hand. Later depictions show her in her most popularized form, that of the triple-formed goddess, which consisted of three goddesses standing back to back, most likely so she could watch all directions of the crossroads that she guarded so diligently. Hecate, in her triple-form, was also accompanied by barking dogs, her familiars. Ma'at is the Egyptian Goddess of truth, cosmic balance, justice and order. In ancient depictions, she is often pictured with an ostrich feather atop her head. Although it is unknown why the Egyptians chose the ostrich feather as a symbol for Ma'at, many historians believe that it may be due to its associations with balance and equity. (11) Ma'at was very significant in Egyptian culture for she was the goddess who kept the Universe in balance, encouraging Egyptians to live a life of morality and justice. She also presided over the Hall of Judgments, which, according to Egyptian Mythology, was the place that every soul had to pass through to get to the afterlife. In the Hall of Judgment, a person's heart was weighed in a scale against Ma'at's ostrich feather. If the deceased person's heart balanced with Ma'at's feather (the 'feather of truth'), they could continue their journey to the Afterlife. If not, their journey ended. In some texts, it was believed that Osiris, God of the Afterlife, placed the heart on a great golden scale and, if it was imbalanced, he consumed the heart. This tradition influenced the daily actions of the ancient Egyptians. Kali is the goddess of time, creation, and death. She is often misunderstood by Western culture due to her violent and bloody physical depiction. She is often painted with red eyes, blue-black skin, partially or completely naked, with a long lolling tongue, multiple arms, a skirt or girdle of human arms, a necklace of decapitated heads, and a decapitated head in one of her hands. Without understanding, one may be fearful of this warrior goddess, but Kali is actually a representation of action, the decimation of the ego, and the wholeness of existence. Kali transcends both good and evil, teaching us that the lines between what we deem 'right' and 'wrong' are not definite and unchanging, but rather these notions are nebulous and ill-defined. Kali is also a symbol of motherly love and shakti- the embodiment of feminine energy, creativity and fertility. She is often associated with Shiva, God of Fertility and Power, as one of his consorts. She plays an opposite role to that of Parvati. While Parvati soothes Shiva, neutralizing his destructive tendencies, Kali actively provokes and encourages him. In the 20th century, Kali has become geographically and culturally marginal, growing to become a symbol of feminine empowerment and sexual liberation in Western culture.

This parable is about a mother who loses her child. She seeks out the Buddha for help, asking him if he will bring her son back to life. The Buddha agrees on condition that she gathers a mustard seed from the village. \"But,\" the Buddha told her, \"you must get the seed from a house that has not known death.\" The woman was elated for mustard seeds very common. She went from house to house, all of which had mustard seeds, however, each family had experienced death in their families. As she talked with the villagers, she came to the realization that she was not alone in her grief. Others had experienced what she was going through. \"No house is free from death,\" she realized. She finally let go of her son, laying him in a forest nearby, and returned to the Buddha. The Buddha asked her, \"Do you have the mustard seed?\" \"Dear teacher,\" She replied, \"I do not, but I saw that the living are few and the dead are many.\" There is another Parable of the Mustard Seed in the New Testament of Christianity wherein Jesus describes the Kingdom of God as like a mustard seed in that it is tiny, but grows into a great tree. Jewish scholars compare the knowable universe to the mustard seed to demonstrate its insignificance- how can we think so highly of ourselves when we are so small, and part of small things? In Islamic faith, the adth recounts Muhammad warning that a person with even a mustard seed's worth of pride in their heart would not be able to enter Paradise. The witches' scene in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" describes a concoction that consists of \"Eye of newt and toe of frog, Wool of bat and tongue of dog...\" Luckily, these terms refer to plants, not actual animal parts. Eye of newt is a pseudonym for black mustard seed. by Nicole Farmer Nicole is the resident Tarot Master at Crystal Inner Circle.
