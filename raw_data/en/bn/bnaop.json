In our Study on Integrative Medicine Treatment Approaches for Pain (SIMTAP), we observed the impact of an integrative approach on chronic pain and a number of other related patient-reported outcome measures. Methods: Our prospective, non-randomized, open-label observational evaluation was conducted over six months, at nine clinical sites. Participants received a non-standardized, personalized, multimodal approach to chronic pain. Validated instruments for pain (severity and interference levels), quality of life, mood, stress, sleep, fatigue, sense ofcontrol, overall well-being, and work productivity were completed at baseline and at six, 12, and 24 weeks. Blood was collected at baseline and week 12 for analysis of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Repeated-measures analysis was performed on data to assess change from baseline at 24 weeks. Results: Of 409 participants initially enrolled, 252 completed all follow-up visits during the 6 month evaluation. Participants were predominantly white (81%) and female (73%), with a mean age of 49.1 years (15.44) and an average of 8.0 (9.26) years of chronic pain. At baseline, 52% of patients reported symptoms consistent withdepression. At 24 weeks, significantly decreased pain severity ( 23%) and interference ( 28%) were seen. Significant improvements in mood, stress, quality of life, fatigue, sleep and well-being were also observed. Mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels increased from 33.4 (17.05) ng/mL at baseline to 39.6 (16.68) ng/mL at week 12. Conclusions: Among participants completing an integrative medicine program for chronic pain, significant improvements were seen in pain as well as other relevant patient-reported outcome measures. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01186341 Keywords: Integrative medicine, Chronic pain, Patient-reported outcomes, Complementary therapies, Musculoskeletal disorders Background A 2011 Institute of Medicine report, Relieving Pain in America , estimates that chronic pain affects nearly 116 million American adults, a staggering number that sur- passes those affected by heart disease, cancer, and diabetescombined [1]. The report concludes that chronic pain costsbetween $560 billion and $635 billion annually in medical expenses and lost productivity. Although there have beensome therapeutic advances, m any patients with chronic pain become resistant to conventional medical treatments or suffer adverse effects from widely used prescription med-ications with high addictive pot ential, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or opiates. For these reasons, patients with chronic pain f requently seek to integrate complementary therapies, often without the knowledge of their primary care provider [2-4]. * Correspondence: dabrams@hemeonc.ucsf.edu 1UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, University of California San Francisco, 1545 Divisadero Street, 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94115, USAFull list of author information is available at the end of the article \u00a9 2013 Abrams et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2013, 13:146 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/13/146Integrative medicine provides patient-centered care and addresses the full range of physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and environmental influences that affect aperson 's health [5]. Employing a personalized strategy that considers the patient 's unique conditions, needs, and circumstances, integrative medicine uses the mostappropriate interventions from an array of scientific disciplines to heal illness and help people regain and maintain optimum health. Beca use integrative medicine is a \"whole systems \"approach that employs multiple modalities in concert as opposed to an isolated complementary therapy, studying outcomes is more challenging thanevaluating an isolated pharmaceutical or botanical inter- vention. Chronic pain is one of the main reasons patients seek care at integrative medicine clinics [6,7]. In an effort to capture data on patient-reported out- comes in integrative medici ne, a number of leading in- tegrative medicine clinics have collaborated to formthe first practice-based research network in the field: the Bravewell Integrative Medicine Research Network (BraveNet). BraveNet 's initial project was to characterize 4182 patients seeking care at nine clinical sites in a system- atic fashion by collecting information at a single time point [6]. This repository of data confirmed the highutilization of integrative medicine by chronic pain patients and informed the present Stu dy on Integrative Medicine Treatment Approaches for Pain (SIMTAP). We reportthe impact of a six-month integrative approach on chronic pain and a number of other related patient-reported outcome measures. Methods Design overview Using a prospective, non-randomized, open-label observa- tional design, we assessed patients at baseline and six-, 12-, and 24-week visits. At baseline, participants completeda demographic questionnaire as well as the instruments utilized to assess outcomes over the duration of the study. Within a week of each projected follow-up data collectionvisit, participants were asked to complete the battery of questionnaires collected at baseline. Information on inte- grative interventions, prescription medications, and vita-mins and supplements utilized was collected at each study visit. Questions about integrative modalities being utilized were answered at weeks six, 12, and 24 to define the scopeof the interventions received. Setting and participants Eligible patients were enrolled at each of the nine BraveNet clinical sites. Participants were clinic patients aged 18 or older who were seeking their initial treatment at the centerfor chronic pain, defined as pe rsisting for at least the past three months with an average level over the past month of at least 4 of 10 on a numerical rating scale. Participantsprovided written informed consent before initiation of any study-related procedures. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each participating siteincluding Allina Health Institutional Review Board; Beth Israel Medical Center Human Subjects Protection Office Institutional Review Board; Duke University HealthSystems Institutional Revi ew Board; The Scripps Clinic Institutional Review Board; Thomas Jefferson University Division of Human Subjects Protection; University ofCalifornia Los Angeles Institutional Review Board; University of California San Francisco Committee on Human Research; and University of Maryland Institutional Review Board. Intervention In keeping with the integrative medicine philosophy of individualized patient-centered care, no standardized prespecified clinical intervention for chronic pain wasprescribed for all study partici pants. Instead, practitioners at each of the network sites devised treatment plans for participating chronic pain patients. All BraveNet sitesinclude integrative physicians , acupuncturists, mindfulness instructors, and yoga instructors; some also incorporate massage therapists, manual me dicine therapists, fitness/ movement specialists, dietician/nutritionists, psychologists, healing touch therapists, and o ther energy practitioners. Outcomes and follow-up The battery of validated outcome measurements collected at each visit included the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) [8],the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12v2) [9], the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (AIOS) [12], Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) survey [13]. In addition, numerical rating scales were utilizedto assess fatigue, restfulness of sleep, and sense of con- Venipuncture for determ ination marker of inflammation)and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (potentially associated with pain syndromes) was performed at baseline and week 12. Statistical analysis An objective of this network study was to demonstratethat the sites could enroll and follow patients over a 24-week period and collect serial laboratory specimens. For this analysis, we focus on thos e participants who completed the entire 24-week program. A post hoc sensitivity analysis was performed to determine potential differences be- tween enrolled patients completing all four study visits(\"completers \") and those who completed at least the baseline visit but not the entire study ( \"noncompleters \"). Comparisons of baseline characteristics were assessedAbrams et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2013, 13:146 Page 2 of 9 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/13/146utilizing t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical measures. Descriptive statistics were s ummarized using frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables. Means, standard deviations, medians, quartiles, minimums, and maximums were reported for all continuous variables. Pain and quality-of-life scales Repeated-measures analyses of variance were performed onstudy completers to detect changes in BPI subscales \u2014Pain Severity and Interference \u2014over time as well as changes in quality-of-life scores. Resu lts are summarized with a point estimate of mean change in the outcome measures between baseline and any specified follow-up visit with 95% confi- dence intervals. Pvalues are reported for overall model summary, indicating any difference between any two given points between baseline and 24 weeks. If the Pvalue was significant (<.05), follow-up linear regression analyses were done to verify that the trends were consistent in direction throughout all study visits, indicating constant improve- ment or decline from visit to visit. A secondary sensitivity analysis was done to determine the impact of including only study completers for the primary outcome \u2014BPI Pain Severity and Interference scores \u2014instead of using the more conservative method of last observation carried forward. The repeated-measures analysis for the BPI Pain Severity and Interference scoreswas run on three subgroups of the sample assuming that values at missed visits were carried forward from the last nonmissing study visit: (1) all e nrolled patients, (2) patients completing at least one postbaseline study visit, and (3) patients completing all f ollow-up study visits. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to look at variables that influenced the pain response. Responders were defined as those with at least a 20% decrease in the BPI interference score over 24 weeks.Variables included in the model were age, gender, ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic), years with chronic pain, body mass index, and baseline values for the BPI interferencescore, SF-12 physical component score, SF-12 mental component score, CES-D score, and PSS-4. Lab measures (hs-CRP and Vitamin D) We used dependent t-tests to determine whether the 12- week study visit laboratory measures differed significantlywhen compared to baseline values. A Pvalue of < .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Results A total of 409 participants we re consented and enrolled at the nine BraveNet sites between June 2009 and November2010. The number of participants contributing baseline data per site ranged from 22 to 65 (median: 49). Of the participants, 252 completed all study assessmentsduring the 24-week study and are the basis of our pri- mary analysis. Table 1 provides baseline demographics of the study completers compared with those who did not contribute data at the 24-week visit. Regardless of completion status, the majority of the participants were women, onaverage nearly 50 years of age and slightly overweight, who reported experiencing pain for about nine years (completers) or seven years (noncompleters). Other thanthe duration of pain, completers and noncompleters were similar in demographics and baseline scores on all patient-reported outcomes measured. Subsequent resultsare presented for the completers only. Fifty-one percent of the participants reported pain in the neck, 49% lumbar spine, and 23% foot. Multiple sites could be selected. At week 24, participants were receiving a wide range of modalities in their presc ribed integrative suite of therapies (see Table 2). Figure 1 is a mosaic plot of themodalities utilized over the course of the study. The highest number of patients received 4 modalities (N = 55), including medicine (51.9%), (1.9%), and alternative medical systems therapy (5.8%).Overall, acupuncture/Chine se medicine, manipulation therapy, and mind/body therapy were the most commonly received modalities.

Dietary supplements used by more than 10% ofparticipants at week 24 included vitamin D (81%), fish oil (65%), magnesium (32%), green tea (24%), and turmeric (13%). The only changes from baselinein proportion of patients us ing supplements were seen in vitamin D, magnesium, and glucosamine (55%, 27%, and 26% at baseline, respectively). The mean monthlycost of supplements increased from $47 at baseline to $72 at week 24. Pain scores The BPI is composed of four items that assess pain severity and an additional seven questions that assess how the paininterferes with life [8]. The composite score summarizes the patient pain experience over the past 24 hours, with 1-4r a t e da sm i l d ,5 -6 moderate, and 7 -10 severe. The mean baseline severity and interference scores in our cohort were 4.7 (1.86) and 4.7 (2.53), respectively. The overall model results for all three subgroups in both BPIseverity and BPI interferen ce scales were statistically significant ( P< .001). Additionally, mean change scores between baseline and any specific post-baseline study visitfor both BPI scales were significantly decreased ( P<. 0 0 1 ) . Figure 2 portrays the change in BPI scores over the study duration. Mean severity scores decreased 23% frommoderate to mild at 24 weeks. Interference scores dropped 28% to a mean of 3.3 at week 24. Depression, stress, and quality of life Fifty-two percent of completers scored 16 or greater on the CES-D at baseline, consistent with symptoms of de-pression. As seen in Table 3, by week 24 the mean score had dropped from 17.9 to 13.8 (median score decreased from 16.0 to 11.0); at week 24, only 35% had scoresconsistent with depressive symptoms. Although both the mental and physical component scores on the SF-12v2 remained below the U.S. norm of 50 at week 24, themean mental component score rose from 43.5 at baseline to 46.5, and the mean physical component score rose from 3 7 . 7a tb a s e l i n et o4 1 . 5a tw e e k2 4( P< .001). Similarly, stress and fatigue decreased over time, and the participants ' sense of control increased (all P< .001). The AIOS asks participants to summarize their sense of well-being for the entire month by marking a point on a plain line with an \"X\"somewhere between \"Worst you have ever been \"and\"Best you have ever been. \"Participants ' sense of well-being increased significantly from a baseline mean of 41.7 to 55.9 at week 24 ( P< .001). To put these values in context, rehabilitation center patients scored anaverage of 33 and healthy controls a 61 on the AIOS [12]. Work productivity The WPAI survey assesses the impact of an intervention with respect to daily activity and productivity [13]. It has been previously validated that overall work productivity issignificantly related to general health perceptions. The WPAI survey was completed by the 145 participants who reported having employment. The results (see Table 4)demonstrate improvement in all parameters over the 24-week study period. Laboratory studies Specimens for hs-CRP and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were obtained at baseline and at week 12. Mean hs-CRPdecreased from 4.0 (10.21) mg/L at baseline to 2.7 (6.55) mg/L at 12 weeks. The mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level at baseline was 33.4 (17.05) ng/mL. At week 12, the mean value had increased to 39.6 (16.68) ng/mL ( P< .001). Considering >30 range for 25-hy droxyvitamin D, 52% of the participants were in the desirable range at baseline, and 70% were at week 12 [14]. Predictors of response A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that patients with fewer years of chronic pain (p = 0.03), non-Hispanic populations (p = 0.04), and those with higher (worse) baseline BPI interference scores (p = 0.002) and SF-12 physical component scores (p = 0.008) were morelikely to have a clinical meaningful response (i.e. 20 decrease in the BPI interference score over 24 weeks). Age, gender, BMI, baseline SF-12 mental componentscore, CES-D score, and PSS-4 score were not significant predictors of response. Discussion and conclusion The initial project of the BraveNet practice-based research network involved collection of a one-time questionnaireTable 2 Current integrative medicine pain treatments at completers 252) Integrative 11.1%Integrative Medicine Consult 25 10.3%Exercise 12 4.9%Yoga 6 Medical 6 2.5%Energy Therapy 1 0.4% aIndividual integrative medicine modalities were grouped into eight categories.

BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2013, 13:146 Page 4 of 9 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/13/146from about 500 participants at each of our nine clinical sites [6]. Building on the initial experience of collecting data as a multi-site group, SIMTAP demonstrated our ability to enroll participants and capture outcomes in a prospective longitudinal study, requiring serial follow-updata collection at three time points beyond baseline as well as the ability to collect and process laboratory specimens. The establishment of this functioning practice-based re-search network in integrative medicine is one of the main accomplishments of this endeavor. We surpassed the target enrollment of 400, with 409 participants ultimately enrolled. Of these, 88 (21.5%) did not contribute data at the six-week study visit. At 24 weeks, 66% of the enrolled participants were availablefor follow-up. Chronic pain trials frequently encounterretention issues for a number of reasons, including the nature of the population. It has been suggested that in a typical 12-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled trial, a dropout rate of 20% -50% is to be expected [15]. Our participants received no financial incentives for theirparticipation in the 24-week study and, in fact, were responsible for the cost of their integrative treatments.

Acknowledging the need to improve retention, we conclude that within the context of chronic pain intervention trials, the practice-based research networkis successful in recruiting and retaining patients who Figure 1 Mosaic plot of Modalities received by Patients.

Our study demonstrates that an integrative approach to treating chronic pain had a significant impact on pa- tients 'pain as well as on associated symptoms and quality of life. This success was in the context of long-standing chronic pain, with an average duration in our sample of greater than eight years. Whereas conventional medicalinterventions, such as pharmaceu ticals or surgery, generallyfocus on one outcome, integrative interventions have the potential to affect multiple aspects of health and well-being [17]. It has been recommended that additional patient- recorded outcome measures are also important to monitor, particularly in studies of chronic pain [18]. The trends in decreased pain, stress, depression, and fatigue, and im-provement in physical quality of life and overall well-being, were consistent over the 24-week duration of the trial and suggest the possibility of sustainable effects of the integra-tive interventions [19]. Particularly notable is the decrease Figure 2 Repeated-measures analysis of primary outcome: Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) pain scores. Reported Pvalues are overall model results summarizing any potential change across four time points throughout the study. Individual estimated change from baseline scores specify changes in scores from baseline to any designated study visit on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating least possible pain or interference.

In addition, findings on the WPAI survey sug-gest that the improvements measured in patient-reported outcomes also translated into greater productivity at work. Predictors of response to an integrative medicine approachincluded years of chronic pain, ethnicity, and baseline BPI interference and SF-12 physical component scores. We investigated hs-CRP as a general marker of in- flammation rather than as a predictor of cardiac risk [20,21]. The mean hs-CRP value declined one point, suggesting a trend toward decreased inflammation. Ina previous study on musculoskeletal pain conducted at our Minneapolis BraveNet site, 93% of the participants were found to have insufficient levels of 25-hydroxyvitaminD(20 ng/mL) [22]. To further assess the relationship of hypovitaminosis D to pain, we included vitamin D levels in SIMTAP. Our patients presented with baseline vitaminD levels higher than those seen in the prior study and in the average American adult [21,23]. This likely reflects awareness among both patients and practitioners of theincreasing importance of adequate vitamin D levels. The findings that 70% of SIMTAP participants had values greater than 30 ng/mL and none were deficient at week 12 reflectthe serious attention paid to maintaining sufficient vitamin D in integrative medicine practices. Limitations One limitation of this study is the loss to follow-up. Our re- sults describe the outcomes of 252 participants at nine siteswho completed all study visits during the 24-week integra- tive medicine intervention for chronic pain. It could be argued that these completer s were somehow different from the noncompleters, skewing the final study results, although this notion is not supported by the sensitivity analysis. The bulk of patients lost failed to return for the first studyfollow-up at week six. This may represent patients who were \"shopping \"for a new approach for their chronic pain, visited one of the centers, enrolled in SIMTAP, and then chose notto return for follow-up care. The 252 completers can be considered as being treated \"on protocol \"for analysis in this prospective non-randomized open-label intervention.A second limitation is the absence of a control group. It could be argued that the significant benefits we observed in SIMTAP participants may have nothing to do with theintegrative intervention per se. Because we did not control for natural history and the passage of time, we cannot estimate what proportion of the observed benefits wouldhave occurred separately from the intervention themselves. Without a control group of equal attention, it could be ar- gued that the benefits observed were related to the degreeof attention participants received at our centers. Because one of our goals was to assist in the development of our practice-based research network and to demonstrate thatwe could recruit, follow, and retain participants, as well as collect and process laboratory specimens, we opted not to include randomization or comparison to a control groupin our design. In the spirit of the individualized care that characterizes the integrative medicine appr oach to the unique individual, we did not mandate a standardized intervention for all SIMTAP participants. Althoug h this makes it more difficult to define the precise treatment that patients received,the network felt that the per sonalized treatment plan was preferred. Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine generally devise individualized treatment plans basedon each patient 's unique diagnosis rather than follow a standard intervention based on the complaint. In a seminal randomized controlled trial of Chinese herbalmedicine for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, investigators compared a standard and an individualized Chinese herbal formulation to a placebo [24]. Resultsshowed that compared with patients in the placebo group, patients in the two active treatment groups had improve- ments in bowel symptoms as rated by both the patientsand their gastroenterologists at the end of the 16-week intervention. However, at follow-up 14 weeks after com- pletion of the treatment, only the individualized herbalmedicine treatment group maintained improvement. Future directions The results of SIMTAP suggest that the tailored, multi- modal approach to treating chronic pain combining con- ventional and complementary therapies improves qualityTable 4 Work productivity and activity impairment survey measures by study visita Measure Baseline 6-week study visit12-week study visit24-week study visitMean change from baselinePvalueb Absenteeism 7.8 ( N= 145); values per study visit shown are means (SD); mean 24-week change from baseline values from repeated-measures analysis. bPvalue indicates significant change from baseline and 24-week study visit if < .05; obtained from repeated-measures analysis. cIndicates improvement in health.Abrams et al.

The components of integrati ve medicine that contrib- ute to improving patients 'physical and emotional health require further research since this study is not powered to compare the effectiveness of different com- binations to each other. In addition, a comparison ofintegrative medicine to usual care would help define the effectiveness of different treatment approaches to chronic pain. Investigating the therapeutic impact of a \"whole systems \" approach such as our integrative intervention is a daunting challenge, as funding agencies are accustomed to a morereductionist approach to assessing which individual com- ponent of a multimodality inte rvention is the active one. In addition, the conventional approach would be to deliver astandardized intervention to all study participants. These conventions run counter to the philosophy of integrative medicine, which places the needs of the unique personseeking care first and designs an appropriate personal- ized intervention based on the individual 's assessment, much akin to practitioners of traditional Eastern medicine.New initiatives, such as the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, will hopefully have animpact in advancing research of integrative medicine interventions [25-28]. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act required the Department of Health and Human Services to enlist the Institute of Medicine in examining pain as a public health problem. The recommendations from theinstitute suggest that among the \"steps to improving care, healthcare providers should in creasingly aim at tailoring pain care to each person 's experience, and self-management of pain should be promoted \"[1]. Although it is often easier and faster to respond to the pat ient presenting with chronic pain by writing a prescription , increasingly for a substance with addictive potential, an i ntegrative medicine approach may more closely approximate the Institute of Medicine 's blueprint for transforming health care.
