As we enter the next phase of the pandemic response, the University will continue to follow the lead of public health officials and make decisions based on science. COVID-19 testing will no longer be required at MCPHS. We want to thank you for all your efforts in keeping MCPHS a safe Community throughout the pandemic by following health and safety protocols including frequent COVID-19 testing. Students All students are required to be immunized for COVID-19 or have an approved exemption. If a student is unable to obtain one or more immunizations due to medical or religious reasons, they may upload the [Vaccine Exemption Form](/-/media/files/docs/studentlife/immunization-office/mcphs-student-vaccine-exemption-form-2023-2024.pdf) to CastleBranch. Medical and religious exemptions must be renewed annually at the start of each school year. Students who test positive for COVID-19 should follow the [student-documented absence policy](https://www.mcphs.edu/departments/student-affairs/documented-absence). Faculty and Staff The University will no longer require COVID-19 vaccinations for employees but strongly recommend following [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/index.html) for these vaccinations. As studies continue to show, COVID-19 vaccinations have a proven track record of preventing serious illness. Mask Requirements Beginning May 2023, masks are no longer required at MCPHS clinics and treatment centers beyond the standard protocols that were in place before the pandemic.
