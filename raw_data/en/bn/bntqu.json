These may include certain nutritional supplements. After all, healing occurs from the inside out and the body must have the right building blocks for healing. It has become increasingly difficult for people to get the necessary nutrients from foods alone due to depleted soil and processed foods. In the past, I have given recommendations for specific types of supplements but did not provide resources for patients to obtain supplements through our office. In recent years, there have been increasing issues regarding supplement manufacturers sourcing ingredients from foreign and cheap suppliers. This has led to a decline in the quality of supplements purchased through many retail and online sources. Another common issue is that many supplements are privately labeled which means the supplement is branded by one entity but manufactured by an entirely different company. As a NeuroStructural Chiropractor, I have recommended supplements to patients for support of their NeuroStructural Correction for over 20 years. We have been personally using supplements from the company that makes PROTOCOL FOR LIFE BALANCE for this entire time. They have been manufacturing food supplements for over 50 years. In November 2018, Michelle and I had the opportunity to tour the manufacturing plant for PROTOCOL FOR LIFE BALANCE. This amazing tour gave us a better understanding of the development, manufacturing, and distribution process. We witnessed many of the steps used to create their supplements from the storage of raw materials to the finished product. They are a GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) 'A'-rated manufacturer by the Natural Products Association (NPA) which fully complies with federal cGMP regulations. In addition, they manufacture most of their products in house and have state of the art in-house laboratory equipment with advanced analytical instrumentation to extensively test every raw material for identity, potency and purity. Their parent company is one of the first companies to be certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) for their dietary supplement manufacturing process. During the tour by the Nutrition Education Manager, Neil Levin, I was struck when he made a statement about their microscales for weighing very small quantities of ingredients. These scales were inside of a small glass housing that sat upon a marble table, approximately a foot thick, located in a sealed room. Mr. Levin stressed the importance of being able to weigh out very small quantities of certain ingredients very accurately. He used the example of Vitamin D which is measured in IU (International Units). A typical dose of Vitamin D in a supplement may be somewhere between 1,000-4,000 IU. There are 40 million IU of Vitamin D in 1 gram which weighs about as much as a small paperclip. One of the reasons that his statements struck me was because I remembered articles about an alternative medicine advocate, Gary Null, whose supplement was mislabeled. Mr. Null overdosed on Vitamin D from taking his own (private labeled) product for a month which contained 1,000 times the amount on the label. The reason that I highly recommend PROTOCOL FOR LIFE BALANCE is because I have seen their manufacturing process and met multiple employees of their company. Ultimately, it is a question of trust. This trust has been built through touring their manufacturing plant, seeing their quality control and understanding their extensive industry certifications.
