While we enjoy working with patients with various health-related goals, we often treat people with complex chronic conditions. Many patients who come to see us have been to many doctors without finding the relief they are looking for. With Naturopathic and Functional Medicine, we take a unique approach that honors who you are and allows you to find optimal health that may have once felt impossible. Naturopathic Medicine is a comprehensive medical system that approaches each individual from the perspective of their personalized needs. Our clinicians can help you uncover the root cause of your health concerns and work with you to create a comprehensive care plan that honors your body's unique capacity to heal. Our Naturopathic Doctor, Dr. Robert Kachko, is a licensed Naturopathic Physician in Stamford, Connecticut, and offers naturopathic consultations in Manhattan, New York. Your first visit with the doctor is 90 minutes long, and during this time, you'll review your previous health history and come up with a comprehensive plan to help you get well and stay well. A Note from Dr. Kachko I'm Dr. Robert Kachko, and I'd like to help you re-discover how to feel like yourself again. Vibrant health is possible. Despite what you may have been told, there IS a reason you are feeling the way you have been. Your brain and body are not broken, and the symptoms you're feeling don't have to be with you forever. If you've been struggling with your physical or mental health, it's essential to understand that only one approach will work long-term. This approach honors you and your experience as more than something that requires a 15-minute doctor's visit or a quick fix. Your body tells you a story, and I'd like to help you learn to listen to it. The symptoms you are experiencing are signs of a body and brain out of balance. Through a holistic, integrative medicine approach, we'll discover the root cause of your struggles and create a plan for sustainable recovery. Together, we will consider all the factors that have led to your symptoms through comprehensive assessment and lab testing. With this knowledge, we'll put together a treatment plan that will help you feel better now and for many years into the future. As a Naturopathic Physician and Licensed Acupuncturist, I combine cutting-edge advances from modern medicine with time-tested traditional approaches to healing. In addition, I've received training and certification in multiple mind-body medicine approaches, including Somatic Experiencing, Clinical Hypnotherapy, Biofeedback, Functional Neurology, and Biopsychosocial Pain Management. I look forward to working with you!
