They would eat large quantities of cabbage at night before drinking, as this would allow them to drink more alcoholic beverages without feeling the side effects.

Cabbage juice taken with tomato juice works wonders as it reduces the craving for alcohol and also helps in metabolism,\" suggests Dr. Mani. Do's and Don'ts of Drinking Make sure you never take alcohol on an empty stomach. Always eat something before or while you are enjoying your drinks as this will not only slow down the rate at which alcohol enters your blood, but will also reduce the after-effects. Try to alternate between an alcoholic drink and a non-alcoholic beverage. This will lead to an overall reduction in the quantity of alcohol you consume. Prefer clear alcohol, such as white wine, vodka, gin etc. It is believed that the darker the alcoholic drink, the more likely it is to cause hangovers, thanks to the presence of more congeners (a substance in alcohol that is supposed to cause headaches). Avoid sweet and sugary foods after or while you drink. Sweet taste makes it tough for the drinker to judge how much alcohol he/she is actually consuming. It also believed that sugar makes the drink hit you harder. Try not to have a carbonated drink with alcohol as carbonation speeds up the alcohol absorption. Drinking water is the best [cure](https://www.speakingtree.in/topics/health/cure) for a hangover. So try to drink as much water as you can while you are drinking. Food is probably the last thing you want to look at while recovering, but your body needs energy. Energise your body with clear liquids tilll you can tolerate solid food. Start eating slowly with easy-to-digest foods such as plain toast, rice or clear soup. The morning after the alcoholic binge, have omelette with bread. Eggs provide energy to the body, build up the protein content and remove the accumulated toxins in the body. Juice, especially freshly squeezed orange juice, helps raising your blood sugar levels together with easing some of the hangover symptoms. However, if your stomach is upset, skip acidic juices such as orange juice and stick to apple juice instead. Pepto-Bismol or an antacid is taken to relieve queasiness and settle your stomach. You can even take a mult-ivitamin or vitamin B capsules that help restoring the energy lost during your night "}
