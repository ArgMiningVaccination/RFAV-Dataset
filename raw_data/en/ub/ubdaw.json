For me, withdrawing into hibernation is a special time of introspection and self-realization. We all need it, as givers in the world: time for self love, to recharge, so that we may continue to do what we do best. So that we may continue to fully give, and fully receive, by keeping in harmony the dance between the two. Bear Medicine by Krista Katrovas I go deep into my cave, recharge my soul, so that I may continue to give. I am a giver, love to share energy, to serve the under-served, but there comes a time when I must retreat, before I run on empty. When I find that my breath has landed around my chest, near my ears, rather than in my belly like a relaxed baby asleep in a crib, this is when I crawl deeply within, inside my cave. I don't change out of my pajamas. I read inspirational books, passages that inspire, poems, and I create poems, too, since creativity is the presence of the spiritual guiding my path. I meditate, snuggle with the dog, with the cats nearby on the other side of the bed. I light a candle, stare at the flame, watch its selfless dance. I soak in a long hot bath where I wash away all that does not serve my highest self. When I resurface from my den, from my private, \"Red Tent,\" I begin singing again, giving again, serving again, loving every aspect of my being in the world, for myself, for others, for such giving is not easy without my Bear Medicine. |Artwork by Jackie Morris| Krista Katrovas (E-RYT) has dedicated herself to the practice, study and teaching of yoga since discovering it in 1999 after dancing rigorously as a dance major in college.
