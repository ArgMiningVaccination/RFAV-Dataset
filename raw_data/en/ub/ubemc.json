The Australian Geospatial Health Lab (AGeoH-L) is a unique disease prevention infrastructure being developed through a partnership between the University of Canberra and GIS industry world leader Esri. AGeoH-L innovates the integration of advanced tools for managing, transforming, analysing and visualising spatially-referenced data. Spatial epidemiological analysis then identifies built, social and physical environmental factors that shape risk, disease and outcomes (complications, hospitalisations, death). Geospatial modelling and inferential, multi-level analyses further assess environmental features and risk factors against diseases and outcomes that vary over time and respond (or not) to policy and public health and practice-based intervention. This capability can identify high-priority environmental and population targets and support decision-making for policy and practice-based interventions to efficiently prevent and reduce population disease risks and treatment costs. Professor Mark Daniel Mark Daniel is Professor of Epidemiology in the Health Research Institute, University of Canberra where he leads the Spatial Epidemiology Group. He is also Professorial Fellow in the Department of Medicine, St. Vincent's Hospital, The University of Melbourne, and Senior Principal Research Fellow, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute.

Professor Matthew Cook Director of Immunology ACT Health Directorate, Professor of Medicine, ANU Medical School, and Director of the Centre for Personalised Immunology, The John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University Our Health in Our Hands: future personalised medical technologies for a sustainable and effective healthcare The unprecedented technological and medical achievements of the 20th century have significantly contributed to improve our quality of life. Yet, the rapid rise of healthcare expenditure is challenging the sustainability of existing health systems. Healthcare costs account for ~18% of the gross domestic product in the USA and 10% in Australia. Explanations for this unsustainable rise in healthcare cost include the burden of chronic disease for which treatment is often targeted at symptoms and complications, rather than underlying causes, and related problems such as toxicity and off-target effects of conventional treatments, poor compliance to treatments, failure to prevent and diagnose disease in its early stages, and failure to stratify patients with similar disease but different risks of disease progression and severity. Furthermore despite growing expenditure, significant health inequities exist with inferior access to healthcare and diagnostic services affecting remote and/or vulnerable populations including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. The considerable expense of new and effective therapies also creates a risk of inequity, and this cost is multiplied when the expensive treatments are administered without sufficient knowledge of which patients and populations will benefit from them. The inaugural Australian National University Grand Challenge \"Our Health in Our Hands\" aims to personalise medicine, in the broadest sense, which means devising strategies for diagnosing, treating and monitoring the risk of illness, tailored to individual need irrespective of geographical location or social circumstances, to ensure that healthcare can be provided equally and effectively to a rapidly growing world population. In this presentation, we will introduce the key motivation and aims of our research programs, reviewing short- and long-term goals, as well as innovative medical technologies that may play a role in triggering the future digitalization and further personalisation of health care. Professor Matthew Cook Matthew Cook is Professor of Medicine at the Australian National University (ANU), Director of Immunology at Canberra Hospital and Director of the Centre for Personalised Immunology, an NHMRC Centre of Research Excellence. He is also founder Canberra Clinical Genomics, a joint venture between ACT Health Directorate and ANU. He is a clinician-scientist with more than 20 years' experience investigating the pathogenesis of human immunological disease, and more recently, has investigated genome variation as a discovery platform for understanding human immune disease. Associate Professor Bruce Shadbolt Executive Branch Manager, Centre for Health and Medical Research, ACT Health Directorate; Associate Professor, The Australian National University Medical School and Biologic Data Science Institute HARC - the Health Analytics Research Collaboration HARC is a collaboration between ACT Health Directorate and Services and academic partners focused on health data science, research methods and analytics in both qualitative and quantitative areas. It aims to: - Drive high quality and efficient research and innovation - Strengthen strategic partnerships - Accelerate translation of knowledge to practice and policy The HARC Management Committee reflects this broad collaboration and supports initiatives such as the HealthANSWERS Partnership and the system-wide research data framework being developed. A major step in the early phase of HARC's stewardship is establishment of the HARC network and novel AI flagship projects that translate knowledge from research into practice and policy. Details on HARC will be further explained, including the draft Research Data Governance Framework and the proposed statistical learning model to operationalise the use of research and data in quality improvement. Associate Professor Shadbolt Associate Professor Shadbolt has combined a career in healthcare services with research to lead the epidemiological and data science directions of ACT Health Directorate in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). With university qualifications in science, psychology, mathematics and epidemiology, Associate Professor Shadbolt has a broad understanding of research and its role in healthcare delivery. His PhD in women's health and social roles using a life course design paved the way for the Australian Women's Longitudinal Study and changes to family and work legislation to support better family-work balance. His research with the Australian National University and ACT Health Directorate has primarily focused on using evaluation, research and data science skills to improve clinical practice. As part of this, evidence-based medicine and translating new evidence into clinical care have been paramount to Associate Professor Shadbolt's endeavours. Professor Penelope Schofield Professor of Health Psychology, School of Health Sciences, Swinburne University of Technology; Program Lead: Personalized Health Care Innovation, Iverson Health Innovation Research Institute, Swinburne University of Technology; Head of Behavioural Research, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Developing effective, clinically feasible and sustainable models for people receiving palliative care and their families. People with advanced cancer nearing the end of life have an array of physical, psychological, practical and spiritual needs. A recent systematic review identified the most commonly reported needs were: emotional support; fatigue; and information about the benefits and side-effects of treatment. However, there is a paucity of robust evidence-based, psycho-educational interventions to address these needs in the palliative care domain. Interventions which are designed to cater for individuals' unique needs while placing minimal demands on the acute health care setting are urgently required. As a result of extensive intervention development and testing, I have conceptualised a comprehensive framework for the development and delivery of supportive cancer care interventions to ensure that they are effective, clinically feasible and sustainable in this climate of economic constraint. Seven key features required in the development of an intervention in order to achieve effective and easy translation into usual care consist of 1) targeting a cancer type and stage, 2) tailoring to individuals unique needs, 3) promoting self-management, 4) efficient intervention delivery, 5) ensuring evidence-based and theoretical grounding, 6) specifying protocol training and adherence, and 7) confirming stakeholder acceptability. How this model can be applied to the palliative care field will be considered. Professor Schofield A behavioural scientist by training, Penny Schofield was the Director and Scientific Director, Department of Cancer Experiences Research, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia for 15 years before her appointment as Professor of Health Psychology at Swinburne University in March 2015. She still maintains her research team at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, as Head of Behavioural Science. She has nearly 30 years' experience in behavioural, psycho-social, quality of life and supportive care research in cancer, particularly randomised controlled trials. Her research program adopts a comprehensive approach to develop and deliver effective and sustainable interventions that promote self-care, improve emotional and physical outcomes and end of life care for patients with cancer and other chronic illnesses, and alleviate burden on the health system. Professor Kathy Eagar Professor of Health Services Research and Director, Australian Health Services Research Institute (AHSRI), University of Wollongong Choices at end of life This paper will give an overview of death and dying in Australia and will canvass end of life choices. This will include prevention, acute care, advanced care planning, palliative care and voluntary assisted dying. Along the way, it will canvas critical research questions and challenges about end of life care.

She has authored over 450 papers on management, quality, outcomes, information systems and funding of the Australia and New Zealand health and community care systems. Dr Kerrie Noonan Co-founder of the GroundSwell Project Creating Compassionate Communities and developing community capacity around palliative care and grief. As the need for excellent palliative and end of life care grows in Australia, as does the need for healthcare providers and services to keep engaging with community members. Likewise community members do have know-how about some aspects of end of life and this is under-recognised in our medicalised system. This presentation will discuss the public health approach to palliative care, providing an overview of recent research examining death literacy, and this practical know-how about death and loss in Australia and some of the creative community initiatives that are developing to address it. Dr Kerrie Noonan Dr Kerrie Noonan is a clinical psychologist in palliative care. She is a social researcher with the Caring at End of Life Research Group at Western Sydney University, and is an Investigator on the Death Literacy Index project. This pioneering research has investigated the role of family, friends and neighbours play when someone is dying at home and coined the term 'death literacy' and the now development of the Death Literacy Index. Over the past 25 years Kerrie has been working to create a more death literate society, one where people and communities have the practical know-how needed to plan well and respond to dying death and grief. Kerrie has a long-standing interest in community capacity building approaches to death, dying and bereavement, palliative care and how people can build their death literacy. She is the founding executive director of The GroundSwell Project and national initiatives Dying to Know Day, FilmLife Project and ComComHub. She is active in the Compassionate Communities movement internationally. Kerrie was awarded her PhD in 2018 by Western Sydney University for her study titled Renegade Stories: A study of deathworkers using social approaches to dying, death and loss in Australia. Kerrie has a Master's degree in Clinical Psychology, a BA (Psychology), and a Grad. Dip. in Systemic Therapy (Family Therapy) and a fellow of the Sydney School for Social Entrepreneurs. My clinical experience involves palliative care, health psychology, loss and grief, pain management, program development and evaluation research. She sits on the council of Public Health Palliative Care International and is the co-Chair of the Organising Committee for the 6th PHPCI Conference in 2019.

Professor Imogen Mitchell Director - ANU Medical School, Senior Medical Advisor at the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care and Senior Intensive Care Specialist at the Canberra Hospital Dying surrounded by equipment and machines The number of Australians dying each year is just over 160 000 with nearly 40 000 occurring in an intensive care unit. It is likely over half will have received invasive ventilation and vasopressor support and many up to the time of or near their death. Only a handful of these patients will have seen a specialist palliative care team. The challenge we face as a community is appreciating that most deaths are expected and yet we fail to discuss what will be important to us at the time of death and whether intensive care is part of the picture. Professor Mitchell Professor Mitchell is an intensive care specialist and is a recognised clinical and health systems researcher, specifically in the development of sustainable processes for managing patient deterioration and end of life care. Professor Mitchell was awarded a Harkness Fellowship in 2013-2014 at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health studying health systems and health policy and currently provides advice to the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. Professor Michael Woods Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation, University of Technology Sydney Improving the availability of palliative care - identifying unmet need at the local level Professor Woods will report on the development of a Palliative Care Performance Framework which could underpin the long-term assessment of the availability and performance of Australia's palliative care services. The value of the Framework lies in its ability to identify unmet need at the local level, assess changes in availability and service performance in each region over time and assess and compare service provision in different regions. The framework has been trialled in two Primary Health Networks; Sydney North and Murray (northern Victoria). Professor Michael Woods Michael Woods is a Professor of Health Economics at the Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation (CHERE) at the University of Technology Sydney and Visiting Scholar at the Australian National University. He is on the Board of the Australian Digital Health Agency and a member of the Aged Care Financing Authority. Professor Woods' research focus is on aged care reform, the delivery of palliative care and end of life care, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the health workforce and the economics and financing of health systems. In 2016 Mike was the Independent Reviewer for COAG Health Council Review of the Workforce Education Accreditation System under NRAS. Professor Woods was previously Deputy Chairman of the Productivity Commission and Presiding Commissioner on over 20 national Inquiries, including Caring for Older Australians, Science and Innovation and Australia's Health Workforce. Since 2001 Mike has held senior research and policy advisory roles in East and South East Asia, including with the World Bank, the OECD and the former AusAID. Previously he was the Under Treasurer for the Australian Capital Territory. Nikki Johnston Nurse Practitioner Clare Holland House, ACT Winner of the inaugural Health Ministers award for Nursing Trailblazing 2019 Better lives and better deaths in aged care through specialist palliative care needs rounds: results from a stepped wedge randomised control trial Specialist palliative care provision for aged care residents is often woefully inadequate, and residents experience high levels of unnecessary hospitalisation. This points to an urgent clinical priority to manage residents' complex needs in the aged care setting. We developed and tested a new approach to provide specialist palliative care in aged care, called Needs Rounds. Nikki Johnston Nikki became a registered nurse in 1989 and a Nurse Practitioner in 2008. She was recognised in the 2019 Australia Day Honors as a recipient of a Medal of the Order of Australia for her contribution to nursing and the winner of the inaugural Health Ministers award for Nursing Trailblazing 2019. Finalist in the team of the year Hesta Awards 2019. Currently working for Calvary Public Hospital Bruce , Clare Holland House, Nikki believes all Australia's deserve access to quality care in their last months of life regardless of their age, diagnosis or where they live. Currently end of life care experiences differ broadly for those living in residential aged care and access to specialist palliative care isn't usual practice. Nikki has initiated research through the INSPIRED trial which integrates specialist palliative care into residential aged care through the use of Palliative Care Needs Rounds. The trial found that regular rounds identified residents most at risk of dying without an adequate plan in place. Nikki's approach improves RACF staff confidence in discussing death and dying with families and planning for symptoms and goals of care at end of life. It supports palliative care in RACF and normalizes death and dying, while providing essential anticipatory prescribing and better decision-making leading to planned care for residents. Dr Brett Scholz Research Fellow in the Medical School, ANU College of Health and Medicine, Board Member for the ACT Mental Health Consumer Network Consumer leadership in palliative care: redressing power imbalances against experiential expertise Contemporary health policies require meaningful consumer involvement in all stages of service planning, implementation, delivery, and evaluation. A recent systematic review found that the extent to which consumer engagement taking place in palliative care services and systems is not meeting policy requirements. Further, the palliative care sector is not benefiting from the value that brought by more meaningfully partnering with consumers in decision-making processes. One problematic rhetoric relates to the assumption often made that consumers lack capacity to make decisions for services and systems. I will discuss the implications of the current lack of consumer leadership in palliative care and challenge us all to explore ways in which we can work to meaningfully partner with consumers across the sector. Dr Brett Scholz Brett Scholz is a critical health psychologist and research fellow in the ANU Medical School whose work focuses on critical approaches to health organisations and systems. Specifically, his research has three interrelated foci: 1. challenging barriers to consumer leadership of health organisations and systems through reducing discrimination and tokenism, 2. improving uptake of consumer leadership in health organisations and systems (including services, research, teaching, and policy) by demonstrating the value brought to the sector by consumers in decision-making roles, and 3. Exploring the role of allies (non-consumer stakeholders) in supporting, advocating for, and facilitating consumer leadership in health organisations and systems. Geraldine Doogue Presenter ABC Radio National Saturday Extra Good living and safe dying - ABC Radio National Broadcast panel discussion chaired by Geraldine Doogue Panel members: Dr Kerri Noonan, Professor Imogen Mitchell, Nikki Johnson, Suzanne Rainsford Most Australians will at some point in their lives need support to live well with a life-limiting illness. All Australians should be able to experience dying with safety and comfort. Achieving this for all Australians will require considerable planning, engagement and resources. Australia has a strong international reputation in palliative care provision for those who receive it, this is in part due to recognition that good living and safe dying means different things to different people. Living well with a life limiting illness knowing that there will be a safe and comfortable death requires us to enhance our community's influence on and involvement in the end of life care they receive in addition to improving the quality and availability of palliative and end-of-life care healthcare services.
