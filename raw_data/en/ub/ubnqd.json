For a lot of people, that first step is to stop putting bad things into the body and clearing it out so your digestive organs, liver, gallbladder and rest of the system can detox and repair. What Are the Benefits of a Full Body Detox? During a full body cleanse, your body rids itself of all the toxins that have built up inside it. This process refreshes the body by first removing everything unhealthy, like unnatural chemicals and preservatives before beginning to replenish the system with whole, healthy foods. A full body cleanse creates a foundation for a healthy lifestyle. It's a fresh start for you and your body that will allow you to build your system back up with healthy foods and take the first steps toward achieving your physical goals. Our Body Cleanse Program When you want to begin the journey to living a healthy life, we may recommend that you participate in our 21-day full body cleanse. This one-of-a-kind, 21-day transformation is designed to help you make healthy lifestyle changes that will give you energy \u2014 and as a bonus, you'll shed at least a few pounds in the process. At Westerville Chiropractic and Nutrition, we'll provide you with all the guidance and resources needed to successfully complete a 21-day full body cleanse. Phase One: Detoxification The first phase of our cleanse program is a detox period where your body will shed harmful toxins that are contributing to weight gain, sleeping issues, fatigue and energy loss, high cholesterol, and a host of other issues. In the modern world, toxins are everywhere, and we don't realize the negative impacts they can have on our bodies \u2014 weight gain, problems with the digestive tract, depression, and sallow or acne-prone skin. Once these chemicals are removed from your body, you'll start to feel more in control of your lifestyle and your cravings for unhealthy food. Phase Two: Cleanse After eliminating as many toxins as possible from your system, we'll help you replenish with a whole-food and supplement-based program designed to rebuild and repair the internal and external systems of the body. This phase uses REAL food \u2014 never processed, prepackaged, foods packed with chemicals and harmful preservatives. We'll teach you how to incorporate healthy foods into your daily diet sustainably for a complete transformation of your body and your lifestyle. The Results of a Body Detox During your cleanse, you can expect to lose a few pounds as well as learn how to continue making healthy choices in the future, but the benefits to a full-body cleanse go way beyond weight loss. Our 21-day Westerville detox program is designed to detoxify the liver, the kidney, and the gut. Your cleanse will help revitalize and clean out these systems by removing harmful toxins so that they can function optimally. At Westerville Chiropractic and Nutrition, we've found that our cleanses have helped reduce weight, reduce the negative side effects of a fatty liver, balance hormones directly related to the liver, and promote huge drops in LDL cholesterol \u2014 the \"bad\" kind. After our 21-Day cleanse, you'll have a clean start \u2014 a blank slate on which to grow. Whether you want to build flexibility, release tension, relieve chronic pain, or just continue living a healthier lifestyle, we can help you in the whatever direction you'd like to go.
