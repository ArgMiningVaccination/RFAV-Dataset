Winter can be a time when we accumulate more toxins due to being less active and sweating less. A comprehensive detoxification plan includes [diet](https://drlaurell.com/2014/01/04/detoxification-support-part-1-dietary-guide-to-aid-detox/), [exercise](https://drlaurell.com/2014/01/11/detoxification-support-part-2-sweating/), [herbs, and dietary supplements](https://drlaurell.com/2014/01/26/detoxification-support-part-4-love-your-liver/). Now, we also understand how homeopathic remedies can enhance this detoxification plan. Homeopathy is the use of a highly diluted version of a substance that in its undiluted form causes symptoms similar to what the individual is experiencing. A classic example is the use of homeopathic dilutions of onion to help eye irritation and tearing during allergy season. We also sometimes use the homeopathic dilution of the exact substance that is causing the problem. These homeopathic remedies are so dilute that they don't pose any harm to the body but are enough to help stimulate its defenses. Currently, I am concerned about the toxin arsenic. The most common sources of arsenic exposure are things we consume regularly: water, rice, and chicken. This low level chronic exposure may be contributing to health issues such as fatigue, headaches, anxiety, neurological issues, and increased risk of diabetes and cancer. While this is not the only toxic metal in our environment and food supply that concerns me, arsenic has some interesting research that might help us understand how to use homeopathic remedies in our detox plans. In a study where E. coli bacteria were exposed to a form of arsenic, clear toxic effects were noticed, such as DNA changes and disrupted growth. When identical E. coli exposed to arsenic were also given homeopathic arsenic (Arsenicum album 30C), these negative effects were reduced. The new theory on homeopathy is that these highly dilute substances are stimulating cellular defense mechanisms, such as increasing the production of enzymes used during detoxification, without causing any harm from the remedy itself. After reviewing studies such as this one, I have begun including homeopathic preparations in the detox protocols for people that I suspect have heavy metal exposure. I don't rely on the homeopathic remedies alone. I include healthy diet changes, exercise, herbs, and other nutrients, such as [N-Acetyl Cysteine](https://drlaurell.com/2011/10/20/support-for-liver-detoxification/), that the enzymes involved in detoxification use. It was always thought that homeopathy stimulates the body's natural healing processes, and now with this better idea of how, we can further harness the potential of this unique form of medicine to help unburden our bodies from toxins. This is the same philosophy that inspired the creation of [Liddell's line of homeopathic products to support detoxification.](https://www.liddell.net/product-category/detox/) [Metals Detox](https://www.liddell.net/product/metals-detox/) has 30C dilutions of arsenic, mercury, lead, and other heavy metals that may help temporarily relieve symptoms like headache, fatigue, poor concentration, and restless sleep that can be associated with these metals. If you are interested in detoxifying yourself of harmful metals but don't have access to a naturopathic doctor or other natural healthcare provider, it's nice to know that Liddell\u00ae makes getting into homeopathy simple. All the guesswork is taken out. Dr. Laurell Matthews has a bachelor's degree in biochemistry and received her doctorate in naturopathic medicine from Bastyr University. "}
