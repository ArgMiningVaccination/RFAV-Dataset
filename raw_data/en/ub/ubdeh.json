Howev er this frame work does not provide for innovation that meets health needs and adde d therapeutic value for use in countries where profitable markets do not exist.7 Furthermore, patents (and other forms of intellectual property) for medicines delay compet ition by prohibiting lowcost copies (generic medicines). This results in higher prices for medicines that neither developing country governments nor poor people can pay without sacrificing other basic necessities, and has disastrous consequences for millions of poor people.8 Deve loping countries have addressed some of the challenges created by the extension of the patent system under TRIPS. The Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health was agreed in November 2001 by all World Trade Organi sation (WTO) mem bers. It provided assuran ce that intellectual rty (IP) rules should not prevent gove rnmen ts from taking meas ures to protect public health, while also offering least develope d countries (LDCs) a transition period to 2016 to implement TRIPS.9 At the same time, the Worl d Health Organization (WHO) has secured a mandate, based on the politic al will of government s and existing evidence, to examine and promote models of innovation that lie outside the patent system and that have the potenti al to gener ate health prod ucts appr opriate for developin g countries.10 These welcome shifts have occurred in spite of fierce resistance by the multinationa l pharma ceutical industry. European Union (EU) Memb er States and the Euro pean Com mission (EC) have taken some steps to improve access to health services, 2 including access to health techn ologies in developin g countries. Within the EU, many EU Mem ber States have policies in place to reduce medicines prices for their citizens,11 while the EC has launched an inquiry into the perverse incentives and abuse of the IP system by mult inational pharmaceutical companies and the costs of these abuses for health systems and patients.12 The EC is also committing nearly one billion euro on behalf of Europeans to new resea rch and development (R&D ) aimed at generating new therapies .13 Yet the EU is guilty of double standards, with the EU's trade agenda acting directly against these same objectives in developin g countries. The EU is pushing a range of IP measures that would support the comm ercial interests of the pharmaceutical industry, while damaging the opportunities for innovation and access to medicin es in developin g countries. These meas ures include: 1. Introducing TRIPSplus rules (IP rules that exceed obligat ions unde r WTO rules) through agreements, especially free trade agreem ents (FTAs ) with developing countries. 2. Exerting bilateral pressure upon developin g countries to prevent the use of TRIPS public health safegua rds to reduce medicine prices. 3. Leadin g on a new global fram ework to enforce IP rules, within which elements of European legislation are resulting in the seizure of generic medicines in transi t, inten ded for developing countries. EU demand s excee d those pursued by the previous United States government, whose IP policies were criticized for their negative effects on health in developing countries for many years by developing country trade negotiators and Ministers of Health,14 civil society groups,15 and intergovernmental organizations.16 Strict levels of IP prote ction imposed through EU trade policies will result in a vast increase of expenditure for medicines purchased by donors, developin g countries, and households. India, which exports twothirds of the affordable medicines its generi c compani es prod uce to developin g countries, includin g over 80 percent of the world's gene ric anti retroviral medicines, could face severe restrictions that would deny affordable medicines to millions of peopl e in India and jeopa rdize exports of its gene ric medicin es to the world's poorest countries.17 European donors and the European Comm ission have taken some initiatives to promo te innovat ion in developing countries. For example, the Com mission has initiated a model progr amme to improve clinical trial capacity in developing countries, and it has introduced new regulations to ensure that studies are carried out in order to assure the safety of new paed iatric medicines for children in all age bands. Yet overall, not enough has been done and the Commi ssion has not contributed its fair share to stimulate innovation to address diseases that disproportionately affect developin g countries. Its overall spending on R&D for innovation for developing countries is growin g, but rema ins insufficient. 3 The EU has obstructed progress on measures at the WHO that would explore new models of R&D to address essentia l public health needs in developing countries.18 Without innovation to addr ess these needs, many millions of men, women, and children will continue to wait for solutions that fail to materia lise. The incoming European Comm ission provides an oppo rtunity to bring much needed coherence to EU policies - a chan ce to ensure that it no longer takes with one hand what it gives with the other. At present, EU policies on innovation and intellectual property diminish other investments that the EU and Member States are making to impr ove health care in developin g countries. This makes a mockery of the Com mission's own drive to demonst rate policy coherence across its own institutions, and ignores the political will of many stakeholders, including some Member States of the EU. While the EC has led in the impleme ntation of these policies , Mem ber States, with few exceptions, have stood by silently as the EC has implem ented its damag ing IP agen da internationally. In order to improv e innovation and access to medicin es for developing countries, Oxfam International and Heal th Action Internat ional recommend the following: 1. The European Comm ission and EU Mem ber States should honour comm itments under the MDGs, the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, and relevant World Heal th Assem bly (WHA ) resolutions on innovation and access to medicines, includin g full implem entat ion of the WHO 'Global Strategy and Plan of Action'. 2. The EU should ensure its trade policy is in line with its development objectives, including specifically enhancin g access to health care and access to medicin es. This includes ensur ing that trade rules, whether multilateral, regiona l, or bilater al, exclude essential public services such as educa tion, health, and wate r and sanitation from liberalization commitments.19 EU Member States must act to hold the EC accountable when the EC fails to uphold these principles. 3. With respec t to IP: The EU and Mem ber States should not misuse FTAs to introduce TRIPSplus IP rules in developin g countries to extend monopoly prote ction and introduce new enforcement meas ures, which limit access to medicin es. The European Comm ission should stop exerting press ure on government s that attem pt to introduce safeguards and flexibilities to prote ct and promot e public health. The European Comm ission should amend its counterf eiting regulation to ensure it does not have a detrime ntal impa ct on developing countries, by excluding border meas ures for violations of pharma ceutical patent s, especially for medicines in trans it. 4 The EU should ensure that the AntiCounterfeit ing Trade Agreeme nt (ACTA) does not set a new globa l standard for intellectual property rules (IPR) that impedes access to medicin es in developin g countries. Therefore, the EU should ensure that patents are exclu ded from any agreed framewo rk. The European Comm ission and Member States should ident ify and support other meas ures to improve access to generic medicines in developing countries, including the UNITA ID patent pool for HIV and AIDS medicines. 4. With respec t to R&D: European donors, including the Commission, should scale up financia l contributions to R&D to address diseases that disprop ortionately affect people living in developin g countries, especially through alternative funding mechanisms that promot e therapeutic innovation. The EU should also support Product Development Partnerships (PDPs) that are designed to deliver afforda ble and effect ive new produc ts, and it should continu e building R&D capacity in developing countri es. The EU should support the implementat ion of the World Health Orga nization 's Global Strategy and Plan of Action (GSPA) on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property, and support the Expert Working Group in its efforts to explore new models of innovation that increase both innovation and access. The European Comm ission should take appropriate measures to ensur e that specific initiatives such as the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) meet real health needs, and that both the IMI and the EUs regulation on children's medicin es can also be to the benefit of developin g countries.

The cost of medicin es represents the greates t share of health care expenditures for people in poor countries. Expend itures on pharmaceuticals range from 10 to 20 percent of expendit ures on health in the richest countries and 20 to 60 percent in poorer countries.22 Unlike many rich countries, most developin g countries lack universal health insurance. Across Asia, medicin es comprise between 20 and 80 percent of outofpocket health care costs .23 In Peru, where 70 percent of expenditures on medicines are paid for outofpocket, only 52 percent of the population has health insuranc e, and coverage mostly exclu des those below the poverty line.24 Additionally, innova tion is inade quate for medicines needed to address diseases disproportionatel y affecting people in developin g countries, leaving many people without effect ive treatment. In recent years, prog ress has been made to improve innovation and access to medicin es. In 2001, all World Trade Organization (WTO) Mem ber States signed the Doha Declaration on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and Public Health, recognising concerns about the effects of intellectual property (IP) rules on gene ric competition, a proven mechanism to reduce medicin e prices. The Declara tion affirms that IP rules should not prevent countries from taking meas ures to protect public health.25 Lowe r prices for medicin es, achieved through gene ric competition, have enabled 4 million people to start treatment for HIV and AIDS.26 Moreover, developin g countries, such as Thailand, have used WTO rules to reduc e medicine prices and provide free, publicsector treatmen ts for HIV and AIDS, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.27 Efforts to encourage R&D into diseases that disproportionate ly affect developing countries are encoura ging. Some prod uct development partn erships (PDPs) sugg est a pipeline of promising medicin es and vaccines that could deliver new treatments for neglected diseases, while innovative financin g mechanisms have introduced incentives to encourage private sector R&D for the same purpose.28 In addition, new models of innovat ion and access such as patent pools and prize funds have been tabled. These could generate techn ologies that meet the health needs of develo ping countri es.29 6 The European Union, under the present Treaty and under Lisbon, comm it to the principle of 'Health in all Policies',30 which guarantees that a 'high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definit ion and implement ation of all Union policies and activities.'31 The Treaty also stipulates that all the European Union's external policies should be coherent with the EU's development objectives. Yet the European Union, led by the European Comm ission, particularly the Directorate Genera l (DG) Trade, is acting in ways that will reverse prog ress made by many towa rds achieving bette r access to medical prod ucts in developing countries. Instead of implement ing coherent polices to improve public health, the EU has introduced polic ies and practices that undermine access to afforda ble medicines by strengthenin g IP protection in developin g countries to advan ce the interests of mult inational pharmaceutical compa nies. EU trade policies therefore unde rmine the obligations that EU Mem ber States assumed unde r the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, their commitments in numerous World Health Assem bly (WHA) resolutions, and their responsibilities to reach the Millenniu m Deve lopme nt Goals (MDGs) by 2015. nts lished a mora l obliga tion among EU Mem ber States to protec t public health and promot e development. Memb er States should ensure that this stance is reflected in trade policies implemented by the Euro pean Com mission. Mem ber States should ensure that aid and trade policies prom oted by the Com mission are coherent and complementa ry, and not only bene fit EU citizens, but also meet the needs of people in developing countries. They should speak up to correct the double standard whereby the EU allows polices that promote commercial interests to undermine its developmen t activities on globa l public health. 7 2 Towards a new consensus on innovation and access In 1995, all countries agreed to the TRIPS Agreement, which imposed a globa l system of IP rules, includin g patent protection for medicin es for at least twen ty years. The TRIPS Agre ement was a major victory for rich countries and the pharma ceutica l industry at WTO negotiations. It represented the single greatest expansion of intellec tual property prote ction in history. Developin g countries voiced serious concerns that the new IP rules woul d delay competi tion from gene ric medicines, resulting in higher price s that would have disas trous consequences for millions. Developin g countries have also found that the administrative costs to implement TRIPS have been particula rly costly.32 Safeg uards unde r the TRIPS Agreement to protect public health, also known as TRIPS flexibilities, were designed to guard against the high prices of patented medicines; provide exceptions to patent monopolies; and ensure early onset of gene ric competition once medicine patents expire. In the decade that followe d the passage of the TRIPS Agreem ent, the multinational phar maceutical industry has fought persisten tly to limit the ability of developin g countries to use these safeguards and flexibilities, which they argue 'steal' their innovation and reduce incentives for new R&D that could benefit developin g countries. While a few developin g countries have managed to use these flexibilities on a limited basis, the efforts of the multinational pharma ceutical industry have historical ly been bolstered by the US government. It has enga ged a variety of strategies to apply pressure on developing countries to prevent them from using the safeguards and in order to introduce additional IP protections. Time for a new approach? Since TRIPS, the rationale for the IP policies prom oted by the pharma ceutical industry has lost credibility. Instead, there is a grow ing consens us among develo ping countries, civilsociety groups, and inter government al organisatio ns that IP rules should be sufficiently flexible to meet public health needs,33 and that alternatives to a patentbased system are needed to stimulate therapeutically valuable innovation.34 The prices of old and new antiretrovi ral medicines indicate the need for a different model (see Box 1). 8 Box 1: Su ccess es and chall enges with HIV and A IDS treatme nt Prices of an ti-retrovira l (ARV) med icines have fallen dr amatically du e to generic competition , which has reduced prices for 'first-line' ARV me dicines from $10 ,000 per patient pe r year to less than $80 for the lowest-price combination .35 But new ARVs, protec ted b y patents and other forms of IP, cost between five and ten times as much as first- line medicines.36 In the absence of pr ice competitio n, they are likely to remain unaffordab le. UNITAID , the global purcha sing facility, has identified the high price of new anti-retro viral medicines an d the lack of innovation for new formula tions and combinations as two ke y barriers to scalin g up H IV and AIDS treatme nt across the de veloping world.37 UNITA ID is work ing to create a mark et for these products, so that prices decr ease while a vailability improves . Deve loping countries now face a growing burden from non commu nicable diseases (NCDs) as well as from infec tious diseases. The WHO estimates that over 80 per cent of all deaths from NCDs today occur in developin g countries. It is clear that, in order to meet health needs in these countries, all disease groups need to be address ed. The fact that globa l IP protection does not deliv er innovation that addresses the needs of developing countries has become unde niable. The WHO Commis sion on Intelle ctual Property, Innovation and Public Health, in a landmark repor t, asserted that 'for diseases affecting millions of poor people in developin g countries, patents are not a relevant factor or effective in stimulating R&D and bringing new prod ucts to the market.'38 Increasing levels of IP protection, it continued, will not reverse the neglect of R&D, noting that 'there is no eviden ce that the implem entation of the TRIPS Agreemen t in developing countries will signific antly boost R&D in pharmaceuticals on Type II, and particula rly Type III diseases .39 Insufficient market incentives are the decisive facto r.'40 IP rules can in fact, inhibit innovation, as excess ive patent ing of both compou nds and research tools hinders followon public and private resea rch. Medicines for neglected diseases accou nt for only one per cent of new chem ical entities reaching the market.41 Although the WHO declared Tuberculosis (TB) a 'global emergency' in 1993, therapies to treat the disease have advan ced little in over nearly two decades. 42 Similar ly, the dearth of new antibiotics should be viewed against the backdrop of an alarmin g rise in resistant infections worldwide that threat en global public health. In gene ral, levels of innovat ion by the pharmaceutical industry have been disapp ointing.43 In recognition of this situation, all countries, including EU Member States, agreed to a comprehensive 'Globa l Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Heal th, Innovation and Intellectual Property' at the WHA in May 2008.44 The strategy promot es measures to increase access to medicines, while exploring new appr oaches to innovat ion, includin g some that are outside an IPbased system. 9 3 Innovation and access within Europe The EU, aware of increased global competi tion, and in particular from emergin g econom ies such as India, has taken steps to protec t its innovative researc hbased industry. These measures lead to higher medicine prices in developin g countries. Yet Member States and the European Commis sion also defen d the interests of European citizens by prote cting them from overcharging by the pharmaceutical indu stry. Improving the affordability of medicines within the EU Many EU Member States use price contr ols and generic prescribing and dispensing to reduc e prices and ensure access to medicines for their popula tions.45 Altho ugh there are 27 different pharmaceutical systems across the EU, 24 out of 27 have price contr ols,46 and nearly all have introduced mechanisms to protect vulnerable groups from excessive outof pocket payments. 47 The Comm ission has also played a role in attempting to ensure fair play through an inqui ry initiated by DG Compet ition in 2008, when it investigated delay ed entry of gene ric medicines into European pharma ceutical markets. The inquiry revealed that IP systems , while playing a role in innovation, contai n perve rse incentives and are often abused. Over the period 2000-07, generic entry of a large number of medicines was delayed by up to seven months each, costing Europe three billion euro.48 Strategies to delay generic competition included: Patent clusters (indivi dual medicines can be covered by almost 100 patent families, resulting in 1,300 patents or pending applic ations in all of the Member States) ; Originato rinitiated litigation against gene rics companies; Originato rinitiated injunctions to delay entry of generic medicines; Bilate ral settlements between originator and generic compani es which limit generic entry of medicin es; Lifecycle ions marketing authorisation of generi cs. The report's findings indicate that the current incentive system for pharma ceutical companies is deeply flawe d. For originato r companies, it is more attractive to invest in marketing and litigation practices than 10 to invest money into R&D.49 DG Compet ition has suggested measures to curtail these practices that include: prohibiting or curtailing thirdparty interventions that lead to delays in generic marketing approval for medicin es; expediting gene ric marketing approval and enforcing deadlines; strengthenin g automatic pricin g and reimbursem ent rules; penalis ing originator companies who question the quality of equivalent generic produc ts; and recommendin g obligato ry proposals indicate that the Comm ission is serious about ensuring that IP rules do not enda nger access to medicin es when its own governments or citizens are paying the bills. Supporting innovation in Europe The European Comm ission has led on a European initiative to foster European R&D through the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a publicprivate partnership with the European Federation of Pharma ceutical Indust ries and Associations (EFP IA). The objective of IMI is to develop knowledge sharing, tools, and methods that will facilitat e the developmen t of better medicines.50 The IMI has a budget of two billion euro for the period 2009-13, with half of the funds coming from the EU and the phar maceutical industry providing the rest. In Septem ber 2009, the IMI announ ced a call for proposals for a secon d round of funding - with nearly 80 million euro from the EU budget. This second round includes funding opportunities to improve R&D for cancer and for other diseases that have high value for the industry. To date, there appea rs to be no assurance that this initiative connec ts with health needs in develo ping countri es. 51 Yet the European Parliament and individual Memb er States have repeatedl y indicated that they support strategies that have a vision beyond Euro pe's interests. Mem ber States seem to have the political will to ensur e that the prices of medicines do not compromise access to medicines within their borders, and are prepa red to negotiate with the pharma ceutical industry to this end. Further more, the EC has developed initiatives to promot e access and innovation in the EU, including explicitly curtaili ng excesses of the IP system . This stands in sharp contr ast with DG Trade's policy towa rds other countries and reeks of an unjust double standard. 11 4 IP and trade: a boon for the pharmaceutical industry Until recentl y, the US government was willing to impose sufficiently strict levels of IP protection (TRIPSplus rules) on developing countries in order to serve the interests of the originator pharmaceutical industry . TRIPSplus rules excee d minimum WTO obligations and create new barriers that impede access to medicines in developing countries.52 However, recent chang es to US trade policy have left the multinational pharmaceutical indust ry without a reliable partner. The evidence indicates that the EU has stepped in to fulfil this role, imposi ng demands that exceed those previously pursue d by the US governm ent.53 So far, this new role has not been countered by strong opposition from the EU Member States. How EU Trade policy harms access to medicines Competen ce to formul ate and impl ement EU trade polic y, includin g on IP, is delegat ed to the European Commi ssion on behal f of EU Mem ber States, including external IP policy. The strategy pape r 'Global Europe',54 aimed at maximising the compet itivene ss of Euro pean companies abroad, provides the fram ework within which the EU pursues its IP policy. To this end, the EU has focused on extending monopoly prote ction for patented medicin es in developin g countries, while limiting the ability of developin g countries to use TRIPS safeguards to protect public health. Strategies used by the EU include free trade agreemen ts, bilater al pressur e, and enforcement rules. In its defen ce, the European Comm ission likes to mention its adheren ce to the Doha Declara tion on TRIPS and Public Health, as well as a tiered pricin g policy to improve access in developin g countries.55 Yet its reference to the Doha Declaration is often an empty gesture, as it does not overcome its parallel efforts to impose stringent IP rules upon developing countries. These parallel efforts run directly counter to the spirit and intent of the Doha Declaration. Furthermor e, tiered or differential pricin g, while supported by Oxfam as one meas ure to improve access, has been barely used by pharmaceut ical companies, and there is no consensus that tiered pricin g can ensur e sustainable access, by itself, in the long term.56 12 1 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) Having failed to introduce stricter IP rules at the WTO, the pharma ceutical industry now relies heavily on litigation, lobbying, FTAs, and other agreement s57 to impose TRIPSplus rules in developin g countries. A series of bilater al and regiona l FTAs with such rules is another means of pushing for upward harm onization of stringent IP rules globally. As recently as 2004, EU Mem ber States were adamantly against FTAs with TRIPSplus rules. At the 2004 Worl d AIDS Conference, the French President, Jacques Chirac, decla red that effort s by the USA to sign an FTA with Thailan d would severely affect access to antiretroviral medicines and was 'tantamoun t to blackmail '.58 Yet the EU has now evolved into a champi on of these same agreements, pursuing regiona l and bilateral FTAs with developin g countries such as Colom bia, Peru, India, the Cent ral American trading bloc, and the ASEAN59 countri es. In these negotiations the EU has attempted to implement the following TRIPSplus provisions:60 Signific antly enhancing prote ction for clinical trial data by providing up to 11 years of exclusive use of such data to obtain marketin g approva l (also known as data exclusivity61), effective ly prolonging monopoly prote ction for medicines;62 Extending patent monopolies through supplementary prote ction certificates (SPC) (also known as patent extensions);63 Introducing enforcement measures which potential ly obstruct the import, transit, or export of legitimate gene ric medicines.64 The EU has also failed to make any commitments , through FTAs or otherwis e, on promo ting to countries.65 The Comm has defended its approac h to FTAs by notin g its impl ementati on of the 'Paragraph 6 Amendment' of the Doha Declara tion on TRIPS and Public Health and its inclusion of the Paragraph 6 amendment in the IP chapter of FTA texts. The Paragraph 6 Amen dment was intended to find an appropriate solution to ensure that countries with insufficient or no domestic manufacturin g capacity could import gene ric medicines unde r a compulsory license. This has been deeme d mostly unworkable, and a 'solution wrapped in red tape'. In fact, the Paragraph 6 Amen dment , despite its implementat ion in the EU since 2006, has not been used once in the EU, and has only been used once through Cana dian legislation, to export antiretroviral medicines to Rwan da.66 The Amendm ent is not a substitute for generic prod uction of medicines , and gene ric medicines exported under Paragraph 6 cannot be exported to developing countries that do not qualify as LDC s. 13 IP rules in EU FTAs have provoked fierce resista nce. Recently, the Andean commu nity trade negotiation fell apart when Ecuador and Bolivi a left the negotiation due in large part to concerns that strict IP rules would restrict access to medicin es. Nevertheless, the EU has press ed on with negotia tions to enforce strict IPRs with the remain ing Andean countri es. 67 Developing countries are right to be concerned. Prospective and retrospective impact studies confirm that TRIPSplus rules threat en access to affordable medicines. Over time, these measures will have dramatic public health conseq uences in developing countries (see Box 2). Box 2: Pu blic he alth i mpacts of free trade agreements FTA Source Public health impact EU- Colombia FTA* IFARM A prospective study commissioned by HA I Europ e. By 2030 , patent term exten sions could result in an increase of nea rly $280m in expenditures for med icines. Data exclusivity rules could result in an increas e of more than $340m o f expenditures on medicines. Patent e xtensio ns and da ta exclusivity mi ght jointly res ult in an increase in e xpenditure of more than $620m.

This led to between two- and ten- fold price increases for key med icines to treat cardiovas cular disease and c ancer. The availability of generic equivalents would have reduced expenditures on medicines by at least an estimated $6 .3-$22.05m d uring the stud y period from mid-2002 to 2006. US- Guatemala FTA (CAFTA) Centre for Polic y Anal ysis on Trade and Health An FT A signe d between the USA and Guatemala , Honduras, Nica ragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Dominican Republic has led to significa nt de lays in generic competition in Guatemala for medicines ne eded to treat major causes of morbidity and mortality, including diabetes, hea rt disease, pn eumonia, and HIV an d AIDS. Th is led to increases in medicine pric es ranging from 2 to 58 times the cost o f the generic equ ivalent. Dela ys in generic competition resulted in the introduction o f generic competitors in the USA pr ior to their in troduction in the Guatemalan market. * Prospectiv e impacts of the EU-Peru FTA, employing the same methodology, are similar to findings in Colombia. These studies were commissi oned during the EU-Andean community trade negoti ations. After objections by an alliance of Lati n Amer ican and E uropean civil soci ety,69 and the coun tries in question, TRIPS-plus rules have been modi fied to reduce public health impacts on negotiating pa rtners. 14 Furthermore, strict IP rules that exceed minimum WTO obligations have limited or no economic benefi ts for poor countries as innovation based economies tend to grow through imitation at lower levels of economic development.70 Historically, develope d countries only implem ented the IP rules the EU seeks to impose on developing countries once they had attained far higher levels of economic developmen t.71 Impacts of new FTAs can extend beyond the border s of those countries that sign an agreem ent. An EU agreement with India would be particula rly harmful, because India plays a key role as the 'pharmacy of the developing world', exporting 67 per cent by volume of the medicines its gene ric compani es manufacture to developing countries, and providing over 80 percent of the world's generic antiretrovir al medicines. If India signed an FTA with the EU contain ing the harmful demands indicated above , access to medicines in poor countries would be in jeopardy. Not least affected would be EU Memb er States and the EU, which purchase key medicines for HIV and AIDS destined for developing countries through bilateral and multilater al financi ng instruments. 2 Bilateral pressure to eliminate TRIPS flexibilities The EU introduced a 'Watc h List' in 2006, emulating the US 'Specia l 301 Watch List', which is used to press ure developin g countries that fail to comply with high levels of IP prote ction as preferred by the EU. The EC is using the Watch List to pressur e countries with which it intends to conclude trade agreeme nts. It does this by noting the alleged deficien cies in those countries' IP framewor ks that could be remedied through an FTA. The list is currently being updat ed, and will provide a term for rightsholding compani es to charge countries that are, in their judgment, not doing enough to enforce IPRs.72 Other bilateral pressur e is also applied. Though specifically permit ted by the TRIPS Agreem ent and reaffirmed in the Doha Decla ration, ies, and governments daring to issue such licences are censured. By issuing a compulsory licence, a gove rnment authorises the prod uction and marketing of a cheap er generic version of a patente d medicine on the condition that an authorised generi c firm pays a licence fee to the patent holder. A compulsory licence, or even the mere threat of one, will typically cause substantial decreases in the price of a given medicine. Yet few countries use compulsory licensing, despite high medicine prices, for fear of retaliation. Prior efforts by Thailand73 and Brazil to use compulsory licensing were met with press ure by both developed countries and the mult inational pharmaceutical industry.74 The European Comm ission's recent effort to curtail Thailan d's use of compulsory licensing is an exam ple of such pressur e (see Box 3). 15 Box 3: EC pressure on Thaila nd's use of compulso ry licen sing Thailand has used compulsory licensing to reduce high medicine prices and expand treatment for cancer, HIV and AIDS, an d cardiovascular dis ease through the country's public health system. Withou t lower prices, ne ither the government n or most of its citizens would be ab le to purchase these medicines. Multina tional companies, the USA, and the EC ha ve placed co- ordinated pressure on the Thai go vernment to abando n its e fforts. The previous EC Trade Commissioner, Peter Mandelson , wrote to the T hai Minister of Co mmerce to complain about the Tha i government's use of compulsory licences.75 Since then , the EC has entered into F TA negotia tions with Th ailand (as part o f ASEAN) with the intention to introduce TRIPS-p lus rules tha t would dela y gener ic competition and pre vent the Thai government from using public health safeguards, such as compulsory licensing. The bilateral pressure exerted by the EC se ems to have had the desired effect. Currently, the new Tha i government is considering refo rms to its IP policy t hat would scale back ma ny of the gains o f recent years.76 3 The IP enforcement agenda Rewarding pharmaceutical com panies un der t he guise of prom oting patient safety The EU is taking the lead in a global offensive to increase enforcement of IP under the banner of combating counterfei ting through new global rules that could, if implemented, serious ly undermine access to affordable generi c medicines.77 Under the TRIPS Agreemen t, enforcement of IP is to a large extent left to the discretion of each WTO member. Yet the EU, alongside others, is seeking to introduce an international regulatory framewo rk for enforcem ent.78 Cynic ally, the European Commis has sought to justify new enforcem ent meas ures by claiming that the new rules will save lives in poor countries by halting the trade in 'counterfeit ' medicin es.79 In reality, enforcement rules could unde rmine efforts to identify and remove dange rous medicines in developing countries. Scarce resources could be directed to enforce IP rules on behalf of pharm aceutical companies, instead of being used to ensure quality of medicines.80 The deli berate confusion surroundi ng counterfeit s and generi cs The WHO defines counterfeit medicines as deliberately mislabelled prod ucts with respect to identi ty or source. If a medical product is not mislabelled, it is not a counte rfeit.81 As such, counterfeit medicines are often, but not always, medicin es that wilfully infringe a trademark, which is a type of IP distinc t from a patent. It is not the IP status of a medicine that determines the quality or safety of a medicine.82 Arresting the trade in counterfeit medicin es is a legitimate aim, and counterfeit medicines do pose a threat to public health. Howev er, the issue of counterf eiting has been confl ated with the wider issue of quality and safety. The dominant threat to public health in developin g 16 countries is the broader problem of substandard, adulte rated, and contam inated medicines that can be either branded or gene ric medicines.83 This probl em cannot be adequately addressed by only policing mislabelled medicin es. Halting the trade in unsa fe and dange rous medicines requires bette r regulation of the pharma ceutical supply chain from prod ucer to end user, for which it is particularly important to stren gthen drug regulatory author ities in developin g countries.84 How ever, the European Comm ission now asserts that it is necessary to review all legitimate generic medicin es of guaranteed quality for infringemen ts of the Commun ity's IP rules, to ensur e the medicines are safe.85 With this appr oach, the EU has opened the door to state sponsored harassment of the legal trade in quality gene ric medicin es. The approach cham pioned by the European Commi ssion supp orts only the narrow interests of the mult inational pharmaceutical industry and ignores major and legitimate concerns put forwar d by developin g countries, civilsociety groups, and pharma ceutical experts. Seizing generi c medi cines int ended for developing countri es To stren gthen its own enforce ment regime on IP, the EC has implem ented regulations that empower customs officials to seize medicines suspected of infringing its IP rules.86 Under the TRIP S Agreem ent, IP rules are defined at the national level by each country consistent with minimum obligat ions under WTO rules.87 By applying EC rules at the border via the enforce ment agenda, the EC is imposi ng its internal IP standards on the rest of the world. In doing so, the EC is obstructin g comm ercial channels for generic medicines across the world, which has enorm ous consequences for public health. In particular, an EU customs regulation, amended in 2003, expanded the authority of customs officials beyond trademarks and copyri ght infringemen t to include patent infringement.88 Thus, under the amended regulation, customs officials, at the behest of pharmaceutical companies, make patent (and trademark) assess ments at the border for medicines that are either being imported, exported or are 'intransit ' through an EU port. These meas ures, justified as a way to curb counterfeiting and the spread of dang erous medicines, in effect place border and customs officials at the service of the multinational pharma ceutical industry - enforcin g IP on its beha lf. This chan nels state resources towa rds the enforcem ent of all IP, irrespective of whether the IP claim is legitimate in the first place. Although companies are entitled to pursue legitimate concerns with respect to IP violations, it should be their responsibility to do so through the courts in the country of origin or destination. The new power s have led to seizures of legitimate gene ric medicines in trans it through the EU and intended for developing countri es, to treat diseases such as HIV and AIDS, cardiovascular diseases , and common infections. The seizures are a chilling illustration of the possible 17 consequ ences of border measures implemented on a globa l scale (see Box 4). Box 4: Seiz ures of legitimate generic m edici nes in tended for poor countries Since late 2008, customs officials in the Netherlands a nd Germany have seized 19 shipments o f legitima te generic medicines . Of the shipments, 18 were legally manufactured and e xported from India (and one ship ment from China) and intended for developing coun tries where the y could be legally imported .89 Patents did not exist on the medicines in either the countr y of origin or destination . These shipmen ts were seized as a result of na tional implemen tation of the EU re gulation . Even though the medicines we re in transit, and thus not in tended for domes tic consumptio n in the EU, border officials in bo th countries seized the med icines because the y viola ted IP protections in the EU. Medicines tha t were seized inclu ded a cardio vascular disease medicine (Losarta n) intended for Brazil,90 and a key anti-retro viral medicine, (Ab acavir) in tended for Nigeria . The an ti-retroviral medicine was produced in India and paid for by UNIT AID, a med icine purchasing facility funded in large part through aid from the UK and throu gh an a irline tax levied in Fran ce.91 After pub lic outcries and pressure by the countries in question, the batch o f Losa rtan was e ventually sent ba ck to India , while the batch o f Abacavir was relea sed and sent on to Nigeria . These seizures have gene rated condemnation from civil society groups, intergovernmental organisat ions, and UNITA ID. The Indian government has indicated that it is likely to file a complaint befor e the WTO Dispute Settlemen t Body to declare the EU anticounterfeiting regulation illegal .92 EU Member States have expressed concer n. The Dutch government has been particularly vocal towards the Comm ission , as nearly all seizures of medicines intended for developing countries have occur red at its main airport. Initially, the response of the EC was of meas ured defiance , with DG Trade going so far as to say that other countries should be 'grateful to the EU for saving lives'.93 More recently, the EC has signa lled that it may be willing to change its approach.94 Globali sing enforcement r ules The EU is aggressively seeking to extend TRIPSplus rules globally by export ing its IP enforcem ent meas ures through FTAs with developin g countries - via efforts at mult ilateral organ isations like the WHO and the Worl d Intellectua l Property Organisation (WIPO), and separately through the negotiations of the AntiCounte rfeit Trade Agreement (ACTA). The implement ation of these meas ures will force developin g countries to channel government resources into prote cting the trademarks and patents of multinational pharmaceutical companies . As such, enforcing private rights will place a significant burden on developing countries and impede countries seeking to addr ess more press ing public policy priorities.95 Generic compani es would be less able to challenge frivolous patents and would fear seizures of their 18 medicines. Unde r such a fram ework, the position of the IP rightsholder would be strengthened, to the detri ment of gene ric competitors, effectively leadi ng to extended monopolies for medicines in developing countries. As part of a broader framework, and as mentioned earlier, the EU is pursuing ACTA , which is currently a plurilateral trade negotiation betwe en 12 countries and the EU Member States, represented by the EC and the EU presidency. The Agreem ent has the express purpose of developing and implem enting a multilateral IP enforcement scheme. ents Under Discussion'96 concerning injunc tions, border measures, criminal penalties, and enforce ment practices suggests the Agreem ent may seek to introduce the same polici es that have obstructed and deterred legitimate gene ric compet ition within the borders of the EU. This would include introducing criminal and finan cial penalties for violations of patents, and even go so far as to hold manufacturers of active pharma ceutical ingredients (APIs) liable for counterfeiting and enforcement violations. Howev er, verifying the true intent, scope, and purpose of ACTA is impossible, because all negotiating parties, including the EU, refuse to release the text to public scrutiny. Where is the dissent? The EU's IP policies promoted by DG Trade undermine the efforts of other Directorates within the European Comm ission, and the efforts of EU Mem ber States at a national level, to promote access to health care in developin g countries. Yet, even as the actua l and potential harm to these polic ies continues to grow, concerns by EU Mem ber States and other Directorates within the Comm ission, with few exceptions, rema in In recent years, Oxfam Internat ional has appla uded the efforts of the Comm ission to strength en health care systems in developing countries (the EU is a major funder of health care in developing countries). As part of the EU develo pment agenda, its funding contribu tes to finan cing healthsector and gene ral budget support. Such polic ies enable governments to expand public health services for poor peopl e. Secto r budg et support also strengthens gove rnments' capacity to plan and implem ent national priorities and recurrent costs such as recruiting and paying salaries for health workers - a key strategy to ensure access to medicin es. The EU has also contribu ted to donors' coordination mechan isms at the country level via sector wide approaches (SWAPs). This leads to the pooling of donor resources to ensure improved funding for public health services, includin g medicines. The funds from the EU budget also contr ibute to financ ing the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria, which funds twothirds of global Mala ria and TB programmes, including paying for medicines. Alongside these efforts, EU Mem ber States have implemented programmes to improve 19 access to medicin es in developin g countries.97 In gene ral, desp ite these stron g financ ial commitments to global health, trade policies that would ensure access to medicines have not yet followed. In recent months, DG Development has led efforts to define policies on the EU's role in Global Health which should include recommendations on how to improve internal and external coher ence related to trade and access to medicin es. The European Parliament, through resolutions, recommendations, and letters, has communicated its concerns on trade agreements and access to medicin es in developin g countries.98 Yet, no ground swell of action has followed. Only a few Mem ber States have repeate dly voiced concern (including the Netherl ands, Finland and the UK99). Without pressure from Mem ber States for the DG Trade to chan ge course, the steady march toward s stricter IP rules in developing countries will continue unabated, with poten tially devas tating consequ ences for peop le living in poverty. 20 5 R&D: The positive, the inadequate, and the harmful EU policies and those of Mem ber States to improve innovation in order to meet health needs in developing countries are a mixed bag of positive, inadequat e, and harm ful policies and practices. The positive: R& D programmes hav e improv ed innovation for developing countries Despite an overall shortfall in financing for R&D for developing countries (see below), the finan cial disbursements that the EU has made are often spent on valuable and effect ive prog rammes. For instance, Oxfam Internationa l has previously lauded the European Clini cal Trials and Development Partnership (ECTDP) for devoting financia l resources (200 million euro) to improving clinical trial capacity - a key componen t of medica l R&D - in subSaharan Africa.100 The EU has also taken crucial steps to improve the safety of children's medicines with respect to studies that relate dosa ges to age and weight. The lack of such studies has resulted in doctors and nurses having to split adult tablets into fractions, with the consequence of harmful unde r and overdosing to children, based on little more than guess work on the part of the prescribers.101 To address this defici ency, in 2007, the European Medicines Regul atory required that all new produc ts subm itted for licensing in the EU must go through clinical trials in children.102 The implications of the new rules should not be unde restimated, as studies must be done in all age and weight bands. This is a very considerable undertaking, which involves substantial extra costs . Howe ver, the regulation compensates companies by allowing an extended patent term.103 Extende d patent prote ction can lead to delays in generic competi tion, thus reducing access in developin g countries. The inadequate: EU finan cial contributions for R&D fall short Over the last decade, some avenues to impr ove R&D for poor people have emerged, including: PDPs, which are funded by a mix of public and private resources; clinical trial and manufacturin g facilities in developing countries; and basic academic and laboratory research. 21 In gross terms in 2007, according to a recent report release d by the George Institute, the EU spent approximately $121m on R&D, while both the Commiss ion and EU Mem ber States collectively invested nearly $385m.104 While this is seem ingly a considerable sum of money, it is still insufficient, especially when compared with annual financia l contributions by the USA and even the Gates Foundation.105 Although recent studies have demonstrate d that the EU is more produc tive than the USA in terms of overall R&D for medicines, funding for neglected diseases still lags far behind. Insufficient funding has immediate implications for global health. Recent figures from the Treat ment Action Group indicate a globa l funding shortfa ll of nearly $800m per year for TB R&D.106 Underfunding of PDPs may mean that, 'the eight or nine drug s that PDPs might be expected to bring to market in the next five years will stay where they are - in the pipeline.'107 The har mful: T he EU is im peding pr ogres s at the WHO to explor e new models of innovation w hich meet health needs in the developing world In 2006, the WHO launched a process to develop a public health consens us among all Member States to impr ove both innovation and access to medicin es, especially in devel oping countries. At the 2008 World Health Assembly (WHA), Member States agreed on a Globa l Strategy and Plan of Action that would mandate WHO to address critical barriers to innovation and access in developing countries. At times during negotiations , the EU played an unconstructive role. It opposed reaffirmat ion of the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, or that public health must be prioritized over comm ercial interests. It also wanted to prevent the WHO from asserting that middleincome and developin g countries shall have the right to implem ent TRIPS flexibilities to either import or prod uce generic versions of new medicines.108 Finally, at the 2008 WHA , the EU blocked inclusion of WHO as a stakeholder for the design of a new Essential Health and R&D treaty that seeks to enhance standardsettin g for globa l health and to explore new models of finan cing and innovation.109 22 6 Conclusion and recommendations An emerging consensus requires governments to promote and protect the right to health, including the provision of essential medicines. This responsibilit y cannot be trade d away to accommodate the comme rcial interests of mult inational pharm aceutical companies. Developing countries are facing increased risks to public health which includ e: a worsening burden of infectious diseases such as HIV and AIDS, TB, and pneumonia; an increasing challenge from NCD s; and continuing prevalence of untreated neglected diseases. With the change of Commission, these realit ies provide the context for a reexamination by the EU as to the incoherence of its trade polices with deve lopme nt objectives. Where these policies favour the Union's interest s at the expense of the health of poor people in developing countries, the policies of the EU must change. For the EU to curb IP abuses by the pharm aceutical industry within the Union while press ing for more onerous IP protection in deve loping countries, amounts to an unacce ptable double standard. The EU is imposing a trade agenda that enables pharm aceutical companies to stren gthen their monopoly powers, resulting in delayed generi c competitio n and higher medicines prices in developing coun tries. This is inconsistent with its own deve lopment agenda, which has a long and successful record of support for health care in developing countries, backed by the European Parliament and the Member States. These policies also undermine the oblig ations undertaken by the EC and Memb er States when they commi tted thems elves to reaching the MDGs, the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, and the WHO Global Strategy and Plan of Action. They are inconsistent with the spirit and substance of much beneficial assistance to the health of people living in poor countries. And they go some way towards negatin g the political and financial support that EU Member States and the EC itself have contribut ed to improve innovation and access in developing countries. The EU is not committing sufficient resources to catalyze medical innovat ion on behalf of deve loping countries, and is cynically blocking progress at WHO to build a political consensus towards new models of innovation to addres s urgent health needs in deve loping countries. Member States and the European Parliament must use their powe rs to ensure that the new Europea n Commission radically reforms its policies. To accom plish these reforms, Oxfa m Inter national and Health Action International recommend the following: 1. The Europea n Com mission and EU Mem ber States should honour commitments under the 23 MDGs, the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, and relevant World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions on innovation and access to medicines, including full implementation of the WHO 'Global Strategy and Plan of Action'. 2. The EU should ensu re its trade policy is in line with its lopme nt objec tives, including specif ically enha ncing access to health care and access to medicines. This includes ensuring that trade rules, whether multilateral, regional, or bilate ral, exclude essential public services such as education, health, and water and sanitation from liberalization commitments.110 EU Member States must act to hold the EC accountable when the EC fails to uphold these principles. 3. With respect to IP: The EU and Membe r States should not misuse FTAs to introduce TRIPSplus IP rules in deve loping countries to extend monopoly protection and introduce new enforc ement measures, whic h limit access to medicines. The Europe an Commission should stop exerting pressure on governmen ts that attempt to introduce safeguards and flexibilities to protect and promot e public health. The Europe an Commission should amend its counterfeiting regulation to ensure it does not have a detrimenta l impac t on developing countries, by excluding border measures for violations of pharmace utical patents, especially for medicines in transit. The EU should ensure that the AntiCounterfeiting Trade Agreem ent (ACTA) does not set a new global standard for intellect ual property rules (IPR) that imped es access to medicines in developing countries. Therefore, the EU should ensu re that patents are excluded from any agreed framework. The Europe an Commission and Member States should identify and support other measures to impro ve access to generic medicines in developing countries, including the UNITAID patent pool for HIV and AIDS medicines. 4. With respect to R&D: Europea n donors, includin g the Commission, shou ld scale up financial contributions to R&D to address diseases that disproportionate ly affect people living in deve loping countries, especially through alternative funding mechanisms that promot e therapeutic innovation. The EU should also support Product Development Partnerships (PDPs) that are designe d to deliver affordab le and effective new produc ts, and it should continue building R&D capacity in deve loping countries. The EU should support the implemen tation of the World Health Organization's Global Strategy and Plan of Action (GSPA) on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property, and support the Expert Working Group in its efforts to explore new models of innovation that increase both innovation and access. The Europe an Commission should take appropriate measures to ensure that specific initia tives such as the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) meet real health needs, and that both the IMI and the EUs regulation on children's medicines can also be to the benefit of deve loping countries. 24 Notes 1 WHO (2006) 'WH O, Public Health, Innova tion and Intellectual Prop erty Rights: Report of the Commission on Intellectua l Prop erty Right, Innovation, and Publ ic Health', Geneva: W HO, p 21-4. 2 'More than 4 million HIV-positive people now The World Health Organ ization now estima tes 80% of all deaths fro m non- communi cable diseases occur in developing countries today .

Type II diseases are incident in both rich and po or co untries, bu t with a substan tial proportion of the cases in the poor countries. HIV/AID S and tuberculosis are examples: bo th diseases are present in both rich and poor coun tries, bu t more than 26 90 percent of cases are in poor coun tries. Type III di seases are those that are overwhelmin gly or exclusively inciden t in developing coun tries, such as African sleeping sickness (try panosomia sis) and African river blindness (onchocerciasis). Such diseases re ceive extremely little R& D, and essentially no comme rcially based R&D in rich coun tries.

From a med icinal or public 27 health perspective, however, a product might not be innovative at all, because it adds little therapeutic value when compared with simila r existing medicines. Acco rding to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 487 new products received market au thorisations in the USA between 1998 and 20 03, of which 78 % where by and large similar to previously authorised medicines. On ly 14% displayed a marked therape utic improvemen t. (FDA Report, quoted in Neue Z\u00fcricher Zeitung, 14/15 May 2005 ).

This guide describes the IPRIA (Intellectual property rights impact assessmen t) mode l. The IPRIA has been applied in different contexts to various countries, and the most recent applications have been carried out within the framework of a consortium of organizations in cluding the WHO, the PAHO, the World Bank Insti tute and the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (I CTSD), who have refined the met hodology. Some of the applications carried out are: Colombia (2005 , 2006, 2007), Guatemala (2005), Costa Rica (2005), Bo livia (2006), Costa Rica (200 8), Dominican Repub lic (200 8), Uruguay and Argen tina.

Latin Ame rican civil socie ty, led by Misio n Salud, called in the help of European civil society out of concern for IP demands and their experience with the US FT A. NGOs included are: AISLAC, Mision Salud, RED RED and role of techn ology in development follo ws a fairly stan dard path, described by one UN report as 'a developed , innovating \"North\" and a devel oping, imitating \"South\"'. All coun tries initially grow by imitating and adapting existing techno logies. As the y approach the glob al 'techno logical frontier', they move into innovation. One of the re asons why countries such as Ch ina or India, that are in 'catch-up' mode, grow so much faster than the industrialised countries is that adapting existing technologies is much easier than creating new ones. 71 Historically , IP legislation has fo llowed development: as co untrie s have grown richer, and as they evolve from imitation to innovation, they have introduced more stringent IP laws. Chemical substances re mained un-patentable until 1967 in West Germany , 1968 in the Nordic countries, 197 6 in Japan, 1978 in Switzerlan d, and 1992 in Spain (by which time, their chemical industries had estab lished themsel ves). This pattern was broken over the past twenty years by a combination of new institutions such as the WTO and regional trade agreements, and an extra ordinarily aggressive campai gn by large corporations and their home-coun try governments. 72 See European Commission (2008) 'Survey on Enforcement of Intellectual Prope rty Rights in Third Countries'.

Substanda rd pharma ceuticals are products whose composition and ingredients d o not me et the cor rect scientific specifications and which may be either ineffective or dangerous to the patient. It is therefore a public health proble m that has a limited relationship with trade mark law and a very marginal relationship with patent law. As it has been demonstra ted elsewhere, on ly one percent of 'coun terfei ts' are exact copies of original products and could, in consequence, and assuming that the original product was paten ted, imply a patent infringement. T he rest of cases involve trademark violations and much more importantly, quality shortco mings.

The following recommend ations were given to the EC by the EP in 2008 in the context of the negotiations with the Andean communi ty: i)Using negotiating guidelines on development coop eration designe d to achieve MDGS, in cluding the protection of pu blic health, ii) ensuring co herence of development policies in line with the principle enshrined in Article 178 of the EC Treaty, iii) granting high priority for greater access to education and health, iv) foste ring regional integration by negotiating block b y block , see X. Seuba , (2009) 'Pro tection Health in the EU Ande an trade agreement', Hai paper serie s. These recommendations are in conflict with the EC's stand on limiting TRIPS 30 flexibilities and the one-sided perspective of IPR holders. Furthermore, the EC has engage d in bilateral agreements, excludi ng some of the Andean countries, as happen ed in the ACP coun tries. In the Council Working Group C 133 on trade matters, the se coun tries have voiced concern over DG Trade's IP policy and its im pact on ac cess to medicines in developing coun tries. 100 Oxfam International (2008) 'Ending the R+D Crisis in Publi c Receive tml 101 'Children being Diseases Re search much are we really spen ding?', G-Fi nder Report, The Geo rge Institute For International Health, 2008. 105 Ibid. 106 Treatment Action Group (2009 ) 'Tuberculosis Re search and Developmen t: A C ritical Analy sis of TB: The Underfunding of Research for Tuberculosis and other Neglected Diseases by the European Commission', M\u00e9decin s San s Fronti\u00e8res (20 08). 107 M.

Antibiotic resistance is an increasingly serious probl em, and has been identified as a priority by the Swedish presidency. Antibiotic resista nce poses many challenges, including the treatment of Tuberculosis (T B). One of the most pressing challenges is stimulating new TB diagno stics an d medi cines.
