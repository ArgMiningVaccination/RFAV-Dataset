ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AGENCY STAFF Rebecca Gebhart, Interim Agency Director James Nguyen, Interim Finance and Administration DirectorConnie Soriano, Administrative Specialist IIFY 2014/15 Measure A Executive Summary ABOUT THE MEASURE A O VERSIGHT COMMITTEE One of the provisions of Measure A required the establishment of a Citizen Oversight Committee. The Committee's role is to annually review Measure A expenditures for each fiscal year and report to the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board) on whether such expenditures conform to the purposes set forth in the measure. The Measure states: \"The citizen oversight committee shall annually review the expenditure of the essential health care services tax fund for the prior year and shall report to the board of supervisors on the conformity of such expenditures. \" The Oversight Committee spent several months reviewing allocation reports, convening and deliberating concerns, communicating concerns to providers, highlighting provider accomplishments, and reviewing and editing the Measure A report. As part of this process, the Committee used the report forms returned by most Measure A fund recipients, along with information from several provider presentations, to review all funding allocations. OVERALL CONCLUSION The Oversight Committee found that Alameda Health System (AHS) and other recipients of the sales tax revenue spent the funds in compliance with the provisions of Measure A. The Oversight Committee did have concerns for a small number of allocations. These concerns are noted in this Executive Summary and in the individual report summaries for the relevant providers. History of the Measure Measure A, the Essential Health Care Services Initiative, was passed by 71% of Alameda County voters in March 2004. In June 2014, 76% of voters passed Measure AA, which extended the initiative through 2034. Both measures authorize the County of Alameda to raise its sales tax by one-half cent to provide additional financial support for emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County . A AA 3Measure A generated $132,429,279* in FY 14/15. Highlights Since the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2014, more than 40,000 newly eligible County residents have been enrolled into the state's Medi-Cal program, and more than 64,000 residents have been enrolled in Covered California. Despite these achievements to increase the number of individuals who have health insurance, an estimated 158,734 individuals, or 10.1% of County residents, remain uninsured, according to the American Community Survey data for 2015. Thus, Measure A revenues continue to play a critical role in helping indigent, uninsured, and low income residents of Alameda County\u2014who depend on the County's health care safety net\u2014maintain access to essential health services. With regard to Measure A recipient reporting, the Committee recognizes an ongoing trend of improvement in the quality and level of detail in the reporting process compared to prior years. This is due in part to the ongoing effort of the Committee and the Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) to improve the accountability of Measure A recipients byDISTRIBUTION OF MEASURE A FUNDS 25% 75%Of the $132,429,279 that Measure A generated in FY 14/15, AHS received 75% and the remainder of the funds was distributed by the Board to many health care providers who provide essential health care services. 14%40% 15%14%17%Behavioral Services Acute Ambulatory Services Primary Care26% 24% 30% 20%Hospital, Tertiary Care, Other the Board of Supervisors Measure A Funding Approved by Allocati on of Measure A Funds toAlameda Health $99.3 million* Does not include interest earned. ** Board allocations are made in advance of a given fiscal year. Therefore, the amount generated by Measure A for that year does not equal the amount allocated by the Board. 4implementing a Results-Based Accountability framework to help providers report measurable performance data that describes the effort, quality, and impact of their programs and services. Large Numbers Served, Wide Geographic Reach Measure A funds continue to support the health and well-being of large numbers of County residents. AHS alone served 156,330 County residents through Measure A in FY 14/15, while the Alameda County Public Health Department Public Health Prevention Initiative served over 200,000. In addition, Measure A contributes to positive outcomes for residents throughout the County, with recipient providers located in every Supervisory District. Mental Health/Behavioral Health Services More than just physical health, a great number of Measure A providers used their allocation to achieve positive mental and behavioral health outcomes for the target population. For example, everyone in the Abode Services Greater HOPE program has been connected with mental health services and housing support services, with over 75% of clients reporting decreased psychiatric hospital stays and/or criminal justice involvement. At the new Schreiber Center, clients receiving therapy and psychiatric services have shown an overall decrease in symptoms of depression, reduced side effects of medications, improved communication with family, increased access to mental health services, and improved care with current providers following the recommendations of a psychiatrist. Youth Outcomes A number of providers reported on improved mental and behavioral health outcomes for youth. The Center for Healthy Schools and Communities School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative reported that students who received group or individual services presented statistically significant improvements in life functioning (43%), behavioral/emotional needs (24%), and school success (34%) from intake to discharge. Youth participating in the Mind Body Awareness program at the Juvenile Justice Center revealed a significant decrease (20.4%) in perceived stress, a significant increase in healthy self-regulation (19.6%), and a significant increase in self-esteem (14.1%) from pre to post testing. A behavioral health assessment used by half of the community-based organizations in the Youth and Family Opportunity initiative revealed significant improvement in client behavioral/emotional needs (34.4%), life functioning (40.5%), school (39.9%), and child strengths (27.6%). Program Stabilization Measure A funds contribute to stabilization of health care service delivery in the face of cuts from other funding sources. For example, despite AHS alone served 156,330 County residents through Measure A in FY 14/15, while the Alameda County Public Health Department Public Health Prevention Initiative served over 200,000 . 5$26.3 millionsignificant reductions in County General Funds available to support behavioral health services, Measure A funds helped Behavioral Health and Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Community organizations maintain a higher level of access to services for uninsured and health care safety net populations. Specifically, only a minimal change occurred when comparing the total number of unique clients served during this year across the behavioral health system with the number of clients served last year across providers receiving Measure A funds. Leveraged Funding A large number of Measure A recipients leveraged their allocations to receive matching funds from other sources. For the 25% of Measure A funds allocated by the Board, recipients leveraged their allocations to obtain a total of $26.3 million in matching funds. Thus, every $1 in Measure A funds to these recipients returned $0.75 in matching funds. For some recipients, the matching funds represented a return greater than 1:1. Safe Alternatives to Violent Environments (SAVE) obtained over $80,000 in matching funds on its $30,000 Measure A allocation. Fremont Aging and Family Services obtained almost $200,000 in matching funds on its $52,000 Measure A allocation. Most dramatically, the School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative obtained $6,216,000 in matching funds on its $617,000 Measure A allocation, while the School Health Centers obtained over $10,000,000 in matching funds on an allocation of just under $2,000,000. Agency Collaboration Measure A funding encouraged provider collaboration with other agencies to improve health care outcomes. The Detoxification/Sobering Center expanded its collaboration with mental health providers, including John George Psychiatric Hospital, crisis services, Highland Hospital, local medical clinics, and law enforcement. These partnerships had a significant positive impact on the clients and families served, allowing for increased referral capability, increased collaborative consultation and training, and a warm hand-off for clients to and from multiple levels of the health care system. Exceeding Targets Many Measure A recipients exceeded their target numbers for clients served, sometimes dramatically. Serving a larger number of clients with a given allocation translates to a lower per-client cost. For example, La Familia greatly exceeded its targets for providing information to low income residents (2,697 actual vs. 1,200 target, an increase of over 100%) and providing health care application assistance (723 actual vs. 133 target, an increase of over 500%). Safe Alternatives to Violence (SAVE), having set a target of providing 160 individual counseling sessions, actually provided 377\u2014an increase of over 100%. Fremont Aging and Family Services Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$35.1 million The recipients of the 25% of Measure A funds allocated by the Board obtained $26,347,012 in matching funds from public and private sources. 6conducted 563 home visits to 140 clients, compared to a target of 350 home visits to 85 clients. And the City of San Leandro Senior Community Center conducted 740 blood pressure/weight checks, compared to a target of 360\u2014an increase of almost 100%. Preventive Care In addition to providing emergency care and treatment, many Measure A providers used their funding to offer cost-effective preventive care. An analysis of health outcomes for children participating in the Alameda County Dental Health WIC \"Dental Days\" showed that they had 42% fewer restorative dental treatment needs compared to children who did not benefit from the program. Preventive Care Pathways clients experienced a reduction in emergency room visits to AHS and outside emergency rooms, as well as improvement in clinical findings related to diabetes, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. With the timely diagnostic care offered at Washington Hospital, abnormal findings were detected and treated earlier, which translated to better patient outcomes. Service Growth Many Measure A recipient providers experienced noticeable growth in service delivery in FY 14/15. For example, as a result of its Measure A-funded expansion efforts, Roots Community Health Center experienced an 87% increase in patient visits and a 300% increase in laboratory visits compared to the same time period pre-expansion. The Senior Support Program of Tri-Valley In-Home Counseling Program had more referrals in FY 14/15 than in any other year. Crisis Services Measure A goes beyond standard health care delivery to offer services to those in emergency or crisis situations. Through the Victims of Crime program, Measure A funding helped enable clients who would normally have been ignored because of lack of information of available resources, or limited resources to pay for treatment services, to receive necessary services on an ongoing basis at no cost to the client or to Alameda County. In a survey, Mercy Brown Bag Program recipients indicated that 37% didn't have enough money to buy food or other necessary items to last the entire month, 34% had to skip meals, and 76% thought their health would be negatively affected without this program. Thus, the program helped fill an important gap in maintaining the health and well-being of the older adult population.As a result of its Measure A-funded expansion efforts, Roots Community Health Center experienced an 87% increase in patient visits and a 300% increase in laboratory visits. 7Concerns In developing this report, the Oversight Committee identified several concerns regarding the state of health care funding both during the years of Measure A implementation (2004-2015) and in the foreseeable future. While Measure A tax revenues have gradually increased each year since their lowest levels in 2010, economic indicators reveal that the annual rate of change from the prior year started to decrease in 2012. Furthermore, many families living in disadvantaged communities have not benefited from the improved job and housing markets during the economic recovery over the past few years and continue to need access to the essential health care services that Measure A provides. The Committee urges Alameda County to continue to pay close attention to policy changes proposed by the 2016 presidential administration that may have significant impacts on health care access or the County's safety net. Moreover, Medi-Cal rate reductions and other funding cuts over the past several years have continued to decrease the ability of health providers to offer services to the expanded Medi-Cal and uninsured populations in the County. Realizing the full promise of these reforms presents a significant challenge as the health care delivery system remains fragmented, eligibility systems are cumbersome and difficult to negotiate, and access to care continues to be compromised by low reimbursement rates and a shortage of providers\u2014particularly in primary and preventive care. Measure A will continue to serve as an essential revenue stream in developing creative and innovative ways to improve access to care, lower the cost of care, and improve the patient experience. This in turn helps promote equity in health care service delivery by addressing the root causes of poor health outcomes. RECOMMENDATION: The Board should make a public announcement that Measure A funding is open to all organizations so that eligible organizations become aware of this funding opportunity and learn how to apply. Outside the area of health care funding, the Committee recognizes that the composition of the Committee has improved in reflecting the diverse make-up of the population served by Measure A. The Committee notes that this should be an area of ongoing focus as Committee member selections are made moving forward. Regarding Measure A funding, the Committee raises the following concerns. Note: The Committee believes it is important to present any concerns it noticed while reviewing Measure A recipient reports. At the same time, the 8Committee wants to make clear that raising a concern does not necessarily mean that a problem exists with a recipient's use of Measure A funds. For example, the concern may arise because of incomplete or inaccurate reporting, not because of any inappropriate use of funds. Reporting and Review Concerns As part of its role in providing fiscal oversight, the Committee recognizes a need for providers and HCSA to work together to evaluate the long-term impact of Measure A investments in Alameda County. The Oversight Committee believes that the interpretation of the statute must be revised to expand the role of the Committee and appropriately allocate Measure A funds for administrative staff to oversee the contracts and ensure the effective use of public funds to all grantees. The Committee expresses an ongoing concern that the County Counsel's interpretation of the Measure A ordinance limits the Committee's ability to review program efficacy and cost-effectiveness. In addition, the Committee does not have the capacity to review HCSA's process of controls and review of how the funding is spent\u2014via audit or other method. Although reporting continues to improve, the Committee expresses the ongoing concern that its review is impacted by the varying level of detail provided in fund recipient reports, as well as varying levels of responsiveness to specific questions posed by the Committee to specific recipients. This makes it difficult for the Committee to determine whether funding is being spent on the Measure A target population. For example:- Multiple provider reports listed objectives that are not measurable and/or stated positive outcomes without quantifying the statements. - For some reports, it is unclear whether the target population falls within one of the categories listed in the Measure A statute: \"indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. \" - In other reports, the provider's description of the services offered raises questions as to their relevance to the wording of the Measure A statute. RECOMMENDATION: HCSA should receive funding to create a process for Measure A recipients to verify that they are using Measure A funds to provide their described programs to the populations listed in the measure. This process can include HCSA staff providing training to Measure A recipients on how to effectively collect demographic data to report on the diverse populations of indigent, uninsured, and low income clients they serve by race, ethnicity, geography, and language. The Committee further advocates that HCSA be sufficiently staffed to successfully implement such a process. RECOMMENDATION: The Board should authorize HCSA to include evaluations of Measure A programs as part of its initiative to improve 9oversight and outcomes in all its programs. This includes identifying additional funding to ensure that Measure A contracts are included in the initiative. RECOMMENDATION: HCSA should hold trainings to reinforce proper and accurate completion of demographic information and adherence to Measure A services. RECOMMENDATION: HCSA should continue to work with recipients to improve the use of results-based performance measures and ensure that the population and services supported with Measure A comply with the ordinance. RECOMMENDATION: HCSA should update the recipient reporting form to include a question about service delivery in multiple languages, as language barriers can potentially impede access to services for members of the Measure A target population. RECOMMENDATION: 10% of Measure A recipients should undergo a formal audit each year to track whether money is being spent in accordance with the wording and intent of the measure. RECOMMENDATION: HCSA should put a process in place to improve the measurable objectives and outcomes reported by providers. Alameda Health System The Committee notes the following concerns: AHS provides well-stated goals, but objectives are not quantified. References are made to \"True North\" metrics without measurable objectives provided. AHS did not revise its report to include measurable objectives. Several results are described, however very few are quantified other than a generalization\u2014for example, \"improving patient transition from inpatient services to long-term care, rehabilitation, or the home. \" The Measure A funding expenditures reported by AHS exceeded the total Meaure A allocation of $99,321,959. The four reported categories of expenditures should add up to but not exceed this figure. AHS did not revise these figures. AHS reported that Measure A funds covered 3,484 FTEs, which seems excessive to reviewers. AHS did not respond to a request for clarification. Measure A accounts for 12.9% of the AHS budget. The number of individuals served by this funding should be less than the total number of individuals served by the agency. The provider report suggests that 94% of 156,330 individuals seen are uninsured and that 100% are qualified for entitlement benefit programs. This does not correspond with information provided in presentations from AHS executive staff. AHS should clarify and correct this information. 10Although AHS has made some progress, the Committee notes that these concerns have been raised for at least the last five years. RECOMMENDATION: A formal audit should be conducted to more accurately gain an understanding of expenditure of Measure A funds. Abode Services Greater HOPE Based on the provider report, it is unclear how the Measure A funds increased access to services for vulnerable populations. HOPE Crisis Outreach Program The Committee questions the use of Measure A funds to help people obtain survival gear for living on the streets: tents, sleeping bags, etc. The Committee wonders whether this money would be better used to fund housing or efforts to put clients into housing. Administration/Infrastructure Support The Direct Service Planning and Administration group does not have enough resources allocated to carry out a Measure A program evaluation that would adequately ensure accountability to Alameda County taxpayers for this annual expenditure of over $120 million. As a first step, appropriate levels of staffing and expenditures would allow staff to conduct mandatory audits and subsequent training for at least 10% of funding recipient programs. San Leandro Hospital The provider's report contains an impressive list of services and achievements. However, there is no alignment between these achievements and the clearly stated and quantifiable objectives in the provider report. In addition, the goals and objectives listed were not specific to San Leandro Hospital but instead were an exact reprint of the entire AHS goals and objectives. This causes difficulty in determining the intent and actual impact of Measure A funds. For example, the provider reports that all 24,627 individuals served were served by Measure A, but elsewhere reports that only 54% of individuals served qualified for Measure A benefits. The budget numbers reported are for the entire hospital budget and are not specific to the Measure A grant. The omitted information in the Measure A Funding Summary section has been requested several times without response. RECOMMENDATION: A full audit should be performed to determine accounting for Measure A expenditures. 11St. Rose Hospital The objectives included in the provider report are not quantifiably stated and should be revised. While the provider included excellent quantified results achieved in serving uninsured and underinsured patients, these should be revised to match the categories of patients described in the goals and objectives. UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital The Committee notes that CHO does not list measurable objectives, which has been raised repeatedly in the last several years. Additionally, many of the achievements do not give a specific time frame for achievement\u2014it is unclear what improvement, if any, took place from FY 13/14 to FY 14/15. All the numbers listed under the Measure A Funding Summary are identical to the numbers listed in the FY13/14 Measure A report. RECOMMENDATION: A full audit should be performed to determine accounting for Measure A expenditures. Collaboration Agencies Responding to Disasters (CARD) It is unclear if the Measure A allocation to CARD complies with the ordinance requirement that funds go to provide \"emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children, families and seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. \" The project was not completed, with no services deliverables report. The provider reports that only the \"planning phase\" was completed before the agency went out of business. Only $7,500 of the $25,000 was paid out to CARD, and these Measure A funds went to planning for services that were never provided. West Oakland Youth Center (WOYC) One staff assigned to the WOYC project resigned mid-year. The supervisor took on the project responsibilities but wasn't able to bill against Measure A funding. Therefore, the actual expenditure was $44,244 out of WOYC's $70,000 allocation. 12Alameda County Board of SupervisorsDISTRIBUTION OF MEASURE A FUNDSHOW THE MONEY WAS SPENT Alameda Health System Board of Trustees25% 75%Measure A tax revenue is used to provide emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children and families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. Each year, the Alameda Health System (AHS) receives 75% of Measure A funds, which is allocated by their Board of Trustees to provide primary and specialty care, preventative, and mental health services to patients served at AHS's multiple facilities, including Highland Hospital, John George Psychiatric Hospital, Fairmont Hospital, San Leandro Hospital, and Alameda Hospital. The remaining 25% of the Measure A funds received is allocated by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board) to provide critical medical services offered by community-based health care providers, emergency care, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to address the many health needs of communities throughout the County. In FY 14/15, Measure A generated $132,429,279 (not including interest earned). The funds were allocated as follows:Alameda Health System (75%): the Alameda County approved budget totaled $2.786 billion. The Alameda County Health Care Services Agency approved budget totaled $614.8 million, or 22.1% of the total County budget. Measure A revenues not specifically designated for AHS accounted for 5.4%. The following sections in the report provide more detail on how AHS and the Board spent Measure A funds in FY 14/15, which includes revenue generated in the reporting year as well as unspent funds earned in previous years. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 13BACk GROUND Alameda Health System (AHS) is a patient- and family-centered system of care that promotes wellness, eliminates disparities, and optimizes the health of its diverse communities. AHS program objectives are guided by a three-year strategic plan, which is built on the following pillars: Access goals relate to providing care to all County residents by expanding access to services. Key goals in FY 14/15 included the following: - Increasing coordination and referral of specialty care with the Community Health Clinic Network (CHCN) - Further integration of San Leandro and Alameda Hospitals into the system - Increasing Cardiology, Dermatology, Optometry, and Orthopedic service lines - Expanding the Complex Care Program for high risk, high cost, complex care patients - Increasing medical home assignments for emergency department (ED) and specialty clinic patients - Increasing the utilization rate of the 24-hour nurse advice line - Reducing the overall length of stay in the various EDs Quality Enhancement goals in FY 14/15 further aligned AHS with patient safety initiatives, such as benchmarks set by the Joint Commission, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Key goals in FY 14/15 included the following: - Continued focus on panel management, including increasing preventive health screenings at outpatient facilities - Incorporation of Alameda Health Partners, a physician organization dedicated to streamlining clinical priorities and coordinating and supporting physicians in delivering high quality, efficient, value-based care to patients and communitiesAllocation: $99,321,959 | Expended/Encumbered: $99,321,959 156,330 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Inpatient, Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental Health, Substance AbuseService area: Countywide, Outside of Alameda County, Homeless or transientFY 14/15: 75% OF MEASURE A FUNDS ALLOCATED TO Alameda Health System alamedahealthsystem.org Matching Funds AHS leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain $17,958,463 in matching funds through a number of different intergovernmental transfers provided by Alameda County, including the following: Medicaid Waiver Seniors and Persons with Disabilities Rate Range DSRIPMeasure A AllocationMatching Funds$99,321,959 $17,958,463 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 14- Continued focus on harm reduction, including reducing sepsis infection and pressure ulcers at inpatient facilities - Establishing a new care coordination infrastructure, multidisciplinary teams, and processes to improve patient flow, documentation, and avoidable readmissions Service Enhancement goals promote an improved patient experience. Key goals in FY 14/15 included the following: - Developing processes and implementing best practices designed to reduce the response time to patient call buttons - Increasing inclusion of patient preference in his or her treatment - Conducting patient experience surveys in cooperation with the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) - Sharing data, best practices, and findings with the Safety Net Institute (SNI) to foster shared learning and benchmarking across California's public hospitals - Improving patient transitions from inpatient services to long-term care, rehabilitation, or the home - Improving the \"fast track\" door to discharge process for lower acuity patients at John George Psychiatric Hospital (JGPH) and Highland Hospital, for better patient flow and utilization of provider resources Sustainability goals represent a commitment to financial stability, operational efficiency, and debt reduction. Under the Affordable Care Act, AHS seeks to offset declining federal funds with new patient revenues from expanded Medi-Cal, the Health Insurance Exchange, and new contracts with commercial payers. Key goals in FY 14/15 included the following: - Developing processes such as Budget Variance and FTE committees to maintain budget disciplineService Enhancement goals included improving patient transitions from inpatient services to long-term care, rehabilitation, or the home. REvENUE EARNED EACH FISCAL YEAR OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 15- Establishing a Revenue Cycle Improvement Project to develop standardized reporting - Implementing forecasting software to model service line projections through 2020 - Developing reconciliation processes and standards to correct material accounting errors and inaccuracies and ensure financial integrity - Improving charge capture, billing, and revenue cycle management processes across the organization - Implementing an ongoing cost management initiative aimed at reducing unnecessary costs and improving efficiency by decreasing usage of overtime labor and improving core staff scheduling, redesigning the supply chain, improving purchased service contract pricing, and implementing flex scheduling - Developing a managed care contracting department to expand access to commercially insured patients so patients who want to stay with AHS can do so without service interruption - Improving end-to-end revenue cycle functioning Workforce Development goals promote a culture of customer service, innovation, and achievement by attracting, developing, and retaining competent and compassionate staff. Key goals in FY 14/15 included the following: - Establishing Alameda Health Partners, a physician organization dedicated to coordinating and supporting physicians and streamlining clinical priorities - Increasing staff training in population health management - Evaluating and providing training in communication skills competencies and customer service for permanent inpatient nurses and staff members - Hiring additional physician and support staff to meet patient demand and expand service offerings - Working to increase employee engagement and commitment to organizational goals and patient experience MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Measure A is a supplemental revenue source for AHS, reducing the gap between reimbursement for services from a variety of sources and the actual cost of providing those services to underinsured and uninsured persons. Measure A supports all of AHS's services, with the exception of that fraction of AHS's business for which it receives full reimbursement for the cost of services provided. Measure A helped AHS achieve the following measurable objectives in FY 14/15: Access: Decrease length of stay for admitted patients to 6.9 hours (target: 7.8 hours) Sustainability: Attain a -8.0% operating margin in fiscal 2015, and 3.3% in budget 2016 (target: 3.0%)Measure A Helps In 2014, Mr. H. came to the Highland ED 18 times. Primarily homeless, he had cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, hepatitis B, kidney disease, and pain. The complex care management team twice discharged Mr. H. to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), which he left against medical advice. The team continued to see him when he was in the hospital. Over time he seemed more comfortable talking and building trust. However, after yet another discharge and return hospital stay, the team came up with the idea of hospice. In the hospice SNF, the team ran interference between Mr. H. and staff. Shortly after, Mr. H. asked for help contacting friends and relatives, and the team has been helping him fill out applications for independent housing. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 16 Quality: Experience a decline in preventable harm of 11% systemwide and 40% over the past five years Service: In hospital surveys, obtain approximately a 12% improvement in patient responses compared to the prior year Workforce Development: In surveys, obtain a 3.88 employee engagement score and a 3.68 physician engagement score (target score: 4) CONCERNS The Committee notes the following concerns: AHS provides well-stated goals, but objectives are not quantified. References are made to \"True North\" metrics without measurable objectives provided. AHS did not revise its report to include measurable objectives. Several results are described, however very few are quantified other than a generalization\u2014for example, \"improving patient transition from inpatient services to long-term care, rehabilitation, or the home. \" The Measure A funding expenditures reported by AHS exceeded the total Meaure A allocation of $99,321,959. The four reported categories of expenditures should add up to but not exceed this figure. AHS did not revise these figures. AHS reported that Measure A funds covered 3,484 FTEs, which seems excessive to reviewers. AHS did not respond to a request for clarification. Measure A accounts for 12.9% of the AHS budget. The number of individuals served by this funding should be less than the total number of individuals served by the agency. The provider report suggests that 94% of 156,330 individuals seen are uninsured and that 100% are qualified for entitlement benefit programs. This does not correspond with information provided in presentations from AHS executive staff. AHS should clarify and correct this information. Although AHS has made some progress, the Committee notes that these concerns have been raised for at least the last five years. RECOMMENDATION: A formal audit should be conducted to more accurately gain an understanding of expenditure of Measure A funds.Measure A helped AHS experience a decline in preventable harm of 11% systemwide and 40% over the past five years.ALLOCATION OF ALAMEDA HEALTH SYSTEM MEASURE A FUNDS IN FY 14/15 Highland Hospital Fairmont Campus Behavioral Health AmbulatoryAlameda Hospital San Leandro Hospital 18%16% 13%8% 34%11% CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 17FY 14/15: 25% OF MEASURE A FUNDS ALLOCATED BY The Alameda County Board of Supervisors In FY 14/15, the Board of Supervisors (Board) approved approximately $35.1 million in total Measure A allocations.

Abode Service received two Measure A allocations: one for its Greater HOPE program, and one for its HOPE Crisis Outreach Program. Greater HOPE Greater HOPE provides wraparound clinical services and housing to adults with severe mental illness, long histories of homelessness, and other barriers such as chronic health conditions. HOPE Crisis Outreach Program The HOPE program provides outreach and engagement services to homeless people in Livermore, mid County, and Fremont. The program assesses people's needs and helps connect them to resources including income, shelter, medical services, mental health and drug and alcohol services, employment, etc. The team also helps link people to basic resources like survival gear for living on the streets, IDs, Social Security cards, food, cell phones, transportation, etc. Through its street outreach, the HOPE program reaches those with the most barriers, which often include severe mental health challenges, drug and alcohol addiction, and/or chronic health conditions. The goal is to provide services and linkage to referrals and housing that will improve health and housing outcomes for these clients. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Greater HOPE Measure A funds were used to improve the delivery of services and documentation and billing of services. Through Measure A funding, the Allocation: $50,000/$90,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $50,000/$64,975 Individuals 50/612 ) Populations served: Indigent, Uninsured Adults Services provided: Mental Health, Substance AbuseService area: Castro Valley, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Newark, Oakland, Union City, Homeless or transientAbode Services www.abodeservices.org Measure A Helps HOPE Crisis Outreach Program The HOPE team encountered a 55-year-old homeless man with severe alcohol addiction and a physical disability. This man had almost daily interaction with police, fire, and paramedics due to drinking heavily, passing out, or falling out of his wheelchair. The HOPE team helped the client get an ID, Social Security card, and income, as well as complete his application for housing. The client moved into his own apartment after nine months. He has stopped drinking and smoking. He has established a primary care provider and stabilized his health needs. Since becoming housed, this client has not had a single encounter with law enforcement or emergency services. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 20team received IPS training, hired an employment specialist, and launched an employment program utilizing the IPS model. Five people are currently enrolled in the employment program. Specifically, Abode Services Greater HOPE used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following: Create and implement a Quality Assurance manual Train nine staff on Quality Assurance standards (target: 7) Review and update 65 clinical files to ensure accuracy (target: 50) Develop and implement a tool to track staff productivity Develop and implement performance improvement plans for clinicians with productivity of less than 45% Train 11 staff in Assertive Community Treatment Hire an Employment Specialist and develop a vocational program HOPE Crisis Outreach Program Measure A funds were used to fund the HOPE program's street outreach efforts in mid County. Specifically, the Abode Services HOPE Crisis Outreach Program used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following: Provide 100% of direct services in locations outside clinic offices (target: 75%) Link 83% of clients to a primary care provider (PCP) and have them make at least one visit to a PCP within six months of enrollment (target: 100%) House 58% of clients in temporary shelter or transitional housing at program exit (target: 50%) Help 42% of clients obtain permanent housing at program exit, with 2% of those obtaining permanent housing within six months (target: 25% of clients obtaining housing, with 50% obtaining housing within six months) Help 67% of clients exit the program to a known destination (target: 60%) Have 92% of clients who enter the program without health insurance coverage exit with health insurance coverage (target: 100%) Have 67% of clients experience an increase in monthly income from program intake to program exit (target: 25%) CONCERNS Greater HOPE Based on the provider report, it is unclear how the Measure A funds increased access to services for vulnerable populations. HOPE Crisis Outreach Program The Committee questions the use of Measure A funds to help people obtain survival gear for living on the streets: tents, sleeping bags, etc. The Committee wonders whether this money would be better used to fund housing or efforts to put clients into housing.Highlights Greater HOPE The program served 50 people during this period and maintained 85% housing stability. Everyone in the program was connected with mental health services and housing support services. 55% of clients without SSI benefits were connected to benefit advocacy services. Over 75% of clients decreased psychiatric hospital stays and/or criminal justice involvement. Matching Funds Abode Services Greater HOPE leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain matching funds from Medi-Cal Billing. The HOPE Crisis Outreach Program obtained matching funds from Medi-Cal Administrative Activities (MAA). 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 21BACk GROUND Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) works to maximize the recovery, resilience, and wellness of all eligible Alameda County residents who are developing or experience serious mental health, alcohol, or drug concerns. Community-based organizations (CBOs) provide mental health and substance use disorder services under contract with BHCS to meet the diverse cultural and language needs of County resident populations. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Measure A funds were used to support 26 mental health and substance use disorder programs. Funds were roughly evenly distributed between mental health and AOD programs. Providers used Measure A funds to support expansion in service operations and administrative needs, and to address cost increases not sufficiently covered by standard cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) provided by their contracts. The use of Measure A funds to mitigate budget cuts allowed providers to serve approximately the same number of County residents in AOD programs, despite unavoidable cost increases for insurance, utilities, and other non-service-related operational expenses. These additional funds contributed to significant client-level outcomes, such as service continuity, outreach effectiveness, and client engagement in treatment objectives that would be put at risk by cutbacks in provider service capacity.Allocation: $753,250 | Expended/Encumbered: $383,219 Individuals 35,393 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Mental Health, Substance AbuseService area: CountywideBehavioral Health and Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Community www.acbhcs.org Matching Funds BHCS-contracted CBOs leveraged their Measure A allocations to obtain $19,961 in matching funds from Medi- Cal and the Activities (MAA) program.Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$753,250 $19,961 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 22BACk GROUND The Center for Healthy Schools and Communities (CHSC) works to foster the academic success, health, and well-being of Alameda County youth by building universal access to high quality supports and opportunities in schools and neighborhoods. The Center focuses its programs on five specific result areas: Children are physically, socially, and emotionally healthy. Children succeed academically. Environments are safe, supportive, and stable. Families are supported and supportive. Systems are integrated and care is coordinated and equitable. Co-coordinated by CHSC and the Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) Agency, the Alameda County School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative strives to strengthen and expand school-based behavioral health practice, finance, evaluation, and policy in Alameda County. In partnership with school districts and service providers, the Initiative works to deliver a continuum of school-based behavioral health supports to students in schools throughout Alameda County. CHSC and BHCS used their Measure A allocation to enhance two core programs of the Alameda County School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative: the Our Kids Our Families Program, and the School District Consultation program. The Our Kids Our Families program, provided at 29 school sites in the Hayward and Oakland Unified School Districts, is a school-based behavioral health program that fosters social-emotional wellness in an educational environment so that children and families feel connected, safe, and supported in school. The Our Kids Our Families program supports prevention efforts at the school sites, as well as early intervention and treatment services for any student and their family that needs it.Allocation: $617,362 | Expended/Encumbered: $617,362 Individuals 3,840 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families Services provided: Mental Health, Substance AbuseService area: Ashland, Cherryland, Dublin, Emeryville, Hayward, Livermore, Newark, Oakland, Pleasanton, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Union City, Homeless or transientCenter for Healthy Schools and Communities (School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative) achealthyschools.org Measure A Helps An 8th grade student in New Haven Unified was having difficulty self-regulating his emotion and relating to his peers, and often sought attention through negative behaviors. He attended a support group created by the COST team to give students from Mexico and Central America the opportunity to address their thoughts and feelings regarding their transition to the United States. Throughout the group, students were allowed to address their issues of grief, loss, and trauma. As the group progressed, the student was able to build positive relationships with group members, increased his sense of empathy, and became very engaged in conversations regarding group topics. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 23 The School District Consultation program places behavioral health consultants (BHCs) in school districts to provide and enhance preventive social-emotional supports and mental health services for students and their families. The BHCs conducted the following activities: - Assessed the social-emotional service needs and infrastructure of a school district or set of schools and developed a service plan - Coordinated the work of all partner agencies who deliver behavioral health services in schools and districts - Provided and/or coordinated clinical case management, group, and individual counseling to students - Provided workshops, parenting groups, and mental health and other appropriate consultation to parents/caregivers; linked parents/ caregivers with needed resources in the school and community; and supported school and school district efforts to engage and support families in meaningful and positive ways - Provided crisis assessment and intervention for students, supported schools in effective crisis response, and supported school districts in developing crisis response protocols - Provided clinical supervision to interns and/or actively participated in intern recruitment and placement - Conducted planning to develop service referral and coordination systems - Provided behavioral health consultation to district/school staff to strengthen connections between students and adults - Conducted psycho-education for administrators, teachers, school staff, parents, students, and community partners - Participated in district- or school-wide efforts to create a positive climate, prevent conflicts and violence, and enhance the community setting for all members - Developed or coordinated leadership and other opportunities for children/youth that allow them to participate meaningfully in their school - Expanded partnerships with County, city, and/or community-based organizations to fill service gaps - Worked to become more integrated into the school district's operational systemsHighlights Parent surveys reported a high level of satisfaction. Parents saw improvements in their children's ability to handle school and daily life, resolve problems, and interact positively with peers and adults . Parents also reported having a support network to assist them in dealing with their child's behavioral problems. The majority of parents reported that the parent/family engagement events were useful and informative, addressed their needs, and increased their knowledge and parenting skills . In six of the eight school districts supported under this program, considerable progress was made toward strengthening and expanding COST in FY 14/15. Three of the districts now have COST at every site, and five districts have made considerable progress in their implementation and expansion efforts. This is a substantial increase since the 2009-2010 school year, where only one of the eight districts was making a systemwide effort at implementing COST. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 24MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY The School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following objectives through the District Behavioral Health Consultation program. Increase access to behavioral health supports for students and their families in eight school districts in Alameda County Measure A funding has been instrumental in continuing to expand to previously underserved school districts in the County, specifically the following: Emery Unified Newark Unified New Haven Unified Dublin Unified Livermore Valley Joint Unified Pleasanton Unified San Leandro Unified Hayward Unified Address the behavioral health support needs of students As measured by the Community Functioning Evaluation (CFE) administered to all students receiving early intervention and treatment services under the School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative, services delivered and/or coordinated by BHCs yielded positive results. At intake and discharge, school-based providers and BHCs assessed their clients on six common problem areas: Academic functioning Social relationships Exposure to violence/challenging environments Emotional and behavioral functioning Health/basic needs Living arrangements and basic functioning The Our Kids Our Families Intern Program supervised a total of 16 social work and MFT interns.

Additionally, students who received group or individual services presented statistically significant improvements in life functioning (43%), behavioral/emotional needs (24%), and school success (34%) from intake to discharge. In a survey conducted among middle and high school students who had received behavioral health services, 87% of respondents found those services to be extremely helpful in improving their ability to handle daily life, get along better with friends and family members, and succeed in school . 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 26BACk GROUND Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) works to maximize the recovery, resilience, and wellness of all eligible Alameda County residents who are developing or experience serious mental health, alcohol, or drug concerns. A program of BHCS, Criminal Justice (CJ) Screening/In-Custody Services provides a full range of mental health services to County jail inmates every month. Without jail mental health services, mentally ill inmates would go untreated. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY BHCS used its Measure A fund allocation to maintain staff at CJ Screening/In-Custody Services who provided assessment of all inmates and improved care by ensuring timely access to medications and reduced potential medication abuse at Santa Rita Jail. The demand for jail mental health services continues to remain steady, even though the number of overall inmates in the jail has decreased. To deliver mental health services effectively, mental health staff were assigned to various areas of the jail: intake (booking), inmate housing units, and the clinic. Staff worked in the intake section of the jail seven days a week, two shifts per day. Specific services supported by Measure A included the following.Mental Health Screening Initial (Intake). At the time of booking, all inmates are screened for medical and psychiatric treatment needs. Within 14 days, staff conduct an additional mental health appraisal. Inmates found to need a further mental health evaluation are referred to CJMH. The screening assessment includes an evaluation of the inmate's current psychiatric condition, psychiatric history, substance abuse (addictions) history and current use, psychiatric medication history and current need for medications, suicide history and current risk factors, and more. Post-booking. CJMH clinicians triage and screen all referred inmates for mental health service needs and recommend appropriate treatment plans based on the assessment. CJMH provides services onsite in Allocation: $4,306,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $4,306,000 Individuals served by (Total individuals served: 4,318) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Adults, Families, Seniors Services provided: Mental HealthService area: CountywideCriminal Justice Screening and In-Custody Services Highlights Prior to Measure A funding, there were too few mental health staff working in the jail to accommodate the high volume of inmates needing mental health assessments, services, and medications. Many had to wait a long time (two months) to be seen, if at all. CJMH now has mental health teams assigned to all the high risk housing units . They have also begun providing weekly groups for inmates in the special population male housing unit and at Glen Dyer Detention Facility (GDDF) in Oakland. They have expanded services at GDDF. Previously, inmates who wanted mental health services had to be transported to Santa Rita Jail in Dublin and would often wait in holding cells for most of the day. Now those needing mental health services are seen by CJMH clinical staff on site at GDDF weekly. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 27special housing units 1, 2, 8, 9, and 24. These onsite services allow CJMH staff to proactively deliver mental health services to mentally ill inmates who might otherwise fall through the cracks. Crisis Intervention Onsite. CJMH clinicians respond to urgent calls regarding seriously distressed inmates and provide crisis counseling, make recommendations for interventions, initiate interim placements, and/or make arrangements for psychiatric hospitalization. On-call. When there are no mental health staff onsite, a CJMH clinician is on call and can be reached by pager to assist with urgent mental health matters. Management of Inmate Behavioral ProblemsCJMH clinicians collaborate with and provide consultation to deputies and staff to develop and implement plans for appropriate management of inmate behavioral problems. Suicide Prevention CJMH participates with sheriff's personnel and medical staff in training, oversight, and procedures designed to prevent inmate suicides. At the time of booking, all inmates are assessed for suicide risk. In addition, CJMH conducts a suicide risk assessment on all inmates called to their attention as a result of inmates expressing suicidal thoughts or demonstrating self-injurious behaviors. CJMH staff work with inmates who demonstrate a risk for suicide and address risk factors, develop relapse prevention strategies, and discuss coping strategies. CJMH takes preventive action on all inmates expressing suicidal thoughts and/or demonstrating self-injurious behaviors. Ongoing Treatment Services, Treatment Planning, Stabilization of Mental Disorders, and Other ServicesAll inmates receiving mental health services are seen by CJMH clinicians, who develop individualized treatment plans to help inmates achieve mental stability, develop an awareness of their psychological and behavioral problems, and acquire coping skills while incarcerated. Medication support services. When appropriate, CJMH psychiatrists evaluate inmates and prescribe psychotropic medications to alleviate symptoms and allow the inmates to achieve an optimal level of functioning while incarcerated. Counseling services. Inmates referred for counseling services receive an additional post-booking assessment and are provided ongoing counseling sessions as determined by their treatment plan. Misdemeanant incompetents. With regard to misdemeanant Incompetent to Stand Trial (PC 1370.01) inmates, CJMH staff collaborate with the courts to provide treatment geared to restoring competence and/or refer inmates to community programs that can address competency.Measure A Helps A 19-year-old African American youth ended up in jail due to an incident in which his behavior escalated and his parents were fearful someone would be hurt. In jail, the youth was housed in administrative segregation due to his violence when psychotic and off his medications. The CJMH clinician was able to support both the youth and his family while he was in custody. This collaboration went on for the year while the youth was in custody. The clinician was able to help the youth regarding the loss around his college scholarship, being diagnosed with a serious mental illness, his adjustment to jail, and hope for the future. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 28 Court-ordered evaluations. CJMH clinicians conduct court-ordered psychiatric evaluations (PC 4011.6s) to assess the need for acute inpatient psychiatric care and provide reports back to the courts. Inpatient services. CJMH staff or deputies send inmates requiring acute inpatient hospitalization to acute psychiatric inpatient hospitals. When inmates are returned to the jail, they are held in the Outpatient Housing Unit (Infirmary) until CJMH clinicians can assess them, continue their medications, and clear them for housing. Inmates who refuse treatment. All treatment is voluntary. CJMH staff monitor inmates with serious mental illnesses who refuse treatment and make an ongoing attempt to engage these inmates in treatment. Outreach and teamwork. CJMH clinicians and psychiatrists closely monitor inmates in Special Housing Units: Ad Seg, Mental, Women's. Visits occur weekly, including cell checks for inmates who refuse to be seen or who are noncompliant with treatment. Substance abuse treatment. Inmates have access to programs that specifically address addiction problems. CJMH clinicians also address substance abuse as part of their ongoing interventions with inmates. Mental Health On-Call/Emergency ServicesEmergency mental health services are available 24 hours a day by onsite staff or by mental health professionals who work on call. Access to 24-hour acute psychiatric hospitalization is available. A CJMH psychiatrist is on call to accommodate the continuity of psychotropic medications. Discharge Planning/Continuity of Care When CJMH staff have advance notice of an inmate's date of release, staff make a referral for follow-up outpatient treatment. CJMH staff work closely with court mental health advocates the Court Advocacy Project (CAP), the Forensic Assertive Community Treatment (FACT) team, the Behavioral Health Court (BHC), and community service providers in coordinating treatment plans and release plans for persons in custody with serious mental illnesses. Training The CJMH Director, the Senior Clinician(s), and other mental health professionals provide training to sheriff's personnel and civilian staffs in mental illnesses and suicide prevention. All new CJMH staff receive 40 hours of initial training. CJMH managers and psychiatrists provide ongoing training to CJMH line staff on topics related to the practice of jail psychiatric services. The CJMH Lead Psychiatrist attends the monthly BHCS Psychiatric Practices Committee and shares information learned with other CJMH psychiatrists. Administration of Psychotropic Medications to Patients in a Psychiatric EmergencyPsychiatrists can legally prescribe psychotropic medication for emergency situations. Emergency mental health services are available 24 hours a day by onsite staff or by mental health professionals who work on call. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 29BACk GROUND The Detox/Sobering Center works to improve the quality of life for individuals, families, and the community affected by drug abuse and mental health issues by providing compassionate, effective prevention, treatment, and recovery services. The Detox Center is a social model nonmedical detoxification center specifically designed for individuals requiring 24-hour/7-day-a-week monitoring. It offers van transport for individuals needing transportation to and from medical, psychiatric, treatment, housing, or any other ancillary service. The Sobering Center is designed to assist those needing immediate sobering services from alcohol/drugs. It provides a brief visit of 23 hours or less with continual monitoring for safe withdrawal, 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Within the Sobering Center, the Health Center is staffed with nurse coordinators and health technicians who monitor withdrawal and assist with medical triage/assessment to ensure safe and healthy withdrawal.

La Familia used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following: Provide individual and family basic needs information and referral in the areas of housing, job referrals, nutrition, translations, health referrals, immigration, legal and general orientation, and health education workshops to low income residents, to help them attain increased psychosocial and economic stability (target: 1,200 residents; actual: 2,697) Provide case management support\u2014including intake and assessment, service planning, direct support, and evaluation\u2014for an average of 90 days to families facing multiple challenges (target: 159 families; actual: 79) Provide assistance in applying for health coverage through Medi-Cal and other available options to low income Hayward residents (target: 133 residents; actual: 723) Provide workshops/support groups for adults/caregivers on topics to improve access to medical and mental health resources, nutrition, parenting, coping skills, academic engagement, and advocacy (target: 105 workshops/support groups; actual 105) Provide workshops/support groups to youths to foster healthier relationships, discuss maladaptive behaviors and risk factors, and explore personal and social responsibility (target: 40 workshops/support groups; actual: 2,697 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Mental Health, Substance AbuseService area: Ashland, Cherryland, Hayward, San Leandro, San Lorenzo La Familia Counseling Services lafamiliacounseling.org Highlights La Familia met or exceeded its targets for almost all of its program objectives. In two areas, it greatly exceeded its targets: providing information to low income residents (2,697 actual vs. 1,200 target, an increase of over 100%), and providing health care application assistance (723 actual vs. 133 target, an increase of over 500%). 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 31BACk GROUND Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) offers mental health services to youth at the Alameda County Juvenile Hall in an effort to maximize the recovery, resilience, and wellness of those who develop or experience serious mental health, alcohol, or drug concerns. The services provided consist of individual therapy, case management, court-ordered evaluations, crisis intervention, and consultation to Juvenile Hall staff, probation officers, school staff, and the Juvenile Court. Youth who are detained in Juvenile Hall by nature of being in a locked facility away from family and friends experience anxiety, agitation, and depression in regards to their situation. This is in addition to any pre-existing mental health conditions that the youth struggle with prior to being admitted into Juvenile Hall. The goal of BHCS is to mitigate as much as possible the negative emotional impact of detention. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY BHCS used its Measure A allocation to provide mental health services to youth detained in the Juvenile Hall facility. The funding helped BHCS attain the following objectives: Mitigate the mental health issues of detained youth by offering crisis intervention and ongoing mental health support while detained. Provide court-ordered mental health assessments. Guidance Clinic staff completed approximately 244 mental health assessments in FY 14/15. Measure A funding covered approximately 33 of those assessments. Offer immediate crisis intervention for suicidal youth to avoid self- harm. The Guidance Clinic performed 156 crisis interventions to avoid self-harm and/or hospitalization, of which Measure A funded 21.

M.E.T. takes the pressure off officers having to make complex mental health decisions as the clinical mental health staff are able to assist with their expertise, knowledge of the system, and access to the mental health history of patients. M.E.T. has the ability to respond faster to 5150 MH crisis calls because the information is available on the patrol car's computer and the M.E.T. officers can proactively dispatch themselves to the call. M.E.T. provides options to de-escalate most situations by allowing the individual to make the choice to speak with either a clinician or an officer.BACk GROUND Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) works to maximize the recovery, resilience, and wellness of all eligible Alameda County residents who are developing or experience serious mental health, alcohol, or drug concerns. The Oakland Police Department Mobile Evaluation Team (M.E.T.) provides mobile assessment and evaluation services to those in crisis living in East Oakland. East Oakland was identified by the Oakland Police Department as having the second-largest percent of crisis calls after the downtown area, where BHCS already has a mobile crisis team. M.E.T. strives to avoid the use of involuntary psychiatric hospitalization when appropriate by providing alternative treatment resources, which may include consultation, crisis intervention, and referral to brief treatment and/or diversion to other voluntary crisis services as available. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY M.E.T. used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following objectives: Respond to six crisis calls per day, which increased to eight calls per day as the program became established. The Oakland Police Department responds to 20-25 mental health-related calls a day on average, so M.E.T. picked up, on average, one-quarter to one-third of the calls. Reduce the amount of time a cover officer has to be on the scene of the 5150 crisis call after the M.E.T. arrives. The cover unit was needed on scene for an average of 15 minutes, with a maximum of 30 minutes and a minimum of five minutes for some calls. Provide alternative resources to individuals in crisis. The result of the call was recorded on 320 of the 410 calls that M.E.T. responded to. Of the 320 calls, 58% of individuals were not put on an involuntary hold (5150) and were instead given resource materials, de-escalated, had a physical health/medical issue addressed, or refused to accept services. None of the calls that M.E.T. responded to resulted in an arrest.Allocation: $250,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $250,000 Individuals served by Measure A: 410 (Total individuals served: 410) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Mental Health, Substance AbuseService area: Oakland, Homeless or transientOakland Police Department www.acbchs.com 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 34BACk GROUND Options Recovery Services works to break the cycle of addiction that causes crime, homelessness, and broken families.

All SAVE services are provided free of charge. At SAVE, the only criteria for participation in counseling services is that the client has experienced or is experiencing domestic violence. The drop-in domestic violence support groups held at SAVE's community office are open to any woman struggling with the effects of domestic violence in her life. Any woman can come to group whenever she needs it. There is no registration process, and there are no limitations on how often she can come. Support groups provide a safe place for women to talk about their issues with each other and the support of a trained facilitator. The information and sense of community they receive from the group helps to reduce isolation and see that the blame lies with the abuser. Counseling staff are all trained in domestic violence and have expertise in the effects of that particular kind of trauma. They also understand the types of additional challenges clients who are low income or disabled or struggling with substance abuse or mental health issues might face. They work to ensure that they provide a trauma-informed, culturally appropriate, safe environment in which no client will ever feel judged or blamed for her choices. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Measure A support is a key source of funds for SAVE counseling services. SAVE used its Measure A allocation to meet the following objectives: Provide individual counseling sessions to participants, with at least 50% of clients participating in more than one session (target: 160 sessions to 45 participants; actual: 377 sessions to 59 participants, with 92% participating in more than one session) Develop safety plans in collaboration with clinicians and clients, with Allocation: $30,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $30,000 Individuals served by Measure (Total individuals served: 112 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families Services provided: Mental HealthService area: FremontSafe Alternatives to Violent Environments (SA VE) save-dv.org Highlights All SAVE programs supported by Measure A exceeded their targets, sometimes dramatically.

The client did not feel safe in her environment and had few financial resources. She had been expelled from her family and had no supportive relationships. The therapist assisted the client with food and hygiene needs and with calling shelters. The next morning, the client moved into the SAVE domestic violence shelter, where she continued to receive therapeutic support.

She moved to Washington state and has become an active member of the transgender community. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 37BACk GROUND Senior Support Program of Tri-Valley provides seniors services and assistance to foster independence, promote safety and well-being, preserve dignity, and improve quality of life. The In-Home Counseling Program makes a difference in the lives of Tri-Valley seniors by providing counseling services in seniors' homes. Staff members receive referrals from case managers, family members, caregivers, and other concerned members of the community. Counseling occurs on an individual basis. During sessions, counselors conduct assessments, including psychosocial, physical, mental health status, and personal history. Counselors also provide crisis intervention, resources, and referrals, as needed. By making this service free of charge, many older adults get the benefit of much-needed support with their most challenging end-of-life issues. In many cases, the counselor is the only contact the client has. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Senior Support Program of Tri-Valley depends on Measure A funding to support its In-Home Counseling program.

In sessions at the In-Home Counseling Program, the counselor assessed that Mr. J. needed more interactions with family, friends, and community, and discussed ways he could reach out more. Mr. J. received resources for managing his depression, finding a primary care doctor, and locating activities in the community. With each session, Mr. J opened up more about himself and what he wanted to create in his life. Mr. J. has become more outgoing and has started to reach out to others in the community.

The Schreiber Center, staffed by a full-time clinician and part-time psychiatrist, is now open, located in the Gail Steele Wellness Center in Hayward. A referral process was developed in collaboration with the Regional Center of the East Bay, and extensive outreach and training is ongoing. Services include assessment for specialty mental health, case consultation, psychotherapy, and medication support. Since the Schreiber Center's opening, the program has received over 50 referrals.

TVH strives to build a world without violence. The majority of clients at TVH have experienced domestic violence, sexual abuse, molestation, or assault at some time in their lives. TVH professional counseling staff provide intake and assessment and ongoing counseling services. Counseling involves validating client experiences, providing education on domestic violence and sexual abuse, helping clients realize they are not alone, and providing support in many clinical ways. Clients leave with a desire to take care of themselves, many for the first time in their adult lives, and with a positive feeling about their future. All of these factors help clients live fuller lives and have a positive sense of self and community rather than living in a state of shame and fear where they feel alone, hopeless, and worthless.

Of the 33 contracts that were developed by Administration and Indigent Health staff, 90.9% were fully executed within 2.5 months (which is the average turnaround time to develop a contract, receive Board approval, and encumber funds). Administration and Indigent Health staff provided one Results-Based Accountability (RBA) training in April 2015 to organizations that received Measure A base funding. A total of 10 organizations were trained in RBA, with 25 participants attending. Administration and Indigent Health staff monitored 33 Measure A contracts. The Measure A contract providers had contracts with either monthly or quarterly reimbursement schedules. Of the 156 invoices processed, 90.9% were processed within 30 days of receiving the invoice and progress report. Administration and Indigent Health staffed and convened 10 Measure A Oversight Committee meetings. Of the 10 meetings that were scheduled, 100% were convened. Administration and Indigent Health staff completed the production and distribution of the FY 13/14 Measure A Final Report. CONCERNS The Direct Service Planning and Administration group does not have enough resources allocated to carry out a Measure A program evaluation that would adequately ensure accountability to Alameda County taxpayers for this annual expenditure of over $120 million. As a first step, appropriate levels of staffing and expenditures would allow staff to conduct mandatory audits and subsequent training for at least 10% of funding recipient programs.Of the 33 contracts that were developed by Administration and Indigent Health staff, 90.9% were fully executed within 2.5 months . 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 43BACk GROUND San Leandro Hospital is a 93-bed community-based hospital that was acquired by Alameda Health System (AHS) in 2013. It provides inpatient and outpatient services including medical, surgical, and intensive care, as well as 24-hour emergency services in its 13-bed, Level II Emergency Department (ED). The hospital serves central Alameda County, a community of 265,000 people. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY This provider did not supply any Measure A funding summary information for FY 14/15. CONCERNS The provider's report contains an impressive list of services and achievements. However, there is no alignment between these achievements and the clearly stated and quantifiable objectives in the provider report. In addition, the goals and objectives listed were not specific to San Leandro Hospital but instead were an exact reprint of the entire AHS goals and objectives. This causes difficulty in determining the intent and actual impact of Measure A funds. For example, the provider reports that all 24,627 individuals served were served by Measure A, but elsewhere reports that only 54% of individuals served qualified for Measure A benefits. The budget numbers reported are for the entire hospital budget and are not specific to the Measure A grant. The omitted information in the Measure A Funding Summary section above has been requested several times without response. Because of these concerns, the Committee recommends a full audit to determine accounting for Measure A expenditures.Allocation: $1,000,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $1,000,000 Individuals 24,627 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Inpatient, Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental HealthService area: Countywide, Outside of Alameda County, Homeless or transientSan Leandro Hospital sanleandroahs.org 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 44BACk GROUND St. Rose Hospital (SRH) is a safety-net, independent, nonprofit hospital that provides critical access to emergency medical, hospital inpatient, and outpatient services for indigent, low income, underinsured populations in central and southern Alameda County. These services include the following: Critical access. SRH serves as a critical access point for Alameda County and is the only Medi-Cal-contracted facility between Oakland and Fremont. Additionally, SRH serves as a safety-net hospital and provides health care access to many low income residents who do not have adequate transportation to the Alameda County Medical Center. Hospitalists programs. The Hospitalists assume care of indigent and uninsured patients who are admitted to SRH. This alleviates the financial impact of private physicians who request compensation for lack of reimbursement. Women's services. SRH operates the Women's Center to meet the growing demand for OB/GYN services in the community, because many OB practitioners do not accept Medi-Cal rates. The program provides immediate and emergency care for pregnant women who present to the emergency room (ER), often with no history of prenatal care. Cardiac care. SRH is the only Medi-Cal-contracted facility to provide elective cardiac and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) services in central Alameda County. There has been a 3% increase in procedures for Medi-Cal beneficiaries in fiscal year 2015 over 2014. SRH routinely accepts hospital transfers for emergency and elective cardiac care from non-Medi-Cal providers. SRH serves approximately 12% of Alameda County's indigent population. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY SRH used its Measure A funds to subsidize the cost of providing care to the following groups of patients: Patients who qualify for charity care Uninsured and/or indigent patientsAllocation: $4,000,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $4,000,000 40,805 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Inpatient, Hospital OutpatientService area: Countywide, Homeless or transientSt. Rose Hospital strosehospital.org Measure A Helps A 61-year-old homeless male was brought into the emergency department due to loss of consciousness with acute gastrointestinal bleeding.

An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed gastritis, duodenitis, and an duodenal ulcer. A blood transfusion was given. The patient was stabilized and discharged six days later. Since the patient did not qualify for insurance, the hospital made the decision to waive the hospital bill. The patient has often returned to St. Rose Hospital to thank the staff for their kindness. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 45 Traditional Medi-Cal beneficiaries Medi-Cal Managed Care enrollees, including Alameda Alliance members HealthPAC members SRH used its Measure A allocation to help achieve the following: Provide emergency care for uninsured and underinsured patients.

Provide hospital admissions for 3,381 uninsured or underinsured patients, representing 57% of total inpatient admissions. Assist in supporting SRH inpatient services to uninsured and underinsured patients. Hospital-based physicians provided over 11,500 patient encounters for uninsured patients for the year. CONCERNS The objectives included in the provider report are not quantifiably stated and should be revised. While the provider included excellent quantified results achieved in serving uninsured and underinsured patients, these should be revised to match the categories of patients described in the goals and objectives.Matching Funds SRH leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain $2,000,000 in matching funds from the intergovernmental transfer program through the Medi-Cal program.Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$4,000,000 $2,000,000 2014-2015 MEASURE COMMITTEE REPORT 46BACk GROUND UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland (CHO) works to protect and advance the health and well-being of children through clinical care, teaching, and research. At CHO, Measure A funding supported three programs/activities: The pediatric Emergency Department (ED), specifically to provide adequate staffing for the large volume of children seen at the ED The Center for Child Protection (CCP) School-based clinics Emergency Department CHO provides highly specialized pediatric emergency services for the children of Alameda County, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. CHO's ED sees a broad array of pediatric disease and injury from the basic to the most complex. CHO is the leading provider for Alameda County children in need of acute care. Children with Medi-Cal rely nearly exclusively on CHO for emergency services since the public hospitals in the area do not provide specialized pediatric care and do not have any beds for children in the event a child needs to stay overnight. In FY 14/15, CHO's ED was the highest volume ED in the San Francisco Bay Area. CHO's ED is one of two designated Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Centers in Northern California and the only one in the Bay Area. Children's Trauma Center has 24-hour in-house staff including pediatric specialists in emergency medicine, trauma surgery, anesthesiology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, diagnostic imaging, and critical care. For many children, the ED also functions as the gateway to a regular medical home, specialty care, or other community programs sponsored by CHO or other organizations.

She was hesitant to pursue this opportunity, as she had significant family pressure to stay in Oakland. However, with encouragement from her therapist she was able to leave. Over her breaks from college she often came to the clinic for ongoing care and would discuss the \"culture shock\" of living in Idaho coming from East Oakland. With continued support and encouragement she completed college, has completed her Masters of Science in Criminal Justice, and is living in Louisiana. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 47California. Without the CHO ED, children would need to travel farther and/or receive care that is not specialized to children. With little doubt, more children would die without the CHO ED. Center for Child Protection CHO and Alameda County recognize that they share a responsibility to provide immediate and comprehensive care for this population of children, yet there are many challenges to maintaining this responsibility. CCP serves more than 1,000 clients per year. CCP is a comprehensive child abuse program within CHO. CCP is the only provider in Alameda County that has the capacity to offer many of its services. Because many CCP services are funded by external sources such as Measure A, there is no charge for eligible clients. This feature is very important because if CCP needed to charge insurance for these services, there would be a record of services provided, and many families would not step forward to divulge such sensitive information. CCP maintains staffing 24 hours per day to respond to acute forensic examinations for children under 14 years old when the alleged sexual abuse occurred within 72 hours. Non-acute forensic examinations for children under age 18 and second opinion medical consults are performed in the CCP outpatient clinic through appointment only. Clinical case management is provided to children and adolescents who present to the ED and/or child abuse management clinic following diagnosis or disclosure of abuse. Comprehensive evidenced-based mental health services are provided to children, adolescents, and their families who have been exposed to childhood trauma, including child abuse and/ or witness to violence. For most of these families, there are no alternatives in Alameda County for many of the services provided by CCP . School-Based Clinics CHO runs two school-based health centers: one at Castlemont High School and one at McClymonds High School. The school health centers provide a safe and convenient place for students to receive integrated, comprehensive medical and mental health services. The Youth Uprising/ Castlemont Health Clinic sees students from Castlemont High School as well as members of the community ages 11-24. The Chappell Hayes Health Clinic sees students from McClymonds High School as well as members of the community ages 11-21. The Castlemont site is now the highest volume school-connected mental health site in Alameda County. The sites' School-Based Mental Health Program has become a national model for the integration of medical and mental health care, and it has been cited for success at addressing underlying social stressors related to mental health. The program has Matching Funds CHO leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain $3,000,000 in matching funds through an intergovernmental transfer using supplemental funds from the California Department of Health Care Services.Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$1,000,000$3,000,000 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 48developed a training and consultation program for school professionals and mental health providers who work with schools, and it has contracts to conduct trainings throughout Alameda County and California. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY CHO used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following: Emergency Department In FY 14/15, there were a total of 44,508 unique patients to the ED. 665 of these visits were trauma cases where the child faced an immediate life-threatening situation. The total average time children spent at the ED shrunk to 3.1 hours. This compares with 4.1 hours for CHO's peer group according to studies conducted by McKesson. Measure A funding helped the ED upgrade its space to be more kid-friendly and purchase state-of-the-art equipment, such as new monitors and imaging equipment. The average time for providing sickle cell patients with proper pain medication decreased from 90 minutes to 30 minutes, which is among the top in the nation. Over 400 children seen in the ED were referred to and seen at CHO's asthma clinic for follow-up care and asthma education. Center for Child Protection In FY 14/15, the CCP served more than 1,000 children. The CCP conducted 104 forensic evidentiary examinations, 55 outpatient medical consultations, and 57 inpatient medical consultations, and provided clinical and psychotherapy services to 556 children. School-Based Clinics In FY 14/15, the two clinics run by CHO had a total of 2,458 encounters and saw 823 children/adolescents. CONCERNS The Committee notes that CHO does not list measurable objectives, which has been raised repeatedly in the last several years. Additionally, many of the achievements do not give a specific time frame for achievement\u2014it is unclear what improvement, if any, took place from FY 13/14 to FY 14/15. All the numbers listed under the Measure A Funding Summary are identical to the numbers listed in the FY13/14 Measure A report. Because of these concerns, the Committee recommends a full audit.The average time for providing sickle cell patients with proper pain medication decreased from 90 minutes to 30 minutes , which is among the top in the nation. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 49FUNDS ALLOCATED BY THE ALAMEDA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS GROUP 3: PRIMARY CARE Alameda County Dental Health ................................................................................................................ 51 Berkeley Community Health Project (Berkeley Free Clinic) ...................................................................... 53 Center for Elders' Independence ............................................................................................................. 55 Center for Healthy Schools and Communities (School Health Centers) ...................................................... 56 Fire Station Health Portals ........................................................................................................................ 60 Fremont Aging and Family Services .......................................................................................................... 62 Health Enrollment for Children ................................................................................................................ 65 Health Services for Day Laborers: Community Initiatives (Day Labor Center) .......................................... 66 Health Services for Day Laborers: Multicultural Institute ......................................................................... 68 Health Services for Day Laborers: Street Level Health Project ................................................................. 70 Hope Hospice ........................................................................................................................................... 72 Increase Hospice Utilization ..................................................................................................................... 73 Medical Costs for Juvenile Justice Center: Direct Service Planning and Administration .......................... 74 Medical Costs for Juvenile Justice Center: Mind Body Awareness ........................................................... 75 Medical Costs for Juvenile Justice Center: Niroga Institute ...................................................................... 76 Medical Costs for Juvenile Justice Center: Victims of Crime .................................................................... 77 Preventive Care Pathways ........................................................................................................................ 78 Primary Care Community-Based Organizations ........................................................................................ 79 Roots Community Health Center .............................................................................................................. 81 Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center, Inc. ........................................................................................................ 82 Washington Hospital ................................................................................................................................ 84 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 50BACk GROUND The Alameda County Public Health Department works in partnership with the community to ensure the optimal health and well-being of all people through a dynamic and responsive process that respects the diversity of the community and works to provide for present and future generations. A program of the Public Health Department, the WIC Oral Health Collaborative provides an accessible early entry point for oral health assessment and preventive dental services for high risk families and children ages 0-5 years at WIC, as well as continuity and referral for regular follow-up dental care in the community. The services provided at WIC include dental history interviews to identify risk factors and oral home care practices, brushing the child's teeth and applying fluoride, assessing the child's mouth, and setting goals for home care behaviors. For children who need follow-up care beyond the services provided at the WIC site, the outreach worker collaborates with the family to assess insurance coverage, obtain a dental appointment with a provider, and assist with making the initial dental appointment. For families lacking insurance coverage, the outreach worker arranges insurance assistance through the Healthy Smiles Dental Treatment program. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Measure A funding helped the WIC Oral Health Collaborative program achieve the following measurable results: Enroll at least 400 infants and toddlers into the Healthy Kids Healthy Teeth (HKHT) program of preventive dental services and access to early dental care Provide 710 of these children with oral assessments and fluoride varnish applicationsAllocation: $153,662 | Expended/Encumbered: 4,833 ) Populations served: Indigent, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families Services provided: Public HealthService area: Alameda, Castro Valley, Fremont, Hayward, Newark, Oakland, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Union CityNote: In addition to its individual allocation, Alameda County Dental Health also received Measure A money through the Public Health Prevention Initiative allocation (see page 107).

The family was hesitant to accept public health services while they were experiencing financial hardship and language barriers. The outreach worker referred the family to the Healthy Smiles program and ensured them that translation services would be available. The child had his dental appointment and was scheduled for follow-up treatment. The outreach worker kept in close contact with the family and was able to enroll other siblings into the Healthy Smiles program. The child is no longer suffering from dental pain and infection, and has a dental home that provides preventive and restorative dental services. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 52Allocation: $50,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $50,000 Individuals 8,207 ) Populations served: Indigent, provided: Public Health, Mental HealthService area: Countywide, Homeless or transient BACk GROUND The Berkeley Free Clinic (BFC) works to empower individuals and communities by providing accessible, client-centered health services and information. All services at BFC are provided completely free of charge. BFC also provides extensive education and referrals to every client. Every client is screened for health insurance needs and, when applicable, referred to BFC's Certified Enrollment Counselors for help exploring options for health insurance. Providers also work with clients to determine what social services, like food, housing, and long-term primary care, might be beneficial to the client. BFC's Information Resource Collective provides in-person and over-the-phone referrals for requests ranging from legal counsel to crisis hotlines to transportation resources and more. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Every year, the BFC provides thousands of same-day appointments for acute medical care, STI screens, TB tests, dental care, and peer counseling. Measure A funding enabled BFC to provide fully comprehensive care to individuals requiring more significant help than what BFC is typically able to afford. Specifically, BFC used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following: Provide acute medical care for certain respiratory infections, dermatological concerns, urinary tract infections, and minor wounds/burns to 101 clients. - 94% of clients indicated that they were satisfied or highly satisfied with the services they received. - 64% indicated they knew more about how to treat or prevent their health concern after the visit than they did before. - 35% reported that if they had not come to BFC, they would have needed to rely on the emergency room to address their concerns.Berkeley Community Health Project (Berkeley Free Clinic) berkeleyfreeclinic.org Measure A Helps After her boyfriend cheated on her, ZD came to BFC for an STD screen. She received information about symptoms, treatment, and how long it would take before an STD showed up on a test. The BFC counselor who called ZD with the test results took extra time to talk with ZD about how she was doing emotionally. ZD was uninsured, so the counselor also talked with her about health insurance. A BFC Certified Enrollment Counselor helped ZD navigate the Covered CA system and sign up for health insurance. She has a primary care doctor now and feels much more secure and in control of her health. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 53 Provide confidential STI/HIV testing and counseling to 150 clients and provide referrals to other organizations for STI and HIV management as needed. - 100% of clients with a reactive result on a rapid HIV test received a confirmatory test the same day and a confirmed result within two weeks. - 68% indicated that they knew more about their sexual health after the visit than they did before. - 100% presenting GC or NSU received treatment the night of their visit.

The Center focuses its programs on five specific result areas: Children are physically, socially, and emotionally healthy. Children succeed academically. Environments are safe, supportive, and stable. Families are supported and supportive. Systems are integrated and care is coordinated and equitable. A program of CHCS, School Health Centers (SHCs) play a vital role in creating universal access to health services by providing a continuum of age-appropriate and integrated health and wellness services for youth in a safe, youth-friendly environment at or near schools. SHCs provide services in the following areas. Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services The SHCs offer school-based counseling on alcohol and drugs including individual counseling, prevention and early intervention, substance abuse assessments, and relapse prevention. Behavioral health group counseling is offered at the SHCs for prevention and early intervention, including some groups that focus on conflict resolution and/or restorative justice. The SHCs also offer crisis intervention, family therapy, and referrals as needed. Other services included case management, individual contact/meetings, plan development, and collateral with family members and school staff.

She told the therapist that she had had an upsetting sexual experience the day before. While undergoing STI testing, the youth revealed that she had met a man on the Internet and had been raped. Police and CPS reports were filed, and her mother was brought into the clinic. Staff revealed to the mother what had happened, because the student was afraid to tell her. The mother was extremely supportive and planned to connect the young woman to Kaiser for care. She thanked SHC staff profusely for the support provided to her and her daughter. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 56through medical visits with providers and health education/outreach activities. Medical visits include sports physicals, disease screening, chronic disease management, medicine management, and other primary care services. The SHCs also treat injuries, headaches, abdominal pain, cold/flu symptoms, and other first aid needs. The SHCs also provide sexual/reproductive health services, including contraceptive maintenance, contraceptive counseling/family planning advice, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) counseling. Finally, dental services are offered at eight SHCs. Most visits are for screening, assessment, and examinations, and the rest are for preventive services. Referrals and follow-up care are provided as needed. Youth and Community Services The SHCs offer education and outreach activities ranging from health fairs and other schoolwide events to workshops on parenting or healthy relationships, The SHC also offer a wide range of nutrition and physical education activities. SHCs provide leadership development and mentoring through peer health education programs and youth advisory boards. They also provide a variety of programming including sports, tutoring, dance, arts, media, and gardening during lunch or after school. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Measure A funds supported 15 of the 27 SHCs. Measure A provides a unique, long-term funding stream to the CHSC to offer school-based health supports for children and youth in Alameda County. Very few other funding sources exist to provide ongoing, stable, and substantial funding to finance the growing network and investment in school health services. The SHCs used their Measure A allocation to achieve the following objectives. Provide comprehensive school health services in a safe, accessible environment on or near the school campus during convenient hours SHCs continue to expand. In FY 14/15, the SHCs served three elementary, 10 middle, and 18 high schools. During the same period, the number of clients increased from 5,010 to 14,446 (a 188% increase), and the number of annual client visits increased from 18,818 to 60,780 visits (a 223% increase). The SHCs also served more than 1,000 clients from the broader community, including high school graduates, college students, siblings, and community members. SHCs are open during school hours and often after school as well. Nearly one-quarter of visits were drop-in, demonstrating the flexibility of the Matching Funds The School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain $10,278,268 in matching funds from Medi-Cal and other third-party billing; the Tobacco Master Settlement Fund (TMSF); and other funding from the County, cities, school districts, the state, the federal government, and private grants.Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$1,924,740$10,278,268 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 57services. In addition, SHC services are available at no cost to clients, regardless of their insurance status, thus filling a gap for students who are uninsured or underinsured. Nearly one in five clients were reported to have no insurance. Of those clients with data recorded, 26% did not have a primary care medical home and 28% did not have a regular dental provider. Without an SHC onsite, many students might have been sent home\u2014 leading them to miss a portion of the school day\u2014rather than having their health issues addressed on site and being sent back to class. Provide SHC clients with referrals to necessary health and wellness services SHCs offer a full scope of integrated services with easy referrals among providers. Clients return for multiple visits to the SHCs, demonstrating the value of integrated and youth-friendly services. Provide first aid, medical, and health education services SHCs help clients with a variety of medical concerns. The SHCs provide vital care for health problems that could interfere with students' ability to attend and succeed in school. SHCs provide education and interventions to encourage healthy behaviors, such as delayed sexual initiation and contraceptive use. According to clinic data, female contraceptive use improved significantly over time. Provide behavioral health services Individual and group behavioral health services were provided during 21% of all visits to 3,015 clients. A sample of clients were tracked over time and improvements were reported in clients' presenting problems and observed strengths. Provide dental health services SHCs are increasingly providing vital dental services to their clients. At the eight sites providing services in FY 14/15, 22% of all visits (1,045 clients) had a dental service provided. Many of the visits resulted in identification of suspicious areas of decay or urgent needs. Provide additional nonclinical services such as youth development and school climate services SHCs integrate health and education through broader student and community educational programs. Overall, SHCs had 18,650 contacts Highlights Comprehensive health services were provided at or near Alameda County schools to an increasing number of students compared to previous years. Care provided included primary medical care, first aid, health education, behavioral health services, and dental care at eight school sites, as well as referrals to additional sources of care when needed. SHC evaluation data showed that SHCs are providing safe places for youth to get needed care: 61% of clients returned for more than one visit, indicating high patient satisfaction and that patients feel welcomed and safe in the clinics. Compared to non-users, significantly more clients reported \"always\" receiving counseling (31% users vs. 24% non-users) , and health services (39% vs. 25%). 87% said, \"The SHC helped otherwise get.\" 87% said, \"The SHC helped get help sooner than I normally would.\" 95% said, \"The people who work there helped me work through my problem.\" 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 58with adult participants such as family members, school staff, and other school community members through these events and activities. Eight of the SHCs have a Youth Advisory Board and 10 have a Peer Health Education or Peer Mentoring program, where students develop leadership skills and learn to give classroom presentations on various health issues. CONCERNS The provider reported program results, including statistics, for the 27 schools served by SHCs\u2014not for the 15 SHCs specifically funded by Measure A. The results for these 15 schools might differ considerably from the average of the 27 SHCs. Given the sizable allocation of almost $2 million, the provider should report more precise information to the Oversight Committee.Highlights Survey data indicated that SHCs are helping youth with overall health and healthy behaviors.

The CP program primarily provides case management, with some medical evaluation. These efforts include assisting with house cleaning, locating family members with whom clients had lost contact, and connecting clients with programs and activities in the community. CPs spend a lot of time with each client's family members to educate them on the client's chronic conditions and to aid in reaching out for other services. CP program objectives include the following: Enroll post-hospital discharge patients who were admitted for congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart attack, sepsis, and pneumonia, as well as frequent utilizers of emergency services, into the program Assess enrollees' needs for additional medical, mental health, and social services Help clients secure primary care physicians Connect clients with specialists: cardiologists, neurologists, pulmonologists, etc. Secure in-home support services or facilitate an increase in hours previously allotted to clients Assist with establishing physical or occupational therapy services for clients in their homes Connect clients with local resources and outreach programs, such as the Alameda Food Bank, Meals on Wheels, Alameda Friendly Visitors, Alameda Point Collaborative, and Mastick Senior Center Obtain medical equipment for clients, such as wheelchairs, walkers, canes, commodes, bedside rails, etc. Assist clients with their prescription medications, including medication education, picking up prescriptions from the pharmacy, and disposing of medications that had expired or were no longer prescribed Perform home safety evaluations for clients, ensuring that smoke/Allocation: $750,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $187,050 Individuals served by Measure A: 13 (Total individuals served: 13) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Emergency MedicalService area: Alameda, Homeless or transientFire Station Health Portals Measure A Helps A 79-year-old woman with special needs due to her medical condition was referred to the CP program. She had MS, chronic back pain, and limited use of her hands. Because her neurologist was in San Francisco, she had not had an appointment in years. She received County-provided caregiver support during weekdays, but on weekends she was alone and struggled with activities such as preparing food. Thanks to the CPs, her caregiver hours were increased to include weekends. A neurologist was found whose office is ten minutes from her house.

CPs worked with discharge planners and physicians from Alameda Hospital to receive referred post-discharge and frequent utilizer patients, and to clarify discharge instructions, medications, and follow-up plans. Using its Measure A funding, the CP program achieved the following: Enrolled five clients into the post-discharge program. Enrolled 11 clients into the frequent utilizers program. Provided 15 total combination referral/assistance efforts. CPs not only referred clients to other health and social services in the County, they also helped clients develop a plan for returning to employment, reconnect with family members, and rekindle the desire to resume past healthy hobbies. Provided 49 total combination face-to-face visits and assessments. CPs visited clients in their homes, in the emergency department, and at a local clinic. CPs performed medical, bio-psych-social, and home safety assessments. CPs also performed medication reconciliation for each client.The CP program used its Measure A allocation to work on establishing pathways for referrals and case management with medical and social service providers within the County. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 61BACk GROUND The City of Fremont's Human Services Department (HSD) supports a vibrant community through services that empower individuals, strengthen families, encourage self-sufficiency, enhance neighborhoods, and foster a high quality of life for all residents.

Health Inequities & Community Capacity-Building Immunization Promote the elimination of vaccine-preventable diseases by implementing the California Immunization Registry program (CAIR) in Alameda County.Measure A Helps DIABETES The California Thoroughbred Horsemen's Foundation asked the diabetes program to provide diabetes education for the workers at Berkeley's Golden Gate Fields. The foundation has a small onsite clinic with a medical provider two mornings a week. Since the program's usual eight-week diabetes course would not fit the workers' schedules, the program suggested a monthly diabetes class and support group. In addition, the clinic's minimal services limited access to care and did not offer a continuity of diabetes care that is critical in preventing complications. What's more, many of the workers were uninsured and were not aware of HealthPAC. CCNI set up onsite enrollment for Medicaid, HealthPAC, and Covered California. 2014-2015 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 108 Support medical providers who strive to improve their immunization rates and prevent diseases for their patients.
