HEIMPEL2 1Department of Entomology, University of California-Davis Davis, CA 95616 jctlee@ucdavis.edu 2Department of Entomology, University of Minnesota St. Paul, MN 55108 heimp001@umn.edu ABSTRACT Diversifying agroecosystems with floral habitats has the potential to conserve natural en-emies and enhance pest control. In the laboratory, many adult parasitoids readily utilizenectar sources that have substantially increased their longevity and parasitism rates. How-ever, in the field, does the floral habitat retain parasitoids locally so they exert greater controlon pests? We studied Plutellidae). First, sugar-fed and hungry D. insulare were compared for retention inside cabbage plots (12 x 20 m in 2003; 9 x 15 m in 2004). Sugar-fed and hungry wasps were marked, released inside the plot and recaptured outside the bor-der over 1-3 days. Sugar feeding did not appear to affect dispersal behavior of D. insulare in the field. Second, we determined whether sugar sources attracted/retained parasitoids in thecrop field by monitoring the abundance of D. insulare inside cabbage plots (12 m x 20 m) bordered by 3 m wide buckwheat strips and cabbage plots devoid of floral habitat. For threesummers, D. insulare were monitored within plots using sticky traps, and the number of adults captured in plots with and without floral borders did not differ. Neither experimentshowed evidence that buckwheat flowers increased retention of D. insulare . INTRODUCTION Establishing nectar-producing floral habitats within or near crop fields can provide adult parasitoids with sugar and reduce risks and energetic costs of commuting between food andhost sources (Lewis et al. 1998). Parasitoids orient towards nectar odors (Patt et al. 1999; W\u00e4ckers 2004) and floral colors (W\u00e4ckers 1994). Thus, the presence of sugar sources in a hostpatch should retain parasitoids locally. Host patches of five cotton plants with extrafloralnectar and sucrose have retained Microplitis croceipes (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) 31.5-34.5 minutes whereas host patches without sugar retained parasitoids for 14 minutes(Stapel et al. 1997). Not surprisingly, parasitoids have been found to aggregate more among crops with floral vegetation (Berndt et al. 2002; Irvin et al. 2000; Stephens et al. 1998) or sugar__________________________ Impact of Sugar Feeding on Physiology and Behavior of a Parasitoid Wasp Second International Symposium on Biological Control of Arthropods399sprays (Jacob and Evans 1998) than crops without such resources. Also, parasitoid abun- dance (Platt et al. 1999) and parasitism rates (Baggen and Gurr 1998; Tylianakis et al. 2004) have been observed to decline in the crop as distance from a floral border increased. Contrary to expectations, an increase in parasitism rates does not always occur in the presence of floral nectar (Berndt et al. 2002; Irvin et al. 2000). The expectation that supple- mentary nectar improves biological control, may not apply if parasitoids have sufficient sugarsources without supplemental floral nectar, parasitoids do not feed from the nectar, or ifparasitoid longevity and fecundity are not improved feeding (Heimpel and Jervis2005). The parasitoid Diadegma insulare has been studied for some these it attacks diamondback moth larvae Plutella Presence of tary floral nectar sometimes increased feeding by D. insulare (Lee et al. in prep), increased longevity and the number of eggs laid per female per hour (Lee and Heimpel in prep), but hadlittle impact on resulting parasitism rates (Lee and Heimpel in review). The lack of correla-tion between feeding and parasitism puts into question whether the behavior of D. insulare following sugar feeding may differ from expected. While sugar-fed parasitoids may search for hosts immediately near the sugar source, parasitoids may eventually disperse to other host patches. Feeding provides ample carbohy-drate reserves (Fadamiro and Heimpel 2001; Lee et al. 2004; Olson et al. 2000) that fuel flight and may induce dispersal and not retention. Some studies support increased flight activitywith sugar feeding. In flight chambers, Trichogramma minutum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) given honey showed a small but significant 6% increase in the propen-sity to fly than starved females (Forsse et al. 1992). Whether this would reflect a tendency for dispersal flight is not known. In a field study, Hyposoter sp. (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) wasps were marked with the trace element Rubidium if they fed on marked floral nectarsources; and fed wasps were captured more frequently at 75 m than at 6 m or less from markedplants (Freeman-Long et al. 1998). Parasitoids may also disperse to increase their fitness. First, parasitoids that cannot discriminate between hosts that have been parasitized may leave a patch early than risk super-parasitism and wasting eggs (Rosenheim and Mangel 1994). D. insulare appears to lay eggs randomly among hosts in the field without avoidance of superparasitism (Lee and Heimpel2004). Or, D. insulare may be dispersing to other patches to avoid inbreeding since this species can have severe inbreeding depression due to its single-locus complementary sex de-termination (CSD) (Butcher et al. 2000). Parasitoids may also disperse to avoid positively density-dependent hyperparasitism (Ayal and Green 1993). Or parasitoids may 'spread therisk' in case of widespread mortality occurring in a single host patch, but the conditions forusing risk spreading over space are rather stringent (Hopper 1999). While sugar feeding can benefit parasitoids including D. insulare , the impacts that floral sources have on longer-term parasitoid behavior are not known. Our objectives were todetermine how sugar feeding influences D. insulare 's dispersal in and out of a host patch at a greater spatial and temporal scale: 12 x 20 m or 9 x 15 m cabbage plot for 8 hours or longer.Also, we compared the number of D. insulare in cabbage plots with/without floral borders for evidence of enhanced attraction/retention.Second International Symposium on Biological Control of ArthropodsLee and Heimpel ______________________________________________________________________________ 400MATERIALS AND METHODS FIELD PATCH STUDY We conducted a mark-recapture experiment on sugar/nectar-fed and hungry D. insulare to study retention in a field plot. A 12 x 20 m cabbage plot with 12 cabbage rows was plantedwith seedling transplants on 5 June 2003 within a soybean field at the Rosemount Field Sta-tion. Three mark-recapture trials were started on 9, 15 and 23 September 2003. Experimentswere conducted late in the season since natural populations of D. insulare had declined, and possible sugar sources such as honeydew from soybean aphids in the surrounding field werenot available. Four large sticky traps were set up along each border of the plot, 16 traps total,during the 1 st trial. Seven sticky traps were set up per side, 28 total, during the 2nd and 3rd trials (Fig. 1). Sticky traps were 1 x 0.91 m in size composed of grey window screening (mesh size 1 x 2 mm). Traps stood about 40-50 cm aboveground and ~2 m from the plot edge to increase theprobability of catching dispersing wasps rather than wasps foraging low for hosts or seekingshelter. Screens were stapled to 4 x 4 x 183 cm wooden stakes pounded into the ground. At8 am, an aerosol formula of Tangle-Trap\u00ae was sprayed onto the screening. Tangle-Trap\u00aewas reapplied at noon and at the end of the day. In the following year (2004), a 9 x 15 m cabbage plot with 9 cabbage rows was handplanted with seedlings on 3 June 2004 in the St. Paul Agricultural Experimental Field. Field corn andsoybeans were the predominant surrounding vegetation. Weeds were removed by hand andobvious floral nectar sources were not apparent. Mark-recapture trials were started on 18, 24and 31 July 2004 before natural populations of D. insulare had built up. Seven sticky traps were set up along the length of the plot and six along the width, 26 traps total. In 2003, we used D. insulare from our laboratory colony (1 st-3rd generation) started in August 2003 from wild populations. In 2004, we used laboratory reared colonies from bothMinnesota and Apopka, Florida. To recruit large numbers of wasps, all wasps emerging 1-5Figure 1.

Fed wasps were given buckwheat flowers, 20% sucrose or 20% honey solutions ad libitum . Since D. insulare die in 1-2 days without food (Lee et al. 2004), hungry wasps were initially maintained on the same sugar foods until 20 h before release when only water was provided. D. insulare fed buckwheat nectar metabolize most of their gut sugars when starved for 12-36 h (Lee 2004). Wasps emergingwithin 20 h of release were also used, those placed in the hungry treatment did not have anyopportunity to feed. Before release, wasps were sexed and aspirated in groups of 50 into 1 oz.plastic vials. To mark wasps, they were first chilled for 5 minutes at -10\u00b0 C, transferred intoa 1 oz. plastic cup with 6 mg of pink or yellow fluorescent powder (Day-Glo Color Corp.)and tumbled. This procedure moderately dusts D. insulare without affecting their longevity, and the powder remains visible in their thoracic crevices 13-16 days later despite the waspsgrooming themselves (Lee 2004). Wasps were released in the center of the cabbage plot at 9 am. Some overdusted wasps died or moved little. We counted dead/inactive wasps at the release site at 10 am and sub-tracted this number to estimate the number of wasps released. About 500 diamondback lar-vae were sprinkled onto cabbage plants to ensure hosts for females. Sticky screens weremonitored every half hour after release of wasps, marked D. insulare were collected and fro- zen with the time, trap number, and height from ground recorded. For the 1 st trial in 2003, D. insulare were monitored from 9:00-17:00 on day 1 only. For the 2nd trial, D. insulare were monitored from 9:00-18:00 on day 1, 10:30-15:00 on day 2, and 12:00-14:00 on day 3. Duringthe 3 rd trial, monitoring occurred from 9:00-18:00 on day 1, and 10:00-12:00 on day 2. In trial 1 of 2004, wasps were monitored from 9:00-18:00 on day 1, and 9:00-10:00 on day 2; in trial 2from 9:20-18:00 on day 1, and 8:20-15:00 on day 2; in trial 3 from 9:00-19:00 on day 1, and8:00-10:00 on day 2. Dead wasps collected during the morning of the second and third dayhad likely been captured the previous evening because D. insulare are not active at night or early morning (Idris and Grafius 1998). We therefore estimated that they had been caught by8 pm of the previous day, which is the latest time that D. insulare have been reported active (Idris and Grafius 1998). Wind speeds exceeding 8.5 m/s prevented us from monitoring waspsfor a longer duration during trials 1 and 3 in 2003. Collected wasps were frozen at -80\u00b0 Cuntil egg load determination and biochemical analyses could be done for lipid, glycogen,fructose and total sugar levels as described in Lee et al. (2004). Prior to biochemical analyses, the Tangle-Trap\u00ae was removed from wasps using the following protocol. Each wasp wasvortexed for 30 s in a 1 oz. plastic cup with 0.5 ml of De-Solv-it\u00ae degreasing solvent and thenvortexed in 2 ml of distilled water for 30 s and again with new water. Next, each wasp wastransferred into a clean cup and vortexed with distilled water twice and blotted dry on aKimwipe\u00ae. The proportion of recaptured water-fed and sugar-fed wasps were analyzed by trial in a Chi-square analysis. The effect of treatment (water or sugar) on height and time of recapturewere compared using an ANOVA. Effect of treatment on egg load, lipid, glycogen, fructoseand sugar levels of wasps were tested in an ANCOVA with wing length as a covariate. Im-pact of feeding as measured by fructose levels (independent variable) on time and height ofrecapture and remaining egg load was tested with linear regressions. Analyses were con-ducted in JMP\u00ae (SAS Institute 1995).Second International Symposium on Biological Control of ArthropodsLee and Heimpel ______________________________________________________________________________ 402AGGREGATION NEAR BUCKWHEAT We monitored the abundance of D. insulare in 12 x 20 m cabbage plots with and without 3 m wide borders of buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum (Moench) as described in Lee and Heimpel (in review). In 2001, four buckwheat and four control plots were at least 67 m apart from eachother and embedded in a soybean field. Another four buckwheat and control plots werespaced at least 800 m apart, embedded in separate soybean fields. These plots are referred toas nearby and isolated. In 2002 and 2003, eight cabbage plots were planted at least 800 m apartand in separate soybean fields. Cabbage plots were not treated with insecticide, and plantedin new sites each year. In 2001, four yellow sticky traps (Pherocon \u00aeAM) were set up randomly per plot. Traps were 30 cm aboveground and between two cabbage plants to collect D. insulare as they moved along a cabbage row. Traps were collected after one week in the field on 16, 23, 30 August2001 from nearby plots and 14, 21, 28 August from isolated plots. In 2002-2003, six yellowsticky traps were set up per plot at random points and in the field for one week. Traps werecollected on 22, 28 July, 5, 12, 19, 26 August and 2 September in 2002, and on 14, 21, 28 Julyand 4, 12, 18, 26 August in 2003. We tested the effects of treatment, year, and treatment x yearinteractions on the total number of D. insulare captured per trap using ANOVA on square- root transformed data. Since trap collections occurred at different times each year, only trapscollected during the last three weeks of August were included in the three-year analysis. Maleand female D. insulare were distinguished in 2002 and 2003. Average numbers of females captured per weekly trap over 7 weeks were tested in a similar ANOVA described earlier. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION FIELD PATCH STUDY The field patch study did not support the prediction that feeding would lead to either greaterretention or dispersal. Water- and sugar/nectar-fed wasps did not have different nutrientlevels in the 1 st and 2nd trial in 2003 and in 3rd trial in 2004 (Table 1) to adequately test treat- ment effects. In trial 2 of 2003, more water-fed than sugar-fed D. insulare were recaptured outside the plot but these wasps did not differ in their lipid, glycogen, total sugar and fructoselevels. Since there was no physiological difference between water- and sugar-fed wasps, wecannot conclude that feeding enabled wasps to remain in the patch longer. When water andsugar-fed wasps differed physiologically in the 3 rd trial of 2003, and 1st and 2nd trials of 2004 (Table 1), there were no significant differences in recapture rates, time and height of recap-ture, and number of eggs remaining in ovaries. Marginal differences were observed twice.Water-fed wasps had marginally greater egg loads than sugar-fed wasps (p=0.062) in trial 1 of2004. This may suggest that feeding enabled more ovipositional activity, but the analysis wasbased on only four females. Sugar-fed wasps were recaptured marginally later than water-fedwasps in 3 rd trial of 2003 (p = 0.099). This could indicate that being fed enables wasps to remain longer in a host patch (Stapel et al. 1997), but can also occur if sugar-fed wasps simply lived longer and were recaptured later.__________________________ Impact of Sugar Feeding on Physiology and Behavior of a Parasitoid Wasp Second International Symposium on Biological Control of Arthropods403Table 1.

A negative slope suggests that wasps with morefructose were caught earlier in the experiment, contrary to our previous finding that sugar-fed wasps were recaptured marginally later than water-fed wasps in trial 3 of 2003. Thismight reflect fructose levels having declined more in wasps caught at later times, particularlythe next day. Next, D. insulare with higher fructose levels were recaptured higher on the traps (Fig. 2b) suggesting that feeding correlates with flying higher aboveground. If a higherflight level indicates dispersal behavior compared to foraging behavior, this study might sup-port the hypothesis that feeding leads to more dispersal. However, the distinction betweendispersal and foraging flight is not known. Lastly, there was no relationship between fruc-tose levels and the number of eggs remaining in ovaries (F 1,72 = 0.50, p = 0.48). Egg load is influenced by ovipositional activity and egg maturation rate. For M. croceipes , fed wasps oviposited more than did unfed wasps in host patches devoid of food (Takasu and Lewis1995). Our results did not show D. insulare to be as amenable to sugar provisioning for improving biological control as other species. Yet, our experiment may have a limited scopesince only wasps moving outside the plot were monitored. Wasps that remained within thehost patch might have exhibited different behaviors based on their nutritional state but theywere not monitored. Figure 2.

Captures varied significantly by year (F2,26 = 29.6, p = 0.0001) with the highest captures in 2003. In 2002-03, females were distinguished from males on traps andtraps were placed in the field for a longer period of time. Females captured per trap per weekover a 7-week period did not vary by treatment (F 1,26 = 0.50, p = 0.49) nor by the treatment x year interaction (F1,26 = 0.94, p = 0.35) but varied significantly by year (F1,26 = 52.4, p = 0.0001) (Fig. 3b).__________________________ Impact of Sugar Feeding on Physiology and Behavior of a Parasitoid Wasp Second International Symposium on Biological Control of Arthropods405Over three years, buckwheat borders did not enhance aggregation of D. insulare within cabbage plots. This differs from previous studies with buckwheat (Berndt et al. 2002; Irvin et al. 2000; Stephens et al. 1998), although English-Loeb et al. (2003) only found more parasi- toids near the crop edge next to the buckwheat but not in the crop interior. D. insulare might not have responded to buckwheat borders since other sugar sources were present in vegeta-tion surrounding cabbage plots, such as honeydew produced by soybean aphids, Aphis gly- cines Matsumura, that have recently invaded Minnesota soybean fields. However, floral nec- tar can have more attractive odors to parasitoids than aphid-infested leaves (W\u00e4ckers andSwaans 1992). Buckwheat flowers are white, a color that may elicit more responses by para-sitoids (Begum et al. 2004). Also, female D. insulare live three-fold longer on buckwheat nectar than soybean aphid honeydew (Lee et al. 2004). Given the superiority of buckwheat flowers to other common foods in the field, we might still expect to find a numerical increaseof D. insulare in buckwheat versus control plots. We did not observe such an increase sug- gesting that D. insulare was not attracted or retained by buckwheat flowers. Recent olfacto- meters studies confirm this, both fed and unfed D. insulare showed a little if any response to buckwheat floral odors compared to buckwheat foliage without flowers (Heimpel andZimmermann, unpublished). An alternative interpretation is that buckwheat may increaselocal aggregation of D. insulare but feeding also reduces their activity levels such that no differences would be observed in the amount collected in the traps.
