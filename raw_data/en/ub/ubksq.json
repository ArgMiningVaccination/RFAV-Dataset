Organization and Functions of the Immune System REVIEW: Cahalan MD. Gutman GA. The sense of place in the immune system. Nat Immunol. 2006;7:329-32 This series of reviews examines the effect of differing tissue environm ents on the activity and functional capacity of cells in th e immune system. From their orig ins as hematopoietic stem cells, throughout their development and as mature cells, cel ls of the immune system find themselves in distinct and highly specialized niches, and contact with antigen or inflammatory signals changes their phenotype, activity and tra fficking. Two-photon microscopy has provided the first direct observations of living cells and th eir activation choreogra phy in the tissue environment and will no doubt continue to provide grea ter understanding of cellular dynamics and immune function. a. Thymic development and shaping peripheral systemic T-cell immunity REVIEW: Zuniga-Pflucker JC. T-cell development made simple. Nat Rev Immunol 2004;4:67-72. The thymus is the primary site of T-cell ly mphopoiesis. However, the precise molecular interactions that enable the thym us to carry out this function are only recently being elucidated. Although several important molecula r players have been identifie d, including soluble factors, extracellular matrix components, and integral me mbrane receptors and th eir ligands, the precise role of these molecules in thymocyte differentia tion has yet to be fully characterized. In this regard, the advent of a simple a nd efficient culture system for the generation of T cells from stem cells, as discussed here, should greatly facilitate the study of T-cell development. REVIEW: Hayday AC. Key factors in the organized chaos of early T cell development. Nat Immunol. 2007;8:137-44 A fundamental issue in T cell development is wh at controls whether a thymocyte differentiates into a gammadelta T cell or an alphabeta T cell, each defined by their distinct T cell receptor. Most likely, lessons learned in studying that issue will also provide insight into how the thymus produces T cell subsets with distin ct functional and regulatory poten tials. Here we review recent experiments, focusing on three factors that regula te thymocyte differentiation up to and including the expression of the first products of antigen rece ptor gene rearrangements. Those factors are the archetypal developmental regulator Notch, intrinsic signals emanating from antigen-receptor complexes, and trans conditioning, which reflects communication between different subsets of thymocytes. We also review new findings on th e positive selection of gammadelta T cells and on extrathymic T cell development. 10RESEARCH FRONTIER: Rothenberg EV. Cell lineage regulators in B and T cell development. Nat Immun ol. 2007;8:441-4, 2007 This special issue highlights a pivotal set of regulatory molecules that have emerged as central controllers of cell-type identity in the immune sy stem. Each in its own way has been considered as a kind of 'master' regulator of a particular cell fate choice, but the actual modes of action of these factors vary widely. The comparison among them sheds light on the different ways that an essential regulatory input can affect cellular identity. b. Cutaneous Immunity REVIEW: Berger CL. Langerhans cells: mediators J Cell Biol. 38(10):1632-6, 2006. Langerhans cells provide the epidermis with a su rveillance network that samples the external environment influencing the decision between im munity and tolerance. Langerhans cells are immature dendritic cells acquiring antigens from fo reign invaders as well as damaged native tissue for display to the immune response. The current pa radigm suggests that the state of maturity of Langerhans cells, defined by the display of molecules that provoke immune responses (histocompatibility, co-stimulators, adhesion and homing receptors), determines whether emigration of the Langerhans cell to lymph nodes si gnals immunity or tolerance. Other factors such as type of immunogen ingested, environmenta l danger signals and the level of cell death may also play a role in tipping the balance towa rds immunity or immunosuppression. As modulators of the immune response, Langerhans cells play a role in cutaneous autoimmunity in lupus and in cancers that have an affinity for the ep idermis such as cuta neous T cell lymphoma Immunity REVIEW: Teitelbaum development of mucosal immunity. Eur J Gastro Hepatol 2005;17:1273-8. The development of the intestinal immune system is a complex sequence of events that begins in utero under various genetic influenc es, but continues after birth, bei ng modified by factors such as bacteria, hormones and feeds. This review discusses what is known about the ontogeny of each aspect of the mucosal immune system so as to provide a better unde rstanding of how aberrations in the system might lead to systemic disease. REVIEW: Dubois B. Oral tolerance and regulatio n of mucosal immunity. Cell Mol Life Sci 2005 62(12):1322-32. Regulated mechanisms sustain the ability of the gut immune system to discriminate harmless food antigens (Ag) and commensal bacteria from pathogenic microorganisms, resulting in tolerance versus protective immunity, resp ectively. Antigens of the gut co mmensals are not simply ignored, but rather trigger an active im munosuppressive process, more commonly known as oral tolerance, 11which prevents the outcome of immunopathol ogy. Both intrinsic pr operties of the gut microenvironment and cellular actors, as well as peripheral events induced by systemic dissemination of oral Ag, promote the inducti on of regulatory mechanisms that ensure maintenance of gut homeostasis. The aim of this review is to provide a synthetic update on the mechanisms of oral tolerance, with partic ular emphasis on the complex interplay between regulatory CD4+ T cells, dendritic ce lls and the gut microenvironment. d. Primary Immune Function of Cellu lar Elements of the Immune System i. T-cells REVIEW: Jiang H. Regulation of Immune Responses by T cells N Engl J Med 2006;354:1166-76 The T-cell branch of the immune system can respond to a virtually infinite variety of antigens, in part because it includes a very large repertoire of T-cell clones, each with a unique receptor for antigen. It is inevitable that this diverse repe rtoire contains T cells with receptors that can recognize the body's own antigens self-reactive T cells \u2014 and in stigate harmful autoimmunity. For this reason, a means of restra ining such T cells is essentia l. The controls depend on two mechanisms that not only avert autoimmunity but also maintain protective immunity: shaping of the T-cell repertoire in the thym us and regulation of T cells in the periphery. The proposal that peripheral regulatory mechanisms have a key role in the immune response, advanced more than three decades ago by Richard Gershon, was based on two concepts \u2014 homeostasis and the potential for autoimmunity.1 The immune system is indeed a homeostatic organization that must regulate itself to avert insuffi cient immunity and suppress exce ssive responses. Protective immunity has a considerable potential for er ror because it entails the production of potent proinflammatory molecules and killer cells that can destroy not only in vading microorganisms and cancer cells but also normal cells. To ensure e ffective immunity to foreign antigens but avert pathogenic autoimmunity in the periphery, the immune system must control the magnitude and class of immune responses but also discriminate self from nonself. The control of magnitude and class is accomplished by intrinsic homeostatic mechanisms, whereas self-nonself discrimination is mediated largely by suppressor T cells, a term originally coined by Gershon1 These two immunoregulatory mechanisms have direct clinical relevance to autoimmune diseases, allograft rejection, responses to pathogens, and antitumor immunit y. It is likely that an understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of immune re gulation will generate new ways of preventing and treating immune-mediated diseas es. How T cells mediate these mechanisms is the topic of this review. REVIEW: Bacchetta R. The role of regulatory T cells and FoxP3 in human disease J Allergy Clin Immunol 2007;120:227-235 Immune regulation and tolerance are specific fu nctions of the immune system, meaning at prevention or limitation of effector immune res ponses against inner and external insults. Regulatory T (Treg) cells are cruc ial players in this immune ba lance network. Research over the last 10 years has significantly contributed to char acterizing Treg cell features, their mechanisms of 12function, and their role in human pathologies . The discovery of FO XP3 a s an essential transcription factor not only for differentiation an d function of naturally occurring Treg cells but also for regulation of intracellula r molecules related to effector T-cell responses has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases. In terestingly, there is increasing evidence that the individual si gnature of genes relevant for immune regulation definitely influences the final outcome of an immune response. ii. B cells REVIEW: Vascotto F. Antigen presentation by B lymphocytes: how receptor signaling directs membrane trafficking. Curr Opin Immunol 2007; 19:354-64. Antigen capture and presentation onto MHC clas s II molecules by B lymphocytes is mediated by their surface antigen receptor - the B-cell receptor (BCR). The BCR must therefore coordinate the transport of MHC class II- and antigen-containing vesicles for them to converge and ensure efficient processing. Recently, progress has been made in understanding which and how these vesicular transport events are molecularly linke d to BCR signaling. In par ticular, recent studies have emphasized the key roles of membrane microdomains and the actin cytoskeleton in regulation of upon BCR engagement. REVIEW: McHeyzer LJ Antigen-specific memory B development Ann Rev Immunol 2005;23:487-513 Helper T (Th) cell-regulated B cell immunity pr ogresses in an ordered cascade of cellular development that culminates in the producti on of antigen-specific memory B cells. The recognition of peptide MHC class II complexes on ac tivated antigen-presenting cells is critical for effective Th cell selectio n, clonal expansion, and effector Th cell function development (Phase I). Cognate effector Th cell-B cell interactions then promote the development of either short-lived plasma cells (PCs) or germinal centers (GCs) (P hase These and select high-affinity variants of antigen-specific B cells for entry into the long-lived memory B cell compartment (Phase III). Upon antigen rechallenge, memory B cells rapidly expand and differentiate into PCs under the c ognate control of memory Th cells (Phase IV). We review the cellular and molecular regulators of this dynamic process with emphasis on the multiple memory B cell fates that develop in vivo. REVIEW: Mizoguchi, A. A case for regulatory B cells J Immunol 2006;176:705-10 B cells are typically characterized by their ab ility to produce Abs, including autoantibodies. However, B cells possess additional immune functi ons, including the produc tion of cytokines and the ability to function as a secondary APC. As with T cells, the B ce ll population contains functionally distinct subsets cap able of performing both pathog enic and regulatory functions. Recent studies indicate that regulatory B cells develop in several murine models of chronic 13inflamm ation, including inflammato ry bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The regulatory function may be directly accomplished by the production of regulatory cytokines IL -10 and TGF-beta and/or by the ab ility of B cells to interact with pathogenic T cells to damp en harmful immune responses. In this review, we make a case for the existence of regulatory B cells and discuss th e possible developmental pathways and functional mechanisms of these B cells. iii. Neutrophils REVIEW: Wang Q. Neutrophils in 33-41 Neutrophils are an important co mponent of innate immunity in the lungs. During bacterial pneumonia, neutrophils are recruite d from the capillaries of the pulmonary circulation in the gas- exchanging regions of the lungs. This process re quires the coordinated ac tivation of many cells within the lungs, including neutrophils and capillary endothelial cells. Cellular activation during innate immune responses is mediated in part by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- ) and interleukin (IL)-1-initiated signali ng through their receptor s, activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) and downstream gene transcription, endoth elial cell signaling in by neutrophil adherence molecu le (ICAM)-1, and binding of leukocyte adhesion molecules to cellular and matrix ligands. These events are essential to effective host defense during pneumonia REVIEW: Burg ND, Pillinger MH. The Neutrophil: Function and Humoral Immunity. Clin Immunol 2001;99:7-17 The neutrophil is a critical effector cell in humor al and innate immunity and plays vital roles in phagocytosis and bacterial killing. Discussed here are the neutrophil components necessary for these processes and the diseases in which these components are either lacking or dysfunctional, illustrating that normal neutrophil function is vital for health. REVIEW: Segal AW. How neutrophils kill microbes Ann Rev Immmunol 2005;23;197-223 Neutrophils provide the first lin e of defense of the innate immune system by phagocytosing, killing, and digesting bacteria and fungi. Killing was previously believed to be accomplished by oxygen free radicals and other reactive oxygen species generated by the NADPH oxidase, and by oxidized halides produced by myel operoxidase. We now know this is incorrect. The oxidase pumps electrons into the phagocytic vacuole, thereby inducing a ch arge across the membrane that must be compensated. The movement of compen sating ions produces cond itions in the vacuole conducive to microbial killing a nd digestion by enzymes released into the vacuole from the cytoplasmic granules. RESEARCH enging phagocytes ex tracellular spac es of rapidly proliferating microbes; they are al so active in the contro l of infections by intracellular pathogens. Several mechanisms for nonphagocytic roles of neut rophils in protective immunity have been put forth over the years but further evidence has recen tly been accumulating at an increasing pace. In this review, I present the eviden ce that suggests neutrophils are i nvolved in pathogen shuttling into the lymphoid tissues, in antigen presentation, and in early T cell recruitm ent and initiation of granuloma organization. Also, a cl earer view on the antimicrobial molecules that can be acquired by macrophages to enhance their antimicrobial ac tivity is now emerging. Finally, neutrophils can adversely affect immunity against certain parasites by causing immune deviation. iv. Eosinophils REVIEW: Lee JJ Eosinophil degranulation: an evolutionary function? Clin Exp Allergy 2005; 35:986-994 The goal of is to examine the impor tance of eosinophil degranulation from a 'thinking outside of the box' perspective in an attempt to shed new light on an old problem. In particular, we will pose and answer the questions'What is th e evolutionary origin of eosinophils and degranulation and why is degranulation viewed as the ultimate eosinophil effector function?' More importantly, 'Does the available data support an alternative to the pr evailing hypothesis that degranulation is a destructive e ffector function?' We do not expect to adequately answer these questions and many of our answers may eventually be shownto be incorrect. However, as noted by the 19th centurynaturalist Charles Darwin: 'False views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for everyone takes salutary pl easurein proving their falseness!' REVIEW: Klion AD, Nutman TB The role of eosinophils defense against helminth parasites. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2004;113:30-37 The precise function of eosinophils in parasitic infection in vivo remains poorly understood despite eosinophils having been shown to be potent effector s in killing parasites in vitro. Although it has long been held that the primary function of the eo sinophil is protection agains t helminth parasites, there are little data to prove this unequivocally. Moreover, eo sinophils are responsible for a considerable amount of inflammatory pathology accompanying helminth infections. This article will provide an overview of our current knowle dge about eosinophils and their role, both protective and pathogenetic, in pa rasitic helminth infections. v. Mast Immunol 15It is becoming increasingly evident that the c ontribution of mast cells to both physiologic and pathologic processes extends far beyond their accepted role in alle rgic disease. The accum ulation and activation of lesional mast cells as observe d in several chronic infl ammatory and fibrotic processes such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, chronic graft-versus-host disease, and scar tissue suggest their involve ment.[ Several morphologic and functional features of mast cells enable them to contri bute to nonallergic inflammatory processes. Mast cells are strategically poised at perivascular sites to regulate inflammatory responses. They are also located for optimal interaction with th e environment and for thei r putative functions in host defense. Their predilection to occupy tissues that interface the external environment including the skin and respiratory and gastrointestinal tr acts places them in a unique position to encounter invading organisms and orchestrate a response. Th eir close physical proximity with T cells in inflamed tissues has led investigators to propos e a functional relationshi p between these 2 cell populations that might faci litate the immune response. REVIEW: Boyce JA. Mast Cells: Beyond IgE. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2003;111:24-32 Mast cells, historically known fo r their involvement in type I hypersensitivity, also serve critical protective and homeostatic functions . They directly recognize the products of bacterial infection through several surface receptor proteins, releasing proteases, cytokines, and eicosanoid mediators that recruit neutrophils, limit the spread of bact erial infection, and facili tate subsequent tissue repair. In vitro studies suggest that the spect rum of microbes capable of initiating mast cell activation is broad and extends to common respiratory viruses, my coplasma, and even products of tissue injury, such as nucleotid es. TH2-polarized inflammation e licits a reactive hyperplasia of mast cells at the involved mucosal surfaces in both mice and human subjects. Several recombinant TH2 cytokines (IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-9) act synergistically with stem cell factor to facilitate proliferation of nontransformed human mast cells in vitro. IL-4 induces the expression of critical inflammationassociated genes by human mast cells, such as those encoding only amplifies classical RI-dependent mast cell activation but also dramatica lly alters the product profile of mast cells activated by innate signals and by chemical mediators of inflammation. Strikingly, IL-4 induces an activation response by ma st cells to cysteinyl leukotrienes, which act through a receptor shared with uridine diphosphate to induce cytokine generation wit hout exocytosis. It is possible that alterations in mast cell phenotype by the TH2 milieu of allergy permits otherwise trivial infections or homeostatic chemical signals to initiate harmful inflammatory cascades and sustain tissue pathology. Drug development must take thes e nonclassical mast cell activation pathways into account without compromising the benefi cial and protective functions of mast cells . vi. REVIEW: Gibbs BF Human basophils as effectors and immunomodulat ors of allergic inflammation and innate immunity. Clin Exp Med. 2005 Jul;5(2):43-9. Basophils have often stood in th e shadow of their tissue-fixed mast cell counterparts which share 16some, common features, such as high -affinity IgE receptor expression and the ability to release histamine. That rodent mast cells produce a variet y of pro-allergic and in flammatory cytokines has further added to the deception th at basophils only play a minor role in allergic inflammation. Surprisingly, in humans, basophils, but not mast cells, appear to be the prime early producers of the Th2-type cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, which perf orm several crucial func tions in initiating and maintaining allergic responses. This putative immunomodulatory ro le of basophils is supported further by their ability to expr ess CD40 ligand, which, together w ith IL-4 and IL-13, serve as inductors of B-cell proliferation and class switching to IgE and IgG4. Moreover, human basophils are the main cellular source for rapid IL-4 generation, a mandatory requirement for the development of Th2 responses. Recent specific staining techniques have localized basophils in various tissues affected by allergic diseases and it appears likely, but remains to be proven, that the interaction ofbasophils, T cells a nd B cells at these sites propagate pro-allergic immune responses. Additionally, basophil activa tion is not restricted to antigen- specific IgE crosslinking but can be caused in nonsensitised individuals by parasitic antigens, plant lectins and viral superantigens binding to nonspecific IgEs. Finally, the presence of novel IgE-independent receptor targets that cause trafficking and Th2 cytokine release from basophils further underlines their potential role in innate as well asadaptive immunity. vii. Antigen presenting cells REVIEW: Rossi, M Human dendritic cells: potent antigen-presenti ng cells at the crossroads of innate and adaptive immunity. J Immunol 2005;175:1373-81 Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized, bone marrow- derived leukocytes that are critical to the development of immunity. Investigators have empha sized the role of DCs in initiating adaptive or acquired MHC-restricted, Ag-specific T cell res ponses. More recent evidence supports important roles for DCs in the onset of innate immunity a nd peripheral tolerance. Pr ogress in the generation of DCs from defined hemopoietic precursors in vitro has revealed the heterogeneity of these APCs and their attendant divisions of labor. This review will address these developments in an attempt to integrate the activities of different DCs in coordinating innate and adaptive immunity. REVIEW: Schuurhuis DH Ins and outs of dendritic cells Int Arch Allergy Immunol 2006;140:53-72 Dendritic cells (DC) a re professional antigen-prese nting cells which are strategically positioned at the boundaries between the inner an d the outside world, in this wa y bridging innate and adaptive immunity. DC can initiate T cell responses agains t microbial pathogens and tumors due to their capacity to stimulate naive T cells. The developm ent of DC occurs in distinct stages. DC precursors develop in the bone ma rrow and home to a large variety of tissues. Immature DC capture antigen (Ag) and, following proinflammato ry signals, migrate to the lymphoid organs where, after maturation, they present captured Ag to naive T cells, thereby inducing differentiation of naive T cells into effector T cells. An impor tant cognate event in the development of cell- mediated immunity is the interaction betw een CD40 and CD40 ligand. Ligation of CD40 on DC by its ligand results in maturation of the DC. In addition to CD40 ligand (expressed by activated 17Th cells), inflammatory cytoki nes, bacterial components or Ag -Ab immune complexes can induce m aturation of DC. Maturation of DC is crucial for the priming of efficient T cell responses and is characterized by a decreased Ag processing capac ity, an increased cell su rface expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules, and rearrangement of cytoskeleton, adhesion molecules, and cytokine receptors. Mature DC migrate from peripheral tissues to secondary lymphoid organs, where T cell priming occurs. DC are not only critical in initiating T cell immunity, they also play a role in the induction of T cell tolerance and the re gulation of the type of T cell response that is induced. Here we give an overvie w of the dendritic cell system. Thymic stromal OX40 ligand pathway in the initiation of dendritic cell mediated allergic inflammation. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2007;128:238-244 It was demonstrated 5 years romal lymphopoietin (TSLP) , a IL-7-like cytokine coul d strongly activate human myeloid dendritic cells to induce an inflammatory TH2 response characterized by high TNF-a and little IL-10 pr oduction, distinct from the regulatory TH2 responses characterized by low TNF-a and high IL-10 production. TSLP was found highly expressed by keratinocytes of skin lesions of atopic de rmatitis and associated with dendritic cell activation in situ. This suggests fo r the first time that TSLP represents a master switch of allergic inflammation at the epithelial cell and dendritic cell interface. During the last several years, the evidence for the association of TSLP with human asthma was revealed. The direct link between TSLP expression with the pat hogenesis of atopic dermati tis and asthma in vivo was demonstrated. In addition, OX40 ligand was found to be the TSLP-induced molecule on dendritic cells that triggers inflammatory TH2 di fferentiation in the absence of IL-12. TSLP was also demonstrated to direct the innate phase of allergic immune responses through activating mast cells. Therefore, TSLP and OX40 ligand may repres ent important targets for intervention of the initiation of allergic inflammatory responses. viii. Natural Killer Cells REVIEW: Lodoen MB, Lanier LL. Natural Killer Cells as an in itial defense against pathogens Curr Opin in Immunol 2006, 18:391-398 Natural killer (NK) cells serve as a crucial first line of defense against tumors and a diverse range ofpathogens. Recognition of infection by NK cells is accomplished by the activation of receptors onthe NK cell surface, which initiate NK cell effector functions. Many of the receptors and ligands involved in NK cell antimicrobial ac tivity have been identified, and we are beginning to appreciate how they function during infection. In addi tion, NK cells are activat ed by cytokines (e.g. interleukin12 and type I interf erons), which are products of activated macrophages and dendritic cells. Inresponse to these activating stimuli, NK cells secrete cytokines and chemokines and lyse targetcells. Recent studies have focused on the mechanisms by which NK cells recognize and respond to viruses, parasites and bacteria, and on th e unique role of NK cells in innate immunity to infection. 18 ix. NKT cells REVIEW: Van Kaer. L lymphocytes that r ecognize glycolipid antigens in of the MHC class I-r elated glycoprotein CD1d. Recent studies have identified multiple ways in which NKT cells can become activated during microbial infectio n. Mechanisms of CD1d- restricted antigen presentation ar e being unraveled, and a surprisi ng connection has been made to proteins that control lipid meta bolism and atherosclerosis. It a ppears that several microorganisms have developed strategies to interfere with the CD1d antigen-presentation pathway. New studies have also provided important insight into the mechanisms that control effector cell differentiation of NKT cells and have revealed sp ecialized functions of distinct NKT cell subsets. Finally, there is continued enthusiasm for the development of NKT cell-based therapies of human diseases. x. Platelets REVIEW: von Hundelshausen, P Platelets as Immune Cells Circ Res 2007;100:27 - 40 Beyond an eminent role in hemostasis and thrombosis, platelets are characterized by expert functions in assis ting and modulating inflammatory reactions and immune responses. This is achieved by the regulated expression of adhesive and immune receptors on the platelet surface and by the release of a multitude of secretory products including inflammatory mediators and cytokines, which can mediate the interacti on with leukocytes and enhance their recruitment. In addition, platelets are characterized by an enormous surface area and open canalicular system, which in concert with specialized r ecognition receptors may contribute to the engulfment of serum components, antigens, and pathogens. Platelet-dependent increases in leukocyte adhesion may not only account for an exacerbation of atherosclerosis, for arterial repair processes, but also for lymphocyte trafficking during adaptive immunity and host defense. This review compiles a selection of platelet-derived tools for bridging inflammation and vascular disease and highlights the molecular key components governing platelet-mediated mechanisms operative in immune surveillance, vascular remodeling, and atherosclerosis. REVIEW: Elzey BD, Tian J, Jensen Modulation of Adaptive Immunity. A Communica tion Link between Innate and Adaptive Immune Compartments Immunity 2003;19:9-19 Platelets are highly reactive co mponents of the circulatory system with well-documented hemostatic function. Recent studies extend platelet function to modulation of local inflammatory events through the releas e of chemokines, cytokines, and a number hypothesized that platelet-derived CD154 modulates immunity. The data reported herein demonstrate that plat elets, via CD154, induce de ndritic cell maturation, B cell isotype switching, and augment CD8+ T cell responses both in vitro and in vivo. Platelet 19transfusion studies demonstrate th at platelet-derived CD154 alone is sufficient to induce isotype switching and augm ent T lymphocyte function du ring viral infection, l eading to enhanced protection against viral rechallenge . Additionally, depleti on of platelets in normal mice results in decreased antigen-specific antibody production. xi. Epithelium REVIEW: Schleimer R Epithelium: At the interface of innate and adaptive immune responses J Allergy Clin Immunol 2007;120:1279-84 Several diseases of the airways have a strong com ponent of allergic inflammation in their cause, including allergic rhinitis, asthma, polypoid ch ronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic bronchitis, the roles played by antigens and pathogens vary, these diseases have in common a pathology that includes marked activation of epithelial cells in the upper airways, the lower airways, or both. Substantial new evidence indicates an important role of epithelial cells as both mediators and regulators of innate immune respons es and adaptive immune responses, as well as the transition from innate immunity to adaptive imm unity. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent studies that bear on the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which epithelial cells help to shape the responses of dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells and inflammatory cell recruitment in the context of human disease. Evidence will be discussed that suggests that secreted products of epithelial cells and molecules expressed on their cell surfaces can profoundly influence both immunity and inflammation in the airways. B. Immune Mechanisms 1. Innate versus adaptive immunity REVIEW: Tosi MF Innate Immune Responses to Infection J Allergy Clin Immunol 2005;116:241-9 The human host survives many infectious challeng es in the absence of preexisting specific (adaptive) immunity because ofthe ex istence of a separate set of protective mechanisms that do not depend on specific antigenic recognition. These antig enindependent mechanisms constitute innate immunity. Antimicrobial peptides are released at epithelial surfaces and di srupt the membranes of many microbial and leukoc ytes recognize a range of microbial molecular patterns and generate intra cellular signals for activa tion of a range of host responses. Cytokines released from leukocytes and other cells exhibit a vast array of regulatory functions in both adaptive and i nnate immunity. Chemokines released from infected tissues recruit diverse populations of leukocytes that express distinct chemokine receptors. Natura l killer cells recognize and bind virus-infected host cells and tumor cells and induce their apoptosis. Complement, through the alternative and migrate from the microcirculation into infect ed tissue and ingest and kill invading microbes. These innate immune mechanisms and their interactions in defe nse against infection provi de the host with the time needed to mobilize the more slowly developing mechanisms of adaptive immunity, which might protect against subsequent challenges. 20 LANDMARK PUBLICATION: Krieg AM, Yi A, Matson S et al CpG motifs in bacterial DNA trigger B-cell activation. Nature 1995;374:546-549. Unm ethylated CpG dinucleotides are more frequent in the genomes of bacteria and viruses than of vertebrates. We report here th at bacterial DNA and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides induce murine B cells to proliferate and secrete immunoglobulin in vitro and in vivo. This activ ation is enhanced by simultaneous signals delivered through the antigen receptor. Optimal B-cel l activation requires a DNA motif in which an unmethylated CpG dinucleotide is flanked by two 5' purines and two 3' pyrimidines. Oligodeoxynucleotides containing this CpG motif induce more than 95 percen t of all spleen B cells to enter the cell cycle. These data suggest a possible e volutionary link between immune defence based on the recognition of microbial DNA and the phenomenon of `CpG suppr ession' in vertebrates. The potent immune activation by CpG oligonucleotides has implicati ons for the design and interpretation of studies using `antisense' oligonucleotides and points to possible new applications as adjuvants. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Drenth JPH The Inflammasome - A Linebacker of Innate Defense N Engl J Med 2006;355:730-733 Three articles recently published in Nature now suggest that by discovering cryopyrin, the researchers stumbled on the Rosetta stone of in nateimmunity: a highly conserved and specific response system that detects th e presence of microorganisms. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Schjetne, KW, Thompson KM, Nilsen N, et al. Link between innate and adaptive immunity: Toll-like receptor 2 internalizes antigen for presentation to CD4+ T cells and could be an efficient vaccine target. J Immunology 2003;171:32-36 An ideal vaccine for induction of CD4+ T ce ll responses should i nduce local inflammation, maturation of APC, and peptide lo ading of MHC class II molecules. Ligation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 provides the first two of these three criteria. We have st udied whether targeting of TLR2 results in loading of MHC class II molecules and enhancement of CD4+ T cell responses. To dissociate MHC class II presentati on from APC maturation, we have used an antagonistic, anti-human TLR2 mAb (TL2.1) as ligand and CD4+ T cell clone. TL2.1 mAb was 100-1000 times more efficiently presented compared with isotype-matched control mAb. Moreover, TL2.1 mAb was internalized into endosomes and processed by the conventional MH C class II pathway. This novel function of TLR2 represents a link between innate and adaptiv e immunity and indicates that TLR2 could be a promising target for vaccines. a. Complement and the innate immune response REVIEW: Molina H Complement and immunity 21Rheum Dis Clin North Am. 2004;30:1-18 Our body is in constant interaction with the envi ronment. Som e of the in teractions involve the recognition and disposal of forei gn substances that may harm the delicate balance between health and disease. The foreign elements, or antigen s, include infectious organisms and lifeless macromolecules. The ability of the body to recognize what is dangerous and what is inconsequential, and to refrain from damaging what is perceived as self, are the main functions of the immune system. One important component of the innate immune response is the complement system. This article describes the different mech anisms of how complement is activated and the consequence of this activation, followed by a ch aracterization of the complement's role in inflammation and autoimmunity, and the therapeutic considerations emanating from these studies. REVIEW: Walport MJ. Complement: Parts 1&2. N Eng J Med 2001;344:1058-1066 & 1140-1144. Complement is part of the innate immune system and underlies one of the main effectormechanisms of antibody-mediated im munity. It has three overarching physiologic activities (Table 1): defending ag ainst pyogenic bacterial infecti on, bridging innate and adaptive immunity, and disposing of immune complexes and the products of inflammatory injury. In this review, each of these activities will be placed in a clinical context. Complement was first identified as a heat-labile principle in serum that comple mented\" antibodies in the killing of bacteria. Outline... Complement and the Defense against Infection Pyogenic Infections Complement Deficiency and Neisserial Infections Mannose-Binding Lectin Deficiency Complement and the Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease Abnormalities of Complement Regulation Activation of C3 C3 Nephritic Factors Factor H Deficiency C1 Inhibitor Deficiency Hemoglobinuria REVIEW: Kemper C and Atkinson J. T-cell regulation: with complements from innate immunity. Nature Reviews Immunology 2007;7:9-18. The complement system was traditionally known as an effector arm of humoral immunity. Today we also recognize it as a main element of th e innate immune system. In blood and other body fluids complement is a first line of defense against pathogens, because it becomes fully active within seconds. Active complement fragments attach to the invadi ng pathogen to promote opsonization and lysis, triggering a local infla mmatory response. This review focuses on the evolving role of the complement system in the re gulation of T-cell responses, from directing the initiation phase, through driving lineage comm itment, to regulating the contraction phase. RESEARCH FRONTIER: 22Yalcindag A The complement component C3 plays a critical role in TH1 and TH2 responses to antigen J Allergy Clin mplement component C3 is s by keratinocytes and is activated after skin injury. C3 is also synthesized by pe ritoneal macrophages, which are activated by the adjuvant alum. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the role of C3 in inciting allergic skin Inflammation and systemic immune responses after epicutaneous sensitiza tion or animals epicutaneous sensitiz ation with the antigen ov albumin (OVA) on shaved and tape-stripped skin or in traperitoneal immunization with OVA in alum. RESULTS: Skin Infiltration by eosinophils and expression of mRNA encoding the TH2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 in OVA-sensitized skin sites C3-/- mice. IL-5, and in response to OVA stimulation than splenocytes from WT control animals. The defect in cytokine secretion by splenocytes was also observed after intraperitoneal immunization C3 -/- mice. C3-/- mice had impaired IgG1, IgG2a, and IgE antibody responses after both epicutaneous and intraperitoneal immunization. The defect in cytokine secretion of C3-/- mice was not due to defective prolifera tion to antigen, was not observed after anti-CD3 stimulation, and was co rrected by the addition of purified C3 protein. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that C3 play s an important role in both the TH1 and TH2 response to antigen in vivo. CLINICAL IMPLIC ATIONS: The complement pathway might be a potential target in the therapy of allergic diseases. b. Pattern Recognition Receptors REVIEW: Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R Toll-like receptor control of the adaptive immune responses Nature Immunol. 2004;5:987-95 Recognition of microbial infecti on and initiation of host defense responses is controlled by multiple mechanisms. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) ha ve recently emerged as a key component of the innate immune system that detect microbial infection and trigger antimicrobial host defense responses. TLRs activate multiple steps in the infl ammatory reactions that help to eliminate the invading pathogens and coordinate systemic defenses. In additi on, TLRs control multiple dendritic cell functions and activate signals th at are critically involved in th e initiation of adaptive immune responses. Recent studies have provided important clues about the mechanisms of TLR-mediated control of adaptive immunity orch estrated by dendritic cell populations in distinct anatomical locations. REVIEW: Kaisho T and Akiro S. Toll-like receptor function and J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006; 117:979-987. Mammals sense pathogen invasion through pa receptors. A group of transmembrane proteins, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), play critic al roles as pattern-recognition receptors. They are mainly expressed on antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages or dendritic cells, and their signali ng activates antigen-presenting cell s to provoke innate immunity and to establish adaptive immunit y. Each TLR has common effects, such as inflammatory cytokine 23induction or upregulation of costim ulatory molecule expression, but al so has its specific function, exemplified by type I IFN-inducing ability. These im munoadjuvant effects are not only critical in antimicrobial immunity but are al so involved in manifestations of autoimmunity. Furthermore, some TLR agonists are now promising therapeutic tools for various immune disorders, including allergy. Therefore understanding molecular mechan isms on TLRs should be quite useful in the development of therapeutic maneuvers ag ainst allergy and autoimmune diseases. REVIEW: Gearing A. Targeting toll-like receptors for drug deve lopment: a summary of commercial approaches. Immunol Cell Biol 2007;85:490-94. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are essential mediat ors of both innate a nd adaptive immunity by recognizing and eliciting responses upon invasion of pathogens. The response of TLRs must be stringently regulated as exaggerated expression of signalli ng components as well as pro- inflammatory cytokines can have devastating effects on the host, re sulting in chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders and aid in the pathogenesis of TLR-associated human diseases. Therefore, it is essential that negative regulator s act at multiple levels within TLR signalling cascades, as well as through elicit ing negative-feedback mechanisms in order to synchronize the positive activation and negative regulation of signal transduction to avert potentially harmful immunological consequences. This review explores the various mechanisms employed by negative regulators to ensure the appropriate modulation of both immune and inflammatory responses. REVIEW: Lang T and Mansell A.

Odemuyiwa SO. Moqbel R Understanding exocytosis in immune and in flammatory cells: the molecular basis of mediator secretion J Allergy Clin Immunol 2003;111:923-32 Inflammatory cells secrete proteins from intracellul ar vesicles or granules by a process referred to either as exocytosis or as degranulation, which is common to all cell types. Exocytosis is a precise term that describes the process of granule or vesicular fusion with the plasma membrane and is accompanied by release of granule/vesicle contents to the cell exterior. This process is of particular significance with respect to tissue damage and remodeling in inflammatory diseases, inasmuch as these changes are the consequen ces of inflammatory cell activa tion and mediator elaboration. Despite its unifying importance to all inflammato ry cell types, little is known about the precise molecular and intracellular mechanisms that regul ate mobilization of secretory granules/vesicles and, ultimately, secretion of medi ators from immune and inflammato ry cells. This article reviews the mechanisms and molecules currently implicated at distal stages of ex ocytosis from eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells, platelets, and macr ophages. Conserved molecules identified among inflammatory cell types indicate a convergence of pathways leading to mediator secretion. The identification of essential molecules in the cascade of events leading to exocytosis is critical in the search for novel therapeutic targets aimed at modu lating mediator secretion from these cell types. REVIEW: Radek K Antimicrobial peptides: natural effectors of the innate immune system. Sem 2007;29:27-43 Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an evolutiona rily conserved component of the innate immune system that defend against invadi ng bacteria, viruses, and fungi through membrane or metabolic disruption. The efficiency of host defense via AMPs derives from the ability of these peptides to quickly identify and eradicate foreign pathogens through precise biochemical mechanisms. Recent advances in this field have expanded the repertoire of activities for AMPs to include 25immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory capacity as a catalyst for secondary host defense m echanisms. Further scrutiny of the biochemical a nd regulatory mechanisms of AMPs will lead to novel alternative approaches to the treatment of hu man pathogenic disorders. LANDMARK PUBLICATION: Ong P Endogenous Antimicrobial Peptides and Sk in Infections in Atopic Dermatitis N Engl J Med 2002; 347:1151-1160 Background The innate immune system of hu man skin contains antimicrobial peptides known as cathelicidins (LL-37) and -defensins. In normal skin these peptides are negligible, but they accumulate in skin affected by inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis. We compared the levels of expression of LL-37 and human -defensin 2 (HBD-2) in inflamed skin from patients with atopic dermatitis and from those with psoriasis. Methods The expression of LL-37 and HBD-2 protein in skin-biopsy specimens from patients with ps oriasis, patients with atopic dermatitis, and normal subjects was determined by immunohistochemical analysis. The amount of antimicrobial peptides in extracts of skin samples was also analyzed by immunodot blot analysis (for LL-37) and Western blot analysis (for HBD-2). Quantitative, real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays were used to confirm the relative expression of HBD-2 and LL-37 messenger RNA (mRNA) in the skin-biopsy specimens. These peptides were also tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus with the use of a colony-forming assay. Results Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of abundant LL-37 and HBD-2 in the superficial epidermis of all patients with psoriasis. In comparison, immunostaining for these peptides was significantly decreased in acute and chronic lesions from patients with atopic dermatitis (P=0.006 and P=0.03, respectively). These results we re confirmed by immunodot blot and Western blot analyses. Real -time RT-PCR showed significantly lower expression of HBD-2 mRNA and mRNA in atopic lesions than in lesions (P=0.009 and P=0.02, respectively). The combination of LL-37 and HBD-2 showed synergistic antimicrobial activity by effectively killing S. aureus . Conclusions A deficiency in the expression of antimicrobial peptides may account for the susceptibility of patients with atopic dermatitis to skin infection with S. aureus . 2. Major histocompatibility complex - molecular structure and function REVIEW: Al-Daccak R, Mooney N, Charron D. MHC class antigen presenting cells. Curr Opin Immunol 2004;16:108-113 The MHC class II molecules have been recognized as signaling receptors for more than a decade, and recent work has revealed the importance of their signaling for the immune response. Today, we know that the function of MHC class II molecules on antigen presenting cells (APCs) is not limited to their role as antigen-presenting structures ; they are flexible receptors that, by triggering a variety of signaling pathways, can regulate APC activities from proliferation and maturation to apoptosis. Recent advances have provided insights into how these molecules might accommodate such regulation. REVIEW: Thorsby E 26MHC Structure and Function. Transplant Proc 1999: 31:713-716 It was Peter A. Gorer who in 1937 was the first to demonstrate a histocompatibility antigen, [ 1] which led to the discovery of the H-2 com plex of histocompatibility antigens in mice. Later a similar complex was found in man, called HLA (first defined on human leukocytes, hence the name human leukocyte antigens), an d in many other animals. Togeth er they are called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) because the corresponding antigens are major histocompatibility antigens (ie, they induce strong alloimmune responses and are mainly responsible for rejection of allogr afts). It became quickly accepted that the MHC antigens were not created to embarrass transplantation surgeons. Their biological function remained, however, an enigma until the early 1970s, wh en their important role in an tigen recognition by T cells was discovered, particularly through the wo rk of Doherty and Zinkernagel.[ 2] When the peptide- binding cleft of MHC molecules was first visualized a little more than 10 years ago, [ 3] their immunobiological role as informers for T cells was fully revealed. A short summary of our present knowledge of the structure and function of the pe ptidepresenting (\"classi cal\") MHC molecules is given here. No attempt will be made to cover the vast amount of literature in this area. 3. Immunogenetics - Gene rearrangements in the generation of immune system diversity REVIEW: Rooney S The role of the non-homologous end-join ing pathway in lymphocyte development Immunol Rev 2004;200:115-131 One of the most toxic insults a cell can incur is a di sruption of its linear DNA in the form of a double-strand break (DSB). Left unrepaired, or repair ed improperly, these lesions can result in cell death or neoplastic transformation. Despite these dangers, lymphoid cells purposely introduce DSBs into their genome to maximize the diversity and effector functions of their antigen receptor genes. While the generation of breaks requires dis tinct lymphoid-specific f actors, their resolution requires various ubiquitously expressed DNA-re pair proteins, known co llectively as the non- homologous end-joining pathway. In this review, we discuss the factors that constitute this pathway as well as the evidence of thei r involvement in two lymphoid-specific DNA recombination events. REVIEW: S Regulation of V(D)J recombination Curr Opin Immunol 2006;18:158-163 Adaptive immunity is intimately linked to the expression of antigen-specific immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes and their recombination asse mbly from germline V, D and J gene segments. This developmentally regulated process relies on the activity of the Rag1-Rag2 recombinase, on accessibility of target gene segments and on mono allelic gene activation. Recent studies have revealed new mechanisms that, along with recomb inase activity and locus accessibility, are likely to contribute to the control of V(D)J recombinati on, including target-site bi as by the recombinase, RNA processing and chromosome positioning. REVIEW: 27Nossal GJ, The Double helix and Immunology. Nature 2003;421:440-4 The immune system can recognize and produce an tibodies to virtually any m olecule in the Universe. This enormous diversity arises from the ingenious reshuffling of DNA sequences encoding components of the immune system. Imm unology is an example of a field completely transformed during the past 50 ye ars by the discovery of the stru cture of DNA and the emergence of DNA technologies that followed.

Antigen-presenting cells - processing and presentation of conventional and superantigens REVIEW: Sundberg EJ TCR recognition complex (MHC) class II mol ecules display peptides to the T cell receptor (TCR). The ability of the TCR to discriminate foreign from self-peptides presented by MHC molecules is a requirement of an effective ad aptive immune response. Dysregulation of this molecular recognition event often leads to a disease state. Recently, a number of structural studies have provided significant insight into several such dysregulated interacti ons between peptide/MHC complexes and TCR molecules. These include TCR recognition of self-peptides, which results in autoimmune reactions, and of muta nt self-peptides, common in th e immunosurveillance of tumors, as well as the engagement of TCRs by superantigens, a family of bacterial toxins responsible for toxic shock syndrome. REVIEW: Rossi, M Human dendritic cells: potent antigen-presenti ng cells at the crossroads of innate and adaptive immunity. J Immunol 2005;175:1373-81 Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized, bone marrow- derived leukocytes that are critical to the development of immunity. Investigators have empha sized the role of DCs in initiating adaptive or acquired MHC-restricted, Ag-specific T cell res ponses. More recent evidence supports important roles for DCs in the onset of innate immunity a nd peripheral tolerance. Pr ogress in the generation of DCs from defined hemopoietic precursors in vitro has revealed the heterogeneity of these APCs and their attendant divisions of labor. This review will address these developments in an attempt to integrate the activities of different DCs in coordinating innate and adaptive immunity. REVIEW: Petersson K, G, by simultaneously binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II on an tigen-presenting cells and T-cell receptors (TCRs) on T cells. Despite a common overall three-dimensional fold of these SAGs, they have been shown to bind to MHC class II in different ways. Recently, it has also been shown that SAGs have individual preferences in th eir binding to the TCRs. They can in teract with various regions of the variable \u00df-chain of TCRs and at least one SA G seems to bind to the a-chain of TCRs. In this review, different subclasses of SAGs are classified based upon their binding mode to MHC class II, and models of trimolecular complexes of MH C-SAG-TCR molecules are described in order to reveal and understand the complexity of SAG-mediated T-cell activation. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Llewelyn M HLA class II polymorphisms determine responses to bacterial superantigens. J Immunol. 2004;172:1719-26. The excessive immunological response triggered by microbial superantigens has been implicated in the etiology of a wide range of human diseases but has been most clearly defined for the staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock syndromes. Because MHC class II presentation of superantigens to T cells is not MHC-restricte d, the possibility that HLA polymorphisms could influence superantigenicity, and thus clinical susceptibility to the toxicity of individual superantigens, has received li ttle attention. In this study, we demonstrate that binding of streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens to HLA class II is influenced by allelic differences in class II. For the superantigen streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A, class II binding is dependent on DQ alpha-chain polymorphisms such that HLA-DQA1*01 alpha-chains show greater binding than DQA1*03/05 alpha-chains. The functional imp lications of differential binding on T cell activation were investigated in various experimental systems using human T cells and murine Vbeta8.2 transgenic cells as responders. Thes e studies showed quantitative and qualitative differences resulting from differential HL A-DQ binding. We observed changes in T cell proliferation and cytokine producti on, and in the Vbeta specific ch anges in T cell re pertoire that have hitherto been regarded as a defining feature of an individual superantigen. Our observations reveal a mechanism for the different outcomes s een following infection by toxigenic bacteria. 5.

J Immunol 1923;8:163-182 RESEARCH FRONTIER: van Wijk F, Hoeks, Nierkens S 29CTLA-4 Signaling Regulates the Intensity of Hypersensitivity Respo nses to Food Antigens, but is Not Decisive in the Induction of Sensitization J Immunol 2005;174:174-179 Although food allergy has emerged as a major health problem, the mechanisms that are decisive in the development of sensitization to dietar y Ag remain largely unknown. CTLA-4 signaling negatively regulates immune activation, and may play a crucial role in pr eventing induction and/or progression of sensitization to food Ag. To elucidate the role of CT LA-4 signaling in responses to food allergens, a murine model of peanut allergy was used. During oral exposure to peanut protein extract (PPE) together with the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin (CT), which induces peanut allergy, CTLA-4 ligation was prevented using a CTLA-4 mAb. Additiona lly, the effect of inhibition of the CTLA-4 pathway on oral exposure to PPE in the absence of CT, which leads to unresponsiveness to peanut Ag, was explored. During sensitization, an ti-CTLA-4 treatment considerably enhanced IgE responses to PPE and the peanut allergens, Ara h 1, Ara h 3, and Ara h 6, resulting in elevated mast cell degranulation upon an oral challenge. Remarkably, antagonizing CTLA-4 during exposure to PPE in the absence of CT resulted in significant induction of Th2 cytokines and an elevation in to tal serum IgE levels, but failed to induce allergen-specific IgE responses and mast cell degranulation upon a PPE ch allenge. These results i ndicate that CTLA-4 signaling is not the crucial factor in preventing sensitization to f ood allergens, but plays a pivotal role in regulating the intensity of a food allergic sensitization re sponse. Furthermore, these data indicate that a profoundly Th2-biased cytokine environment is insuffici ent to induce allergic responses against dietary Ag. a. Type I -Immediate Hypersensitivity Response REVIEW: Platts-Mills TA The role of immunoglobulin E in allergy and asthma Am J of Respir Crit Care Med;2001 164:S1-5 Abstract: It has been nearly a ce ntury since the first suggestion that a soluble factor in plasma or serum might be responsible for th e symptoms of allergic disease and asthma, and more than 30 yr since immunoglobulin E (IgE) was id entified as the key molecule in mediating what are now described as type 1 hypersensitivity reactions (allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, some forms of drug allergy, and insect sting allergy). Since that time, many of the details of the inflammatory cascade underlying allergy and asthma have been elucidated, and IgE is now known to play a key upstream role. The goals of this report ar e to review the cellular and molecular events set in motion by IgE and to examine the evidence for its participation in both the immedi ate allergic response and the late-phase or chronic inflammatory response in the skin and lungs. i. IgE binding and signal transduction REVIEW: Siraganian RP Mast cell signal transduction receptor Cur Opin Immunol ;2003:15:639-46 Antigen-mediated aggregation of IgE bound to its high- affinity receptor on ma st cells or basophils initiates a complex series of bioc hemical events, resulting in the release of mediators that cause allergic inflammation and ana phylactic reactions. Recent progre ss has defined the molecular 30pathways that are involved in stimulating thes e cells and has shown th e importance of protein tyrosine kinases in the subseque nt re actions. The activation pathways are regulated both positively and negatively by the interactions of numerous signaling molecules. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Cendron AC An FcgammaRIIa-binding peptide that Immunol. 2008;45:307-19 A disulphide-constrained peptide the low affinity Fc receptor, FcgammaRIIa (CD32) has been identified and its stru cture solved by NMR. Linear (7 -m disulphide- constrained (7-mer) phage display peptide lib raries were panned on recombinant soluble FcgammaRIIa genetically fused to HSA (HSA-Fcgam maRIIa). Peptides were isolated only from the constrained peptide library and these contained the consen sus sequence, CWPGWxxC. Phage clones displaying variants of the peptide co nsensus sequence bound to FcgammaRIIa and the strongest binding clone C7C1 (C WPGWDLNC) competed with IgG for binding to FcgammaRIIa and was inhibited from binding to FcgammaR IIa by the FcgammaRIIa-blocking antibody, IV.3, suggesting that C7C1 and IgG share relate d binding sites on FcgammaRIIa. A synthetic disulphide-constrained peptide, pep-C7C1 bound to FcgammaRIIa by biosensor analysis, albeit with low affinity (K(D) approximately 100muM). It was significant that the FcgammaRIIa consensus peptide sequence contained a Proline (Pro(3)), which when substituted with alanine abrogated FcgammaRIIa binding, consistent with Pro(3) contributing to receptor binding. Upon binding of IgG and IgE to their respective Fc receptors (FcgammaRs and FcvarepsilonRI) Pro(329) in the Fc makes a critic al interaction with two highly c onserved Trp residues (Trp(90) and Trp(113)) of the FcRs. The NMR structure of pep-C7C1 revealed a st abilizing type II beta- turn between Trp(2) and Trp(5), with Pro(3) solvent exposed. Modelling of the pep-C7C1 structure in complex with FcgammaRIIa suggests that Pro( 3) of C7C1 binds to FcgammaRIIa by inserting between Trp(90) and Trp(113) of FcgammaRIIa thereby mimicking the molecular interaction made between FcgammaRIIa and IgG. ii. Preformed and newly synthesized mediator release REVIEW: Marone G. Casolaro V. Patella V, et al. Molecular and cellular biology of mast cells and basophils. Int Arch Allergy Immunol;1997 114:207-17 In all mammalian species investigated so far, mast cells and basophils are the only cells that synthesize histamine and express plasma membrane receptors that bind IgE with high affinity (Fc epsilonRI). Human basophils and mast cells derive from distinct precursors that originate in the bone marrow and fetal liver and probably circul ate in peripheral bl ood. There is extensive evidence that mast cells and basophils and thei r mediators are primary effectors of allergic inflammation. Immunologically activated human basoph ils release two cytokines: IL-4 and IL-13. Expression of several cytokines has been documented in a number of experimental models of human and rodent mast cells. However, to date fe w studies have analyzed the mechanisms of gene expression in human Fc epsilonRI+ cells. Some of these studies imply a role for NFAT and GATA family members in the IgE-mediated activation of cytokine gene transcription in basophils and 31mast cells. S tudies of human basophils and mast cells isolated from different anatomic sites have established the different prof iles of eicosanoids released by these cells . Recently, the characterization of arachidonic ac id pools and the identificatio n of novel enzymes involved in arachidonate remodeling and mobilization clarified in part how eicosanoid productions is regulated in mast cells and basophils. In addition to hist amine, human mast cell secretory granules contain the neutral proteases tryptase, chymase and car boxypeptidase that possess several biochemical properties. In particular, tryptase may play a role as a fibrogenic factor and chymase might convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Mast cells are present in human heart and in human coronary arteries raising the possibility that local activatio n of cardiac mast cells might contribute to certain cardiovascular diseases. Recent evidence also sugge sts that mast cells and basophils can play a role during viral and bacteria l infections. It is now evident that in man these two cells not only participate in inflammation associated with allergic disease, but also in chronic and fibrotic disorders affecting several organs and in host defense against bacter ial and viral infections. iii. late phase reactions REVIEW: O'Byrne P Asthma pathogenesis and allergen-induced late responses J Allergy Clin Immunol 1998;102:S85-S90 Increases in airway eosinophils occur during the late asthmatic response, 7 hours after allergen inhalation, and these can persist for 3 days. Also, increases in airway metachromatic cells occur which are most marked after 7 hours. These increase s in airway cells are associated with increases in bone marrow progenitors, which are caused by an increased responsiveness of the bone marrow to IL-5 after allergen because of an increased expression of the IL-5 receptor on the progenitors. These studies suggest that after allergen inhalation, signa ls are sent from the airways to the bone marrow, which increase production of progenitors a nd make more cells available to be recruited into the airways. b.

Gessner JE On the role of complement and Fc ga mma-receptors in the Arthus reaction. Molecular Immunology. 1999;36:893-903 The contribution of either the complement system or the activation of Fc receptors for IgG (FcyRs) to the inflammatory response in immune complex (IC ) disease is puzzling. A series of studies has been performed in mice with engineered defici encies of either FcgammaRs, the complement 32components C3, C4 or the C5a receptor. In addition, different C5-deficien t mice strains have been evaluated. Mice with gene targ eted disruption of the gamma-subunit, which mediates surface expression and signal transduction of the high affinity Fc receptor type I for IgG (FcgammaRI), the low affinity receptor Fc receptor type III for IgG (FcgammaRIII) and the high affinity receptor type I for IgE (IgepsilonRI), showed an impaired inflammatory response in the reverse passive Arthus reaction in skin, peritoneum and lung. These data suggest, that the activation of FgammaRs is the initial event tri ggering the inflammatory cascade in IC disease. On the other hand, C5aR deficient mice are either protecte d from tissue injury induced by ICs, as in the lung, or the degree of the inflammatory response is markedly attenu ated, as in peritoneum and skin. A detailed analysis of data obtained with th e different knock-out strains rev ealed that both the activation of the complement system as well as the activatio n of different effector cells via FcgammaRs contribute to the inflammatory sequelae leading to tissue destruction in IC disease. The relative contributions of FcgammaRI or FcgammaRIII and the main effector cells through which these receptors mediate their effector functions are tissue dependent. Th e activation of the C5a receptor pathway appears to be the prominent contribution of the complement system. d. Type IV - Cell mediated /Del ayed Hypersensitivity Response developm ent and regulation of TH cell -mediated immune responses of the skin J Invest Derm 2004;9:5-14. Since the first description of the subpopulations of TH1 and TH2 cells, insights into the development and control of these cells as two polar ized and physiologically balanced subsets have been generated. In particular, implications of the TH1-TH2 concept for TH cell-mediated skin disorders have been discovered. This article wi ll review the basic factors that control the development of TH1 and TH2 cells, such as the cyt okines IL-12 and IL-4 and transcription factors, the possible role of costimulatory molecules, and specialized dendritic cell populations. These regulatory mechanisms will be discussed in the context of polarized TH1 or TH2 skin disorders such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Also presented are the principles that govern how chemokines and chemokine receptors recruit TH1 and TH2 cells to inflammatory sites and how they amplify these polarized TH cell responses. All of these con cepts, including a novel role for IL-4-inducing TH1 responses, can contribute to the design of better therapeutic strategies to modulate TH cell-mediated immune responses. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Watanabe H Activation of the IL-1beta-proc essing inflammasome is involved in contact hypersensitivity. J Invest Dermatol. 2007;127:1956-63. The inflammasome is a cytosolic protein complex regulating of which cleaves the pro-in flammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18 into their form. is composed of a NACHT-, LRR- and pyrin (NALP) family member that acts as a sensor fo r danger signals and the ad aptor protein apoptosis- associated speck-like protein containing a CARD do main (ASC), which allows the recruitment of caspase-1 in the complex. In the skin, exposure to contact sensitizers (CS) such as trinitro-chlorobenzene causes an immune response called contact hypersensitivity (CHS) or eczema. In this delayed-type hypersensitivity response, effici ent priming of the adaptive immunity depends on 33the concomitant activation of the innate immune system , including IL-1beta /IL-18 activation in the skin. To determine if the inflammasome contributes to CHS, we have analyzed its capacity to react to CS in vitro and in vivo. We show here that key components of the inflammasome are present in human keratinocytes and that CS like trinitro-c hlorobenzene induce caspase-1/ASC dependent IL- 1beta and IL-18 processing and secretion. We also show that AS C- and NALP3-deficient mice display an impaired response to CS. These findings suggest that CS act as danger signals that activate the inflammasome in the skin, and reveal a new role of NALP3 and ASC as regulators of innate immunity in CHS. 6. T cell mediated immunity REVIEW: Jiang H Regulation of Immune Responses by T Cells N Engl J Med 2006;354:1166-76 The T-cell branch of the immune system can respond to a virtually infinite variety of antigens, in part because it includes a very large repertoire of T-cell clones, each with a unique receptor for antigen. It is inevitable that this diverse repertoire contains T cells with receptors that can recognize the body's own antigens \u2014 self-reactive T cells \u2014 and instigate harmful autoimmunity. For this reason, a means of restraining such T cells is essential. The controls depend on two mechanisms that not only avert autoimmunity but al so maintain protective immunity: shaping of the T-cell repertoire in the thymus and regulation of T cells in the periphery. a. T cell activation - T ce ll receptor structure and func tion, epitope recognition and accessory molecules in signal transduction REVIEW: Rudolph MG How TCRs bind MHCs, peptides, and coreceptors Ann Rev Immunol 2006;24:419-66 Since the first crystal structure determinations of alphabeta T cell receptors (TCRs) bound to class I MHC-peptide (pMHC) antigens in 1996, a sizable database of 24 class I and class II TCR/pMHC complexes has been accumulated that now defines a substantial degree of structural variability in TCR/pMHC recognition. Recent determination of free and bound gammadelta TCR structures has enabled comparisons of the modes of antigen recognition by alphabeta and gammadelta T cells and antibodies. Crystal structures of TCR accessory (CD4, CD8) and coreceptor molecules (CD3epsilondelta, CD3epsilongamma) have further a dvanced our structural understanding of most of the components that constitute the TCR signaling complex. Despite all these efforts, the structural basis for MHC restric tion and signaling remains elusive as no structural features that define a common binding mode or signaling mechanism have yet been gleaned from the current set of TCR/pMHC complexes. Notwithstanding, the impressive array of self, foreign (microbial), and autoimmune TCR complexes have uncovered the diverse ways in which antigens can be specifically recognized by TCRs. REVIEW: Kuhns MS Deconstructing the form and function of the TCR/CD3 complex. Immunity. 2006;24:133-9 34When T cells encounter antigens via the T cell antigen recep tor (TCR), information about the quantity and quality of antigen engagement is relayed to the intracellular signal transduction machinery. This process is poorly understood. The TCR itself lacks a sign ificant intracellular domain. Instead, it is associated with CD3 molecules that contain intracellular signaling domains that couple the TCR/CD3 complex to the downstr eam signaling machinery. Th e earliest events in TCR signaling must involve the transfer of info rmation from the antigen binding TCR subunit to the CD3 signaling subunits of the TCR/CD3 comple x. Elucidating the struct ural organization of the TCR with the associated CD3 signaling molecules is necessary for understanding the mechanism by which TCR engagement is coupled to activation. Here, we re view the current state of our understanding of the structure a nd organization of the TCR/CD3 complex. REVIEW: Choudhuri K. Molecular mechanisms involved in T cell receptor triggering. Semin Immunol. 2007 Aug;19:255-61 Despite intensive inve stigation we still do not understand how the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) tranduces signals across the plasma membrane, a process referred to as TCR triggering. Three basic mechanisms have been proposed, involving aggregation, confor mational change, or segregation of the TCR upon binding pMHC liga nd. Given the low density of pMHC ligand it remains doubtful that TCR aggregation initiate s triggering, although it is likely to enhance subsequent signalling. Structural studies to date have not provided definitive evidence for or against a conformational change mechanism, but they have ruled out certain types of conformational change. Size-induc ed segregation of the bound TCR from inhibitory membrane tyrosine phosphatases seems to be required, but is probably not the only mechanism. Current evidence suggests that TCR triggering is in itiated by a combination of segregation and conformational change, with subseq uent aggregation contributing to amplification signal. responses to allergens J Allergy Clin Immunol 2007.119:280-294 This article highlights recent advances in the ch aracterization of allergen-specific memory TH2 cells and discusses the heterogeneous nature of regulatory T cells and possible mechanisms of action.

Recently, a number of structural studies have provided significant insight into several such dysregulated interactions between peptide/MHC complexes and TCR molecules. These include TCR recognition of self-peptides, which results in autoimmune reactions, and of muta nt self-peptides, common in th e immunosurveillance of tumors, as well as the engagement of TCRs by superantigens, a family of bacterial toxins responsible for toxic shock syndrome. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Wells JW Regulation of allergic airway inflammation by class I-restricted allergen presentation and CD8 T-cell infiltration. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2007; 119:226-34 This study explores the dynamics, nature, and imm unoregulatory activities of the class I CD8 T- cell response to inhaled allergen using a murine model of respiratory allergen sensitization, adoptive transfer of transgenic T ce lls, and flow cytometric analysis of lung infiltrates. The data suggest that CD8 cells specific for inhaled allergens are generated in draining lymph nodes but suppress allergic airway inflammation through induction of IL-12 in the lung during interaction with respiratory dendritic cells.

RESEARCH FRONTIER: TH17 cells in the big Allergy Clin Immu nol 2007; 120; 247-254 The pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseas es is assumed to depend on activated T cells interacting with resident tissue cells or migratory inflammatory cells. The discovery of new T-cell subsets such as th e IL-17-producing T H17 and T-regulatory cells i nnovated our understanding of T-cell biology. Studies on new subsets confirm the im portant role of T cells in the instruction of tissue cells and also demonstrate the important role of feedback regulation for the polarization toward distinct T-cell subsets. The understanding of IL-17 and T H17 differentiation pathways has also changed the perspective of immunologists re garding the basis of ch ronic tissue inflammation, particularly where T H1 cells were considered as driving force of the pathology.

Two types of murine helper T cell clone. II. Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity is Mediated by TH1 Clones. J Immunology 1987;138:3688-94. We have previously shown that at least two types of Lyt-1+, Lyt-2-, L3T4+ helper T cell clones can be distinguished in vitro by different patter ns of lymphokine secreti on and by different forms of B cell help. Evidence is presen ted here to show that one type of helper T cell clone (TH1) causes delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) when injected with the appropriate antigen into the 37footpads of naive mice. The antigen -specific, ma jor histocompatability complex (MHC)-restricted footpad swelling reaction peaked at approximately 24 hr. Foot pad swelling was induced by all TH1 clones tested so far, includi ng clones specific for soluble, partic ulate, or allogeneic antigens. In contrast, local transfer of TH2 cells and antigen did not produce a DTH reaction, even when supplemented with syngeneic spleen accessory cells . Similarly, local transf er of an alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte clone into appropriate recipients did not produce DTH. The requirements for the DTH reaction induced by TH1 cells were i nvestigated further by using TH1 clones with dual specificity for both forei gn antigens and M1s antigens. Although these clones responded in vitro to either antigen + syngeneic presenting ce lls, or M1s disparate spleen cells, they responded in vivo only to antigen + MHC and did not cause footpad swelling in an M1s-disparate mouse in the absence of antigen. Moreover, in vitro preac tivation of TH1 or TH2 cells with the lectin concanavalin A was insufficient to induce DTH reac tions upon subsequent in jection into footpads. From these results, we conclude that the lack of DTH given by TH2 clones in vivo could be due to the inability of the TH2 cells to produce the correct mediators of DTH, or to a lack of stimulation of TH2 clones in the footpad environment.

Further Differences in Lymphokine Synthesis between Th1 and Th2 Clones Revealed by RNA Hybridization, Functionally and Monoclonal Antibodies. J Exp Med 1987;166:1229-44. Lymphokine synthesis patterns of a panel of 19 T cell clones have been evaluated, using mRNA hybridization methods to examine 11 different mR NAs induced by Con A. The two types of CD4+ Th cell clone described previous ly were clearly distinguishe d by this procedure, and the differences between the two types have now been extended to six induced products. With minor exceptions, only Th1 clones synthesized mRNA fo r IL-2, IFN-gamma, and lymphotoxin, and only Th2 clones synthesized mRNA for IL-4, IL-5, and another induced gene, P600. Four more induced products were expressed preferentially but not un iquely by one or another type of clone: mRNAs for GMCSF, TNF, and another i nduced, secreted product (TY5) were produced in larger amounts by Th1 clones, whereas preproenkephalin was pref erentially expressed by Th2 clones. IL-3 was produced in similar amounts by both types of clone. mAbs were used to establish three bioassays that were functionally monospecific for IL-2, IL-3, and IL-4, and a new anti-IFN gamma mAb, XMG1.2, was used to establish an ELISA for IFN- gamma. These four assays were used to show that secreted protein and mRNA levels correlated well for all cell lines. The implications of these findings for normal T cells are discussed.

J Exp Med 1989;170:2081-95. A cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor (CSIF) is secreted by T h2 clones in response to Con A or antigen stimulation, but is absent in supernat ants from Con A-induced Th1 clones. CSIF can inhibit the production Th2 cytokine 38synthesis is not significantly aff ected. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) also inhibits IFN-gamma production, although less effectively than CSIF, whereas IL-2 and IL-4 partially antagonize the activity of CSIF. CSIF inhibition of cytokine synthesi s is not complete, since early cytokine synthesis (before 8 h) is not significantly a ffected, whereas later synthesis is strongly inhibited. In the presence of CSIF, IFN-gamma mRNA levels are reduced slightly at 8, and strongly at 12 h after stimulation. Inhibition of cytokine expression by CSIF is not due to a general reduction in Th1 cell viability, si nce actin mRNA levels were not reduced, and proliferation of antigen-stimulated cells in response to IL-2, wa s unaffected. Biochemical characterization, mAbs, and recombinant or purified cytokines showed that CS IF is distinct from IL-1, CSIF in crossregulation of Th1 and Th2 responses is discussed.

T cell subsets REVIEW: Jiang H An integrated view of suppressor T cell subsets in immunoregulation J Clin Invest 2004;114:1198-208 The immune system evolved to protect organisms from a virtually infinite variety of disease- causing agents but to avoid harmful responses to self. Because immune protective mechanisms include the elaboration of potent inflammatory molecules, antibodies, and killer cell activation-- 39which together can not only destroy invading m icroorganisms, pathogenic autoreactive cells, and tumors, but also mortally injure normal cells--th e immune system is inherently a \"double-edged sword\" and must be tightly regulated. Imm une response regulation includes homeostatic mechanisms intrinsic to the activation and diffe rentiation of antigen-triggered immunocompetent cells and extrinsic mechanisms mediated by suppr essor cells. This review series will focus on recent advances indicating that distinct subsets of regulatory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as NK T cells control the outgrowth of potentially pathogenic antigen-reactive T cells and will highlight the evidence that these suppressor T cells may play potentially impor tant clinical roles in preventing and treating immune-med iated disease. Here we provi de a historical overview of suppressor cells and the experimental basis for the existence of functi onally and phenotypically distinct suppressor subsets. Finally, we will spec ulate on how the distinct suppressor cell subsets may function in concert to regulate immune responses. REVIEW: Stockinger B. Differentiation and function of Th17 T cells. Current Opinion in Immunology2007;19:281-6. IL-17-producing T cells have recent ly been classified as a new e ffector T-cell subset, termed Th17, which is distinct from Th1, and Treg subsets. There has been much pr ogress in the past year, leading to identification of the molecular mechanisms that drive differentiation of Th17 T cells. This has helped to clarify many aspects of their role in host de fense as well as in autoimmunity. Nevertheless, many intriguing questions remain to be answered regarding the regulation of Th17- mediated responses as well as their interactions w ith the other T-cell subsets. Furthermore, the role of pathogens and pathogen-derived molecules in influencing effect or T-cell polarization needs to be re-evaluated in the light of the differentia tion conditions that favor Th17 T-cell responses.

RESEARCH FRONTIER: Watanabe N. Hassall's Corpuscles instruct dendritic cells to induce human thymus Nature 2005;436:1181-85 Hassall's corpuscles-first desc ribed in the human thymus ove r 150 years ago-are groups of epithelial cells within the thymic medulla. The physical nature of these structures differs between mammalian species. Although Hassall's corpuscles have been proposed to act in both the removal of apoptotic thymocytes and the maturation of developing thymocytes within the thymus, the function of Hassall's corpuscles has remained an enigma. Here we report that of CD80 and CD86. These TSLP-conditioned dendritic cells ar able to induce the prolifer ation and differentiation of CD4(+)CD8(-)CD25(-) thymic T cells into CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) (forkhead box P3) regulatory T cells. This induction depends on peptide-major histocompatibil ity complex class II interactions, and the presence of CD80 and CD86, as well as interleuki n 2. Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that CD25(+)CTLA4(+) (cytotoxic T-lym phocyte-associated protein 4) re gulatory T cells associate in the thymic medulla with activated or mature dendritic cells and TSLP-expressing Hassall's corpuscles. These findings suggest th at Hassall's corpuscles have a critical role in dendritic-cell- mediated secondary positive selectio n of medium-to-high affinity se lf-reactive T cells, leading to the generation of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells within the thymus. REVIEW: Akdis M, Blaser K, Akdis CA T regulatory cells in allergy: Novel concepts in the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of allergic diseases. 41J Allergy Clin Immunol 2005;116: 949-959 The identification of T regulatory (TReg) cells as key regulators of immunologic processes in peripheral to lerance to allergens has opened an important era in the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases. Both naturally occurring CD4+ CD25+ TReg cells and i nducible populations of allergen-specific IL-10-secreting TR1 cells inhibit allergenspecific effector cells in experimental models. Allergen-specific TReg cell responses contribute to the control of allergic inflammation in several ways. Skewing of allergenspecific effector T cells to a TReg phenotype appears to be a crucial event in the developmen t of a healthy immune response to allergens and successful outcome in allergen-specific immunothera py. The increased levels of IL-10 and TGF- produced by TReg cells can potently suppress IgE pr oduction while simultaneously increasing the production of the noninflammatory antibody isotype s IgG4 and IgA, respectively. TReg cells directly or indirectly suppress e ffector cells of allerg ic inflammation, such as mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils, and contribute to remodeling in asthma and atopic dermatitis. In addition, mediators of allergic inflamma tion that cyclic AMP- associated G protein-coupled receptors, such as histamine receptor 2, might play a role in peripheral tolerance mechanisms against allergens. Current strategies for drug development and allergen-specific immunotherapy exploit these observations with the potentia l to provide cure for allergic diseases.

Regulatory T (Treg) cells are cruc ial players in this immune ba lance network.

The discovery of FO XP3 as an essential transcription factor not only for differentiation an d function of naturally occurring Treg cells but also for regulation of intracellula r molecules related to effector T-cell responses has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases.

REVIEW: cell memory Curr 2006;311:85-115. Typical immune responses lead to prominen t clonal expansion of antigen-specific T and 42B cells followed by differentiation into effector cells. Most ef fector ce lls die at the end of the immune response but some of these cells survive and fo rm long-lived memory cells. The factors controlling the formation and survival of me mory T cells are reviewed. T cell memory induced by prior infection or vaccination provides enhanced protection against subsequent microbial infections . The processes involved in ge nerating and main taining T cell memory are becoming better understood due to r ecent technological advances in identifying memory T cells and monitoring th eir behavior and function in vi vo. Memory T cells develop in response to a progressive set of cues-starting with signals from antigen-loaded, activated antigen- presenting cells (APCs) and inflammatory mediators induced by the innate immune response, to the poorly defined subsequent signals trigge red as the immune response wanes toward homeostasis. The persistence of the resting memory T cells that eventually develop is regulated by cytokines. This chapter discusses recent findings on how memory T cells develop to confer long- term protective immunity. REVIEW: Woodfolk J T-cell responses to allergens. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2007;119:280-94 The allergic response in human beings is neered by CD4(+) T lymphocytes, which secrete T(H)2 cytokines response to activation by alle rgen-derived peptides. Although T(H)2 cells have been well characterized, defining th e properties of allergen-specifi c T cells has proved challenging in human beings because of their low frequency within the T-cell repertoire. However, recent studies have provided insight in to the molecular signature of long-lived human memory T(H)2 cells, which are allergen-specific. T-cell responses directed against allergens develop in early life and are heavily influenced by the type and dose of allergen, and possibly coexposure to microbial products. These responses are su sceptible to suppression by regulatory T cells. This article highlights recent advances in the characterizatio n of allergen-specific memory T(H)2 cells and discusses the heterogeneous nature of regulator y T cells and possible mechanisms of action. The relevance of T-cell epitope mapping studies to unde rstanding the unique nature of T-cell responses to different allergens, as well as to peptide vaccine development, is reviewed. Experimental techniques and approaches for analyzing allergen-specific T ce lls and identifying novel T-cell epitopes are described that may lead to new T-cell-based therapies. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Wang YH Maintenance and polarization of human TH2 central memory T cells by thymic stromal lymphopoietin-activated dendritic cells Immunity. 2006;24:827-38 The identity of TH2 memory cells and the m echanism regulating their maintenance during allergic inflammation remain elusive. We report that circulated human CD4+ T cells expressing the prostaglandin D2 receptor (CRTH2) are TH2 ce ntral memory T cells, characterized by their phenotype, TH2 cytokine production, gene-expressi on profile, and the ability to respond to allergens. Only dendritic cells (DCs) activated by thymic stromal lymphopoietin can induce a robust expansion of CR TH2+CD4+ TH2 memory cells, while maintaining their central TH2 comm further TH2 polarization and express cystatin A, Charcot-Leydon crystal protein, and 43prostaglandin D2 synthase, im plying their broade r roles in allergic inflammation. Infiltrated CRTH2+CD4+ TH2 effector memory T cells in skin lesion of atopic dermatitis were associated with activated DCs, suggesting th at TSLP-DCs play important ro les not only in TH2 priming, but also in the maintenance and further polarization of TH2 central memory cells in allergic diseases. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Allakhverdi Z Expression of CD103 identifies Allergy Clin Immunol occurrin g T regulatory CD4+ (nTreg) cells in human diseases is hampered by the lack of specific surface marker. Indeed, the CD25 antigen, which is typically used to identify nTreg cells, is also expressed on activated effect or T cells. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine whether CD4+ T cells be aring CD103 are suppressor cells, regardless of CD25 coexpression. METHODS: We first compared freshly isolated to nsillar CD103+ CD25- cells with their CD103- CD25high counterparts for their capacity to suppress T-cell response and their expression of FoxP3 mRNA. Next CD103 wa s induced on neonatal or adult CD4+ T cells stimulated with allogeneic de ndritic cells, and the CD103+ and CD103- compared as above. RESULTS: Tonsillar CD4+ CD103+ CD25- T cells displayed comparable suppressive activity and contained similar amounts of FoxP 3 mRNA as their FoxP3 mRNA than the CD103- CD25+ cells isolated from the same cultures. Finally, neonatal al loreactive cells contained more CD103+ Treg cells than their adult counterparts and, unlike the latter, b ecame hyporesponsive to the priming alloantigens. CONCLUSIONS: The examination of CD103 and CD 25 coexpression allows identification of 3 subsets of human CD4+ nTreg cells, and the detection of CD103 on CD4+ T cells identifies nTreg cells, regardless of CD25 coexpression. CLINIC AL IMPLICATIONS: The greater induction of CD103+ suppressor cells by cord blood should be re lated to its successful clinical use as an alternative to adult bone marrow transplantation. f. NK T cells REVIEW: Kronenberg M Toward an understanding of NKT ce ll biology: progress and paradoxes Ann Rev Immunol 2005;23:877-900. Natural killer T (NKT) cells constitute a cons erved T cell sublineage with unique properties, including reactivity for a syntheti c glycolipid presented by CD1d, e xpression of an invariant T cell antigen receptor (TCR) alpha ch ain, and unusual requirements for t hymic selection. They rapidly produce many cytokines after stimulation and th us influence diverse immune responses and pathogenic processes. Because of intensive resear ch effort, we have learned much about factors promoting the development and survival of NKT cells, regulation of thei r cytokine production, and the means by which they influence dendritic cell s and other cell types. Despite this progress, knowledge of the natural antigen(s) they recogni ze and their physiologic role remain incomplete. The activation of NKT cells paradox ically can lead either to suppr ession or stimulation of immune responses, and we cannot predict which will occur. Despite this uncertaint y, many investigators are hopeful that immune therapies can be developed based on NKT cell stimulation. 44REVIEW: Van Kaer.

RESEARCH FRONTIER: Akbari O invariant T-cell-receptor+ natural ki ller N Engl J Med 2006;354:1117-29. BACKGROUND: Bronchial asthma is associated with an inflammatory process that is characterized by the presence in the airways of large numbers of CD4+ T cells producing interleukin-4 and interleukin-13. However, the CD 4 antigen is expressed not only by class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted CD4+ T cells, but also by a newly identified subgroup of T cells, CD1d-restricted natural ki ller T cells. These cells express a conserved (invariant) T-cell receptor and have a potent i mmunoregulatory function. Because mouse models of allergic asthma indicate that natural killer T cells are required for the development of allergen- induced airway hyperreactivity, we hypot hesized that natural killer T cells play an important role in human asthma. METHODS: We used CD1d-tetram ers, antibodies specific for natural killer T cells, as well as reverse-transcriptase-polymeras e-chain-reaction analysis of the invariant T-cell receptor of natural killer T cells to assess the frequency and dist ribution of natural killer T cells in the lungs and in the circulating blood of 14 patients w ith asthma. RESULTS: About 60 percent of the pulmonary CD4+CD3+ cells in patients with m oderate-to-severe persis tent asthma were not class II MHC-restricted CD4+ T cells but, rather, natural killer T cells. The natural killer T cells expressed an invariant T-cell recept or and produced type 2 helper cy tokines. In contrast, the CD4+ T cells found in the lung s of patients with sarcoidosis were conventional CD4+ CD3+ T cells, not natural killer T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Together with studies in mice indicating a requirement for natural killer T cells in the de velopment of allergen-induced airway hyperreactiv ity, our results strongly suggest that CD4+ natura l killer T cells play a promin ent pathogenic role in human asthma.

REVIEW: Kang, J Cytokine functions in the formativ stages of a lymphocyte's Curr Five l lymphocyte differentiation and main tenance have been identified and studied in depth. IL-7 sits at the apex of this cytokine hierarchy in terms of functional significance during lymphocyte development. Th e IL-7-dominant phase of lymphopoiesis is preceded by the actions of c-Kit ligand (also called stem cell factor; SCF) and fetal liver kinase 2 ligand (Flk-2L); the function of both of these cy tokines is essential for the maintenance and development of the progenitor compartment of multip le lineages. IL-7 activity is complemented by two cytokines whose receptors share s IL-7 receptor: thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and core cytokines on precursor lymphocyte subsets overlap during development and are ofte n synergistic. Recent studies are beginning to uncover the molecular mechanisms of these interrelated core cytokine functions. 46 REVIEW: Harnett MM, Katz E, Ford CA. Differential signaling during B-cell maturation. Immunol Lett. 2005; Apr 15;98:33-44 The molecular mechanism by which the antigen recep tors (BCR) on B cells can elicit differential maturation state-specific responses is one of the central problems in B-cell differentiation yet to be resolved. Indeed, many of the ear ly signalling events detected following BCR ligation, such as activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK), C (PLC), phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI (PKC) and the RasMAP K (mitogen activating protein kinase) signaling cascades are observed throughout B-cell maturati on. However, it is becoming clear that the differential functional responses of these BCR-c oupled signals observed dur ing B-cell maturation are dependent on a number of parameters incl uding signal strength and duration, subcellular localisation of the signal, matu ration-restricted expression of downstream signaling effector elements/isoforms and modulation of signal by co-receptors. Thus, the combined signature of BCR signaling is likely to dictate the functional response and act as a developmental checkpoint for Bcell maturation. REVIEW: Gauld SB, Dal Porto JM, Cambier JC. B cell antigen receptor signaling: role s in cell development and disease. Science. 2002; May 31;296(5573):1641-2. Signals propagated through the B cell antigen r eceptor (BCR) are vital for the development and survival of B lymphocytes in both the bone marrow and the periphery. These signals not only guide maturation and activation but also affect the removal of potenti ally self-reactive B lymphocytes. Interestingly, these signals are know n to be either ligand-independent (\"tonic\" signals) or induced by ligand (ant igen) binding to the BCR. We focus on the problems that occur in B cell development due to defects in signals emanating from the BCR. In addition, we present the B Cell Antigen Receptor Pathway, an STKE Connections Map that illustrates the events involved in B cell signaling REVIEW: Patke A Survival signaling in resting B cells. Curr Opin Immunol 2004; 16:251-5 The survival of mature resting B cells in th e periphery depends on signaling from the Bcell receptor (BCR) and the B-cell activ ating factor of the TNF family receptor (BAFFR). Engagement of both receptors promotes NF-kappa B activit y, which contributes to Bcell survival through different pathways. BCR signaling leads to activati on of the inhibitor of NF-kappa B kinase (IKK) complex via Carma1, Bcl10 and MALT1, whereas BAFF-R engagement promotes processing of NF-kappa B2 protein p100, which is dependent on NF-kappa B- inducing kinase (NIK) and IKK alpha. Proximal signaling intermediates are pot entially common to both pathways. This study suggests that BCR and BAFF-R su rvival signaling are mutually dependent and that BAFF-R signaling enhances the expression of survival ge nes through direct chromatin modifications in NFkappa B target gene promoters. 47b.

Helper T (Th) cell-regulated B cell immunity pr ogresses in an ordered cascade of cellular development that culminates in the producti on of antigen-specific memory B cells. The recognition of peptide MHC class II complexes on activated antig en-presenting cells is cr itical for effective Th cell selection, clonal expansion, and effector Th cell functi on development (Phase I). Cognate effector Th cell-B cell interactions then promot e the development of either short-lived plasma cells (PCs) or germinal centers (GCs) (Phase II). Th ese GCs expand, diversify, a nd select high-affinity variants of antigen-specific B cells for entry into the long-lived memory B cell compartment (Phase III). Upon antigen rechallenge, memory B cells rapidly expand and differentiate into PCs under the cognate control of memory Th cells (Phase IV). We review the cellu lar and molecular regulators of this dynamic process with emphasis on the multiple memory B cell fates that develop in vivo. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Nair DT Epitope recognition by diverse in an antibodyresponse. 48J Immunol 2002; 168:2371-82 structures of distinct mAbs that recognize a common epitope of a peptide Ag have been determ ined and analyzed in the unbound and bound forms. These Abs display dissimilar binding site structures in the absence of the Ag. Th e dissimilarity is primarily expressed in the conformations of complementarity-determining re gion H3, which is responsible for defining the epitope specificity. Interestingly, however, the three Abs exhibit similar complementaritydetermining region conformations in the Ag binding site while recognizing the common epitope, indicating that different pathwa ys of binding are used for Ag recognition. The epitope also exhibits conformational similar ity when bound to each of these Abs, although the peptide Ag was otherwise flexible. The observed conformational convergence in the epitope and the Ag binding site was facilitated by the pl asticity in the nature of interactions. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Zheng NY Human immunoglobulin selection associated with class switch and possible tolerogenic origins for C delta class-switched B cells. J Clin Invest 2004; 113:1188-201 Changes to the human antibody repertoire for a we ll-characterized autore activity from antibodies encoded by the V(H)4-34 gene and for other hallmar ks of an autoreactive re pertoire are apparent mainly for class-switched B cells and not for Ig M germinal center, IgM memory, or IgM plasma cells. Other possible indicators of autoreactivity found selected w ith immunoglobulin class include J(H)6 gene segment usage, increased frequency of B cells with long third hypervariable regions, and distal J(kappa) gene segment bi as. Of particular interest is the finding that B cells with these same characteristics are selected into the lineage of B cells that have undergone the unusual class switch from constant region C mu to C delta (C delta-CS). The C delta-CS population also displays an increased frequency of charged amino acids localized to the complementarity-determining regions, further suggesting autoreactivity, and ev idence is presented that these B cells had undergone extensive receptor editing. Thus, the C delta- CS lineage may be a \"sink\" for B cells harboring autoreactive specificiti es in normal humans. A model for a new tolerizing mechanism that could account for the C delta-CS lineage is presented. c. Maturation of B lymphocytes REVIEW: Rothenberg EV. Cell lineage regulators in B and T cell development. Nat Immunol 2007;8:441-4. This article provides a nice summary of the c ontents of a special issue on B and T cell development that highlights a pivotal set of regul atory molecules that have emerged as central controllers of cell identity in the immune system. Pax5 operates at all levels of B cell development, through its unique combination of positive and nega tive regulatory activities. In the process, it competes with two different antagonists, Notc h and Blimp-1, which are each much more stage specific and context dependent than Pax5 in their modes of action. REVIEW: Nutt SL. 49The transcriptional r egulation of B cell lineage commitment. Immunity 2007;26:715-25. The expression of lineage-associated genes, as well as the survival and expansion of committed B cell progenitors, is controlled by multiple transcri ptional regulators and growth-factor receptors. This review focuses on recent studies that have re vealed that efficient B cell commitment requires the combined activity of multiple transcription factors in a complex gene regulatory network. REVIEW: Shapiro-Shelef M, Regulation of Plasma-Cell Development. Nat Rev Immunol. 2005: 5, 230-242. Plasma cells are the terminally differentiated, no n-dividing effector cells of the B-cell lineage. They are cellular factories devoted to the task of synthesizing and secreting thousands of molecules of clonospecific antibody each second. To respond to microbial pathogens with the necessary specificity and rapidity, B cells ar e exquisitely regulated with respect to both development in the bone marrow and activation in the periphery. This review focuses on the terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells , including the different subsets of B cells that become plasma cells, the mechanism of regulation of this transition, the transc ription factors that control each developmental stage and the ch aracteristics of long-lived plasma cells. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Tangye SG Human IgM+CD27+ B cells: memory B cells or \"memory\" B cells? J Immunol 2007;179:13-9. Memory B cells are generated in germinal centers (GC) and contribute to serological immunity by rapidly differentiating into plasma cells. Hu man memory B cells can be identified by the expression of CD27. These cells exhibit more rapid responses than na\u00efve (CD27-) B cells following stimulation in vitro, consis tent with the heightened kineti cs of secondary responses in vivo. CD27+ B cells express mutated immunoglobu lin V region genes; however, a significant proportion continues to express IgM, suggesting the existence of IgM+ memory B cells. The observation that mutated IgM+CD27+ B cells are generated in huma ns who cannot form GC led to the conclusions that these cells are generated independently of GC and thus are not memory cells and that they mediate responses to T cell-independent antigen. Although some studies support the idea that IgM+CD27+ B cells participate in T cell-independent responses, many do not. This review provides alternate interp retations of the biology of IgM+ CD27+ B cells and proposes that they indeed are memory cells. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Cobaleda C Pax5: the guardian of B cell identity and function. Nat Immunol 2007;8:463-70. The transcription factor Pax5 is essential fo r commitment of lymphoid progenitors to the B lymphocyte lineage. Pax5 fulfills a dual role by repressing B lineage \"inappropriate\" genes and simultaneously activating B lineage-specific genes. This transcriptional reprogramming restricts the broad signaling capacity of uncommitted progenitors to the B cell pathway, regulates cell adhesion and migration, induces V(H)-DJ(H) recombination, f acilitates (pre-)B cell receptor 50signaling and promotes developm ent to the mature B cell stage. Conditional Pax5 inactivation in early and late B lymphocytes revealed an essent ial role for Pax5 in controlling the identity and function of B cells throughout B lymphopoiesis. Pax5 has also been implicated in human B cell malignancies, where it is deregul ated by chromosomal leukemias and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. d. Maturation of the antibody response REVIEW: De Noia JM Molecular mechanisms of antibody somatic hypermutation Annual Rev of Biochem 2007;76:1-22 Functional antibody genes are assembled by V-D- J joining and then di versified by somatic hypermutation. This hypermutation results from stepwise incorporati on of single nucleotide substitutions into the V gene, underpinning much of antibody diversity an d affinity maturation. Hypermutation is triggered by act ivation-induced deaminase (AID), an enzyme which catalyzes targeted deamination of deoxycytidine residues in DNA. The pathways used for processing the AID-generated U:G lesions determine the variety of base substitutions observed during somatic hypermutation. Thus, DNA replication across the uracil yields transiti on mutations at C:G pairs, whereas uracil excision by UNG uracil -DNA glycosylase creates abasic sites that can also yield transversions. Recognition of the U:G mismatch by MSH2/MSH6 triggers a mutagenic patch repair in which polymerase eta plays a major ro le and leads to mutati ons at A:T pairs. AID- triggered DNA deamination also underpins immunoglobulin variable (IgV) gene conversion, isotype class switching, and some oncogeni c translocations in B cell tumors.

Biologic process initiated by antibo opsonization, complement fixation, antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity REVIEW: Joshi T Fc gamma receptor signaling in phagocytes Intern J Hematol 2006; 84:210-6 Fcgamma receptors are among the best-studied key features of Fcgamma receptor-mediated mediators such as cytokines and reactive oxygen species. These events are elegantly regulated by the simultaneous engagement of activating and inhi bitory Fcgamma receptors and by intracellular signaling molecules. Extensive studies in the past several years have defined the molecular mechanisms of the phagocytic process. The purpose of this review is to revisit some of the well- established signaling pathways as well as to summarize the new findings in this field. REVIEW: Takai T. Fc receptors and their role in immune regulation and autoimmunity J Clin Immunol. 2005;25:1-18 The activation threshol d of cells in the immune system is often tuned by cell surface molecules. The Fc receptors expressed on various hematopoi etic cells constitute critical elements for activating or downmodulating immune responses and combines humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Thus, Fc receptors are the intelligent sensors of the immune status in the individual. However, impaired regulation by Fc receptors will lead to unresponsiveness or hyperreactivity to foreign as well as self-antigens. Murine models for autoimmune disease i ndicate the indispensable roles of the inhibitory Fc recep tor in the suppression of such di sorders, whereas activating-type FcRs are crucial for the onset and exacerbati on of the disease. The development of many autoimmune diseases in humans may be caused by impairment of the human Fc receptor regulatory system. This review is aimed at provi ding a current overview of the mechanism of Fc receptor-based immune regulation and the possibl e scenario of how autoimmune disease might result from their dysfunction. REVIEW: Barrington R The role of complement in infl ammation and adaptive immunity Immunol Rev 2001; 180: 5-15 This article reviews two importa nt aspects of the complement system, i) host protection and 52inflammation, and ii) regulation of B lym phocytes of adaptive immunity. While these two roles appear distinct, they are linke d. Nnatural antibody and classi cal pathway complement work together in host protection agai nst bacterial infection on the one hand but, on the other, they co- operate to induce inflammation as observed in reperfusion injury. REVIEW: Casadevall A Antibody-mediated regulation of cellular im munity and the inflammatory response. Trends Immunol 2003; 24:474-8 For many pathogens the role of antibody-mediated immunity (AMI) is poorly understood, in part because of the limited tools available to establis h antibody efficacy. AMI is classically associated with opsonization, toxin and vira l neutralization, complement fi xation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, re cent studies indicate new functions for AMI ranging from direct antimicrobial action to modulation of the infla mmatory response. The efficacy of AMI against some pathogens is dependent on cell-mediated imm unity. A new interpretation of the role of AMI is proposed whereby it is in proinflammatory the ear ly stages of infection and anti-inflammatory at later stages of the host-microbe interaction and in the setting of established immunity and/or in an immune individual. LANDMARK INVESTIGATION: Graziano RF Fc gamma s and granulocytes are cytotoxic trigger molecules for tumor cells J Immunol. 1987;139:3536-41 As part of an effort to define the cytotoxic trig ger molecules on huma n myeloi d cells, the ability of the different Fc receptors for IgG (Fc gamma R) to mediate killing of tumor cell lines by monocytes and granulocytes was examined. Th is was accomplished by studying cytolysis of hybridoma cell (HC) targets bearing surface antibody directed toward the di fferent Fc gamma R. The HC line, HC IV.3A, which bears Ig directed to the low affinity Fc gamma R (Fc gamma RII) on monocytes and neutrophils was lysed monocytes. The extent of lysis of HC IV.3A was approximately equal to that of anti-Fc ga mma RI (the high affin ity Fc gamma R on human monocytes) bearing HC lines (H C 32.2A and HC 62A) and was not augmented by treatment of the with interferon-gamma Since Fc gamma RI is not de tectable on untreated neutrophils and is induced by IFN-gamma on these cells, lysi s of HC 32.2A by IFN-gamma- activated neutrophils correlated receptor induction. On the other hand, Fc gamma RII was present at equal levels on unt reated and IFN-gamma-treated neutrophils, but only IFN-gamma- treated neutrophils mediated cytotoxicity via Fc gamma RII. In this case, enhanced killing appeared to be due to events other than an in crease in Fc gamma RII number. Neither untreated nor IFN-gamma-treated mediated of the anti-Fc gamma RIII bearing HC 3G8A. Thus, binding to the tumor ta rget via this Fc receptor does not lead to lysis and may initiate signals distinct from those triggered through Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII. Surprisingly, HC bearing high amounts of mouse IgG1 antibody of irrelevant specificit y were also lysed by monocytes. This lysis was blocked by soluble IV.3 antibody and thus appeared to be due to binding of the Fc portion of the surface Ig to Fc gamma RII on monocytes. Furthermore, monocytes from donors with a form of Fc gamma RII incapable of binding aggregated mouse 53IgG1 did not lyse these HC, l lysis of HC demo nstrating that this structurally different Fc gamma RII remained a functional tri gger molecule. Overall, these studies have demonstrated the specificity of Fc recep tors in triggering monocyte- and granulocyte- mediated antibody-dependent tumor cell killing and have begun to dissect functional similarities and differences among the three define d Fc gamma R on hu man myeloid cells. f. IgE mediated immediate and late phase reactions REVIEW: Hansen I Mediators of inflammation in the early a nd the late phase of allergic rhinitis. Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol 2004;4:159-63 Inflammatory mediators are released and cells are activated and recruited to the mucosa as a result of an IgE mediated immune respons e. In this review, early and late phase responses of the allergic type I reaction are described, in cluding the different cell types and mediators involved. Special attention is paid to new inflammatory processes. REVIEW: Rosenwaser L New insights into the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis Allergy Asthma Proc. 2007;28:10-5 The immune response to an allergen is dependent on an initial sens itization process, with future exposures triggering a two-part a llergic response includ ing an early and a late phase. The process by which an allergen is recognized as such, incl uding which cell types and cytokines are involved in the sensitization p rocess, has become clearer ov er the last several years. Similarly, the roles of the different preformed mediators responsible fo r many of the signs and symptoms of the early phase response have been elucidated. Recent work also has shed some light on the multitude of cells and mediators involved in the late-phase r eactions, which can lead to priming and long-term inflammation. This article will discuss some of th is recent work as well as review the basics behind all of the stages of the allergic response, especially as they apply to the nose and upper airway. LANDMARK PUBLICATION: Solley GO The late phase of the immediate wheal and flare skin reaction. Its dependence upon IgE antibodies J Clin Invest. 1976;58:408-20 IgE antibodies are usually thought to induce only immediate skin re actions. We have shown that the intradermal injection of a number of different allergens can produce a prolonged inflammatory reaction after the immediat e wheal and flare in most sensitive subjects. This late inflammatory response occurs 6-12 h after challe nge and is characterized by diffu se edema, erythema, pruritus, and heat. Both immediate and late responses can also be seen afte r passive sensitization of skin sites in nonatopic subjects. That IgE is involved in inducing the reaction was shown by the abolition of both immediate and late responses by passive transfer tests in the following experiments: (a) heating atopi c serum at 56degreesC for 4 h, (b) removing IgE from the atopic serum by a solid phase anti-IgE immunoabsorbent, and (c) competitively inhibiting the binding of IgE antibodies to cells by an IgE myeloma prot ein. In addition, both responses were induced by 54affinity chromatography-purified IgE antibody, fo llowed by antigenic challenge. Very sim ilar lesions could also be induced by intraderma l injection of Compound 48/80, thus suggesting a central role in the reaction for the mast cell or basophil. Histologically, the late phase is characterized by edema and a mixed cellular infi ltration, predominantly lymphocytic immunofluor escent staining did not show deposition of immunoglobulins or complement compone nts, except IgM in 2 of 15 and C3 in 1 of 15 patients. This finding indicate s that the late phase does not depend on the deposition of immune complexes. The results of the study suggest that IgE-alle rgen interacti on on the surfaces of mast cells or on infiltrating basophils causes both immediate and late cutaneous responses. g. Immune complexes - immunologic pr operties and mechanisms of clearance REVIEW: Nydegger U Immune complex pathophysiology Ann NY Acad Sci 2007;1109:66-83 Antigen-antibody (Ab) interactions that lead to the formation of immune complexes (ICs) are subtle biochemical processes determining hea lth or disease according to the outcome. Good laboratory practice (GLP)-acknowledge d IC detection methods reveal that plasma levels of up to 15 microg/mL heat-aggregated immunoglobulin G (Ig G) equivalents are normal, indicating the physiological role of ICs. Among the major variab les that influence the equilibrium association constant Ka, are specificity and epitope density of the antigen, Ig class/ subclass of the Ab, IC complement (C)-activating capacity, Fc receptor (F cR) interaction, and cyt okine activation pattern. The Ka of antigen-Ab binding at approximately 20 degrees C ranges from low affinity (105) to high affinity (107-1011). Bene ficial ICs serve to remove and/or neutralize infectious or toxic antigens, following an infectious attack in immune and vaccinated hosts. Ci rculating ICs are more prone for benefit than tissue-bound IC s, which reflect in situ formation and/or undesired deposition in tissues due to overflow from insufficient reticuloendothelial system (RES) removal. The classical textbook topic on ICs st ill holds true but is under re vision because of the improved knowledge of effector systems, such as C, cyt okine, and FcR apparatus. and monoclonal antibodies directed at C activation products and/or cytokines. REVIEW: Jancar S Immune Trends Immunol 2005;26:48-55. Antigen-antibody complexes can damage tissues by triggering inflammation. Recent studies have enabled the description of a sequence of steps, which depend on the intra- or perivascular location of complex formation. Acute lethal toxicity and circ ulatory shock as a result of the acute release of inflammatory mediators can occu r after intravascular complex fo rmation. The lesions associated with perivascular complexes are characterized by plasma leakage and the recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These lesions are modulated by medi ators released from endothelial cells, namely nitric oxide, endothelins and lipid mediat ors, and provide an appropriate basis for the activation of both arms of hemost asis: coagulation and fibrinolysis. The balance between both activation systems can explain the late occurrence of both tissue fibrosis and organ remodeling. 55 8. Other immune and inflammatory mechanisms a. Natural killer cells, their CD markers and functions REVIEW: Boyton RJ, Altmann DM . Natural killer cells, ki ller immunoglobulin-like receptors an d human leucocyte antigen class I in disease. Clin Exp Immunol. 2007;149:1-8 Natural killer cells constitute a potent, rapid pa rt of the innate immune response to infection or transformation, and also generate a link to pr iming of adaptive immun ity. Their function can encompass direct cytotoxicity as well as the re lease of cytokines and chemokines. In humans, a major component of natural killer (NK) cell targ et recognition depends mainly on the surveillance of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I mo lecules by killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). Different KIR can transmit inhibitory or activatory signals to the cell, and effector function is considered to result from the balance of th ese contributing signals. The regulation of NK cell responses depends on a number of variables: KIR genotype, HLA genotype, heterozygosity versus homozygosity for these, whether there is cogna te recognition between th e HLA and KIR products carried by an individual, clonal variation betwee n individual NK cells in KIR expression, and the specific modulation of HLA expression by infecti on, transformation or pep tide binding. Different HLA/KIR genotypes can impart diff erent thresholds of activation to the NK cell repertoire and such genotypic variation has been found to confer altered risk in a number of diseases including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) susceptibility and progression, hepatitis C virus clearance, idiopathic bronchiectasis, autoimmunity and cancer. REVIEW: Radaev S Structure and function of natu ral killer su rface receptors Annu Rev Biophys Struct. 2003;32:93-114 Since mid-1990, with cloning and id entification of several families of natural killer (NK) receptors, research on NK cells began to receive a ppreciable attention. Determination of structures of NK cell surface receptors and their ligand complexes led to a fast growth in our understanding of the activation and ligand rec ognition by these receptors as well as their function in innate immunity. Functionally, NK cell surf ace receptors are divided into two groups, the inhibitory and the activating receptors. Structural ly, they belong to either the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor superfamily or the C-type lec tin-like receptor (CTLR) superfam ily. Their ligands are either members of class I major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) or homologs of class I MHC molecules. The inhibitory form of NK receptors provides the pr otective immunity through recognizing class I MHC molecules with self-peptides on healthy hos t cells. The activating, or the noninhibitory, NK receptors mediate the killing of tumor or virally infected cells through their specific ligand recognition. The stru ctures of activating and inhibitory NK cell surface receptors and their complexes with the ligands determin ed to date, including killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their complexes with HLA molecules, CD94, Ly49A, and its complex with H-2Dd, and NKG2D receptors and their complexes with class I MHC homologs, are reviewed here. 56REVIEW: Tupin E, Kinjo Y, Kronenberg M. The unique role of natural killer T cel ls in the response to microor ganisms. Nat Rev Microbiol. 2007;5:405-17 Natural killer T (NKT) cells combine features of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Recently, it has become evident that these T cells have crucial role s in the response to infectious agents. The antigen receptor expressed by NKT cel ls directly recognizes unusual glycolipids that are part of the membrane of certa in Gram-negative bacteria and spir ochetes. Moreover, even in the absence of microbial glycolipid antigens, these T cells respond to inna te cytokines produced by dendritic cells that have been activated by mi crobes. This indirect sensing of infection, by responding to cytokines from activat ed dendritic cells, allows NKT ce lls to react to a broad range of infectious agents. b. Lymphokine activated killer cells and their effects REVIEW: June CH Adoptive T cell therapy for cancer in the clinic J Clinical Investm2007;117:1466-76 The transfusion of lymphocytes, referred to as ad optive T cell therapy, is being tested for the treatment of cancer and chronic infections. Adoptive T cell thera py has the potential to enhance antitumor immunity, augment vaccine efficacy, and limit graft-versus-host disease. This form of personalized medicine is now in various early- an d late-stage clinical trials. These trials are currently testing strategies to infuse tumor-infilt rating lymphocytes, CTLs, Th cells, and Tregs. Improved molecular biology techniques have also increased enthusia sm and feasibility for testing genetically engineered T cells. The current status of the field and prospects for clinical translation are reviewed herein. KEY INVESTIGATION: Winter H Tumor regression after adoptive tr ansfer of effector T cells is i ndependent of Fas ligand (APO-1L/CD95L). transfer r-specific effector T cells can result in comple te regression and cure mice with systemic melanoma, but the mechan isms responsible for regression are not well characterized. Perforin- and Fas ligand (APO-1/CD95 ligand)-media ted cytotoxicity have been proposed as mechanisms for T cell-mediated tumor destruction. To determine the role of perforin and Fas ligand (FasL) in T cell-mediated B16BL6- D5 we generated D5-specific effector T cells from tumor vaccine-draining lymph nodes of wild type (wt), perforin knock out (PKO), or FasL mutant (gld) mice and treated established D5 metastases in mice with the same genotype. Eff ector T cells from wt, PKO and gld mice induced complete regression of pulmonary metastases and significantly prolonged su rvival of the treated animals regardless of their genotype. Complete tumor regression induced by PKO effector T cells was also observed in a sarcoma m odel (MCA-310). Furthermore, a doptive transfer of PKO and wt effector T cells provided long-te rm immunity to D5. Therapeutic T cells from wt, PKO, or gld mice exhibit a tumor-specific type 1 cytokine pr ofile; they secrete IFN-gamma, but not IL-4. In 57these models, T cell-me diated tumor regression and long-term antitumor immunity are perforin FasL independent. LANDMARK PUBLICATION: cell phenomenon. Lysis of natu ral fresh solid tumor cells by interleukin 2-activated autolo gous human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBL) from cancer patients or normal individuals re sulted in expression of cytotoxicity toward 20 of 21 natural killer (NK)-resistant fresh solid tumor cells tested. Fresh solid tumor cells were resistant to NK-media ted lysis in 10 autologous patients' PBL-tumor interactions, and from 17 normal individuals tested against 13 allogeneic fresh tumors. Culture of PBL in IL-2 for 2-3 d was required for the lymphokine activated killers (LAK) to be expressed, and lytic activity toward a vari ety of NK-resistant fresh and cultured tumor targets developed in parallel. Autologous IL-2 was functional in LAK activation, as well as in terferon-depleted IL-2 preparations. Irradiation of responder PBL before culture in IL-2 prevented LAK development. Precursors of LAK were present in PBL depleted of adherent cells and in NK-void thoracic duct lymphocytes, suggesting that the precursor is ne ither a monocyte nor an NK cell. LAK effectors expressed the serologically defined T cell mark ers of OKT.3, Leu-1, and 4F2, but did the monocyte/NK marker OKM-1. Lysis of autol ogous fresh solid tumors by LAK from cancer patients' PBL was demonstrated in 85% of the pa tient-fresh tumor combinations. Our data present evidence that the LAK system is a phenomenon di stinct from either NK or CTL systems that probably accounts for a large number of reported noncla ssical cytotoxicities. The biological role of LAK cells is not yet known, althoug h it is suggested that these cells may be functional in immune surveillance against human solid tumors. c. Basophil mediated inflammatory states REVIEW: Obata K, Mukai N, Karasuyama H. Basophils are essential initiators of a novel type of chronic allergic inflammation. Blood. 2007;110:913-20. Basophils represent less than 1% of peripheral bl ood leukocytes and have often been considered as minor and possibly redundant circulating mast cells. The recent finding that basophils readily generate large quantities of T help er 2 (Th2) cytokines such as IL-4 provided new insights into the possible role of basophils in al lergic disorders and immunity to pathogens. However, in-depth studies on basophils, particularly their functions in vivo, have been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models, such as mutant animals deficient only in basophils. Here, we established a mAb that reacted wi th mouse basophils and depleted them when administered in vivo. The mAb treatment of mice did not show any significant effect on classi cal allergic reactions such as passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and contact hypersensitivity. In contrast, it completely abolished the development of IgE-mediated chroni c allergic dermatitis that is characterized by massive eosinophil infiltration, even though basophils accounted for only approximately 2% of the infiltrates. The treatment during the progression of the dermatitis resulted in drastic reduction in numbers of infiltrating eosinophils and neutrophils, concomitantly with elimination of basophils 58from the skin lesions. Thus, basophils play a pivotal role in the developm ent of IgE-mediated chronic allergic inflammation, as an in itiator rather than as an effector. REVIEW: Gibbs BF Human basophils as effectors and immunomodulat ors of allergic inflammation and innate immunity Clin Exp Med 2005;5:43-9 Basophils have often stood in th e shadow of their tissue-fixed mast cell counterparts which share some, common features, such as high-affinity IgE receptor expression and the ability to release histamine. That rodent mast cells produce a variet y of pro-allergic and in flammatory cytokines has further added to the deception th at basophils only play a minor role in allergic inflammation. Surprisingly, in humans, basophils, but not mast cells, appear to be the prime early producers of the Th2-type cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, which perf orm several crucial func tions in initiating and maintaining allergic responses. This putative immunomodulatory ro le of basophils is supported further by their ability to expr ess CD40 ligand, which, together w ith IL-4 and IL-13, serve as inductors of B-cell proliferation and class switching to IgE and IgG4. Moreover, human basophils are the main cellular source for rapid IL-4 generation, a mandatory requirement for the development of Th2 responses. Recent specific staining techniques have localised basophils in various tissues affected by allergic diseases and it appears likely, but remains to be proven, that the interaction of basophils, T cells a nd B cells at these sites propagate pro-allergic immune responses. Additionally, basophil activa tion is not restricted to antigen- specific IgE crosslinking but can be caused in non-sensitised individu als by parasitic antigens, plant lectins and viral superantigens binding to non-specific IgEs. Finally, the presence of novel IgE-independent receptor targets that cause trafficking and Th2 cytokine release from basophils further underlines their potential role in innate as well as adaptive immunity. RESEARCH FRONTIER: De Swerdt A Detection of basophil activated IgG autoantibo dies in chronic idiopathic urticaria by induction of CD 63. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2005 : 662-7. Approximately 40% to 50% nts with (CIU ) have IgG autoantibodies which induce histamine release from basophils and cutaneous mast cells. A positive autologous serum skin test response is believed to reflect the presence of these autoantibodies. OBJECTIVE: We sought to further define the functional properties of and develop a sensitive functional as say for detection of autoantibodies in patients with CIU. METHODS: Sera from patients with CIU (n=61) and sera subjects with donor basophils. Activ ation of basophils was determined on the basis of CD 63 surface expression, as analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer. RESULTS: A positive basophil activation test result wa s found in 51% of patients with CIU, and basophil-activating properties were present in the IgG fractions of sera . When both the in vitr o test and the autologous serum skin test were considered, basophil/mast cell -activating autoantibodies were present in 62% of the patients. Patients with a positive basophi l activation test result ha d a significantly higher prevalence of other autoantibodies, had more severe urticaria, a nd were more likely to have angioedema. 59 d.

These 3 proteins complex together within the cell membrane, and initiation depends on autoactivation of factor XII on binding to gC1qR (the receptor for the globular heads of the C1q subcomponent of comple ment). There is also a factor XII-independent bypass mechanism requiring a cell-derived cofactor or protease that enzyme. Angioedema that is bradykinin dependent results from hereditary or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiencies or use of angiotensin-converting enzyme i nhibitors to treat hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, or scleroderma. The role for bradykinin in allergic rh initis, asthma, and anaphylax is is to contribute to tissue hyperresponsiveness, loca l inflammation, and hypotension. Activ ation of the plasma cascade occurs as a result of heparin release and endothelial-cell activa tion and as a secondary event caused by other pathways of inflammation. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Bork K Treatment of acute edema attacks in hereditar y angioedema angioedema, bradykinin is assumed to be the most important mediator of edema formation. Objective- To assess whether the selective bradykin in receptor-2 antagonist Icatibant is effective in acute of hereditary angioedema. Methods- In this uncontro lled pilot study, 15 patients with 20 attacks were treated with Icatibant. The attacks were analyzed by usi ng a standardized and validated visual analog scale measurement and compared with historical data of untreated attacks. Plasma bra dykinin concentration was measured before and 4 hours after intravenous Icatibant treatment. Results- Symptom intensity decrea sed within 4 hours after administ ration of Icatibant; the median time to onset of symptom relief was 1.50, 1.42, and 1.13 hours in the intravenous groups and 0.58 and 0.45 hours in the subcutaneous groups, respectively. The median difference in the 10-cm visual analog scale 4 hours after start of treatment was 4.11 cm (95% CI, 1.72-6.07). Compared with untreated attacks, Icatiban t treatment reduced the mean (SD) time to onset of symptom relief by 97% from 42 \u00b1 14 to 1.16 \u00b1 0.95 hours (all groups combined). Median bradykinin concentration was 7-fold above the norm during acute attacks at 48.5 pmo l/L and decreased to 18.0 pmol/L 4 hours after Icatib ant infusion or injection. Conclusion -Icatibant was effective in treati ng acute attacks of hereditary angioedema. 60Clinical implications -This is the first report demo nstrating the clinical usefulness of antagonizing bradykinin binding to bradykinin recept or-2 in hereditary , et al Expression of kinin B1 and B2 receptors in im mature, monocyte-derived dendritic cells and bradykinin-mediated increase Lys-des[Arg(9)]-BK, are important inflammatory mediators that act via two specific G protein-coupled kinins, B(1) and B(2) receptors (B(2)R). Kinins influence the activity of immune cells by stimulating the synthesis of cytokines, eicosanoids, and chemotactic factors. Whether human dendritic ce lls (DC) express kinin receptors and whether kinins influence DC function are unknown. Fluorescence immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR were used to demonstrate that immature hum an monocyte-derived (hMo-DC) constitutively expressed kinins B(1)R and B(2)R. Kinin recepto r expression was induced on the 3rd and 4th days of culture during differentiati on of hMo-DC from monocytes and was not dependent on the presence of IL-4 or GM-CSF. Although monocytes also expressed B(2)R mRNA, the protein was detected. The kinin agonists BK and Lys-des[Arg(9)]-BK up-re gulated the expression of their respective receptors. BK, acting via the B(2)R, in creased intracellular Fluor-4 AM. Evaluation of migration in Trans-well chambers demonstrat ed significant enhancement by BK of migration of immature hMo-DC, which was B(2)R-dependent. However, kinins did not induce maturation of hMo-DC. The novel finding that kinin receptors are constitu tively expressed in immature hMo-DC suggests that these receptors may be expressed in the absence of proinflammatory stimuli. BK, which increases the migration of immature hMo-DC in v itro, may play an important role in the migration of immature DC in noninflammatory conditions a nd may also be involved in the recruitment of immature DC to sites of inflammation. e. Arachidonic Acid Metabolites and Inflammation REVIEW: Boyce JA . Mast cells and eicosanoid mediator s: sy stem of reciprocal paracrine and autocrine regulation. Immunol Rev. 2007;217:168-85. When activated by specific antigen, compleme nt, or other transmembrane stimuli, mast cells (MCs) generate three eicosanoids: prostaglandin (PG)D(2), leukotriene (LT)B(4), parent the cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs). These diverse lipid mediators, which are generated from a single cell memb rane-associated precursor, arachidonic acid, can initiate, amplify, or dampen inflammatory responses and influence the magnitude, duration, and nature of subsequent immune responses. PGD( 2) and cysLTs, which were originally recognized for their bronchoconstricting and vasoactive prope rties, also serve diverse and pivotal functions in effector cell trafficking, antigen presentation, leukocyte activation, matrix deposition, and fibrosis. LTB(4) is a powerful chemoattractant for neutrophils and certain lymphocyte subsets. Thus, MCs can contribute to each of these processes through eicosanoid generation. Additionally, MCs express G-protein-coupled receptors specific for cysLTs, LTB (4), and another eicosanoid, PGE(2). Each of these receptors can regulate MC functions in vi vo by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. This 61review focuses on the biologic functions for MC-a ssociated eicosanoids, the regulation of their production, and the mechanisms by which eicosanoi ds may regulate MC function in host defense and disease.

J Allerg Clin Immunol 2006;117:1036-9 Prostaglandins (PGs), small lipid molecules de rived from arachidonic acid by COX enzymes, are critical mediators of allergic inflammation. Our u nderstanding of the role of PGs in allergic lung inflammation has been hampered by the very short biologic half-life of these mediators, which has made mechanistic studies difficu lt in human subjects. However, advances in molecular biology and pharmacology have given investigators the o pportunity to examine the role of specific prostanoids in the development of allergic infl ammation in animal models. Studies investigating specific PG receptors are also elucidating the mechanisms by which PGs regulate the pulmonary allergic phenotype. This review summarizes the current literatu re on the role of PGs and PG receptors in allergic lung inflammation. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Jiang Y.

Cytokines/Chemokines and their receptors REVIEW: Chemokines and their receptors in allergic disease. Pease JE J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2006;118:305-18 Mechanisms of chem oattraction underlie the spatial organization of the cells of the immune system under basal conditions and the localization of these cells to sites of inflammation. The chemokines, a family of around 50 small proteins, play a ma jor role in these processes. Leukocytes are equipped with cell-surface sensors for chemokines. There are 19 such receptors that are differentially expressed on leukocyt es: the repertoire of receptor expression depending on the type of leukocyte and its stage in maturation. From observ ations in animal models , clinical studies, in vitro cell biology, and molecular analysis, a worki ng hypothesis has been esta blished to explain the cellular interactions underlying allergic responses and the ch emokines-chemokine receptors involved. Chemokines signal through G protein-coupl ed receptors that are used typically for sensory functions (eg, detection of olfactory signals in th e nose). This type of receptor can be blocked selectively by small-molecule antagoni sts. This provides the opportunity for the development of therapeutic compounds designed to suppress the recruitment of particular leukocyte types in a llergic reactions. REVIEW: Charo IF The Many Roles of Chemokines and Ch emokine Receptors in Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are small heparin-binding proteins that direct the movement of circulating leukocytes to sites of inflammation or inju ry. During the eight years since chemokines and chemokine receptors were last reviewed in the Journal,1 a vast expansion in the understanding of chemokine biology has occurred. Originally studied because of their role in inflammation, chemokines and their receptors are now known to play a crucial pa rt in directing the movement of mononuclear cells throughout the body, engenderi ng the adaptive immune response and contributing to the pathogene sis of a variety of diseases. Chemokine receptors are some of the most tractable drug targets in the huge battery of molecules that regulate inflammation and immunity. For this reason, clinical trials involving chemokine-receptor antagonists for the treatment of inflamma tory conditions have recently begun. In this review, we survey the properties of chemokines and their receptors and highlight the roles of these chemoattractants in selected clinical disorders. REVIEW: Allen SJ Chemokines: receptor structure, interactions, and antagonism. Annu Rev Immunol. 2007;25:787-820. Chemokines are critical m ediators of cell mi gration during routine immune surveillance, inflammation, and development. Chemokines bind to G protein-coupled receptors and cause conformational changes that trigger intracellula r signaling pathways invo lved in cell movement 63and activation. Although chemokines evolved to benefit the host, inappropriate regulation or utilization of these proteins can contribute to or cause ma ny diseases. Specific chemokine receptors provide the portals for HIV to get into cells, and others contribute to inflammatory diseases and cancer. Thus, there is significant inte rest in developing receptor antagonists. To this end, the structures of ligands coupled with muta genesis studies have revealed mechanisms for antagonism based on modified protei ns. Although little direct structur al information is available on the receptors, binding of small mol ecules to mutant receptors has al lowed the identification of key residues involved in the receptor-binding pockets . In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of chemokine:receptor structure and function, and its contribution to drug discovery. REVIEW: Ziegler S.

Cytokines are involved in nearly every facet of immunity and inflammation, from induction of the innate immune response to the generation of cytotoxic T cells and the development of antibodies by the humoral immune system.

For th is update, recent advances in our understanding of cytokines will be discussed, which includes the IL-10, IL-17, and IL-27 families. REVIEW: Chung EK. Antenatal risk factors, cytokines and the development of atopic disease in early childhood. Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed 2007;92:F68-73 Atopic diseases are complex entities influenced by an array of risk factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental allergens, antenatal exposures, infections and psychosocial factors. One proposed mechanism by which these risk fact ors contribute to the development of atopic disease is through changes in the production of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) and T helper cell type 2 (Th2) cytokines. The objectives of this review are to discuss antenatal exposures that are associated with paediatric atopic diseases, to disc uss the influence of the intrauterine environment on neonatal immune responses, to provide an overv iew of the Th1 and Th2 pathways and how they relate to atopic disease, and to summarise our current understanding of the association between cytokine responses in cord blood and the deve lopment of atopic dis ease in early childhood. 64 g. Growth factors REVIEW: M\u00f6hle R Hematopoietic grow th factors for hematopoie tic stem cell mobilization and expansion. Semin Hematol. 2007;44:193-202. During inflammation and cytopenia, increased leve ls growth factors (HPGFs) induce m obilization prolifera hematopoietic and hematopoietic progenitor cells resulting in spatia l and quantitative in vivo expansi on of the hematopoietic tissue. Exogenous administration of recombinant HPGFs, particularly granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), is routine for mobilizati on of stem cells, followed by collection and transplantation of autologous or allogeneic stem cells. In this review, we summarize experience using different HPGFs and HPGF combinations for stem cell mobilization, such as G-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), stem cell factor (SCF), and others. Preclinic al and clinical studies of so-called early- and late-acting HPGFs for ex vivo expansion of HPCs are discussed, also with respect to the unresolved question whether expansion of repopulating stem cells can be achieved in vitro.

Receptor Ligand interactions in functioning\u2014signal transduction resulting from receptor cell-mediated allergic inflammation. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2007;120:238-44 It was demonstrated 5 years romal lymphopoietin (TSLP) , a IL-7-like cytokine coul d strongly activate human myeloid dendritic cells to induce an inflammatory T(H)2 response characterized by high TNF-alpha and little IL-10 production, distinct from the regulatory T(H)2 responses characterized by low TN F-alpha and high IL-10 production. TSLP was found highly ssed by keratinocytes of skin lesions of atopic dermatitis and associated with dendritic cell activation in situ. This suggests for the first time that TSLP represents a master switch of allergic inflam mation at the epithelial cell and dendritic cell interface. During the last several years, the ev idence for the association of TSLP with human asthma was revealed. The direct link between TS LP expression with the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and asthma in vivo was demonstrate d. In addition, OX40 ligand was found to be the 65TSLP-induced molecule on dendritic cells that tri ggers inflamm atory T(H)2 differentiation in the absence of IL-12. TSLP was also demonstrated to direct the innate pha se of allergic immune responses through activating mast cells. Ther efore, TSLP and OX40 ligand may represent important targets for intervention of the ini tiation of allergic in flammatory responses. REVIEW: Kambayashi T Proximal signaling events in Fc mast cell activation J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2007;119:544-52 Mast cells are central mediato rs of allergic dise ases. Their involvement in allergic reactions is largely dependent on activation thro ugh the specific receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon of Fc epsilon RI on mast cells initiates a cascade of signaling events that eventually results in degranulation, cytokine/chemokine production, and leukotriene releas e, contributing to allergic symptomology. Because of the importance of IgE in allergy, much focus has been placed on deciphering the signaling events that take place downstream of Fc epsilon RI. Studies have identified spleen tyrosine key proximal regulator of Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling. In this review, we discuss the multiple pathways that diverge from spleen tyrosine kinase with emphasis on the role of adapter molecules to orchestrate these signaling events. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying mast cell activation ideally will provide insights into the development of novel therapeutics to control allergic disease REVIEW: Trinchieri G Cooperation of Toll-like receptor signals in innate immune defence Nature Rev Immunol. 2007;7:179-90 The mechanisms by which the recognition of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands leads to host immunity remain poorly defined. It is now thought that to induce an effective immune response, microorganisms must stimulate complex sets of pattern-recognition recept ors, both within and outside of the TLR family. The combined activation of these different receptors can result in complementary, synergistic or antagonistic effects that modulate innate and adaptive immunity. Therefore, a complete understanding of the role of TLRs in host resistan ce to infection requires 'decoding' of these multiple recepto r interactions. This review highlights recent advances in the newly emerging field of TLR cooperation and discu sses their implications for the development of adjuvants and immunotherapies. REVIEW: Schwartz DA Polymorphisms of the Toll-like receptors and human disease Clin Infect Dis. 2005;41:S403-7 The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family regulates both innate and adaptive immune responses. Given its broad effect on immunity, the function of TLRs in various human diseases has been investigated largely by compar ing the incidence of disease among persons with different polymorphisms in the genes that participate in TLR signaling. These studies demonstrate that TLR function affects several diseases, including seps is, immunodeficiencies, atherosclerosis, and asthma.

Increasing understanding of these molecular defects has considerably influenced both basic and translational research, and this has extended to many branches of medicine. Recent advances in both diagnosis and therapeutic modalities have allowed these defects to be id entified earlier and to be more precisely defined, and they have also re sulted in more promising long-term outcomes.

In this review we summarize the leukocyte recruitment cascade, highlighting the molecular mechanisms that underlie each of the major steps. Major emphasis is placed on the selectins and integr ins and their role in rolling and adhesion. Intraluminal crawling and emigration are also briefly discussed. In addition, we summarize some of the data that implicate these molecules in eo sinophil recruitment in anim al models of asthma and in lymphocyte recruitment in skin contact sensitivity.

The discovery of new functions for the origin al B7 fam ily members, together with the identification of additional B7 and CD28 family members, have revealed new ways in which the B7:CD28 family regulates T cell activation and tolerance. B7-1/B7-2:CD28 interactions not only promote initial T cell activation but also regu late self-tolerance by supporting CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell homeostasis. CTLA-4 can exert its inhibitory effects in both B7-1/B7-2 dependent and independent fashions.

The new CD28 families members, ICOS, PD-1, and BTLA, are inducibly expressed on T cells, and they have important roles in regulating previously activated T cells. PD-1 and BTLA also are expressed on B cells and may have broader immunoregulatory func tions. The ICOS:ICOSL pathway appears to be particularly important for stimulating effect or T cell responses and T cell-dependent B cell responses, but it also has an important role in re gulating T cell tolerance. In addition, the PD-1:PD- L1/PD-L2 pathway plays a critical role in regulating T cell activation and tolerance. In this review, we revisit the roles of the B7 :CD28 family members in regula ting immune responses, and we discuss their therapeutic potential. CLINICAL RESEARCH FRONTIER: Suntharalingam G Cytokine Storm in a Phase 1 Trial of th e Anti-CD28 Monoclonal Antibody TGN1412 N Engl J Med 2006; 355:1018-1028 Six healthy young male volunteers at a contract research organization were enrolled in the first phase 1 clinical trial of TGN1412, a novel superagonist anti -CD28 monoclonal antibody that directly stimulates T cells. With in 90 minutes after receiving a si ngle intravenous dose of the drug, all six volunteers had a systemic inflammatory response characterized by a rapid induction of proinflammatory cytokines and accompanied by headache, myalgias, nausea, diarrhea, erythema, vasodilatation, and hypotension. Within 12 to 16 hour s after infusion, they became critically ill, with pulmonary infiltrates and lung injury, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Severe and unexpected depletion of lymphocytes a nd monocytes occurred within 24 hours after infusion. All six patients were transferred to the care of the authors at an intensive care unit at a public hospital, where they receive d intensive cardiopulmonary support (including dialysis), high-dose methylprednisolone, and an anti-interleukin-2 re ceptor antagonist antibody. Prolonged cardiovascular shock and acute respiratory distress syndr ome developed in two patients, who required intensive organ support for 8 and 16 da ys. Despite evidence of the multiple cytokine- release syndrome, all six patients survived.

METHODS: Intercellular adhesion molecule 3 by a mAb that recognizes an ICAM-3 epitope that binds its ligand, CD11a/CD18. In some experiments with eosinophils, recombinant human IL-5 or GM-CSF was added to ICAM-3 increased apoptosis of both eosinophils (18 and 48 hours) and neutrophils (18 hours) . At 18 hours, eosinophil apoptosi s increased from 31.4% \u00b1 3.5 SE 45.2% 4.1 control) to 55.3% \u00b1 4.5 (an ti-ICAM-3). At 48 hours, eosinophil apoptosis increased 2-fold under baseline conditions and also in the presence of recombinant human IL-5 or GM-CSF. In both eosinophils and neutrophils, in cubation a antibody against CD18 integrins blunted ICAM-3-induced apoptosis. In eosinophils, blocking peptides for caspases 8 and 9, proteases critical to apoptos is, also decreased ICAM-3-induced apoptosis to control levels. CONCLUSION: its effect on eosinophil a nd neutrophil apoptosis, ICAM-3 may be an important anti-inflammatory molecule that can oppose the proinflammatory effects of IL-5 and GM-CSF. CLINICAL IMPLCATIONS: These fi ndings provide a mechanism for apoptotic clearance of eosinophils and neutro phils involved in allergic inflammation that, unlike necrosis, does not cause nonspecific tissue injury. 10. Immunologic Memory REVIEW: Anderson SM Intrinsic properties of human and murine memory B cells. Immunol Rev 2006;211:280-94 The central question of how the immune system responds in a qualitatively and quantitatively better way upon re-exposure to a pathogen is larg ely unanswered. Both the increased frequency of antigen-specific memory cells and the intrinsic pr operties that memory cells acquire after antigen experience could contribute to the faster and more robust responses seen af ter repeated exposure to antigen. In the case of the memory B-cell response, it has been diffi cult to discern the individual contributions of these two effects. However, because of recent advances in identifying memory B cells, there is an increasing unders tanding of the intrinsic properti es of these ce lls. The current 69insights into the unique properties of me mory B cells and th e progress that has been made in understanding how these affect secondary response s in both the human and the mouse systems are discussed. In addition, we compare the various advantages and disadva ntages inherent in each of these systems, in terms of studying the intrinsi c properties of memory B cells, and introduce the details of the system that we have developed using conventional heavy ch ain transgenic (Tgic) mice, which addresses some of the drawbacks of traditional memory models. REVIEW: Tangye SG Human IgM+CD27+ B cells: memory B cells or \"memory\" B cells?. J Immunol 2007;179:13-9 Memory B cells are generated in germinal centers (GC) and contribute to serological immunity by rapidly differentiating into plasma cells. Hu man memory B cells can be identified by the expression of CD27. These cells exhibit more rapid responses than naive (CD27-) B cells following stimulation in vitro, consis tent with the heightened kineti cs of secondary responses in vivo. CD27+ B cells express mutated Ig V region ge nes; however a signifi cant proportion continue to express IgM, suggesting the existence of IgM+ memory B cells. The observation that mutated IgM+CD27+ B cells are generated in humans who cannot form GC led to the conclusions that these cells are generated independently of GC and thus are not memory cells and that they mediate responses to T cell-independent Ag. Although some studies suppor t the idea that IgM+CD27+ B cells participate in T cell-independent respons es, many others do not. In this review we will provide alternate interp retations of the biology of IgM+CD27+ B cells and propose that they are indeed memory cells. KEY CLINICAL RESEARCH Amanna IJ. Duration of humoral immunity to common viral and vaccine antigens. N Engl J Med 2007;357:1903-15 BACKGROUND: Maintenance of long-term antibody res ponses is critical for protective immunity against many pathogens. However, the duration of humoral immunity and the role played by memory B cells remain poorly defined. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal analysis of antibody titers specific for viral antigens (vaccinia, measles, mu virus, and Epstein-Barr virus) and nonreplicating antigens (tetanus and diphtheria) in 45 subjects for a period of up to 26 years. In addition, we measured antigen-specific memory B cells by means of limiting-dilution analysis, and we compared me mory B-cell frequencies to their corresponding serum antibody levels. RESULTS: Antiviral antibody re sponses were remarkably stable, with half- lives ranging from an estimated 50 years for varicel la-zoster virus to more than 200 years for other viruses such as measles and mumps. Antibody re sponses against tetanus and diphtheria antigens waned more quickly, with estimated half-lives of 11 years and 19 years, respectively. B-cell memory was long-lived, but there was no signi ficant correlation between peripheral memory B- cell numbers and antibody levels for five of the eight antigens tested. CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide quantitative analysis of serologic memory for multiple antigens in subjects followed longitudinally over the course of more than one decade. In cases in which multiple exposures or repeated vaccinations were common , memory B-cell numbers did not correlate with antibody titers. This finding suggests that peripheral memory B cells and antibody-secreting 70plasma cells m ay represent independently regulat ed cell populations and ma y play different roles in the maintenance of protective immunity REVIEW: Prlic M Requirements for CD8 Curr Opin Immunological memory is characterized by the ab ility to provide protection from secondary exposure to pathogens. CD8(+) memory T cells pr ovide protection from cel l-associated antigens owing to their elevated frequency, rapid response and localization to site s of infection. Events occurring during primary exposure to antigen can impact not only th e magnitude and quality of the initial cytotoxic T lymphocyte response but also the efficacy and longevity of the ensuing CD8(+) memory pool. Recent advances shed light on the re lative roles of TCR sign als and environmental cues in guiding the development of CD8(+) effector T cells into CD8(+) memory T cells and supporting CD8(+) memory T-cell maintenance. REVIEW: Fazilleau N Local development of cells. Curr Opin Immunol 2007;19:259-67 Clonal evolution underpins immunity. In partic ular, antigen -specific helper T (Th) cell development is central to high-affinity B cell immun ity and protective vaccination. Dendritic cell maturation and TCR affinity-based selection mechanisms control the recruitment and effective propagation of preferred antigen-specific Th cell cohorts in local lymphoid tissue. Importantly, follicular B helper T (T(FH)) cells emer ge as the specialized local effector Th cells that orchestrate the stepwise development of B ce ll immunity in these local environments. Recent studies also introduce the role of persistent antigen in the development of effector Th cells with evidence for long-term antigen depots that might contribute to local an tigen-specific Th cell memory. REVIEW: Ndejembi MP . Reshaping the responses 2007; 122:1-12 Memory T cells are generated foll owing an initial encounter with antigen, persist over the lifetime of an individual, and mediate rapid and robust functi onal responses upon antig enic recall. While immune memory is generally associated with pr otective immune response to pathogens, memory T cells can be generated to diverse types of antigens including autoan tigens and alloantigens through homologous or crossreactive priming and comprise the majority of circulating T cells during adulthood. Memory T cells can therefore play cr itical roles in propagating and perpetuating autoimmune disease and in mediating allograf t rejection, although the precise pathways for regulation of memory immune responses remain largely undefined. Moreover, evaluating and designing strategies to modulate memory T-cell responses are challenging given the remarkable heterogeneity of memory T cells, with different subsets predominating in lymphoid versus non- lymphoid tissue sites. In this review, we discuss what is presently known regarding the effect of 71current immunomodulation strategies on the me mory T-cell compartment and potential strategies for controlling immunological recall. REVIEW: Williams MA Effector and Memory CTL Differentiation Ann Rev Immunol 2007;25:171-192 Technological advances in recent years have allo wed for an ever-expanding ability to analyze and vivo immune responses. MHC tetramers, intracellular cytokine staining, an increasing repertoire of transgenic and \"knockout\" mice, and the detailed characterization of a variety of infectious models have all facilit ated more precise and definitive analyses of the generation and function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Understanding the mechanisms behind the differentiation of effector and memory CTL is of increasing importance to develop vaccination strategies against a variety of established and emerging infecti ous diseases. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of how effector and memory CTL differentiate and survive in vivo in response to vira l or bacterial infection REVIEW: Woodfolk J T-cell responses to allergens. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2007;119:280-94 The allergic response in human beings is neered by CD4(+) T lymphocytes, which secrete T(H)2 cytokines response to activation by alle rgen-derived peptides. Although T(H)2 cells have been well characterized, defining th e properties of allergen-specifi c T cells has proved challenging in human beings because of their low frequency within the T-cell repertoire. However, recent studies have provided insight in to the molecular signature of long-lived human memory T(H)2 cells, which are allergen-specific. T-cell responses directed against allergens develop in early life and are heavily influenced by the type and dose of allergen, and possibly coexposure to microbial products. These responses are su sceptible to suppression by regulatory T cells. This article highlights recent advances in the characterizatio n of allergen-specific memory T(H)2 cells and discusses the heterogeneous nature of regulator y T cells and possible mechanisms of action. The relevance of T-cell epitope mapping studies to unde rstanding the unique nature of T-cell responses to different allergens, as well as to peptide vaccine development, is reviewed. Experimental techniques and approaches for analyzing allergen-specific T ce lls and identifying novel T-cell epitopes are described that may lead to new T-cell-based therapies. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Bosco A Identification of novel Th2-associated ge nes in T memory responses to allergens. J Immunol 2006; 176:4766-77 Atopic diseases of Th2 cy tokines by allergen-specific T memory cells. However, clinical trials with rece ntly developed Th2 inhibitors in atopics have proven disappointing, suggesting u nderlying complexities in atopy pathogenesis which are not satisfactorily explained via the cl assical Th1/Th2 paradigm. One likel y possibility is that additional Th2-associated genes which are central to disease pathogenesis remain unidentified. The aim of the present study was to identify such novel Th2- associated genes in recall responses to the 72inhalant allergen house dust mite. In contrast to earlier human microarray studies in atopy which focused on mitogen-activated T cell lines and clon es, we concentrated on PBMC-derived primary T cells stimulated under more physiological co nditions of low dose allergen exposure. We screened initially for allergen-induced gene activ ation by microarray, and validated novel genes in independent panels of subjects by quantitative RT-PCR. Kinetic anal ysis of allergen responses in PBMC revealed an early wave of novel atopy-associated genes involved in signaling which were coexpressed with IL-4 and IL-4R, followed by a later wave of genes en coding the classical Th2 effector cytokines. We further demonstrate th at these novel activation- associated Th2 genes up- regulate in response to another at opy-associated physiological stimul us bacterial superantigen, but remain quiescent in nonphysiologica l responses in primary T cells or cell lines driven by potent mitogens, which may account for their failure to be detected in earlier microarray studies. C. Mucosal Immunity REVIEW: Tosi, MF Innate immune to infection. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2005; 116(2): 241-9; quiz 250 This articles reviews the prot ective mechanisms that do not depend on specific antigenic recognition (adaptive immunity) and allow the host to survive infec tious challenges. Antimicrobial peptides are released at epithelial surfaces and disrupt the membranes of many microbial pathogens. Toll-like receptors on ep ithelial cells and leukocytes recognize a range of microbial molecular patterns and generate in tracellular signals fo r activation of a range of host responses. Cytokines released from leukocytes and other cells exhibit a vast array of regulatory functions in both adaptive and innate immunity. Chemokines re leased from infected tissues recruit diverse populations of leukocytes that expr ess distinct chemokine receptors . Natural killer cells recognize and bind virus-infected host cells and tumor cells and induce their apoptosis. Complement, through the alternative and mannose-bind migrate from the microcirculation into infected tissue and ingest and kill invading micr obes. These innate immune mechanisms and their interactions in defense against infection provide the host with th e time needed to mobilize the more slowly developing mechanisms of adaptive immunity, which might protect against subsequent challenges.

The complement system comprises a strong defe nse against various path ogens and is a major component of our innate immune system. While earlier studies have established a crucial role of complement in recognition, opsonization and enhanced phagocytosis of microorganisms by professional phagocytes such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, recent studies 74delineate an additional role of complem ent in initiation and maintenance of the acquired immune response. In addition, it seems th at opsonization of apoptotic cells by complement may lead to polarization of the response of professional antigen-presenting cel ls to a more inflammatory or tolerogenic response. The present review summarizes these different contributions of complement to the shaping of the immune balance.

REVIEW: MacDonald TT, Gordon JN Bacterial regulation of intestinal immune responses Gastroenterol Clin North Am 2005; 34:401-412 The mucosal immune system of healthy individual s is a host response to the commensal bacterial flora. The presence of the flora must alter epithe lial and immune function in the gut, and immune responses to nominal antigens occur in an environment where products of the flora are controlling dendritic cell function. This review describes th e cross-talk between the commensal flora and the mucosal immune system giving insight into why tolerance develops and why inappropriate responses to the flora may lead to pathology. 1. Adaptive Immunity a. Responses to bacteria viruses and parasites REVIEW: Palmer EG. Immune response to commensal and environmental microbes. Nature Immunology 2007;8:1173-1178. The mammalian immune system discriminates among microbes, inactiva ting pathogens while tolerating colonization by commensal organisms. Calibrating immune responses to microbes on this basis, however, is complex, as microbial virulence is often context dependent, being influenced by the host's immune status and the microbial milieu. Many microbial pathogens infecting immunocompromised hosts, for exam ple, are innocuous in immune-competent individuals, and other microbes cause disease only when the commensal flora is compromised by antibiotic therapy. Recent studies have begun to reveal how the immune system tips the balance in favor of some microbes, allowing commensals to persist on mucosal surfaces The host gastroin testinal tract is exposed to countless numbers of foreign antigens and has embedded a unique and complex network of i mmunological and non-immunological mechanisms, often termed the gastrointestinal 'mucosal barr ier', to protect the host from potentially harmful pathogens while at the same time 'tolerating' other resident microbes to allow absorption and utilization of nutrients. Of the ma ny important roles of this barrier , it is the distinct responsibility of the mucosal immune system to sample and discriminate between harmful and beneficial antigens and to prevent entry of food-borne pathogen s through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This system comprises an immunological network termed the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) that consists of unique arrangements of B cells , T cells and phagocytes which sample luminal antigens through specialized epithelia termed the follicle associated epithelia (FAE) and orchestrate co-ordinated molecular responses between immune cells and other components of the mucosal barrier. Certain pathogens have develo ped ways to bypass and/or withstand defence by the mucosal immune system to establish disease in the host. Some 'opportunistic' pathogens (such as Clostridium difficile) take advantage of host or other factors (diet, stre ss, antibiotic use) which may alter or weaken the response of the imm une system. Other pathogens have developed mechanisms for invading gastrointestinal ep ithelium and evading phagocytosis/destruction by immune system defences. Once cellular invasion o ccurs, host responses are activated to limit local mucosal damage and repel the foreign influence. Some pathogens (Shige lla spp, parasites and viruses) primarily establish localized disease while others (Salmonella, Yersinia, Listeria) use the lymphatic system to enter organs or the bloodstream and cause more systemic illness. In some cases, pathogens (Helicobacter pylori and Salmonella typhi) colonize the GI tract or associated lymphoid structures for extended periods of time and these persistent pathogens may also be potential triggers for other chronic or inflam matory diseases, includ ing inflammatory bowel disease and malignancies. The abilit y of certain pathogens to avoid or withstand the host's immune assault and/or utilize these host responses to their own advantage (i.e. enhance further colonization) will dictate the pathogen's succe ss in promoting illness and furthering its own survival. b. Mucosal Immunoglobulins REVIEW: Brandtzaeg P. Induction of Vaccine 2007;25:5467-5484. Mucosal epithelia comprise an extensive vulne rable barrier which is reinforced by numerous innate defence mechanisms cooperating intimately with adaptive immunity. Local generation of secretory IgA (SIgA) constitutes the largest humoral immune system of the body. Secretory antibodies function both by performing antigen exclusion at mucosal surfaces and by virus and endotoxin neutralization within ep ithelial cells without causing tissue damage. SIgA is thus persistently containing commensal bacteria outside the epithelial barrier but can also target invasion of pathogens and penetrat ion of harmful antigens. Resistan Esch erichia coli appears to depend largely on SIgA, and so does herd protection against horizontal fa ecal-oral spread of ente ric pathogens under na\u00efve or immunized conditions\u2014with a substantial inna te impact both on cross-reactivity and memory. Like natural infections, live mucosal vaccines or adequate co mbinations of non-replicating vaccines and mucosal adjuvants, give rise not on ly to SIgA antibodies but also to longstanding 76serum IgG and IgA responses. However, there is cons ider ably disparity with regard to migration of memory/effector cells from mucosa l inductive sites to secretory effector sites and systemic immune organs. Also, although i mmunological memory is generate d after mucosal priming, this may be masked by a self-limiting response protecti ng the inductive lymphoid tissue in the gut. The intranasal route of vaccine application targe ting nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue may be more advantageous for certain infections, but only if successful stimulation is achieved without the use of toxic adjuvants that might reach the cen tral nervous system. The degree of protection obtained after mucosal vaccination ranges from reduc tion of symptoms to complete inhibition of re-infection. In this s cenario, it is often difficult to determ ine the relative importance of SIgA versus serum antibodies, but infection models in knockout mice strongly support the notion that SIgA exerts a decisive role in protection and cross-protection agains t a variety of infectious agents. Nevertheless, relatively few muco sal vaccines have been approved for human use, and more basic work is needed in vaccine and adjuvant design, including particul ate or to their vast surface area, the mucosal surfaces of the body represent a major site of potential attack by invading pathogens. The s ecretions that bathe mucosal surfaces contain significant levels of immunoglobulins (Igs), which play key roles in immune defense of these surfaces. IgA is the predominant antibody class in many external secretions and has many functional attributes, both direct and indirect, that serve to prevent infect ive agents such as bacteria and viruses from breaching the mucosal barrier. This review detail s current understanding of the structural and functional characteristics of IgA, including in teraction with specific receptors (such as Fc RI, Fc/\u00b5R, and CD71) and presents examples of th e means by which certain pathogens circumvent the protective properties of this important Ig. i. Secretory IgA REVIEW: Suzuki K, Ha S, Tsuji M, Fagarasan S. Intestinal IgA synthesis: A primitive form of adaptive immunity that regulates microbial communities in the gut. Seminars in Immunology 2007;19:127-135 Our intestine is colonized by an impressive community of bacteria that has profound effects on the immune functions. The relationshi p between gut microbiota and th e immune system is one of reciprocity: bacteria have important contribution in nutrient processing and education of the immune system and conversely, the immune system, particularly gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) plays a key role in shapi ng the repertoire of gut microbiota. In this review we discuss new insights into the role of IgA in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and the reciprocal interactions between gut B ce lls and intestinal bacteria. REVIEW: Pilette C. Ouadrhiri Y. Godding V. et al. Lung : im munoglobulin-A revisited 77Eur Respir J 2001;18:571-88. Mucosal defence mechanism s are critical in preventing colonization of the respiratory tract by pathogens and penetration of antigens through the epithelial barrier. Recent research has now illustrated the active contribution of the respiratory epithelium to the exclusion of microbes and particles, but also to the control of the inflammatory and immune responses in the airways and in the alveoli. Epithelial cells al so mediate the active transport of polymeric immunoglobulin-A from the lamina propria to the airway lumen through the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor. The role of IgA in the defence of mucosal surfaces has now expanded from a limited role of scavenger of exogenous material to a broader protective function with poten tial applications in immunotherapy. In addition, the recen t identification of receptors for IgA on the surface of blood leukocytes and alveolar macrophages provides an additional mechanism of interaction between the cellular and humoral immune systems at the level of the respiratory tract. ii. Ig Transport RESEARCH FRONTIER: Hongxing L. Nowak-Wegrzyn A. Charlop-Powers Z. et al. Transcytosis of IgE-antigen complexes by CD23a in human intestinal epithelial cells and its role in food allergy Gastroenterology 2006;131:47-58 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Secreted immunoglobulins play an integral role in host defense at mucosal surfaces, and recent evidence shows that Ig G can participate in antigen sampling from the intestinal lumen. We examined whether IgE also could facilitate transepithelial antigen sampling. METHODS: Stool samples from food-allergic patients undergoi ng oral food challenge were analyzed for CD23 and food-specific IgE. CD23 is oform expression on primary human intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) was analyz ed by polymerase chain reaction. The role of CD23 isoforms in transcytosis of antigen and Ig E-antigen complexes was assessed using polarized human T84 cells retrovirally with on IECs, and food-allergic patients ha d increased levels of soluble CD23 and food-specific IgE in the stool after challenge. CD23a, but not CD23b, was expressed by primary human IECs. We show in transcytosis assays that CD23a , but not CD23b, acts as a bidirec tional transporter of IgE. In addition, specific IgE facilitated the uptake of an tigen from the apical su rface of an epithelial monolayer by diverting antigen from delivery to lysosomes. Finally, delivery of antigen-IgE complexes across the epithelial barrier could i nduce the degranulation of rat basophil leukemia cells transfected with the human high-affinity IgE receptor. CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that CD23a is expressed normally on human IECs, a nd in the presence of IgE can function as an antigen-sampling mechanism capable of activating subepithelial mast cells. IgE may serve as a secretory immunoglobulin that in concert with CD23 participates in food-induced pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal tract. REVIEW: Rojas R. Apodaca G. Immunoglobulin transport across polarized epithelial cells Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology 2202;3:944-55 IgA, IgG and IgM are transporte d across epithelial ce lls in a receptor-mediated process known as transcytosis. In addition to neutra lizing pathogens in the lumen of the gastrointestinal, respiratory and urogenital tracts, these antibody-receptor comp lexes are now known to mediate intracellular 78neutralization of pathogens and migh t also be important in immune activation and tolerance. Recent studies on the intracellular transport pathways of antibody-receptor complexes and antibody-stimulated receptor-mediated transcytosis are providing new insight into the nature and regulation of endocytic pathways. iii. Fcy function REVIEW: Yoshida M. Masuda Kobayashi T. al. IgG transport across mucosal barriers by neonatal Fc Mucosal secretions of the human gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genital tr acts contain significant quantities of IgG. The neonatal Fc receptor for Ig G (FcRn) plays a major role in regulating host IgG levels and transporting IgG and associated antigens across polarized epithelial barriers. The FcRn can then recycle the IgG/antigen complex back across the intestinal barrier into the lamina propria for processing by dendritic cells and presentation to CD4 + T cells in regional organized lymphoid structures. FcRn, through its ability to s ecrete and absorb IgG, thus integrates luminal antigen encounters with systemic immune comp artments and, as such, provides essential host defense and immunoregulatory functions at the mucosal surfaces. iv. Mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) REVIEW: Garside P. Millington O. Smith KM The anatomy of mucosal immune responses. Ann N Y Acad Sci 2004;1029:9-15 It remains unclear how and where unresponsiven ess to fed antigens is induced. This \"oral tolerance\" is probably necessary to prevent the array of immune effector mechanisms required to counteract pathogens of the mucosae from being misdirected against food antigens or commensal flora. It will obviously be important to disse ct where, when, and how such immunological homeostasis is maintained in the gut, but it will also be necessary to determine whether similar inductive and effector mechanisms are required fo r the therapeutic applica tions of oral tolerance systemically. This may be influenced by anatomical and microenvironmental effects on the phenotype and/or activation state of the antigen-presenting cell (APC), which presents orally delivered antigen. Fed antigen passes from the inte stinal lumen either via the villus epithelium and M cells in the Peyer's patches (PP) or the mu cosal lamina propria to the organized lymphoid tissues of the PP and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). In addition, th ere is evidence that mucosally administered antigen also gains access directly to peri pheral lymphoid organs. Each of these sites contains distinctive populations of APCs and has unique local microenvironments that may influence the immune response in different ways . We propose that feeding antigen in high doses may induce clonal anergy, deletion, or altered diffe rentiation because it gains direct access to resting APCs in the T cell areas of both th e gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) and peripheral lymphoid organs, w ith presentation occurring in the absence of productive costimulation. By contrast, low doses of tole rizing antigen may be taken up and presented preferentially by APCs in the GALT, where the local environment may fa vor the induction of regulatory T cells. This is consistent with our ow n and others findings, using adoptive transfer of TcR tg T cells. These studies have shown that antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells are activated 79simultaneously in all peripheral and gut-associated lym phoid organs after feeding high doses of proteins, but that this may be mo re restricted to local tissues when lower doses are used. Another level of anatomical control is imposed within ly mphoid organs, where migration of T cells through distinct anatomical compartments can affect their differentiation. We find that, in contrast to orally primed T cells, orally tolerized T cells are unable to migrate into B cell follicles during their initial exposure to antigen. This affects their differentia tion as upon subsequent chal lenge with antigen in adjuvant, tolerized T cells can be found in follicles but are unable to provide the B cell help that primed T cells can deliver. We hypothesize that the initial defective migrati on of tolerized T cells prevents them from receiving signals from antigen -specific B cells in follicles and results in abortive differentiation. Thus, both gross and fine anatomical location of fed antigen presentation may be important in mucosal immunoregulation. REVIEW: Kunisawa J.

REVIEW: Knop E. Knop N. The role of eye-associated lymphoid tissue in corneal immune protection. J. Anat. 2005;206:271-285 Because the cornea is optimized for refraction, it relies on supporting tissues for moistening and nutrition and in particular for immune protectio n. Its main support tissue is the conjunctiva, in addition to the lacrimal gland, the latter which pr ovides soluble mediators via the tear film. The cornea and conjunctiva constitute a moist mucosa l surface and there is increasing evidence that apart from innate defence mechanisms, also lym phoid cells contribute to the normal homeostasis of the corneal surface. A Medline-based literature search was pe rformed in order to review the existing literature on the existence, compositi on and functions of muco sa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) at the ocular surface for corneal pr otection. The existence of lymphoid cells at the ocular surface and appendage has been known for many years, but for a long time they were believed erroneously to be inflammatory cells. More recent research has show n that in addition to the known presence of lymphoid cells in the la crimal gland, they also form MALT in the conjunctiva as conjunctiva -associated lymphoid tissue (CALT) as lacrimal drainage-associated tissue lymphoid tissue (EALT) , which is a new component of the mucosal immune system of the body. When the topographical distribution of CALT is projected onto the ocular surface, it overlies the cornea during eye closure and is henc e in a suitable position to assist the corneal immune protection during blinki ng and overnight. It can detect corneal antigens and prime respective effector cells, or distribute protective fa ctors as secretory IgA. 2. Passive immunization REVIEW: Hanson L. Feeding and infant development. B reast-feeding and immune function Proceedings of the Nutrition Society 2007;66:384-396 The newborn receives, via the placenta, maternal IgG antibodies against the microbes present in its surroundings, but such antibodies have a pro-in flammatory action, initiating the complement system and phagocytes. Although the host defence mechanisms of the neonate that involve inflammatory reactivity are somewh at inefficient, this defence sy stem can still have catabolic effects. Breast-feeding compensates for this relative inefficiency of host defence in the neonate by providing considerable amounts of secretory IgA antibodies direct ed particularly against the microbial flora of the mother and her environmen t. These antibodies bind the microbes that are appearing on the infant's mucosal membranes, preventing activation of the pro-inflammatory defence. The major milk protein lactoferrin can destroy microbes and reduce inflammatory responses. The non-absorbed milk oligosaccharides block attachment of microbes to the infant's mucosae, preventing infections. The milk may contain anti-secretory f actor, which is anti- inflammatory, preventing mastitis in mothers and diarrhoea in infants. Numerous additional factors in the milk are of unknown function, although IL-7 is linked to the larger size of the thymus and the enhanced development of intestinal T lymphocytes in breast-fed compared with non-breast- fed infants. Several additional components in the milk may help to explain why breast-feeding can reduce infant mortality, protecting against neonata l septicaemia and meningitis. It is therefore important to start breast-feeding immediately. Pr otection is also apparent against diarrhoea, respiratory infections and otitis media. There may be protection against urin ary tract infections and necrotizing enterocolitis, and possibly also against allergy and certain other immunological diseases, and tumours. In conclusion, breast-feeding provides a very broad multifactorial anti-inflammatory defence for the infant. REVIEW: Englund JA. The influence of maternal immuniza tion on infant immune responses J. Comp. Path. 2007;137:S16-S19 The vaccination of human mothers during pregnanc y leads to transplacental transfer of antibody which can provide protection to the neonate during early life. This active transfer is a receptor- mediated event with preferential transport of antibody of the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses via the FcR n receptor. The efficiency of trans-placental transfer is dependent on a range of factors including: placental integrity, the total IgG concentration in matern al blood, the type of vaccine, the timing of vaccine administration during gestati on, the gestational age of the fetus at birth and the IgG subclass involved. The ki netics of maternal and infant serological responses has been extensively studied using Haemophilus infl uenzae b (Hib) vaccination as a model. 81D.

Tumor Immunology REVIEW: Derhovanessian E, Solana R, Labri G Immunity, ageing, and cancer Immunity & Ageing 2008; 5: 11 Compromised immunity contributes to the decreased ability of the elderly to control infectious disease and to their generally poor response to vacc ination. It is controversial as to how far this phenomenon contributes to the well-known age-asso ciated increase in the occurrence of many cancers in the elderly. However, sh ould the immune system be impor tant in controlling cancer, for which there is a great deal of ev idence, it is logical to propose th at dysfunctional im munity in the elderly would contribute to compromised immuno surveillance and increased cancer occurrence. The chronological age at which immunosenescence b ecomes clinically important is known to be influenced by many factors, including the pat hogen load to which individuals are exposed throughout life. It is proposed he re that the cancer antigen load may have a similar effect on \"immune exhaustion\" and that pathogen load and tumor load may act additively to accelerate immunosenescence. Understanding how and why i mmune responsiveness changes in humans as they age is essential for devel oping strategies to prevent or re store dysregulated immunity and assure healthy longevity, clearly possible only if cancer is avoided. Here, we provide an overview of the impact of age on human immune competence, emphasizing T-cell-dependent adaptive immunity, which is the most sensitive to ageing. This knowledge will pave the way for rational interventions to maintain or rest ore appropriate immune f unction not only in the elderly but also in the cancer patient. REVIEW: Mumm JB, Oft M Cytokine-based transformation into tumor-promoting inflammation Oncogene-2008; 27: 5913-5919. During the last decade, it has become clear th at the mammalian immune system is able to recognize and partially suppress nascent tumors. Human T cells specific to oncogenes and onco- fetal antigens are present in human cancer patients and their tumors. At the same time, molecular links between tumor-associated inflammation and tumor progression have been uncovered, providing an explanation for the long recognized epidemiological link between inflammation and cancer. The synopsis of these findings suggests a ne w interpretation of tumo r immunity. It appears that antigen recognition or antigen- specific T-cell expansion at larg e is not as profoundly impaired in tumor patients as the correct polarization, the survival and the effector function of tumor- infiltrating T cells. This review will focus on pro-inflammatory cy tokines likely to contribute to the deregulation of tumor-specific immunity and its consequences.

Here, we review the broadly accumulating evidence for a crucial 83contribution of NK cells to the i mmunosurveillance of tumours and the molecular mechanisms that allow NK cells to distinguish malignant from hea lthy cells. Particular emphasis is placed on the activating NK receptor NKG2D, which recognizes a variety of MHC class I-related molecules believed to act as 'immuno-alerters' on malignant cells, and on tumour-mediated counterstrategies promoting escape from NKG2D-mediated recognition.

In this report, we show that human T cells from healt hy donors incubated with tumor for only 6 h at a low tumor to T-cell ratio undergo a senescence-like phenotype, characterized by the loss of CD27 and CD28 expression and telomere shortening. Tumo r-induced senescence of T cells is induced by soluble factors and triggers increases in expression of senescence-associated molecules such as p53, p21, and p16. Importantly, these T cells are not only phenotypically altered, but also functionally altered as th ey can suppress th e proliferation of responder T cells. This suppression requires cell-to-cell contact and is mediated by senescent CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations, which are distinct from classicall y described natural T regulatory cells. Our observations support the novel concept that tumor can induce senescent T cells with suppressor function and may effect both the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. REVIEW: Aggarwal BB, Shishodia S, Sandur SK, Pandey M, link? Biochem Pharmacol 2006; 72: 1605-1621 Although inflammation has known as a lo calized protective reac tion of tissue to irritation, injury, or infection, characterized by pain, redness, swelling, and sometimes loss of function, there has been a new real ization about its role in a wide variety of diseases, including cancer. While acute inflammation is a part of the defense response, chronic inflammation can lead to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, pulmonar y, and neurological di seases. Several pro- inflammatory gene products have been identified that mediate a critical role in suppression of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogene sis, invasion, and metastasis. Among these gene products are TNF and expression of all these genes are mainly regulated by the transcription factor NF- B, which is constitutively active in most tumors and is induced by carcinogens (such as cigarette smoke), tumor prom oters, imply that anti-inflammatory agents that suppress NF-B or NF-B-regulated products should have a potenti al in both the prev ention and treatment of cancer. The current review describes in detail the critical link between inflammation and cancer. 84RESEARCH FRONTIER: Mathew R, Karantza -Wadsworth V, White E in cancer Nature Reviews 2007; 7: 961-967 Autophagy is a cellular degradation pathway for the clearance of damaged or superfluous proteins and organelles. The recycling of th ese intracellular constituents also serves as an alternative energy source during periods of metabolic stress to mainta in homeostasis and viability. In tumour cells with defects apoptosis, autophagy allows pr olonged survival. Paradoxi cally, autophagy defects are associated with increased tumorigenesis, but the mechanism behind this has not been determined. Recent evidence suggests that aut ophagy provides a protective function to limit tumour necrosis and inflammation, and to mitigate genome damage in tumour cells in response to metabolic stress. 1. Tumor specific and tumor associated antigens REVIEW: Simpson AJG, Cancer/testis (CT) antigens, of which more th an 40 have now been id entified, are encoded by genes that are normally expressed only in the human germ line, but are also expressed in various tumour types, including melanoma, and carci nomas of the bladder, lung and liver. These immunogenic proteins are being vigo rously pursued as targets for th erapeutic cancer vaccines. CT antigens are also being evaluated for their role in oncogenesis \u2014 recapitulation of portions of the germline gene-expression programme might contribut e characteristic features to the neoplastic phenotype, including immortality, invasiveness, immune evasion, hypomethylation and metastatic capacity. REVIEW: Schietinger A, Semin Immunol 2008; 20: 276-85 From the earliest days in the field of tumor immunology three questions have been asked: do cancer cells express tumor-specific antigens, does the immune system recognize these antigens and if so, what is their biochemical nature? We now know that truly tu mor-specific antigens exist, that they are caused by somatic mutations, and that th ese antigens can induce both humoral and cell- mediated immune responses. Because tumor-speci fic antigens are exclusively expressed by the cancer cell and are often crucial for tumorigeni city, they are ideal targets for anti-cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the antigens that ar e targeted today by anti-tumor immunotherapy are not tumor-specific antigens, but antigens that are normal molecules also expressed by normal tissues (so-called \"tumor-associated\" antigens). If tumor-specific antigens exist and are ideal targets for immunotherapy, why are they not being targeted? In this review, we summarize current knowledge of tumor-specifi c antigens: their identification, immunological relevance and clinical use. We discuss novel tumor-specific epitopes and propose new approaches that could improve the success of cancer immunothera py, especially for the treatment of solid tumors. 85WEBSITE LINK: Antigen-encoding genes and epitopes. http://www.cancerimmunity.org Cancer Immunity.

REVIEW: Gasparini P, Sozzi G, Pierotti MA The role of Chromosomal Alterati ons in Human Cancer Development J Cell Biochem 2007; 102: 320-331 Cancer cells become unstable and compromised because several cancer-predisposing mutations affect genes that are responsible for maintaining the genomic instability. Several factors influence the formation of chromosomal rearrangements and c onsequently of fusion genes and their role in tumorigenesis. Studies over the past decades have revealed that recurring chromosome rearrangements leading to fusion genes have a biol ogical and clinical impact not only on leukemias and lymphomas, but also on certain epithelial tumors. With the implementation of new and powerful cytogenetic and molecular techniques the identifi cation of fusion genes in solid tumors is being facilitated. Overall, the st udy of chromosomal translocations have revealed several recurring themes, and reached important insights into the process of malignant transformation. However, the mechanisms behind these translocations remain unclear. A more thorough understanding of the mechanisms that cause translocations will be aided by continuing characterization of translocation breakpoints and by developing in vitro and in vivo model systems that can generate chromosome translocation. REVIEW: Grisendi S, Pandolfi PP Two Decades of Cancer Genetics: From Specificity to Pleiotropic Networks Cold Spring Symposia on quantitat ive Biology 2005; Symposium 70: 83-91 Modeling cancer in mice has reached an even gr eater relevance in the field of hematological malignancies, due to the already advanced characterization of the molecular basis of many hematological disorders. These mouse models have often allowed us to achieve insight into the pathogenesis of the human disease as well as to test novel therapeutic mo dalities in preclinical studies. However, one of the most rewarding cu ltural shifts triggered by these modeling efforts stems from what was originally perceive d as background noise or modeling inaccuracy. Manipulation of the involved gene s often triggered cancer susceptibil ity in cell types other than the hematopoietic lineages. This prompted us to challenge a fundamental misconception in cancer genetics that the approximately 200 genes directly involved in chromosomal translocations associated with hematopoietic malignancies are specifically and functi onally restricted to leukemia/lymphoma pathogenesis only. The gene tics underlying the pathogenesis of leukemia and lymphoma have historically been regarded as distinct from t hose underlying the pathogenesis of solid tumors because hematopoietic malignancie s are often associated with characteristic chromosomal translocations that are leukemia- or lymphoma-specific. In this paper, we discuss how leukemia/lymphoma genes indeed participat e in fundamental proto-oncogenic and growth- suppressive networks and may play a wider role in cancer pathogene sis. We focus on paradigmatic 86examples such as c-my c and PML, as well as on more recent findings from our laboratory concerning the role of NPM in tumorigenesis. REVIEW: Fukasawa K Oncogenes and tumour on centrosomes Nature Reviews Cancer 2007; 7: 911-924 Chromosome instability, which is equated to mitotic defects and consequential chromosome segregation errors, provides a formidable basis for the acquisition of further malignant phenotypes during tumour progression. Centrosomes have a cruc ial role in the formation of bipolar mitotic spindles, which are essential for accurate chromo some segregation. Mutations of certain oncogenic and tumour-suppressor proteins directly induce ch romosome instability by disrupting the normal function and numeral integrity of centrosomes. How these proteins control centrosome duplication and function, and how their mutational activatio n and/or inactivation results in numeral and functional centrosome abnormalities, is discussed in this review. REVIEW: Iacobuzio-Donahue C Epigenetic changes in cancer Annu Rev Pathol Mech Dis 2009; 4: 229-249 Cancer is as much an epigenetic disease as it is a genetic disease, and ep igenetic alterations in cancer often serve as potent surrogates for genetic mu tations. Normal epigenetic modifications of DNA encompass three types of changes: chroma tin modifications, DNA me thylation, and genomic imprinting, each of which is altered in cancer cells. This review addresses the various epigenetic modifications that are pervasive among human tumors and traces th e history of cancer epigenetics from the first observations of altered global methylation content to the recently proposed epigenetic progenitor model, which provide s a common unifying mechanism for cancer development.

Immunoregulatory Mechanisms 1. Tolerance REVIEW: Mitchell Kronenberg and Alexander Rudensky Regulation of immunity by self-reactive T cells Nature 2005;435:598-604 A basic principle of immunology is that lymphocytes respond to fore ign antigens but tolerate self tissues. For developing T cells, the ability to dis tinguish self from non-self is acquired in the thymus, where the majority of self-reactive cells are eliminated. Recently, however, it has become 87apparent that som e self-reactive T cells avoid being destroyed and inst ead differentiate into specialized regulatory cells. This appears to be beneficial. Subpopulations of self-reactive T cells have a strong influence on self tolerance and may represent targets for therapeutic intervention to control a variety of autoimmune dis eases, tumour growth and infection REVIEW: Goodnow C, Sprent J, Fazekas de St Groth B and Vinuesa CG Cellular and genetic mechanisms of self tolerance and autoimmunity Nature 2005;435:590-597 The mammalian immune system has an extraordinar y potential for making receptors that sense and neutralize any chemical entity entering the body. Inevitably, some of these receptors recognize components of our own body, and so cellular mechanis ms have evolved to control the activity of these 'forbidden' receptors and achieve immunol ogical self tolerance. Many of the genes and proteins involved are conserved between humans and other mammals. This provides the bridge between clinical studies and mechanisms defined in experimental animals to understand how sets of gene products coordinate self-tolerance mechanis ms and how defects in these controls lead to autoimmune disease. LANDMARK ARTICLE: Aluvihare VR, Kallikourdis M, Betz AG Regulatory T cells mediate mat ernal tolerance to the fetus Nat Immunol. 2004 Mar;5(3):266-71. Pregnancy constitutes a major challenge to the mate rnal immune system, as it has to tolerate the persistence of paternal alloan tigen. Although localized mechanisms contribute to fetal evasion from immune attack, maternal alloreactive ly mphocytes persist. We demonstrate here an alloantigenin dependent, systemic expansion of the maternal CD25+ T cell pool during pregnancy and show that this population contains dominant regulatory T cell activity. In addition to their function in suppressing autoimmune responses, maternal regulatory T cells suppressed an aggressive allogeneic response directed against the fetus. Their abse nce led to a failure of gestation due to immunological rejection of the fetus. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Hori S, Nomura T , Sakaguchi S. Control of Regulatory T Cell Developmen t by the Transcription Factor Foxp3 Science 2003:99;1057- 1061 Regulatory T cells engage in the maintenan ce of immunological self -tolerance by actively suppressing self-reactive lymphocytes. Little is known, however, about th e molecular mechanism of their development. Here we show that Foxp3 , which encodes a transcri ption factor that is genetically defective in an au toimmune and inflammatory syndrome in humans and mice, is specifically expressed in naturally arising CD4+ regulatory T cells. Furthermore, retroviral gene transfer of Foxp3 converts na\u00efve T cells toward a regulator y T cell phenotype similar to that of naturally occurring CD4+ regulatory T cells. Thus, Foxp3 is a key regulatory gene for the development of regulatory T cells. CUTTING EDGE: Hernandez MG , Shen L optimal progra mming, maintenance, and recall of CD8+ T cell memory even in the absence of CD4+ T cell help. CD40 stimulation is one of the many signals that can activate APCs and we have recently shown it to have a unique function in generating maximum primary CD8(+) T cell responses. However, whether CD40 signaling plays a role in memory CD 8(+) T cell responses is still not completely understood. In this study, we show that in the absence of CD40 on all APCs or specifically on dendritic cells, memory CD8(+) T cells are gene rated but at significantl y reduced levels. This reduction is due to a contribution of CD40 at several different steps in the generation of CD8(+) memory. In the initial T cell re sponse, CD40 contributes to maxi mizing not only the number of effector cells that are generated but also the programming of ones that will differentiate into memory. Subsequently, CD40 is needed to main tain maximal numbers of the committed memory cells in a manner that is independent of the i mmunizing Ag. Finally, when memory CD8(+) T cells are reactivated there is a variable requirem ent for CD40 depending on whether CD40 or CD4(+) Th cells were present during the primary response. Therefore, CD40 signaling on APCs plays an important role in all phases of a memory CD8(+) T cell response. CUTTING EDGE: Goriely S , Goldman M . Interleukin- 12 family members and the ba lance between rejection and tolerance. Curr Opin Organ Transplant. 2008 Feb;13(1):4-9 Allograft rejection involves multip le effector m echanisms. Interleukin(IL)-12 family members play a critical role in influenc ing helper T-cell differentiation and inflammatory processes, and their respective role in orchestrating inflammation of autoimmune or infectious origin starts to be unravelled. We highlight recent findings on the f unction of the different IL-12 family members: IL-12p70, IL-23, IL-27 and IL-35 and discuss thei r possible involvement in influencing the balance between graft rejection and tolerance. RECENT FINDINGS: The ca pacity of dendritic cells to produce IL-12 and IL-23 strongly influences th e outcome of CD4 T-cell responses. While the IL-12/interferon-gamma axis has classically been involved in autoimmune pathologies and acute graft rejection, it is now cl ear that it also displays immunor egulatory propertie s. In contrast, IL-23 promotes the function of proinflammatory IL-17-producing cells in both mice and humans. Both IL-27 and IL-35 have recently emerged as important regulators of adaptive immune responses. SUMMARY: The contribution of the IL -12/interferon-gamma pathway to acute graft rejection may be more complicated than ini tially thought. As our unde rstanding of the IL-12 family is rapidly growing and changing, the respectiv e role of its members in orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses toward alloantigens should be addressed. 2.

Anti-id Tregs recognize specif ic effector clones by their peptides; anti-id networks of CD4+ and CD8+ Treg s have been described in detail. Here we shall 89focus on anti-erg T regulators. Anti-erg T cells, un like anti-id T cells, do no t recognize the clonal identity of effector T cells; ra ther, anti-erg T cells recognize the state of activation of target effector T cells, irrespective of their TCR specificity. We consider several features of anti-erg T cells: their ontogeny, subset markers, and target ergotope molecules; mechanisms by which they regulate other T cells; mechanisms by which they get regulated; and ther CW Jr, JC , Falk RJ Autoimmunity is triggered by cPR-3(105- 20 1), a protein complementary to human autoantigen proteinase-3. Nat Med. 2004 Jan;10(1):72-9. Epub 2003 Dec 7. Nat Med. 2004 Jan;10(1):17-18 It remains unclear how and why autoimmunity occu rs. Here we show evidence for a previously unrecognized and possibly general mechanism of autoimmunity. This new finding was discovered serendipitously using material from patients w ith inflammatory vascular disease caused by antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) with specificity for proteinase-3 (PR-3). Such harbor not only antibodies to the autoan tigen (PR-3), but also antibodies to a peptide translated the antisense DNA strand of PR-3 (complementary PR-3, cPR-3) or to a mimic of this peptide. Immunization of mice with the middle region of cPR-3 resulted in production of antibodies not only to cPR-3, but also to the im munogen's sense peptide counterpart, PR-3. Both human and mouse antibodies to PR-3 and cPR- 3 bound to each other, indicating idiotypic relationships. These findings indi cate that autoimmunity can be initiated through an immune response against a peptide that is antisense or complementary to the autoantigen, which then induces anti-idiotypic antibodies (autoantibodies) that cro ss-react with the autoantigen. 3. Apoptosis REVIEW: Zhang N. Hartig H. Dzhagalov et al. The role of apoptosis in the developm ent and function of T lymphocytes. Cell Research. 2005;15:749-69. Apoptosis plays an essential role in T cell biology. Thymocytes expressing nonfunctional or autoreactive TCRs are eliminated by apoptosis du ring development. Apoptosis also leads to the deletion of expanded effector T cells during immune responses. Th e dysregulation of apoptosis in the immune system results in autoimmunity, tumorogenesis and immunodeficiency. Two major pathways lead to apoptosis: the intrinsic cell death pathway cont rolled by Bcl-2 family members and the extrinsic cell death pathway controlled by death receptor signaling. These two pathways work together to regulate T lymphocyte development and function.

CUTTING EDGE: T Transactivation of EGF receptor and ErbB2 from TNF- induced apoptosis Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Aug Epub 2008 Aug 13. TNF is a pleiotropic bot h anti- and proapoptotic si gnaling pathways, with cell fate determined by the balance between th ese two pathways. Activa tion of ErbB fam ily members, including EGF receptor (EGFR/ErbB1), promotes cell survival and regulates several signals that overlap with thos e stimulated by TNF. This study was undertaken to determine the effects of TNF on EGFR and ErbB 2 activation and intestinal epit helial cell survival. Mice, young adult mouse colon epithelial cells , and EGFR knockout mouse colon epithelial cells were treated with TNF. Activation of EGFR, ErbB2, Akt, Src, and apoptosis were in vivo and in vitro. TNF stimulated EGFR phosphorylation in young adult mouse colon ep ithelial cells, and loss of EGFR expression or inhibiti on of kinase activity increased TNF-induced apoptosis, which was prevented in WT not by -inactive EGFR expression. compared with WT mice. TNF also activated ErbB2, loss of Er bB2 expression increased TNF-i nduced apoptosis. Furthermore, Src-kinase activity and the expression of both EGFR and ErbB2 were required for TNF-induced cell survival. Akt was shown to be a downstream target of TNF-activated EGFR and ErbB2. These findings demonstrate that EGFR and ErbB2 are critical mediator s of TNF-regulated antiapoptotic signals in intestinal epithelial cells. Given evidence for TNF signaling in the development of colitis-associated carcinoma, this observation has significant im plications for understanding the role of EGFR in maintaining intestinal epit helial cell homeostasis during cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses.

Maintenance of Human T Cell Anergy: Blocking of IL-2 Gene Transcription by Activated Rap1 Science 1997;278:124-8} In the absence of costimulation, T cells activ ated through their anti gen receptor become unresponsive (anergic) and do not transcribe the gene encoding interleukin-2 (IL-2) when restimulated with antigen. Aner gic alloantigen-specifi c human T cells contained phosphorylated Cbl that coimmunoprecipitated with Fyn. The adapter protein CrkL associated with both phosphorylated Cbl and on Rap1. Active Ra p1 (GTP-bound form) was present in anergic cells. Forced expression of low amounts ofRap1-GTP in Jurkat T cells recapitulated the anergic defect and blocked T cell anti gen receptor (TCR)-and CD28-mediated IL-2 gene transcription. 91Therefore, Rap1 functions as a negative regulator of TCRmediated IL-2 gene transcription and m ay be responsible for the specific def ect in IL-2 production in T cell anergy. REVIEW ARTICLE: Kemper C, Chan AC, Green JM, et al. Activation of human CD4+ cells with CD3 a nd CD46 induces a T-regulatory cell 1 phenotype Nature 2003;421:388-392 The immune system must distinguish not only between self and non-self, but also between innocuous and pathological foreign antigens to prevent unnecessary or self-destructive immune responses. Unresponsiveness to harmless antigens is establishe d through central and peripheral processes1. Whereas clonal deletion and anergy are mechanisms of peripheral tolerance2, 3, active suppression by T-regulatory 1 (Tr1) cells has emerged as an essential fact or in the control of autoreactive cells 4. Tr1 cells are CD4+ T lymphocytes that are defined by their production of interleukin 10 (IL-10)5 and suppression of T-helper cells6; however, the physiological conditions underlying Tr1 differentiation are unknown. Here we show that co-engagement of CD3 and the complement regulator CD46 in the presence of IL -2 induces a Tr1-specific cytokine phenotype in human CD4+ T cells. These IL-10-producing CD4+ cells proliferate strongly, suppress activa tion of bystander T cells and acquire a memory phenotype. Our findings identify an endogenous receptor mediated event that drives Tr1 differentiation and suggest that the complement system has a previously unapprecia ted role in T-cell-mediated immunity and tolerance. CUTTING EDGE: th e induction of T cell anergy J Immunol. 2008 Aug 1;181(3):1622-6. Activation of naive T lymphocytes is regulated through a series of discrete checkpoints that maintain unresponsiveness to self. During th is multis tep process, costimulatory interactions act as inducible signals that allow APCs to selectively m obilize T cells against foreign Ags. In this study, we provide evidence that the anergy-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase GRAIL (gene related to anergy expression of the co stimulatory molecule CD40L on CD4 T cells. Using its luminal protease-associated domain, GRAIL bi nds to the luminal/ext racellular portion of CD40L and facilitates transfer of ubiquitin molecules from the intracellular GRAIL RING (really interesting new gene) finger to the small cyto solic portion of CD40L. Do wn-regulation of CD40L occurred following ectopic expression of GRAI L in naive T cells from CD40(-/-) mice, and expression of GRAIL in bone marrow chimeric mi ce was associated with diminished lymphoid follicle formation. These data provide a model fo r intrinsic T cell regula tion of costimulatory molecules and a molecular framework for the initiation of clonal T cell anergy. G. Laboratory Measurements 1.

The response to these polys accharides is important in the evaluation of patients with documented immune abnormalities a nd those individuals who have normal total immunoglobulin levels. Although profound imm une deficiencies, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia and severe combined immunodefi ciency, are always associated with a defect in specific antibody production, so me immune disorders may have variable responses, whereas others with persistent IgG or IgG subclass de ficiencies may have normal or clearly abnormal antipolysaccharide antibodies. Measurement of th e response to pneumococcal polysaccharides is preferred because of the availa bility of a pure polysaccharide v accine for antigen challenge and standardized techniques to m easure specific antibody responses.

A clinical to in systemic rheumatic disorders. Autoimmun Rev. 2007; 7:77-84. Musculoskeletal disorders constitute one of the most common clinical presentations to clinical care givers. Within this category of illnesses, systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD) such as systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis are included in the differential diagnosis. A hallmar k of SARD is the production of autoantibodies, which are routinely requested as a guide to diagnosis and clinical decision making. The field of serological tests, including the de tection of autoantibodies, is comp lex and often leads to confusion and misunderstanding. When used appropriately, auto antibodies can be a valuable adjunct to the 94diagnosis, and occasionally therapy and prognosis, of SARD. The role of autoantibody testing and a 'practical' approach to using these tests is the focus of this paper. iii. in vitro testing techniques for specific IgE REVIEW ARTICLE: Hamilton RG, Atkinson NF Jr. In vitro assays for the diagnosis of IgE-mediated disorders. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2004;114:213-25 Advances in technology have provided new labora tory tools for the qua ntitation of allergen- specific IgE antibodies in serum and on the surf ace of basophils. This review exam ines the evolution from qualitative IgE antibody assays of the late 1960s to the present-day, third-generation, automated and quantitative allergen-speci fic IgE assays. The late st technology trend is toward microarrays in which crude or purified na tive and recombinant allergens can be spotted in microdot arrays on silica chips to permit extensiv e panels of specific IgE measurements to be performed with small quantities of serum. A lthough these technologies hold promise, their diagnostic performance requires further assessm ent once their technical details have been optimized. Potential abuses of this newe r IgE antibody technology include the use of allergosorbent specificities (eg, especially food and drugs) that lack validation, application of IgE antibody measurements in the diagnosis of non-Ig E-dependent disorders (eg, aspirin sensitivity), and modification of IgE antibody assays to measur e food-specific IgG antibody for which there is no clinical indication. Basophil medi ator release assays have evolve d to include flow cytometric methods that can quantitatively detect the pr esence of cell surface-bound allergen-specific IgE antibodies. Assays for histamine and leukotriene C 4 released after in vitr o basophil activation are now more accurate and standardized. Current anal ytic methods for IgE antibodies provide more quantitative and reproducible meas urements of IgE than ever be fore, although still with less sensitivity that traditional skin testing. The curre nt challenge is to tran slate the quantitative IgE antibody results into a more accurate diagnosis of allergic disease. RESEARCH FRONTIER: King detection of tota l and allergen-specific IgE by using purified allerg ens in a fluorescent array J Allergy Clin 2007;120:1126-31 BACKGROUND: Testing serum samples for total and allergen-specific IgE requires separate testing for each antibody and allergen specificity. OBJECTIVE: To apply fluorescent suspension array technology to allow simultane ous detection of tota l and allergen-specific IgE in serum in a single quantitative test. METHODS: A 7-plex suspension array for the simultaneous detection of total IgE and IgE specific to Der p 1, Der p 2, Fel d 1, Can f 1, Bet v 1, and Phl p 5 was developed, using mAb or purified allergens covalently coupled to fluorescent microspheres. The multiplex array was validated by comparing total and allergen-specific IgE levels in serum from patients with allergy with results obt ained by enzyme immunoassays. RESULTS: There was a highly significant correlation between total IgE levels measured by multiplex array and fluorescent enzyme immunoassay (r = 0.97; P < .001; n = 63). Total and allergen-specific IgE levels also correlated with enzyme-linked and fluorescent enzyme immunoassay results (r = 0.44-0.94; n = 95 or 106). The multiplex array was reproducible (r = 0.86-0.99; mean coefficient of variance percentage, 12% to 25%). The a assay <20 microL immunoassays. CONCLUSION: The multiplex array is a high-throughput system that allows s imultaneous quantification of allergen-specific and total IgE. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our results suggest that fluorescent multiplex technology will facilitate epidemiologic studies of alle rgic sensitization. The reduced serum volume is an advantage for pediatric studies. GUIDELINE PRACTICE PARAMETER: Bernstein IL , Li JT, Bernstein DI, et al.

RAST potencies were determined by the capacity of the extract to inhibit the bindi ng of IgE antibody to solid-phase allergen, and they were expresse d as the quantity of ex tract required for 50% inhibition of binding. Potencies determined by skin te sting in 8 patients were signifi cantly related among the various patients in 19 of 27 comparisons and showed differences of up to 95,000-fold in the strengths of the extracts. Estimation of potencies by RAST inhibition showed approximately a 100-fold difference among the extracts and in 5 of 8 cases these were si gnificantly related to potencies measured by skin tests. Similarly, PNU determinations and Group I determinations were also significantly related to potencies by skin test ti tration in 5 of 8 and in 4 of 8 comparisons, respectively. Comparison of the geometric mean sk in test potencies with RAST, PNU, and Group I potencies revealed that all were significantly related to skin te st potencies although the correlation of RAST and skin potency was th e highest. The results indicate that measurement of potency by RAST inhibition compares favorably with other in vitro measurements of potency. These results are compared with those of a prior study with extracts of short ragweed, and the reasons for the differences between the results in the two studies are discussed. v. serologic testing for infectious disease REVIEW ARTICLE: Fierz W . Basic problems of serological laboratory diagnosis. Methods Mol Med. 2004;94:393-425 Serological laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases is inflicted with several kinds of basic problem s. One difficulty relates to the fact that the serological dia gnosis of infectious diseases is double indirect: The first indirect aim in diagnos ing an infectious dis ease is to identify the m icrobial agent that caused the disease. The second indirect aim is to identify this infectious agent by measuring the patient's immune response to the potential agent. Thus, th e serological test is neither measuring directly disease nor the cause of the disease, but the patient's immune system. 96The latter poses another type of problem, because each person 's immune system is unique. The immune response to an infectious agent is usually of polyclonal nature, and the exact physicochemical properties of antibodies are unique for each clone of antibody. The clonal makeup and composition and, therefore, the way an i ndividual's immune system sees an infectious agent, depends not only on the genetic backgr ound of the person but also on the individual experience from former encounters with various inf ectious agents. In conse quence, the reaction of a patient's serum in an analytical system is not precisely predicta ble. Also, the antigenic makeup of an infectious agent is not always foreseeable. Antig enic variations leading to different serotypes is a quite common phenomenon. Altogether, these biol ogical problems lead to complexities in selecting the appropriate tests a nd strategies for testing, in in terpreting the results, and in standardizing serological test syst ems. For that reason, a close collabo ration of the laboratory with the clinic is mandatory to avoid erroneous conclu sions from serological test results, which might lead to wrong decisions in patient care. vi. flow cytometry -cell surface marker and intracellular techniques REVIEW ARTICLE: Hernandez-Trujillo VP,Fleisher TA Interpretation of flow cytometry in primary immunodeficiency disorders Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 2008;100:612-615 The laboratory evaluation of primary immunodefici ency disorders (PIDDs) has evolved with the development of new technologies, including fl ow cytometry, to characterize circulating lymphocytes.

The observation that circulating leucocytes adhere to and migrate across th e vascular endothelium was first made 70 yr ago; this was noted to oc cur without breach of th e endothelial barrier, suggesting the presence of comple x regulatory mechanisms. More recently, in a series of classic experiments, Gowans and Knight observed that lymphocytes isolated fr om the rat thoracic duct homed rapidly back to lymph nodes and secondary lymphoid organs upon rein jection: furthermore, it was noted that this occurred across the distinctly shaped endothelial cells of the postcapillary venules. Since then we have learnt much about th e molecular basis of leuc ocyte extravasation and the regulatory mechanisms involved. In this re view we will describe molecular interactions involved in the stages of leucoc yte recruitment and extravasation into the tissues. We will also describe the specific molecular interactions that allow the selective recruitment of tissue-specific leucocytes to inflammatory sites. Finally, we will emphasize the central role that adhesion molecules have in the development of the infl ammatory response by drawing from examples of human disease, and describe recent progress in th e therapeutic targeting of these molecules with particular reference to inflammatory arthritis.

Textbook of Blood Banking and Transfusion Medicine. 2 nd Ed. Elsevier, 2005. REVIEW: Gerlach JA. Human lymphocyte antigen typing. Arch Med. 2002; 126: 281-4 . The human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) typing co mmunity was one of the early groups to adoptmolecular testing. This action was borne out of the need to identify the many alleles of the highly polymorphic HLA system. Early paradigms us ed restriction fragment length polymorphism regimes, but the polymerase chain reaction method of amplification quickly replaced that lessthandiscriminating choice. Methods currently in use for HLA typing, with commercial kits available, are sequence-specific oligonucleotide pr obe (both dot blot and the reverse blot dot), sequence-specific primer amplification, restriction fragment length polymorphism of amplified products, double-stranded sequence conformati on polymorphism without reference and microarray technologies. More than are recognized by the World Health Orga nization and meet their criteria for assignment. These alleles can be identified by molecular methods and represen t alleles present at cla ss I and class II loci of the HLA complex. On occasion, ambiguous results st ill persist, even with the best molecular typing methods. Therefore, it is clear to the HLA typing community that a combination of the above methods may be needed to allow true disc rimination of the possible alleles an individual carries in their genetic makeup. It is also clear that a typing la boratory may need to resort to nonmolecular serology to understand the signifi cance and impact of the type generated by the HLA molecular typing laboratory. e. genetic techniques including TRECs, PCR and use of probes. NOTE: Genetic techniques are powerful tools that allow the identification of stages of cellular development, gene expression, cell function, and signaling pathways. Protocols for many of these assays can be found in textbooks as well as in the Current Protocol se ries including Current Protocols in Immunology and Cu rrent Protocols in Molecula r Biology. These are available electronically in many academic libraries. The poly merase chain reaction (PCR) is an especially powerful tool that allows the amplification of small amounts of DNA, both qualitatively and quantitatively, as well as small amounts of R NA after reverse transc ription into DNA.

Ginzinger, DG. Gene quantification using real-time quantitat PCR: an technology hits the Mainstream Exp. Hemato l. 30: 503-512 (2002) The recent flood of using real-time Q-PCR te stifies to the transforma tion of this technology from an experimental tool into the scientific mainstream. Many of the applications of real-time QPCR include measuring mRNA expression leve ls, DNA copy number, transgene copy number and expression analysis, allelic discrimination, and measuring viral titers. The range of applications of real-time Q-PCR is immense and ha s been fueled in part by the proliferation of lower-cost instrumentation and reagents. Successful application of real-time Q-PCR is not trivial. However, this review will help guide the reader through the variab les that can limit the usefulness of this technology. Careful consideration of the assay design, template prep aration, and analytical methods are essential for accu rate gene quantification. REVIEW: Giulietti, A, Overbergh, L, Valckx, D, Decallonne, B, Mathieu, C. overview of real-time quantitative PCR: applications to quantify cytokine gene expression. Methods 25: 386-401 (2001). The analysis of cytokine profile s helps to clarify f unctional properties of immune cells, both for research and for clinical diagnosis. The real-tim e reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is becoming widely used to quantify cyt okines from cells, body fluids, tissues, or tissue biopsies. Being a very powerful and sensitive me thod it can be used to quantify mRNA expression levels of cytokines, which are often very low in the tissues under inves tigation. The method allows for the direct detection of PCR product during the exponential phase of the reaction, combining amplification and detection in one single step. In this review we di scuss the principle of real-time RT-PCR, the different methodologies and chemistr ies available, the asse ts, and some of the pitfalls. With the TaqMan chemistry and the 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems), validation for a large panel of murine and human cytokines and other factors playing a role in the immune system is discussed in deta il. In summary, the real-time RT-PCR technique is very accurate and sensitive, allows a high th roughput, and can be performed on very small samples; therefore it is the method of choice for quantification of cytokine profiles in immune cells or inflamed tissues. NOTE: An example of the use of quantitative PCR is th e measurement of T cell receptor excision circles 101(TREC) as a marker of T cells that have recen tly emigrated from the thymus. T cells are longlived and therefore, it is difficult to distinguish be tween recent emigrants from the thymus and long- lived na\u00efve T cells. During differentiation in the thymus, immature T cells randomly rearrange the variable regions of the T cell receptor chains. During this process, the intervening DNA between two approximated gene segments is exci sed as a circle and remains in the cell for a long time but does not replicate with cell divisi on. Quantitative measurement of these circles using PCR can identify recent emigrants from the thymus. This was nicely demonstrated in HIV patients, who lost their peripheral CD4 T cells but were generating new T cells in their thymus that survived in the periphery after HIV therapy. Several factors affect the expression of TRECs in T cells that are discussed in the paper below: REVIEW TREC: Hazenberg MD, Verschuren MCM, Hamann D, et al T cell receptor excision circles as markers for recent thymic emigrants: basic aspects, technical approach, and guidelines for interpretation. J Mol Med 79:631-640 (2001). T cell differentiation in the thymus is characterize d by a hierarchical order of rearrangement steps in the T cell receptor (TCR) genes, resulting in th e joining of V, D, and J gene segments. During each of the rearrangement steps, DNA fragments between rearranging V, D, and J gene segments are deleted as circular excision products, the so -called TRECs (T cell rece ptor excision circles). TRECs are assumed to have a high over-time stabili ty, but they can not multiply and consequently are diluted during T cell prolifera tion. It was recently suggested that quantitativ e detection of TRECs would allow for direct measurement of thymic output. The deltaRec-psiJalpha TREC appears to be the best marker, because the major ity of thymocyte expansion occurs before this TREC is formed. However, apart from thymic output several other factors determine the TREC content of a T cell population, such as cell division and cell deat h. Likewise, the number of TRECs depends not only on thymic output , but also on the longevity of naive T cells. This warrants caution with regard to the interpretation of TREC data as measured in healthy and diseased individuals. deltaRec-psiJalpha TR EC detection is a new and eleg ant tool for identification of recent thymic emigrants in the periphery, but further research is required for making quantitative estimations of thymic output w ith the use of TREC analysis. LANDMARK ARTICLE TREC: Livak, F. & Schatz, D. T-cell receptor locus V(D)J recombinatio n by-products are abundant and mature T cells. Mol. Cell. Biol: 1996;16:609-618. In addition to the assembled coding regions of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, the V(D)J recombination reaction can in principle genera te three types of by-products in normal developing lymphocytes: broken DNA molecules that terminate in a recombination signal sequence or a coding region (termed signal or coding end mole cules, respectively) and DNA molecules containing fused recombination signal se quences (termed reciprocal products). Using a quantitative Southern blot analysis of the murine TCR alpha locus, we dem onstrate that substantial amounts of signal end molecules and reciprocal pr oducts, but not coding end molecules, exist in thymocytes, while peripheral T ce lls contain substantial amounts of reciprocal products. At the 5' end of the J alpha locus, 20% of thymus DNA exists as signal end molecules. An additional 30 to 40% of the TCR alpha/delta locus exists as rema rkably stable reciprocal products throughout Tcell development, with the consequence that the TCR C delta region is substantia lly retained in alpha 102beta committed T cells. The disappearance of the broken DNA m olecules occurs in the same developmental transition as termination of expr ession of the recombinati on activating genes, RAG- 1 and RAG-2. These findings raise important qu estions concerning the mechanism of V(D)J recombination and the maintenance of geno me integrity during lymphoid development. LANDMARK ARTICLE - TREC: Douek DC, McFarland RD, Keiser PH, et al. Changes in thymic function with age a nd during the treatment of HIV infection. Nature 1998;396:690-695. The thymus represents the majo r site of the production and ge neration of T cells expressing alphabeta-type T-cell antigen recep tors. Age-related i nvolution may affect the ability of the thymus to reconstitute T cells expressing CD4 cell-surface antigens that are lost during HIV infection; this effect has been seen after ch emotherapy and bone-marro w transplantation. Adult HIV-infected patients treated with highly ac tive antiretroviral therapy (HAART) show a progressive increase in their num ber of naive CD4-positive T cells. These cells could arise through expansion of existing naive T cells in the periph ery or through thymic production of new naive T cells. Here we quantify thymic output by meas uring the excisional DNA products of TCR-gene rearrangement. We find that, although thymic functi on declines with age, substantial output is maintained into late adulthood. HIV infection leads to a decrease in thymic function that can be measured in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissu es. In adults treated with HAART, there is a rapid and sustained increase in t hymic output in most subjects. Thes e results indicate that the adult thymus can contribute to imm une reconstitution Methods Mol Biol 404:409-430, 2007 Microarrays and related technologies have allowed investigators to ask biological questions in far greater detail than has previously been possible. Microarrays had a trouble d beginning, but most of these problems resulted from th e growing pains of this technology, which, like many new things, was initially more promise than delivery. Neverthele ss, over the past few years, investigators have learned how to achieve optimal performance of technology, and now exciting discoveries are made using microarray-based research. Many of the adva nces have come from the realization that microarrays are not a magic to ol but rather are like any ot her measurement device. Unless microarray experimentation is coupled with good experimental practices, it will not yield valid results or, worse yet, may lead to misleading resu lts. In this chapter, we highlight some of the important steps that should be taken to successfully conduct a micr oarray study. These steps include a clearly stated biologi cal question, experimental design, careful experimental conduct, complete statistical analysis, validation/verifi cation of results, and dissemination of the data. f. hybridoma and monoclonal antibody technology NOTE: Antibodies are important for immunity by their ab ility to recognize pat hogens, neutralize their toxins, opsonize their uptake by phagocytic cells or kill them directly in conjunction with complement proteins. Antibodies are also used for laboratory investigation to specifically identify proteins in a multitude of situations and using a variety of techniques. The ability to generate a monoclonal antibody with a single specificity from a single B cell has revolutionized the use of antibodies in clinical and laborat ory studies. B cells are fused with a myeloma cell to generate a 103hybridoma that produces the same antibody as the B cell used in the fusion. The hybridoma is long-lived and provides a virtually unlimite d amount of antibody as described below: REVIEW Hybridoma technology: Lonberg N Human antibodies from transgenic mice. Nat Biotech 2005;23:1117-1125. Laboratory mice provide a ready so urce of diverse, high-affinity and high-specificity monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). However, development of rodent antibodies as therapeutic agents has been impaired by the inherent immunogenicity of these molecules.One t echnology that has been explored to generate lo w immunogenicity mAbs for in vivo therapy involves the use of transgenic mice expressing repertoires of human antibody ge ne sequences. This technology has now been exploited by over a dozen different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies toward developing new therapeutic mAbs, and currently at least 33 different drug s in clinical testing\u2014 including several in pivotal trials\u2014contain variable regions en coded by human sequences from transgenic mice. The emerging data from these trials provide an early glimpse of the safety and efficacy issues for these molecules. Nevertheless, actual product approval, the biggest challenge so far, is required to fully validate this technology as a drug discovery tool. In the future, it may be possible to extend this technology beyond rodents and use transgenic farm animals to directly generate and produce human sequence polyclonal sera. Nelson PN, Reynolds GM, antibodies. Mol Pathol 2000;53:111-117. Monoclonal antibodies are essential tools for many molecular immunol ogy investigations. In particular, when used in combination with t echniques such as epitope mapping and molecular modelling, monoclonal antibodies enable the antigenic profiling and visualisation of macromolecular surfaces. In addition, monoclonal antibodies have become key components in a vast array of clinical laboratory diagnostic te sts. Their wide applic ation in detecting and identifying serum analytes, cell markers, and pa thogenic agents has largely arisen through the exquisite specificity of these uni que reagents. Furthermore, the continuous culture of hybridoma cells that produce these antibodies offers the pot ential of an unlimited su pply of reagent. In essence, when compared with th e rather limited supply of polycl onal antibody reagents, the feature of a continuous supply enables the standardisation of both the reagent and the assay technique. Clearly, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of generation, cost, and overall applications. U ltimately, monoclonal antibodies are only produced when necessary because their production is tim e consuming and frustrating, although greatly rewarding (at least most of the time!). This is especially apparent when a monoclonal antibody can be applied successfully in a rout ine pathology laboratory or can ai d in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients. In this article, the generation and applica tion of monoclonal antibodies are demystified to enable greater understanding and hope fully formulate novel ideas for clinicians and scientists alike.

A variety of methods are availabl e to measure these cytokines and mediators individually such as ELISA-based methods, most of which are available in kit form. Quantitative RT-PCR allows for the measurement of numerous cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators, whose genes are actively transcri bed after a stimulus. With quant itative RT-PCR it is possible to measure cytokines and other mediators from small samples of cells/tissues and to measure several cytokines/mediators at the same time. Below is an articles that describes the us e of real-time RTPCR for the quantitation of cy tokines and other mediators: REVIEW: Blaschke V, Reich K, Blaschke S, et al. Rapid quantitation of proinflammatory and chem oattractant cytokine expression in small tissue samples monocyte-derived dendritic validation of a new real-time Immunol Methods 2000;246:79-90. The analysis of cytokine profiles plays a central part in the characteriza tion of disease-related inflammatory pathways and the identifica tion of functional properties of immune cell subpopulations. Because tissue biopsy samples are t oo small to allow the detection of cytokine protein, the detection of mRNA by RT-PCR analysis is often used to investigate the cytokine milieu in inflammatory lesions. RT-PCR itself is a qualitative method, indicating the presence or absence of specific transcripts. With the use of inte rnal or external standards it may also serve as a quantitative method. The most wi dely accepted method is quantitat ive competitive RT-PCR, based on internal shortened standards. Recentl y, online real-time PCR has been introduced (LightCycler), which allows quan titation in less than 30 min. Here, we have tested its use for the analysis of cytokine gene expressi on in different experimental in vitro and ex vivo settings. First, we compared quantitative competitive RT-PCR w ith real-time RT-PCR in the quantitation of transcription levels of the cell-specific chemoattractant Interleukin-16 during the maturation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and found a good co rrelation between both methods. Second, differences in the amounts of IL-16 mRNA in synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis as asse ssed by real-time RT-PCR paralleled differences in the level of IL-16 protein in the synovial fl uid. Finally, we employed real-time RT-PCR to study the cutaneous expression of several cytokines during experimental immu nomodulatory therapy of psoriasis by Interleukin-10, and demonstrate that the technique is suitable for pharmacogenomic monitoring. In summary, real-time RT-PCR is a sensitive and rapid tool for quantifying mRNA expression even with small quantities of tissue. The results obtained do not differ from those generated by quantitative competitive RT-PCR. 2.

REVIEW USE OF ROC ANALYSIS: Anthony K Akobeng Understanding diagnostic tests 3: recei ver operating characteristic curves Acta Paediatr 2007 May; 96(5):644-7. Epub 2007 Mar 21. The results of many clinical test s are quantitative and are provided on a continuous scale. To help decide the presence or absence of disease, a cut- off point for 'normal' or 'abnormal' is chosen. The sensitivity and specificity of a test vary according to the level that is chosen as the cut-off point. The receiver operating characteri stic (ROC) curve, a graphical technique for describing and comparing the accuracy of diagnostic tests, is ob tained by plotting the sensitivity of a test on the y axis against 1-specificity on the x axis. Two methods commonly used to establish the optimal cut- off point include the point on the ROC curve clos est to (0, 1) and the Youden index. The area under the ROC curve provides a measure of the overa ll performance of a di agnostic test. In this paper, the author explains how the ROC curve can be used to select optimal cut-off points for a test result, to assess the diagnosti c accuracy of a test, and to comp are the usefulness of tests. The ROC curve is obtained by calculating the sensitivity and specificity of a te st at every possible cut- off point, and plotting sensitivity against 1-specificity. The curve may be used to select optimal cut-off values for a test result, to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a test, and to compare the usefulness of different tests. 3. Unproven and inappropriate diagnos tic tests for allergic and immune deficiency diseases REVIEW: B. Niggemann, C. Gr\u00fcber Unproven diagnostic procedures in IgE-mediated allergic diseases Allergy. 2004 Aug; 59(8):806-8. A considerable body of literature on therapeutic aspects of complementary and alternative medicine has been published in recent years, bu t little is known on diagnostic procedures. This short review lists complementary and alternative diagnostic procedures for the diagnosis of allergic diseases and presents an assessment of their usefulness for the daily practice. The review of the literature revealed that neither the determin ation of specific immunoglob iridology, or electrodermal testing represent useful tests for the da ily practice. To date, no compleme ntary or alternative diagnostic 106procedure can be recomme nded as a meaningful el ement in the diagnostic work-up of allergic diseases. This is especially true for food aller gy: properly performed oral food challenges still represent the gold standard for implementing specifi c diets in food allergic individuals. Ineffective diagnostic approaches may be costly for th e consumer and delay appropriate therapy REVIEW CHAPTER: Abba I. Terr Unconventional Theories and Unproved Methods in Allergy in Middleton's Allergy: Prin ciples and Practice, 7th ed., Copyright c 2008 Mosby, Inc. There are numerous unproven theories of allergic disease that include allergic toxemia, multiple chemical sensitivity and candida hypersensitivity syndrome. These theories have in common a broad range of symptoms, presum ed sensitivity of the offending agent, a delay in onset of symptoms after exposure, and lack of evidence for the pathogenesis of these diseases. Testing for these diagnoses includes unproven procedures su ch as specific IgG antibodies to food or environmental allergens, food immune complexes, chemical analysis of body fluids and tissues, pulse test, cytotoxic tests, end-point titration, provocation-neutraliz ation, electroderm al testing and applied kinesiology. Proponents of these theories will make patients go through extreme measures to eliminate contact with an extensive list of e nvironmental chemicals or to avoid multiple foods especially without appropri ate testing or evaluation.

The need to represent the middle ear anatomy by means of virtual endoscopy arose from the increased interest of otolarygologists in transtympanic endoscopy. In fact, this imaging method allows the visualization of middle ear 107anatomy with high detail, but it is evasive and is essentially u sed for surgical guidance. Virtual endoscopy provides similar perspectives of the ty mpanic cavity but does not require the tympanic perforation. In the study of the mi ddle ear, specific attention is give n to the retroperitoneum. This region contains elevations of the medial wall (pyramidal eminence and ridge, styloid eminence and ridge, subiculum, ponticulus) and depressions (sinus tympani, posterior sinus tympani, facial sinus, fossula of Grivot, oval window fossula), which can be effectively disp layed by virtual endoscopy. Virtual endoscopy is foreseen as a useful tool in preoperative management of patients who are candidates for middle ear surgery, since it can pr edict with high detail the patient's specific anatomy by imaging perspectives familiar to otosurgeons.

Creation of a three-dimensional mode l of human segmental lung anatomy AJR. American Journal of Roentgenology. 174(5):1333-6, 2000 OBJECTIVE: The investigation of pulmonary em bolism using scintigraphic tomography requires a model of the internal architecture of the segm ents and subsegments in the human lung. Such a model has been developed by the segmentation and subsegmentation of an existing whole-body tissue-segmented phantom. MATERIALS AND METH ODS: By using information from suitably windowed human axial CT scans, combined with the information gained from the injection of color-coded dyes into the segmental bronchi of human cadaveric lungs, the lobar and segmental boundaries were added to the existing phantom. Furt her refinements were added from reports in the literature regarding the pre dominant pattern of subsegmental bronchi in a series of human cadavers, enabling the creation of subsegmental boundaries. RESULT S: A digitized model of the segmental and subsegmental anatomy of the hum an lung was successfully created. External, or pleural, projections of the complex internal arrangement of the segm ents closely corresponded with the projections of the best available au thorities on the subject. CONCLUSION: The model provides the opportunity to addres s several issues germane to sc intigraphy and important for diagnosing pulmonary embolic disease. In particul ar, the model allows th e manipulation of three- dimensional data sets to explore issues of importance to tomographic lung scanning. CUTTING EDGE: Kitaoka H, Nieman GF, Carney D, Kawase I A 4-dimensional model of Physiological branching duct system with alveolar openings, is one of the most complicated structures in the living body. Although its deformation during ventilation is the 108basic knowledge for lung physiolog y, there has b een no consensus on it because of technical difficulties of dynamic 3-dimensional observation in vivo. It is known that the alveolar duct wall (primary septa) in the fetal lung is deformed so as to obtain the largest inner space and the widest surface area, and that the secondary septa grow ju st before birth and their free ridges form the alveolar entrance rings (mouths) containing abunda nt elastin fibers. We have constructed a 4- dimensional alveolar model according to this morphogenetic process, where the alveolar deformation is modeled by a combination of springs and hinges, corresponding to elastin fibers at alveolar mouths and junctions of alveolar septa, respectively. The model includes a hypothesis that alveolar mouths are closed at minimum volume and that closed alveoli are stabilized by the alveolar lining liquid film containing a surfactant. Morphometric characteristics of the model were consistent with previous reports. Furthermore, the model explained how th e alveolar number and size could change during ventilation. Using in vivo microscopy, we validated our model by an analysis of the dynamic inflation and deflation of subpleural alveoli. Our model, including the alveolar mouth-closure hypothesis, can explain the origin of phase IV in a single breath nitrogen washout curve (closing volume) and mechanis m of alveolar recrui tment/derecruitment. REVIEW: Fahy, R J. the human cathelicidin hCAP-18/LL-37 Immunologic Research. 31(2):75-89, 2005 Antimicrobial peptides form an important co mponent of the innate immune system. The cathelicidin family, a key member of the anti microbial peptide defenses, has been highly conserved throughout evolution. Th ough widespread in mammals, there is currently only one identified human example, hCAP-18/LL-37. The cathelicidins have been found to have multiple functions, in addition to their known antimicrobial and lipopolysaccharide-neutralizing effects. As a result, they profoundly affect both innate and adaptive imm unity. Currently, antimicrobial peptides are being evaluated as th erapeutic drugs in disease states as diverse as oral mucositis, cystic fibrosis, and septic shock. One such peptid e, the cathelicidin hCAP-18/LL-37, is reviewed in detail in the context of its role in lung physiology and defense. 3. Skin REVIEW: Wysocki, A B. Skin anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology Nursing Clinics of North America. 34(4):777-97, 1999 Human skin is the largest multifunctional organ of the body, and knowledge of its structure and function is essential to clinicia ns and researchers. The skin ha s two layers, the epidermis and dermis, separated by a basement membrane zone. It provides protection, sensation, thermoregulation, biochemical/metabolic, and immune functions. Key and emerging concepts important to understanding pat hophysiological mechanisms for practicing clinicians are: knowledge of differences between acute and chroni c wounds; ability to evaluate depth and extent of injury; understanding stages of healing versus zones of activ ity; and knowledge of ischemic- reperfusion injury, the sk in immune system, cytokines, growth factors and other biomolecules, and matrix synthesis and degradation. These c oncepts are addressed in this article. CUTTING EDGE: 109Xue M, Campbell D, Jackson CJ Protein C is an autocrine grow th fa ctor for human skin keratinocytes. Journal of Biological Ch emistry. 282(18):13610-6, 2007 The protein C (PC) pathway plays an important role in coagulation and inflammation. Many components of the PC pathway have been iden tified in epidermal ke ratinocytes, including endothelial protein C receptor (EP CR), which is the specific recepto r for PC/activated PC (APC), but the core member of this pathway, PC, and its function in keratinocytes has not been defined. In this study, we reveal that PC is strongly e xpressed by human keratinocytes at both gene and protein levels. When endogenous PC was blocked by siRNA the proliferation of keratinocytes was significantly decreased. This inhibi tory effect was restored by the addition of recombinant APC. PC siRNA treatment also increased cell apoptosis by 3-fold and inhibited cell migration by more than 20%. When keratinocytes were pretreat ed with RCR252, an EPCR-blocking antibody, or PD153035, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF R) inhibitor, cell pro liferation was hindered by more than 30%. These inhibitors also comp letely abolished recombinant APC (10 mug/ml)- stimulated proliferation. Blocking PC expression or inhibiting its binding to EPCR/EGFR decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but incr eased p38 activation. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK decreased cell proliferation by approximately 30% and completely abolished the stimulatory effect of APC on proliferation. Taken together, these results indica te that keratinocyte-derived PC promotes cell survival, growth, and migration in an autocrine manner via EPCR, EGFR, and activation of ERK1/2. Our results highlight a novel role for th e PC pathway in normal skin physiology and wound healing. 4. Gastrointestinal Tract REVIEW: Kararli, T Comparison of the gastrointestinal anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry of humans and commonly used laboratory animals. Biopharmaceutics & Drug Di sposition. 16(5):351-80, 1995 Jul In addition to metabolic differences, the anatomi cal, physiological, and bioc hemical differences in the gastrointestinal (G.I.) tract of the human and common laboratory anim als can cause significant variation in drug absorption from the oral route. Among the physiological factors, pH, bile, pancreatic juice, and mucus and fluid volume and content can modify dissolution rates, solubility, transit times, and membrane trans port of drug molecules. The microbi al content of the G.I. tract can significantly affect the reductive metabolis m and enterohepatic circulation of drugs and colonic delivery of formulations . The transit time of dosage forms can be significantly different between species due to different dimensions and propulsive activ ities of the G.I. tract. The lipid/protein composition of the enterocyte membrane along th e G.I. tract can alter binding and passive, active, and carrier-mediated transport of drugs. The location and number of Peyer's patches can also be important in the absorption of large molecules and particulate matter. While small animals, rats, mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits, are most suitable for determining the mechanism of drug absorption and bioavailability values from pow der or solution formulations, larger animals, dogs, pigs, and monkeys, are us ed to assess absorption from formulations. The understanding of physiological, anat omical, and biochemical differences between the G.I. tracts of different animal species can lead to the selec tion of the correct animal model to mimic the bioavailability of compounds in the human. This article review s the anatomical, physiological, and biochemical differences between the G.I. tracts of humans and commonly used laboratory animals. 110 REVIEW: Wershil BK. Furuta GT Gastrointest inal mucosal & Clinic Immunology. 121(2 Suppl):S380-3 Mucosal surfaces constitute a large host-environmental interface that must be protected from pathogenic organisms. The mucosal immune syst em has evolved as a distinct immune organ functioning independently from its systemic c ounterpart. The mucosal immune system has the difficult task of mounting protec tive responses to invading micr oorganisms while maintaining a state of nonresponsiveness to commensal bacter ia and food antigens. The system has unique cellular components and functi onal aspects that permit it to carry out this dual role. 5. Lymphoid Tissue REVIEW: Muthuchamy M . Zawieja D Molecular regulation of lymphatic contractility. Annals of the New Yor k Academy of Sciences. 1131:89-99, 2008 The lymphatic system plays critical roles in body fluid and macromolecular homeostasis, lipid absorption, immune function, and metastasis. To accomplish these tasks, the lymphatics must move lymph and its contents from the intersti tial space through the lymph vessels and nodes and into the great veins. Contrary to popular belief, lymph does not passively \"drain\" down this pathway, because the net pressure gradients oppose flow. Instead, th e lymphatics must act as both the conduits that direct and re gulate lymph flow and the pumps that generate the lymph flow. Thus, to regulate lymph transport and function, both lymphatic pumping and flow resistance must be controlled. Both of these processes occur via regulation of lymphatic muscle contractions, which are classically thought to occur via the inter action of cell calcium with regulatory and contractile proteins. However, our knowledge of this regulation of lymphatic contractile function is far from complete. In this ch apter we review our understandi ng of the important molecular mechanisms, the calcium regulation, and the contra ctile/regulatory proteins that control lymphatic contractions. A better understa nding of these mechanisms could provide the basis for the development of better diagnostic and treatmen t modalities for lympha tic dysfunction. While progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular biology of lymphangiogenesis as a result of the development of potential lymphangi ogenic therapeutic targets, there are currently no therapeutic agents that speci fically modulate lym phatic pump function and lymph flow via lymphatic muscle. However, their development w ill not be possible until the molecular basis of lymphatic contractility is more fully understood. REVIEW: Cesta MF Normal structure, function, and histol ogy of lymphoid tissue Toxicologic Pathology. 34(5):599-608, 2006 The mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) initiates immune responses to specific antigens encountered along all mucosal surfaces. MALT inductive sites are secondary immune tissues where antigen sampling occurs and immune responses are initiated. Effector sites, present as diffuse lymphoid tissue along all mucosal surfaces ar e the sites of IgA tran sport across the mucosal epithelium. Though there are many differences between inductive sites in various organs, they all 111contain the same basic com partments-follicles, inte rfollicular dome regions, and follicle-associated The morphologic differences between MALT and other secondary lymphoid tissues, betwee n the MALT sites of differing anatomic locations, and species differences among laboratory animals are de scribed. The morphologic changes in MALT associated with aging, route of nutrition, and genetic mutation (i.e., the nude and SCID mutations) are also discussed. MALT tissues comprise th e mucosal immune system which can function independently of the systemic immune system and are, therefore, an important and often overlooked aspect of immunopathology. B. Pathology of primary atopic disorders 1. Asthma (including airway remodeling) a. Children REVIEW: Apter AJ, Szefler SJ Advances in adult and pediatric asthma J Allergy Clin Immunol 2004;113:407-414 This review summarizes the highlights in the stud y of adult and pediatric asthma from October 2002 through October 2003. It is eas iest to categorize this year's advances into physiologic, epidemiologic, therapeutic, and primarily pediatric developments. In phys iology the identification of the ADAM33 gene as an asthma susceptibility gene has led to a ne w hypothesis concerning the pathogenesis of asthma. Understa nding the integration of the upper and lower airway s is likely to have important implications for patient management . Epidemiologic studies continue to show that asthma is a significant and costly disease, with medications comprising the most significant direct costs. Early intervention and improved management can significantly reduce the burden of illness. Research presented indicates there is an opportu nity for allergist-imm unologists to improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to as thma management. Our community has a strong commitment to health care quality, educati on, and delivery. The Journal will reflect this commitment with a new secti on devoted to these issues. REVIEW: Spahn JD, Szefler SJ Childhood J Allergy Clin Immunol 2002;109:3-13 Recently, a concerted effort has been made to reverse the trend of increasing asthma mortality and morbidity. One additional strategy might be to rec ognize patients at risk for persistent asthma and to intervene early. This review summarizes new information on asthma pathogenesis that has helped shape a new direction in managing childh ood asthma. At the core is the recognition that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease. Subs equently, inhaled steroids , the most potent anti- inflammatory asthma medications, have emerge d as the cornerstone of the management of persistent asthma. The recent report of the Na tional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Childhood Asthma Management Program provides a comprehens ive \"profile of performance\" for 3 treatment choices for the management of persistent asth ma. This study answers questions regarding the benefits and shortcomings of the medications ev aluated and prompts a closer evaluation of the long-term effects of other treatment strategies , including medications currently being developed. 112Although intervention with inhaled steroids offers new opportunities to cont rol the development of asthma , one must be cognizant of potential risks in early and long-term therapeutic intervention. This review provides a perspective on our pres ent knowledge, the rationale for early intervention, and opportunities for more aggressive thera py, as well as speculation on how ongoing clinical research will continue to play a role in advanc ing asthma care and moving toward a \"cure\" for this life-threatening disease. b. Adults PRACTICE PARAMETER: Li JT, Oppenheimer J, Bernstein IL Attaining optimal asthma control: A practice parameter J Allergy Clin Immunol 2005;116:S3-S11 MANAGEMENT GUIDELINE: National Asthma Education and Prevention Progr am Expert Panel Report 2: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma & Update 2002: Expert Panel Report http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/index.htm REVIEW: Busse WW, Banks-Schlegel S, asthma J Allergy Clin Immunol 2000;106:1033-1042. Although asthma affects nearly 8% of the adult population, most of these patients have mild-to- moderate disease that can be cont rolled with appropriate treatment. It is estimated, however, that 5% to 10% of patients with asthma have severe disease that is unr esponsive to typical therapeutics, including corticosteroids. Because patients with severe asthma are disproportionately affected by their disease, in terms of both impaired lifestyle and health care costs, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute sponsored a workshop on the pathogenesis of severe asthma. The goals of this workshop were to begin to define the characterist ics of severe asthma. In these discussions, it was clear that many characteristics need to be cons idered in defining this phenotype of asthma, including symptoms, intensity of therapy (includi ng administration of systemic corticosteroids), and impairment of lung function. Also discussed were potential mechanisms of severe asthma including the role of allergic diseases, which may play less of a role in severe asthma than in mild-to-moderate disease, and infections. A major lim itation to control of severe asthma is the recalcitrant response of these patients to usual therapy including systemic corticosteroids; the potential of other therapies wa s reviewed. From these discussions, recommendations were made for future research needs to gain insights into a difficult therapeutic and possibly novel mechanistic area of asthma. 2. Rhinitis and rhinosinusitis a. Allergic LANDMARK PAPER: Meltzer EO, Hamilos DL, Hadley JA, et al Rhinosinusitis: Establishing definitions for clinical research and patient care J Allergy Clin Immunol 2004;114:155-212) 113BACKGROUND: There is a need for m ore research on all forms of rhinosinusitis. Progress in this area has been hampered by a lack of consensus definitions and the limited number of published clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: To develop consen sus definitions for rhinosinusitis and outline strategies useful in cl inical trials. METHODS: Five national societies, The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; The Ameri can Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy; The American Academy of Otolaryngo logy Head and Neck Surgery; The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; and the American Rhinologic Society formed an expert panel from multiple disciplines. Over two days, the panel developed definitions for rhinosinusitis and outlined strategies for design of clinical trials. RESULTS: Committee members agreed to adopt the term \"rhinosinusitis\" and reached consensus on defi nitions and strategies for clinical research on acute presumed bacterial rhinosinusitis, chro nic rhinosinusitis without alle rgic fungal rhinosinusi tis. Symptom and objective criteria, measures for monitoring research progre ss, and use of symptom scoring tools, quality-of- life instruments, radiologic studies, and rhinosco pic assessment were outlined for each condition. Conclusion -The recommendations from this conf erence should improve accuracy of clinical diagnosis and serve as a star ting point for design of rhi nosinusitis clinical trials REVIEW: Borish L Allergic rhinitis: Systemic inflammati on and implications for management J Allergy Clin Immunol 2003;112:1021-1031 Allergic rhinitis triggers a systemic increase of inflammation. Within minutes of allergen exposure, immune cells release histamine, proteases, cystei nyl leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and cytokines. Some produce the early symptoms, while others a ugment the production, systemic circulation, and subsequent infiltration of the nasal mucosa with inflammatory cells that sustain the symptoms. Systemic circulation of inflammatory cells perm its their infiltration into other tissues where chemoattractant and adhesion molecules already exist. Consequently, allergic rhinitis is otitis media. Effective therapy should be directed at underlying inflammation and its systemic manifestations. It should improve the rhinitis and the comorbid conditions. Antihistamines relieve early symptoms by blocking basophil- and mast cell-generated histamine, but they do not significantly influence the pro-in flammatory loop. They are often little better than placebo. Oral corticosteroids provide the systemic anti-inflammatory effi cacy, but their toxicity precludes such an approach. Intr anasal corticosteroids effectively target the local inflammatory processes of rhinitis, reducing local inflammatory cells within the nares, but they do not directly access tissues involved in the comorbid conditions. Leukotriene modifiers have both systemic anti- inflammatory effects and an acceptable safety profile. REVIEW: Skoner DP Allergic rhinitis: Definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, detect diagnosis J Allergy Clin Immunol 2001;108:2S-8S Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a heterogeneous disorder that despite its high prevalence is often undiagnosed. It is characterized by one or more symptoms including sneezing, itching, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea. Many causative agents ha ve been linked to AR including pollens, molds, dust mites, and animal dander. Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) is fairly easy to identify 114because of the rapid and reproducible onset and o ffset of symptoms in association w ith pollen exposure. Perennial AR is often more difficult to detect than SAR because of the overlap with sinusitis, respiratory infections, and vasomotor rhinitis. SAR can result in hyperresponsiveness to allergens such as cigarette smoke, once pollen season is over. Perennial AR is defined as occurring during approximately 9 months of the year. AR affects an estimated 20 to 40 million people in the United States alone, and the incidence is increasi ng; an estimated 20% of cases are SAR; 40% of cases are perennial rhinitis; a nd 40% of cases are mixed. The pa thophysiology of SAR is complex. There is a strong genetic component to the alle rgic response, which is driven through mucosal infiltration and action on plasma cells, mast cells, and eosinophils. The allergic response occurs in two phases, which are considered the \"early\" and \"late\" phase responses. Early phase response occurs within minutes of exposur e to the allergen a nd tends to produce sneezing, itching, and clear rhinorrhea; late phase response occurs 4 to 8 hour s after allergen exposure and is characterized by congestion, fatigue, malaise, irritability, and possi bly neurocognitive deficits. The key to diagnosis of AR is awareness of signs and symptoms. IgE antibody tests to detect sp ecific allergens are the standard method used today; however, in addition, diagnosis must be confirmed with a positive history and demonstration that the symptoms are the result of IgE-mediated inflammation. b. Infectious PRACTICE PARAMETER: Slavin RG, Spector SL, Bernstein IL, et al The diagnosis and management of sinusitis: A practice parameter update J Allergy Clin Immunol 2005;116:S13-47. Sinusitis is one of the most commonly diagnosed diseases in the United States, affecting an estimated 16% of the adult population annually. It extracts an overall direct annual health care cost of $5.8 billion. Total restricted activity days increased from 50 million per year during 1986 through 1988 to 73 million per year during 1990 thr ough 1992. Sinusitis also significantly affects quality of life in some symptom domains even more than other chronic diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, angina, and back pain.Because of the importance of sinusitis, the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters, represen ting the American Academ y of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology,devel oped the first set of ''Parameters for the diagnosisand management of sinusitis,'' whic h was published in 1998.3 Much has happened since then with respect to new concepts in dia gnosis and management and new insights into pathogenesis. For these reasons, it was deci ded that a revision- update was indicated. c. Nonallergic REVIEW: Ciprandi D nonallergic perennial rhinitis Allergy 2004;76:16-22. Nonallergic perennial rhinitis (a lso commonly referred to as vasomotor rhinitis) is a chronic non- IgE-mediated condition that is characterized by symptoms which are similar to those seen in allergic rhinitis, but which persist for over ni ne months each year. Although treatment of vasomotor rhinitis involves the use of either in tranasal corticosteroids or antihistamines, the corticosteroids are generally not effective in trea tment of all the symptoms of vasomotor rhinitis 115and have generally been shown to be effective in patients with eosinophilia. With the exception of azelastine, the only top ical antihistamine to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of nonallergic rhinitis, the antihistamines have also produced in consistent results. While clinical studies of azelastine have demonstrated that this drug is highly efficacious in the treatment of all the symptoms of vasomotor rhinitis, mechanistic studies have demonstrated that azelastine has potent anti-inflammatory effects (i n particular attenuation of the e xpression and synthesis of pro- inflammatory cytokines, leukotrien es, and cell adhesion molecules), which are likely to contribute to its clinical efficacy. Furtherm ore, pharamacokinetic studies have suggested that since azelastine has a more rapid onset of action, compared to most other antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids, then azelastine na sal spray may be considered as primary therapy for patients with symptoms of both allergic and/or vaso motor (nonallergic perennial) rhinitis. REVIEW: Novak N, Bieber T Allergic and nonallergic fo atopic Allergy Clin Atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma are atopic diseases that develop on a complex genetic background, the so-called atop ic diathesis. Although they target different organs, in most patients they are characterized by the presence of elevated total serum IgE levels. However, a subgroup of atopic patients exhibits normal IgE le vels and mechanisms contributing to the so- called \"intrinsic\" or \"nonallergic form\" have been the matter of intensive research work in the last years. Because of the rapid advancements in the research field of atopic diseases, it now becomes possible for the first time to delineate a new di sease classification of allergic and nonallergic subtypes of atopic diseases, there by bringing hope to the clinician for a more specific treatment approach for each subgroup of these patients. REVIEW: Leynaert B, Bousquet J, Neukirch C, et al. Perennial rhinitis:An independent risk factor for asthma in nonatopic subjects: Results from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey J Allergy Clin Immunol 1999;104:301-304 BACKGROUND: Although clini cal and experimental studies suggest that upper respiratory tract dysfunction may affect the lower airways, rhinitis is usually not studied as a potential risk factor for asthma. This is because both diseases shar e key elements of pathogenesis and are usually considered as different manifestations of the same underlying \"atopic\" state. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess whether asthma is associated with rhinitis in the absence of immunologic disorders in a population study. MET HODS: Data from 34 centers participating in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey were an alyzed. Random samples of 20- to 44-year-old subjects were invited to complete a detailed questionnaire and undergo total and specific IgE measurements, skin prick tests to 9 allerg ens, and bronchoprovocation challenges with methacholine. RESULTS: Subjects with perennial rhinitis (n = 1412) were more likely than control subjects (n = 5198) to ha ve current asthma. After adjustme nt for sex, age, smoking habit, family history of asthma, geographic area, and season at the time of examination, asthma was strongly associated with rhini tis among atopic subjects (odds ra tio [OR] = 8.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.4-12.1) but al so among nonatopic subjects (OR = 11.6; 95% CI = 6.2-21.9). Moreover, the association remained very strong wh en the analysis was re stricted to nonatopic 116subjects with IgE levels of 80 kIU/L or less (OR = 13.3; 95% CI = 6. 7-26.5). In nonasthmatic subjects bronchial hyperresponsiven ess was also mo re frequent in subjects with rhinitis than in those without rhinitis (OR = 1.7; 95%CI = 1.2-2.6 in nonatopic subjects with IgE levels of </=80 kIU/L). CONCLUSION: The strong association between perennial rhinitis and asthma in nonatopic subjects with normal IgE levels is cons istent with the hypothesis that rhinitis is an independent risk factor for asthma. d. Nasal polyps POSITION PAPER: Fokkens W, Lund V, Bachert C EAACI position paper on rhinosinusitis and nasal summary Allergy 2005; 2005;1:77-84 These guidelines are modified from the recent EAACI Position Paper. Nasal polyposis is characterized by an inflammatory process, th e factors of which are summarized. Recently, Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins have been identified to modify the disease. A classification system for polyps, grading systems and epidemiol ogic data are given, frequent comorbidities are discussed. The diagnostic management is based on endoscopy and CT scanning. A score of severity is proposed. The therapeutic management consists of the medical treatment options, which are given with evidence-based recommendations. Surg ical treatment is indicated after failure of medical treatment and commonly performed by endos copy. Nevertheless medical therapy must be continued after surgery to prevent recurrences . Algorithms of decision are finally proposed REVIEW: Bikhazi disease process resulting in a common pathologic structure. Better understanding of the pathophysiology has resu lted in improved protocols for treatment. Different causes of polyposis are discussed with attention to both medical and surgical therapy. Recent advances in aspirin desensitization are detailed. REVIEW: Watanabe, Shirasaki, Kanaizumi and Himi, Effects of glucocorticoids on infiltrating cells and epithelial cells nasal polyps, Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol; 2004;113, 465-73, Glucocorticoids are known to be effective in the treatment of nasal polyps (NPs). To examine the mechanisms of their effect, we ev aluated 1) the ability of glucocorticoids to induce the apoptosis of eosinophils and T lymp hocytes in NPs, and 2) the ability of dexamethasone to down-regulate epithelial cell functions that re late to eosinophilic inflammation. In vitro and in vivo, glucocor ticoids increased the apoptosis of both eosinophils and T lymphocytes in NPs. De xamethasone inhibited the production of 117granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating f actor (GM-CSF) from both NP epithelial cells that were unstimulated and NP epithelial cells that were stimulated with interleukin- 4 or tumor necrosis factor alpha. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of glucocorticoids on NPs may be due to 1) indu ction of apoptosis in both eosinophils and T lymphocytes that infiltrate NPs, and 2) down-regulation of epithelial GM-CSF production, which prolongs survival. KEY CLINICAL TRIAL: Blomqvist EH, Lundblad L, Anggard A et al A randomized controlled study evaluating medical treatment versus surgical treatment in addition to me dical treatment of nasal polyposis. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2001;107:224-8. BACKGROUND: Controlled prospective studies ar e needed to determine whether surgical treatment in fact has an effect additive to that of medical treatment of nasal polyposis. OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the effect of medical treatment versus combined surgical and medical treatment on olfaction, polyp score, and symptoms in nasal nasal were randomized to unilateral endoscopic sinus surgery after pretreatment with oral prednisolone for 10 days and local nasal budesonide bilaterally for 1 month. Postoperatively, patients we re given local nasal steroids (budesonide). Patients were evaluated with nasal endoscopy, symptom scores, and olfactory thresholds. They were followed for 12 months. RESULTS: The sense of smell was improved by the combination of local and oral steroids. Surgery had no additional effect. Symptom scores improved significantly with medical treatment alone , but surgery had additional beneficial effects on nasal obstruction and secretion. After surgery, the polyp score decreased significantly on the operated side but remained the same on the unoperat ed side. Twenty-five pe rcent of the patients were willing to undergo an operation also on the unoperated side at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Medical treatment seems to be su fficient to treat most symptoms of nasal polyposis. When hyposmia is the primary symptom, no additional benefit seems to be gained from surgical treatment. If nasal obstruction is th e main problem after steroid treatment, surgical treatment is indicated. Selecti on of those who will benefit from surgery should be based on the patient's symptoms and not on the examiner's polyp score. KEY CLINICAL TRIAL: Hissaria P, Smith W, Wormald PJ et al Short course of systemic corticosteroids in si nonasal polyposis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial measures J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006;118:128-33 BACKGROUND: Topical and systemic corticostero ids are the first choice in medical treatments for sinonasal polyposis, but surprisi ngly, there is no for the efficacy of oral corticosteroids. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish the efficacy of a short course of oral prednisolone in ameliorating the symp toms of sinonasal polyposis, as well as reducing mucosal inflammation assessed by means of nasendoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A secondary aim was to evaluate the re lationship between outcome measures. METHODS: Subjects with symptomatic endoscopically di agnosed sinonasal polyposis received 50 mg of prednisolone daily for 14 days or placebo. Outc ome was quantified by using the modified 31-item Rhinosinusitis Outcome Measure questionnaire , physician's assessment, nasendoscopy with 118photography, and MRI. RESULTS: There were 20 subjects in each treatme nt group. Only the prednisolone-treated group show ed significant improvement in nasal symptoms (P < .001). The Rhinosinusitis Outcome Measure score improved in both groups, but the prednisolone-treated group had significantly greater improvement than the placebo group (P < . 001). Objectively, there was significant reduction in polyp size, as not ed with nasendoscopy (P < .001) and MRI (P < .001), only in the prednisolone-treated group. The outcome measures correlated with each other; the highest level of correlation was between the objective measures of nasendoscopy and MRI (R(2) = 0.76, P < .001). There were no significant adverse events. CONCLUSION: This trial clearly establishes clinically significant improvement in the symptoms and pathology of sinonasal polyposis with a short course of systemic co rticosteroids. MRI s canning and quantitative nasendoscopic photography are objectiv e and valid tools for assessing the outcome of treatment in this condition. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: A 14-day course of 50 mg of prednisolone is safe and effective therapy for symptomatic nasal polyposis. Bikhazi proces s resulting in a common pathologic structure.

These results suggest th at the clinical efficacy of glucocorticoids on NPs may be due to 1) induction of apoptosis in both eosinophils and T lymphocytes that infiltrate NPs, and 2) down-regulation of epithelial GM-CSF production, which prolongs eosinophil survival. RESEARCH Bernstein, Lymphocyte subpopulations and cytokines in nasal polyps: is local immune system Otolaryngol nasal known. The present study ev aluates the lymphocyte subpopulations and their 119production of a technique de tection of intracytoplasmic cytokines by flow cytom etry. This information may allow us to dete rmine whether the source of these lymphocytes is from peripheral blood, the common mucosal immune system, or both. METHODS: Detection of intracytoplasmic cytokines by flow cytometry wa s performed using a monoclonal antibody rhodamine-labeled intracytoplasmic monoclonal antibody directed against four cytokines. In this the percentage of lymphocytes synthesizing lymphocytes and corresponding peripheral blood of 13 patients. RESULTS: Lymphocytes producing interferon-gamma and IL-2, as well as IL-4 and IL-5, were found in the nasal polyps, suggesting that the nasal polyp possesses both TH1 and TH2 cy tokine expression. There are also significant differences between the percen tage of lymphocytes producing these cytokines between nasal polyps and peripheral blood, suggesting that nasal polyp lymphocytes derive from at least another source than only peripheral blood ly mphocytes. Statistical analysis of four groups of patients demonstrated that no statistically significant di fference in the lymphocyte subpopulations in aspirin-tole rant patients. In general, CD8 cells always produce more interferon-gamma than IL-2 in both peripheral blood and nasal polyps. In contrast with this data, CD4 cells produce mo re IL-2 in the peripher al blood than in nasal polyps. CONCLUSIONS: Data support the concep t that nasal polyp lymphocyte subpopulations may be derived from both the local mucosal imm une system as well as from random migration of peripheral blood lymphocytes secondary to adhesion molecules and chemokines, which are known to be present in nasal polyps 3.

OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on the uses of nasal provocation testing (NPT) for scientific investigations of the mechanisms of allergic and nonallergic rhinitis . It also describes the use of NPT as a diagnostic tool in clinical practice. The indications, contraindi cations, advantages, and limitations of different techniques for evaluati on of nasal responses ar e reviewed. The paper familiarizes investigators with particulars of diffe rent nasal delivery systems, provocation agents, nasal patency measurements, secr etion collection, and nasal lava ge techniques. DATA SOURCES: Relevant publications obtained from a lite rature review. STUDY S ELECTION: Relevant publications on the topics of NPT, allergic, and n onallergic rhinitis were critically evaluated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: To date, NPT has been used primarily as a research tool for the investigation of allergic and nonallergic rhinitis with a wide va riety of techniques depending on the specific scientific purposes. NPT will continue to provide useful information about the pathogenesis of airway diseases. Standardized nasal provocation testing has the potential to become a more frequently used clinical test in the diagnosis of allergic and occ upational rhinitis and for determination of the a ppropriate and focused therapy.

Contribution of allergen-specifi c and nonspecific nasal responses to early- phase and late-phase nasal responses. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2008 Ma r;121(3):718-24. Epub 2007 Dec 21. relative contributions of the allerg en-specific early-phase nasal response and nonspecific nasal response cells to the pathophysiology of alle rgic rhinitis are not well defined. OBJECTIVES : To determine the contributions of specific reactivity, nonspecific reactivity, and mast cells to the development of early-phase and late-phase responses using a mouse model of allergic rhinitis. METHODS : Sensitized wild-type and FcvarepsilonRI-deficient (FcvarepsilonRI-/-) mice were expos ed to allergen for 3, 5, or 12 days. As indicators of nasal reactivity, respiratory frequency and na sal resistance were monitored. RESULTS : Sensitized mice exposed to 3 days of nasal allergen challenge showed a nonspecific early-phase response. As the number of allergen exposures increased, there wa s progressive diminution in nonspecific responses with increased allergen-specific early-phase re sponses and a late-phase response. Sensitized FcvarepsilonRI-/- did not de velop nonspecific nasal responses or late-phase responses, but transfer of in vitro-differentiated wild-type mast cells into FcvarepsilonRI-/- mice restored nonspecific early-phase nasal responses but not the late-phase response. CONCLUSION : These data identify the nonspecific nasal response as a major contributor to the early-phase response, especially during initial allergen exposure, and is dependent on mast cells. Increasing allergen exposure results in increasing allergen-specific responses, converting the nonspecific early-phase response to a late-phase response that is allergen-specific and mast cell-independent. 121 REVIEW: Malm, l, Gerth van Wijk R, Bachert on nasal patency, airflow , and airflow resistance.

Rhinology. 2000;38:1-6 Under the auspices of the International Rhinol ogic Society (IRS) ther e is an 'International Committee on Objective Assessment of the Nasal Airways'. In 1984 Rhinology published the Committee's recommendations regarding rhinomanometry (Clement, 1984). During the last Congresses of the European Rhinologic Society (ERS) a subcommittee within that committee has discussed nasal provocations a nd the value of measuring nasa l patency, airflow and airflow resistance to evaluate such provocations. The follow ing is an effort to a consensus of indications and techniques for nasal provocation and to a criti cal analysis of methods to measure the effects. Only the most known methods will be discussed, i. e. acoustic rhinometry, rhinostereometry, nasal peak airflow and rhinomanometry with its diffe rent techniques. For graded responses after provocations the use of such methods is of clinic al value only in combination with scores from symptoms such as sneezes and secretion, as allergic rhinitis symptoms consist of obstruction, sneezing, itching and concomitant symptoms of the neighbouring organs. For research all methods can be recommended to be used an d their respective value is depending on the specific scientific purposes. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Nakaya M ,Dohi M , Okunishi sitivity in murine allergic rhinitis. Lab Invest. 2006;86:917-26 Until now there has been no method for physiologically evaluating nasal hypersensitivity in mice.Enhanced pause (Penh) has been used as an indicator that reflects changes in the lower airway. Recently, however, there is disagreement regarding the significance of the Penh system; this isbecause Penh is not essentially a physiological parameter, and it might not necessarily represent a change in the lower re spiratory tract. The pur pose of the present study is to investigate whether Penh could be applicable for analyzing nasal hypersensitivity in mice. BALB/c mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) through a combin ation of intraperitoneal injection and daily intranasal challenge in an awake condition. Penh was measured at each time point during sensitization, or a serial change in Penh value was followed after the fina l nasal challenge and the effect of treatment was assessed. Following sens itization and nasal chal lenge, the Penh value gradually increased and showed a significant difference on day 14. Changes in IgE, eosinophil infiltration into nasal mucosa, and OVA-induced symptoms all strongly correlated with the increase in Penh. On day 19, after OVA nasal prov ocation, Penh gradually increased and reached maximal values 25 min after the challenge. Pretreatment with dexamethasone or a histamine H1 blocker significantly suppressed this increase in Penh. We confirmed that intranasal OVA challenge did not induce bronchocon striction by measuring airway resistance and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, andthrough histolog ical examination. These results clearly demonstr ate that Penh could be a useful noninvasive indica tor for studying nasa l hypersensitivity. 122LANDMARK PUBLICATION: Raphael GD, Igarashi Y, White MV, Sources of characterized by a profuse rhinorrhea in addition to paroxysms of sneezing, nasal congestion, and pruritus. To define better the sources of nasal secretion produced during rhinitis, nasal allergen challenges were performed on nine atopic subjects w ith seasonal rhinitis. A single dose of allergen was spraye d into one side of the nose, and nasal lavages were collected bilaterally for 7 hours. Nasal lavages were assaye d for protein (total prot ein, albumin, lactoferrin, and lysozyme) and mediator (histamine and prostaglandin D2) content. Protein concentrations increased and remained elevated above baseline levels in both ipsilateral and contralateral secretions for up to 3 hours afte r allergen challenge. The propor tion of albumin relative to total protein (the albumin percent) in creased on the ipsilateral side, whereas the relative proportions of lactoferrin and lysozyme (the lactoferrin percent and lysozy me percent) increased on the contralateral side. Prostaglandin D 2, but not histamine, increased se lectively on the ipsilateral side. These data suggest that the ipsila teral protein secretory response is due to allergen-induced mast cell mediator release causing increased vascular permeability, whereas the contralateral protein secretory response is primarily a reflex-induced glandular secretion.

BACKGROUND : Although nasal challenge with allergen has often been used to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic modalities used for the treatme nt of allergic rhinitis, the reproducibility of this model in quantitatively evaluating efficacy has not been rigorously examined. OBJECTIVE: To examine the reproducibility of the suppressive effects of an intranasal corticosteroid on the clinical a nd biochemical outcomes of a nasa l allergen challenge during two identical treatment periods usi ng the same subjects. METHODS: In a single-blind study, 25 seasonal allergic subjects with positive skin tests to grass or ragweed were studied outside of their pollen season. Subjects underwent a baseline, three-dose allergen challenge. Beginning 1 week later, subjects received two 7-day courses of intranasal beclometha sone challe nges with allergen each treatment period. The nasal alle rgic response was evaluated by counting sneezes, recording symptom scores and measuring levels of albumin (an index of vascular permeability), lysozyme nasal lavages. RESULTS: Compared with the baseline challenge, each course of beclomethasone significantly reduced sneezing, symptom scores, albumin and kinins, but not lysozyme. Reproducibility analysis of the net changes from diluent challenge in the two beclomethasone treatment periods, showed the following intracl ass correlation coeffici (0.28). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the nasal challenge model is a repr oducible method to evaluate the efficacy of anti- allergic medications. For nasal corticosteroid tr ials, sneezing, symptom scores and albumin levels are recommended as the most reproduc ibly OF REVIEW: To review bronchial provocations tests used in the measurement of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to help in the diagnosis of asthma. RECENT FINDINGS: The bronchial provocations tests revi ewed include exercise, methacholine, AMP and mannitol, with reference to methodology and mon itoring of treatment. SUMMARY : Methacholine is used for identifying bronchial hyperresponsiveness and to gui de treatment. Exercise is used as a bronchial provocation test because demonstrating prevention of exercise-induced asthma is an indication for use of a drug. Both of these tests are being used to study tolerance to be ta2 agonists. There is increasing use of eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea as a surrogate bronchial provocation test for exercise to identify exercise-induced asthma, par ticularly in athletes. For methacholine and AMP there is concern about the differe nt breathing patterns used to inhale these aerosols and the impact they have on the cutoff point for identifying bronchial hyperresponsiveness. A new test that uses a kit containing prepacked capsules of different doses of mannitol and a delive ry device is discussed. There is increasing interest in using tests that act indirectly by release of mediators because the bronchial hyperresponsiveness itself is an indicator of the presence of inflammation. Since treatment of inflammation leads to loss of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to i ndirect stimuli, these tests are well suited to identify success of treatment. REVIEW: Covar RA. Bronchoprovocation testing in asthma. Nov;27(4):633-49; vi-vii. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is an important feature of asthma and is useful in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication. It pr obably represents inherent elements of the disease process such as genetic predisposition, airway inflammation, and airway remodeling. Airway inflammation likely accounts for the variable component of BHR, whereas the persistent component of BHR correlates significantly with stru ctural changes in the airway, such as basement membrane thickness and epithelial damage. It might be this component that is resistant or refractory to the effects of available interventions. A few trials of immunomodulatory therapy have shown considerable improvements in markers of airw ay inflammation, without significantly modifying airway reactivity. Interventions to impact the more permanent feature of BHR are needed. LANDMARK PUBLICATION: Cockcroft DW, Murdock KY, Kirby J, Hargreave F. Prediction of airway responsiveness to allergen from skin sensitivity to allergen and airway responsiveness to histamine. Am Rev Respir Dis. 1987;135:264-7 Previous data have indicated that airway respons iveness to allergen, expressed as the provocation concentration causing a 20% FEV1 fall (PC 20), was dependent on nonallergic airway responsiveness (histamine PC20) and sensitivity to allergen (skin sens itivity or end-point titration). From retrospective data in 24 subjects, we de veloped a formula to pr edict allergen PC20 and examined its accuracy prospectiv ely in 26 new subjects undergoing allergen inhalation test with doubling allergen predicted from histamine PC20) = 0.69 (r = 0.85). Allergen PC20 was accurately predicted in 6, and overestimated or underestimated by 1 doubling concentration in 11, by 2 concentrati ons in 6, by 3 concentrations in 3, and by greater than 3 concentrations in none. From th e total of 50 subjects, a new relationship was 124developed: Log10 (APC10) = 0.68 log10 (HPC20 X SS) (r from which 46 of 50 (92%) of allergen PC20 values fall within 2 doubling concentrations of the regressi on line (and all within 3). Early airway responsiveness to a given allergen ca n be predicted within a +/- 8-fold range, which is better than some investigator 's test reproducibility of +/- 1 log (10-fold). Allergen inhalation tests to determine early asthmatic responsiveness to different IgE-mediated allergens can probably be replaced by the simpler and safer determinatio ns of allergen sensitivity (SS, RAST) and histamine or methacholine airway Deschesnes PM, Watson betw een allergen skin test sensit ivity, airway responsiveness and airway response to allergen.

We compared the measured allergen PC20 to that predicted from the previous histamine PC20-based endpoint (r=0.52, P <0.00005). The relationship was improved by log-allergen allergen PC20 to within 2 doubling concentrations in 80% and within 3 in 92%. The new methacholine-based formula to within 2 and 3 concentrations in 81% and 94%, respectively; only nine of 158 subjects were outside the 3 concentrations. CONCLUSION S: We have confirmed the dependence of the allergen-induced early asthmatic response upon the le vel of allergic sensitivity and the degree of AHR, the latter as assessed by methacholine chal lenge. The allergen PC20 can be predicted to within 3 doubling concentr ations in 94% of Dolovich J. Factors in allergen induced asthma: Relevance of the intensity of the reactionand non-specific bronchial reactivity. Clin Allergy 1976; 6:219-225. Early asthmatic ) of similar severity were produced by allergen inhalation challenges in nine asthmatic subj ects. The severity of the airway s allergic reaction was estimated by measuring the skin test weal size produced by the same dilution of allergen which caused the EAR. The non-specific bronchial reactivity was assessed by inhalati on of incresing concentrations of histamine acid phosphate. Possible relationships between the severtiy of the airways allergic reaction, the level of non-specific bronchial hyper-reactivity and the pattern of asthmatic response 125were examined. There was a marked inverse co rrelation between the required severity of the airways allergic reaction and the non-specific bronchial reactivity (log10) of the individual (r = -0- 96, P less than 0-001). The EAR was followed by a late asthmatic response (LAR) in five subjects. There was no evident correlation between the magn itude of the EAR and that of the LAR. In addition, no correlation was obtained between the pattern of respons e interms of EAR or LAR and the severity of the allergic r eaction, or the level of non-specific bronchial reactivity. These results indicate that the al lergic reaction and the non-specific bronchi al reactivity are in terrelated in the production of allergen-induced asthma. Thus a mild allergic reaction will induce and EAR in patients with markedly increased non-specific br onchial reactivity, wherea s a severe allergic reaction is required to produce an EAR in thos e with only slightly increased non-specific reactivity. The lack of correlation between the oc currence of the LAR and the intensity of the airways allergic reaction, the non-specific bronchial reactivity and the in tensity of the EAR indicates that other factors are i nvolved in the development of LAR. c.

J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2010 Oct;126(4):784-90. Epub 2010 Aug 14. BACKGROUND: Cutan prostaglandin (PG) D levels increase after scratching. Chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on receptor on T(H)2 cells (CRTH2) mediates chemotaxis to PGD and is expressed on T(H)2 cells and eosinophils, which infiltrate skin lesions in patients with atopic dermatitis. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the role of a murine model of atopic dermatitis control animals epicutaneously sensitized by means of repeated application of ovalbumin (OVA) to tape-stripped skin for 7 weeks and th en challenged by means of OVA application to tape-stripped previously unsensitized skin for 1 week. Skin histology was assessed by means of hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohist ochemistry. Cytokine of ive RT-PCR. Levels of PGD , antibody, and cytokines were measured by means of ELISA. RESULTS: PGD levels significantly increased in skin 24 hours after tape stripping, although not in skin subjected to repeated sensitization with OVA. Allergic skin inflammation developed normally at sites of chronic epicutaneous sensitization with OVA in CRTH2(-/-) mice but was severely impaired in previ ously unsensitized skin challenged with OVA, as evidenced by significantly decreased skin in filtration with eosinophils and CD4(+) cells and impaired T(H)2 cytokine mRNA expression. Impa ired skin inflammation at sites of acute OVA challenge in CRTH2(-/-) mice was not due to an impaired systemic response to epicutaneous sensitization because OVA-specific IgG1 and IgE antibody levels splenocyte secretion of cytokines in these mi ce were comparable with those seen in wild-type control animals. CONCLUSIONS: CRTH2 promotes allergic skin in flammation in response to cutaneous exposure to antigen in previously sensitized mice.

IL-17 has been implicated in a number of inflam matory diseases, but the conditions of antigen exposure that drive the generation of Th17 responses have not been well defined. Epicutaneous (EC) immunization of mice with ovalbumin (OVA), which causes allergic skin inflammation with many characteristics of the skin lesions of atopic dermatitis, was found to also drive IL-17 expression in the skin. EC, but not i.p., immunization of mice with OVA drove the generation of IL-17-producing T cells in drai ning lymph nodes and spleen and increased serum IL-17 levels. OVA inhalation by EC-sensitized mice induced IL-17 and CXCL2 expression and neutrophil influx in the lung along with bronchial hyperreactiv ity, which were reversed by IL-17 blockade. Dendritic cells trafficking from skin to lymph nodes expressed more IL-2 3 and induced more IL- 17 secretion by na\u00efve T cells than splenic dendritic cells. This wa s inhibited by neutralizing IL-23 vitro and by intradermal inj ection of anti-TGFbeta neutralizing antibody in vivo. Our findings suggest that initial cutaneous exposure to antig ens in patients with atopic dermatitis may selectively induce the production of IL-17, which, in turn, drives inflammation of their airways. REVIEW: Simons FE , Johnston L, Gu X , Simons KJ. Suppression of the early and late cutaneous allergic responses us ing fexofenadine and montelukas t. Ann Allergy Asthma Imm unol. 2001 Jan;86(1):44-50 BACKGROUND: The relative contribution of histamine and the cysteinyl leukotrienes to the early and late cutaneous allergic responses (ECAR and LCAR) can be studied using antagonists of these mediators. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rela tive suppression of the ECARs and LCARs using an H1-receptor antagonist, a cyst einyl leukotriene1-receptor antagonist, and the two antagonists administered concurrently. out a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fou r-way crossover study in Intradermal tests with standardi zed allergen, and with histamine phosphate, LTD4, and saline controls were performe d on 5 different test days as follows: pretreatment baseline and at steady state immediately after the seventh and last dose of a 1-week course of treatment with once- daily fexofenadine, 10 mg; fexofenadine and montelukast administered concurrently; or placebo. On each test day, the skin test results were read at intervals from 0.25 to 24 hours after the intradermal injections were performed. RESULTS: After allergen injection, compared with baseline, all treatment regime ns significantly decrease d the ECAR and LCAR. After allergen injection, compar ed with placebo, fexofenadine significantly decreased the ECAR and the LCAR from 0.25 to 2 hours and at 8 hours . Montelukast did not si gnificantly decrease the ECAR or LCAR. Fexofenadine and montelukast administered concurrently were not more effective than fexofenadine alone at any time. In the control skin tests, compared with placebo, fexofenadine, but not montelukast, significantly decreased the histamine-induced response, and montelukast, but not fexofenadine, significantly response. CONCLUSIONS: Fexofenadine and montelukast admini stered concurrently we re not significantly more effective than fexofenadine alone in decreasing the ECAR and LCAR. Montelukast does not need to be discontinued before allergen skin tes ting. Further studies of the effect of concurrent treatment with higher do ses of a histamine antagonist and a leukotriene modifier on the allergic response in the skin are needed. 127 5. Role of Structural Cells: a. Epithelium: REVIEW: Takizawa H. Bronchial epithelial cells in reactions. Curr Drug Targets Inflamm Allergy. 2005 Jun;4(3):305-11. Bronchial epithelial cell s (BEC) are known to play an integr al role in the airway defense mechanism via mucociliary system as well as mech anical barriers. Recent studies further indicate that BEC produce and release biologically active compounds includ ing lipid mediators, growth factors, endothelin and a variety of cytokines/chemokines important in the pathogenesis of airway disorders. Cytokines and and release these cytokines/chemokines. BEC from patients with bronchial asthma showed increased levels of mRNA for these potent inflammatory peptides. BEC also interact with immune and inflammatory cells by direct adhesion as well as by humoral factors including cytokines. For example, eosinophil adhe sion to BEC may be an important signal for the activation and degranulation of eo sinophils. BEC is also believed to take part in the airway mucosal immunity via Toll-like rece ptors. Finally, BEC may play a cr ucial role in the processes of airway remodeling by cross-talk with mesenchymal cells. These findings st rongly suggest that BEC are actively involved as regulators of allerg ic inflammatory responses, and become a target for therapeutic intervention.

Cell Immunol. 2010;264(1):32-41. Epub 2010 May 5. IL-5 is a pleiotropic promotes eosinophil differentiation a nd survival. While na\u00efve bronchial epithelial cells (BEC) produce low levels of IL-5, the role of BEC-derived IL-5 in allergic airway inflammation is unknown. We now show that BEC, isolated from mice with OVA- induced allergic airway disease (AAD), produced elevated levels of IL-5 mRNA and protein as compared to BEC from na\u00efve mice. To determine th e contribution of BEC-derived IL-5 to effector responses in the airways, IL-5 deficient bone marrow chimeric mice were generated in which IL-5 expression was restricted to st romal (e.g. BEC) or hematopoietic cells. When subjected to AAD, IL-5 produced by BECs contributed to mucous metaplasia, airway eosinophilia, and OVA-specific IgA levels. Thus, IL-5 production by BEC can impact the microenvironment of the lung, modifying pathologic and protective immune responses in the airways. KEY INVESTIGATION: Erez Salik, Max Tyorkin, Savita Mohan et al. Antigen Trafficking and Accessory Cell Func tion in Respiratory Epithelial Cells Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999;21: 365-379 We investigated accessory cel l function, antigen (Ag) trafficking, and uptake of immune complexes in isolated nasal epithelial cells (NEC) and airway epithelial cells (AEC), as well as in 128the two respiratory epith elial cell lines A 549 and BEAS-2B. The NEC and AEC were capable of supporting Ag-specific as well as phytohemagglu tinin-induced and anti-CD 3 antibody-induced cell proliferation. W colocalized fluorescein is othiocyanate (FITC)-labeled Ags with human A549 and BEAS-2B, utilizing laser confocal microscopy. Respiratory epithelial cells stimulated and unst imulated with interferon (IFN)- were pulsed with FITC-labeled Ags for varying periods and evaluate d for their ability to internalize Ag. In the unstimulated cells, intracellular punctate staining was evident at 60 min and persisted up to 120 min. In the IFN stimulated cells (100 U/ml for 48 h), uptake occurred at 30 min, was maximal at 60 min, and diminished at 120 min. We conducted ki netic studies in the A549 and BEAS-2B cells, utilizing electron microscopy w ith colloidal gold-conjugated Ags (Au-OVA). At 15 min, Au-OVA was evident in the early compartments resembli ng the compartment of uncoupling of receptor and ligand. At 30 min, multivesicula r bodies were labeled with Au-OVA, and by 60 min Au-OVA was present in the primary and secondary lysosomes. The FITC-labeled Ags colocalized with an early endosomal marker (anti-cathepsin D), a late endosomal marker (M6PR), a lysosomal marker and of acidic vesicles. The BEAS-2B and A549 cells, and NEC and AEC, expressed surface Fc recep tor and internalized IgG immune complexes. The NEC and AEC also expressed the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 as determined with flow cytometry, th e reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for RNA, and immunohistochemist ry, and T-cell proliferation c ould be blocked by treating NEC andAEC with anti-CD80 and anti-CD86 antibodies.

Evidence for Stem-Cell Niches in Tracheal Epithelium Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol., 2001;24:662-670 It is generally important to elucidate airway epithelial cell lineages and to identify multipotent progenitors as targets for gene therapy. Stem (S) cells are ty pically present in specialized compartments spatially proximal to their differe ntiated progeny, but an equivalent paradigm has not been demonstrated in the ai rway. We discovered a distinct popul ation of cells displaying high levels of keratin expression in murine tracheal submucosal gland ducts, and hypothesis that bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labe l-retaining cells (LRCs), thought to represent the S-cells, were present in this compartment. Mi ce received weekly epithelial damage by intratracheal detergent or SO2 inhalation for 4 wk and rece ived intraperitoneal injections of BrdU every 48 h during the injury and repair period. At 3 a nd 6 d after injury, BrdU-positive epithelial cells were noted along the entire tracheal length in bot h basal and lumenal cell positions. At later time points (20 and 95 d) LRCs were localized to gland ducts in the upp er trachea and to systematically arrayed foci in the lower trachea, typically near the cartilage-intercartilage LRCs were not pulmonary neuroendocrine cells. Heterotopic tracheal grafts surface epithelial removal demonstrated reconstitution of a surface-like epithelium from gl and remnants. These results suggest that airway epithelial S cells are localized to specific niches. b. Endothelium: REVIEW: Tabuchi A, Kuebler WM. 129Vascul Pharmacol. 2008 Oct-Dec;49(4-6):141-50. Epub 2008 Jun 24. In addition to their established role in hemostas is, recent studies have identified platelets as key regulators of inflammatory reactions. Upon activati on, platelets interact with both endothelial cells and circulating leukocytes. By receptor-mediated ac tivation of interacting cell types and by release of mitogenic, pro-inflammatory and -coagulatory mediators, platelets cont ribute crucially to the initiation and propagation of pat hological conditions and processe s such as inflammatory bowel disease or atherosclerosis. In inflammatory lung disease, platelets play a critical role in the recruitment of neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocyt es as shown in experimental models of acute lung injury and allergic airway inflammation. Circulati ng platelet-leukocyte a ggregates have been detected in patients with allergic asthma and cys tic fibrosis, and in experimental lung injury. Here, we discuss the molecular mechanisms regulating the interaction of plat elets with leukocytes, endothelial cells, and the subendot helial with special regard to platelet kinetics in pulmonary microvessels and the putative role of plat elets in inflammatory lung disorders. In light of the existing data from experimental and clinical studies it is conceivabl e that platelet adhesion molecules and platelet mediator s provide promising targets for novel therapeutic strategies in inflammatory lung diseases. KEY INVESTIGATION: Shasby DM, Shasby SS, Sullivan JM, Peach Increased permeability of the pulmonary ulature is felt to cause acute noncardiogenic lung edema, and histological studies of edematous lungs show gaps between apparently healthy endothelial cells. To determine whether alteratio ns in endothelial cell cy toskeletons would alter endothelial permeability, we exposed monolayers of pulmonary artery endothelial cells grown on micropore filters to cytochalasin B or D. Cytochal asin exposed monolayers demonstrated a 2- to 3- fold increase in endothelial permeability that was readily reversible by washing the monolayers freeof cytochalasins. Parallel phase contrast a nd fluorescence microscopy demonstrated retraction of cell cytoplasm and disruption of bundles of mi crofilaments in cytochalasin exposed cells. These changes also were readily reversed after washing the cells free from cytochalasins. To test the relevance of these findings to an in situ microvasc ulature, we added cytochalasin B to the perfusate of isolated rabbit lungs and observed that cyto chalasin B caused a high permeability lung edema.

Effect of Antigen Exposure on Airway Smooth Muscle Remodeling in an Equine Model of Chronic Asthma. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2010 Oct 8. [Epub ahead of print] Rationale: Recent studies suggest that airway sm ooth muscle remodeling is an early event in asthma but it is unknown whether it remains a dynamic process late in the course of the disease. Little is known of the effect of an antigenic exposure on chro nically established smooth muscle remodeling. Objectives: To measure the effect of antigen exposure on airway smooth muscle in central and peripheral airw ays of horses with heaves, a natura lly occurring airway disease that 130shares similarities with chronic asthma. Methods: Heaves-affected horses (6) and age-matched controls (5) were kept on past ure before being exposed to indoor antigens for 30 days to induce airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction. Peri pheral lung and endobronchial biopsies were collected before and after antigen exposure by thoracoscopy and bronchoscopy, respectively. Immunohistochemistry and enzymatic labeling were used for morphometric analysis of airway smooth muscle mass and proliferative and apoptotic myocytes. Measurements and Main Results: In peripheral airways, heaves-affected horses had twice as much smooth muscle as controls. Remodeling was associated with smooth muscle hyperplasia and in situ proliferation without reduced apoptosis. Further antigen exposure ha d no effect on morphometric data. In central airways, proliferating myocytes were increased compared to cont rols only after antigen exposure. Conclusions: Peripheral airway smooth muscle mass is stable in chronically affected animals subjected to antigenic exposure. This increased mass is maintained in a dynamic equilibrium by an elevated cellular turnover, suggest ing that targeting smooth muscle proliferation could be effective at decreasing ch ronic remodeling. AT A GLANCE COMMENTARY: Scientific Knowledge on the Subject: Recent studies suggest that airway smooth muscle remodeling is an early event in asthma but it is unknown whether it remains a dynamic process late in the course of the disease and how antigen exposure affects established remodeling. What This Study Adds to the Field: We showed that a 30-day antigen exposure had little effect on established remodeling in diseased animals, despite the development of inflammation and bronchoconstriction. In peripheral airways, airway smooth muscle remodeling appears to be maintained in a dynamic equilibrium by an elevated turnover with in situ proliferation, suggesting that targetin g airway smooth muscle proliferation could be effective at decreasing its mass. REVIEW: James A and N Carroll Airway smooth muscle in health and disease; methods of measurement and relation to function Eur Respir J 2000;15:782-789 Smooth muscle is present and proba bly functional in the airways in utero and increases in absolute area during growth with little furt her change during adulthood. It en circles the entire airway below the level of the main bronchus, in a roughly circular orientation, except at high lung volumes. It occupies relatively more of the airway wall in the peripheral airways, re aching a maximum in the membranous bronchioles. Measurement of smooth mu scle area in the airway wall is confounded by clinical classification of cas es, methods of tissue retrieval and preparation, staining and orientation of sections, magnification, image an alysis and statistical methods of comparison between groups. Airway smooth muscle area is pathologically increased in inflammatory conditions of the airways such as chronic obstruc tive pulmonary disease, in relation to airways obstruction, and asthma, in relati on to severity and airway size (between 25 and 250% compared with control cases). It is increas ed in sudden infant death syndro me, but there are few studies in 131other conditions such as bronchiec tasis. In asthma, sm ooth muscle must shorten (not necessarily to an abnormal degree) for the structural abnormalities of the airway to manifest as excessive airway narrowing. Not surprisingly there is renewed interest in the relati onships between the mechanical and contractile properties of smooth muscle, parenchymal properties and lung volume and how these interact to determine smooth muscle length. The relative importance of smooth muscle area and mechanical properties, altered airway structur e and airway inflammation in disease are yet to be determined. RESEARCH FRONTIER: SJ Hirst, TR Walker, and ER Chilvers Phenotypic diversity and molecular mechanisms of airway smooth muscle proliferation in asthma Eur Respir J 2000;16:159-177 Chronic persistent asthma is characterized by poorly reversible airflo w obstruction and airways inflammation and remodelling. Histopathological st udies of airways removed at post mortem from patients with severe asthma reveal marked inflammatory and architectural changes associated with airway wall thickening. Increased airway smoot h muscle content, occu rring as a result of hyperplastic and/or hypertrophic gr owth, is believed to be one of the principal contributors to airway wall thickening. In recent years, significant advances have been made in elucidating the mediators and the intracellular pathways that re gulate proliferation of ai rway smooth muscle. The contribution that smooth muscle makes to pers istent airflow obstruction may not, however, be limited simply to its increased bulk within the airw ay wall. Interest is growing in the possibility that reversible phenotypic modulation and incr eased heterogeneity of airway smooth muscle function may also be a feature of the asthmatic airway. This review focuses on possible mechanisms controlling smooth musc le phenotype heterogeneity as well as on the mediators and intracellular pathways implicated in its cellular prolif eration. Particular attention is paid to mechanisms involving activation of the extracellula r signal regulated kinase-, protein kinase C- and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent pathways, si nce these appear to be the major candidate second messenger pathways for G protein- and tyrosine H\u00f6hne K, Luttmann W, Krause S, Virchow JC Jr, Friedrich K. Interleukin-13 acts as an apoptotic effector on lung epithelial cells and induces pro-fibrotic gene expressi on in lung fibroblastsClin Exp Allergy. 2008 Apr;38(4):619-28. Epub 2008 Feb 11. BACKGROUND: IL-13 promotes acute allergic asthma and is discussed to play a role in late asthmatic features such as fibrotic processes a nd airway remodelling. The contributions of IL-13- mediated mechanisms to subepith elial events related to fibrosis are not yet settled. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the impact of IL-13 on lung epithelial cells as apoptotic effector and on lung fibroblasts as inducer of pro-fibrotic ge ne expression. METHODS: Using the two lung epithelial cell lines A549 and BEAS-2B as well as primar y lung epithelial cells, we investigated the capability of IL-13 to induce apoptosis by both flow-cytometry and ELISA. The ability of IL-13 to increase the expression of pro-fi brotic genes and to exert influe nce on the expression of its own receptor was investigated by real-time quant itative PCR measurement of mRNAs encoding 132collagen I, collagen III, fi broblast growth factor (bFGF), alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha- SMA) IL-13 receptor pha1 (IL-13Ralpha1) chain in huma n primary lung fibroblasts. The specificity of IL-13-mediated cellular responses was confirme d by means of an inhibitory monoclonal antibody directed to the IL-13 receptor. RESULTS: IL-13 induces apoptosis in lung epithelial cell lines as well as in primary lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, IL-13 increases the expression of mRNA for alpha-SMA and collagen III, but not for bFGF in human primary lung fibroblasts. The susceptibility of lung fibroblasts to IL-13-induced up-regulation of pro-fibrotic genes is associated with the regulation of IL -13 receptor expression. IL-13-dependent fibrosis- associated effects could be inhi bited by antibody-mediated blockade of the IL-13Ralpha1 subunit. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate a function of IL-13 as a mediator in fibrotic processes leading to loss of functional airway tissue in asth ma. They also highlight the therapeutic potential of specifically targeting the interac tion between IL-13 and its receptor. REVIEW: Levine SJ Bronchial epithelial cell-cytokine interactions in airway inflammation J Investig Med. 1995;43:241-9 A variety of cytokine bronchial cell interactions may play an importa nt role in normal host defense as well as in the pathogenesis of inflammatory ai rway disorders such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, acute and chronic bronchitis, and bronchiectasis. Fi rst, airway epithelial cells may participate in local cytokine networks by synt hesizing interleukins, chemokines, colony stimulating factors and growth factors in response to inflammatory mediat ors. Bronchial epithelial cell derived cytokines may thereby amplify ongoing inflammatory pro cesses via the recruitment and activation of specific subsets of inflammatory cells, as well as by prolonging their su rvival in the airway microenvironment. Second, airway epithelial cells can initiate inflammatory cascades by generating cytokines in direct response to viral and bacteria l products, noxious gases, and sensitizing chemicals. Third, airway epithelia l cells represent targets for paracrine acting cytokines, which may then modulate bronchial epith elial cell functions. Fi nally, airway epithelial cells may modulate ongoing inflammatory events in the airway microenvir onment via the shedding of soluble TNF receptors. Cytokine-bronchial epithelial cell interactions represent an important mechanism by which inflammatory events in the airway microenvironment can be regulated and represent potential ta rgets for novel anti-inflammatory th erapies in airway disorders. Susceptibility Human to Rhinovirus Infection. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2010 Jan 15. [Epub ahead of print] Infection of airway ep ithelium by rhinovirus is the commonest cause of asthma exacerbations. Even in mild asthma, airway epithelium shows mucous metaplasia, and this increases with increasing severity of disease. We have earlier shown that squamous cu ltures of human airway epithelium have many times higher levels of rhinoviral infection than are well-differentiated cultures of mucociliary phenotype. Here we have te sted the hypothesis that mucous metaplasia is also associated with increased le vels of rhinoviral infection. Muc ous metaplasia was induced with IL-13, which doubled the numbers of goblet cells. In both control (mucocilia ry) and IL-13- treated 133(mucous me were preferentially infected by rhinovirus. IL-13 doubled the numbers of infected cells by increa sing the numbers of infected goblet cells. Furthermore, IL-13 also increased both the maturi ty of the goblet cells and the probability that a goblet cell would be infected. Infect ion of cells that were not goblet cells were unaltered by IL-13. IL-13 treatment did not alter the levels of rhinovirus receptor IC AM-1, nor did the proliferative effects of IL-13 enhance infecti on, as rhinovirus did not colocalize with dividing cells. However, induction of mucous metaplasia caused changes in the apical membrane structure, notably a marked decrease in overall ciliation and an increase in the overall flatness of the apical surface. We conclude that the presence of mucous metaplas ia in asthma increases the susceptibility of airway epithelium to infection by rh inovirus due to changes in the ove rall architecture of the apical J, J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol., Volume 21, Number 3, September 1999 365-379 Severe impairment of mucociliary clearance (MC) in hospitalized asthmatics has recently been demonstrated in peripheral and central airways. MC was also shown to improve with clinical recovery and hospital disc harge (2). In the present study, we meas ure MC in chronic, stable asthma in subjects with a wide range of obstruction to see if MC was rela ted to the severity of chronic disease. We separated the subjec ts into those with severe obs truction with expiratory flow limitation during tidal breathing (FL subjects) an d those without tidal flow limitation (NFL subjects) to see if the presen ce of chronic flow limitation wa s associated with regional MC abnormalities. Seventeen asthmatic patients were studied. Mucociliary clearance was assessed using inhaled radioaerosol and seri al measurements of the retenti on of radioactivity over 2 h. By controlling breathing pattern, the in itial pattern of deposition in th e lungs was matched, with all subjects having a predominance of particles in the central airways. This pattern was normalized for regional lung volume using a xenon equilibrium s can and expressed as a specific central to peripheral (sC/P) ratio. The percen tage retention of deposited radioactivity at 120 min ranged from 19 to 83% (mean, 52%). FL subjects had a mean re tention at 120 min of 66% (range, 55 to 83%). The NFL subjects had a mean retention at 120 mi n of 33% (range, 19 to 51%). Throughout the 2-h study period, retention by the FL group was significantly greater than that of the NFL group with separation of 95% c onfidence intervals. C.

The physiologic basis of spirometry. Hayes D Jr, Kraman SS. Department of Pediatrics, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington KY Spirometry is the most useful and commonly av ailable tests of pulmonary function. It is a physiological test that measures individual inhalation and exhalati on volumes of air as a function of time. Pulmonologists and genera l-practice physicians commonly us e spirometry in their offices in the assessment and management of lung dis ease. Spirometric indices are well validated and easily interpreted by comparison with establishe d normal values. The remarkable reproducibility of spirometry results from the presence of comp liant intrathoracic airways that act as air flow regulators during forced expiration. Because of this anatomic arrangement, expiratory flow becomes dependent solely on the elasticity of the l ungs and airway resistance once a certain degree of expiratory force is exerted. Insight into this aspect of resistance once a certain degress of expiratory force is exerted. Insight into this aspeci of respiratory phys iology can help in the interpretation of spirometry.

Division of Pulmonary, Aller gy, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pe nnsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. Spirometry is a useful test of pulmonary functi on and can be safely performed in a variety of clinical situations. Al though the technique for performing the maneuver is straightforward, there are many sources of variability in re sults. Specific criteria must be met in order for the test to be considered valid. For the best results, proper in struction and coaching is essential, and patient understanding and effort must be maximized. Appr opriate interpretation of spirometry requires several steps, including recognition and reporting of technically sound maneuvers, comparison to an appropriate reference population, and finally application of a well-de veloped interpretation scheme utilized in the context of patient sympto ms and findings. Failure at any point along this path from performance to interpretation can yi eld misleading results that may ultimately poorly impact patient care.

Provocative challenges (exercise, methac holine, allergen, other): indications, performance, and interpretation, predictive asthma REVIEW: Curr Opin Pulm Med. 2008 Jan;14(1):39-45. Anderson SD. Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Camperdown, New South Wales, Australia. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review bronchial provocations tests used in the measurement of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to help in the diagnosis of asthma. RECENT FINDINGS: The bronchial provocations tests revi ewed include exercise, methacholine, AMP and mannitol, with reference to methodology and monitoring of treat ment. SUMMARY: Methacholine is used for identifying bronchial hyperresponsiveness and to gui de treatment. Exercise is used as a bronchial provocation test because demonstrating prevention of exercise-induced asthma is an indication for use of a drug. Both of these tests are being used to study tolerance to be ta2 agonists. There is increasing use of eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea as a surrogate bronchial provocation test for exercise to identify exercise-induced asthma, par ticularly in athletes. For methacholine and AMP there is concern about the different breathing patterns used to inhale these aerosols and the impact they have on the cutoff point for identifying bronchial hyperresponsiveness. A new test that uses a kit containing prepacked capsules of different doses of mannitol and a delive ry device is discussed. There is increasing interest in using tests that act indirectly by release of mediators because the bronchial hyperresponsiveness itself is an indicator of the presence of inflammation. Since treatment of inflammation leads to loss of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to i ndirect stimuli, these tests are well suited to identify success of treatment.

Pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of drugs used Am. 2005;25:469-88. A comparison of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of inhaled corticosteroids is necessary for their assessment. A good knowledge of these two aspects allows the optimization of efficacy and safety. The currently available inhaled corticosteroids already show some of the desired PK/PD parameters. The local adverse ef fects are decreased as soon as the inhaled corticosteroid is administered as an inactive prodrug or shows a lung deposition. HFA-MDI beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP ) and ciclesonide are two agents that illustrate this. Low oral bioavailability, rapid systemic clearance, and high plasma protein binding can minimize systemic adverse effects. Mometasone furoate, cicles onide, and fluticasone propionate possess those characteristics. The pulmonary efficacy is ma ximized by high lung deposition and long pulmonary residence times. This effect can be achieved by slow dissolution in the lu ngs, as is the case for fluticasone propionate or lipid conjugation and has been shown for budesonide and ciclesonide. Furthermore, the lung deposition depends on the i nhalation device, the particle size, and the inhalation technique. Theref ore, improvement in the design of MDIs, DPIs, and nebulizers, and the development of more effective dr ug particles will lead to an op timized pulmonary targeting. Much progress has been made in the treatment of asth ma. The available inhaled corticosteroids show a high safety profile and a good pulmonary selectivity. Development of newer compounds showed that improvement is possible as the result of a complete understanding of the PK/PD concepts. However, the introduction of further improved fo rmulations with a bette r efficacy/safety profile will be difficult and protracted because the existing drugs are already highly efficient. KEY INVESTIGATION: Schuh, et al. A comparison of inhaled fluticasone and oral prednisone for children with severe acute asthma. N Engl J Med 2000;343:689-94 BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids are effective in the treatmen t of children with asthma. It is uncertain how inhaled corticosteroids compare w ith oral corticosteroids in the management of severe acute disease. METHOD S: We performed a double-blind, randomized trial involving 100 children five years of age or older who had severe acute asthma (indicated by a forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] that was less than 60 percent of the predicted value) and in whom the results could be evaluated. All were treated with an aggr essive bronchodilator regimen and received one dose of either 2 mg of inhaled fluticasone through a mete red-dose inhaler with a spacer or 2 mg of oral prednisone per kilogram of body weight. They were assessed hourly for up to four hours. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) base-lin e FEV1 as a percentage of the predicted value 137was 46.3+/-12.5 in the fluticasone group (51 subject s) and 43.9+/-9.9 in th e prednisone group (49 subjects). The FEV1 increased by a m ean of 9.4+/ -12.5 percentage points in the fluticasone group and by 18.9+/-9.8 percentage points in the predni sone group four hours after therapy (P< 0.001). None of the children in the pr ednisone group had a reduction in FEV1 as a percentage of the predicted value from base line to four hours, as compared with 25 pe rcent of those in the fluticasone group (P<0.001). Sixteen (31 percent) of the children treated with fluticasone were hospitalized, as compared with five (10 percen t) of those treated w ith prednisone (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Children with severe acute asthma should be treated with oral prednisone and not with inhaled fluticasone or a similar inhaled corticosteroid. KEY INVESTIGATION -GROWTH: Agertoft and Pedersen. Effect of long-term treatment with inhaled budesonide on adult height in children with asthma. N Engl J Med 2000;343:1064-9 BACKGROUND: Short-term studies have shown that inhaled corticosteroids may reduce the growth of children with asthma. However, the effect of long-term treatme nt on adult height is uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in children with asthma to examine the effect of long-term treatment with inhaled bude sonide on adult height. We report on 211 children who have attained adult height: 142 budesonide-tre ated children with asth ma, 18 control patients with asthma who have never received inhaled corticosteroids, and 51 healthy siblings of patients in the budesonide group, who also served as contro ls. RESULTS: The children in the budesonide group attained adult height after a mean of 9.2 y ears of budesonide treatment (range, 3 to 13) at a mean daily dose of 412 microg (range, 110 to 877). The mean cumulative dose of budesonide was 1.35 g (range, 0.41 to 3.99). The mean differences between the measured and target adult heights were +0.3 cm (95 percent confidence interval, -0 .6 to + 1.2) for the budesonide-treated children, - 0.2 cm (95 percent confidence interv al, -2.4 to +2.1) for the control children with asthma, and +0.9 cm (95 percent confidence interval, -0.4 to +2.2) for the healthy siblings. The adult height depended significantly (P<0.001) on the child's he ight before budesonide treatment. Although growth rates were significantly reduced during the firs t years of budesonide treatment, these changes in growth rate were not significantly associated with adu lt height. CONCLUSIONS: Children with asthma who have received long-term treatment with budesonide attain normal adult height. REVIEW GROWTH: Allen DB. Inhaled steroids for children: effects on growth, bone, and adrenal function. Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am.. 2005;34:555-64. Inhaled corticosteroids are the first-line therapy for persistent asthma in children. Major safety concerns of long-term inhaled co rticosteroid therapy include suppression of adrenal function and impaired growth and bone development. Proper in terpretation of inhaled corticosteroid safety requires knowledge of differences among various dr ug devices. Dosage, type of inhaler device used, patient technique, and characteristics of th e individual drug influenc e systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids. Systemic side effects can occur when continuous high-dose treatment is required for severe asthma or when prescribed dosage is excessive and compliance is unusually good. Recent studies confirm that benefits of inhaled corticosteroids outweigh potential adverse effects and the risks associated with poorly controlled asthma. 138 KEY INVESTIGATION OSTEOPO ROSIS: Johannes CB et al. The Risk of Nonvertebral Fracture Related to Inhaled Corticosteroid Exposure Among Adults With Chronic Respiratory Disease Chest 2005 ; 127: 89 - 97. OBJECTIVE: To examine nonvertebra l fracture risk in relation to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) exposure among adults with respiratory disease. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Nested case-control study within a cohort of 89,877 UnitedHealthcare members aged 40 years with physician insurance claims for COPD or asthma, enrolled for 1 year from January 1, 1997 to June 30, 2001. METHODS: Cases (n = 1,722) repr esented patients with a first treated nonvertebral fracture (the index date is the first fracture claim). Control subjects (n = 17,220) were randomly selected from the person-time and assigned a random index date. ICS exposure was ascertained 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months before the index date, with estimat ed cumulative dose through 0 to 6 months, 7 to 12 months, and 0 to 12 months. Covariates included demographics, oral corticosteroid and other medication exposure, comorbidities, and indicato rs of respiratory disease severity. Odds ratios (ORs) adjusted fo r all covariates were estimated by logistic regression. Results: No increased fracture risk with ICS exposure as a class or with flutic asone propionate alone was detected. ORs for exposure in the preceding 30 days were 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 1.24), 1.13 (95% and 0.97 to 1.21) for all ICS, fluticasone propionate, and other ICS, respectively. No dose-response effect was present. Among patients with COPD only (n = 6,932), no increased risk was found for recent ICS exposure (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.25). CONCLUSIONS: Con cern about nonvertebral fracture risk should not strongly influence the decisi on to use recommended doses of ICS for adult patients with asthma or COPD in managed-care settings in the United States. This study could not evaluate very-high ICS dose, long-term ICS exposure, or vertebral fracture risk.

Osteoporos Int 2003;14,179-190 Deleterious effect of oral cor ticosteroids on bone has been well documented, whereas this remains debated for inhaled ones (ICS). Our objectives were to analyze the effects of ICS on bone mineral density, fracture risk and bone markers. We performed an exhaustive systematic research of all controlled trials potentially containing pertinen t data, peer-reviewed by a dedicated WHO expert group, and comprehensive meta-analyses of the data. Inclusion criteria were ICS, and BMD/markers/fractures in asthma/chronic obstruc tive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and healthy patients. Analyses were performed in a cons ervative fashion using professional dedicated softwares and stratified by outcome, study desi gn and ICS type. Results were expressed as standardized mean difference/eff ect size (ES), relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR), depending on study design and outcome units. Publication bias was investigated. Twenty-three trials were reviewed; 11 papers fit the inclusion criteria a nd were assessed for the main analysis. Quality scores for the randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) were 80%, 71% for the prospective cohort studies, 78% for the retrospec tive cohort and cross-s ectional studies. We globally assessed ICS effects on BMD and found deleterious effects: ES=0.61 ( and 139ES=0.27 ( p<0.001) for asthma/COPD patients. For th ese patients, this effect was 0.21 ( p<0.01) at the lum bar spine, and 0.26 ( p<0.001) at the hi p or femoral neck. A single study evaluated the impact of ICS on hip fracture and reported an increased OR of 1.6 (1.24; 2.03). Lumbar fracture rate differences did not reach the level of stat istical significance: 1.87 (0.5; 6.94). ICTP, pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline levels we re not significantly affected. Budesonide (BUD) appeared to be th e ICS inducing the less de leterious effects on bone, followed by beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and triamcinolone (TR I). Publication bias investigation provided non-signifi cant results. In our meta-analy ses, BUD at a mean daily dose (SD) of 686 &mgr;g (158 &mgr;g), BDP at 703 &mgr;g (123 &mgr;g) and TRI at 1000 &mgr;g (282 &mgr;g) were found to affect bone mineral de nsity and markers in patients suffering from the two major respiratory diseases. Th ese findings could have practical implication in the long-term management of asthmatic and COPD patients. REVIEW OSTEONECROSIS: Powell C, Chang C, Naguwa SM, Cheema G, G ershwin ME.

Most cases of osteonecrosis are secondary to systemically administered corticosteroidsgh and/or high dose daily therapy, pa rticularly in patients with underlying comorbidities including connectiv e tissue diseases, hyperlip idemia, or previous trauma. Previous case reports of osteonecrosis rela ted to inhaled or topical use of steroids are complicated by the fact that in the great major ity of cases, the patients are also treated with systemic steroids prior to the development of osteon ecrosis.

Kerachian MA, of the femoral head: a new understanding of the mechanisms of J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol 2009;114:121-8. Glucocorticoid is non-traumatic cause of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ON). Investigators have proposed both direct and i ndirect effects of GC on cells. Indirect and direct mechanisms remain intimately related and often result in positive feedback loops to potentiate the disease processes. However, the direct effects, in particular apoptosis, have recently been shown to be increasingly importa nt. Suppression of osteoblast and osteoclast precursor production, increased ap optosis of osteoblasts and os teocytes, prolongation of the lifespan of osteoclasts and apoptosis of endothelial cells (EC) are a ll direct effects of GC usage. Elevated blood pressure through several pathways may raise the risk of clot formation. High-dose GC also decreases tissue plasmi the procoagulant of GC. Inhibited angiogenesis, altered bone repair and nitric oxide metabolism can also result. Also, GC treatment modulates other vasoactive mediators such as endothelin-1, noradrenalin and bradykinin. Thus, GCs act as a regulator of local blood flow by modulating vascular responsiveness to vasoactive substances. Vasoconstriction induced in intraosse ous femoral head arteries femoral cause ischemia through increa sed intraosseous pressu re, which subsequently decreases the blood flow to the fe moral head by apoptosis of ECs as well as elevating the level of adipogenesis and fat hypertrophy in the bone marrow. It is difficult to predict which patients receiving a specific dose of GC will develop ON, indicating individual differences in steroid 140sensitivity and the potential of additional mechanisms. The textbook model of ON is a multiple hit theory in which, with a greater number of risk factors, the risk of ON increases. REVIEW STEROID MECHANISMS AND RESISTANCE: Barnes PJ. Mechanisms and resistance in glucoc orticoid control of inflammation. J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol 2010;120:76-85. Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by several mechanisms. Glucocorticoids suppress the multiple inflammatory genes that are activated in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, by reversing histone acetylation of activated inflammatory genes through binding of liganded glucocorticoid receptors (GR) to coactivator molecules and recrui tment of histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) to the activated transcription complex. At higher concentrations of glucocorticoids GR homodimers interact with DNA recognition site s to activate transcri ption through increased histone acetylation of anti-inflam matory genes and transcripti on of several genes linked to glucocorticoid side effects. Decr eased glucocorticoid responsive ness is found in patients with severe asthma and asthmatics who smoke, as well as in all patients with COPD and cystic fibrosis. Several molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance have now been identified. HDAC2 is markedly reduced in activity and expression as a result of oxidative/nitrative stress so that inflammation becomes resistant to the anti-inflamma tory actions of glucocorticoids. Dissociated glucocorticoids have been developed to reduce si de effects but so far it has been difficult to dissociate anti-inflammatory effects from advers e effects. In patients with glucocorticoid resistance alternative anti-inflammatory treatments are being investigated as well as drugs that may reverse the molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid resistance.

Clinicians have long known that a substantial proportion of pa tients treated with high-dose glucocorticoids experience a vari ety of serious side effects, including metabolic syndrome, bone loss, and mood shifts, such as depressive symptomatology, manic or hypomanic symptoms, and even suicide. Emerging literature is beginning to shed light on possible mechanisms of these effects. This paper reviews the basic biology of glucocorticoid release and molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid receptor functi on, and discusses how dysregulation of glucocorticoid action at all levels could contribute to such side effects. A framework for assessment of patients is proposed that incorporates functional, physiological, and molecular biomar kers to identify subgroups of patients at risk for depressive symptomatology a ssociated with glucocorticoid treatment, and for prevention of side effects, which in many cases can be life-threatening.

Molecular mechan isms of combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting Chest 2009;136:1095-1100. 141Use of corticosteroids (CSs) and beta(2) agonists in combination delivered either separately or through one device has provided some clear and important clinical adva ntages. Beta(2)-Agonists can stimulate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and promote its translocation to the nucleus, resulting in increased CS-media ted gene transcription. In structural airway cells, such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle, this gene transcription is associ ated with the formation of a complex between the GR and another transcrip tion factor, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-alpha. Airway smooth musc le cells from persons with asthma are deficient in C/EBP- alpha, which may explain the finding that CSs do not inhibit the proliferat ion of these cells in vitro. Whether this deficiency can explain the increased bulk of muscle in the asthmatic airway remains to be established. Beta(2)-agonists can inhib it mast cell mediator rel ease, but this response is susceptible to attenuation, a proc ess that CSs can inhibit. CSs also can increase the transcription of the beta(2)-receptor gene in the lung and th e nasal mucosa. These effects of CSs mitigate against the reduced transcription of beta(2)-recepto rs, which occurs as a consequence of long-term beta(2)-agonist administration. 2. Beta-Agonists and Antagonists KEY INVESTIGATION: Wechsler M et al. beta-Adrenergic receptor polymorphi sms and response to salmeterol Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2006 Mar 1;173(5):519-26 . RATIONALE: Several studies suggest that patients with asthma who are hom ozygous for arginine at the 16th position of the beta2-adrenergic receptor may not benefit from short-acting beta- agonists. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whethe r such genotype-specific effects occur when patients are treated with long-acting beta-agonist s and whether such effects are modified by concurrent inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use. METHODS: We compared salmeterol response in patients with asthma homozygous for arginine at (B16Arg/Arg) with those homozygous for glycine at B16 (B16Gly/Gly) in tw o separate cohorts. In the firs t, subjects were randomized to regular therapy with salmeterol while simulta neously discontinuing ICS therapy. In the second, subjects were randomized to regular therapy with salmeterol while continuing concomitant ICS. RESULTS: In both trials, B16Arg /Arg subjects did not benefit compared with B16Gly/Gly subjects after salmeterol was init iated. In the first cohort, comp ared with placebo, the addition of salmeterol was associated with a 51.4 L/min lowe r A.M. peak expiratory flow (PEF; p = 0.005) in B16Arg/Arg subjects(salmeterol, n = 12; placebo, n = 5) as compared with B16Gly/Gly subjects (salmeterol, n = 13; placebo, n = 13). In the seco nd cohort, B16Arg/Arg subjects treated with salmeterol and ICS concurrently (n = 8) had a lower A.M. PEF (36.8 L/min difference, p = 0.048) than B16Gly/Gly subjects (n = 22) treated wi th the same regimen. In addition, B16 Arg/Arg subjects in the second cohort ha d lower FEV1 (0.42 L, p = 0.003), increased symptom scores (0.2 units, p = 0.034), and increased albuterol rescue use (0.95 puffs /d, p = 0.004) compared with B16Gly/Gly subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to B16Gly/Gly patients with asthma, B16Arg/Arg patients with asthma may have an impaired therapeutic response to salmeterol in either the absence or presence of concurrent ICS us e. Investigation of alternate treatment strategies may benefit this group. REVIEW: Nelson HS. Is there a problem with relieving acute sy m ptoms of asthma and in the short-term prevention of symptoms from stimuli, such as exercise. They are ineffective when used on a regular schedule to improve asthma control. Long-acting 2-agonists, on the other hand, provide sustained bronchodilation and improve asthma control. Regular use of long-acting 2-agonists is not associated with significant tolerance to their br onchodilator action, impairment in the response to albuterol, decreased baseline pulmonary f unction, increased response to methacholine, or increased risk of adverse cardiac events. Case-contr ol studies do not suggest an increased risk for death or intensive care unit admissions with use of long-acting 2-agonists. In pr ospective studies in which there has been an increase in asthma deaths or serious asthma exacerbations, this increased risk has not been observed in subjects using inhaled corticosteroids. Where increased deaths have occurred in relation to either short- or long-acting 2-agonists, the events have not occurred equally throughout the exposed population. This suggests that these outcomes were not a direct toxic effect of the drugs and increases the po ssibility that they result ed from an interaction between relief of symptoms by 2-agonists and delay in seeking medical care. KEY INVESTIGATION: Bleecker ER, Yancey SW, Baitinger LA, et al. Salmeterol response is not affected by 2-adrenergic receptor genotype in subjects with persistent asthma J Allerg Clin Immunol 2006;118:809-816 BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that there might be an a ssociation between albuterol use and worsening asthma in patients homozygous for arginine (Arg/Arg) at codon 16 of the - receptor. However, it is not known whether similar responses occur in Arg/Arg patients receiving long-acting 2-agonists. OBJECTIVE: We sought to ev aluate the effects of variation in the 2- adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2 ) on clinical response to sa lmeterol administered with fluticasone propionate. METHODS: Subjects (n = 183) currently receiving short-acting 2- agonists were randomized to twice- daily therapy with salmeterol, 50 g, administered with fluticasone propionate, 100 g, in a single inhaler or daily ther apy with montelukast for 12 weeks, followed by a 2- to 4-day run-out period. RESULTS: There was sustai ned and significant improvement (P < .001) over baselin e in all measures of asthma control in subjects receiving salmeterol, regardless of Arg16Gly genotype. Morning peak expiratory flow in showed 89.0 subjects L/mi n for Arg/Gly subjects. Pairwise changes similar for Arg/Arg compared with Gly/Gly or Arg/Gly genotypes (estimated differences, 4.7 L/min and 3.5 L/min, respectively). Responses did not appear to be modified by haplotype pairs. During the run-out period, all subjects had predicta ble and similar decreases in measures of asthma control, with no differences between genotypes. CONCLUSION: Response to salmeterol does not vary between ADRB2 genotypes after chronic dosing with an inhaled corticosteroid. Clinical im plications: Analyses from this study indicate that genetic polymorphisms leading to Arg16Gly sequence changes within the 2-adrenergic receptor do not a ffect patients' responses to recommended asthma therapy with sa lmeterol and fluticasone propionate. REVIEW: Dickey BF, Walker JK, agonists in asthma. 143Curr Opin Pharmacol beta-ad renoceptor (beta-AR) inverse agonists, may be useful in the chronic treatment of asthma. This article reviews the data and the signaling pathways that may be involved. Data suggest that beta(2)-AR signaling is required to produce maximal airway inflammation and hype rresponsiveness, and the signaling pathway responsible for these effects is likely the non-canonical beta-arrestin-2 pathway. Therefore, beta- AR inverse agonists may produce their beneficial chronic effects by inhibiting constitutive or ligand-induced activation of this Formoterol versus short-acting beta-agonists relief for adults and children with asthma. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2010;(9):CD008418. Two authors independently selected trials for in clusion in the review. Randomised, parallel-arm trials of at least 12 weeks dur ation in patients of any age a nd severity of asthma. Studies randomised patients to any dose of as-needed fo rmoterol versus shor t-acting beta(2)-agonist. Concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids or ot her maintenance medication was allowed, as long as this was not part of the randomised treatm ent regimen.This review includes eight studies conducted in 22,604 participants (mos tly adults). Six studies compar ed formoterol as-needed to terbutaline whilst two studies compared form oterol with salbutamol as-needed. Background maintenance therapy varied across the trials. Asthma exacerbations and serious adverse events showed a direction of treatment effect favour ing formoterol, of which one outcome reached statistical significance (exacerbations requiring a c ourse of oral corticos teroids). In patients on short-acting beta(2)-agonists, 117 people out of 1000 had ex acerbations requiring oral corticosteroids over 30 weeks, compared to 101 (95% CI 93 to 108) out of 1000 for patients on formoterol as-needed. In patients on maintenan ce inhaled corticosteroids there were also significantly fewer exacerbations requiring a course of oral co rticosteroids on formoterol as- needed (Peto OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.91). There was one death per 1000 people on formoterol or on short-acting beta(2)-agonists. In summary, formoterol in adults was similar to short-acting beta(2)-agonists when used as a reliever, and sh owed a reduction in the number of exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids. Clinicians should weigh th e relatively modest benefits of formoterol as-needed against the benefits of si ngle inhaler therapy and the potential danger of long-term use of long-acting beta(2)-agonists in some patients. We did not find evidence to recommend changes to guidelines that suggest th at long-acting beta(2)-ago nists should be given only to patients already taking i nhaled corticosteroids.There was insufficient information reported from children in the included trials to come to any conclusion on the safety or efficacy of formoterol as relief medication for children with asthma. 3. Mast Cell Active Agents (Cromolyn / Nedocromil) EVIDENCE BASED REVIEW: Guevara JP. Ducharme FM. Keren R, et al. Inhaled corticosteroids versus sodium cromoglycat e in children and adults with asthma. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2006;19:CD003558. BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) a sodium cromoglycate (SCG) have become established as effective controlle r medications for children and adults with asthma, but their 144relative efficacy is not clear. OB JECTIVES: To comp are the rela tive effectiveness and adverse effects of ICS and SCG among children and adul ts with chronic asth ma. SEARCH STRATEGY: Systematic search of the Cochrane Airways Group's special register of controlled trials (to Feb. 2004), hand searches of the reference lists of in cluded trials and releva nt review papers, and written requests for identification of additional trials from pharmaceutical manufacturers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of ICS with SCG in children and adults with chronic asthma. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All studies were assessed independently for eligibility by thr ee review authors. Disagreements were settled by consensus. Trial authors were contacted to suppl y missing data or to verify methods. Eligible studies were abstracted and fi xed- and random-effects models were implemented to pool studies. Separate analyses were conducted for paediatric and adult studie s. Subgroup analyses and meta- regression models were fit to explore heterogeneity of lung f unction outcomes by type of RCT, category of ICS or SCG dosage, asthma severity of participants, and st udy quality on outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Of 67 identified studies, 17 tr ials involving 1279 children and eight trials involving 321 adults with asthma were eligible. Thirteen (76%) of the paedia tric studies and six (75%) of the adult studies were judged to be high quality. Among children, ICS were associated with a higher final mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] (weighted mean difference [WMD] 0.07 litres, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02 to 0.11) and higher mean final peak expiratory flow rate [PEF] (WMD 17.3 litres/minute, 95% CI 11.3 to 23.3) than SCG. In addition, ICS were associated with fewer exacerbations (W MD -1.18 exacerbations per year, 95% CI -2.15 to - 0.21), lower asthma symptom scores, and less rescue bronchodilator use than SCG. There were no group differences in the proporti on of children with adverse e ffects. Among adults, ICS were similarly associated with a higher mean final FEV1 (WMD 0.21 litres, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.28) and higher final endpoint PEF (WMD 28.2 litres/minu te, 95% CI 18.7 to 37.6) than SCG. ICS were also associated with fewer exacerbations (WMD -3.30 exacerbations per year, 95% CI -5.62 to - 0.98), lower asthma symptom scores among cross-over trials but not parallel trials, and less rescue bronchodilator use than SCG. There were no differenc es in the proportion of adults with adverse effects. In subgroup analyses involving lung functi on measures, paediatric and adult studies judged to be of high quality had resu lts consistent with the overall re sults. Lung function measures in children were higher in studies with medium BDP-equivalent steroid dosages than low BDP- equivalent dosages, while adult studies could no t be compared by steroid dosage since they all incorporated similar dosages. There were no significant differences in lung function by the asthma severity of participants for adult or child st udies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSI ONS: ICS were superior to SCG on measures of lung functio n and asthma control for both a dults and children with chronic asthma. There were few studies reporting on qual ity of life and health care utilization, which limited our ability to adequately evaluate the re lative effects of these medications on a broader range of outcomes. Although there were no differenc es in adverse effects between ICS and SCG, most trials were short and may not have been of sufficient duration to identify long-term effects. Our results support recent consensus statements in the U.S. and elsewhere that favour the use of ICS over SCG for control of persistent asthma. EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW: Sridhar AV, McKean M. Nedocromil sodium for in children. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2006;3:CD004108. 145Two authors independently ass essed trial quality and extracted data of randomized placebo controlled trials comparing nedocro mil sodium to placebo in the treatment of chronic asthma in children (0-18 years). Fifteen trials (twelve parallel group studies; three crossover trials recruiting 1422 children (837 males and 585 females)) were in cluded. The studies we re generally of good methodological quality. Two large long term studies used nedocromil for six months and four to six years and showed conflicting results in symptom free days. Short term studies (duration between 4 weeks to 12 weeks) showed that nedo cromil sodium produced some improvement in a number of efficacy measures compared to placeb o including FEV(1), FVC, FEV(1) % predicted, PC20 FEV(1), evening PEF and symptom scores. The parent's assessment of efficacy was in favour of nedocromil (odds ratio (OR) 0.5 (95% CI 0.3 to 0.8). Nedocromil sodium has a good safety profile. The only significant side effect observed was unpleasant taste. There was little evidence for a clinically dose response effect an d only a few studies recrui ted participants with severe asthma. In summary, a limited number of sm all studies have shown that nedocromil is of benefit in improving lung function and some measur es of symptoms, but the evidence with regard to the primary outcome of the review was conflicti ng. Two long-term trials did not show consistent effects on lung function outcomes, whereas several sm all short-term trials have shown benefit in these outcomes. Differing severi ties at baseline may explain this difference with milder participants experiencing less benefit, although the discrepancy between study findings may also reflect publication bias. Nedocromil sodium is asso ciated with a very good safety profile with no significant short term or long- term advers e side effects. Although nedocromil may have advantages over inhaled corticosteroids in terms of side effects, there is a need for head to head trials of nedocromil and inhaled corticosteroids to establish whether asthma control is similar, especially in mild asthma. 4. Cyclooxygenase and Leukotr iene Pathway Modulators SURVEY REPORT: Barnes N, Thomas M, Price D, et al. The national montelukast survey. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2005; cacy of montelukast for treating asthma; whether this can be extrapolated to clinical effectiveness in routine practice has yet to be established. OBJECTIVE: To examine the use, effectiveness, and tolerability of montelukast in clinical practice for treating asthma and to explor e prognostic factors that could predict a favorable response to the drug. METHODS: This was a re trospective, cross-sectional, observational study of clinical outcomes seen in patients prescribed montelukast for asthma that used routinely collected clinical information. Data were collec ted on all consenting patients who had been prescribed montelukast for asthma i rrespective of the continuation or duration of treatment. Independent observers, treating physicians, and patients assessed certain outcomes after the initiation of monteluka st, including the general asthma res ponse and changes in activity-related symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-six ce nters in the United Kingdom (20 primary care and 36 secondary care) participated. The analysis was based on 1351 eligible patients for whom essential data were available. Eight hundred thirty patients (66.4%; 95% CI, 63.8% to 69.0%) were recorded as having shown an improvement in their asthma c ontrol, and 103 (8.2%; 95% CI, 6.8% to 9.9%) experienced a dramatic improvement. The greates t proportion of patients responding was seen in those with mild to moderate asthma. Montelukas t was well tolerated; no new adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Montelukast is an effective, well-toler ated treatment for asthma in 146routine practice. The overall respons e rate and tolerability seen in this survey are similar to those reported in randomized clinical trials. EVIDE NCE BASED REVIEW: Currie in p ersistent asthma?. Chest 2005;128:2954-62. Despite the widespread use of inhaled cortic osteroids, many asthmatic patients experience persistent symptoms. In such individuals, the addition of a long-acting be ta2-agonist (LABA) is frequently more effective than dou bling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. However, the role of additional therapy with a leukotriene receptor antagoni st (LTRA) as an altern ative to an LABA has been the focus of attention in recent studies. In order to determine the overall efficacy of the pharmacologic armamentarium used in asthma, it is imperative that a comb ination of end points, including lung functi on, airway hyperresponsiveness, e ffects on underlying inflammation, symptoms, and more long-term sequelae such as exacerbations, are assessed. This evidence-based systematic review outlines the pharmacologi c properties of LABAs and LTRAs and the importance of evaluating end points in addition to lung function when assessing these drugs. We also highlight the results of a ll published studies that have perfo rmed direct comparisons of both LABAs and Clin Immunol 2010;10:370-6. This review discusses recent advances concerning the molecular mechanisms of antileukotrienes as well as their efficacy in various clinical scenarios and patient groups. REVIEW: Duroudier NP, Tulah AS, Sayers I. Leukotriene pathway Allergy generated by a series of enzymes/proteins cons tituting the LT synthetic pathway or 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway. Their function is mediated by interacting with multiple receptors. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) and LT synthesis inhib itors (LTSI) have shown clinical efficacy in asthma and more recently in allergic rhinitis . Despite growing knowledge of leukotriene biology, the molecular regulation of these inflammatory mediators remains to be fully understood. Genes encoding enzymes of the 5-LO pathway (i.e . ALOX5, LTC4S and LTA4H) and encoding for LT receptors (CYSLTR1/2 and LTB4R1/2) provide excel lent candidates for disease susceptibility and severity; however, their role remains unclear . Preliminary data also suggest that 5-LO pathway/receptor gene polymorphism can predic t patient responses to LTSI and LTRA; however, the exact mechanisms require elucidation. The aim of this review was to summarize the recent advances in the knowledge of these important me diators, focusing on genetic and pharmacogenetic aspects in the context of allergic phenotypes.

Br J Pharmacol 2008;155:305-15. The the development of phosphodies terase-4 (PDE4) inhib itors stems from an understanding of the role of PDE4 in suppressing the function of a range of inflammatory and resident cells thought to contribute toward the pathogenesis of re spiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Simila rly, numerous preclinical in vivo studies have shown that PDE4 inhibitors suppress characteri stic features of these diseases, namely, cell recruitment, activation of infl ammatory cells and physiologica l changes in lung function in response to a range of insults to the airways. These potentially beneficial actions of PDE4 inhibitors have been successfully translated in phase II and III clinical trials with roflumilast and cilomilast. However, dose limiting side effects of nausea, diarrhoea and headache have tempered the enthusiasm of this drug class for the treatment of these respiratory diseases. Strategies are being pursued in attempts to improve efficacy and reduce side effects. 5. Anticholinergics EVIDENCE BASED REVIEW: Rodrigo GJ. Rodrigo C. The role of anticholinergics in acute asthma treatment: an evidence -based evaluation. Chest 2002;121:1977-87. The role for anticholinergic medicat ions in acute asthma is not well-defined. Thus, the use of therapy with anticholinergics a nd beta(2)-agonists, either simu ltaneously or in sequence, has produced positive as well as negative results in trials. Therefore, the current recommendations for the use of these drugs in the emergency depart ment (ED) and hospital management of asthma exacerbations are not precise. This review answer s the following question: what level of evidence is available in the literature to support the use of anticholinergic medications in combination with beta(2)-agonists in acute asthma patients? We limited the search on our therapy question to systematic reviews of randomized trials and/or ra ndomized controlled trials not included in the reviews. After an extensive revi ew of the most relevant eviden ce, the following conclusions may be emphasized. (1) The use of multiple doses of ipratropium bromide are indicated in the ED treatment of children and adults with severe acu te asthma. The studies reported a substantial reduction in hospital admissions (30 to 60%; numb er needed to treat, 5 to 11) and significant 148differences in lung function favoring the combined treatment. No apparent increase in the occurrence of side effects was observed. (2) Th e use of single-dose protocols of ipratropium bromide with beta(2)-agonist trea tment produced, particularly in children with more severe acute asthma, a modest improvement in pulmonary func tion without reduction in hospital admissions; in adults, the data showed a similar increase in pulmonary function with an approximately 35% reduction in the hospital admission ra te. In patients with mild-to-moderate acute asthma, there is no apparent benefit from adding a single dose of an anticholinergic medication. KEY INVESTIGATION: Peters SP, Kunselman al. Tiotropium step-up therapy for adults with uncontrolled asthma. N Engl J Med 2010;363:1715-26. In a three-way, double-blind, triple -dummy crossover tr ial involving 210 patients with asthma, the authors evaluated the add ition of tiotropium bromide (a long-act ing anticholinergic agent approved for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmona ry disease but not asthma) to an inhaled glucocorticoid, as compared with a doubling of the dose of the inhaled glucocorticoid (primary superiority comparison) or th e addition of the LABA salmet erol (secondary noninferiority comparison). The use of tiotropium resulted in a superior primary outcome , as compared with a doubling of the dose of an inhaled glucocorticoid , as assessed by measuring the morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), with a mean differen ce of 25.8 liters per minute (P<0.001) and superiority in most secondary outcomes, including evening PEF, with a difference of 35.3 liters per minute (P<0.001); the proportion of asthma-control days, with a difference of 0.079 (P=0.01); the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) before bronchodilation, with a difference of 0.10 liters (P=0.004); and daily symptom scores, with a diffe rence of -0.11 points (P<0.001). The addition of tiotropium was also noninferior to the additi on of salmeterol for all assessed outcomes and increased the prebronchodilator FEV1 more than did salmeterol, with a difference of 0.11 liters (P=0.003). In summary, tiotropium added to an i nhaled glucocorticoid improved symptoms and lung function in patients with inad equately controlled asthma. Its eff ects appeared to be equivalent to those with the addition of salmeterol. 6. Theophylline REVIEW: Barnes PJ. Theophylline: new perspectives for an old drug. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2003;167:813-8. Theophylline has been used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for over 60 years and remains one of the most widely prescr ibed drugs for the treatment of airway diseases worldwide as it is inexpensive. In many industrialized countries, however, theophylline has recently become a third-line treatment that is only used in some poorly controlled patients. This has been reinforced by various guidelines to therapy. It has even been suggested that theophylline is not indicated in any patients with asthma. The frequency of side effects and the relatively low efficacy of theophylline have recently led to reduced usage because inhaled \u00df 2- agonists are far more effective as bronchodila tors and inhaled corticosteroids have a greater anti- inflammatory effect. Despite the long history of theophylline in asthma therapy, there has been considerable uncertainty about its mode of ac tion in the management of airway diseases and its logical place in therapy. Because of problems with side effects, there have been attempts to 149improve on theophylline, and recently there has been increas ing interest in the development of selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor. Selective PDE4 inhibitors have the possibility of improving the beneficial and reducing the adverse effects of theophylline, although existing inhibitors appear to be lim ited by the same side effects as theophylline. INVESTIGATION: Yasui K, Kondo Y, Wada T, et al. Theophylline inhibits the differentiation of human monocyte into dendritc cell potentially via adenosine receptor antagonism. Clin Exp Allergy 2009;39:1857-65. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of theophylline on human monocyte differentiation into DCs and whether this involved antagonism of adenosine receptors. Peripheral human blood monocytes were cultured in th e presence of granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor and IL-4 to induce DC di fferentiation. The cells were incubated with theophylline, KF17837 inhibitor (rolipram) and adenosin e deaminase (ADA) to determine their effects on DC differentiation. In additi on, depletion of adenosine rece ptors by small interfering RNA (siRNA) was also examined.Monocytes differentiate d into myeloid DCs in the culture system. The number of DCs was reduced by 60-70% when the ophylline was administer ed at a therapeutic concentration. This effect was concentration-de pendently exacerbated, was partly mediated by cellular apoptosis and was effectiv ely reversed by the addition of the A1 agonists depletion of the adenosine A1 receptor by siRNA and addition of ADA remarkably reduced DC diffe rentiation. Meanwhile, both enprofylline and rolipram had little effect.The aut hors suggest that the adenosine A1 (and possibly coordinated with A2a) receptors contribute to DC differentiation and survival. Bras Dermatol. 2010 Apr;85(2):195-210. Drugs with antihistami ne action are the most commonly prescribed medication in daily dermatologic practice, both to adu lts and children. This article addresses new concepts of the role of histamine receptors (H1 receptors) and discusse s the anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs. Second generation antihistamines differs from first generation because of their high specificity and affinity for peripheral H1-receptors. Second gene ration antihistamines are also less likely to produce sedation because they have less effect on the central nervous system. Although the efficacy of the various H1-antihistamines in the treatme nt of allergic patients is similar, even when comparing first- and second-generation drugs, these drugs are still very different in terms of their chemical structure, pharmacology and toxic pr operties. Consequently, knowledge of their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristi cs is essential for a better medical care, especially that offered to pregnant women, childre n, the elderly, and patients with comorbidities. REVIEW: 150Simons FE. Advances in H1 2004 November: peer-reviewed articles amine and the H1-antihistami nes have been publishedsince this subject was last reviewed in the Journal a decade ago. The role of histamine in neurotransmission, allergic inflammation, and imm une modulation has been further elucidated sincethat time. The human H1-histamine and H2-histamine receptors were cloned and characterized in the early 1990s, as were the hu man H3-histamine and H4-histamine receptors several years ago. H1-antihistamines, historica lly known as histamine H1-receptor blockers or antagonists, are specific for the H1-receptor. In addition, some H1-antihistamines inhibit transmission through the muscarinic, - adrene rgic, and serotonin re ceptors and through ion channels. The H1-antihistamines have recently been re classified as inverse a gonists, rather than as H1-receptor antagonists, which is consonant with an increased understanding of their molecular pharmacologic features. More than 40 H1-antihista mines are available worldwide \u2014 indeed, these agents are among the most widely used of all me dications. The H1-antihistamines astemizole and terfenadine, which are associated with cardiac toxic effects, ar e no longer approved for use. New H1-antihistamines have been developed and in troduced. Both health care professionals and consumers generally assume that all approved H1-antihistamines have been shown to be efficacious and safe, but many medications in this class, in particular those introduced before 1985, have not been optimally studied in rando mized, double-blind, controlled trials. This discussion of the differences in the clinical pharmacology and the similarities in efficacy and safety of the H1-antihistamines is based on a review of the literature published since 1994. REVIEW: O'Donoghue M, Tharp MD. Antihistamines and their role as antipruritics. Dermatology Therapy. Vol 18, 2005: 333-340. Antihistamines that bind to the histamine 1 recepto r (H1) serve as important therapeutic agents to counter the effects of histamine in the skin. Two generations of antih istamines exist: however, second generation agents are more advantageous because they cause less sedation, have a longer life and are more selective for the H1 receptor. While H1 antihistamines have proven to be effective at reversing the pruritus and cutaneous lesions of chronic urticaria, their ability to treat pruritus associated with other cutane ous and systemic disease is unproven. REVIEW: Akdis CA, Simons FER. Histamine receptors J of Pharmacology 533 (2006): 69-76 . In addition to its well-characterized effects in th e acute allergic inflamma tory responses, histamine has been demonstrated to affect chronic inflamma tion and regulate several e ssential events in the immune response. Histamine can selectively recruit the major effector cells into tissue sites and affect their maturation, activation, polarizati on, and other functions leading to chronic inflammation. Histamine also regulates dendritic cells, T cells and B cells, as well as related antibody isotype responses. In addition, acting through its receptor 2, histamine positively interferes with the peripheral antigen tolerance induced by T regul atory cells in several pathways. The diverse effects of histamine on immune regulat ion appear to be due to differential expression 151and regulation of 4 types of histamine receptors a nd their distinct intracel lular signals. In addition, differences in affinities of these receptorsfor histamine is highly decisive for the biological effects of histamine and drugs that target histamine recept ors. This article highlight s recent discoveries in histamine immunobiology and discusses their relevance in allergic inflammation. 8. Immunosuppressive Agents REVIEW: Kazlow Stern D, Tripp JM, Ho use of Systemic Dermatology: An Update. In addition to corticosteroids, dermatologist s have to an array of Azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cy closporine, and mycophenolate mofetil are the systemic immunosuppressive agents most commonly used by dermatologists. In addition, new developments in biotechnology have spurred the development of immunobiologic agents that are able to target the immunologic process of many inflammatory disorders at specific points along the inflammatory cascade. Alefacept, efalizumab, etanercept, and infliximab are the immunobiologic agents that are currently the most well known and most commonly used by dermatologists. This article reviews the pharm acology, mechanism of action, side effects, and clinical applications of these therapies. REVIEW sirolimus: Bond Stenton S, Partovi N, Ensom HH. Pharmacokinet 2005; 44(8): 769-786. This review seeks to apply a decision-mak ing algorithm to establish whether clinical pharmacokinetic monitoring (CPM) of sirolimus (ra pamycin) in solid organ transplantation is indicated in specific patient populations. The ne ed for CPM of sirolimus, although a regulatory requirement in Europe, has not yet been firmly es tablished in North America and other parts of the world.Sirolimus has demonstrated immunosuppressive efficacy in renal, pancreatic islet cell, liver and heart transplant recipients. The pharmacological response of immunos uppressive therapy with sirolimus cannot be readily evaluated; howev er, a relationship between trough blood sirolimus concentrations, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and the incidence of rejection has been proposed. Furthermore, sirol imus can be measured in whole blood by several assays--high-performance liquid chromatography with detection by tandem mass spectrometry, or with ultraviolet detection, ra dioreceptor assay or micropar ticle enzyme immunoassay. Both experimental animal and clinical data suggest that adverse events and their associated severity are correlated with blood con centrations. To prevent rejection an d minimise toxicity, a therapeutic range of 4-12 microg/L (measured via chromatogra phic assays) is recommended when sirolimus is used in conjunction with ciclosporin. If ciclospori n therapy is discontinued, a target trough range of 12-20 microg/L is recomme nded. Sirolimus pharmacokinetic s display large inter- and intrapatient variability, which may change in specific patient populat ions due to disease states or concurrent immunosuppressants or othe r interacting drugs. Due to the long half-life of sirolimus, dosage adjustments would ideally be based on tr ough levels obtained more than 5-7 days after initiation of therapy or dosage change. Once th e initial dose titration is complete, monitoring sirolimus trough concentrations weekly for the first month and every 2 weeks for the second month appears to be appropriate. After the first 2 months of dose titration, routine CPM of 152sirolimus is not necessa ry in all patients, but may be warranted to achieve target concentrations in certain populations of patients, but the frequency of further monito ring remains to be determined and should be individualized. 9. Immunomodulatory medications REVIEW: Liossis SNC, Tsokos GC. Monoclonal Humanized antibodies and decoy re have been introduced in clinical practice to treat malignancies and systemic autoimmune disease b ecause they ablate spec ific cells or disrupt pathogenic processes at distinct points. Reported clin ical responses offer hope to treatment- resistant patients, particularly t hose with lymphomas and rheumatic diseases. Side effects from the use of biologic agents include lymphokine rel ease syndrome, reactivation of tuberculosis, and immunosuppression. Further insights are needed regarding limitation of adverse effects, correct use in conjunction with existing drugs, and treatment of patients in whom resistance develops. REVIEW omalizumab: Holgate S, Casale T, Wenzel S, The anti-inflammatory effects of omalizumab co nfirm the central role of IgE in allergic inflammation J Allergy Clin Immuno l 2005; 115(3):459-465. Anti-IgE therapy with le vels of free IgE and downregulates expression of IgE receptors (Fc RI) on mast cells and basophils. In the ai rways of patients with mild allergic asthma, omalizumab reduces FcRI+ and IgE+ cells and cause s a profound reduction in tissue eosinophilia, together with reductions in submucos al T-cell and B-cell numb ers. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, oma lizumab inhibits the allergen-induced seasonal increases in circulating and tissue eosinoph ils. Omalizumab decreases Fc RI expression on circulating dendritic cells, which might lead to a reduction in allergen pr esentation, TH2 cell activation, and proliferation. As a systemic anti-IgE agent, omalizumab has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with moderate and severe allergic asthma and in those with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, as well as in patients with concomitant allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis. The anti- inflammatory effects of omalizumab at different sites of allergic inflammation and the clinical benefits of anti-IgE therapy in patients with al lergic asthma and allergic rhinitis emphasize the fundamental importance of IgE in allergicinflammation. REVIEW: Yamagata T, Ichinose M. Agents against Eur J Pharmacol 2006; 533(1-3): 289-301 Various cytokines play a critical role in pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory lung diseases including asthma and chronic obs tructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The increasing evidence of the involvement of these cytokines in the development of airway inflammation raises the possibility that these cytokines may become th e novel promising therapeutic targets. Studies concerning the inhibition of interleukin (IL)-4 have been discontinued despite promising early 153results in asthma. Although blocki ng antibody against IL-5 markedly reduces the infiltration of eosinophils in peripheral blood a nd airway, it does not seem to be effective in symptomatic asthma, while blocking IL-13 might be more ef fective. On the contrary, anti-inflammatory cytokines themselves such as IL-10, IL-12, IL -18, IL-23 and interferon-gamma may have a therapeutic potential. Inhibition of TNF-alpha may also be useful in severe asthma or COPD. Many chemokines are also involved in the infl ammatory response of asthmaand COPD through the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Several small molecule inhi bitors of chemokine receptors are now in development for the treatment of asth ma and COPD. Antibodies that block IL-8 reduce ptor antagonists, which block eosinophil chemotaxis, are now in clinical development fo r asthma therapy. As many cytokines areinvolved in the pathophysiology of inflammatory lung diseases, inhibitory agents of the synthesis of multiple cytokines may be more useful tools. Several such agents are now in clinical development. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Corry DB, Kheradmand F. Control of Allergy Clin Immunol Among the asthma clinical trials pu blished over the last several y ears, a unique subset has focused on novel means for inhibiting the airway inflammation that is believed to cause airway obstruction in many patients. Such interventions, broadl y considered here as immune-modifying or immunomodulatory therapies, include ne w atast anti- cytokine antibodies, soluble recepto rs, and recombinant cytokines and bacterial extracts. In this chapter we review the major findings with these clin ical trials and indicate which have changed the management of asthma, which have not, and those that deserve further study. 10. Agents and principles of a erosolized respiratory treatments REVIEW: Dolovich MB, Ahrens JL, aerosol therapy: Evidence-based guidelines: American College 127(1): 335-71 BACKGROUND: The proliferation of inhaler devi ces has resulted in a confusing number of choices for clinicians who are se lecting a delivery device for aerosol therapy. There are advantages and disadvantages associated with each device category. Evidence-based guidelines for the selection of the appropri ate aerosol delivery device in specific clinical settings are needed. AIM: (1) To compare the efficacy and adverse effects of treatment using nebulizers vs pressurized metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) w ith or spacer/holding ch amber vs dry powder inhalers (DPIs) as delivery systems for be taagonists, anticholinergic agents , and corticosteroids for several commonly encountered clinical settings and patient populat ions, and (2) to provide recommendations to clinicians to aid them in sel ecting a particular aerosol delivery device for their patients. METHODS: A systematic review of pe rtinent randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) was undertaken using MEDLINE, EmBase, and the Cochrane Library databases. A broad search strategy was chosen, combining terms related to aerosol devices or drugs with the diseases of interest in various patient groups and clinical settings. Only RCTs in which the same drug was 154administered with different devices were included. RCTs (394 trials) assessing inhaled corticosteroid, beta2-agonist, and antichol inerg ic agents delivered by an MDI, an MDI with a spacer/holding chamber, a nebulizer, or a DPI were identified for the years 1982 to 2001. A total of 254 outcomes were tabulated. Of the 131 studies that met the eligibility criteria, only 59 (primarily those that test ed beta2-agonists) proved to ha ve useable data. RESULTS: None of the pooled metaanalyses showed a significa nt difference between devices in any efficacy outcome in any patient group for each of the clini cal settings that was in vestigated. The adverse effects that were reported were minimal and we re related to the increased drug dose that was delivered. Each of the delivery devices provided similar outcomes in patients using the correct technique for inhalation. CONCLU SIONS: Devices used for the delivery of bronchodilators and steroids can be equally efficacious. When selecting an aerosol delivery device for patients with asthma and COPD, the following should be consider ed: device/drug availability ; clinical setting; patient age and the ability to use the selected device correctly; device use with multiple medications; cost and reimbursement; drug administration time; convenience in both outpatient and inpatient settings; and phys ician and patient preference. Clin Immunol 2006; 112(3): S1-140 Inhaled corticosteroids play a pivot al role in the treatment of asthma. Inhalation permits effective delivery of the corticosteroid in high concentration to target site s within the lung while minimizing systemic exposure. Consequently, the safety profile of inhaled corticosteroids is markedly better thanthat of oral corticosteroid therapy. However, although it was fi rst thought that direct delivery mighteliminate systemic adverse effects, this has not been confirmed by clinical trials and experience. Inhaled corticosteroids are absorbed fr om the lungs into the systemic circulation, in which they can acutely decrease growth velocity in children, an effect that fortunately appears to be temporary and might have no effect on final adult height. In sufficient dosages, they also produce bone mineral loss leading to osteoporosis and might increase the risk of cataracts, glaucoma, skin atrophy, and vascular changes that increase the risk of ecchymoses. Effective evaluation of the severity and significance of th ese complications is challenging because highly sensitive tests do not reliably predict clinically significant events, and shor t-term observations do not predict long-term consequences. Also, comp liance wanes with long-term treatment, and susceptibility to a particular ad verse event can vary over time, even in the same individual, because of developmental or hormonal changes. This journal supplement will review what has been learned about the safety of inhaled cortico- steroids during the past decade, discussing some of the questions that remain and considering the ch aracteristics of an \"ideal \" inhaled corticosteroid: one with high local activity in the lung a nd minimal or no adverse systemic effects. 11. Topical Dermatologic and Ophthalmologic Therapy a. dermatologic REVIEW T, A, Spergel J. Immunomodulation and Safety of Topical Calcineu rin Inhibitors in flammatory skin condition that primarily af fects children. Topical corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment since the late 1950s. While providing excellent short-term ef ficacy, topical corticosteroid usage is limited by potential adverse effects, including impairmen t of the function and viability of Langerhans cells/dendritic cells. The recently introduced 1% (Elidel) and tacrolimus ointment 0.03 and 0.1% (Pro topic) exhibit a more selective mechanism of action and do not affect Langerhans cells/dendritic cells. For the immune system of young children 'learning' to mount a balanced Th1/Th2 response, th is selective effect has particular benefits. In clinical experience, topical calc ineurin inhibitors have been s hown to be a safe and effective alternative to topical corticosteroids in almost 7 million patients (>5 million on pimecrolimus; >1.7 million on tacrolimus). Topical pimecrolimus is primarily used in children with mild and moderate AD, whereas tacrolimus is used preferentially in more severe cases. None of the topical calcineurin inhibitors have been associated with system ic immunosuppression-relate d malignancies known to occur following long-term sustained systemic immunosuppression with or al immunosuppressants (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine A, and corticostero ids) in transplant pa tients. Preclinical and clinical data suggest a greater skin selectivity and larger safety margin for topical pimecrolimus.

Br J Dermatol 2003;148: 128-133 BACKGROUND: Topical steroids as th e first-line therapy for atopic dermatitis. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical doses of t opical steroids for the da ily treatment of atopic dermatitis in clinics and to elucidate their adverse effects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicentre retrospective analysis of a series of 1271 patie nts (210 infants, 546 children, and 515 adolescents and adults) with atopic dermatitis . RESULTS: Less than 89.5 g, 135 g and 304 g of topical steroid were applied in 90% of the pa tients in the infant, childhood, and adolescent and adult AD groups, respectively, on the entire bod y during the 6-month treatment period. The majority of patients were controlled well; howev er, 7% of infant, 10% of childhood and 19% of adolescent and adult patients remained in a very severe or severe state or experienced exacerbation even though they applied larger amounts of topical steroids. With regard to adverse effects, the 156incidence of telangiectasia on ch eeks tended to increase in patients who had a longer duration of disease and who applied more than 20 g to the face during the 6-month treatm ent period. The steroid-induced atrophy of the ante cubital and popliteal fossae was more frequently observed in males than in females. CONCLUSIONS: Topical st eroids are useful for treating atopic dermatitis, but a substantial percentage of patients cannot be satisfactorily tr eated with topical steroids. For such patients, adjustments of dose and rank of topical steroids and other th erapeutic adjuncts are necessary. b. ophthalmologic REVIEW antihistamines: Bielory L, Bigelsen S Antihi 215-228 Treatment for allergic conjunctivitis has ma rkedly expanded in recent years, providing opportunities for more focused therapy, but often l eaving both physicians and patients confused over the variety of options. As monotherapy, oral antihistamines are an excellent choice when attempting to control multiple early-phase, and some late-phase, allergic symptoms in the eyes, nose and pharynx. Unfortunately, despite their efficacy in relief of allerg ic symptoms, systemic antihistamines may result in unwanted adverse eff ects, such as drowsiness and dry in orde r to avoid the sedative and anticholinergic effects that are associated with fi rst-generation agents. When the allergic symptom or complaint, such as ocular pruritus, is isol ated, focused therapy with topical (ophthalmic) antihistamines is often efficacious and clearly superior to systemic antihistamines, either as monotherapy or in conjunction with an oral or intranasal agent. Topical antihistaminic agents not only provide faster and superior relief than systemic antihistamines, but they may also possess a longer duration of action than other classes includ ing vasoconstrictors, pure mast cell stabilisers, NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Many antihistamine s have anti-inflammatory properties as well. Some of this anti-inflammatory effect seen with 'pure' antihistamines (levocabastine and emedastine) may be directly attributed to the bl ocking of the histamine receptor that has been shown to downregulate intercellu lar adhesion molecule-1 expressi on and, in turn, chemotaxis of inflammatory cells. Some topical multiple-action histamine H(1)- receptor antagonists (olopatadine, ketotifen, azelastine and shown to prevent activation of neutrophils, eosinophils and macropha ges, or inhibit release of leukotrienes, plateletactivating factors and other inflammatory mediators. Topica l vasoconstrictor agents provide rapid relief, especially for redness; however, the relief is ofte n short-lived, and overuse of vasoconstrictors may lead to rebound hyperaemia and irritation. Another class of topical agents , mast stabilizers (sodium lodoxamide), may be considered; however, they generally have a much slower onset of action. The efficacy of mast cell stabilisers may be attributed to anti-inflammatory properties in addition to mast cell st abilisation. In the class of topical NSAIDs, ketorolac has been promoted for ocular itching but has been found to be inferior for relief of allergic conjunctivitis when compared with olopatadine and emedastine. Lastly, topical corticosteroids may be considered for severe seasonal oc ular allergy symptoms, although long-term use should be avoided because of risks of ocular adverse effects, including glaucoma and cataract formation. 157 REVIEW Immunosuppressive and non-steroidal agents: Hemady, RK, and Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs for Ocular Immune and Inflammatory Disorders Ophthalmology Clinics of North America 2005; 18(4): 511-528 We now have at our disposal several nonsteroidal immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agentsthat may be used in addition to or instead of corticosteroids to treat ocular diseases. This articlediscusses some of the immunosuppressive mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, indications, dose a nd route, adverse effects, monitoring are discussed for each drug. REVIEW: Histamine Receptors and the Conjunctiva Bielory 5(5): 437-440 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to evalua te the effect of histamine on various receptors in the conjunc tiva. A Medline search from 1980 was performed on the histamine receptor subtypes H1, H2 and H3 in the hum an conjunctiva. RECENT FINDINGS: In the conjunctiva, histamine has been shown to i nduce various physiologi cal and immunological changes through inositol phosphate pathway leads to the symptom of pruritus while histamine stimulati on of the conjunctival H2 receptors has been indirectly shown to cause vas odilation. SUMMARY: The effect of histamine on conjunctival H1 receptors appears to be the primary target for ocular allergy treatment as it is primarily involved in ocular pruritus. The exact intera ction of the conjunctival H2 receptors appears to work in a complementary fashion to the H1 receptor in contro lling other features of ocular allergy such as vasodilation and injection. Thus, oral and topica l antihistamines with multiple histamine receptor binding activities may provide an improved treatment paradigm for the various signs and symptoms of ocular allergy. The histamine H1, H2 and H3 receptor affinities of ketotifen, pyrilamine, and epinastine appear to have the strongest H1 and H2 affinities. 12 . Vaccines against transmissible agents REVIEW: Moylett EH, Hanson IC The Immune System. Immunization J Allergy Clin Immunol 2003; 111(2), S754-65 The medical dictionary defines im munization as the \"protection of susceptible individuals from communicable diseases by the administration of a living modified agent, a suspension of killed organisms, or an inactivated toxin.\" This elegan t description can be expa nded to include twenty- first century approaches to immunization that include recombinant tec hnology, reassortment virus techniques, live vect ors, DNA vaccines, and the expansi on of the field to encompass 158noncommunicable diseases such as A lzhei mer's disease, autoimmunity, and tumor immunogenetics. Integral to the su ccess of immunization is our know ledge of the immune system's memory of antigens, yet our understanding of th is fundamental feature remains limited. On a global scale, communicable diseases remain the number-one cause of morbidity and mortality; hence Jenner's pioneering work with its birth in 1796 still has a challenging and exciting future. REVIEW: Wu JJ, Huang DB, Pang KR, Tyring SK Vaccines and immunotherapies for the prevention of infectious diseases having cutaneous manifestations J Am Acad Dermatol 2004; 50:495-528. Although the development of antimicrobial drugs has advanced rapidly in the past several years, such agents act against only certain groups of mi crobes and are associated with increasing rates of resistance. These limitations of treatment force p hysicians to continue to rely on prevention, which is more effective and cost-effective than therapy. From the use of the smallpox vaccine by Jenner in the 1700s to the current concerns about biologic warfare, the technology for vaccine development has seen numerous advances. The currently available vaccines for viral illnesses include Dryvax for smallpox; the combination m easles, inactivated for hepatitis A; vaccine fo r hepatitis B; and the live attenuated Oka strain vaccine for varicella zoster. Vaccin es available against bacterial illnesses include those for anthrax, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Currently in development for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes are vaccine s for HIV, herpes simplex virus, and human papillomavirus. Other vaccines being investigated for prevention are those for cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, para influenza virus, hepatitis C, an d dengue fever, among many others. Fungal and protozoan diseases are also subjec ts of vaccine research. Among immunoglobulins approved for prophylactic and therapeutic use are t hose against cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A and B, measles, rabies, and tetanus. With this progre ss, it is hoped that effective vaccines soon will be developed for many more infectious dis eases with cutaneous manifestations. 13. Drug interactions BRIEF REVIEW: Tom Revzon, C. Drug Interactions Pediatrics in Review 2006; 27: 315-317 Short overview of the pharmacology of drug interac tions; a list of references (articles, books, web sites and PDA programs on drug interactions). REVIEW: Shapiro LE, Knowles, SR, Shear NH Drug Interactions of Clinical Significance for the Dermatologist Am J Clin Dermatol 2003; 4(9): 623-639 While it would be impossible for any dermatologist to remember all potential drug interactions, knowledge of the mechanisms of drug interactions can help redu ce the risk of serious adverse outcomes. Most drugs are associated with interac tions but the majority do not produce significant outcomes. Dealing with drug interactions is a challenge in all clinical practice, including dermatology. New information continues to appear , and dermatologists need to know about the 159drugs they use. This article focuses on the mechanis m s of drug interactions. In particular, the life of a drug in terms of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion are reviewed with the focus on points of importance and relevance to dr ug interactions. The most clinically important drug interactions in dermatologi cal practice are caused by altera tions in drug metabolism. The contributions of P-glycoprotei n, pharmacogenetic variation and genetic polymorphisms to drug interactions are highlighted, and the best eviden ce for drug interactions involving drug classes relevant to the dermatologist is presented. Since the initial evid ence for clinically relevant drug interactions comes from case reports, prescribi ng physicians can have a major role in collating information on interactions. By understanding th e mechanisms behind drug interactions and staying alert for toxicities, we can help make drug therapy safer and reduce the fear of drug interactions. REVIEW: Manzi SF, Shannon M. Drug Interactions - a review Clin Ped Emerg Med 2005; 6:93-102 The incidence and severity of drug interactions ar e on the rise as more me dications are brought to market. Following the absorption, distribu tion, metabolism and excretion model of pharmacokinetics, this review will provide an ov erview of the varied mechanisms of drug-drug, drug-herb, and drug-food interactions with emphasis placed on the interactions most likely to cause harm. This information is intended to assist the pediatric emergency physician in recognizing drug interactions to identify and remove the offending agent when appropriate. Understanding the mechanisms of drug interactions will assist all clinicians in avoiding these serious, often preventable, events. REVIEW: Warringon JS, 487-503. the advent of new immunosuppressants and formulations, the elucidation of molecular targets and the evolution of therapeutic drug m onitoring, the field of organ transplantation has witnessed significant reductions in acute rejectio n rates, prolonged graft survival and improved patient outcome. Nonetheless, challenges persist in the use of immunosuppressive medications. Marked interindividual variabil ity remains in drug concentrations and drug response. As medications with narrow therapeu tic indices, variations in imm unosuppressant concentrations can result in acute toxicity or tran splant rejection. Recent studies have begun to id entify factors that contribute to this vari ability with the promis e of tailoring immunosuppressive regimens to the individual patient. These advances have uncove red differences in genetic composition in drug- metabolising enzymes, drug transporters and drug targets. This review focuses on commonly used maintenance pharmacogenetic differences in drug-metabolising en zymes, drug transporters and drug targets and addresses common drug-drug interact ions with immunosuppressant ther apies. The potential drug-metabolising enzymes in contri buting to these drug-drug inter actions is briefly considered. 160 B. Allergenic Proteins and Extr acts for Diagnosis and Treatment 1.

A major component of the urban jungle is the urban forest\u2014the assemblage of trees, shrubs, and other plants that occupy the urban and suburban z ones.

J Allergy Clin Immunol 2003; 112: 229-39; quiz 240 There are many proteins, presumably performing vital functions, that are tightly preserved throughout the evolutionary tree from plants to animals, such as prof ilins, lipid transfer proteins, and pathogenesis-rela ted proteins. These might function as panallergens. The small differences that exist between these ubiquitous proteins e xplain why these are frequently minor allergens not reacting in th e majority of allergic sera. This review summarizes cross-reactivity studies with bot h crude pollen extracts and purified or recombinant allergenic proteins and the techniques used to assess the differences and similarities among extracts. The patterns of cross-allergenicity that emerge should be helpful in guiding both diagnos tic and therapeutic decisions. REVIEW: Robert E.

The clinical rele vance of the varying degrees of cross-reactivity among the fungal antigens has been neither fully appreciated nor 161applied to clinical practice. In addition, an increasing number of potentially new fungal allergen sour ces for which commercial extracts are not available are being identified. Currently there are no standardi zed fungal allergen products av ailable in the United States because of inherent difficultie s with manufacturing and standa rdizing fungal extracts.

RESEARCH FRONTIER: Kaul S Monoclonal IgE antibodies against birch polle n allergens: novel t ools for biological characterization of allergens. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2003; 111: 1262-8 Although this article concentrates on birch allergens, the clinic al utility may be are broad applicable. Allergen characteri zation and standardiz ation is usually ba sed on the sera of allergic patients, whereas monoclonal IgE antibodies specific for clinically relevant allergens are very rare. The aim of this study was to establish IgE mAbs specific for birch pollen allergens, using IgE hybridomas.because these are important inhalant allergens. The obtained IgE mAbs were characterized by immunologic methods and by cDNA sequencing. Seven IgE mAbs specific for the birch pollen al lergens Bet v 1 or Bet v 6 were obtained and were all biologically active in mast cell-base d assays. Mediator release experiments with mAb combinations indicated th at 2 different epitope regions were recognized on Bet v 1, whereas the 2 Bet v 6-specific mAbs bound to th e same epitope region. After sensitization of rat basophilic leukemia cells with IgE mAbs , different amounts of Bet v 1 or Bet v 6 were detected in commercial diagnostic alle rgen reagents, whereas sensitization with polyclonal IgE resulted in similar allergenic potency of all products : IgE mAbs represent promising novel tools for allergen characteri zation and standardization of allergen 52: 99-106 This is a of recent progress in molecular cloning of fungal allergens and the availability of more than 40 completely sequenced fungal genomes.

This paper 162reports on studies of allerg to different cockroach allergens has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: We sought to quantitate serum IgE and IgG antibodies to a panel of purified cockroach allergens among co ckroach-sensitized subjects. METHODS: IgE antibodies to cockroach allergens (rBla g 1, rBla g 2, rBla g 4, rBla g 5, and rPer a 7) were measured in sera containing IgE antibodies to Blattella germanica extract (n = 118) by using a streptavidin CAP assay and a multiplex flow cytometric assay. Specific antibodies were determined by using radioimmunoprecipitation t echniques. RESULTS: Specific IgE antibodies measured by means of CAP assay and multiplex assa y were strongly correlated ( r = 0.8, P < .001). The sum of IgE antibodies (in international units per milliliter) against all 5 allergens equated to IgE antibodies to cockroach extr act. Although the prevalence of IgE antibodies was highest for rBla g 2 (54.4%) and rBla g 5 (37.4%), patterns of IgE antibody binding were unique to each subject. Surprisingly, only 16% of cockroach-sensitized subjects wi th IgE antibodies to house dust mite exhibited IgE antibody binding to cockroach tropomyosin (rPer a 7). Specific IgE antibodies were associated with increased IgG antibody leve ls, although detection of IgG in the absence of IgE was not uncommon. CONCLUSION: The techni ques described offer a new approach for defining the hierarchy of purified allergens. IgE an tibodies directed against 5 allergens constitute the majority of the IgE antibody repertoire for cockroach. Such distinct patterns of IgE-IgG responsiveness to different cockro ach allergens highlight the comp lexity of B-cell responses to environmental allergens. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Hoffman DR Sol i 1, the phospholipase allergen of imported fire ant venom. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2005; 115: 611-6 BACKGROUND: Sol i 1, the venom phospholipase of imported fire ant venom is an important allergen and exhibits some cross-reactivity with IgE antibodies from patients sensitized to other Hymenoptera venoms. OBJECTIVE: To determine th e primary structure of Sol i 1 and evaluate the roles of protein and carbohydr ate epitopes in its cross-reactivity. METHODS: Sol i 1 was purified from venom, proteolytic peptides pr epared and amino acid sequences obtained. The cDNA for Sol i 1 was cloned, sequenced, and comp ared with sequences of other wasp venom phospholipases. The role of carbohydrate epitopes in the cross-reactivity with other Hymenoptera venoms was studied by RAST inhibition. RESULTS: The sequence identified Sol i 1 as a lipase of the GX class, lipoprotein phospholipases as are the vespid venom phospholipases. The 148 residues identified by amino acid sequencing represent about 48% of th e translated cDNA sequence. Sol i 1 was 31-32% identical to yellow jacket phospholip ases. The identical regions of sequence were clustered in the domain which forms the serine hydrolase active site. Mannosylated N-gly cans could completely inhibit binding of IgE from honeybee venom sensitized patients to Sol i 1. Inhibition by glycan of 163IgE binding from yellow jacket venom sensitized patients was low or absent for three of eight sera and substantial, but not com plete for five sera. CONCLUSIONS: Sol i 1 is related to wasp venom phospholipases. Cross-reactivity with honeybee ve nom is caused by carbohydrate, whereas cross- reactivity with yellow jacket venom involves re activity with both carbohydr ate determinants of hyaluronidase and high molecular and phospholipase protein determinants.

Despite its use in c linical practice, more defined and safer allergy vaccine preparations are required. Differences between epitopes of IgE that recognize the 3-dimensiona l structure of allergens and T cells that recognize linear amino acid sequences provide a suitable tool for novel vaccine development for specific immunotherapy. The aim of the study was to delete B-cell epitopes and prevent IgE crosslinking, but to preserve T-cell epitopes by fusion of 2 major allergens of bee venom because of a change in the conformation. Reassessing the role of hyaluronidas e in yellow jacket venom allergy. Jin C J Allergy Clin Immunol- 2010; 125: 184-90.e1 Hyaluronidase is a minor venom a llergen, and only 10% to 15% of patients with yellow jacket allergy are estimated to have IgE ag ainst the hyaluronidase pr otein.

Indoor allergens: relevance of major alle rgen measurements and standardization. Van Ree R. Journal of Allergy and Clinic al Immunology 2007; 119(2): 270-7; quiz 278-9 Major allergen measurements have relevance for the standardization of allergen extracts for immunotherapy and for epidemiologic studies into the cause of allergic diseas es. It is necessary to add major allergen measurements to standardiz ation requirements to design adequate dosage schemes and elucidate the dose-response relation between major allergen dose and therapeutic effect. This will also help clarify to what extent sublingual immunothe rapy requires higher doses of major allergen. Standardiza tion should be based on certified major allergen references and accompanying assays that are cross-reactive enough to recognize all vari ants to facilitate comparability.

Collection methods involving impaction, impingement, and filtration allow recovery of increasingly small aerosol unit s and do so \"per unit volume of processed air\" with more or less well-defined efficiency. These principles offer direction in choosing sampling devices for specific applications; similarly, a particle's appearance, growth potential, and assayability define the scope of relevant analyses. Where a variety of aerosol types occur, multiple collection and/or analytic appro aches might be required. The development of a sampling grid in 165North America ma kes possible studies of distribution, transport, and climatic effects in ways never previously possible; however, some directive plan ning and oversight are esse ntial to realize these goals.

Longitudinal evaluation of allergen and cultur able fungal Environ Seasonal variation of cat and cockroach allergens was negligible compared with the variability associated with residential characteristics such as race/ethnicity, family income, and the presence of cats. Fungal concentrations showed significant seasonal variation that out weighed the variability associated with residential characteristics. The au thors conclude that a single measurement of cat allergen is a reasonable surrogate for long-term average exposure, since repeated measurements over time were highly correlated. Total culturabl e fungi require greater than nine repeated measurements for robust assessment of long-term exposures because of low correlations in fungal measures over time. Projections of the effects of climate change on allergic asthma: the contribution of aerobiology. Cecchi L Allergy 2010; 65(9): 1073-81. Climate has already had an impact on living orga nisms, including plants and fungi with current scenarios projecting further effects by the end of the century. Over the last three decades, studies have shown changes in production, dispersion and allergen content of pollen and spores, which may be region- and species-specific. In addition, these changes may have been influenced by urban air pollutants interacting directly with pollen. Data suggest an increasing effect of aeroallergens on allergic patients over this period, which may also imply a greater likelihood of the development of an allergic respiratory disease in sensitized subj ects and exacerbation of symptomatic patients.

The study was performed to assess separately the deteriorati on during storage in allergen extract potency caused by dilution or by mixture with allergen ex tracts that have been reported to contain proteases. Bermuda grass, cat, and house dust mite extracts incurred signi ficant loss of potency at all dilutions with storage. Short ragweed was stable at all dilutions. Potency of extracts of timothy grass, Bermuda grass, Russian thistle, wh ite oak, box elder, and cat were all reduced by combination with one or more extracts potenti ally containing proteases . Only short ragweed and D. farinae, which was in a final concentratio n of 25% glycerin, were resistant.

Experimental design REVIEW Descriptive Studies: Grimes DA, Schulz KF Descriptive studies: what they can and cannot do. Lancet. 2002 Jan 12;359:145-9. Descriptive studies often represent the first scientific to e in the water in new areas of inquiry. A fundamental element of descriptiv e reporting is a clear, specific, and measurable definition of the disease or condition in question. Like newspape rs, good descriptive reporting answers the five basic W questions: who, what, why, when, where. and a sixth: so what? Case reports, case-series reports, cross-sectional studies , and surveillance studies deal with individuals, whereas ecological correlational studies ex amine populations. The case report is the least-publishable unit in medical literature. Case-series reports aggregate individual cases in one publication. Clustering of unusual cases in a short period of ten heralds a new epidemic, as happened with AIDS. Cross-sectional (prevalence) studies describe th e health of populations. Surveillance can be thought of as watchfulness over a community; feedback to those who need to know is an integral component of surveillance. Ecological correlational studies look for associations between exposures and outcomes in populations-eg, per capita cigarett e sales and rates of coronary artery disease-rather th an in individuals. Three importa nt uses of descriptive studies include trend analysis, health -care planning, and hypothesis gene ration. A frequent error in reports of descriptive studies is overstepping the data: studies without a comparison group allow no inferences to be drawn about associations, causal or otherwise. H ypotheses about causation from descriptive studies are often te sted in rigorous analytical studies. REVIEW Case Control Studies: Grimes DA, Schutz KF Case-control studies: research in reverse. Lancet. 2002 Feb 2;359:431-4. Epidemiologists benefit greatly from having cas e-control study designs in their research armamentarium. Case-control studies can yield impor tant scientific findings with relatively little time, money, and effort compared with other study designs. This seemingly quick road to research results entices many newly trained epid emiologists. Indeed, investigators implement 171case-control studies more frequently than any other analytical epidem iological study. Unfortunately, case-control designs also tend to be more susceptible to biases than other comparative studies. Although easier to do, they ar e also easier to do wrong. Five main notions guide investigators who do, or read ers who assess, case-control studi es. First, investigators must explicitly define the criteria for diagnosis of a case and any eligibil ity criteria used for selection. Second, controls should come from the same population as the cases, and their selection should be independent of the exposures of interest. Th ird, investigators should b lind the data gatherers to the case or control status of participants or , if impossible, at least blind them to the main hypothesis of the study. Fourth, data gatherers need to be thoroughly trained to elicit exposure in a similar manner from cases and controls; they sh ould use memory aids to facilitate and balance recall between cases and controls . Finally, investigators should address confounding in casecontrol studies, either in the design st age or with analytical tec hniques. Devotion of meticulous attention to these points enhances the validity of the results and bolsters the reader's confidence in the findings. REVIEW Cohort Studies: Grimes DA, Schulz KF Cohort studies: marching towards outcomes. Lancet. 2002 Jan 26;359:341-5. A cohort study tracks two or more groups forward fr om exposure to outcom e. This type of study can be done by going ahead in time from the presen t (prospective cohort study) or, alternatively, by going back in time to comprise the c ohorts and following them up to the present (retrospective cohort study). A cohort study is the best way to identify incidence and natural history of a disease, and can be used to ex amine multiple outcomes after a single exposure. However, this type of study is less useful for exam ination of rare events or those that take a long time to develop. A cohort study should provide specific definitions of exposures and outcomes: determination of both should be as objective as possible. The control group (unexposed) should be similar in all important respects to the expos ed, with the exception of not having the exposure. Observational studies, however, rarely achieve such a degree of similarity, so investigators need to measure and control for confounding factors. Reduction of loss to follow-up over time is a challenge, since differential losses to follow-up introduce bias. Variations on the cohort theme include the before-after study and nested case-control study (within a cohort study). Strengths of a cohort study include the ability to calculate incidence rates, re lative risks, and 95% CIs. This format is the preferred way of presenting study results, rather that with p values.

Although medical training often provides physicians with a general backgro und in biostatistics, many are not prepared to apply these skills.

REVIEW: Katz MH Multivariable analysis: a primer for readers of medical research. Ann Intern Med. 2003 Apr 15;138(8):644-50 Many clinical readers, especi ally those uncomfortable with mathematics, treat published multivariable models as a black box, accepting the aut hor's explanation of the results. However, multivariable analysis can be understood without undue concern for the underlying mathematics. This paper reviews the basics of multivariable an alysis, including what multivariable models are, why they are used, what types exist, what assumptions underlie them, how they should be interpreted, and how they can be evaluated. A deeper understanding of multivariable models enables readers to decide for th emselves how much weight to gi ve to the results of published analyses REVIEW: Grimes DA, Schultz KF Uses and abuses of screening tests. Lancet. 2002 Mar 9;359(9309):881-4 Screening tests are ubiquitous in contemporary practice, yet the principles of screening are widely misunderstood. Screening is the testing of apparently well people to find those at increased risk of having a disease or disord er. Although an earlier di agnosis generally has intuitive appeal, earlier might not always be better, or worth th e cost. Four terms describe the validity of a screening test: sensitivity, specifi city, and predictive value of positive and negative results. For tests with continuous variables--e g, blood glucose--sensitivi ty and specificity are inversely related; where the cuto ff for abnormal is placed should i ndicate the clinic al effect of wrong results. The prevalence of disease in a popul ation affects screening test performance: in 173low-prevalence settings, even very good tests h ave poor predictive value positives. Hence, knowledge of the approximate prevalence of diseas e is a prerequisite to interpreting screening test results. Tests are often done in sequence, as is true for syphilis and HIV-1 infection. Leadtime and length biases distort the apparent va lue of screening programmes; randomised controlled trials are the only way to avoid these biases. Scre ening can improve health; strong indirect evidence links cervical cytology programmes to declines in cervical cancer mortality. However, inappropriate application or interpreta tion of screening tests can rob people of their perceived health, initiate ha rmful diagnostic testing, and s quander health-care resources. REVIEW: Grimes DA, Schutz KF Bias and causal associations in observational research. Lancet. 2002 Jan 19;359:248-52. Readers of medical literature need to consider two types of validity, internal and external. Internal validity means that the study measured what it set out to; external validi ty is the ability to generalise from the study to the reader's patients. With respect to internal validity, selection bias, information bias, and confounding are present to some degree in all observational research. Selection bias stems from an absence of compar ability between groups being studied. Information bias results from incorrect determination of expo sure, outcome, or both. The effect of information bias depends on its type. If information is gathered differently for one group than for another, bias results. By contrast, non-differential misclassi fication tends to obscu re real differences. Confounding is a mixing or blurring of effects: a researcher attempts to relate an exposure to an outcome but actually measures the effect of a th ird factor (the confoundi ng variable). Confounding can be controlled in several ways: restriction, matching, stratification, and more sophisticated multivariate techniques. If a reader cannot explain away study results on the basis of selection, information, or confounding bias, then chance might be another explanation. Chance should be examined last, however, since these biases can account for highly significant, though bogus results. Differentiation between spurious, indirect, and causal associations can be difficult. Criteria such as temporal sequence, strength and consis tency of an association, and evidence of a dose- response effect lend support to a causal link. REVIEW: Schulz KF, Grimes DA Multiplicity in 2005;365:1591-1595 Multiplicity problems emerge from investig ators looking at many additional endpoints and treatment group comparisons. Thousands of potentia l comparisons can emanate from one trial. Investigators might only report the significant co mparisons, an unscientific practice if unwitting, and fraudulent if intentional. Researchers must report all the endpoints an alysed and treatments compared. Some statisticians propose statistical adjustments to account for multiplicity. Simply defined, they test for no effects in all the primary endpoints undertaken versus an effect in one or more of those endpoints. In general, statistical adjustments for multiplicity provide crude answers to an irrelevant question. However, investig ators should use adjustments when the clinical decision-making argument rests solely on one or more of the prim ary endpoints being significant. In these cases, adjustments somewhat rescue scattershot analyses. Readers need to be aware of the potential for under-reporting of analyses. 174 REVIEW: Schulz KF, Grimes DA Multiplic ity in randomised trials II: subgroup and interim analyses The Lancet 2005;365:1657-1661. Subgroup analyses can pose serious multiplicity concerns. By testing enough subgroups, a falsepositive result will probably emerge by chance alone. Investigators might undertake many analyses but only report the signif icant effects, distorting the medi cal literature. In general, we discourage subgroup analyses. However, if they are necessary, researchers should do statistical tests of interaction, ra ther than analyse every separate subgroup. Investig ators cannot avoid interim analyses when data monitoring is indicate d. However, repeatedly te sting at every interim raises multiplicity concerns, and not accounting for multiplicity escalates the false-positive error. Statistical stopping methods must be used. Th e O'Brien-Fleming and Peto group sequential stopping methods are easily implemented and preser ve the intended alpha level and power. Both adopt stringent criteria (low nominal p values) during the in terim analyses. Implementing a trial under these stopping rules resemble s a conventional trial, with the exception that it can be terminated early should a treatment prove greatl y superior. Investigator s and readers, however, need to grasp that the estimated treatment effects are prone to exaggeration, a random high, with early stopping. D. Epidemiology (Also see IV.B for experimental designs) REVIEW: Grimes DA, Schultz KF Compared to what? Finding controls for case-control studies. Lancet 2005;365:1429-1433 Use of control (comparison) groups is a powerful research tool. In case-co ntrol studies, controls estimate the frequency of an exposure in the population under study. Controls can be taken from known or unknown study populations. A known group c onsists of a defined population observed over a period, such as passengers on a cruise ship. When the study group is known, a sample of the population can be used as controls. If no popul ation roster exists, then techniques such as random-digit dialling can be used. Sometim es, however, the study group is unknown, for example, motor-vehicle crash vi ctims brought to an emergency de partment, who may come from far away. In this situation, hospital controls, neighbourhood contro ls, and friend, associate, or relative controls can be used. In general, one we ll-selected control group is better than two or more. When the number of cases is small, the ratio of controls to cases can be raised to improve the ability to find important differences. Although no ideal control group ex ists, readers need to think carefully about how representa tive the controls are. Poor choice of controls can lead to both wrong results and possible medical harm.

REVIEW: Grimes DA, Schultz KF An overview of clinical research: the lay of the land Lancet 2002;359:57-61 Many clinicians report that they cannot read the medical literature critic ally. To address this difficulty, we provide a primer of clinical research for clinicians and researchers alike. Clinical research falls into two general categories: expe rimental and observational, based on whether the investigator assigns the exposures or not. Experimental trials can also be subdivided into two: randomised and non-randomised. Observational studies can be either analy tical or descriptive. Analytical studies feature a comparison (contro l) group, whereas descriptive studies do not. Within analytical studies, cohort studies track people forward in time from exposure to outcome. By contrast, case-control studies work in reverse, tracing back from outcome to exposure. Crosssectional studies are like a snapshot, which measures both exposure and outcome at one time point. Descriptive studies, such as case-series reports, do not have a comparison group. Thus, in this type of study, investigators cannot examine a ssociations, a fact often forgotten or ignored. Measures of association, such as relative risk or odds ratio, ar e the preferred way of expressing results of dichotomous outcomes-eg, sick vers us healthy. Confidence intervals around these measures indicate the precision of these results . Measures of association with confidence intervals reveal the strength, direction, and a plausible range of an effect as well as the likelihood of chance occurrence. By contrast, p values ad dress only chance. Testi ng null hypotheses at a p value of 0.05 has no basis in medicine and should be discouraged.

Arch Intern Med. 2004;164:2201-4 To ensure that research subjects provide vali d consent, most commentators direct clinical 176investigators to formally assess potential subjects who are at increased risk for lacking the capacity to consent. Current data reveal, however, that subjects with no known cognitive impairments often fail to give valid consent. These data imply th at the prevailing focus on individuals' capacity to consent is too narrow. To protect subjects, as well as the integrity of clinical research, the actual consent of all subjects should be formally assessed. Recent development of several preliminary consent assessment tools suggests that, in addition to being ethically pref erable, with additional research this approach may be practically feasible. Future rese arch should focus on developing a postdecision questionnaire that can be adapted to individual studies and used to assess the voluntariness and understanding of all research subjects. F. Adverse Event Reporting REVIEW: Morse MA, Califf RM, Sugarman J. Monitoring and ensuring safety during clinical research JAMA 2001;285:1201-5 Increased numbers of clinical trials, many of which are large, multicenter, and sometimes international, and the marked shift of funding for clinical trials to indus try have made apparent the inadequacy of mechanisms fo r protecting human subjects that were developed when clinical research was generally carried out on a small scale at single institutions. To address concerns regarding the protection of human subjects, a group of professiona ls with expertise in various aspects of clinical trials was assembled in Ma y 2000. Participants described and evaluated the mechanisms by which clinical trials are monito red, focusing on adverse event reporting and the processes by which various parties with oversight responsibilities interact in the course of these trials. In this article, we de scribe the manner in which advers e event reporting might function to enhance safety and the role of data monitoring committees in using aggregate data from these reports, outline the problems that now exist for in stitutional review boards as they are faced with multiple adverse event reports from clinical tria ls while conducting continuing review, and offer recommendations for improving the current approach. G. Grant Writing REVIEW: Inouye SK, Fiellin DA. An evidence-based guide to writing gr ant proposals for clinical research Ann Intern Med. 2005;142:274-82 The competition for funds to conduct clinical rese arch is intense, and only a minority of grant proposals receive funding. In part icular, funding for patient-oriente d research lags behind that allocated for basic science resear ch. Grant writing is a skill of fundamental importance to the clinical researcher, and conducting high-quality clin ical research requires funds received through successful grant proposals. This article provides recommendations for the grant-writing process for clinical researchers. On the basis of obser vations from a National Institutes of Health study section, we describe types and sources of grant funds, provide key recommendations regarding the process of grant writing, and hi ghlight the sections of grants that are frequently scrutinized and critiqued. We also provide specific recommendations to he lp grant writers improve the quality of areas commonly cited as deficient. Ap plication of this systematic approach will make the task more manageable for anyone who writes grants. 177 V . Clinical Sciences The subspecialty of allergy and immunology encomp asses three major clini cal areas: allergic diseases and asthma, immunoregulatory disorders, and immunodeficiency diseases. It is the intention of allergy and immunology training programs to train resi dents as expert consultants and accomplished practitioners in these areas. Mo reover, the scholastic approaches to maintain understanding of recent advances and current co ncepts of the specialty over a professional lifetime must be in instilled during the traini ng program. The following is an outline of the diseases about which allergy and immunology fello ws must be knowledgeable. Training programs may vary their emphasis on the basis of mission, expert ise, and resources. It is expected that all residents be trained in the phys iology, pathology, differential di agnosis, and treatment of such diseases with understanding of the use therap eutic modalities including mechanisms of action, dosing, adverse effects, and costs of therapy. E xplicit instruction should also be given on the importance of behavioral studies and bioethics in re gard to clinical trials and appropriate use of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. A. Allergic Diseases and Related Disorders 1. Upper airway disease a. Rhinitis, sinusitis, nasal polyposis, otit is (bacterial Allergic and Nonallergic Rhinitis REVIEW: Sarin S The role of the nervou system in rhinitis J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2006 Nov;118(5):999-1016 The nose provides defensive and homeostatic functi ons requiring rapid res ponses to physical and chem ical stimuli. As a result, it is armed with a complex nervous system that includes sensory, parasympathetic, and sympathetic nerves. Sensor y nerves transmit signals from the mucosa, generating sensations, such as pruritus; motor reflexes, such as sneezing; and parasympathetic and sympathetic reflexes that affect the glandular and vascular nasal a pparatuses. Reflexes directed to the nose are also generated by inputs from other body regions. Hence all symptoms that constitute the nosologic entity of rhinitis can be trigge red through neural pathways. In addition, neural signals generated in the nose can influence distal physiology, such as that of the bronchial tree and the cardiovascular system. Neur al function can be chronically upregulated in the presence of mucosal inflammation, acutely with an allergic r eaction, or even in the absence of inflammation, as in cases of nonallergic rhini tis. Upregulation of the nasal ner vous system can occur at various levels of the reflex pathways, resulting in exa ggerated responses (neural hyperresponsiveness), as well as in increased capacity for generation of neurogenic inflammation, a phenomenon that depends on the release of neuropeptides on antidr omic stimulation of nociceptive sensory nerves. The molecular mechanisms of hyperresponsiveness are not understood, but several inflammatory products appear to be playing a role. Neurotrophin s, such as the nerve growth factor, are prime 178candidates as mediators of neural hyperrespon siveness. The many interactions between the nervous and immune systems contribute to nasal physiology but also to nasal disease. REVIEW: Saleh HA. Perennial rhinitis. BMJ.2007;335:502-7 Perennial rhinitis can be defined clinically as an inflammatory condition of the nose characterised by nasal obstruction, sneezing, itchin g, or rhinorrhoea, occurring for an hour or more on most days throughout the year. Rhinitis is commonly ma naged by both primary and secondary care physicians. Although most cases can be diagnosed and treated in primary care, referral to secondary care is often necessary when patients do not respond to treatment or other diagnoses are suspected. REVIEW: Berger WE Nonallergic rhinitis in children Curr Allergy Asthma Rep 2007;7:112-6 Nonallergic rhinitis in children is a medical condition that has not been well defined and the true incidence is unknown. Current treatme nt recommendations are based on data obtained from adult studies. The mechanisms of pedi atric nonallergic rhinitis are al so unclear. The concept that laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) events may play a critical role in the path ogenesis of upper airway disease is presently under inves tigation. Although LPR is being bette r delineated and appropriate methods of diagnosis and treatment are being studied, substantial evidence links LPR with several disease states including rhinitis, sinus disease, and middle ear disease. Due to the lack of information concerning the etiology of nonallergic rhinitis in children, LP R should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child with nega tive skin tests and chronic rhinitis symptoms. The clinician should especially give at tention to this diagnosis when a child presents with recurrent co- morbid conditions such as chronic sinus itis or persistent middle ear disease. REVIEW: Schubert MS Allergic Fungal Sinusitis Clin Rev in Allergy Immunol 2006 ;30:205-16 Many chronic inflammatory rhinosinusitis conditio ns (hypertrophic sinus disease [HSD]) have the histopathological profile of allergic or asthmatic inflammation. Allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) is both a type of and a type of HSD. AFS has clinicopathological features that make it similar, but not identical, to al lergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Allergic mucin is (EMRS).\" Diagnosis of AFS requires a careful review of surgical reports, histopathology, and culture results. Treatment includes surgery and aggressive postoperative medical ma nagement of allergic inflamma tory disease. Prognosis is good with integrated medical-surgica l follow-up, but recurrence remains problematic. The association of ABPA, AFS, and HSD with class II genes of the major histocompatibility complex places the initiation of these inflammatory diseases with in the context of antigen presentation and the acquired immune response. Pathological immunoman ipulation of this response by local microbial 179superantigens may be a comm on mechanism for disease pathogenesis. Future research into the molecular biology of these related conditions may offer insight into the pathogenesis of other chronic inflammatory diseases. REVIEW: Prenner BM Allergic rhinitis: treatment based on patient profiles. Am J Med 2006;119:230-7 Allergic rhinitis is a common medical condition char and ocular itching; rhinorrhea; sneezing; nasal and, less frequently, cough. The treatment of allergic rhinitis should control these symptoms without adversely aff ecting daily activities or cognitive performance and should prevent sequelae such as asthma exacerbation or sinusitis. This review describes a stepwise approach to treatment of allerg ic rhinitis derived from a synthesis of clinical trial results, patient preferences , and real-world tolera bility data. Key clinical considerations include frequency and intensity of symptoms, patient age, comorbidities, compliance with treatment regimens (influenced by formulation, route and frequency of administration), and effects on quality of life. Oral second- generation antihistamines, versus first-generation agents and inhaled corticosteroids, should be considered first- line treatment because they provide rapid relief of most allergic rhinitis symptoms without safety and tolerability issues. Additional therapeutic agents can then be added or substitute d based on individual symptom response. REVIEW: Passalacqua G Rhinitis, rhinosinusitis and Pediatr 2007;18:40-5. Quality of life (QoL) or, rather, health-related QoL, is currently regarded as a crucial aspect of the general well-being of patients and, in consequence, of the effects of a disease and its treatment. This is particularly true for re spiratory allergy (asthma and rhinit is), which are chronic diseases and also for sinusitis (rhinosinusi tis). A number of questionnaires (i nstruments), either generic or specific, have been developed and validated to assess the QoL in adults and children, for asthma and rhinitis, whereas there are few specific instru ments for chronic rhinos inusitis. The literature provides strong evidence of the effects of allergic rhinitis, asthma and th eir treatments on QoL in paediatric patients, as well as in adults, whereas the number of experimental data on rhinosinusitis is limited, especially in children. Clinical trials evidenced some controversial points, mainly the weak correlation existing between QoL and traditional objective parameters. It has become clear that the QoL questionnaires measure the aspects of the disease that partially differ from the routinely evaluated parameters and that QoL should integrate, not replace, the objective measurements. REVIEW: Nathan RA. The burden of allergic rhinitis. Allergy Asthma Proceed 2007; 28:3-9 Although formerly regarded as a nuisance disease, al lergic rhinitis (AR) ha s a considerable effect on quality of life and can have significant consequences if left untr eated. The total burden of this disease lies not only in impaire d physical and social functioning but also in a financial burden 180made greater when considering ev idence that AR is a possible causal factor in comorbid diseases such as asthma or sinusitis. Compared with matched controls, patients with AR have an approximate twofold increase in medication costs and 1.8-fold the number of visits to health practitioners. Hidden direct costs include the treatment of comorbid asthma, chronic sinusitis, otitis media, upper respiratory infection, and nasal po lyposis. Nasal congestion, the most prominent symptom in AR, is associated with sleep-disor dered breathing, a condition that can have a profound effect on mental health, including increase d psychiatric disorders, depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse. Furthermore, sleep-diso rdered breathing in childhood and adolescence is associated with increased disorders of learning performance, behavior, and attention. In the United States, AR results in 3.5 million lost workdays and 2 million lost schooldays annually. Patients struggle to alleviate their miser y, frequently self-adjusting their treatment regimen of over-the- counter and prescription medications because of lack of efficacy, deterioration of efficacy, lack of 24-hour relief, and bothersome side effects. Ironi cally, health care providers overestimate patient satisfaction with therapy. Therefore, improve ment in patient-practit ioner communication may enhance patient adherence w ith prescribed regimens. REVIEW: Greiner AN Pharmacologic rationale for J Allergy nnial nonallergic rhini tis (PNAR) represent conditions affecting millions of individuals across the world. Although the diagnosis of AR might be presumptively based on the types of symptoms and the history of allergen triggers, confirmation requires documentation of specific IgE reactivity. In c ontrast, PNAR is a condition with similar symptomatology but in which the pa tient has no identifiable specifi c allergic sensitivities. This review presents the diverse options of currently available pharmacologic agents for the treatment of AR and are described for the various forms of rhinitis. REVIEW: Nelson H. Advances in upper airway diseases and allergen immunotherapy. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2007;119:872-80 The purpose of this review is to highlight im portant articles on upper airway diseases and immunotherapy that appeared du ring 2006. Studies from Europe continue to examine the usefulness of the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma classification of allergic rhinitis as intermittent or persistent and its levels of severity as mild or moderate/severe. A number of physical agents were shown to effect nasal inflammation: sudden temperature changes in patients with allergic rhinitis increased eosinophilic inflammation; in children with allergic asthma, the personal exposure to particles <2.5 microm ai r pollution correlated with percent of nasal eosinophils and levels of markers of nasal exudation; and in patie nts who developed rhinorrhea on exposure to cold and windy weather, nasal challe nge with cold dry air caused sloughing of nasal epithelial cells. A 3-month double-blind, placebo-controlled study of nasal washes with amphoteracin B showed no benefit in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Studies of 181immunotherapy with grass and dog dander extracts confirmed the need for doses containing 15 to 20 m icrog of the major allergen for optimal effec tiveness. The protective effect of immunotherapy on the development of asthma in children with alle rgic rhinitis was shown to still be present 2 years after completion of a 3-year course of treatment. Injection immunotherapy with a moderate dose of house dust mite extract in house dust-se nsitive adults with atopic dermatitis reduced symptoms and use of corticosteroids and antihis tamines compared with treatment with about 1/1000 of that dose of the same extract. Pretreatment for 9 weeks with the monoclonal anti-IgE antibody omalizumab reduced systemic reactions during rush immunotherapy 5-fold and allowed further build-up at weekly intervals without systemic reactions. A review of sublingual immunotherapy confirmed both efficacy and safet y, but evidence for appropriate dosing and for the effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy employing multiple allergen mixes was still lacking. Two studies with a sublingual grass polle n extract tablet showed a clear dose response and the ability to initiate subli ngual immunotherapy without an up-dosing phase. A pilot study cytosine phosphorothionate quanosine DNA conjugated to the major allergen of ragweed reported impressive improvement in symptoms the firs t pollen season that pers isted during the second pollen season without any further administration of the conjugate. In conclusion, studies on rhinitis and sinusitis explored the pat hophysiology of the disease more than offering new therapeutic approaches. Studies on immunothera py addressed optimal dosing, but also a variety of safer and more convenient approaches such as reduction of IgE with omalizumab, conjugating allergen to immunostimulatory 2007;119:780-791 Allergen-specific immunotherapy (S IT) has been used for almost a century as a desensitizing therapy for allergic diseases and represents the only curative and specific method of treatment. Administration of appropriate c oncentrations of allergen extr acts has been shown to be reproducibly effective when pati ents are carefully selected. Th e mechanisms by which allergen- SIT has its effects include the modulation of T-cell and B-cel l responses and related antibody isotypes as well as effector cells of allergic inflammation, such as eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells. The balance between allergen-specific T-re gulatory (Treg) and TH2 cells appears to be decisive in the development of allergic and healt hy immune responses agains t allergens. Treg cells consistently represent the domin ant subset specific for commo n environmental allergens in sensitized healthy individuals. In contrast, there is a high frequenc y of allergen-specific TH2 cells in patients with allergy. The induction of a tole rant state in peripheral T cells represents an essential step in allergen-SIT. Peripheral T-cell tolerance is characterized mainly by generation of allergen-specific Treg cells leading to suppresse d T-cell proliferation and TH1 and TH2 cytokine responses against the allergen. This is accompanied by a significan t increase in allergen-specific IgG4, and also IgG1 and IgA, and a decrease in Ig E in the late stage of the disease. In addition, decreased tissue infiltration of mast cells and eosinophils and their mediator release including circulating basophils takes pl ace. Current understanding of mechanisms of allergen-SIT, particularly the role of Treg ce lls in peripheral tolera nce, may enable novel treatment strategies. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Creticos PS 182Immunotherapy with a ragw eed-toll-like offers a new approach to allergen im munotherapy that reduces acute a llergic responses. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of a vaccine consisting of Amb a 1, a ragweed-pollen antigen, conjugated to a phosphorothioate ol igodeoxyribonucleotide immunostimulatory sequence of DNA (AIC) in 25 a dults who were allergic to ragweed. Patients received six weekly injections of the AIC or placebo vaccine before the first ragweed season and were monitored during the next two ragweed seasons. RESULTS: There was no pattern of vaccine-associated systemic reactions or clinic ally significant laboratory abnormalities. AIC did not alter the primary end point, the vascular permeabil ity response (measured by the albumin level in nasal-lavage fluid) to na sal provocation. During the first ragweed season, the AIC group had better peak-season rhinitis scores on the visual-analogue scale (P=0.006), peak-season diary scores (P=0.02), and midseason overall quality-of-life scores (P=0.05) than the placebo group. AIC induced a transient increase in Amb a 1-specific IgG antibody but suppressed the seasonal increase in Amb a 1-specific IgE an tibody. A reduction in the number of interleukin- 4-positive visual-analogue scores (r=0.49, P=0.03). Clinical benefits of AIC were ag ain observed in the subsequent ragweed season, with improvements over placebo in peak-season rhinit is visual-analogue scores (P=0.02) and peak- season daily nasal symptom diary scores (P=0.02). The seasonal specific IgE antibody response was again suppressed, with no significant change in IgE antibody titer during the ragweed season (P=0.19). CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, a 6-week regimen of the AIC vaccine appeared to offer long-term clinical efficacy in the treatment of ragweed allergic rhinitis. REVIEW: Nelson H Allergen now? J Allergy Clin Immunol 2007;119:769-79 The scientific basis and the proof of clinical effectiven ess of allergen immunotherapy administered by subcutaneous injection (SCIT) are well establis hed. It is effective treatment for sensitivity to Hymenoptera venom and for allergic rhinitis and a llergic asthma. SCIT admi nistered in the proper setting reduces the development of new sensitiv ities and progression from rhinitis to asthma. Further, the beneficial effect s persist long after completion of a course of treatment. Although many people enjoy the benefits of SCIT, extensi on of its use to the many others who might be candidates for this treatment is limited by its draw backs of safety concerns and the inconvenience of repeated clinic visits over several years to receive the inj ections. There are many attempts underway to improve on the safety and convenience while still retaining the benefits of SCIT. These include approaches using current allergen extracts, especially by administering them sublingually. Alternatively, through recombinant technology, extracts are being modified to reduce their allergenicity without reducing their immunogenicity. They are being linked to immunostimulatory DNA sequences that will modify their in vivo processing resulting in an enhanced nonallergic response or they are being incorporated into fusion proteins with inhibitory properties for mast cells and basophils. REVIEW: Cox LS. 183Sublingual immunotherapy: Clin Immunol 2006;117:1021-35 Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has been used w ith increasing frequency in Europe and is viewed with incre asing interest by allergists in th e United States. To address this interest, a Joint Task Force of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology's Immunotherapy and Allergy Diagnostic Committees reviewed the available literature on SLIT and prepared this report. The task force concluded that despite clear eviden ce that SLIT is an effective treatment, many questions remained unanswered, including effective dose, treatment schedules, and overall duration of treatment. Until these have been determined, an assessment of the cost/benefit ratio of the treatment cannot be made. SLIT does appear to be associated with few serious side effect s, but it has not been administered in high-risk asthmatic patients, nor in the studies reviewed has it been administered as a mixture of non-cross-reacting allergens. Furt hermore, there is curr ently no allergy extract approved for this use in the United States, nor is there a Current Procedural Terminology code for billing purposes. All of these factors shoul d be given careful c onsideration by anyone contemplating initiating SLIT treatm ent for their allergic patients. PRACTICE PARAMETER / GUIDELINE: Allergen immunotherapy: a practice parameter second update Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters ; J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2007;120:S25-85. The objective of \"Allergen immunotherapy: a practice parameter\" is to improve the practice of allergen im munotherapy for patients with allerg ic rhinitis, allergic asthma, and Hymenoptera sensitivity. This parameter is in tended to increase the appropriat e use of allergen immunotherapy; reduce the underuse, overuse, and mi suse of allergen immunotherapy; and establish guidelines for the safe and effective use of allergen imm unotherapy, while reducing unwanted and unneeded variation in immunotherapy practice ii. Sinusitis and Rhinosinusitis REVIEW: Brooke I Acute and chronic bacterial sinusitis. Infect Dis Clin North Am. 2007;21:427-48 Sinusitis is one of the most common complaints resulting in physician visits in the United States. An antecedent viral infection of the upper resp iratory tract is the most common presentation. Despite its prevalence, most cases resolve s pontaneously. Only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection that will benefit from antimicrobial ther apy. This article discusses the microbiology and pathogenesis of acute and chr onic bacterial sinusitis . The role anaerobic bacterial in chronic and recurrent sinusitis is emphasized, and appropriate antimicrobial regimens are discussed. Pediatr 2005;44:465-71 184Clinical pra ctice guidelines for th e management of acute sinusitis in children have been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Of note is that in this document, a brief discussion of chronic disease concluded that the pathogenesis and management are essentially unknown. Although there are insufficient data in the literature to develop ev idence-based clinical guidelines, a careful review of the literature and clinical experience of expe rts who manage pediatric chronic sinusitis is presented in an effort to develop specific recommendations and to offer practical treatment options. Factors associat ed with chronic sinusitis shoul d be addressed individually and include recurrent viral upper re spiratory infections, allergic sinusitis also includes Staphylococcus aureus, anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. Medical interventions disc ussed include endoscopic sinus surgery, saline nasal irrigation, in tranasal decongestant therapy, intranasal steroids, and oral antibiotics. Clinical ranking without regard to side effects and co st suggests that endoscopic sinus surgery and antral irrigation have the highest probability of substantial symptom improvement. Other issues discussed include id entification and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), allergy, and immune deficiency. REVIEW: Piccirillo, gies and Evidence; Diagnosis and Therapy; Uncomplicated Sinusitis; Complicated or Severe Sinusitis; Patients with Allergic Rhinitis; Areas of Uncertainty; Guidelines; Conclusions and Recommendations REVIEW: Bhattacharyya N. Progress in management of chro nic and nasal polyposis. Curr Allergy Asthma Rep. 2007;7:216-20. Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) re mains the treatment of choice fo r medically refractory chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with or without nasa l polyposis (NP). ESS has undergone review, reassessment, and substantial refinement. Severa l advances (eg, powered instrumentation, image guidance, adjunctive intraopera tive procedures) have expanded the scope of cases amenable to ESS, decreased operative time and intraoperative blood loss, and improved safety. Procoagulant nasal/sinus packing and refineme nts of technique have decreased the need for postoperative removal of packing, thus decreasing morbidity. Methods to reduce synechia formation (ie, mitomycin-c) have been explored, with mixed results. Novel methods of sinusotomy (eg, balloon catheter dilatation of the sinus ostia) have had limited but inte resting short-term results. We can expect further advances in ESS with better pati ent outcomes. However, continued elucidation of the underlying pathophysiology of CRS and NP are essential to long-term improvement. REVIEW: Small CB Judicious antibiotic use and intranasal corticosteroids in acute rhinosinusitis. Am J Med. 2007;120:289-94. 185Most patients with symptoms of acute rhinosinus itis are treated with antibiotics. However, many cases of rhinosinusitis are seconda ry to viral infections and unlik ely to benefit from antibiotic therapy. Inappropriate use of an tibiotics in patients with ac ute nonbacterial rhinosinusitis contributes to the increase in bacterial antibiot ic resistance. Consequently, safe and effective alternatives to antibiotics are needed in the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral infections. Recent results from controlled trials have shown that intranasal corticosteroids, used in combination with antibiotics or as monotherapy in selected cases, provide significant symptom relief and resolution of acute rh inosinusitis. The use of intranasal corticosteroids in acute rhinosinusitis therefore might reduce the inappr opriate use of antimicrobial therapy in acute rhinosinusitis. KEY CLINICAL PUBLICATION: Williamson IG Antibiotics and Topical Nasal Steroid for Treatment of Acute Maxillary Sinusitis: A Randomized Controlled Trial JAMA. 2007;298(21):2487-2496 CONTEXT: Acute sinusitis is a common clinical problem that usually results in a prescription for antibiotics but the role of antibiotics is debated. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as topical steroids may be beneficial but are underresearched. OBJE CTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of amoxicillin and budesonide in acute randomized, placebo-cont rolled factorial trial of 240 adults (aged 16 years) with acute nonrecurrent sinusitis (had 2 diagnostic criteria: pur ulent rhinorrhea local pain with unilatera l predominance, purulent rhinorrhea bilateral, presence of pus in the nasal cavity) at 58 fa mily practices (74 family physicians) between November 2001 and November 2005. Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups: antibiotic and nasal steroid; placebo antibiotic antibi otic and placebo nasal steroid; placebo antibiotic and placebo nasa l steroid. INTERVENTION: A dose of 500 mg of amoxicillin 3 times per day for 7 days and 200 \u00b5g of budesonide in each nostril once per day for 10 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion clinically cured at day 10 using patient symptom diaries and the duration and severity of symptoms. RESULTS: The proportions of patients with symptoms lasting 10 or more days were 29 of 100 (29%) for amoxicillin vs 36 of 107 (33.6%) for no amoxicillin (adjusted odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence in terval, 0.57-1.73). The proportions of patients with symptoms lasting 10 or more days were 32 of 102 (31.4%) for topical budesonide vs 33 of 105 (31.4%) for no budesonide (adjusted odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-1.62). Secondary analysis suggested that nasal steroids we re significantly more effective in patients with less severe symptoms at baseline. CONCLUSION : Neither an antibiotic nor a topical steroid alone or in combination was e ffective as a treatment for acute sinusitis in the primary care setting. REVIEW: Harvey R Nasal saline irrigations for the symptoms of rhinosinusitis. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2007 Jul 18;(3):CD006394 BACKGROUND: The u se of nasal irrigation for the treatment of nose and sinus complaints has its foundations in yogic and homeopath ic traditions. There has been increasing use of saline irrigation, douches, sprays and rinsing as an adjunct to the medical management of chronic 186rhinosinusitis. Treatment strategies often include th e use of topical saline from once to more than four times a day. Considerable patient effort is often involved. Any additional benefit has been difficult to discern from other treatments. OBJECT IVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical saline in the management of chroni c rhinosinusitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: Our search included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Re gister, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlle d Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4 2006), MEDLINE (1950 to 2006) and EMBASE (1974 to 2006). The date of the last search was November 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials in which saline was evaluated in comparison with eith er no treatment, a placebo, as an adjunct to othe r treatments or against treatments. The comparis on of hypertonic versus isotonic solutions was also compared. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trials were graded for methodologi cal quality using the Cochrane approach (modification of Chalmers 1990). Only symptom scores from saline versus no treatment and symptom and radiological scores from the hypertonic versus isotonic group could be pooled for statistical analysis . A narrative overview of the rema ining results is presented. MAIN RESULTS: Eight trials were identified that satisf ied the inclusion criteria. Three studies compared topical saline agains t no treatment, one against placebo, one as an adjunct to and one against an intranasal steroid spray. Two st udies compared different hypert onic solutions against isotonic saline.There is evidence that saline is beneficial in the treatment of the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis when used as the sole modality of treatment. Evidence also exists in favour of saline as a treatment adjunct. No superiority was seen when saline was compared against a reflexology 'placebo'. Saline is not as effective as an intran asal steroid. Some evidence suggests that hypertonic solutions improve objective measures but the impact on symptoms is less clear. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Saline irrigations are well tolera ted. Although minor side effects are common, the beneficial effect of saline appears to outweig h these drawbacks for the majority of patients. The use of topical saline could be included as a treatment adjunc t for the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis.

Nasal Polyposis REVIEW: Fokkens W 187European position paper polyps 2007 Rhinology - Supplement 2007;20:1-136 Rhinosinusitis is a significant a nd increasing health problem whic h results in a large financial burden on society. This evidence based posit ion paper describes what is known about rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps, offers evid ence based recommendations on diagnosis and treatment, and considers how we can make progr ess with research in this area. Rhinitis and sinusitis usually coexist and are concurrent in most individuals; thus, the correct terminology is now rhinosinusitis. Rhinosinusitis (including nasal polyps) is defi ned as inflammation of the nose and the paranasal sinuses characterised by two or more symptoms, one of which should be either nasal blockage/obstruction/congestio n or or loss of smell; and either endoscopic signs of polyps and/or mucopurulent discharge primar ily from middle meatus and/or ; oedema/mucosal obstruction primarily in middle meatus, and/or CT changes showing mucosal changes within the ostiomeatal complex and/or sinuses. The paper gives differe nt definitions for epid emiology, first line and second line treatment and for research. Furt hermore the paper describes the anatomy and (patho)physiology, epidemiology and predisposing f actors, inflammatory mechanisms, evidence based diagnosis, medical and surgical treatment in acute and chronic rh inosinusitis and nasal polyposis in adults and children. Evidence based sc hemes for diagnosis and treatment are given for the first and second line clinicians. Moreover at tention is given to complications and socio- economic cost of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasa l polyps. Last but not l east the relation to the lower airways is discussed. REVIEW: Rinnia AB Nasal polyposis: a cellular-based approach to answering questions. Allergy 2007; 62:348-58 This review aims at discussing some of the difficu lties and pitfalls in NP research, and to identify the important cellular players and interactions in the pathophysiology of NP. We would also like to suggest potential relevant future directions for research. Understanding the pathogenesis of NP may lead to new treatment opt ions for this incapacitating disease. REVIEW: Pawliczak R. Pathogenesis polyps: an The cause of nasal polyp forma tion is still unknown. Genetic pred isposition has been suggested, but there are scanty data to support such theori es. Activated epithelial cells may be the major source of mediators inducing influx of inflammato ry cells (mostly eosino phils) nasal polyp formation. Infec tious agents (including viruses, bacteria, or fungi) may be potential primar y factors activating na sal epithelial cells. Proinflammatory cytokines and grow th factors play important roles in the persistence of mucosal inflammation associated with nasal polyps. Arachi donic acid metabolites seem to be particularly important in the pathogenesis of nasal pol yps in patients with aspirin hypersensitivity rhinosinusitis/asthma syndrome. REVIEW: 188Stenvenson DD Selection of Immunol (AERD) consists of chronic hyperplastic eosinophilic sinusitis and nasal polyposis, asthma, and aspirin hypersensitivity. There are very few patients with AE RD who only have AERD and no other provoking factors. For example, in our series of 300 patients with AERD , two thirds had positiv e wheal-and-flare skin test responses that were fr equently present since childhood. 1 Almost all patients with AERD have complications of infectious rhinit is and sinusitis (viral , bacterial, and fungal). Furthermore, all of the other myriad provoking factors for asthma, su ch as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritant inhalation, and exercise, continue to be active provocateurs. Therefore clinicians need to identify other provoking factors and aggressively treat thes e non-AERD-provoking factors and mechanisms. REVIEW: Bhattacharyya N. Progress in surgical management of chro nic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis. Curr Allergy Asthma Rep. 2007 7:216-20 Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) re mains the treatment of choice fo r medically refractory chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with or without nasa l polyposis (NP). ESS has undergone review, reassessment, and substantial refinement. Severa l advances (eg, powered instrumentation, image guidance, adjunctive intraopera tive procedures) have expanded the scope of cases amenable to ESS, decreased operative time and intraoperative blood loss, and improved safety. Procoagulant nasal/sinus packing and refineme nts of technique have decreased the need for postoperative removal of packing, thus decreasing morbidity. Methods to reduce synechia formation (ie, mitomycin-c) have been explored, with mixed results. Novel methods of sinusotomy (eg, balloon catheter dilatation of the sinus ostia) have had limited but inte resting short-term results. We can expect further advances in ESS with better pati ent outcomes. However, continued elucidation of the underlying pathophysiology of CRS and NP are essential to long-term improvement. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Wang J Involvement of Toll-like receptors in the immune response of na sal polyp epithelial cells. Clin Immunol 2007;124:345-52 Recognition systems employed by airway epithelial cells to respond to microbial exposure include the action of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We investigated the presence and function of TLR2, 3, and 4 in primary cultures of hu man nasal polyp epithelial cells. dsRNA stimulation significantly enhanced the expression and s ecretion of RANTES, IP-10, IL-8, and GM-CSF. LPS also exhibited stimulatory action, but it was much weaker th an dsRNA. Peptidogly can had no significant stimulatory action on the genes. Flow cytometry show ed that the nasal polyp epithelial cell mainly expressed TLR3 in an intracellular compartmen t, but expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was very low on both the cell surface and in the cell. The immune response of primary nasal polyp epithelial cells induced by TLR3 could not be blocke d by anti-TLR3 antibody. Among the TLR ligands evaluated, dsRNA, the ligand for TLR3, mediated the primary nasal polyp epithelial cells. Mar;35:319-26 BACKGROUND: Nasal polyposis (NP) is a chronic inflamma tory disorder of the upper respiratory tract, which is often coexist with asth m a. However, the pathogen esis of especially in patients with NP is still a matter of de bate. OBJECTIVE: To better understand the immunopathologic mechanism involved in this relati onship, we investigated the inflammatory cell profiles in bronchial and nasal ti ssues of patients with NP alone and with concomitant asthma. METHODS: Seventeen patients with NP (six male, 11 female, age range: 19-63, mean age: 38.29+/-13.27 years) were selected for the study. Subjects were di vided into two groups based on the presence of asthma or br onchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR). NP without BHR (Group 1) (n=8), NP and asthma or BHR (Group 2) (n=9). All patients underwent atopy evaluation including detailed history, skin prick test (SPT), total a nd specific IgE determination in sera. None of the subjects had taken inhaled, nasal or oral corticosteroids for at least 1 month before the study. Respiratory symptoms of asthmatic patients were controlled with only shor t acting beta(2)-agonist inhaler drugs as needed. NP tissue, nasal and bronchial mucosa biopsies were taken from eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) expressing cells in specimens were determined by immunohistochemical methods . Positively staining inflammatory cell types were counted. Subepithelial lamina propria and periglandular ar eas were separately evaluated. RESULTS: No significant diffe rence was num bers of CD8(+), CD16(+), bronchial mucosa in all gr oups (P<0.05). However, CD8(+) cells increased in the polyp tiss ue and bronchial mucosa of patients with NP alone when compared with the patients with bo th asthma and NP (P<0.05). CD3(+), CD68(+) and CD16(+) cell counts were tended to be higher within the nasa l polyp tissue of patients with isolated NP compared with counts within nasa l and bronchial mucosa of patients with NP and asthma. Also, patients with isolated NP showed more HLA-DR(+) cells in the nasal polyp tissue and nasal mucosa than those of patients with NP and asthma. Immunoreactivity for EPO(+) eosinophils within the nasal and bronchial mucosa was more prominent in patients with NP and asthma compared with patients with NP alone. The number of EPO(+) eosinophils within the polyp tissue, nasal and bronchial mucosa was higher in the skin prick te st negative (SPT -ve) group than the SPT positive (SPT +ve) ones. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that infiltration of inflammatory cells in the nasal and the lower airways do not remarkably differ between patients with NP alone who has no evid ence of BHR and asthmatic patients with NP. However, patients with SPT-ve NP reveal more intense eosinophilic inflammation in the entire mucosa. iv. Otitis REVIEW: Pelton SI. Otitis media: re-evaluation of the era of antimicrobial resistance, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 52:711-28 190The changing susceptibility of bacterial otopathog ens is only one aspect of the evolving concepts regarding pathogenesis, immunoprophylaxis, phar macodynam ics, and sequelae of acute otitis media that mandates new insights for achieving a successful outcome. 2004 guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics for the treatment of acute otitis media provide one perspective that proposes a rethinking of the routine use of antimicrobial therapy with the hope of preventing further increases in bacterial resistance among otopathogens. The goals of this article are to incorporate the advances in diagnosis, treatmen t, prevention, and management of sequelae into strategies that optimize the outco me of acute otitis media and limit further emergence of resistant otopathogens. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Samuel EA Cytokine regulation of muci n secretion in a human middle ear epithelial model Cytokine 2007 (December 4 e publication ahead of print) Objectives: Middle ear mucins are associated with otitis media (OM), contribute to hearing loss and are regulated by cytokines.

Mucin secretion by chromatography exposed mucin to 100ng/ml at 200ng/ml r IL-1beta. and a dose- and time-dependant manner and these effects can be inhibited by cytokine blockade . Improved understanding of these mechanisms has the potential to alter the appro ach and management of OM a nd lead to novel therapeutic interventions. v. Laryngeal disorders REVIEW: Ford CN Evaluation ma jor cause of laryngeal inflammation and presents with a constellation of symptoms differ ent from classic gastroesophageal reflux disease. OBJECTIVE: To provide a practical approach to evaluating and managing cases of LPR. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed database and the Ovid Database of Systematic reviews were systematically searched for la ryngopharyngeal reflux, laryngopharyngeal reflux fundoplication, laryngopharyngeal reflux PPI tr eatment, and gastroesophageal reflux AND laryngitis. Pertinent subject matter journals and refe rence lists of key research articles were also hand-searched for articles relevant to the an alysis. EVIDENCE SYNTHE SIS: Reflux of gastric contents is a major cause of laryngeal pat hology. The pathophysiology an d symptom complex of 191LPR differs from gastroesophageal reflux disease. Laryngeal pathology results from s mall amounts of refluxate--typically occurring while upright du ring the daytime--causing damage to laryngeal tissues and producing localized symptoms. Unlik e classic gastroesophageal reflux, LPR is not usually associated with esophagitis, heartbur n, or complaints of regurgitation. There is no pathognomonic symptom or finding, but character istic symptoms and laryngoscopic findings provide the basis for validated assessment in struments (the Reflux Sy mptom Index and Reflux Finding Score) useful in initial diagnosis. There are 3 approaches to confirming the diagnosis of LPR: (1) response of symptoms to behavioral and empirical medical tr eatment, (2) endoscopic observation of mucosal injury, and (3) demonstr ation of reflux events by impedance and pH- monitoring studies and barium swallow esophagram . While pH monitoring remains the standard for confirming the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux, the addition of multichannel intraluminal impedance technology improves diagnostic accur acy for describing LPR events. Ambulatory multichannel intraluminal impedance assessment allows for identification of gaseous as well as liquid refluxate and detection of nonacid reflux events that are likely significant in confirming LPR. Although some patients respond to conservati ve behavioral and medical management, as is the case with gastroesophageal re flux, most require more aggre ssive and prolonged treatment to achieve regression of symptoms and laryngeal tissue changes. Su rgical intervention such as laparoscopic fundoplication is useful in select ed recalcitrant cases with laxity of the gastroesophageal sphincter. CONCLUSIONS: Laryngopharyngeal reflux should be suspected when the history and laryngoscopy fi ndings are suggestive of the dia gnosis. Failure to respond to a 3-month trial of behavioral cha nge and gastric acid suppression by adequate doses of proton pump inhibitor medication dictates need for confirmato ry studies. Multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH-monitoring studies are most useful in co nfirming LPR and assessing the magnitude of the problem. REVIEW: Ibrahim WH Paradoxical vocal cord motion diso rder: past, present and future. Postgrad Med J 2007;83:164-72 Paradoxical vocal cord motion disorder (PVCM) , also called vocal cord dysfunction, is an important differential diagnosis for asthma. The di sorder is often misdiagnosed as asthma leading to unnecessary drug use, very high medical utilis ation and occasionally tr acheal intubation or tracheostomy. Laryngoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis of PVCM. Speech therapy and psychotherapy are considered the co rnerstone of management of this disorder. The aim of this article is to increase the awaren ess of PVCM among doctors, highlig hting the main characteristics that distinguish it from asthma and discuss the re cent medical achievements and the possible future perspectives related to this disorder. CUTTING EDGE ARTICLE: Cukier-Blaj S, Bewley A, Aviv JE Nov 8 [Epub a head of print] OBJECTIVES:: The purpose of this study is to determine the larynge al sensitiv ity (LS) thresholds and the ratings of laryngopharyngeal reflux sympto ms in patients with paradoxical vocal fold motion (PVFM). METHODS:: This is a chart review following Institutional Review Board approval of 75 patients from January 2006 to June 2007. The patients were diagnosed with PVFM 192following case history, transnasal flexible laryngoscopy and spiromet ric testing. The data analyzed consisted of the reflux symptom index (RSI) a nd laryngopharyngeal sensi tivity (LS). Laryngeal sensitivity and RSI were graded according to mild, moderate, or severe. RESULTS:: There were 12 (16%) patients with normal RSI scores, 37 pa tients (49.3%) with moderate RSI (RSI 11-22), and 26 patients (34.7%) with severe RSI (RSI >22). The right LS was normal in 11 patients (14.7%), moderately impaired in 16 patients (21.3%), and severely impaired in 48 (64%) patients. The left LS showed normal sensation in 11 pati ents (14.7%), moderately impaired LS in 13 patients (17.3%), and severe impairment in 51 patients (68%). Only one patient had both normal sensation and normal RSI, and 70.4% of patient s had abnormal RSI and sensation thresholds. CONCLUSIONS:: Patients diagnosed with PVFM had a high prevalence of symptoms related to LPR and markedly reduced LS. These findings suggest that PVFM may be triggered by reduced peripheral sensation or laryngeal inflammation. b. Clinical skills and interpretive strategies for diagnosis of upper airway diseases: skin testing (epicutaneous an d intracutaneous); cytology of nasal secretions; understanding for of nasal challenges; rhinoscopy; nasal and ear examination; gross assessment of upper airway imaging studies. i. skin testing REVIEW: Oppenheimer J Skin testing. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2006; 96:S6-12 OBJECTIVE: To provide the reader with a relevant review of the literature regarding skin testing in the allergist's office. DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search for the years 1970 through 2005 was performed using the following keywords: allergy skin testing, skin prick testing, and intradermal skin testing. STUDY SELECTION: Ar ticles that highlighted aspect s of sentinel to clinical allergists' use of skin testing in the office, such as methods of skin testing, intradermal vs skin prick testing, skin test devices, and methods of expressing skin test results, were selected for further review. RESULTS: Skin testing remains the cen tral test to confirm an allergic response. It is minimally invasive and when performed correctly has good reproducibili ty. Results are easily quantifiable and correlate well with end organ challenge. It is im perative however that technicians who perform the skin tests and the clinicians who order or interpret these tests understand the characteristics of the specific te sts they are administering. It is also important that the clinician express skin test results in a manner that allows easy interpretation by another physician. CONCLUSIONS: Allergists must consider controllable variables that affect skin test results and their interpretation. When not considered, they may be responsible for some of the inaccuracies associated with allergy skin testing. REVIEW: Portnoy J Evidence-based allergy diagnostic tests Current Allergy & Asthma Reports 2006;6:455-61 193Effective management of allerg ic diseases reli es on the ability to make an accurate diagnosis. Although clinicians rely on experi ence obtained over many years of practice, such experience is anecdotal and unique to the indivi dual using it. The result is a te ndency for patients with similar clinical presentations to rece ive different diagnoses and treat ment, depending on which provider they happened to see. The probability that a pati ent has a particular diagnosis can be determined using a combination of diagnostic tests. To make th e best use of tests, it is important to understand their performance characteristics in terms of reproducibility and lik elihood ratios. A test that is reproducible but that does not predic t the presence of a disease is not helpful, nor is an accurate test that is not reproducible. To improve the repr oducibility of diagnostic tests, it is important that proficiency testing be instituted for both skin and in vitro tests so that the coefficient of variance can be determined. This has already been done for th e latter and needs to be done for skin tests as well. With use of a combination of history and ap propriate diagnostic tests, the probability that a particular diagnosis is present can be increased or decreased sufficiently either to confirm it or to rule it out. As proficiency test ing of allergy tests becomes more common and the use of tests becomes more consistent, we believe that patie nts with allergic dis eases will benefit. LANDMARK ARTICLE: Malling HJ Proposed guidelines for quantitative skin pric k test procedure to de termine the biological activity of allergenic extr acts using parallel line assay, Allergy; 1987;42, 391-4 Guidelines are proposed for determining the pote ncy of allergenic extr acts in relation to a referenceextract using parall el line bio-assay. The practical performance, limitations, and advantages of skinpric k test are discussed. ii. cytology of nasal secretions DIAGNOSTIC METHODS RESEARCH Ventura MT Validity and reproducibility of morphologic analysis of nasal secretions obtained using ultrasonic of hypertonic solution. Asthma Immunol. 2007;99:232-5. BACKGROUND: Collection of nasal secretions is im portant for the evaluation of upper airways inflammation in many nasal disorders. OBJECTIVE: To study the validity and reproducibility of nasal secretion cellularity induced by nebulization of hypertonic solution in with allergic rhinitis (AR), patients with nona llergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES), and Sixty-eight individuals (29 with AR [mean +/- SD +/- 16.9 years], 23 with [mean +/- SD age, +/- 16.6 y [mean saline solution on 2 different occasions to study the validity and repro ducibility of total and differential cell counts of nasal RESULTS: The mean +/- SD pe rcentage of eosinophils was significantly higher in samples from patients with AR (20.8% +/ - 23.1%) and NARES from controls (0.6% +/- 0.6%; P < .001 for both). There was a significant correlation between 2 samples of nasal secretions obtained on 2 different occasions for percentages of macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and epit helial cells. nasal secretions obtained using ultrasonic nebulization of hyper tonic solution can distinguish patients with AR and NARES from controls. The reprodu cibility of this technique is good for 194macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and epithelia l cells. This me thod could be used to detect nasal airway inflammation in clinical settings. ii. nasal challenges REVIEW: Litvyakova LI Human nasal allergen provocation for determinat ion of true allergic rhinitis: methods for clinicians Curr Allergy Asthma Rep.2002 2:194-202. The nasal provocation test (NPT) co uld be more extensively used in the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis by practicing physicians. However, the procedure has not been standardized, and has mainly been utilized for scientific purposes in the US. This review illustrates a wide variety of techniques and approaches to dosing and concentration of allergen extracts, and delivery systems. It also outlines the lack of a unified outcome s-evaluation system, incl uding clinical symptom scores and nasal patency measurements, in differe nt countries. NPT is a safe, simple, and useful method when conducted with the consideration of indications and contrain dications. Standardized NPT has the potential to become a more frequently used additional c linical test in the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. iv. Rhinoscopy Tichenor WS Nasal rhin osinusitis, including postsurgical patients. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2007 Nov 2 e-publication ahead of print Nasal endoscopy has been practiced by allergists since the early 1980s; however, allergists in general have not embraced endoscopic evaluation of patients with sinus disease, either before or after surgery. Allergists are in a unique position to render medi cal (as opposed to surgical) care of patients with sinusitis. There has been a grow ing realization that e ndoscopy is a valuable procedure for the evaluation and medical treatmen t of patients with difficult sinusitis. This has resulted in the need for a resource to allow al lergists to understand the nature of endoscopic findings in patients with sinusitis , either preoperatively or postoperatively. This article introduces the findings at endoscopy that are common in patie nts with sinusitis, including those that may be seen after surgery. The findings include perfora tion of the septum, retained secretions, small recurrent disease in previously unaffected sinuses, empty nose syndrome, frontal sinus disease, dental disease, and other, more complicated entities. v. nasal and ear examination REVIEW: Onusko E Tympanometry Am Fam Physician. 2004 Nov 1;70(9):1713-20 Tympanometry provides useful qua ntitative information about the presence of fluid in the middle ear, mobility of the middle ear system, and ear canal volume. Its use has been recommended in 195conjunction with more qualitative inf ormation (e.g., history, appearance , and mobility of the tympanic membrane) in the evaluation of otitis medi a with effusion and to a lesser extent in acute otitis media. It also can provide useful inform ation about the patency of tympanostomy tubes. Tympanometry is not reliable in infants younger than seven months because of the highly compliant ear canals of infants. Tympanogram tracings are classified as type A (normal), type B (flat, clearly abnormal), and type C (indicating a significantly negative pressure in the middle ear, possibly indicative of pathology). According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines on otitis media with effusion, the positive predictive value of an abnormal (flat, type B) tympanogram is between 49 and 99 percent. A type C curve may be useful when correlated with other findings, but by itself it is an imprecise es timate of middle ear pressure and does not have high sensitivity or specificity for middle ear disorders. REVIEW: Nathan RA. Objective monitoring of nasal patenc y and physiology in rhinitis. J Allergy Clin Immunol.2005; 115:S442-59 Nasal obstruction can be monitored objectively by measurement of nasal airflow, as evaluated by nasal peak flow, or as airways resistance/conducta nce as evaluated by rhinomanometry. Peak flow can be measured during inspiration or expiration. Of these measurements, nasal inspiratory peak flow is the best validated tec hnique for home monitoring in clin ical trials. The equipment is portable, relatively inexpensive, and simple to use. One disadvantage, however, is that nasal inspiratory peak flow is influenced by lo wer airway as well as upper airway function. Rhinomanometry is a more sensitive technique that is specific for nasal measurements. The equipment, however, requires an operator, is more expensive, and is not portable. Thus, it is applicable only for clinic visit m easures in clinical tria ls. Measures of nasal responsiveness are at present largely confined to rese arch studies investigating diseas e mechanisms in allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. The technique s are insufficiently standardized to be applied to multicenter clinical trials but could be used in limited-center studies to gain insight into the regulatory effects of different therapeutic modalities. REVIEW: Howarth PH. Objective monitoring of nasal rhinitis. J Allergy Clin Immunol.2005; 115:S414-41 Allergic rhinitis is an inflammatory nasal disorder in which a range of different cells participates. A variety of approaches has been used to mon itor nasal inflammation objectively to investigate disease processes and to evaluate the effect of therapeutic inte rvention. These approaches biopsy, to established measurement of nasal nitric oxide (NO) concen tration. Although all provide information about nasal mucosal inflammation, the exte nt of information that can be obtained by each approach, the ease of sampling, and the complexity of sample ha ndling differ. Such considerations influence the choice of approach when measur ement of nasal inflammation is to be an objective outcome parameter in a clinical trial. REVIEW: Uzzaman A 196Acoustic rhinometry in th e Ann Allerg Asthma Immunol 2006; 97:745-51 OBJECTIVE: To provide a com prehensive practical overview of the use of acoustic rhinometry in the practice of allergy. DATA SOURCES: An a ll-inclusive PubMed search was conducted for articles on acoustic rhinometry that were publis hed in peer-reviewed journals, between 1989 and 2006, using the keywords acoustic rhinometry, allergic rhinitis, and nasal provocation testing. STUDY SELECTION: The expert opinion of the authors was used to select studies for inclusion in this review. RESULTS: Acoustic rhinometry is a sound-based technique used to measure nasal cavity area and volume. It has been validated by comparison to measurem ents with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Ac oustic rhinometry requires minimal patient cooperation and may be used in adults, children, and infants. It is used by medical practitioners to diagnose and evaluate therapeutic responses in co nditions such as rhinitis and to measure nasal dimensions during allergen provocation testing. Acoustic rhinometry also provides a visual reflection of the nasal response to therapy, which may be useful in increasing compliance to prescribed medications. CONCLUSIONS: Acoustic rhinometry is a safe , noninvasive, objective, and validated measure of nasal obstr uction that appears to be of pr actical use in the diagnosis and management of inflammatory di seases of the upper airways. vi. upper airway imaging studies REVIEW: Mafee MF Imaging of rhinosinusitis and its complications: plain film, CT, and MRI Clin Rev Allergy Immunol 2006;30:165-86 Conventional plain-film radiogra phy may be used as a screening method for various pathological conditions of the sinonasal cavities. However, CT scanning remains the study of choice for the imaging evaluation of acute and chronic inflamma tory diseases of sinona sal cavities. MRI is superior to CT in differentiating inflammatory conditions from neoplastic processes. The most common complications of rhinosinusitis in childre n occur in the orbit. The information obtained from the CT scan and MRI, together with clinical findings, may be the best guidelines for clinical management and the mode of treatment. Although intracranial complicati ons of sinusitis are relatively rare, prompt recognition of these dis ease states is important to prevent permanent neurological deficit or fatalit y. It is prudent to obtain MRI of the sinuses, orbits, and brain whenever extensive or multiple complications of sinusitis are suspected, in addition to CT scanning. Chronic rhinosinusitis is a clinical diagnosis, confirmed and staged with the CT scan of sinonasal cavities. Chronic inflammatory disease is often associat ed with mucosal thickening and sclerosis of the bone, particularly within the sinuses. Chronic extramuc osal fungal sinusitis develops as a saprophytic growth in retained secretions in a sinus cavity. The imaging manifestations of chronic mycotic rhinosinusitis may be nonspecific or highly suggestive of the presence of fungal infection. The presence of diffu se increased attenuatio n within the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity should be considered as chronic hypersensitivity aspergillosis (chronic noninvasive aspergillosis) or The MRI characteristics of fungal sinusitis depend on the stage of the disease. REVIEW: Bhattacharyya, Jones, Hill and Shapiro, 197The diagnostic accuracy of computed tomogr aphy in the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of pediatric chronic rhinosinusiti s (CRS). SETTING: Multi-instit utional prospective dual cohort study. METHODS: Two cohorts of children under going CT of the paranasal sinuses were prospectively evaluated. The firs t cohort consisted of children undergoing CT in preparation for endoscopic sinus surgery (disea sed group). The second cohort consisted of children undergoing CT for nonsinusitis reasons (nondiseased control gr oup). Sinus CT scans were scored according to the Lund-MacKay system. Diagnostic accuracy was quantified with the receiver operating characteristic curve. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 66 pediatric patients (mean age, 8 years) were studied in the diseased group and exhibited a mean Lund score of 10.4 (95% c onfidence interval, 9.2-11.5) ; 192 control patients (mean age, 9 years) exhibited a mean Lund scor e of 2.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.4-3.2). The area under the curve for the re ceiver operating characteristic was 0.923 (P<.001), indicating excellent diagnostic accuracy. Adopting a Lund score cu toff of 5 to represent true disease, the CT scan demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 85%, respectively. Lund scores of 2 or less have an excellent negative predictive value, whereas Lund scores of 5 or greater have an excellent positive predictive value (ie, strongly indicate true disease). CONCLUSIONS: The sinus CT scan demonstrates excellent diagnostic accur acy for the diagnosis of pediatric CRS, with excellent sensitivity and specificity. However, its predictive value depends substantially on the baserate prevalence of CRS in the population being evaluation. vii. Environmental assessment and control REVIEW: Simpson A The role of allergen avoidance in the secondary prevention of atopic disorders Allergy Clin Immunol. 2005;5:223-7 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Allergen avoidance is recommended as part of the treatment programme of many patients with allergic diseases in Europe a nd the USA. However, clinical trials of allergen avoidance tend to be small and the findings incons istent. Several larger studies have recently been published, making a review of the new literature timely. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been two large double-blind, placebo-controlled studies on the use of encasings (mattress, pillow and duvet) as a single intervention in a dults with asthma. In both studies, participants in the active and the control group showed an improvement in p eak flow, but there was no difference between groups over a 12-month period. A further smaller st udy of encasings reported an improvement in peak flow from 1 week in the active group; this study, however, wa s only of 9 weeks' duration. In children, the use of encasings was associated with a reduction in asthma medication usage, but not until 6 months into the study. A multifaceted intervention study, with the intervention tailored to the child's sensitization status and home environment (includi ng environmental tobacco smoke), resulted in significant reducti ons in emergency room visits and symptoms in the active group. SUMMARY: The evidence suggests th at interventions in children (either single or multifaceted) are associated with a meaningful and sustained improvement in asthma control. However, for adults, allergen proof encasings as a single inte rvention cannot be recomm ended. There is a need for a large-scale multifaceted intervention study in adults with asthma. REVIEW: 198Eggleston P Improving indoor environments: reducing allergen exposures. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2005 ;116:122-6 Homes cannot be m ade allergen free, but exposure to the major indoor allergens can be reduced. All reduction recommendations are based on the principle of reduci ng or isolating the source, and certain recommendations can be made on the basis of published evidence. House dust mite avoidance measures include fitting allergen-pr oof mattress and pillow encasings, washing bedding regularly, and reducing humidity. Furred pet avoidance requires rem oval of the pet form the home, followed by thorough and repeated cleaning; room ai r cleaners, washing the pet, and isolating the pet from a bedroom are ineffective alternatives . Cockroach allergen avoidance begins with effective pest control, followed by thorough and re peated cleaning; 1 to 2 months are required to eliminate roaches, and an additional 4 to 6 months are required to remove residual allergen. Once allergen levels have been reduced, continued effo rts are necessary to maintain the home free of allergen sources. KEY RESEARCH PUBLICATION: Morgan WJ Results of a home-based environmental intervention among urban children with asthma N Engl J Med 2004; 351:1068-80. BACKGROUND: Children with asthma who live in the inner city are expos ed to multiple indoor allergens and environmental tobacco smoke in thei r homes. Reductions in these triggers of asthma have been difficult to achieve and have seldom been associated with decreased morbidity from asthma. The objective of this study was to dete rmine whether an environmental intervention tailored to each child's allergic sensitization and environmental risk factors could improve asthma-related outcomes. METHODS: We en rolled 937 children with atopic as thma (age, 5 to 11 years) in seven major U.S. cities in a randomized, controlled trial of an environm ental intervention that lasted one year (intervention ye ar) and included educa tion and remediation fo r exposure to both allergens and environmental tobacco smoke. Home environmental exposures were assessed every six months, and asthma-related complications were assessed every two months during the intervention and for one year after the intervention. RESULTS: For every 2-week period, the intervention group had fewer days with symptoms than did the contro l group both during the intervention year (3.39 vs. 4.20 days, P<0.001) and the year afterward (2.62 vs. 3.21 days, P<0.001), as well as greater declines in the levels of allergen s at home, such as Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f1) allergen in the bed (P <0.001) and on the bedroo m floor (P=0.004), D. pteronyssinus in the bed (P=0.007), and cockroac h allergen on the bedroom floor (P<0.001). Reductions in the levels of cockroach allergen and dust-mite allergen (Der f1) on the bedroom floor were significantly correlated with re duced complications of asthma (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among inner-city children with atopic asthma, an individualized, home-based, comprehensive environmental intervention decr eases exposure to indoor allergens, cockroach and FRONTIER: of home allergen sampling devices. Allergy. 2005;60:515-20 199BACKGROUND: Simpl e, inexpensive methods of sampling from allergen reservoirs are necessary for large-scale studies or low-cost measurement. Bio-Check devices of our own design: the Electrostatic Cloth Sampler (ECS) and the Press Tape Sampler (PTS); and a Vacuum Sampler as used in many allergen studies (our Reference Method). Devices we re used to collect dust mite allergen samples from 16 domestic carpets. Results were examined for correlations betwee n the sampling methods. RESULTS: With mite allergen concentration ex pressed as microg/g, the Mitest, the ECS and the PTS correlated with the Reference Method but not with each other. When mite allergen concentration was expressed as microg/m2 the M itest and the ECS correlated with the Reference Method but the PTS did not. In th e high allergen conditions of th is study, the Drager Bio-Check did not relate to any methods. CONCLUSIONS: Th e Mitest Dust Collector, the ECS and the PTS show performance consistent with the Reference Method. Many techniques can be used to collect dust mite allergen samples.

Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 2007;98:105-14 OBJECTIVE: To provide a clinical overview of the types of conjunctivitis that are encountered by practicing clinical allergist-immunologists. DATA SOURCES: Published literature in peer reviewed journals found in the National Libr ary of Medicine (PubMed) database using the keywords ocular allergy and/or allergic conjunctivitis. STUDY S ELECTION: Studies related to ocular allergy and/or allergic co njunctivitis were selected for incl usion in this review. RESULTS: Four clinical scenarios are pres ented that mimic frequently enc ountered inflammatory disorders that present as red eyes. CONCLUSIONS: The signs and symptoms associated with the various inflammatory conditions affecting the conjunctiva often ove rlap and need to be differentiated to maximize care for patients with conjunctivitis. REVIEW: Ono SJ Allergic conjunctivitis: update on pathophysiology and prospects for future treatment J Allergy Clin Immunol 2005;115:118-22 Allergic conjunctivitis is in actua of diseases affecting the ocular surfa ce and is usually associated with type 1 hypersensitivity reac tions. Two acute disorders, seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and perennial allerg ic conjunctivitis, exist, as do 3 diseases, and giant papillary (usually mast cell d riven) re sults in itching, tearing, lid and conjunctival edema-redness, and photophobia during the acute phase and can lead to a classic late-phase response (with associated eosinophilia and neutrophilia) in a subset of individuals. As is the case in other allergic diseases, a chronic disease can also develop, accompanied by remodeling of the ocular surface tissues. In severe cases the patient experiences ex treme discomfort and sustains damage to the ocular surface. For such cases, th ere is no highly effective and safe treatment regimen. Topical administration of co rticosteroids is used in severe cases but is associated with an increased risk for the development of cataracts and glaucoma. Thus there is a worldwide search for new biotargets for the treatment of these diseases . Here we provide a brief update of the clinical symptoms associated with these diseases, the rationale for disease classification, recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the di seases, and an update on both preclinical and clinical advances toward refined therapies for these diseases. REVIEW: Manzouri B Pharmacotherapy of allergic eye disease. Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2006 Jun;7(9):1191-200. Allergic eye disease is a term that refers to a number of disease processes that affect about one- fifth of the world's population. Although the more advanced forms of the disease can be sight threatening, the most disabling effects are due to the clinical manifestations, and hence quality of life, with some patients having seasonal exacerbations of their symptoms, whereas others have symptoms that are present throughout the year. Recent increased understanding of the cellular and mediator mechanisms that are involved in the vari ous disease manifestations has greatly facilitated the development of more effective treatment opt ions. Newer topical medications are being used that have multiple actions, such as an antihista minic effect coupled with mast-cell stabilisation, and which require reduced daily dosing due to their longer duration of action. With greater research into newer therapies and more effectiv e modes of delivery, impr oved healthcare outcomes with a lower economic burden will be achieve d for patients with allergic eye disease REVIEW: Schultz BL To evaluate the pharmaco logy of current drug development directed towards ocular allergy. Increased worldwide prevalence of ocular a llergy has stimulated expansion of management strategies towards physio logic and immunologic dr ug targets. RECENT FINDINGS: Present drug targets are located in the conjunctival mucosal surface at the initial site of allergen exposure. Pharmacologi c intervention attends to early and late phase reactions. Targets generating a response include mast cells, IgE, released preformed mediator histamine, and newly formed mediators, such as prostaglandins, leukotr ienes and cytokines. Methods to simulate allergy and measure efficacy of drugs are the conjunctiv al allergen challenge and the conjunctival provocation ured ng, swelling and chemosis. Endpoint instruments such as the Ocular Allergy Index and Eye Allergy Patient Imp act Questionnaire have emerged from the field of pharmacoeconomics. SUMMARY: Important pharm acologic properties of targets have been revealed. First, histamine is more specifically antagonized by second generation antihistamines. 201Second, responders (prostaglandins, adhesion molecule, eo sinophils and antagonized by dual/multiple-action agents. REVIEW: McCluskey P The eye in systemic inflammatory diseases Lancet 2004;364:2125-33 Systemic inflammatory diseases commonly affect th e sclera, cornea, retina, and orbit, and can pose a serious threat to sight. They encompass both primary and secondary vasculitic disorders and specific granulomatous inflammatory conditions. As well as direct eye involvement from the systemic inflammatory process, there can be signs of ocular ischaemia due to maculopathy related to anti-inflammatory drug treatment. Additionally, systemic infection relating to the eye, either as the result of primary infective disease pro cesses or infection secondary to immunosuppression, might be mistaken as endoge nous intraocular inflammation. Infection can closely mimic the ocular signs of endogenous inflammation, and in selected patients (such as those who have been immunosuppressed to treat vascul itis and who additionall y have had invasive surgery, indwelling intravenous catheters, or systemic sepsis), it might be necessary to specifically exclude infection by the sampling and cultu ring of intraocular fluids and tissue. b.

Most cases are benign and can be managed by the primary care provider. The key is recognizi ng cases requiring ophthalmological consultation by differentiating between ciliary and conjuncti val injection. Ciliary injection indicates inflammation of the cornea, iris, or ciliary body, whereas conjunctiva l injection mainly affects the posterior conjunctival blood vessels. REVIEW: Weinstock FJ Common eye disorders: six patients to refer Postgrad Med.1996;99:107-116 Thorough ocular history taking and physical examination are essentia l to establish a diagnosis in patients presenting with eye conditions.

These include corneal ulcers, retinal detachment, iritis, glaucoma, retinal artery occlusion, and endopht halmitis. Because primary open-angle glaucoma can have an insidious onset and cause irrevers ible damage, funduscopic examination should be a part of every complete physical examination. 2023.

Many skin diseases have an inflammatory or immune component, and anti-inflammatory drugs comprise a major portion of a dermatologist's therapeutic armamentarium. Although causes of most of these diseases remain obscure, mechanisms of lesion formation and explanations for symptoms are increasingly well documented. Thes e developments, coupled with the expected availability of novel sele ctive immunomodulatory agents , herald a new era for with psoriasis, allergic contact dermatiti s, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and autoantibodymediat ed blistering diseases are among those who are likely to benefit from advances in the understanding of di sease pathogenesis and the emergence of immunotherapeutics.

Topical IRM therapies, which encompass both proinflammatory and immunosuppre ssive therapeutics, have been used to successfully treat a number of dermatologic conditions. Proinflammatory treatments include Toll-like receptor agonists (e.g., imiquimod 5% cream) and interferon (e.g., interferon-alpha) therapies, which have been used in the treatment of external genital warts, basal ce ll carcinoma, and other dermatologic anti-CD4+ T-cell agents, including calcineurin inhibitors and mycophenolate.

Etiology, Pathophysiology and M echanisms Urticaria & Rep. 2006;6:384-9. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory sk in disease that causes significant morbidity in affected individuals. It is char acterized by dysregulated immune responses that consist of an increased systemic Th2 response and a combination of Th2 and Th1 responses in the skin lesions. In this article, we review fact ors that contribute to these a bnormal responses, including key effector cells of the immune system, chemokines, defective skin barrie r, genetic predisposition, and environmental triggers. Understanding thes e pathomechanisms may improve our current therapies for atopic dermatitis. REVIEW: Cork MJ New perspectives on epidermal (AD) is a multifactorial, chroni c inflammatory skin disorder in which genetic mutations and cutaneous hyper react ivity to environmental stimuli play a causative role. Genetic mutations alone might not be enough to cause clinical manifestations of AD, and this review will propose a new perspective on the importance of epidermal barrie r dysfunction in genetically predisposed individuals, predispos ing them to the harmful effects of environmental agents. The skin barrier is known to be damaged in patients with AD, both in acute eczematous lesions and also in clinically unaffected skin. Skin barrier function can be impaired first by a genetic predisposition to produce increased levels of stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme. This protease enzyme causes premature breakdown of corne odesmosomes, leading to impairment of the epidermal barrier. The addition of environmental interactions, such as washing with soap and detergents, or long-term applica tion of topical corticosteroids can further increase production of stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme and impair epidermal barrier function. The epidermal barrier can also be damaged by exogenous proteas es from house dust mites and Staphylococcus aureus. One or more of these f actors in combination might lead to a defective barrier, thereby increasing the risk of allergen penetration and succeeding inflammatory reaction, thus contributing to exacerbations of this disease REVIEW: Lebwohl M, Impaired skin barrier function in dermatol ogic disease and repair with moisturization. Cutis. 2005 Dec;76(6 Suppl):7-12 There is a substantial body of data demonstrating that atopic dermatitis and various other skin diseases are associated with disturbances of sk in barrier function as evidenced by an increase in 204transepiderm al water loss (TEWL), a decrease in water-binding properties, and a reduction in skin surface lipids, specifically levels of ceramides. The results of clinical studies suggest that these deficits can be addressed through the judicious use of appropriate moisturizers, which have been shown to improve skin hydration, reduce susceptibility to irritation, and restore the integrity of the stratum corneum. Some emollients also supply th e compromised stratum corneum with vital lipids and accelerate barrier recovery. Mo isturizers serve as an important first-line therapeutic option for patients with atopic dermatitis and other chronic skin diseases and can be highly beneficial in improving the clinical signs and symptoms of these challenging dermatologic conditions. ii. Contact Dermatitis REVIEW: relevance of contact dermatitis allergens: a meta-analysis of 15 years of published T.R.U.E. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2004 BACKGROUND: The p atch test pro cedure is frequently employed to help determine or confirm the cause of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). The T.R.U.E. Test has become a global standard and is the commercially available patch test sy stem currently used w ithin the United States. Although many studies report T.R.U.E. Test data, none has measured the overall prevalence and relevance of reactions to the alle rgens tested by the T.R.U.E. Test. Our objective is to describe the prevalence and relevance of contact dermatitis allergens as tested by the T.R.U.E. Test. METHODS: We conducted a search of the MEDLINE database from 1966 to June 2000 for all publications on the use of the T.R.U.E. Test in th e clinical evaluation of ACD in human subjects. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. For each study, we identified and recorded the number of subjects tested, the number of patient s with positive reactions, and the number with relevant reactions. Data were an alyzed using the SAS system (Car y, NC). RESULTS: Ours is the first study to compile the entire corpus of publishe d T.R.U.E. Test data and to examine these data using meta-analytic techniques. The meta-analysis shows that nickel (14.7 % of tested patients), thimerosal (5.0%), cobalt (4.8%), fragrance mix (3.4%), and balsam of Peru (3.0%) are the most prevalent allergens. The 5 leas t prevalent allergens are parabe mix (0.7%), caine mix contrast, North American Contact Dermatitis Data Group (NACDG) da ta show that the 5 mo st prevalent allergens are nickel (14.3%), fragrance mix (14%), data indicate that the prev alence of allergy to cobalt is 9.2%. In order to assess the clinical importance of T.R.U.E. Test allergens, we employ the Significance-Prevalence Index Number (SPIN). Based on SPIN, th e most clinically important allergens tested by the T.R.U.E. Test are nickel (SPIN=894), cobalt (266), fragrance mix (158), colophony (141), and thiuram mix (138). CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify the preval ence of common contact dermatitis allergens as tested by the T.R.U.E. Test and are in general agreement with previously published reports using other patc h test methods. Over 3700 allergens have been identified as causing ACD, of which the T.R.U.E. Test tests only 23. Thus, the T.R.U.E. Test is a screening test at best. Comparison with NACDG data suggests that clinically important allergens may be missed by the T.R.U.E. Test. iii. Urticaria & Angioedema REVIEW: 205Kaplan AP. treatment. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2004;114:465-74. Patients previously designated as having chronic idiopathic urticaria are now divided into 2 groups: 40% to 50% with chronic au toimmune urticaria, and the remainder with chro nic idiopathic urticaria. Patients in both groups may have c oncomitant angioedema (approximately 40%). The autoimmune subgroup has an association with antithyroid antibodies and is caused by IgG antibody to the alpha subunit of the IgE receptor (35% to 40%), usually reactive with unoccupied IgE receptors, or IgG antibody to IgE (5% to 10%). Complement activation secretion by release of C5a. The IgG subclasses th at appear to be pathogenic are IgG(1), IgG(3), and, to a lesser degree, IgG(4), but not IgG(2). Histology of chronic urticaria (both ing infiltrate of CD4(+) lymphoc ytes consisting of a mixture of T (H) 1 and T (H) 2 subtypes, plus monocytes, ne utrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. These cells are recruited as a result of interactions with C5a, cell priming cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Suggested therapy for patients with severe disease involve s the use of high-dose hydroxyzine or an tagonists. The most severe pa tient may require protracted treatment with low-dose alternate-day steroid or cyclosporine. Cyclosporine can be steroid-sparing when side effects are encountered or when use of steroids is re latively contraindicated. Careful monitoring of blood pressure, BUN, crea tinine, and urinal ysis is required. REVIEW: Sheikh J. to the high-aff inity IgE receptor in chronic Opin Allergy Oct;5:403-7 PURPOSE Eighty to 90% of patients with chronic urticaria have no specific external cause for their disease, which is theref ore labeled 'chronic idiopa thic urticaria'. We now know, however, that as many as 30-50% of patients have evidence of an autoantibody to the high- affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI), which may be pathogenic. The exact prevalence and role of these autoantibodies is still under investig ation. RECENT FINDINGS : The frequency of autoantibodies to FcepsilonRI in chronic urticar ia has been estimated at 30-50%, but extensive epidemiological studies have not been done. Recen t work has confirmed that autoantibodies to FcepsilonRI can be functional, meaning that they can cause histamine release from basophils in vitro. Evidence increasingly suggest s that such autoantibodies are also functional in vivo, but conclusive evidence is still lacking. Approximately 50% of cases of urticaria still have no known cause, but recent studies have demonstrated that some of these patients may have intrinsic abnormalities of basophils or mast cells. SUMMARY: Th e recent evidence that is discussed in this review helps to clarify the role of autoantibodies in some cases of urticaria, but also points towards other non-autoimmune mechanisms that might be pa thogenic. Further inves tigation in these areas will help us to understand the cause of urticaria in cases that are still classified as 'idiopathic'. REVIEW: Weldon D. Differential diagnosis of angioedema. Immunol Allergy Clin North Am. 2006 Nov;26:603-13 206There are many conditions that m ay present wi th swelling that mimics angioedema. When swelling persists for greater than a few days or is unresponsive to treatment for urticaria/angioedema, other etiologies should be considered. In most instances, a thorough history and physical examination will define other etiologies. However, for more persistent conditions, further laboratory evaluation and a biopsy may be required to define the diagnosis. Rarely is a more aggressive approach required to make the di agnosis. Clinicians should remember that if the swelling does not act like angioedema, it more than likely is not angioedema iv. Blistering dermatological disorders REVIEW: Stanley J Med 2006;355:1800-1810 Pemphigus, which is caused by auto antibodies, and bullous impetigo (including its generalized form, the staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome), which is caused by Staphylococcus aureus, are seemingly unrelated diseases. However, 200 years ago, astute clinicians realized that these diseases had enough clinical similarities to call bullous impetigo and the scalded-skin syndrome in infants \"pemphigus neonatorum.\" In this review we explain how a common mechanism accounts for the clinical overlap of these blistering diseases of the skin, and how the unraveling of the molecular pathophysiology of pemphigus provided the clues that were necessary to determine the mechanism of the formation of blisters in bullous impetigo and the staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome. We also discuss how this new understanding of the pathophysiology of pemphigus could improve the diagnosis and treatment of this potentially life-threatening disease. REVIEW: Yeh SW, Ahmed B, Sami N, Ahmed AR. Blistering disorders: diagnosis and treatment. Dermatologic Therapy 2003;16:214-223. Blistering diseases are a heterogeneous group of diso rders that can affect either skin and mucous membrane, or both, varying in presentation, clin ical course, pathohist ology, immunopathology and treatment. Not infrequently the diagnosis is delayed. This can result in severe, and sometimes fatal consequences. Although these diseases are rare, it is very important to make an accurate diagnosis based on a combination of clinical profile and laboratory observations. A brief review is presented of the pathohistologic and immunopathologic features and recommendations for therapy are discussed. v. Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis REVIEW: Khalili B Pathogenesis and recent therapeutic trends in Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 2006;97:272-80; 207OBJECTIVE: To review the current pathophysiologi c mechanism s and recent therapeutic trends in Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epid ermal necrolysis (TEN). DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search for SJS and TEN in combination with Fas, Fas ligand (FasL), cytotoxic T cells, intravenous immunoglobulin, and cyclosporine for articles published in English during 1966 to 2006. STUDY SELECTION: Informati on was derived from original research articles and reviews published in peer-reviewed journals. RESULTS: The hallmark of SJS and TEN is epidermal cell apoptosis, which may be mediated through keratinoc yte Fas-FasL interacti on or through cytotoxic T-cell release of perfor in and granzyme B. Whereas system ic corticosteroid therapy showed contradictory results, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and cyclosporine have shown promising outcomes. IVIG contains anti-Fas antibodies that can abrogate apoptosis when preincubated with keratinocytes. Most studies on IVIG in SJS and TEN reported improvement in arresting disease progression and reduction in time to skin heali ng. Because of variations among studies, the findings cannot be optimally compared. In general, mortality varied from 0% to 12% in studies that supported the use of IVIG and 25% to 41.7% in those that did not demonstrate a beneficial effect. Cyclosporine inhibits CD8 activation and thus may reduce epidermal destruction. Relatively few case reports and 1 case series have been published regarding the use of cyclosporine in SJS and TEN. In general, cycl osporine was associated with a significant improvement in time to disease arrest and to co mplete reepithelization, w ith no reported fatalities. CONCLUSIONS: Both IVIG and cyclosporine have been associated with enhanced healing and better survival through inhibition of apoptosis. Multicenter, randomized, pl acebo-controlled trials using a standardized design are need ed to validate these findings. REVIEW: Parrillo S Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Curr Allergy Asthma Rep 2007;7:243-7 Since their first descriptions in 1922 and 1948, re spectively, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) have become recognized as manifest ations--with different severity--of the same disease process along a spec trum of illness. Even today, decades after their description, there is still disagr eement about when a particular bullous disease evolves from erythema multiforme to SJS/TEN. There is no disagreement, however, about the potentially life- threatening nature of the disease. Many cases are misdiagnosed, especi ally in their early stages. In this paper we address our current understanding of this disease spectrum and discuss both accepted and more controversial modes of therapy. c.

REVIEW: Mowad CM Patch PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Contact dermatitis is a common disease process that includes allergic and irritant contact dermatitis. The gold standard for diagnosing allergic c ontact dermatitis, a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction, is patch tes ting. Patch testing is not a difficult procedure, however, there are several critical components that determine the success of the test: having an appropriate level of suspicion for the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis, an adequate threshold for patch testing, the necessary experience to proper ly interpret the results and to determine their relevance, and the ability to thoroughly educate the patient about the condition. RECENT FINDINGS: Research shows that patch testing pr actices differ among indivi duals and specialties. The level of patch testing education, interest in, and experience wit h, the procedure can affect the results of the test. Some of these practice differe nces and how they affect the outcome of patch testing are highlighted. SUMMARY: Physicians' knowledge and experience with patch testing, their level of interest and access to allergens will determine the performance of this test, the reliability of the results and the benefits gained from this procedure. 209 ii.

J Allergy angioedema [HAE]) is a rare disorder for which there is a lack of consensus concerning diagnosis, therapy, and management, particularly in Canada. European initiatives have driven the approach to managi ng HAE with 3 C1-INH Deficiency Workshops held every 2 years in Hungary starting in 1999, with th e third Workshop having recently been held in May 2003. The European Contact Board has establ ished a European HAE Registry that will hopefully advance our knowledge of this diso rder. The Canadian Hereditary Angioedema Society/Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Angio\u00e9d\u00e8me H\u00e9r\u00e9ditaire du Canada organized a Canadian International Consensus Conference held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on October 24 to 26, 2003, to foster consensus between major European and North Am erican HAE treatment centers. Papers were presented by investigators from Europe and North America, and this consensus algorithm approach was discussed. There is a paucity of double-blind placebo-controlled trials in the treatment of HAE, making levels of evidence to support the algorithm less than optimal. Enclosed is the consensus algorithm approach recommende d for the diagnosis, therapy, and management of HAE and agreed to by the authors of this article. This documen t is only a consensus algorithm approach and requires validation. As such, participants agreed to make this a living 2003 algorithm (ie, a work in progress) and agr eed to review its content at futu re international HAE meetings. The consensus, however, has strength in that it was arrived at by the meeting of patient-care providers along with patient group representa tives and individual patients reviewing information available to date and reaching agreement on how to approach th e diagnosis, therapy, and management of HAE circa 2003. Hopefully evidence to support approaches to the management of HAE will approach the level of meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in the near future. v.

Practical Management of Ste vens Johnson syndrome / TEN REVIEW: Chia FL Severe cutaneous reactions to Allergy Clin Immunol. 2007;7:304-9 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper updates the treatment of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis supported by releva nt views about the pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Building on the thesis that Stevens- Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are due to dermal cell apoptosis, molecular pathwa ys that may lead to this have been proposed. 211Intravenous immunoglobulin is post ulated to block apoptosis via the Fas pathway. Most series on the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in toxic epiderma l necrolysis have been favourable. Tumour necrosis factor is also thought to be an important mediator of cell death in toxic epidermal necrolysis. There was impressive control of the progression of toxic epidermal necrolysis with intravenous anti-tumour necrosis factor antibody infliximab in two cases. Strong associations between human leukocyte antigen subtypes and severe cutaneous reactions due to allopurinol and carbamazepine have been described. SUMMARY: To date, there is no established treatment of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis. With advancing knowledge of the pathogenesis, it is hoped that bette r forms of treatment may result. 4. Lower respiratory tract disease a.

Pediatric Asthma REVIEW UPDATE: Szefler SJ. Advances in pediatric asthma 2006. J Allergy Clin Immunol;119:558-62, 2007 Because the outcomes experienced in adult asthma often result from pathophysiology that begins in early childhood, this year's summary focuses on recent advances in pediatric asthma. This past year, we have learned that early intervention with inhaled corticoste roids in childhood asthma reduces morbidity but does not alte r the natural history of asthma. Theme issues over the last year focused attention on severe asthma and black bo x warnings. Both of these themes significantly affect the management of childhood asthma. Respons iveness to asthma treatment is heterogeneous even among patients with asthma of similar sever ity. This heterogeneity calls attention to the importance of assessing control and adjusting treatment accordingly. We are now moving toward an individualized approach to as thma therapy and searching for biomarkers and genetics as a resource to guide treatment. To improve asthma c ontrol, we must continue to obtain information on early asthma, severe asthma, asthma exacerbations, and methods to improve asthma control. Evaluation and management of severe asthma in children include verification of the diagnosis, assessment for coexisting illnesses, and identification of effective treatment strategies directed to adherence, medication delivery, and combination th erapy. Application of bi omarkers and genetics could be useful tools in indi vidualizing our approach to the management of childhood asthma. KEY CLINICAL RESEARCH: Sorkness C Long-term comparison of 3 controller regimens for mild-moderate persistent childhood asthma: the Pediatric Asthma Controller Trial. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2007;119:64-72 212BACKGROUND: More evidence is needed on which to base recomm endations for treatment of mild-moderate persistent asthma in school-age d children. OBJECTIVE: The Pediatric Asthma Controller Trial (PACT) compared the effectiveness of 3 regimens in achieving asthma control. METHODS: A total of 285 children (ages 6-14 years) with mild-moderate persistent asthma on the basis of symptoms, and with FEV(1) >or= 80% 50 microg in the morning and salmeterol 50 mug in the evening (P ACT combination), and montelukast 5 mg in the evening. Outcomes included asthma control days (primary outcome), exacerbations, humanistic measurements, and pulmonary function measurem ents. RESULTS: Fluticasone monotherapy and PACT combination were comparable in many patient-measured outcomes, including percent of asthma control days, but fluticasone monotherapy was superior for clinic-measured FEV(1)/forced vital capacity (P = .015), maximu m bronchodilator response (P = .009), exhaled nitric oxide (P < .001), and PC(20) (P < .001). Fluticasone monothe rapy was superior to montelukast for asthma control days (64.2% vs 52.5%; P = .004) and for all other control outcomes. Growth over 48 weeks was not statistically different (fluticasone, 5.3 cm; PACT combination, 5.3 cm; montelukast, 5.7 cm). CONCLUSION: Both fluticasone monotherapy and PACT combination achieved greater improvements in asthma control days than m ontelukast. However, fluticasone monotherapy was superior to PACT combination in achieving other dimensions of asthma control. Growth was similar in all groups. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Therefore, of the regimens tested, the PACT study findings favor fluticasone m onotherapy in treating children with mild-moderate persistent asthma with FEV(1) >or= 80% predicted, confirming current guideline recommendations. ii. Adult Asthma REVIEW UPDATE: Apter A Advances in adult asthma 2006: its risk factors, course, and management J Allergy Clin Immunol;119:563-6, 2007 This Advances article updates our understanding of ri sk factors for asthma and its course and management. Studies relevant to clinical practice are discussed, w ith special attention to their clinical research methods. REVIEW: Chanez P Severe asthma in adults: what are the important questions? J Allergy Clin Immunol.2007;119:1337-48 The term severe refractory asthma (SRA) in adul ts applies to patients who remain difficult to control despite extensive re-eva luation of diagnosis and management following an observational period of at least 6 months by a specialist. Fact ors that influence asth ma control should be recognized and adequately addressed prior to confirming the diagnosis of SRA. This report presents statements according to the literature defining SRA in order address the important questions. Phenotyping SRA will improve our understanding of mechanisms, natural history, and prognosis. Female gender, obesity, and smoking are asso ciated with SRA. Atopy is less frequent in SRA, but occupational sensitizers are common indu cers of new-onset SRA. Viruses contribute to severe exacerbations and can pers ist in the airways for long periods. Inflammato ry cells are in the airways of the majority of pa tients with SRA and persist desp ite steroid therapy. The T(H)2 213immune process alone is inadequate to explain SR A. Reduced responsiveness to corticosteroids is common, and epithelial cell and sm ooth m uscle abnormalities are found, contributing to airway narrowing. Large and small airway wall thickening is observed, but parenchymal abnormalities may influence airway limitation. Inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment, but patients with SRA remain unc ontrolled, indicating a need for new therapies. iii. Pathogenesis REVIEW UPDATE: Boyce J Asthma 2005-2006: bench to bedside J Allergy Clin Immunol; 2006 118(3):582-6 Asthma is a prevalent and complex syndrome w ith several phenotypic variants. The central features are bronchial infla mmation and airway hyperresponsive ness. Many aspects of asthma, such as control of airway hyperresponsiveness, causative factors, and variable responses to treatment, remain poorly understood. This review hi ghlights some of the latest insights into the pathogenesis of asthma that might ultimately bear on the development or choice of treatment modalities. REVIEW UPDATE: Moore WC Update in asthma 2006. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2007;175:649-54 Asthma-related investigations reported in 2006 ranged from the characterization of clinical asthma and airway obstruction, to human biologic studies and the use of animal models to better understand pathobiologic mechanisms at a cellular and molecular level. The concept of \"risk\" has been featured prominently, with articles identifying factors that increase the risk of developing asthma as well as those aimed at identifying risk factors for asthma exacerbations and adverse outcomes. Studies have continued to explore the utility of noninvasive biomarkers (exhaled nitric oxide, exhaled breath condensate) to identify, modify , and treat disease while increasing understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms in asthma. Clinical trials have sought to optimize treatment with established asthma drugs and to evaluate novel modalities to fill voids in our current armory of asthma medications. Overall, this year has been an interesting journey, particularly in clinical asthma research, challenging accepted con cepts in asthma therapy, and urging clinicians to expand th eir assessment of patients to identify and modify patient risk in addition to traditional measures of asthma control. iv. Exercise Induced Asthma REVIEW: Anderson SD How does exercise cause asthma attacks?. Curr Opin Allergy Clinical Immunol 2006;6:37-42 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To remind read ers that evaporative water loss from the airway surface is the stimulus for exercise-induced bronchoconstr iction. To emphasize that recruitment of the peripheral airways determines se verity of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. To draw attention to the potential for injury of the epithelium and for plas ma exudation to contribute to the pathogenesis of exercise-induced bronchoconstr iction in athletes. To emphasize 214inflammatory mediators are involved in exerci se-induced bronchoconstriction and that some are found in both asthmatic and healthy subjects. RE CENT FINDINGS: That inflammatory mediators are released into the airways in response to exercise and can be measured by inducing sputum (histamine, cysteinyl The concentration of mediators was redu ced in response to a combination of loratadine and montelukast. Exercise is a stimulus for upregulating the genes coding for the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in hea lthy subjects. SUMMARY : Dehydration of the airways results in release of mediators. The likely source of these mediators is the mast cell. Epithelial injury occurs in exercise-induced bronchoconstr iction. The process of repair may contribute to the development of airway hyperresponsiveness in h ealthy subjects. Measuring the airway response to exercise, or a surrogate for exercise, as an indicator of airway hyperresponsiveness is warranted in pa tients with symptoms of asthma. REVIEW: Weiler JM EXERCISE-INDUCED ASTHMA: Work Group Re port: American of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Work Group Report: Exercise-induced asthma J Allergy Clinical Immunol 2007;119:1349-1358.

Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory Disease REVIEW: Stevenson DD Clinical and pathologic perspectives on aspirin sensitivity and asthma. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006;118:773-86 Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammato ry drugs that inhibit COX-1 induce unique nonallergic reactions, consisting of attacks of rhinitis and asthma. These hypersensitivity reactions occur in a subset of asthmatic s ubjects, thus identifying them as having this exclusive clinical presentation. We refer to these patients as having aspirin-exacerbated respir atory disease, a disease process that produces devast ating eosinophilic inflammation of both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. This review focuses on a description of patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, methods available to dia gnose their condition, the unique ability of all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit COX-1 to cross- react with aspirin, an update on pathogenesis, and curren t thoughts about treatment. vi. Emerging Asthma Therapy REVIEW: O'Byrne PM. Cytokines or their antagonists for the treatment of asthma. Chest. 130:244-50, 2006 T helper (Th) type 2 cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13, may be important in the development of allergic asthma. Humani zed monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against IL-5 and a recombinant human soluble IL-4 receptor (sIL-4R) have been developed as possible treatments. These approaches have not yet proven to be successful in pati ents with persistent 215asthma. This m ay suggest that neither IL-4 nor IL-5 is important in asthma pathogenesis. There is, however, insufficient information about the efficacy of sIL-4R and the anti-IL-5 MoAbs in asthma to draw any firm conclusions about the im portance of these Th2 cytokines. Also, the administration of the potentially antiinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and in terferon-gamma has not shown benefit in asthmatic patients. By contrast, the treatment of severe oral steroid-dependent asthma with soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor has demonstrated very promising results, suggesting that this cytokine pl ays an important role in the persistence of severe asthma. vii. ABPA REVIEW: Virnig C Allergic Pulm Med 2007;13:67-71 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present article is an update of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Although a rare c ondition, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis does affect a number of patients with asthma and cystic fi brosis. Prompt recognition and treatment of the disease is critical to improving patient outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: There is currently much active research being performed in the area of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Fascinating insights are being ma de into the pathophysiology a nd genetics of the disease. Additionally, research is ongoing on the use of recomb inant Aspergillus allergens as an aid to the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary asperg illosis. SUMMARY: These new insights into the genetics and pathophysiology of allergic broncho pulmonary aspergillosis and the development of these new diagnostic techniques could ultimately l ead to improved patient treatment. These areas form an important basis for further research viii. Asthma Assessment REVIEW: Lundback B Assessment of asthma control and its impact on optimal treatment strategy. Allergy 2007;62:611-9 Achieving and maintaining optimal asthma contro l is a major asthma management goal advocated by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Recent evidence suggests that while asthma control is clearly achievable in most asthmatics, not all asthmatics attain optimal asthma control. The difficulty is compounded further because patients, physicians and regulatory bodies have different perceptions of what is meant by as thma control. The challenge therefore remains as to how best to assess asthma control and define management strategi es to ensure that this control is achieved and maintained. Despite the availability of several patient-based tools for assessing asthma control, these are mostly employed in a research setting or in selected specialist clinics. A symptom-based treatment approach also may have its limitations because patients can be poor judges of disease symptoms and severity and under-estimation may lead to inadequate treatment of airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR ) when treatment is administered as on- demand reliever therapy, since the effect of treat ment on these underlying features occurs over a longer time course. The clinical be nefits of sustained maintenance treatment for at least 3 months has been documented in recent studies of salm eterol/fluticasone propionate combination, which have demonstrated correlations between reductio n in airway inflammation/AHR and reduction in exacerbation rates. In view of the putative limitations of a purely symptom-based asthma 216manage ment plan, we suggest that treatment shoul d be focussed on management of all aspects of the disease rather than manageme nt of symptoms alone, with a pr actical approach being treatment for a minimum of 3 months with an optimal dose to ensure maximal effects are seen on asthma control, airway inflammation, lung function, and remodelling. WORKSHOP ON ASTHMA SCREENING IN CHILDREN Gerald LB An Official ATS Workshop Report: Issues in Screening for Asthma in Children Proc Am Thorac Soc 2007;133-141 alveolitis as hypersensitivity pneumonitis) is caused by repeated inhalation of mainly organic antigens by sensit ized subjects. This induces a hypersensitivity response in the distal bronchioles and alveoli and subjects may present clini cally with a variety of symptoms. The aims of this review are to desc ribe the current concepts of the immunological response, the diverse clinical pr esentation of this disease, th e relevant investigations and management, and areas for future studies. REVIEW: Mohr LC. known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis, is a granulomatous, inflammatory di sease of the lungs caused by the inhalation of antigenic organic particles or fumes. The diseas e may present as an acute, subacute, or chronic illness. Episodes of acute and subacute HP usually resolve following cessation of antigen exposure. Chronic HP may be progressive, irreve rsible, and result in debilitating fibrotic lung disease. This review discusses current concep ts regarding the diagnos is, pathogenesis, and treatment of HP. RECENT FINDINGS: The pathogenes is of HP involves both type III and type IV hypersensitivity reactions that are mediated by immune complexes and Th1 T cells, respectively. Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines macrophages, into the lungs , facilitate granuloma formati on, and promote the development of pulmonary fibrosis. IFN-gamma is essential for the development of HP and IL-10 appears to modulate the severity of disease. TNF-alpha and TGF-beta have been implicated in development of the pulmonary fibrosis that is seen in chroni c HP. It has been shown that pigeon fanciers with HP have an increase in the frequency of HLA-DRB1*1305 and HLA-DQB1*0501 alleles, a decrease in the frequency of the HLA-BRB1*0802 allele, and an in creased frequency of the TNF- (-308) polymorphism of the TNF-alpha promoter gene. SUMMA RY: A careful environmental and occupational history and esta blishment of exposure to a known inciting antigen are key factors in making the diagnosis of HP. Serum precipita ting antibodies, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsy may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Avoidance of organic an tigen exposure is the 217most important factor in the ma nagement of HP. Corticos teroids are indicated for the treatment of severe acute and subacute HP and for chronic HP that is severe or progressive. Long-term corticosteroid therapy for the treatment of chronic HP should be considered only if objective improvement in clinical signs, pulmonary functio n, or radiographic abnormalities is documented. x. COPD / Bronchitis GUIDELINE REVIEW: Rabe KF Global strategy for the diagnosis, management , and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GO LD executive summary. Am of Respir & Crit Care Med 2006;176(6):532-55 Chronic obstructive pulmonary dise ase (COPD) remains a major public health problem. It is the fourth leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality in the United States, and is projected to rank fifth in 2020 in burden of disease worldwid e, according to a study published by the World Bank/World Health Organization. Yet, COPD rema ins relatively unknown or ignored by the public as well as public health and govern ment officials. In 1998, in an effo rt to bring more attention to COPD, its management, and its prevention, a committed group of scientists encouraged the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization to form the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). Among the important objectives of GOLD are to increase awareness of COPD and to help the millions of people who suffer from this disease and die prematurely of it or its complications. The first st ep in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, published in 2001. The present, newly revised document follows the same format as the original consensus report, but has been updated to reflect the many publications on COPD that have appeared. GOLD national leaders, a network of international experts, have initiated investigations of the causes and prevalence of COPD in their countries, and developed innovative approaches for the dissemination and implemen tation of COPD management guidelines. We appreciate the enormous amount of work the GOLD national leaders have done on behalf of their patients with COPD. Despite the achievement s in the 5 years since the GOLD report was originally published, considerable additional work is ahead of us if we are to control this major public health problem. The GOLD initiative will c ontinue to bring COPD to the attention of governments, public health officials, health care workers, and the genera l public, but a concerted effort by all involved in h ealth care will be necessary. xi. internist. Cleve Clin J Med. 2006;73:1065-74 The care of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has improved over the past 30 years, and most patients now survive well into adulthood. As a result, clinicians other than pediatricians are more likely than in the past to see CF patients and mana ge their respiratory, gast rointestinal, pancreatic, autosomal rece ssive disorder in white people, with a frequency of about 1 in 2500 livebirths. Disc overy of the mutated gene encoding a defective chloride channel in epithelial cells--named cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance improved our understanding of the disorder's pa thophysiology and has aided diagnosis, but has shown the disease's complexity. Gene replacement therapy is still far from being used in patients with cystic fibrosis, mostly because of diffi culties of targeting the appropriate cells. Life expectancy of patients with the disorder has been greatly increased over past decades because of better notions of symptomatic treatment strategies . Here, we summarise advances in understanding and treatment of cystic fibrosis, focusing on pulmonary disease, which accounts for most morbidity and deaths. xii. Sarcoidosis REVIEW: Lynch JP rder of unknown etiology, characteristic ally involves multiple organs. However, pulmonary manifestations typi cally dominate. Chest radiographs are abnormal in 85 to 95% of patients. Abnormalities in pulmonary function tests are common and may be associated with cough, dyspnea, and exercise limitation. However, one third or more of patients are asymptomatic, with incidental abnormalities on chest radiographs. The clinical course and expression of pulmonary sarcoido sis are variable. Spontaneous re missions occur in nearly two thirds of patients. The course is chronic in up to 30% of patient s. Chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis may result in progressive (sometimes life-threateni ng) loss of lung function. Fatalities ascribed to sarcoidosis occur in 1 to 4% of patients. Although the impact of treatment is controversial, corticosteroids may be highly effective in so me patients. Immunosuppressive, cytotoxic, or immunomodulatory agents are reserved for patient s failing or experiencing adverse effects from corticosteroids. Lung transplantation is a viable option for patients with life-threatening disease failing medical therapy. REVIEW: Cox CE. Sarcoidosis Med Clin North Am 2005;89:817-28. Sarcoidosis is a disease found in most populatio ns worldwide, although it has a proclivity for relatively young African-American women in the United States. Although the pathogenesis is unknown, there likely are social, envi ronmental, and genetic factors that are involved. Sarcoidosis seems to be different between whites and Af rican Americans, with the latter population experiencing more severe and chronic disease. Improving access to care and addressing other disparities in health care may help to bridge the gap in health outcomes observed between patients. xiii. Occupational Asthma REVIEW: Mapp C Occupational Asthma 219Am ical evidence indicates that agen ts inhaled at work can induce asthma . In industrialized countries , occupational factors have been implicated in 9 to 15% of all cases of adult asthma. Work-related asthma includes (1) i mmunologic occupational asthma (OA), characterized by a latency period before the ons et of symptoms; (2) nonimmunologic OA, which occurs after single or multiple exposures to high c oncentrations of irritant materials; (3) work- aggravated asthma, which is preexisting or concurrent asthma exacerbated by workplace exposures; and (4) variant syndromes. Assessment of the work environment has improved, making it possible to measure concentratio ns of several high- and low-mo lecular-weight agents in the workplace. The identification of host factors, poly morphisms, and candidate genes associated with OA is in progress and may improve our understandi ng of mechanisms involved in OA. A reliable diagnosis of OA should be confirmed by objective te sting early after its on set. Removal of the worker from exposure to the causal agent and trea tment with inhaled glucocorticoids lead to a better outcome. Finally, strategi es for preventing OA should be implemented and their cost- effectiveness examined. xiv. Chronic Cough REVIEW: Taming Chronic Cough Rank MA, Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2007;98:305-313 OBJECTIVE: To review the available evidence on trea ting chronic cough to relay a thoughtful, evidence-based approach for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough. RESULTS: Few randomized controlled trials have addressed the diagnosis and tr eatment of chronic cough. There are several prospective noncontrolled trials fo r adults with chronic cough that found a high percentage of cough resolution when using an approach that focused on the diagnosis and treatment of the most common causes: asthma, ga stroesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway cough syndrome. Preliminary studies in children s upport an approach that distinguishes between a wet and dry cough, as well as an in-depth investigat ion of any specific symptoms that point to an underlying chronic illness. CONCLUSION: Allergis ts, as experts in treating upper airway and lower airway disorders, are uniquely poi sed to diagnose and treat chronic cough. b.

Bronchial Challenge PRACTICE PARAMETER / GUIDELINE - (METHACHOLINE &EXERCISE CHALLENGE): Official Statement of the American Thoracic Society Guidelines for Meth acholine and Exercise Challenge Testing Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000;161:309-329. REVIEW AIRWAY HYPERRESPONSIVENESS: Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to direct (histamine and methacho line) and indirect (exercise, cold air, hyperventilation, AMP) challenges is a universal and defining feature of asthma. One component of AHR is transient or inducible and occurs after allergen exposu re, for example, and improves occasionally rapidl y after inhaled corticosteroids or e nvironmental control. This transient airway hyperresponsiveness is more marked to th e indirect stimuli. Ther e are convincing data linking this component of AHR to airway inflammation; however, the precise mechanisms linking airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness of the airway smooth muscle are not clear. The other component of AHR is more persistent and is relatively refractory to environmental control and inhaled corticosteroids. This is likely sec ondary to structural airway changes, which are collectively referred to as airway remodeling, and which are a result of the chronic (rather than the acute) effects of airway inflammation. This pe rsistent AHR is best reflected by airway hyperresponsiveness to direct stimuli such as me thacholine. The mechanisms are also uncertain, but reduced airway caliber, incr eased airway wall thickness, increased airway smooth muscle mass, and perhaps contractility likely all play a role iii. Sputum /Exhaled Breath Analysis REVIEW: Hunt J Exhaled breath condensate: an overview. Immunol Allergy Clin North Am. 2007;27:587-96 Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a promising source of biomarkers of lung disease. EBC is not a biomarker, but rather a matrix in which biomarke rs may be identified, in that way equivalent to blood, sweat, tears, urine, and saliva. EBC may be thought of eith er as a body fluid or as a condensate of exhaled gas. The field of EBC research has advan ced gradually, with the debates surrounding an emerging field helping to pose qu estions and gradually leading to answers. Conscientous assay technique will likely find in EBC any substance of substantially high enough concentration in the airway lining fluid. REVIEW: Spahn J Exhaled breath condensate: an overview. Immunol Allergy Clin North Am. 2007;27:607-622 Several inflammatory cells are t hought to contribute to the pat hogenesis of asthma. Among these, the eosinophil appears to be a majo r effector cell. This review focuses primarily on the clinical 221utility of sputum eosinophil counts in asthma . Several studies have shown sputum eosinophils to be associated with both asthma severity and level of asthma control. In addition, the presence of sputum eosinophilia is strongly predictive of a favorable response to gl ucocorticoid therapy. Conversely, the absence of sputum eosinophilia is predictive of a poor response to glucocorticoid therapy. Sputum eosinophilia also predicts asthma relapse in subjects who have their inhaled glucocorticoid reduced or withdrawn. Lastly, inhaled glucocorticoid th erapy can be titrated to keep the sputum eosinophil count at or below 2%. REVIEW: Stewart L Exhaled Nitric Oxide. Immunol Allergy Clin Am. 2007;27:571-86 Exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) is a noninvasive easily measurable biomarker that is proving to be an excellent surrogate for eosinophi lic inflammation in the lungs of patients who have asthma. Although large-scale normative data are still awaited, preliminary st udies have shown FENO to be helpful in diagnosing and assessing severity and control for asthma. FENO levels have also proven helpful in diagnosing and managing seve ral other inflammatory lung diseases. iv. Chest Imaging Silva CI Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: spectrum of high-resolution CT J of Roentgenol 2007;188:334-44 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to illustrate the spectrum of pathologic and high- resolution CT features of hypersensitivity pne umonitis (HP). CONCLUSION: High-resolution CT plays an important role in the di agnosis of HP. A confident diagnosis of subacute HP is based on the presence of ground-glass opacities, poorly defined centrilobular nodules, and mosaic attenuation on inspiratory images and of air trapping on expiratory CT images. Chronic HP is characterized on high-resolution CT by the presence of reticulation due to fibrosis superimposed on findings of subacute HP. Hist ologically, subacute HP is characterized by granulomas, and bronchiol ocentric lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis. also may be seen. The high-resolution CT and pathologic features of chronic HP frequently overlap with those of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and usual interstitial pneumonia. Awaren ess of the various manifestations of HP is important for early diagnosis and management. v.

REVIEW: Sorkness C Long-term comparison of 3 controller regimens for mild-moderate persistent childhood asthma: the Pediatric Asthma Controller Trial. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2007;119:64-72 BACKGROUND: More evidence is needed on which to base recommendations for treatment of mild-moderate persistent asthma in school-age d children. OBJECTIVE: The Pediatric Asthma Controller Trial (PACT) compared the effectiveness of 3 regimens in achieving asthma control. METHODS: A total of 285 children (ages 6-14 years) with mild-moderate persistent asthma on the basis of symptoms, and with FEV(1) >or= 80% 50 microg in the morning and salmeterol 50 mug in the evening (P ACT combination), and montelukast 5 mg in the evening. Outcomes included asthma control days (primary outcome), exacerbations, humanistic measurements, and pulmonary function measurem ents. RESULTS: Fluticasone monotherapy and PACT combination were comparable in many patient-measured outcomes, including percent of asthma control days, but fluticasone monotherapy was superior for clinic-measured FEV(1)/forced 223vital capacity (P = .015), maxim um bronchodilator response (P = .009), exhaled nitric oxide (P < .001), and PC(20) (P < .001). Fluticasone monothe rapy was superior to montelukast for asthma control days (64.2% vs 52.5%; P = .004) and for all other control outcomes. Growth over 48 weeks was not statistically different (fluticasone, 5.3 cm; PACT combination, 5.3 cm; montelukast, 5.7 cm). CONCLUSION: Both fluticasone monotherapy and PACT combination achieved greater improvements in asthma control days than m ontelukast. However, fluticasone monotherapy was superior to PACT combination in achieving other dimensions of asthma control. Growth was similar in all groups. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Therefore, of the regimens tested, the PACT study findings favor fluticasone m onotherapy in treating children with mild-moderate persistent asthma with FEV(1) >or= 80% predicted, confirming current guideline recommendations. REVIEW: Tamesis GP Heterogeneity in response to asthma Allergy Clin 2007;7:185-9 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Evidence for the heter ogeneity of response to asthma medications including inhaled corticosteroids and leukot riene receptor antagonists is mounting. beta2- Adrenoceptor gene polymorphisms may contribute to asthma responsiveness to short- and long- acting beta2-agonists. This review examines recent articles describing vari ability in response to inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene recepto r antagonists and short-acting beta2-agonists specifically in persiste nt asthmatics. RECENT FINDINGS: In the late 1990's, differences in the response to a leukotriene receptor antagonist and an inhaled corticosteroid in adults with moderate persistent asthma were first described. Subsequently, similar findings have recently been elucidated in children with mild to moderate persistent asthma. The variability in response to these two classes of control medicines now appears to encompass all ages with persistent asthma. In general, despite the variability in response to these medications, both resulted in improved clinical and physiologic control measures. SUMMARY: Childhood asthma is a complex disease with numerous clinical phenotypes th at contribute to response vari ability to asthma medications. vi. Practical Management -Key publicatio ns clarifying risks & benefits of asthma therapy vii. Inhaled corticosteroids KEY CLINICAL INVESTIGATION: Guilbert TW Long-term inhaled corticosteroids in preschool children at high risk for asthma. N Engl J Med 2006; 354: 1985-97. BACKGROUND: It is unknown whet her inhaled corticosteroids can modify the subsequent development of asthma in preschool children at high risk for asthma. METHODS: We randomly assigned 285 participants two or three years of age with a positive asthma predictive index to treatment with fluticasone propionate (at a dose of 88 mug twice daily) or masked placebo for two years, followed by a one-year period without study medication. The primary outcome was the proportion of episode-free days during the obser vation year. RESULTS: During the observation year, no significant differences were seen between the two groups in the proportion of episode-free days, the number of exacerbations, or lung func tion. During the treatment period, as compared with placebo use, use of the i nhaled corticosteroid was associat ed with a greater proportion of 224episode-free days (P=0.006) and a lower rate of exacerbations (P<0.001) and of supplementary use of controller medication (P<0.001) . In the inhaled-corticosteroid group, as compared with the placebo group, the mean increase in height was 1.1 cm less at 24 months (P<0.001), but by the end of the trial, the height increase was 0.7 cm less (P=0.008). During treatment, the inhaled corticosteroid reduced symptoms and exacerbations but slowed growth, al beit temporarily and not progressively. CONCLUSIONS: In preschool children at high ri sk for asthma, two years of inhaled-corticosteroid therapy did not change the development of asthma symptoms or lung function during a third, treatment-f ree year. These findings do not provide support for a subsequent disease-modifying effect of inhaled corticos teroids after the treatment is discontinued. KEY CLINICAL INVESTIGATION: Murray CS Secondary prevention of asthma by the use of Inhaled Fluticasone propionate in Wheezy INfants (IFWIN): double-blind, randomised, controlled study. Lancet. 2006 Aug 26;368(9537):754-62 BACKGROUND: Wheezing and asthma often begins in early chil dhood, but it is difficult to predict whether or not a wheezy infant will develop asthma. Some researchers suggest that treatment with inhaled corticosteroids at the fi rst signs of wheezing in childhood could prevent the development of asthma later in life. However, ot her investigators have re ported that although such treatment could help control symptoms, the bene fits can disappear with in months of stopping treatment. We tested our hypothesis that to pr event loss of lung function and worsening asthma later in childhood, anti-inf lammatory treatment needs to be started early in life. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of inhaled fluticasone pr opionate 100 mug twice daily in young children who were followed prospectively and randomised after either one prolonged (>1 month) or two medically confir med wheezy episodes. The dose of study drug was reduced every 3 months to the minimum neede d. If the symptoms were not under control by 3 months, open-label fluticasone propionate 100 m ug twice daily was added to the treatment. Children were followed-up to 5 years of age, at which point we gave their parents or guardians questionnaires, and measured the children's lung function (specific airway s resistance [sR(aw)], forced expiratory volume in 1s [FEV1]) and ai rway reactivity (eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation [EVH] challenge). This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN86717853. FINDINGS: We follo wed 1073 children prospectively, of whom 333 were eligible, and 200 of these began treat ment (130 male, median age 1.2 years [range 0.5- 4.9]; 101 placebo, 99 treatment); 173 (85 treatment, 88 placebo) completed the follow-up at age five years. The groups did not differ significantly in the proportion of children with current wheeze, physician-diagnosed asthma or use of asthma medication, lung function, or airway reactivity (percentage change in FEV1, adjusted mean for placebo 5.5% [95% CI -2.5 vs for treatment 5.0% [-2.2 to 12.2], p=0.87). There were no differences in the results after adjustment for open-label fluticas one propionate, nor betw een the two groups in the time before the open-label drug was added (estimated h azard ratio 1.12 [95% CI 0.73-1.73], p=0.60), or the proportion needing the open-label drug ( 43 [42.57%] placebo, 41 [41.41%] treatment). INTERPRETATION: The early use of inhaled fl uticasone propionate for wheezing in preschool children had no effect on the natural history of asthma or wheeze later in childhood, and did not prevent lung function decline or reduce airway reactivity KEY CLINICAL INVESTIGATION: 225Bisgaard H Intermittent inhaled co rticosteroids in infants with episodic wheezing. N Engl J Med 2006; 354:1998-2005 BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that asthma is preceded by a stage of recurrent episodes of wheezing during the first years of life and that inhaled corticosteroid therapy during symptomatic episodes in this early phase may delay progres sion to persistent wheezing. METHODS: We assigned one-month-old infants to treatment with two-week courses of inhaled budesonide (400 mug per day) or placebo, initiated after a thre e-day episode of wheezing, in this single-center, randomized, double-blind, prospective study of thr ee years' duration. The primary outcome was the number of symptom-free days; key secondary outcomes were the time to discontinuation due to persistent wheezing and safety, as evaluated by height and bone mineral density at the end of the study. RESULTS: We enrolled 411 infants and random ly assigned 294 to receive budesonide at a first episode of wheezing. The proportion of symptom-free days was 83 percent in the budesonide group and 82 percent in the placebo group (absolute difference, 1 percent; 95 perc ent confidence interval, -4.8 to 6.9 percent). Twenty-four percent of child ren in the budesonide group had persistent wheezing, as compared with 21 percent in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 2.13)--a find ing that was unaffected by the presence or absence of atopic dermatitis. The mean duration of the acute episodes was 10 days in both groups and was independent of respiratory viral status. Height and bone mi neral density were not affected by treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent inhaled corticosteroid therapy had no effect on the progression from episodic to persistent wheezing and no short-term benefit during episodes of wheezing in the first three years of life. KEY CLINICAL INVESTIGATION: Jarjour N Control of airway inflammation maintained at a lower steroid dose with 100/50 microg of corticostero ids (ICSs) have been shown to reverse epithelial damage and decrease lamina reticularis thickness in patients with asthma. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether clinical as thma control and airway inflamma tion could be maintained after switching therapy from medium-dose fluticasone pr opionate or =18 years) who, during open-label screening, demonstrated improved asthma control after an increase from 100 microg of FP twice daily to 250 microg of FP twice daily were randomized to erol through a Diskus inhaler (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) twice daily or continue 250 microg of FP twi ce daily through a Diskus inhaler for 24 weeks. Clinical outcomes were monitored, and bronchial biopsy specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were obtained befo re and after 24 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: There were no significant differe nces between treatments with respect to eosinophil cationic protein). The 2 treatments were not different with respect to lamina reticularis thickness. Consistent with the ai rway inflammatory measures, clin ical and physiologic measures of asthma control were also similar. CONCLUSION: Th is study demonstrates that control of asthma and airway inflammation is maintained over the 24-week treatment period when patients requiring 226a medium-dose ICS are switched to a lo wer-dose ICS with a LABA. CLI NICAL IMPLICATIONS: A lower-dose ICS with a LABA is effective in controlling inflammation and providing clinical asthma c ontrol, confirming current guideline recommendations. KEY CLINICAL INVESTIGATION: Szefler S Characterization of within-subject responses to fluticasone and in childhood asthma. J (LTRAs) vary among asthmatic pati ents. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether responses to ICSs and LTRAs are concordant for individuals or whether asthmatic patients who do not respond to one medication respond to the other. METHODS: Children 6 to 17 years of age with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma were randomized to one of 2 crossover sequences, including 8 weeks of an ICS, fluti casone propionate (100 micr og twice daily), and 8 weeks of an LTRA, montelukast (5-10 mg nightly depending on age), in a multicenter, double- masked, 18-week trial. Response was assessed on the basis of improvement in FEV 1 and assessed for relationships to baseline asthma phe notype-associated biomar kers. RESULTS: Defining response as improvement in FEV of 7.5% or grea ter, 17% of 126 particip ants responded to both medications, 23% responded to fluticasone alone, 5% responded to montelukast alone, and 55% responded to neither medication. Compared with those who responded to neither medication, favorable response to fluticasone alone was associat ed with higher levels of exhaled nitric oxide, total eosinophil counts, levels of serum IgE, and levels of serum eosinophil cationic protein levels of pulmona ry function; favorable response to montelukast alone was associated with younger age and shorter disease duration. Greater differential response to fluticasone over montelukast was associated with higher bronchodilato r use, bronchodilator response, exhaled nitric oxide levels, and eosinophil cationic protein levels and lower methacholine PC(20) and pulmonary function va lues. CONCLUSIONS: Response to fluticasone and montelukast vary considerably. Children w ith low pulmonary function or high levels of markers associated with allerg ic inflammation should receive IC S therapy. Other children could receive either ICSs or LTRAs. viii. LongActing Beta Asthma Rese arch Trial: a comparison of usual pharmacotherapy for asthma or usual pharmacotherapy plus salmeterol. Chest. 2006;129:15-26 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety of salmeterol xinafoate or placebo added to usual asthma care. DESIGN: A 28-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, observational study. SETTING: Study subjects were seen once in the study physician's office for screening and were provided all blinded study medication for the entire study period. Follow-up by telephone was scheduled every 4 weeks. PARTICIPANTS: Subj ects (> 12 years old) with asthma as judged by the study physician were eligib le. Individuals with a history of long-acting beta2-agonist use were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Salmeterol, 42 mug bid via metered-dose inhaler (MDI), and placebo bid via MDI. MEASUREMENTS AND RESU LTS: Following an interim analysis in 22726,355 subjects, the study was term inated due to findings in African Americ ans and difficulties in enrollment. The occurrence of the primary outcome, respiratory-related deat hs, or life-threatening experiences was low and not signifi cantly different for salmeterol vs placebo (50 [RR] = 1.40; 95% confiden ce interval [CI], 0.91 to 2.14). Th ere was a small, significant increase in respiratory-relate d deaths (24 vs 11; RR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.06 to 4.41) and asthma- related deaths (13 vs 3; RR, 4.37; 95% CI, 1.25 to 15.34), and in combined asthma-related deaths or life-threatening expe riences (37 vs 22; RR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.89) in subjects receiving salmeterol vs placebo. The imbalance occurred largely in the African-American subpopulation: respiratory-related deaths or life-threatening experiences (20 vs 5; 4.10; 95% CI, 1.54 to 10.90) and combined asthma-related deaths life-threatening e xperiences (19 vs 4; RR, 4.92; 95% CI, 1.68 to 14.45) in subjects receiving salm eterol vs placebo. CONCLUSIONS: For the primary end point in the total population, there were no significant differen ces between treatments. There were small, but statistically significant in creases in respiratory-related and asthma-related deaths and combined asthma-related deaths or life-threatening e xperiences in the total population receiving salmeterol. Subgroup analyses suggest th e risk may be greater in African Americans compared with Caucasian subjects. Whether this ri sk is due to factors in cluding but not limited to a physiologic treatment effect, genetic factors, or patient behaviors l eading to poor outcomes remains unknown. KEY CLINICAL INVESTIGATION: Rabe KF Effect of budesonide in combination with formoterol for reliever therapy in asthma exacerbations: a randomised controlled, double-blind study. Lancet 2006;368:744-753 agonists contro l have not been fully establishe d. We compared the efficacy and safety of three reliever strategi es: a traditional short-acting be ta2 agonist; a rapid-onset LABA (formoterol); and a combination of LABA and an inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide-formoterol) in symptomatic patients receiving budesonide -formoterol maintenance therapy. We did a 12-month, double-blind, parallel-group study in 3394 patients (a ged 12 years or older), in 289 centres in 20 countries, who were using in haled corticosteroids at study entry and symptomatic on budesonide-formoterol (160 microg and 4.5 microg, respectively), one inhalation twice daily, during a 2-week run- in. After run-in, patients were randomly assigned budesonide- formoterol maintenance therapy plus one of th ree alternative as-needed medications-terbutaline (0.4 mg), formoterol (4.5 microg), or budesonide-formoterol (160 microg and 4.5 microg). The primary outcome was time to first severe ex acerbation, defined as an event resulting in hospitalisation, emergency room treatment, or both, or the need for oral steroids for 3 days or more. FINDINGS: Time to first severe exacer bation terbutaline (p=0.0051). The rate of severe ex acerbations was 37, 29, and 19 per 100 patients per year with as-needed terbutaline, formoterol, and control days increased to a similar extent in all treatment groups. As- needed formoterol did not significantly im prove sy mptoms compared with as-needed terbutaline. All treatments INTERPRETATION: Both monocomponents of budesonide- 228formoterol g iven as needed contribute to enhanced protection from severe exacerbations in patients receiving combination therapy for maintenance. KEY CLINICAL INVESTIGATION: Wechsler ME. Adrenergic receptor polymorphisms and response to salmeterol. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2006;173:519-526. RATIONALE: Several studies suggest that patients with asthma who are homozygous for arginine at the 16th position of the beta2-adrenergic receptor may not benefit from short-acting beta- agonists. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whethe r such genotype-specific effects occur when patients are treated with long-acting beta-agonist s and whether such effects are modified by concurrent inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use. METHODS: We compared salmeterol response in patients with asthma homozygous for arginine at (B16Arg/Arg) with those homozygous for glycine at B16 (B16Gly/Gly) in tw o separate cohorts. In the firs t, subjects were randomized to regular therapy with salmeterol while simulta neously discontinuing ICS therapy. In the second, subjects were randomized to regular therapy with salmeterol while continuing concomitant ICS. RESULTS: In both trials, B16Arg /Arg subjects did not benefit compared with B16Gly/Gly subjects after salmeterol was init iated. In the first cohort, compared with placebo, the addition of salmeterol was associated with a 51.4 L/min lowe r A.M. peak expiratory flow (PEF; p = 0.005) in B16Arg/Arg subjects(salmeterol, n = 12; placebo, n = 5) as compared with B16Gly/Gly subjects (salmeterol, n = 13; placebo, n = 13). In the seco nd cohort, B16Arg/Arg subjects treated with salmeterol and ICS concurrently (n = 8) had a lower A.M. PEF (36.8 L/min difference, p = 0.048) than B16Gly/Gly subjects (n = 22) treated wi th the same regimen. In addition, B16 Arg/Arg subjects in the second cohort ha d lower FEV1 (0.42 L, p = 0.003), increased symptom scores (0.2 units, p = 0.034), and increased albuterol rescue use (0.95 puffs /d, p = 0.004) compared with B16Gly/Gly subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to B16Gly/Gly patients with asthma, B16Arg/Arg patients with asthma may have an impaired therapeutic response to salmeterol in either the absence or presence of concurrent ICS us e. Investigation of alternate treatment strategies may benefit this group. KEY CLINICAL INVESTIGATION: Bleecker ER Salmeterol response is not affected by b2-ad renergic receptor genotype in subjects with persistent asthma. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006;118:809-816. BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that there might be an a ssociation between albuterol use and worsening asthma in patients homozygous fo r arginine (Arg/Arg) at codon 16 of the beta- receptor. However, it is not known whether similar responses occur in Arg/Arg patients receiving long-acting beta2-agonists. OBJECT IVE: We sought to evaluate th e effects of variation in the beta2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2) on clinical response to salmeterol administered with fluticasone propionate. METHODS: Subjects (n = receiving were randomized to with fluticasone propionate, 100 microg, in a single inhaler or daily therapy with montelukast for 12 weeks, followed by a 2- to 4-day run-out peri od. RESULTS: There was su stained and significant improvement (P < .001) over baselin e in all measures of asthma control in subjects receiving salmeterol, regardless of Arg16Gly genotype. Morning peak expiratory flow in with genotype showed 89.0 +/- 16.1 m in for Arg/Gly subjects. Pairwise changes were similar for Arg/Arg compared with Gly/Gly or Arg/Gly genotypes (est imated differences, 4.7 L/min and 3.5 L/min, respectively). Responses did not appear to be modified by haplotype pairs. During the run-out period, all subjects had predicta ble and similar decreases in measures of asthma control, with no differences between genotypes. CONCLUSION: Response to salmeterol does not vary between ADRB2 genotypes after chronic dosi ng with an inhaled corticosteroid. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Analyses from this study indi cate that genetic polymorphisms leading to Arg16Gly sequence changes within the beta2-adrenergic receptor do not affect patients' responses to recommended asthma therapy with sa lmeterol and fluticasone propionate. ix. Genetic polymorphisms and beta agonists LANDMARK INVESTIGATION: Martinez FD. Association between genetic polymorphisms of the b2-adrenoceptor and response to albuterol in children with and wi thout a history of wheezing. J Clin Invest 1997;100:3184-3188. The beta2-adrenergic receptor (bet a2AR) agonists are the most widely used agents in the treatment of asthma, but the genetic determinants of responsiveness to these agents are unknown. Two polymorphic loci within the coding region of the beta2AR have been recently described at amino acids 16 and 27. It has been reported that glycine at codon 16 (Gly-16) is a ssociated with increased downregulation of the beta2AR as compared with arginine-16 (Arg-16). The form of the receptor with glutamic acid at c odon 27 (Glu-27), on the other hand, has been shown to be resistant to downregulation when compared with glutamine-27 (Gln-27), but only when coexpressed with Arg-16. To assess if differe nt genotypes of these two polymorphisms would show differential responses to inhaled beta2AR agonists, we genotyped 269 children who were participants in a longitudinal study of asthma. Spirometry was performed before and after administration of 180 microg of albuterol, and a positive response was considered an increase of >15.3% predicted FEV1. There was marked linkage disequilibrium between the two polymorphisms, with 97.8% of a ll chromosomes that carried Ar g-16 also carrying Gln-27. When compared to homozygotes for Gly-16, homozygotes for Arg-16 were 5.3 times (95% confidence interval 1.6-17.7) and heterozygo tes for beta2AR-16 were 2.3 times (1.3-4.2) more likely to respond to albuterol, respectively. Similar trends were observed for asthmatic and nonasthmatic children, and results were independent of baseline lung function, ethnic origin, and previous use of antiasthma medication. No association was found between the beta2AR-27 polymorphism and response to albuterol. These results may explain some of the variability in response to therapeutic doses of albuterol in children. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Israel E Use of regularly scheduled albuterol treatment in asthma: genotype-stratified, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Lancet 2004;364:1505-1512. BACKGROUND: The issue of whether regular use of an inhaled beta2-adrenergic agonist worsens airflow and clinical outcomes in asthma is controversial. Re trospective studies have suggested that adverse effects occur in patients with a genetic polymorphism that results in homozygosity for arginine (Arg/Arg), rather than (Gly/Gly), at the existen ce of any genotype-d ependent difference has not been tested in a prospective clinical trial. METHODS: Patien ts with mild asthma, not using a controller medication, were enrolled in pairs matched for for ced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) according to whether they had the Arg/Arg (n=37; four of 41 matches withdrew before randomisation) or Gly/Gly (n=41) genotype. Regularly scheduled treatment with albuter ol or placebo was given in a masked, cross-over design, for 16-week periods. During the study, as-needed albuterol use was discontinued and ipratropium bromide was used as needed. Morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was the primary outcome variable. The primary comparisons were between treatment period for each genotype; the secondary outcome was a treatment by genotype effect. Analyses were by intention to treat. FINDI NGS: During the run-in period, when albuterol use was kept to a minimum, patients with the Arg/Arg genotype ha d an increase in morning PEFR of 23 L/min (p=0.0162); the change in patients with the Gly/ Gly genotype was not si gnificant (2 L/min; p=0.8399). During randomised treatment, patients with the Gly/Gly genotype had an increase in morning PEFR during treatment with regularly scheduled albuterol compared with placebo (14 L/min [95% CI 3 to 25]; p=0.0175). By contrast, patients with the Arg/Arg genotype had lower morning PEFR during treatment with albuterol than during the pl acebo period, when albuterol use was limited (-10 L/min [-19 to -2]; p=0.0209). The genotype-attributable treatment difference was therefore -24 L/min (-37 to -12; p=0.0003). There were similar genot ype-specific effects in FEV1, symptoms, and use of supplementary reliever medication. INTERPRETATI ON: Genotype at the 16th aminoacid residue of the beta2-adrenergic re ceptor affects the long-term response to albuterol use. Bronchodilator treatments avoiding albutero l may be appropriate for patients with the Arg/Arg genotype. x.

OBJECTIVE: To review inhaled antigens in ho m e environments that cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) of varied clinical expressi ons and histopathologic patterns. DATA SOURCES: Computer-assisted MEDLINE and manual searches for articles concerning HP, interstitial lung disease (ILD), epidemiology of HP and ILD, ch allenge procedures of HP, and indoor fungi. STUDY SELECTION: Published artic les concerning inhaled antigens in home environments and HP were selected. RESULTS: Current criteria for th e diagnosis of HP are too restrictive, because most apply only to the classic acu te presentation and are of limited value in the subacute and insidious forms. Clinical expressions vary across the gamut of respiratory tract signs and symptoms. Patterns on lung biopsy may include all hi stopathologic descriptions of idiopathic ILD. The home is the likely causative environment rath er than the workplace. Exposures may be occult and require in-depth environmental histories and on-site investigations to detect antigens and sources. CONCLUSIONS: Natural or environmental ch allenges have become an important tool for diagnosing HP and determining effectiveness of remediation. Early diagnosis and effective remediation of the cause lead to a high survival rate, whereas diagnos is in advanced stages leads to disability and/or premature death. xiii.

REVIEW: Chang AB Guidelines for Evaluating Chronic Cough in Pediatrics: ACCP Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines Chest. 2006;129:260S-283S OBJECTIVE: To review relevant li terature and present evidence-based guidelines to assist general and specialist medical practitioners in the evaluation and management of children who present with chronic cough. METHODOLOGY: The Cochrane, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases, review articles, and reference lists of relevant articles were searched and reviewed by a single author. The date of the last comprehensive search was December 5, 2003, and that of the Cochrane database was November 7, 2004. The authors' own databases and expertise identified additional articles. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric chronic cough ( ie, cough in children aged < 15 years) is defined as a daily cough lasting for > 4 weeks. This time frame was chosen based on the natural history of URTIs in children and differs from the definition of chronic cough in adults. In this guideline, only chronic cough will be discussed. Chronic cough is subdivided into specific cough (ie, cough associated with other symptoms and signs suggestive of an associated or underlying problem) and nonspecific cough (ie, dry cough in the absence of an identifiable respiratory disease of known etiology). The majority of this section focuses on nonspecific cough, as specific cough encompasses the entire spectrum of pediatric pulmonology. A review of the literature revealed few randomized controlled trials for treatment of nonspecific cough. Management guidelines are summarized in two pathways. Recommendations are derived from a systematic review of the literature and were integrated with expert opinion. They are a general guideline only, do not 233substitute for sound clinical judgment, and are not intended to be used as a protocol for the management of all children w ith a coughing illness. Children (aged < 15 years) with cough should be managed according to child-specific guidelines, which differ from those for adults as the etiologic factors and treatme nts for children are sometimes different from those for adults. Cough in children should be treated based on etiology, and there is no evidence for using medications for the symptomatic relief of cough. If medications are used, it is imperative that the children are followed up and therapy with the medications stopped if there is no effect on the cough within an expected time frame. An evaluation of the time to response is importa nt. Irrespective of diagnosis, environmental influences and pa rental expectations should be discussed and managed accordingly. Cough often impacts the quality of life of both children and pa rents, and the exploration of parental expectations and fears is ofte n valuable in the management of cough in children. REVIEW: Rank MA Taming chronic cough. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 98:305-13 OBJECTIVE: To review the avai lable evidence on trea ting chronic cough to relay a thoughtful, evidence-based approach for the diagnosis a nd treatment of chronic cough. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched using th e following keywords: cough, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, sinusitis, rhinitis (allergic, s easonal), postnasal drip, vocal cord dysfunction, lung disease (interstitia l), bronchiectasis, and bronchoscopy. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected based on their relevance to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough. Because of a lack of random ized prospective studies, nonrandomized and retrospective studies were cons idered, with their strengths and limitations noted. RESULTS: Few randomized controlled trials have addressed the diagnosis and tr eatment of chronic cough. There are several prospective noncontrolled trials fo r adults with chronic cough that found a high percentage of cough resolution when using an approach that focused on the diagnosis and treatment of the most common causes: asthma, ga stroesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway cough syndrome. Preliminary studies in children s upport an approach that distinguishes between a wet and dry cough, as well as an in-depth investigat ion of any specific symptoms that point to an underlying chronic illness. CONCLUSION: Allergis ts, as experts in treating upper airway and lower airway disorders, are uniquely poi sed to diagnose and treat chronic cough. 5. Drug Allergy (See dermatologic disorders and anaphylaxis) a. General Reviews a nd Susceptibility States REVIEW: Greenberger PA Drug Allergy (MiniPrimer) J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006;117:S464-70 Drug reactions can be considered as being either predictable or unpredictable. A predictable reaction would be the result of the pharmacologic action of the medication. An unpredictable reaction might be idiosyncratic, might be drug intolerance, or mi ght have or imply an immunologic basis, such as being IgE medi ated. Immediate reactions that are not IgE mediated can be considered as pseudoallergic (non-IgE-mediated ma st cell activation). This review will discuss allergic and immunologic reacti ons to immunomodulat ors, aspirin, and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and consider the serious drug-related conditions of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The field of drug \"allergy\" has expanded to include adverse reactions associated with immunosuppressive medications, antic ytokine therapies, and mAbs. The cytokine release reaction that occurs with anti-CD20 antibody infusions in patients with leukemia and white blood cell counts of greater than 50 x 10(9)/L is associated with high concentrations of TNF, IL-6, and IL-8. Because of the findings of fever, dyspnea, ri gors, and hypotension, this reaction resembles the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction that occurs 60 to 90 mi nutes after penicillin administration in patients with secondary syphilis. Furthermore, the care of the patient with penicillin allergy has been made more difficult in the absence of the major determin ant, penicilloyl-polylysine, in that from 34% to 84% of patients who have positive skin test re actions to penicillin have exclusively positive reactions to the major determinant. SJS and TEN typically are caused by medi cations within 1 to 8 weeks of initiation of therapy. Evidence for death of the keratinocytes through (1) drug-specific cytotoxicity with the perforin-granzyme B- mediated killing and (2 ) activation of Fas on keratinocytes have provided explanations for the sloughing of skin. Unfortunately, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for SJS a nd TEN has been disappointing. REVIEW: Gruchalla R Clinical Practice.

Evidence supporting various strategies is then presented, followed by a review of formal guidelines, when they exist. The article ends with the authors' clinical recommendations. REVIEW: Brackett CC Sulfonamide allergy and Concerns about cross-allergenicity between sulfonamide antibiotics and nonantibiotic sulfonamide-containing drugs continue to complicate pharmacotherapy. Several elegant investigations have demonstrated unequivocal la ck of interaction betw een the sulfonamide group and either cellular or humoral immunity. The immunologic determinant of type I immunologic non-type I hypersensi tivity responses to su lfonamide antibiotics are attributable to reactive metabolites that cause either direct cytotoxicity or humoral or cellular responses. Metabolite formation is stereospecific to the N4 am ino nitrogen of the sulfonamide antibiotics, a structure not found on any nonan tibiotic sulfonamide drugs. Cellular immune responses to sulfonamide are responsible for many non-immunoglobulin E-mediated dermatologic however, th e stereospecificity renders cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and nonantibioti cs highly unlikely. Apparent cross-reactivity responses to sulfonamide-containing drugs likely re present multiple concurrent, rather than linked, drug hypersensitivities.

In the first decade of HI V treatment, this mainly involved drugs used to treat HIV-related infections but now primarily includes drugs used to treat HIV. This review focuses on the current knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology and clinical features of drug hypersensitivity reactions of drugs used in the management of the HIV-infected patient. Our understanding of the immunogenetics and host predisposi tion to drug hypersensitivity has been advanced considerably by the antiretroviral drugs abacavir and nevirapine . The association of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction with HLA-B*5701 has been particularly important and provides a basis for genetic screening in the clinic setting. The increased predisposition of drug hypersensitivity disease in HIV will continue to provide a fertile ground for study of the diverse and complex processes that drive its pathophysiology. Our knowledge of drug hypersensi tivity will also increase as the expanding armentarium of antiretroviral therapy is applied to more diverse populations in the developing world. The potential for wide spread implementation of HLA-B*5701 screening for abacavir hypersensitivity will set an important precedent for bringing individualized medicine to the clinic and the use of genetic tes ting to improve drug safety. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Pirmohamed M Genetic Factors in the AAPS Journal. 2006: 8; E20-E26 Drug hypersensitivity can occur with most drugs, although the fr equency, severity, and clinical manifestations vary. Case reports have suggested that there may be familial clustering of drug hypersensitivity suggesting a genetic pred isposition. As with most other forms of drug response, predisposition to drug hypersensitivity r eactions is likely to be multifactorial and multigenic. Given the immune pathogenesis of these reactions, it is perhaps not surprising that the most significant genetic associatio ns have been identified in the major histocompatibility complex for drugs such as abacavir, carbamazepine, and allopurinol. For abacavir, it has been suggested that preprescription genot yping for HLA-B*5701 in whites may reduce the incidence of hypersensitivity. It is likely that as our knowledg e of variation in the human genome improves, coupled with improvements in t echnology, many more significant ge netic predisposing factors for drug hypersensitivity are likely to be identified in the next decade. However, as we search for these genetic factors, it is important that we do not fo rget environmental predisposition, and to bear in mind that a genetic marker for drug hypersensitiv ity in one population may not necessarily be relevant for another population. No twithstanding the advances in ge netic technologie s, the ultimate determinant of success in this area of research will be the identification and careful phenotyping of patients with drug hypersensitivity reactions. As we progress to whole genome scanning, in order to satisfy the requirements for adequate statisti cal power, the identificatio n of large numbers of carefully phenotyped patients will be feasible only through interna tional collaborations. 236PURPOSE OF REVIEW : The present article reviews the recent literature on the identification of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles as major susceptible genes for drug hypersensitivity and discusses the clinical implications. RECENT FINDINGS: Several recent studies have reported strong genetic associations betw een HLA alleles and susceptibility to drug hypersensitivity. The genetic associations can be drug specific, such as HLA-B *1502 being associated with carbamazepine-induced cutaneous adverse reactions. A ge netic association can also be phenotype-specific, as B*1502 is associated solely with carbamazepine-SJS/TEN, a nd not with either maculopapular eruption or hypersensitivity syndrome. Furthermore, a genetic association can also be ethnicity specific; carbamazepine-SJS/TEN associated with B*1502 is seen in south-east Asians but not in whites, which may be explained by the different alle le frequencies. SUMMARY: The strong genetic association suggests a direct i nvolvement of HLA in the pathoge nesis of drug hypersensitivity when the HLA molecule presents an antigenic drug for T cell activation. The high sensitivity/specificity of some markers provides a plausible basis for developing tests to identify individuals at risk for drug hypersensitivit y. Application of HLA-B*1502 genotyping as a screening tool before prescribing carbamazepin e could be a valuable tool in preventing carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN in south-east Asian countries. REVIEW: Sanderson reactions are a majo r problem in both clinical treatment and drug development. This review covers recent deve lopments in our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved, with special focus on the poten tial role of metabolism and bioactivation in generating a chemical signal for activation of the immune system. The possible role of haptenation and neoantigen formation is discussed, alongside recent findings that challenge this paradigm. Additionally, the essential role of costimulation is examined, as are the po tential points whereby costimulation may be driven by reactive metabol ites. The relevance of local generation of metabolites in determining the location and character of a reaction is also covered.

Distinction between hypersensitivity and intolerance REVIEW: Demoly P Classification and Epidemiology of Hypersensitivity Drug Reactions Immunol Allergy Clin N Am 2004;24:345-56 Nonimmune hypersensitivity reactions are unpredictable adverse drug reactions that are clinically similar to allergic reactions for which no drug-spec ific antibodies or T lym phocytes are identified. Few tools allow a definite diagnos is, and most of the available ones need to be validated. True 237epidemiologic data are limited, and most of the available inform ation on the incidence, mortality, and socioeconomic impact should be discussed with caution. REVIEW: Volcheck G Clinical Evaluation and Management of Drug Hypersensitivity Immunol Allergy Clin N Am 2004;24:357-71 Adverse drug reactions are a major health problem in the inpatient and outpatient clinical setting. Although all of the immune mechanisms of drug reactions are not well ch aracterized, a detailed medication history, knowledge of the signs a nd symptoms associated with known immune mechanisms, and knowledge of the t ypes of medications typically asso ciated with distinct immune reactions are helpful in implicating the causative drug. Standardized testing for drug reactions is limited, especially for non-IgE-me diated reactions. Management c onsists of stopping the offending drug, treating the acute reaction, and making a de termination concerning future use of the drug. c. Cytotoxic, immune complex and delayed hypersensitivity reactions Exp Allergy 2007;37:389-99. Immune reactions to small molecular compounds such as drugs can cause a variety of diseases mainly involving skin, but also liver, kidney, lung s and other organs. In addition to the well-known immediate, IgE-mediated reactions to drugs, ma ny drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions appear delayed. Recent data have shown that in these de layed reactions drug-speci fic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells recognize drugs through their T cell receptors (TCR) in an MHC-dependent way. Immunohistochemical and functional studies of dr ug-reactive T cells in pa tients with distinct forms of exanthems revealed that distinct T cell functions lead to differe nt clinical phenotypes. Taken together, these data allow delayed hypers ensitivity reactions (type IV) to be further subclassified into T cell reactions, which by releasing certain cytokines and chemokines preferentially activate and recruit monocytes (t IVb), or unctions by either CD4(+) or CD8( +) T cells (type IVc) seem to participate in all type IV reactions. Drugs are not only immunogenic becau se of their chemical reactivity, but also because they may bind in a labile way to available TCRs and possibly MHC- molecules. This seems to be sufficient to stimul ate certain, probably preactivated T cells. The drug seems to bind first to the fitting TCR, which alre ady exerts some activation. For full activation, an additional interaction of the T CR with the MHC molecules is needed. The drug binding to the receptor structures is reminiscent of a pharm acological interaction between a drug and its (immune) receptor and was thus termed the p-i concept. In some patients with drug hypersensitivity, such a response occurs within hour s even upon the first e xposure to the drug. The T cell reaction to the drug might thus not be due to a classical, primary response, but is due to peptide-specific T cells which happen to be st imulated by a drug. This new concept has major implications for understanding clin ical and immunological features of drug hypersensitivity and a model to explain the frequent skin symp toms in drug hypersensitivity is proposed. REVIEW: Lopez S. 238Non-immediate reactions to beta-lactams includ e several clinical entities, from maculopapular rash to severe reactions such as Steven-Johnson syndrome. Toxic epidermal necrolysis and organ-specific r eactions may also occur. RECENT FINDINGS: Progress has been made in understanding the role of the immunologi cal system in nonimmediate reactions to beta- after hapten ation of serum or cell proteins in the context of major histocompatibility comp lex. Studies using T-cell lines and clones have shown that a heterogeneous response is generated, with the expression of different cytokine profiles. Betalactams also act on dendritic cells, induc ing changes that enable them to interact with na\u00efve lymphocytes, becoming memory T cells. Tissue-activated CD4 and CD8 cells express perforin and other cytotoxic mediat ors that elicit the lesions. Studies on the clinical course of these entities indicate that cells migrate, establishing a recirculation with homing to the skin and back to the circulation. These cells thus participate not only in skin lesions but probably also in the repair process. SUMMARY: Understanding the immunological mechanisms involved in nonimmediate reactions to beta-lactams has im proved over the last few years, with better definition of the different T-cell subpopulations i nvolved. Experimental studies and monitoring of the response support the implication of different cell subsets. REVIEW: Arndt PA The Changing spectrum of Sem Hematol 2007:42:137-144 Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia (DIIHA) occurs rarely. To date, about 100 drugs have been implicated in causing DIIHA and/or a posit ive direct antiglobulin test (DAT). The most common drugs associated with DIIHA in the 197 0s were methyldopa and penicillin; currently, they are cefotetan and lin type\" or type\"); some patients have combinations of these antibod ies. Some drugs cause nonimmunologic protein adsorption onto drug-treated red blood cells (RBCs ). This is known to be the cause of positive indirect antiglobulin tests and is suspected to be a cause of positive DATs. This mechanism may be associated with hemolytic anemia. Twelve ce phalosporins have been reported to cause DIIHA; five (primarily cefotetan and ceftr iaxone) have been associated with fatalites. Patients with DIIHA due to cefotetan may only have received one dos e of the drug prophylactically with surgery. Antibodies to cefotetan react to very high titers against drug-tr eated RBCs (and at lower titers against untreated RBCs without and/or with drug present). Patients with ceftriaxone-induced DIIHA have received the drug previously; reac tions in children often occur minutes after ceftriaxone administration. Antibodi es to ceftriaxone are only of the \"immune complex type.\" REVIEW: Richard HA Drug-induced immune cytopenias Toxicology 2005:209:149-153 Drugs can induce thrombocytopenia by several mechanisms, including m arrow suppression and destruction of platelets in th e peripheral blood by non-immune and immune mechanisms. We will review here current understandi ng of the immune mechanisms by which drugs promote immune- 239mediated platelet destruction resulting in thro m bocytopenia. Immune cy topenia is a relatively common and poorly understood side effect of many drugs. Aff ected target cells include erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets and, probably, hematopoietic precursor cells in the marrow. For unknown reasons, platelets are affected much more often than the other ce ll types. We will here consider drug-induced immune thrombocytopeni a (DITP) as a model for drug-induced dyscrasias having an immunologic pathogenesis. Drug-induced antibodies cause platelet destruction by a number of different mechanisms , each of which will be discussed in turn. REVIEW: Roychowdhury S Mechanisms of Drug-induced Delayed-type Skin. AAPS J. 2005:7:80-5 Cutaneous drug reactions (CDRs) are the most commonly reported adverse drug reactions. These reactions can range from mildly discomforting to life threateni ng. CDRs can arise either from immunological or nonimmunological mechanisms, though the preponderance of evidence suggests an important role for immunological responses. Some cutaneous eruptions appear shortly after drug intake, while others are not manifested until 7 to 10 days after initia tion of therapy and are consistent with delayed-type hypersensitivity. This review discusses critical steps in the initiation of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions in the skin, which include prot ein haptenation, dendritic cell activation/migration and T-cell propagation. Recently, an alternative mechanism of drug presentation has been postulated that does not require bioactivati on of the parent drug or antigen processing to elicit a drug-specific T-cell response. This review also discu sses the role of various immune-mediators, such as cy tokines, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species, in the development of delayed-type drug hypersensitivity reactions in skin. As ke ratinocytes have been shown to play a crucial role in the initiation and propagation of cutaneous immune responses, we also discuss the means by which these cells may initiate or modulate CDRs. REVIEW: Khalili B Pathogenesis and recent therapeutic trends in Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 2006;272-80 OBJECTIVE: To review the current pathophysiologi c mechanisms and recent therapeutic trends in Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epid ermal necrolysis (TEN). DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search for SJS and TEN in combination with Fas, Fas ligand (FasL), cytotoxic T cells, intravenous immunoglobulin, and cyclosporine for articles published in English during 1966 to 2006. STUDY SELECTION: Informati on was derived from original research articles and reviews published in peer-reviewed journals. RESULTS: The hallmark of SJS and TEN is epidermal cell apoptosis, which may be mediated through keratinoc yte Fas-FasL interacti on or through cytotoxic T-cell release of perfor in and granzyme B. Whereas system ic corticosteroid therapy showed contradictory results, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and cyclosporine have shown promising outcomes. IVIG contains anti-Fas antibodies that can abrogate apoptosis when preincubated with keratinocytes. Most studies on IVIG in SJS and TEN reported improvement in arresting disease progression and reduction in time to skin heali ng. Because of variations among studies, the findings cannot be optimally compared. In general, mortality varied from 0% to 12% in studies that supported the use of IVIG and 25% to 41.7% in those that did not demonstrate a beneficial 240effect. Cyclosporine inhibits CD8 activation and thus may reduce epiderm al destruction. Relatively few case reports and 1 case series have been published regarding the use of cyclosporine in SJS and TEN. In general, cycl osporine was associated with a significant improvement in time to disease arrest and to co mplete reepithelization, w ith no reported fatalities. CONCLUSIONS: Both IVIG and cyclosporine have been associated with enhanced healing and better survival through inhibition of apoptosis. Multicenter, randomized, pl acebo-controlled trials using a standardized design are need ed to validate these findings. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Stur K Soluble FAS ligand: a discriminating feature between drug-induced skin eruptions and viral exanthemas. J Invest Derm 2007;127:802-7 The clinical spectrum of comprises ants like maculopapular rashes life-threatening as toxic necrolysis (TEN). Apoptosis of keratinocytes is a common histopathological feature of all these drug eruptions. As in skin lesions of TEN and Stevens- Johnson syndrome patients, apoptos is of keratinocytes is often accompanied by an only sparse cellular infiltrate, a soluble fatty acid s ynthetase ligand (sFASL)- mediated mechanism of keratinoc yte cell death is postu lated. In MPR patients, evidence for the occurrence of a similar process co uld not be established so far. We therefore examined sera and lesional skin sections from patients with clinical variants of drug eruptions for FASL expression using a sandwich ELISA and immunohistochemistr y, respectively. As controls, healthy persons and patients with other inflammato ry skin diseases such as vira l exanthema were nalyzed.Elevated levels of FASL were detected not only in TEN patients but also in se ra and lesional skin of patients with MPR. In contrast, sFASL was repeatedly negative in all viral ex anthemas and healthy controls tested. Thus, determina tion of sFASL serum concentrati on may represent a discriminating tool between drug rashes and viral exanthemas. d. Aspirin and NSAID reactions REVIEW: Stevenson DD, Szczeklik A Clinical and pathologic perspectives on aspirin sensitivity and asthma. J Allergy Clin Immunology 2006:118:773-786 Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammato ry drugs that inhibit COX-1 induce unique nonallergic reactions, consisting of attacks of rhinitis and asthma. These hypersensitivity reactions occur in a subset of asthmatic s ubjects, thus identifying them as having this exclusive clinical presentation. We refer to these patients as having aspirin-exacerbated respir atory disease, a disease process that produces devast ating eosinophilic inflammation of both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. This review focuses on a description of patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, methods available to dia gnose their condition, the unique ability of all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit COX-1 to cross- react with aspirin, an update on pathogenesis, and curren t thoughts about treatment.

Reactions to Vaccines REVIEW: Madaan A, Maddox DE: Vaccine allergy: diagnosis and management. Immunol Allergy Clin N Am 2003:23:555-88. As a group, vaccines provide a safe and effective wa y of preventing infectious and allergic illness. Allergic reactions to vaccines and drug products have become im portant and common features of practice and demand heightened awareness. Serious adverse effects of vaccines are rare but have been reported to various components of diffe rent vaccines. Although there are few precise diagnostic tests available, patients usually can be diagnosed accurately after careful attention to the history and physical findings. Better understanding of these reactions can lead to proper vaccine selection and can improve immunization accep tance rates in the community. Prevention, avoidance, use of alternative ag ents, desensitization, and premedi cation remain the mainstays of therapy, even as more refined diagnostic and management tools are developed. VAERS data, in addition to the traditional uses (s ignal detection, large registry of rare vaccine adverse events), can serve as a source of cases for epid emiologic (eg, case-contro l) studies that evaluate biologic factors that may be related to vaccine-related adverse reactions. Additional studies that are aimed at identifying other causes of immediate hypersensi tivity after immunization w ith live virus vaccines are warranted. REVIEW: Siegrist C.-A. Mechanisms Underlying Adverse Reactions to Vaccines J Comp Path 2007:137:546-550 A broad spectrum of adverse events is reporte d following human vaccination but such reactions are considered to be relatively rare. A variety of mechanisms ha s been proposed to account for such adverse events. These most commonly relate to the actual process of vaccination and range from the vagal reaction associated with anxiety a bout needle injection, to use of an inappropriate site of administration, or infection of the health care worker by accidental injection during needle- capping. Other adverse events directly associated with the vaccine include reversion to virulence of attenuated vaccine strains of organisms, or contamination of the vaccine product. Adverse events may involve immune-mediated phenomena tri ggered by exposure to the microbial or other components of vaccines. These include: classical IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reactions, and immune-complex type III hypersensitivity (Arthus) reactions. Such reactions may be localized or systemic in nature. A variety of autoimmune reactions has been suggested to be triggered by vaccination, but in general the ev idence for such associations remains largely anecdotal. Finally, many reported adverse events are simply chance in stances of infection or disease onset around the time of vaccination and are not causally asso ciated with administration of vaccine. REVIEW: Nokleby and anaphylaxis Curr Allergy Asthma Rep 2006;6:9-13 242The incidence of anaphylactic or se ve re allergic reactions to vaccines is very low, less than one case per million vaccine doses. Larger studies from later years report no deaths. The cause of the reaction is usually not the immunizing antigen itself, but rather some other vaccine ingredient such as egg protein from the production process or gelatin added as a stabilizer. Most people with egg allergy can be vaccinated without any reac tion. Vasovagal reactions with or without hyperventilation are common after v accination. They can be rather dramatic and are often istaken for anaphylactic reactions. Correct diagnosis is important in maki ng it possible to vaccinate those who might otherwise run the ri sk of serious infections. REVIEW: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System http://vaers.hhs.gov/ The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is a cooperative program for vaccine safety of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (C DC) and the Food and Dr ug Administration (FDA). VAERS is a post-marketing safety surveillance program, collecting information about adverse events (possible side effects) th at occur after the administration of US licensed vaccines. This Web site provides a nationwide mechanism by which adverse events following immunization (AEFI) may be reported, analyzed and made available to the public. The VAERS Web site also provides a vehicle for disseminating vaccine safety-related information to parents/guardians, healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, state vaccine programs, and other constituencies. f. Photoallergy, phototoxicity, drug fever, and serum sickness reactions REVIEW: Moore DE. Drug-induced cutaneous photosensitivity: incidence, mechanism, prevention and management. Drug Safety 2002;25:345-72. The interaction of sunlight with drug medication leads to photosensi tivity responses in susceptible patients, and has the potential to increase the incidence of skin cancer. Adverse photosensitivity responses to drugs occur predominantly as a phot otoxic reaction which is more immediate than photoallergy, and can be revers ed by withdrawal or substitution of the drug. The bias and inaccuracy of the reporting procedure for these adve rse reactions is a consequence of the difficulty in distinguishing between sunburn and a mild drug photosensitivity reacti on, together with the patient being able to control the incidence by taking protectiv e action. The drug classes that currently are eliciting a high level of adverse pho tosensitivity antibacterial and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Photosensitising chemicals usually have a low molecular weight (200 to 500 Daltons) and are planar , tricyclic, or polycycli c configurations, often with heteroatoms in their structures enabling reso nance stabilisation. All absorb ultraviolet (UV) and/or visible radiation, a characte ristic that is essent ial for the chemical to be regarded as a photosensitiser. The photochemical and photobi ological mechanisms underlying the adverse reactions caused by the more photoactive drugs are mainly free radical in nature, but reactive oxygen species are also involved. Dr ugs that contain chlorine subs tituents in their chemical structure, such as hydrochlorthiazide, furose mide and chlorpromazine , exhibit to the UV-induced dissocia tion of the chlorine substituent leading to free radical reactions with lipids, proteins and DNA. The photochemical mechanisms for the NSAIDs 243that contain the 2-aryl p ropionic acid group invol ve decarboxylation as the primary step, with subsequent free radical activity. In aerated systems, th e reactive excited singlet form of oxygen is produced with high efficiency. This form of oxygen is highly reactive toward s lipids and proteins. NSAIDs without the 2-arylpropi onic acid group are also photo active, but with differing mechanisms leading to a less severe biological outcome. In the antibacterial drug class, the tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides ar e the most photoactive. Photocontact dermatitis due to topically applied agents interacting with s unlight has been reported for some sunscreen and cosmetic ingredients, as well as local anaes thetic and anti-acne agents. Prevention of photosensitivity involves adequate protection fr om the sun with clothing and sunscreens. In concert with the preponderance of free radical mechanisms involving the photosensitising drugs, some recent studies suggest that diet supplemen tation with antioxidants may be beneficial in increasing the minimum erythemal UV radiation dose. REVIEW: Stein KR Drug-induced Drug-induced photosensitivity involv es reactions to medication triggered by exposure of the skin to ultraviolet light. Medications that trigger reacti ons can be topical or oral. Following interaction of ultraviolet radiation with a ch emical present in sufficient amounts in the skin, one of the several reactions may occur in susceptible patients, mo st commonly photoallergy or phototoxicity. These reactions can be diagnosed separately based on pathogenesis, clinical characteristics and histopathology. Phototoxic disorders have a higher incidence than photoallergic disorders. The action spectra for most photoaller gens and phototoxins lie in the ultraviolet A range. of drug-induced photosensitivity include dyschro Drug fever Inf Dis Clin N Amer 1996;10:85-91. Drug fever is the febrile respons e to a drug without cutaneous ma nifestations. Although the exact incidence of drug fever remains unknown, it has been estimated to occur in approximately 10% of inpatients. The recognition of drug fever is of gr eat clinical importance b ecause, if drug fever is not recognized diagnostically, patients may be subjected to prolonged hospitalization and unnecessary testing or medications. Early diagnosis and treatment of drug fevers are essential in maintaining cost-effective, highquality medical care. REVIEW: Brychan M Severe Serum to Oral and Intramuscular Penicillin Pharmacotherapy 2006:26:705-08 Serum sickness is a type III hypersensitivity r eaction mediated by immune complex deposition with subsequent complement activation, small- vessel vasculitis, and tis sue inflammation. Although the overall incidence of serum sic kness is declining because of decr eased use of heterologous sera and improved vaccinations, rare sporadic cases of serum sickness from nonprotein drugs such as 244penicillins continue to occur. Drug-induced serum sickness is usua lly self-limited, with sym ptoms lasting only 1-2 weeks before resolving. We report an unusual case of a severe and prolonged serum sickness reaction that occurred after exposure to an intramus cular penicillin depot injection (probable relationship by Naranjo score) and di scuss how pharmacokinetics may have played a role. Clinicians should be familiar with serum sickness reactions particularly as they relate to long- acting penicillin preparations. A ccurate diagnosis in conjunction with cessation of drug exposure and prompt initiation of antiinflammatory treatm ent with corticosteroids can produce complete recovery. g. Clinical skills - specific testing and provocative challenges REVIEW: Romano A Recent advances in the diagnosis of drug allergy Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol 2007:7:299-303 The present review addresses the most recent literature re garding the diagnosis of drug hypersensitivity reactions, which can be classified as immediate or nonimmediate according to the time interval between the last drug administration and the onset. Immediate reactions occur within 1 h; nonimmediate ones occur after more than 1 h. Clinical and i mmunological studies suggest that type-I (IgE-mediated) and type-IV (cell-mediated ) pathogenic mechanisms are involved in most immediate and nonimmediate reactio ns, respectively. New diagnostic tools, such as the basophil activation test and the lymphocyte activation test, have been developed and are under validation. In diagnosis, the patient's history is fundamental; the allergologic examina tion includes in-vivo and in-vitro tests selected on the basis of the clinical features. Prick, patch, and intradermal tests are the most readily available forms of allergy testing. De termination of specific Ig E levels is still the most common in-vitro method for diagnosing immediate reactions. Th e sensitivity of allergologic tests is not 100%; in selected cases, therefore, provocation tests are nece ssary. The routine use of the basophil activation test and the lymphocyte activ ation test could increa se the sensitivity of diagnostic work-ups, thus reducing the need for drug provocation tests. REVIEW: Demoly P Anaphylactic reactions\u2014value of skin and provocation tests Toxicology April 2006:209: 221-223 Drug hypersensitivity reactions may affect up to 5% of hospitalised patients and can be life threatening. A variety of reacti on types have been described. Th ese include: (i) non-immunological reactions, (ii) IgE-mediated allergic reactions in the form of immediate anaphylactic shock, generalised urticaria, angioedema and/or broncho spasm, (iii) non-immediate allergic reactions (which may occur several days after the last drug has been administered) such as urticaria, maculopapular Johnson syndrome or drug reaction with eosinophili a and systemic symptoms. Reactions occurring within a few hours following the last administrati on of the drug may due to IgE-dependent or non- immunological mechanisms. The former could be lethal. The latter occur in only a small percentage of patients and in gene ral cannot be predicted. The etiol ogies of these reactions include non-specific histamine release (e by drug preparations containing sulphites). Moreover, som e reactions such as urticaria could even be not re lated to the drug itself, but to the underlying (e.g. infectious) disease. Therefore, a complete dr ug allergy work up is required, which includes a detailed clinical history and physical examin ation, followed by one or more of the following procedures: skin tests, laborator y tests and ultimately, drug provoca tion tests. This paper discusses the principles on the establishment of clinical tools for the daily practice. REVIEW: Aberer W Drug provocation testing in the diagnosis of drug hypersensitivity reactions: general considerations. Allergy 2003;58:854-63. A drug provocation test (DPT) is the controlled administration of a drug in order to diagnose drug hypersensitivity reactions. DPTs are performed under medical surveillance, whether this drug is an alternative compound, or structura lly/pharmacologically related, or the suspected drug itself. DPT is sometimes termed controlled challenge or reex posure , drug challenge , dosing , rechallenge , or testing for toleranc e. DPT is recommended by some specialized centers, alle rgy societies, and text books, wher eas other societies advise against performing DPTs , and some review articles and textbooks do not even mention the method. The topic DPT is controversial in general and the te st procedures not valida ted in most instances. Therefore it is considered important to devel op general guidelines for performing DPT. Specific protocols for every single drug or at least group of drugs would be helpful, where indication, contraindication, substance, dosing, gr ading of the reaction and test as well as scoring criteria are defined. However, the development of individual DPT protocols is impractical because of the countless drugs that may cause numerous kinds of hypersensitivity react ions, allergic and non- allergic, with different time courses, severity and outcome, the indivi dual situation of every person, and other factors that might possibly influence the test reac tion. This paper sets out general guidelines for DPT that can be adapted fo r the specific problem under investigation. REVIEW: Phillips JF Approach to patients with suspected hy persensitivity to local anesthetics Am J Med Sci 2007;334:190-6 Adverse reactions to local anesthetics are relatively common, but true IgE-mediated hypersensitivity is extremely rare. Fortunately, the vast majority of adverse reactions occur via nonimmunologic means, but considerable confusion still exists among providers. We conducted a review of the literature to determine if earlier es timates of IgE-mediated allergy are consistent with current reports and whether current management st rategies are consistent with these findings. We identified several confounding va riables involved in the evaluation, including the roles of preservatives/additives, epinephrine, latex, and inadequate testing pro cedures. These problems may cause significant diagnostic challenges for clinicia ns. It is in fact much more likely that there is an alternate diagnosis, and in many cases clinicians can begin the evaluation in the office. When local anesthetic allergy is still su spected, the patient should be referred to an allergist for testing to determine if the suspected culprit drug can be sa fely used, or, if necessary, identify a suitable alternative. 246REVIEW: Kelso J Immunization of egg allergic individuals wi th egg or chicken-derived vaccines Immunol Allergy Clin N Am 2003:23:635-48 Viruses used in several vaccines are propagate d in embryonated eggs.

REVIEW: Gollapudi Aspirin Sensitivity: Implications With Coronary Artery Disease JAMA 2004;292:3017-23 CONTEXT: Although acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is commonly used for patients with chronic cardiovascular disease, a minority of patients have a sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. OBJECTIV E: To provide a diagnostic strategy for evaluating and treating patients with aspirin sensi tivity, with additional consideration for issues specific to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Published articles were identified through a search of ME DLINE and the Cochrane databases using the dates 1966 to June 2004 and the search terms aspirin allergy, coronary artery disease, aspirin desensitization, and aspirin sensit ivity.

EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The prevalence of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory tract disease is a pproximately 10% and for aspirin- induced urticaria the prevalence varies from 0.07% to 0.2% of the general population. Aspirin sensitivity is most often manifested as rhini tis and asthma or urticar ia/angioedema induced by cross-reacting nonstero idal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase 1. The primary mechanism of sensitivity is less often related to drug- specific IgE antibody production leading to urticaria/angioedema and rarely to anaphylaxis. Most patients with acetylsalicylic acid sensitivity are able to undergo desensitization therapy safe ly and successfully except in cases of chronic idiopathic urticaria. However, there have not been any randomized trials that specifically focus on 247the efficacy of aspirin desensit ization. Furthermore, experience with acetylsalicylic ac id desensitization in patients with CAD is very limited. After successful desensitization, acetylsalicylic acid therapy must be indefi nitely continued to prevent resensitization. CONCLUSIONS: Acetylsalicylic acid sensitivity is common and desensitization can be performed safely in many patients. Large-scale trials are wa rranted to determine the safety and efficacy of acetylsalicylic acid desensitization therapy in pa tients with concomitant CAD because data are currently limited to small case series. REVIEW: Solensky R Drug Desensitization Immunol Allergy Clin N Am 2004;24:425-43 The term drug allergy is loosely applied to many drug reactions. Consequently, when properly evaluated, most patients who are labeled allergic are found to lack hypersens itivity and are able to tolerate the implicated medication. A proportion of patients who undergo a thorough evaluation by allergists/immunologists are determined to be drug allergic. Although the usual recommendation for allergic patients is to avoid the medication in question, some clinical situations may necessitate re-administration. This article focuses on th e approach to drug-allergic patients when administration of the sensitizing drug, or a cross-reacting one is required. REVIEW: Castells M Rapid Desensitization for hypersensitivi ty 2006;6:271-7 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to chemotherapy agents have limited their use for fear of inducing severe reactions or death. Alternative regimens may be limited by tumor sensitivity and the need to provide first-line therapy. Rapid desensitiz ations allow patients to be treated with medications to which they have pr esented a HSR. The purpose of this review is to highlight the indications and recent developments in chemotherapy rapid desensitization protocols. RECENT FINDINGS: Intravenous and oral rapid desensitizati on protocols are available for taxenes, platinums, doxorubicin, monoclonal anti bodies and others. Candidate patients present mild to severe type I hypersensit ivity, mast cell/IgE-dependent reac tions, as seen with platinums. Anaphylactoid reactions, such as those with taxene s, can be treated with the same protocols. Repeat desensitizations in outpatient settings are well tolerated and allow patients to remain in clinical studies/trials . Breakthrough symptoms during desensiti zations are less severe than the initial reaction and no deaths ha ve been reported. Cancer remi ssions are similar to those for nondesensitized patients. SUMMARY: The use of rapid desensitization protocols for cancer patients with HSRs to chemotherapy depends on th eir demonstrated tolerability and efficacy in selected populations. Education of nurses, pharm acists, and oncology and allergy specialists is needed to improve their universal application as standard of care.

Adverse reactions to ingestants a. Food sensitivities - IgE mediated, food intolerance, gluten sensitivity REVIEW: Food allergy: a practice 2): S1-68 REVIEW: J Med2008; 359(12): 1252-60. CUTTING EDGE: Sicherer, S. H. and H. A. Sampson. Food Allergy: Recent Advances in Pathophysiology and Treatment Annu Rev Med 2008 Food allergies, defined as an adverse immune res ponse to food proteins, affect as many as 6% of young children and 3%-4% of adults in westernized countries, and th eir prevalence appears to be rising. In addition to well-recogni zed acute allergic reactions a nd anaphylaxis triggered by IgE antibody-mediated immune responses to food proteins, th ere is an increasin g recognition of cell- mediated disorders such as eosi nophilic gastroenteropa thies and food protein- induced enterocolitis syndrome. are gaining an increasing understa nding of the pathophysiology of food allergic disorders and are beginning to comprehend how this disease results from a failure to establish or maintain normal oral tolerance. Many food allergens have been characterized at a molecular level, and this knowledge, combined with an increasi ng appreciation of the nature of humoral and cellular immune responses resulting in allergy or tolerance, is leading to novel therapeutic approaches. Currently, management of food allergie s consists of educating the patient to avoid ingesting the responsible allergen and initiating therapy if inges tion occurs. However, numerous strategies for definitive treatment are being studied, including sub lingual/oral immunotherapy, injection of anti-IgE antibodies, cy tokine/anticytokine therapies, Chinese herbal therapies, and novel immunotherapies utilizing engineered prot eins and strategic immunomodulators.

CUTTING EDGE: Burks, A. W., S. Laubach, et al. Oral tolerance, food allergy, and immunoth erapy: implications for future 1344-50. 249The lumen is exposed daily to an arra y of dietary proteins. The vast m ajority of proteins are tolera ted through suppression of cellular or humoral responses, a process known as oral tolerance. However, in approximately 6% of children and 4% of adults in the United States, tolerance to a given dietary antigen either is not established or breaks down, resulting in food hypersensitivity. Although food a llergies can result in sudden a nd life-threatening symptoms, their prevalence is remarkably low considering the complexities of the gut-associated mucosal system. Suppression involves signaling by an ar ray of nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells, dendritic cells, and regulatory T cells, as well as lymphocyte anergy or de letion. Several factors, including antigen properties, route of exposure, a nd genetics and age of th e host, contribute to the development of oral tolerance. Although the current standard of care for patients with food allergies is based on avoidance of the trigger, increased understanding of the mechanisms involved in tolerance has shifted focus of treatment and prevention toward inducing tolerance. Data from early-phase clinical trials sugge st both sublingual and oral immunotherapy are effective in reducing sensitivity to allergens. In this article we review the mechanisms of tolerance, discuss aberrations in oral tolerance, and provide information on novel pr evention and treatment paradigms for food allergy. REVIEW: Enrique, E. and A. Cistero-Bahima Specific immunotherapy for food allergy: basic principles 2006; 6(6): 466-9. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Food allergy may be life threatening and its management continues to consist of avoiding relevant allergens and, in the case of accidental i ngestion, initiation of appropriate emergency therapy. The aim of this arti cle is to describe curre nt treatment approaches and discuss attempts to use specific immunot herapy for food-allergy treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: A recent study reports the use of subl ingual immunotherapy for hazelnut food allergy in hazelnut-allergic patients. A significant increase in tolerance to hazelnuts after sublingual immunotherapy as assessed by double-blind, pl acebo-controlled food challenge, and good tolerance to this treatment, have been obser ved. SUMMARY: The purpose of this review is to highlight the most promising novel approaches for treating food allergy beyond allergen avoidance. Some of these approaches alone, such as traditional Chinese herbal medicine, anti- immunoglobulin E therapy or sublingual immunother apy for food allergy, or the combination of different approaches, would probably offer the best treatment option for food-allergic patients in the near future. REVIEW: Pajno, G. B. Sublingual immunotherapy: the optimism J Allergy Clin 2007; 119(4): 796-801. The acceptability of sublingual i mmunotherapy (SLIT) in guidelines or statements has recently increased. SLIT is currently used in Europe, As ia, and Australia for the treatment of allergic respiratory diseases. Four meta-analyses have sh own that SLIT is an effective tool for the treatment of patients with asthma and/or rhini tis, and only conflicting results were reported for children with allergic rhinitis. Moreover, it offers logistic advantages and is safe. However, some unmet needs are to be faced, such as the difficult y of manufacturers to ac hieve the homogeneity of standardized vaccines, the magnitude of their clin ical efficacy, and the pivotal question of an early 250intervention with SLIT in young children with Ig E-mediated disorders. Altogether, S LIT has already given convincing results in respiratory diseases both in a dults and children. In the future, this route of administration of allergic vaccines may improve even the treatment of patients with IgE-mediated food allergy. These patients indeed deserve better than allergen avoidance. The immunomodulatory treatment of allergic diseases probably has found a new tool; however, a more balanced understanding of this form of allergen immunotherapy is needed. This aim could be achieved through: (1) the improveme nt of products standardization quality; (2) an attempt to modify in children the natural course of allergic diseases; and (3) new research on mechanisms of action.

Food allergy and additives: triggers asthma Immunol Allergy Clin N Am 2005; 25; 149-167 Exposure to food allergens can cause a varied pa ttern of respiratory sy mptoms, with allergic responses ranging from asthma symptoms to occupational asthma. Food allergy in a patient presenting as asthma tends to indicate a more seve re disease constellation. Patients with underlying asthma experience more severe and life-threateni ng allergic food reactions . When a food reaction involves respiratory symptoms, it is almost always a more severe reaction co mpared with reactions that do not involve the respiratory tract.

The use of serum-specific IgE measurements for the diagnosis of peanut, tree nut, and seed allergy J Allergy Clin Immunol 2008; 122(1): 145-51. BACKGROUND: The gold ing food allergy is the double-blind, placebo- controlled food challenge. Diagnostic food-specific IgE levels might assist in diagnosing food allergies and circumventing the need for food challenges. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of food-specifi c IgE measurements for identifying symptomatic peanut, tree nut, and seed allergies and to augm ent what is known about the relationships among these foods. METHODS: Patients referred for suspect ed peanut or tree nut allergies answered a questionnaire about their perceived food allergie s. Allergen-specific di agnoses were based on questionnaire, medical history, and, when relevant, skin prick test s and serum specific IgE levels. Sera from the patients were analyzed for specific IgE antibodies to peanuts, tree nuts, and seeds by using ImmunoCAP Specific IgE (Phadia, Inc, Uppsala, Sweden). RESULTS: Three hundred patients (61% male; median age, 6.1 years; range, 0.2-40.2 year s) were evaluated. The patients were highly atopic (57% with atopic dermatitis and 58% with asthma). The majority of patients with peanut allergy were sensitized to tree nuts (86%), and 34% had documented clinical allergy. The relationship between diagnosis and allergen-specific IgE levels were estimated by using logistic regression. Di agnostic decision points are sugg ested for peanut and walnut. Probability curves were drawn for peanut, sesame , and several tree nuts. High correlations were found between cashew and pistachio and between pecan and walnut. CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of food-specific IgE is a valuable tool that will aid in the diagnosis of symptomatic food allergy and might decrease the need fo r double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges. REVIEW: Niggemann, B. and K. Beyer oral food challenges 62(7): 729-32. Although controlled oral food challe nges are considered to be the gol d-standard in the diagnosis of food related symptoms, especia lly if performed in a double- blind, placebo-controlled food 252challenges (DBPCFC) manner, there are s till many unanswered questions and newer aspects, which may explain some pitfalls encountered du ring oral food challenges. For stopping an oral food challenge and declaring a challenge as positive or negative, symptoms should be objective and/or repetitive. The time interval between administering the food a nd observing the clinical reaction is an ambivalent factor. Possible reasons for false negative assessments include inadvertent drug use during oral challenges, and the fact that a short-term specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI) may be induced as increasing amounts of the offended food are administered during a titrated oral food challenge. Possible reasons for fals e positive assessments are the difficulty to maintain an appropria te strict diet throughout the oral challenge procedure, and that the elimination diet implemented before the oral food challenge in children with atopic eczema and suspected food related symptoms ma y itself be responsible for immediate type clinical symptoms, which had not been reported by the parents before. Finally augmentation factors are among the most plausible explanations for the inadequate re producibility of an oral food challenge. Although a 100% standardization of the chal lenge procedure does not seem rea listic, efforts should be made to improve the methodology used so far. On the contrary, the possible re lation of DBPCFC and SOTI may offer potential advant ages for future therapeutic approaches of food allergy. 7.

The authors examine evidence for the role of epinephrine in the treatment of anaphylaxis, especially focusing on the risk vs. benefit of use and many of the factors that might influence the decision to use it. They conclude that epin ephrine is currently underutilized and dosed suboptimally and that therapeutic be nefits exceed the risk when epinephrine is provided for acute anaphylaxis.

The researchers found no high qua lity evidence on whic h to offer any new recommendations on the use of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis. They posit that randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of high methodological quality ar e unlikely to be performed in individuals with anaphylaxis and indeed might be unethical because prompt treatment with epinephrine is deemed to be critically important for surviv al in anaphylaxis. They also acknowledge that such studies would be diffi cult to conduct because anaphylactic episodes \"usually occur without warning, often in a non-medi cal setting, and differ in severity both among individuals and from one epis ode to another in the same individual\". Accordingly, they recommend that intramuscular epinephrine inject ions should still be re garded as first-line treatment for the management of anaphylaxis.

Insect Hypersensitivity REVIEW: Golden DBK Insect sting allergy and venom i mmunotherapy: A model and a mystery J Allergy Clin Immunol 2005;115:439-447 255Allergic reactions to stingi ng insects of the order Hymenopt era have been recognized for millennia, but only in the last century have they b een subject to scientific investigation. Since we began our investigations at Johns Hopkins more than 30 years ago, the diagnosis and treatment of insect sting allergy has been view ed as a model in many ways.1 As a model of anaphylaxis, insect sting allergy illustrates most of the dilemmas in the immunology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and prevention of anaphylaxis. This condition and its treatment have also been a model for the use of standardized allergens, a model for allergen challenge pro cedures, and a model for the study and application of immunotherapy. After 3 decades, this model has lived up to many of these expectations, but some mysteries remain. REVIEW: Freeman TM Hypersensitivity to Hymenoptera Stings N Engl J Med 2004;351:1978-84 Insects of the order Hymenoptera, which includes ants, bees, hornets, wasps, and yellow jackets, have a stinging apparatus at the tail end of their abdominal segment and are capable of delivering between 100 ng (fire ants) and 50 \u00b5g (bees) of venom. Although the venoms have various peptide and protein components, some of which are capable of inducing toxic or vasoactive responses, it has been estimated that about 1500 stings would be required to deliver a lethal dose of hymenoptera venom for a nonallergic adult who weighs 70 kg. Despite this estimate, about 40 deaths a year are attributed to hymenoptera stings; these deat hs are ascribed to anaphylaxis occurring in persons with a history of prior stings in whom specific IgE antibodies developed to various venom components. PRACTICE PARAMETER GUIDELINE: Moffitt JE, Golden 2004;114:869 -886 This parameter was developed by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters, representing the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunol ogy; the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. The objective of ''Stinging insect hypersensitivity: A practice paramete r update'' is to improve the care for patients with stinging insect hypersensitivity. This parameter is intended to refine guidelines for the use and interpretation of diagnostic methods and for th e institution and implemen tation of measures to manage stinging insect hypersensitivity, with particular emphasis on the appropriate use of immunotherapy. LANDMARK PUBLICATION: Hunt KJ, Valentine MD , Sobotka AK et al A controlled trial of immunotherapy insect hypersensitivity rrently treated by immunization using whole-body extracts. We compared this regimen with immunotherapy using insect venoms or placebo in groups of 20 patients matched for history and sensitivity, as judged by venom skin test, histamine release and IgE antibody to venom. After six to 10 weeks of immunization, systemic reactions to stings occurred in seven of 12, seven of 11, and one of 18 patients treated with placebo, whole-body 256extract, and venom, respectively. Placebo and wholebody extract gave sim ilar results and were significantly less effective than venom im munotherapy (P less than 0.01). The 14 patients with failure of treatment with wholebody extract and placebo were subsequently provided with venom immunotherapy; one reacted to a subsequent sting. We conclude that venom immunotherapy is clinically superior to therapy on whole-body extract or placebo.

Although little is known about the pathogenesis of these reactions, wine contains many biologic and chemical components derive d from grapevines, yeast, bacteria, and insects (i ncluding those of the order Hymenoptera) that might explain the observed symp toms. We report on five patients who presented with symptoms after drinking grape juice or newly pr essed wines (both red and white). Three of the patients had an or al allergy syndrome and facial flushing, one had asthmatic symptoms, and one had anaphylaxis. Skin tests with conventional allergens, including commercial grape extract, egg white, and wines aged for up to 1 year, were negative. None of the patients had a history of ingesting drugs containing sulfites that was conc omitant with these symptoms, nor had any of them been stung by Hymenoptera species. Yet all had positive skin tests for specific IgE antibodies (levels >0.35 kU per liter, CAP, Phadia) to Hymenoptera ( Apis mellifera and vespula and polistes species) and to an extract of the wine or grape juice under suspicion for causing the symptoms. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Akdis CA. Blesken T. Akdis M et al Role of interleukin 10 in specific immunotherapy J Clin Invest. 1998;102:98-106. The induction of allergen-specific anergy in periph eral T cells represents a key step in specific immunotherapy (SIT). Here we demonstrate that the anergic state results from increased IL-10 production. In bee venom (BV)-SIT the specific prolifer ative and cytokine responses against the main allergen, the phospholipase A2 (PLA), and T cell epitope-containing PLA peptides were significantly suppressed after 7 d of treatment. Simultaneously, the production of IL-10 increased during BV-SIT. After 28 d of BV-SIT the anergic st ate was established. Intracytoplasmic cytokine staining of PBMC combined with surface marker detection revealed that IL-10 was produced initially by activated CD4(+)CD25(+), allergen-specific T cells, and followed by B cells and monocytes. Neutralization of IL- 10 in PBMC fully reconstituted the specific proliferative and cytokine responses. A similar state of IL-10-associated T cell anergy, as induced in BVSIT, was 257found in hyperimmune individuals who recently had received multiple bee stings. The addition of IL-10 to soluble CD40 ligand IL-4-stimulated PBMC or purifie d B cells inhibited the PLA- specific and total IgE and enhanced the IgG4 formation. Accordingly, increased IL-10 production by SIT causes specific anergy in peripheral T cells, and regulates specific IgE and IgG4 production toward normal IgG4-related immunity. a.

Skin prick, intradermal and in vitro testing to stinging insects REVIEW: Bil Rueff F, Mosbech H, Group on Insect Venom Hypersensitivity Diagnosis of Hymenoptera venom allergy Allergy 2005;60:1339-1349 The purpose of diagnostic procedure is to clas sify a sting reaction by history, identify the underlying pathogenetic mechanism, and identify the offending insect. Diagnosis of Hymenoptera venom allergy thus forms the basis for the treatmen t. In the central and northern Europe vespid (mainly Vespula spp.) and honeybee stings are the most prevalent, wherea s in the Mediterranean area stings from Polistes and Vespula are more frequent than honeybee stings; bumblebee stings are rare throughout Europe and more of an occupa tional hazard. Several ma jor allergens, usually glycoproteins with a molecular weight of 10-50 kDa, have been identified in venoms of bees, vespids. and ants. The sequences and structures of the majority of veno m allergens have been determined and several have been expressed in r ecombinant form. A particular problem in the field of cross-reactivity are specific immunoglobu lin E (IgE) antibodies directed against carbohydrate epitopes, which may induce multiple positive test resu lts (skin test, in vitro tests) of still unknown clinical significance. Venom hypersensitivity may be mediated by immunologic mechanisms (IgE- mediated or non-IgE-mediated venom allerg y) but also by nonimmunologic mechanisms. Reactions to Hymenoptera stings ar e classified into normal local reactions, large local reactions, systemic toxic reactions, systemic anaphylactic reactions, and unusual reactions. For most venom- allergic patients an anaphylactic reaction after a sting is very traumatic event, resulting in an altered health-related quality of life. Risk fact ors influencing the outco me of an anaphylactic reaction include the time interval between stings, the number of stings, the severity of the preceding reaction, age, cardiovascular diseases and drug intake, insect type, elevated serum tryptase, and mastocytosis. Diagnosti c tests should be carried out in a ll patients with a history of a systemic sting reaction to detect sensitization. They are not recommended in subjects with a history of large local reaction or no history of a systemic reaction. Testing comprises skin tests with Hymenoptera venoms and analysis of the serum for Hymenoptera venom-specific IgE. Stepwise skin testing with incremental venom c oncentrations is recommended. If diagnostic tests are negative they should be repeat ed several weeks later. Serum tryptase should be analyzed in patients with a history of a severe sting reaction. 258INVESTIGATION: Sturm GJ, Heinemann A, Schuster C, et al. Influence of total IgE levels on the severity of sting reactions in Hymenoptera venom allergy Allergy 2007: 62: 884-889 Background: Detection of sp ecific IgE for Hymenoptera venoms and skin tests are well established diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of insect venom hypersensitivity. The aim of our study was to analyze the effect of total IgE le vels on the outcome of generalized anaphylactic reactions after a Hymenoptera sting. Methods: Two hundred and twenty pa tients allergic to bee, wasp, or European hornet venom were included in the study. Their specific a nd total IgE levels, serum tryptase levels, skin tests, and sting history were analyzed. Resu lts: In patients with mild reactions (grade I, generalized skin symptoms) we observed higher tota l IgE levels (248.0 kU/l) compared to patients with moderate reactions (grade II, moderate pulmonary, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal symptoms; 75.2 kU/l) and severe reactions (gra de III, emesis, anaphylactic shock, or loss of consciousness; 56.5 kU/l; P < 0.001). Accordingly, 25% of the patients with low levels of total IgE (<50 kU/l), but no individual with total IgE leve ls >250 kU/l, developed loss of consciousness ( P = 0.001). Additionally, specific IgE levels were related to total IgE levels: Specific IgE levels increased from 1.6 to 7.1 kU/l in patients with low (<50 kU/l) and high (>250 kU/l) total IgE levels, respectively ( P < 0.001). Specific IgE le vels correlated inversely to the clinical reaction grades, however , this trend was not statistically significant ( P = 0.083). Conclusion: Patient s with Hymenoptera venom allergy and high levels (>250 kU/l) of total IgE, predominantly develop grade I and grade II reactions and appear to be protected from grade III reactions. However, this hypothesis should be confirmed by extended studies with sting challenges.

Objective: Our aim is to in crease awareness about the patient with a negative skin test res ponse and insect sting allergy and to determine the frequency and significance of negative skin test resp onses in patients with a history of systemic reactions to insect stings. Methods: We prospectively examined the pr evalence of negative venom skin test responses in patients with a history of systemic reactions to stings. In patients who gave informed consent, we analyzed the outcome of retesting and sting challenge. Results: Of 307 patients with positive histories screened for our sting challenge study, 208 (68%) had positive venom skin test responses (up to 1 g/mL concentration), and 99 (32%) had nega tive venom skin test responses. In 36 (36%) of the 99 patients with negative skin test res ponses, the venom RAST result was a low positive (1- 3 ng/mL), or repeat venom skin test responses were positive; another 7 (7%) patients had high venomspecific IgE antibody levels (4-243 ng/mL). No tably, 56 (57%) of 99 patients with positive histories and negative skin test responses had nega tive RAST results. In patients with po sitive skin test responses, sting challenges we re performed in 141 of 196 patients, with 30 systemic reactions. Sting challenges were performed on 37 of 43 patients with negative skin test responses and positive venom-specific IgE and in 14 of 56 patients with negative skin test responses and negative 259RAST results. There were 11 patients with negative skin test responses who had systemic reactions to the challe nge sting: 2 had negative RAST results, and 9 had positive RAST results at 1 ng/mL. The frequency of systemic reaction was 21% in patients with positive skin test responses and 22% in patients with negative skin test responses (24% in those with positive RAST results and 14% in those with negative RAST results. Conclusions: Venom skin test responses can be negative in patients who will subsequently experience another systemic sting reaction. Venom skin test responses are negative in many patients with a history of systemic allergic reactions to insect stings and may be associated with positive serologic test responses for venom-specific IgE antibodies (sometimes strongly positive results). Venom skin test respons es should be repeated when negative, along with a serologic IgE antiveno m test. Better diagnostic sk in test reagents are urgently needed. LANDMARK PUBLICATION: Golden DBK, Marsh DG, Freidhoff LR, et al. Natural history of Hymenoptera venom in adults J Allergy Clin Immunol 1997;100:760-6 Background: Epidemiologic studies of Hymenoptera venom allergy in adults show a prevalence of positive venom skin test results, RASTs of 15% to 25%, or both, but most such individuals have had no systemic reactions to stings. The clinical significance and natural hist ory of this apparently common sensitivity is uncertain. Objective: We s ought to determine the natural history of venom sensitization by observing the rate of decrease or increase in sensitivity in normal adults over 5 to 10 years. The clinical significance of these findings is related to the frequency of systemic reactions to stings during the period of observation. Methods: Serial observations were planned in 520 volunteers and randomly selected subjects. Two follow-up visits were attempted , once after 2 to 3 years and again after 5 to 9 years, to pe rform repeat venom skin tests and RASTs and to review any history of interim stings and their outcomes. Results: Follow-up visits were conducted with 398 subjects (375 early visits and 205 late visits). Overall, in the 398 subjects with one or more visits after a mean of 4 years, skin test responses changed from positive to negative in 44 of 98 (45%) and from negative to positive in 27 of 309 (8.7%) of the subjects. Skin test responses changed from positive to negative in 29 of 87 (33%) subjects after 2.5 years and in 43 of 54 (80%) after 6.8 years. Even when the skin test respons e became negative, venom-specific IgE remained positive in 11 of 29 (38%) subjects after 2.5 years and in 13 of 43 (30%) af ter 6.8 years. The rate of loss of sensitivity was 12% per year, similar to retrospective estimates. Skin test sensitivity to venoms disappears more rapidly in these subjects without symptoms (half-lif e, 4 years) than in patients receiving venom immunotherapy (half-life, 7 years). Skin test responses changed from negative to positive in 23 of 288 (8%) subjects after 2.5 years and in 9 of 151 (6%) after 6.8 years. Insect stings caused no reaction in 120 subjects with a negative skin test response, but 17% (11 of 65) of subjects with a positive skin test response (but with a negative history) had systemic reactions when stung. There was no difference between the early and late visits in the frequency of systemic reactions reported. The ri sk may be higher than 17% for the specific individuals (67% after 2.5 years and 20% after 6.8 years) whose positiv e skin test responses persist for years. This risk is lower than that of patients with a positiv e history (50%) but higher than that of \"normal\" adults or venomtreated patients (< 2%). It is still not clear whether any subset of adults with a positive skin test response but a negative history can be identified, in whom the risk of systemic sting reaction would justify venom immunotherapy even before a ny reaction occurs. Conclusion: Asymptomatic venom sensitization in adults is co mmon but transient, disapp earing at the rate of 26012% per year. However, the risk of a systemic reacti on to a subsequent sting is significant in adults without symp toms but with positive venom skin test responses (17%) and may be higher when skin test sensitivity does persist for years. c. Predictive value of clinical hist ory and testing for adult and pediatric population REVIEW: Moffitt JE, Golden DBK, Reisman RE Stinging 2004;114:869 -886 This parameter was developed by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters, representing the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and I mmunology; the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; and the Joint C ouncil of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology LANDMARK PUBLICATION: Outcomes of Allergy to Insect Stings in Ch ildren, with and without Venom Immunotherapy Golden DBK, Kagey-Sobotka A, Norman PS, Hamilton RG, Lichtenstein LM N Engl J Med 2004:351;668-74. Background - Children are thought to \"outgrow\" the allergy to insect stings, but there are no reports documenting the natural history of this reaction. We studied the outcome of allergic reactions to insect stings in childhood 10 to 20 years afterward in patients who had not received venom immunotherapy and in those who had b een treated. Methods - Between 1978 and 1985, we diagnosed allergic reaction to insect stings in 1033 childre n, of whom 356 received venom immunotherapy. We conducted a survey of these patients by telephone and mail between January 1997 and January 2000, to determine the outcome of s tings that occurred in the period from 1987 through 1999. Results - Of the 1033 patients, 512 patients (50 percent) responded, with a mean follow-up period of 18 years, a mean duration of venom immunotherapy of 3.5 years in treated patients, and an incidence of stings of 43 percen t. Systemic reactions occurred less frequently in patients who had received venom immunotherapy (2 of 64 patients, or 3 percent) than in untreated patients (19 of 111 patients, or 17 percent; P=0.0 07). Patients - with a history of moderate-to- severe reactions had a higher rate of reaction if they had not been treated (7 of 22 patients, or 32 percent) than if they had rece ived venom immunotherapy (2 of 43 patients, or 5 percent; P=0.007). In patients who had been treated and who had a hi story of mild (cutaneous ) systemic reaction (i.e., one with only cutaneous manifestations), none of the 21 subjects who received stings had a systemic reaction. Conclusions - A clinically impo rtant number of children do not outgrow allergic reactions to insect sti ngs. Venom immunotherapy in children l eads to a significantly lower risk of systemic reaction to stings even 10 to 20 year s after treatment is stopped, and this prolonged benefit is greater than th e benefit seen in adults. d. History positive, test neg, stinging insect reactive patient . REVIEW: Freeman TM. Hoffma n DR. Insect Committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Negative venom skin test results in patients wi th histories of system ic reaction to a sting. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2003;112:495-8. 261For more than 20 years venom immunotherapy has been the preferred treatment for Hymenoptera allergy and venom skin testing th e preferred diagnostic test. Most allergists consider venom skin tests to be highly accurate and interpret a negative venom skin test result to indicate the absence of insect allergy. Furthermore, current practice guid elines do not adequately address the question of how best to manage the patient w ith a convincing history of insect allergy but negative skin test results. Recent case reports and published studies have forced us to reexamine this important management issue and to consider what role in vitro venom testi ng might have in the management of insect allergy. We reviewed the current stat us of what is known about the management of individuals with a history of in sect allergy but negative venom sk in test results and suggested modifications of current working guidelines. e.

REVIEW: Moffitt JE, Golden 2004;114:869 -886 This parameter was developed by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters, representing the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and I mmunology; the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; and the Joint C ouncil of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology REVIEW: Bonifazi Interest Venom Hypersensitivity Prevention and treatment of hymenoptera venom allergy: guidelines for clinical practice Allergy 2005;60: 1459-1470 Based on the knowledge of the livin g conditions and habitat of so cial Aculeatae a series of recommendations have been formulated which can pot entially greatly minimize the risk of field re- sting. After a systemic sting reaction, patients sh ould be referred to an allergy specialist for evaluation of their allergy, and if necessary venom immunotherapy (VIT). An emergency medical kit should be supplied, its use clearly demonstrated and repeatably practised until perfected. This should be done under the supervision of a doctor or a trained nurs e. Epinephrine by intramuscolar injection is regarded as the treatment of choice for acute anaphylaxis. H1-antihistamines alone or in combination with corticosteroids may be effectiv e in mild to moderate reactions confined to the skin and may support the value of treatment with epinephrine in full-blown anaphylaxis. Up to 75% of the patients with a history of systemic anaphylactic sting reaction develop systemic symptoms once again when re-stung. Venom immunotherapy is a highly effective treatment for individuals with a history of sy stemic reaction and who have speci fic IgE to venom allergens. The efficacy of VIT in yellow jacket venom allergic patients has been demonstrated also by assessing healthrelated quality of life. If both skin tests and serum venom specific IgE turn negative, VIT may be stopped after 3 years. Afte r VIT lasting 3-5 years, most pa tients with mild to moderate anaphylactic symptoms remain protected following discontinuation of VIT even with positive skin tests. Longer term or lifelong treatment should be considered in high-risk patients. Because of the small but relevant risk of re-sting reactions, in these patients, emergency kits, including epinephrine auto-injectors, should be discu ssed with every patient when stopping VIT. 262LANDMARK PUBLICATION: Freeman TM, Hylander R, Ortiz A, Martin ME Imported fire ant immunotherapy:m Effe ctiv eness of whole body extracts J Allergy Clin Immunol 1992:90;210-5 The purpose of this study was to determine if whole body extract (WBE) immunotherapy for Imported fjre ant (IFA) hypersensitivity is effective. This evalua tion was carried out by retrospectively interviewing 76 patients with a hi story of generalized allergic reactions to IFA stings and positive skin tests to IFA-WB E. The study groups consisted of 65 patients onimmunotherapy and 11 similar patients who were not treated for various reasons. In addition, an IFA sting challenge was performed in 30 volunteers of the 65 patients on immunotherapy. The retrospective review showed that of the 65 patients on immunotherapy there had been 112 Subsequent field-sting episodes in 47 patients. Only one stin g episode in this group (2.1%) produced an anaphylactic reac tion. Six of the 11 patients not on immunotherapy have had subsequent field re-sting episodes, and each has ha d a systemic reaction. Repeat skin testing on 31 of the 65 patients in the immunothe rapy group showed persistent positive responses in five (16%), but each was at a lower dilution th an initially. Responses of the ot her 26 of the 31 patients who had skin testing had become negative. The four untreated patients who were available for skin testing continued to have positive respons es at comparable dilutions on skin testing. Sting challenges carried out on 30 volunteers from the 65 patients (all from the 31 who had repeat skin tests) on immunotherapy resulted in only local reactions. Th erefore it appears IFA- WBE is effective in decreasing the incidence of anaphylaxis during subsequent field stings; reducing specific immunoglobulin E as demonstrated by skin testi ng; and protecting against systemic reactions provoked by a sting challenge with a single IFA. LANDMARK PUBLICATION: Golden DBK, Kagey-Sobotka A, Lichtenstein LM Survey of patients discontinuing immunotherapy J Allergy Clin Immunol 2000;105:385-90 Background: Venom immunotherapy rapidly reduces the risk of a systemic s ting reaction in adults from 30% to 70% to less than 2%. When venom immunotherapy is stopped after 5 years or longer, the risk of a systemic sting reaction is 5% to 15% during the first few years after stopping treatment. It is uncertain whether systemic s ting reactions will occur more than 5 years after discontinuing venom immunotherapy and whethe r treatment can be safely stopped in some patients after less than 5 years. Objective: The purpose of this study is to estimate the risk of systemic reaction to a sting 10 years after disconti nuing treatment and the relative risk after 3 years of treatment compared with that after 5 years or more of treatment. Methods: Among all patients who had venom immunotherapy at our center, we identified 395 patients who stopped treatment: some had dropped out of therapy early (6-24 months ), some stopped after 3 to 4 years, and most completed 5 years or more of venom immunothe rapy and were advised to stop by the allergist (many as part of our reported studies of di scontinuing venom immunotherapy). Results: Contact was made with 194 patients, including telephone inte rviews for sting history and requests to visit the office for skin testing and blood sampling. Of these patients, 74 had been included in our original study of patients who had 5 years or more of venom immunotherapy and had sting challenges after 1 to 5 years off venom immunothe rapy, as previously reported. Of the 74 in that original study, 61 were reached for this survey, a nd 30 reported recent stings, with 5 systemic sting reactions. Another 133 patients w ho had stopped venom immunotherapy were reached: 82 had 5 or 263more years of venom immunotherapy, 20 had 3 to 4 years of venom immunotherapy, and 31 had less than 2 years of venom immunotherapy. Of 51 patients stung from this group, 27 had 5 or more years of venom immunotherapy (no systemic sting reactions), and 24 had less than 5 years of venom immunotherapy (3 systemic sting reactions). We have now observed a total of 113 patients who had 5 or more years of venom immunothe rapy and were stung after stopping. Sixteen (14%) had systemic sting reactions; most were mild, but 4 were severe. Systemic sting reactions occurred in 12 (10.7%) of 112 patients stung in the first 4 years off venom immunotherapy and 5 (10%) of 50 stung more than 5 years off venom immunotherapy. In 4 of 8 patients with current systemic sting reactions, the skin test response was negative, although the venom-IgE response was positive at the previous encounter. All systemic sting reac tions were similar in pattern and severity to prevenom immunotherapy reactions in the same patie nt. Conclusions:We conclude that the risk of systemic sting reactions when venom immunotherapy is stopped after 5 years or longer remains in the reported range of 5% to 15% in the 5 to 10 years after stopping venom immunotherapy. This risk of systemic sting reactions does not seem to decrease over time, unlike the progressive decline in immunologic markers (skin test and venom-IgE re sponses). To prospectiv ely assess the risk of recurrent systemic sting reactions, there is a need for sting challenge stud ies of patients who have been off venom immunotherapy for 5 to 10 years and patients who have stopped venom immunotherapy after just 3 to 4 years treatment. LANDMARK PUBLICATION: Ru\u00ebff F, Wenderoth A, Przybilla B Patients still reacting to a sting challenge while receiving conventional Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy are protected by increased venom doses J Allergy Clin Immunol 2001;108:1027-32 Background: Up to 20% of patie nts allergic to Hymenoptera venom are not protected by conventional venom immunotherapy (VIT) with 100 g of any single venom. Objective:We sought to evaluate the efficacy of an increase d venom dose in patients allergic to Hymenoptera venom still reacting systemically to a sti ng challenge despite immunotherapy with 100 g of venom every 4 weeks. Methods: In this retrospective study patients were included who still had reacted systemically to a sting challenge with a living bee or wasp despit e VIT with a maintenance dose of 100 g every 4 weeks. The maintenance dose was increased to 150 or 200 g every 4 weeks, and a second sting challenge was performed. If a patient reacted agai n, the dose was further increased. Baseline mast-cell tryptase levels were assessed by using a fluoroenzyme immunoassay in stored patient sera. Results: While receiving a maintenance dose of 100 g of venom every 4 weeks for 7 to 38 months, 18 patients reacted system ically to a bee sting a nd 22 reacted to a wasp sting. After an increase of the maintenance dose to 150 g, 2 of 4 patients allergic to bee venom (BV) and 6 of 6 patients allergic to yellow jack et venom (YJV) no longer reacted systemically to the sting challenge. The respective rates of full protection were 13 of 14 and 15 of 16 in patients with an increase of the maintenance dose to 200 g from the start. Of those 4 individuals not protected by the first dose in crease, one patient allergic to BV (prior dose of 150 g) and one patient allergic to YJV (prior dose of 200 g) did not react systemically to a further sting challenge while receiving 200 g of BV or 250 g of YJV, respectively. One patie nt allergic to BV who had a system ic reaction to the sti ng challenge while receiving 150 g was not protected after a dose increase to 200 g; she later received a dose of 400 g of BV, and no further sting challenge was performed. The patient allergic to BV who still reacted systemically after a first dose increase to 200 g was a female patient with urticaria pigm entosa. She had repeated systemic adverse 264reactions to further BV imm unotherapy, necessitating discontinuation of the treatment; however, she tolerated well VIT with 200 g of YJV. In all other patients, no unusual adverse reactions to the increased venom doses were observed. Baselin e serum tryptase levels were elevated above 13.5 g/L (95th percentile in normal subjects) in 9 (28.1%) of 32 patients. Conclusions: The majority of patients allergic to Hymenoptera venom who still reacted systemically to a sting challenge despite VIT with a dose of 100 g every 4 weeks can be fully protected by an increased maintenance dose. This dose increase is well tole rated by most patients. The rather high proportion of patients with elevated baseline serum tryptas e levels necessitates further investigation of a possible association between mast ocytosis and treatment failure of conventionally dosed VIT. INVESTIGATION: Golden DBK, Kwiterovich KA, Kagey-Sobotka A, et al Discontinuing venom immunotherapy: Extended observations J Allergy Clinical Immunol 1998;101:298-302 Background: Our studies of discon tinuing venom immunotherapy after at least 5 years have led to the conclusion that the residual risk of a systemic reaction to a sting was in the range of 5% to 10% in adults, and no severe or life-threatening reaction occurred with 270 challenge stings in 74 patients after 1 to 5 years without venom immuno therapy. Objective: The objective of this study was to extend our observation of patients who discontinue venom immunotherapy over 5 to 10 years and to determine which patients are at higher risk for a reaction. Methods: Patients who discontinued venom immunotherapy were surveyed for 3 consecutive years to determine the frequency of systemic reactions to field stings and the fate of venom sensitivity. The evaluation included the 74 patients previously studied (group 1) and 51 a dditional patients followed after stopping therapy in our clinical cent er (group 2). Results: Of the orig inal 74 patients, 11 had field stings again after 3 to 7 years without ve nom immunotherapy, with one systemic reaction (dyspnea). Of the 51 patients in th e other group, 15 were stung, of whom four (26%) had systemic reactions, including respiratory symptoms requiring epinephrine. Review of group 1 and group 2 revealed that half of the patients who had syst emic reactions to a s ting after stopping venom immunotherapy had a history of a systemic r eaction occurring during venom immunotherapy (to an injection or a sting). Systemic reactions occurred in three patie nts who had negative skin test reactions; all three had very low but detectab le venom-specific serum IgE antibody levels as determined by RAST and had a history of sy stemic reactions during venom immunotherapy. Greater severity of the pretreatment reaction was not associated with higher frequency of reaction to stings after stopping therapy but was associated with greater se verity if a reaction did occur. Conclusions: Venom immunotherapy (yellow jacket/m ixed vespid) in adults can be discontinued after 5 to 6 years with a 5% to 10% residual risk of a systemic reaction. Risk factors may include history of a systemic reaction during venom immunotherapy, persistent str ongly positive skin test sensitivity, and the severity of the pretreatment reaction. INVESTIGATION: Goldberg A, Confino-Cohen R. Maintenance venom immunotherapy administered at 3-month intervals is both safe and efficacious. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2001;107:902-6 Background: Maintenance venom immunotherapy (MVIT) is usually administered to patients with venom allergy at 4- to 6-week intervals for at least 3 to 5 years. The small number of studies 265assessing the possibility of extending the maintenance interval (MI) included either too small a population and patients with only ve spid and not bee venom (BV) a llergy or relied on reaction to field stings only. Objective: We sought to assess the safety and efficacy of MVIT given at 3-month intervals to a larg e population of patients a llergic to both yellow jack et venom and BV. Methods: In all patients undergoing venom immunothera py, MI was gradually extended to 3 months. Systemic reactions (SRs) to immunotherapy injecti ons or to field stings were regularly recorded. Some of the patients were also deliberately sti ng challenged during the 3-m onth interval. Patients discontinuing MVIT were interviewed regarding thei r responses to field re-stings, and in some of them, an in-hospital sting challenge was performed. Results: One hundred sixty patients mostly allergic to BV were enrolled in the study. Failure to reach the 3-month interval was observed in 6 (3.8%) patients, originating in failure to reach th e full maintenance dose in most of them. SRs to MVIT administered at 3-month intervals were obse rved in 2.6% of the patients. One of 36 patients who experienced a field sting dur ing the 3-month interval had an objective mild SR (2.8%). Two (4.5%) of 44 patients who were deliberately stung during the 3-month interval had mild SRs. After discontinuation of MVIT, 2 (8.3%) of 24 patients who experienced a field sting had an SR. Both were allergic to yellow jacket venom. Three to 82 months after di scontinuation of MVIT, 22 patients allergic to BV were sting challenged. Only one (4.5%) patient had a mild objective SR. Conclusions: The conventional 4- to 6-week MI can easily be ex tended to 3 months in most patients without any adverse events. MVIT given at a 3-month interv al is safe and effective while being administered, as well as after its discontinuati on. This fact should be applied to almost every patient allergic to insect venom. INVESTIGATION: Goldberg A, Confino-Cohen R Effectiveness of maintenance bee venom immunotherapy administered at 6-month intervals. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 2007:99;352-7 Background: Extension of the in tervals at which maintenance venom immunotherapy (MVIT) is administered has been attempted for many year s. However, published evidence on its effect, especially in intervals of longe r than 3 months, is sparse. Obje ctive: To examine whether the administration of a bee venom (BV) maintenance dose at 6-month intervals is safe and efficacious. Methods: The 3-month intervals at which venom-alle rgic patients were recei ving their MVIT were gradually extended to 6 months. Systemic reactions (SRs) to immunotherapy in jections or to field stings were regularly recorded. Patients who were allergic to BV alone or also to other venoms were deliberately sting challenged by a honeybee after reaching the 6-month interval. Results: The 3-month intervals were extended in 47 patients. A single patient (2%) developed an SR after receiving the injection at an interv al of 4 months. Two field stings in 2 patients resulted in a mild SR in 1 patient. Of 14 sting-cha llenged patients, 3 (21%) developed an SR after the challenge. The 3 SRs occurred only among the 8 patients (38%) who were allergic to BV alone. The 3 patients with the SR to the challenge continued to re ceive the regular maintenance dose at monthly intervals 3 to 5 more times. Rep eated sting challenges were then well tolerated in all 3 patients. Conclusion: The administration of MVIT at 6-mont h intervals does not provi de suitable protection in BV-allergic patients, and they should continue MVIT at the accepted 1- to 3-month intervals. INVESTIGATION: Oude Elberink JNG, van der He ide S, Guyatt GH, Dubois AEJ 266Analysis of the burden of treatment in patients receiving an EpiPen for yellow jacket anaphylaxis J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006:118;699-704 Background: Venom immunotherapy (VIT) is a tr eatment with established efficacy for the prevention of repeated anaphylac tic reactions in patients with Hymenoptera allergy, which also allows patients to discontinue ca rrying an EpiPen. Despite their merits, both treatments can have negative aspects potentially important to patients. Objective: We examined possible negative aspects of the EpiPen in comparison with VIT as perceived by patients. Methods: Positive and negative aspects of both treatments were measured by using a burden of treatment questionnaire together with statements about the EpiPen. Results: One hundred ninety-three patients were included, of whom 94 consented to randomization: 47 received VIT, and 47 received the EpiPen. Of the remaining 99, 75 chose VIT, and 26 chose th e EpiPen. Of the patients receiving VIT, 91.5% were (extremely) positive about their treatment, and 85% would choose VIT again. Of the patients receiving the EpiPen, only 48% were positive about their treatment, and even of these patients, 68% preferred to be treated with VIT after 1 ye ar of carrying the EpiPen. Although most patients indicated that it is reassuring to carry an EpiPen and makes th em feel safe, many patients also indicated that it is inconvenie nt and troublesome. Especially pa tients who were negative about the EpiPen indicated that they would not dare use the EpiPen if necessa ry and were afraid at possible side effects. Conclusion: In cont rast to VIT, the EpiPen is pe rceived as burdensome by most patients with venom allergy. For most patients, an EpiPen is an unsuitable definitive treatment. Clinical implications: As VIT enables patients with venom allergy to get rid of the EpiPen, patients should be offered VIT. INVESTIGATION: Gonzalez de Olano D, lvarez-Twose IA, Esteban-Lopez MI, et al. Safety and effectiveness of immunotherapy in patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis presenting with described in patients with mastocytosis. Venom immunotherapy (VIT) is a safe and effective way to treat patients with Hymenoptera anaphylaxis, but few st udies have addressed its useful ness in patients with systemic mastocytosis. Objective: To study the effectivene ss and safety of VIT in patients with systemic mastocytosis having anaphylaxis after Hymenopte ra sting. Methods: A tota l of 21 mastocytosis patients\u20144 women (19%) and 17 men (81%) with a median age of 50 years (range, 29-74 years)\u2014with Hymenoptera sting anaphylaxis who were treated with VIT and followed for a median of 52 months (range, 2-250 months) were studied. Results: In 18 of 21 patients\u201416 of them lacking skin involvement\u2014anaphylaxis was the presenting symptom. Six patients (29%) experienced adverse reactions during VIT, 3 durin g initiation and 3 during maintenance. Twelve patients (57%) were restung while undergoing VIT; 9 (75%) presented local reactions and 3 (25%) systemic reactions, 1 of which required intubatio n. The Hymenoptera specific IgE decreased from 4.15 kU/L (range, 0.44-100 immu notherapy to 1.2 kU/L (P < .003). Conclusi on: immunothera py is effective to treat IgE-mediated Hymenoptera anaphylaxis in patients with ma stocytosis. Its use is recommended despite a relatively high risk of adverse reactions during the build-up phase because it provides protection from anaphylaxis in around 3/4 of the patients. 267INVESTIGATION: Mu\u00a8ller UR, G Use of b-blockers ay aggravat e anaphylactic reactions and in terfere with treatment. There is therefore concern about their use in patients who have a history of anaphyl axis or are on allergen immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is the best availabl e treatment for prevention of life-threatening anaphylaxis to Hymenoptera stings, which is often observed in elderly patients who have cardiovascular disease and therefore are on b-blocke r treatment. Objective: To analyze the risk of b-blocker treatment during venom immunotherapy. Methods: We screened all 1682 patients with Hymenoptera venom allergy seen during a period of 34 months for immunotherapy, cardiovascular disease, and treatment with b-blockers. Results : Of the 1389 patients in whom immunotherapy was recommended, 11.2% had cardiovascular disease, a nd 44 of these were on b-blockers before immunotherapy. In 31 of those, the drug was replaced before starting treatment. In 3 with coronary heart disease and 1 with severe ventricular arrhythmia, the drug was continued throughout immunotherapy. In 9, it was reintrod uced after reaching th e maintenance dose. In an additional 12 patients, b-blockers were newly started during immunotherapy. Of 25 patients on b-blockers during immunotherapy, 3 (12%) devel oped allergic side effects, compared with 23 (16.7%) of 117 with cardiovascular disease but wi thout b-blockers. Systemic alle rgic symptoms after re-exposure by sting challenge or field sting were observed in 1 of 7 (14.3%) with and 4 of 29 (13.8%) without b-blockade. No severe reactions to treatment or sting reexposure were observed in patients with b- blockade. Conclusion: Combinati on of b-blockers with venom im munotherapy may be indicated in heavily exposed patients with severe cardiovascular disease. INVESTIGATION: White KM, England RW Safety of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors while receiving venom immunotherapy Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 2008:101;426-430 Background: Case reports have raised concern ab out concurrent use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) in patients receiv ing venom immunotherapy (VIT). No surveys have been performed on the number of venom allergic patients who take ACE-Is and their outcomes. Objective: To survey the use of ACE-Is and sy stemic reaction (SR) characteristics in patients receiving VIT. Methods: A retrospective medical record review was performed on all patients evaluated for Hymenoptera venom allergy at a single center from 2000 to 2005. Patient records were evaluated for presenting symptoms, specific IgE testing, VIT treatment course, ACE-I use during VIT, and the presence of any SRs to field stings or VIT. Results: Of 288 patients evaluated from 2000 to 2005 for Hymenoptera venom allergy, 157 were found to have venom specific IgE. Of these 157 patients, 79 (50%) of those w ith Hymenoptera venom allergy underwent VIT. Seventeen of these 79 patients (21%) were taking an ACE-I during VIT. The mean overlap of a patient taking an ACE-I with the time they were receiving VIT was 30.9 months (range, 3-114 months). Patients taking ACE-Is were older (mean age, 56.2 vs 36.4 years; P < .001) and received VIT for a longer period (mean, 72.3 vs 29.9 months; P < .04). Thirteen of 62 patients not taking an ACE-I (21%) experienced an SR during their VIT. No patients taking an ACE-I experienced an SR to VIT while taking an ACE-I ( P = .03). Conclusions: This study suggests that there is not an association between ACE-I us e and increased frequency of SRs to venom immunotherapy. 268RESEARCH FRONTIER: Severino MG, caused by honeybee sting: A double- immunothera py (SLIT) proved effective and safe in respiratory allergy, and thus its use in hymenoptera al lergy can be hypothesized. Objectiv e: We sought to assess, in a proof-of-concept study, whether SLIT might potentia lly be beneficial in hymenoptera allergy. The sting challenge in large local reactions (LLRs) was used to test this hypothesis. Methods: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study involving patients with LLRs who were monosensitized to honeybee. After the baselin e sting challenge, they were randomized to either SLIT or placebo for 6 months. The treatmen t (Anallergo, Florence, It aly) involved a 6-week build-up period, followed by maintenance with 5 25 mg of venom monthl y. The sting challenge was repeated after 6 months. Results: Thirty patient s (18 male patients; mean age, 44.5 years) were enrolled, and 26 completed the study, with 1 dr opout in the active gr oup and 3 dropouts in the placebo group. In the active group the median of the peak maximal diameter of the LLRs decreased from 20.5 to 8.5 cm (P 5 .014), whereas no change was seen in the placebo group (23.0 vs 20.5 cm, P 5 not significant). The diameter was re duced more than 50% in 57% of patients. One case of generalized urticaria occu rred in a placebo-treated patien t at sting challenge. No adverse event caused by SLIT was reported. Conclusion: Honeybee SLIT signi ficantly reduced the extent of LLRs, and its safety profile was good. Alt hough LLRs are not an indication for immunotherapy, this proof-of-concept study suggests that SL IT in hymenoptera allergy deserves further investigation. Trials involving systemic r eactions and dose-ranging studies are needed. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Mu\u00a8ller UR, Jutel M, Reimers A, et al. Clinical and immunologic effects of H1 an tihistamine preventive medication during during might influence the outcome because of immunoregulatory effects. Objective: We sought to analyze the influence of 5 mg of levocetirizine (LC) on the safety, efficacy, and immunologic effects of venom immunotherapy (BVIT). Method: In a double-bli nd, placebo-controlled study 54 patients with honeybee venom allergy recei ved LC or placebo from 2 days before BVIT to day 21. Side effects during dose increase and sy stemic allergic reactio ns (SARs) to a sting challenge after 120 days were analyzed. Allergen -specific immune response was investigated in skin, serum, and allergen-stimulated T-cell cultur es. Results: Side effects were significantly more frequent in patients receiving placebo. Four patien ts receiving placebo dropped out because of side effects. SARs to the sting challenge occurred in 8 patients (6 in the LC group and 2 in the placebo group). Seven SARs were only cutaneous, and 1 in the placebo group was also respiratory. Difference of SARs caused by the sting challenge as insignificant. Specific IgG levels increased significantly in both groups. Majo r allergen phospholipas e A2-stimulated T cells from both groups showed a slightly decreased prol iferation. The decrease in IFN-g and IL-13 levels with placebo was not prominent with LC, whereas IL-10 levels showed a significant increase in the LC group only. Decreased histamine receptor (HR)1/HR2 ratio in allergen-specific T cells on day 21 in the 269placebo group was prevented by LC. Conclusions: LC reduces side effects during dose increase without influencing the efficacy of BVIT. LC modulates the natura l course of allergen-specific immune response and affects the expression of HRs and cytokine production by allergenspecific T cells. 9. Economic costs of diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases REVIEW ECONOMICS OF RHINITIS: Nathan, Robert A The Burden of Allergic Rhinitis. Allergy and Asthma Proceedings, Volume 28, Number 1, January-February 2007, pp. 3-7 Although formerly regarded as a nuisance disease, al lergic rhinitis (AR) ha s a considerable effect on quality of life and can have significant consequences if left untr eated. The total burden of this disease lies not only in impaire d physical and social functioning but also in a financial burden made greater when considering evidence that AR is a possible causal factor in comorbid diseases such as asthma or sinusitis. Compared with matched controls, patients with AR have an approximate twofold increase in medication costs and 1.8-fold the number of visits to health practitioners. Hidden direct costs include the treatment of comorbid asthma, chronic sinusitis, otitis media, upper respiratory infection, and nasal po lyposis. Nasal congestion, the most prominent symptom in AR, is associated with sleep-disor dered breathing, a condition that can have a profound effect on mental health, including increase d psychiatric disorders, depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse. Furthermore, sleep-diso rdered breathing in childhood and adolescence is associated with increased disorders of learning performance, behavior, and attention. In the United States, AR results in 3.5 million lost workdays and 2 million lost schooldays annually. Patients struggle to alleviate their miser y, frequently self-adjusting their treatment regimen of over-the- counter and prescription medications because of lack of efficacy, deterioration of efficacy, lack of 24-hour relief, and bothersome side effects. Ironi cally, health care providers overestimate patient satisfaction with therapy. Therefore, improve ment in patient-practit ioner communication may enhance patient adherence w ith prescribed regimens. REVIEW PHARMACOECONOMICS OF ASTHMA: JW Cheng, RJ Arnold Pharmacoeconomic review of medical management of persistent asthma. Allergy Asthma Proc.2008 Mar-Apr,29(2):109-22 Asthma affects 20 million Americans and causes a substantial loss of productivity. Medications help to increase symptom-free days and improve quality of life. Examining the cost-effectiveness of different treatments, in addition to their cl inical efficacy, allows us to choose the optimal strategy in managing patients. This study re views published pharmacoeconomic analyses of different medications used for asthma management , with a focus on medications available in the United States. English language, peer-reviewed ar ticles, or abstracts were identified from MEDLINE and Current Contents databases (bot h 1966 to March 1, 2006) using the search terms asthma, pharmacoeconomics, cost-effectivenes s, steroids, beta(2)-agonists, cromolyn, methylxanthines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and omalizumab. Citations from available articles were reviewed also for additional refe rences. Pharmacoeconomic analysis from a payer's perspective has shown that salmeterol/fluticasone is a cost-effective treatment option for moderate persistent asthma management, when compared w ith fluticasone with or without the addition of leukotriene modifiers. Leukotriene m odifiers are less cost-effective th or 270combined inhaled steroids and long-acting beta(2)-a gonists for m ild or moderate persistent asthma. Anti-IgE antibody has been shown inconsistently, to be cost-effective in patients with moderate to severe allergic asthma. Although the acquisition cost of levalbuterol is higher, one study showed that it may be more cost-effective than albuterol after taking into account reduction in hospitalizations. Cost-effectiveness analyses and clinical efficacy of medications, together with other patient-specific factors, are important inform ation to be considered when selecting treatment regimens for asthma. Future economic analysis should focus on finding bett er ways to evaluate productivity lost due to asthma, in addition to hospitalization. 10. Psychosocial aspects of allergic diseases and chronic illness, failure of adherence to therapy REVIEW PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS OF CHRONIC ILLNESS: Julie Schmittdiel, David M. Mosen, Russell E. Glasgow, Judith Hibbard, Carol Remmers and Jim Bellows. Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PAC IC) and Improved Patient-centered Outcomes for Chronic Conditions. Journal of General Internal Medicine. Vol.23 (1):77-80. November 21, 2007 (online) BACKGROUND: The Patient Assessment of Chronic Illn ess Care (PACIC) has potential for use as a patient-centered measure of the implementation of the Chronic Care Model (CCM), but there is little research on the relationship between the PACIC and important behavioral and quality measures for patients with chronic conditions. OB JECTIVE: To examine the relationship between PACIC scores and self-management behaviors, patient rating of thei r health care, and self-reported quality of life. DESIGN: Cross-sectional surv ey with a 61% response rate. PARTICIPANTS: Included in the survey were 4,108 adults with di abetes, chronic pain, heart failure, asthma, or coronary artery disease in the Kaiser Perm anente Medical Care program across 7 regions nationally. MEASUREMENTS: The PACIC was th e main independent variable. Dependent variables included use of self-management resour ces, self-management beha viors such as regular exercise, self-reported adherence to medications, patient rating of th eir health care, and quality of life. RESULTS: PACIC scores we re significantly, positively associated with all measures (odds ratio [ORs] ranging from 1.20 to 2.36) with the ex ception of self-reported medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the PACIC, a practic al, patient-level a ssessment of CCM implementation, could be an important tool for h ealth systems and other stakeholders looking to improve the quality of chronic disease care. B. Immunodeficiency Diseases REVIEW PRACTICE GUIDELINE Primary Immunodeficiency: Bonilla F, Bernstein IL,Khan DA, et al. Practice parameter for the diagnosis and management of primary immunodeficiency. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol, 2005;94:S1-63. A principal aim of this Practice Parameter is to organize current knowledge and practice in thediagnosis and management of primary immunodefi ciency diseases. Preparation of this Practice Parameter included a review of the medical litera ture, mainly via the PubMed database. Published clinical studies or reports were rated by category of evidence and used to establish the strength of a clinical recommendation. There are few randomized trials in the diagnosis and management of primary immunodeficiency. Thus, most of thes e recommendations represent evidence from published case series or reports or the opinions of experts in the field. 271 REVIEW: Fischer A. Human primary immunodeficiency diseases: a perspective. Nat Immun ol 2004;5:23-30. Primary immunodeficiency diseases consist of a group of more than 100 inherited conditions, mostly monogenic, predisposing in dividuals to different sets of infections, allergy, autoimmunity and cancer. Primary immunodeficiencies theref ore represent exquisite models of various immunopathological settings. The iden tification of the associated ge nes, 100 so far, has generated a plethora of information about the immune system and spurred the analysis of many aspects of the development, function and regulation of both i nnate and adaptive immunity. These findings can potentially contribute to improve d care of affected individuals by providing new diagnostic and/or therapeutic tools. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Fischer A. Hacein-Bey-Abina S.

Combined immunodeficiencies syndromes of lymphocytes. Clinical Immunol 2003;109:109-18, 2003. The recent identification of the genes involved in many primary immunodeficiency disorders has led to a significant increase in our understandin g of the pathogenesis of these defects. Many of these disorders share a clinical phenotype with common features such as recurrent infections, chronic inflammation, and autoimmunity. Although some of these immune defects have mild presentations and better outcomes, others result in severe infecti ons and significant morbidity and mortality. For these, early diagnosis and treatmen t are critical. This revi ew provides an overview of the genetic defects an d clinical features of primary immu ne deficiencies due to defects in lymphocytes. REVIEW: Schroeder HW Jr. Schroeder HW 3rd. Sheikh SM. The complex genetics of commo n variable immunodeficiency. Journal Invest Med 2004;.52:90-103. Immunoglobulin (Ig)A deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) are the most common primary immunodeficiency di sorders in North America and Europe. These diseases appear to comprise a familial spectrum of immunodeficiency that ranges from partial IgA deficiency to a complete absence of serum immunoglobulin. The CVID phenotype is typically 272acquired and can spontaneously revert to IgG and IgM sufficiency. Family studies suggest thevpresenc e of at least two susceptibility loci within the major histocompatibility complex on the short arm of chromosome 6: one located near th e class II region and the other located near the junction between the class III and class I regions . Inheritance of these susceptibility genes may yield an additive risk for the development of immunodeficiency. First-degree family members of patients with CVID are at risk throughout their lives for the development of these diseases and should be monitored with a high index of suspicion. a. Predominant antibody deficiencies REVIEW: Ballow M. Primary immunodeficiency diso rders: antibody deficiency. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2002;109:581-91. As a group, antibody deficiencies represent th e most common types of primary immune deficiencies in human subjects. Often symptoms do not appear until the latter part of the first year of life, as passively acquired IgG from the mother decreases to below protective levels. As with the T-cell immune deficiencies, the spectrum of an tibody deficiencies is br oad, ranging from the most severe type of antibody deficiency with totally absent B cells and serum Igs to patients who have a selective antibody deficiency with normal serum I g. In addition to the increased susceptibility to infections, a number of other disease processes (eg, autoimmun ity and malignancies) can be involved in the clinical presenta tion. Fortunately, the availability of intravenous immune serum globulin has made the management of these patients more complete. Recently, molecular immunology has led to iden tification of the gene or genes involved in many of these antibody deficiencies. As discussed in this review, this has led to a better elucidation of the B-cell development and differentiation pathways and a more complete understanding of the pathogenesis of many of these antibody deficiencies. b. Other well defined immunodeficiency syndromes REVIEW Geha Bonilla FA. The presentation and natural history of immuno deficiency caused by nuclear factor kappaB essential modulator mutation. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2004;113;725-723 An increasing number of rare genetic defects are associated with immunodeficiency and impaired ability to activate gene transcription through nuclear factor (NF) kappaB. Hypomorphic mutations in the NFkappaB essential modulator (NEMO) im pair NFkappaB function and are linked to both immunodeficiency and ectodermal dysplasia (E D), as well as susceptibility to atypical mycobacterial infections. OBJECT IVE: We sought to investigat e the clinical and immunologic natural history of patients with NEMO mu tation with immunodeficiency (NEMO-ID). METHODS: Patients with severe bacterial in fection and ED or une xplained mycobacterial sensitivity were evaluated for NEMO mutation. Labor atory investigations a nd clinical data were retrospectively and prospectiv ely accumulated and reviewed. RESULTS: We have given a diagnosis of NEMO-ID to7 boys; 6 had ED, and 5 had gene mutations in the 10th exon of NEMO. Our resulting estimated incide nce of NEMO-ID is 1:250,000 live ma le births. All patients had serious pyogenic bacterial illnesses early in life, and the median age of first infection was 8.1 months. Most boys had mycobacterial disease (median age, 84 months), and a minority had 273herpesviral infections. Initial immunologic assessme nts showed hypogammaglobulinemia (median IgG, 170 mg/dL) with variable IgM (median, 41 mg/dL) and IgA (median, 143 mg/dL) levels. Two patients had increased IgM levels, and 5 had increased IgA levels. All patients evaluated had normal lymphocyte subsets with impaired prol iferative responses, sp ecific antibody production, and natural killer cell function. Two patients died from complica tions of mycobacterial disease (ages 21 and 33 months). CONCLUSION: NEMO-ID is a combined immunode ficiency with early susceptibility to pyogenic bacteria and later susceptibility to my cobacterial infection. Specific features of particular NEMO mutations in these patie nts provide insight into the role of this gene in immune function. REVIEW Wiskott Aldrich: Rengan R. Ochs HD. Molecular biology skott-Aldrich syndrome. Rev Immunogen.2000; 2:243-55 The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome an X-li nked primary immunodeficiency associated with thrombocytopenia, bloody diarrhea, eczema, recurrent infections, and a high incidence of malignancies. X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) is a milder form with predominant platelet abnormalities. Both are caused by mutations of the cytoplasmic WAS protein (WASP). To date, mutations of WASP have been identified in over 340 families and consist of missense and nonsense mutations, deletions and insertions, an d splice site mutations. There is a striking correlation between phenotype and genotype. The complex gene product of WASP has multiple functional domains that contribute to actin po lymerization, cell motility, intracellular signaling, and apoptosis. Understanding the molecular ba sis of WAS/XLT not onl y explains the highly variable clinical phenotype, but also affects the medical manage ment of this serious congenital disorder. CUTTING EDGE ARTICLE: Friedrich W, , H\u00f6nig M . Results and long-term outcome in 39 patients w ith Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome transplanted from HLA-matched and -mismatched donors. Immunol Res. 2008 Oct 10. [Epub ahead of print] In this report, we present an analysis in 39 WAS patients treated by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in our center since 1983. Fifteen patients received transplants from HLA- identical unrelated donors, 15 from nonidentical parental donors, and 9 from matched siblings. The overall survival rate is 90% in patients with matched donors and 50% in pa tients after nonidentical transplantation, with a mean follo w-up time of 11 years. Treatment failures in the latter group were mainly related to graft rejections and to GvHD and infections following repeat transplants. Long- term survivors in both patient groups remain with few exceptions free of late complications and with stable graft function and complete donor cell chimerism. Based on our findings, we recommend early and prompt tr eatment of each diagnosed WAS patient if an HLA-matched, related or unrelated, donor can be identified. If this is not the case, HLA-nonidentical donor transplantation represents an alternative to be co nsidered early in patients with severe disease. (XLP) is a rare, often fatal, primary imm unodeficiency that has profound and damaging effects on the immune system of affected individuals. It is characterized by a dysregulated i mmune response, most commonly to Epstein-Barr viral infection. The defective gene in this syndrome has been identified as SAP-SLAM (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule)-associated protein. It is an adapter molecule that is required for appropriate function of the SLAM-related recep tors. There is now a greater understanding of the molecular associations and cellular pathoge nesis of SAP and this review will summarize the most recent findings. Clinically, XLP may be di fficult to diagnose as a result of its varied clinical phenotype, and protein and genetic assays are currently used to make a definitive diagnosis. With the advances in gene analysis and genomics technology, it is likely that better and more rapid diagnostic techniques will become available. REVIEW TYPE I INTERFERON DEFICIENCIES: Jouanguy E Casanova Biochimie. 2007 Jun-Jul;89( 6-7):878-83. Epub 2007 May 8. Type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta and related mo lecules) ar e essential for protective immunity to experimental infection by numerous viruses in the mouse model. In recent years, human primary immunodeficiencies affecting eith er the production of (UNC-93B deficiency) or the response to (STAT1 and TYK2 deficiencies) these IFNs have been reported. Affect ed patients are highly susceptible to certain viruses. Patients with STAT 1 or TYK2 deficiency are susceptible to multiple viruses, including herpes simplex encephalitis. However, these imm unological defects are not limited to type I IFN- mediated immunity. Impaired type II IFN (IFN- gamma)-mediated immunity plays no more than a minor role in the pathogenesis of viral diseases in these patients, but the contribution of impaired type III IFN (IFN-lambda)-mediated immunity re mains to be determined. These novel inherited disorders strongly suggest that type I IFN-mediated immunity is essential for protection against natural infections caused by several viruses in humans.

Mutations in recombination activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG1 and RAG2) cause a spectrum of severe immunodeficiencies syndrome (OS) to an increasing number of peculiar cases. While it is well established from biochemical da ta that the specific genetic defect in either of the RAG genes is the first de terminant of the clinical presentation, there is also increasing evidence that environmental factors play an impor tant role and can lead to a different phenotypic expression of a given genotype. However, a bett er understanding of the m echanisms by which the molecular defect impinges on the cellular phenotype of OS is still lacking.

Primary immune deficiency disorders presen ting as autoimmune diseases: IPE X 1:S11-9. Epub 2008 Feb 9. BACKGROUND: Several primary immune deficiency disorders are associated with autoimmunity and malignancy, suggesting a state of immune dysregulation. The concept of immune dysregulation as a direct cause of autoimmunity in primary immune deficiency disorders (PIDDs) has been strengthened by the recent discovery of di stinct clinical entities linked to single-gene defects resulting in multiple autoimmune phenomena including immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy and X-linke dystrophy (APECED) syndrome. CONCLUSION: reviewing recent advances in ou r understanding of the small subgroup of PIDD patients with defined causes for autoimmunity ma y lead to the development of more effective treatment strategies for idiopath ic human autoimmune diseases. REVIEW MHC CLASS II DEFICIENCIES: Chen X , Jensen PE . MHC class II antigen presentation and immunol ogical abnormalities due to deficiency of MHC class II and its associated genes. Exp Mol Pathol. 2008 Aug;85(1):40-4. Epub 2008 Apr 13. Antigen pre sentation by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules plays an important role in controlling immunity and autoimmunity. Multiple co-factors including the invariant chain (Ii), HLA-DM and HLA-DO are involved in this process. While the role for Ii and DM has been well defined, the biol ogical function of DO remains obscure. Our data indicate that DO inhibits presentation of endogenous self-antigens and that developmentally-regulated DO expression enables antigen presenting cells to pref erentially present different sources of peptide antigens at different stages of development. Disruption of this regulatory mechanism can result in not only immunodeficiency but also autoimmunity. De spite the fact that de letion of each of the three genes in experimental animals is asso ciated with profound imm unological abnormalities, no corresponding human diseases have been reported. This discrepancy suggests the possibility that primary immunodeficiencies due to a genetic defect of Ii, DM and DO in humans are under diagnosed or diagnosed as \"common variable immunodeficiency\", a category of immunodeficiency of heterogeneous or undefined etiology. Clinical tests for any of these potential genetic defects are not yet available. We propos e the use of multi-color flow cytometry in conjunction with intracellular staining to detect expression of Ii, DM, DO in peripheral blood B cells as a convenient reliable screening test to identify individuals w ith defects in antigen presentation. c. Complement deficiencies including hereditary acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency REVIEW: Wen L. Atkinson JP. Giclas PC. Clinical and laboratory evaluation of complement deficiency. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2004;113:585-93. The complement system provides innate defense against microbial pathogens and is a \"complement\" to humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity. Consisting of plasma and membrane 276proteins, this proinflamma tory system works in part by a cascade involv ing limited proteolysis whereby one component activates the next, resulti ng in a dramatic amplification. The overall goal is deposition of complement fragments on pat hologic targets for the purposes of opsonization, lysis, and liberation of peptides that promot e the inflammatory response. Deficiencies of complement components predispose to infections and autoimmune syndromes. Even though total deficiency of a complement compon ent is rare, patients presenting with certain bacterial infections and autoimmune syndromes, especially SLE, have a much greater inciden ce of deficiency. This review will summarize the clinical manifestations and pathophys iology of congenital and acquired complement deficiency diseases. We will also pr esent an algorithm for laboratory diagnosis of complement deficiency and discuss current and future therapeutic options. REVIEW: Kaplan AP. C1 inhibitor deficiency: hereditary 2001;11:211-9. C1 inhibitor deficiency can be he reditary or acquired. The hereditary disorder has two types, each of which is inherited as a dominant disorder, with genetic mechanisms leading either to low levels of normal C1 INH and little or no mutant problem as a result of mRNA or protein synthetic defects or degradative mechanisms (Type I) or with point mutations and synthesis of a functionless protein product with transinhibition of the normal allele (T ype II). The acquired disorder with low C1q is due to C1 INH consumption asso ciated with lymphoma or conn ective tissue disease (Type I) and/or autoimmune mechanisms (Type II). The swelling of all types is due to absence of inhibition of the plasma kinin forming casca de with liberation of bradykini n while complement activation, a critical marker of the disorder, is not responsible for the swelling. Treatment employs androgenic compounds, antifibrinolytic agents, or replacement therapy. REVIEW: Gompels MM. Lock RJ. Abinun M. et : consensus document Clin Exp Immunol 2005. 139:379-94 We present a consensus document on the diagnosis and management of C1 inhibitor deficiency, a syndrome characterized clinically by recurren t episodes of angio-oedema. In hereditary angiooedema, a rare autosomal dominant conditi on, C1 inhibitor function is reduced due to impaired transcription or produc tion of non-functional protein. Th e diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of a low serum C4 and absent or grea tly reduced C1 inhibitor level or function. The condition can cause fatal laryngeal oedema and feat ures indistinguishable from gastrointestinal tract obstruction. Attacks can be precipitated by tr auma, infection and other stimulants. Treatment is graded according to response and the clinical si te of swelling. Acute treatment for severe attack is by infusion of C1 inhibitor concentrate and for minor and/or tranexamic acid. There are a number of new products in trial, including genetically engineered C1 esterase inhibitor, kallikrein inhibitor and bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. Individual sections provide special advice with respect to diagnosis, management (pr ophylaxis and emergency car e), special situations (childhood, pregnancy, contraception, travel a nd dental care) and service specification. 277REVIEW: Zur aw BL Clinical practice.

Congenital defects of phagocyt ic number, (PIDs) primarily affecting the and macrophages) typically predispose patients to inf ections. However, one of the most clinically important features of these diso rders is their relatively narr ow spectrum of disease-specific infections. Invasive aspergillosis in the absence of immune suppression is essentially seen only in chronic granulomatous disease; disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in the absence of immune suppression is seen predomin antly in patients with defects of the IFN- gamma/IL-12 axis. In contrast, infections that are relatively common in some of the PIDs affecting the lymphoid system (Pneumocystis jiroveci and Streptococcus are extremely uncommon in PIDs affecting phagocytes. Theref ore careful attention to the microbiology laboratory early in the course of evaluation of a patient with recurr ent infections and suspected of having a PID will help steer the workup in the appropriate direction. Over the last few years, there have been major advances in the molecular and cellular understandings of PIDs affecting phagocytes. As the field of PIDs becomes broader and more clinical and molecular definition becomes available, it is increasingly important to be able to identi fy likely pathways for investigation early in th e evaluation. Here we have updated some of the more rapidly evolving aspects of PIDs affecting phagocytes, with a special emphasis on the associated microbiology.

Gene transfer into hematopoietic stem ce lls has been successfully used to correct immunodeficiencies affecting the lymphoid compartm ent. However, similar results have not been reported for diseases affecting myeloid cells, ma inly due to low engraf tment levels of gene- modified cells observed in unconditioned patients. Here we review the developments leading to a gene therapy approach for the treatment of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), a primary life threatening immunodeficiency caused by a defect in the oxidative antimic robial activity of phagocytes. Although the dis ease can be cured by bone marrow transplantation, this treatment is only available to patients with HLA-identical sibl ing or matched unrelated donors. One therapeutic option for patients without suitab le donor is the genetic modificat ion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Although early attemp ts to correct CGD by gene therapy were unsuccessful, these studies demonstrated the safety and limitations of gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) of CGD patients using retr oviral vectors. The recent development of advanced gene transduction protocols together with improved re troviral vectors, combined with low intensity chemotherapy conditioning, allowed partial corre ction of the granulocytic function with a significant clinical benefit in treated patients. Th ese results may have impor tant implications for future applications of gene therapy in myeloid disorders and inherited diseases using hematopoietic stem cells. REVIEW Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiencies: Etzioni A. Leukocyte adhesion deficiencies: Med Biol. 2007; 601:51-60. Leukocyte trafficking from bloodstr eam to tissue is important for the continuous surveillance for foreign antigens, as well as for rapid leukocyte a ccumulation at sites of inflammatory response or tissue injury. Leukocyte in teraction with vascular endothelial cells is a pivotal event in the inflammatory response and is mediated by several families of adhesion molecules. The crucial role of the beta2-integrin subfamily in leukocyte emigration was established after leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) I was discovere d. Patients with this disorder suffer from life-threatening bacterial infections, and in its severe form, death usually occurs in early childhood unless bone marrow transplantation is performed. The LAD II disorder clarifies the role of the selectin receptors and their fucosylated ligands. Clinicall y, patients with LAD II suffer from a less severe form of disease, resembling the moderate phenotype of LAD I. LAD III emphasizes the importance of the integrin activation phase in th e adhesion cascade. Although the primary defect is still unknown, it is clear that all he matopoietic integrin activation processes are defective, which lead to severe infection as observed in LAD I and to marked increase tendency for bleeding problems.

All integrins are normally expressed yet a defect in their activation leads to the observed clinical manifestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Less than 20 patients have been reported world wide and the primary genetic defect was identified in some of them. Here we describe the clinical features of patients in whom a mutation in th e calcium and diacylglycerol-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (CalDAG GEF1) wa s found and compare them to other cases of LAD III and to animal models harboring a mu tation in the CalDAG GEF1 gene. DISCUSSION: The hallmarks of the syndrome are recurrent infe ctions accompanied by severe bleeding episodes distinguished by osteopetrosis like bone abnormalities and neurodevelopmental defects.

Curr Opin Allergy Clin Imm unol. 2008 Dec; 8(6):527-533. PURPOSE OF review Hyper IgE syndrome (HIES) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by eczema, recurrent skin and lung infections, elevated serum IgE, and connective tissue and skeletal abnormalities. We present newly recognized aspects of the clinical phenotype and discuss recent genetic and immunologic findings. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2007, mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were determ ined to be the cause of autosomal- dominant HIES. Mutations lead to disruption of STAT3-dependent pathways, which are crucial for signaling of many cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-10. On the one hand, cells from STAT3- defective patients have a proinflammatory profile with elevated TNFalpha and IFNgamma; on the other hand, STAT3 mutations result in the inab ility to produce IL-17 or form Th17 cells. SUMMARY: HIES was previously defined on the basi s of clinical manifestations and laboratory markers that were not specific to the disease. With the identification of STAT3 mutations as the cause of HIES, we can definitively characterize th e disease at molecular and immunologic levels. Future study of HIES and STAT3 will help us understand eczema, IgE regulation, infection susceptibility, coronary artery dis ease, scoliosis, and bronchiectasis as well as provide mechanistic insights into treatment.

Epub 2008 Mar 12. The autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (HIE S, 'Job's syndrome') is characterized by recurrent and often severe pulmonary celes, eczema, staphylococcal and connective tissue. Mutations presumed to underlie HIES have recently been identified in stat3, the gene encoding STAT3 280(signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) (refs 3, 4) . Although impaired production of interferon-gamma and tumour-necrosis factor by T cells, dimi nished memory T-cell populations, decreased delayed-type-hypersensitivity responses and decreased in vitro lymphoproliferation in response to specific antigens have variably been described, specific immunological abnormalities that can explain the unique suscepti bility to particular infections seen in HIES have not yet been defined. Here we show that interleukin (IL)-17 produc tion by T cells is absent in HIES individuals. We observed that ex vivo T cells from subjects with HIES failed to produce IL-17, but not IL-2, tumour-necrosis factor or interferon-gamma, on stim ulation with Candida albicans or streptokinase. Purified naive T cells were unable to differentiate into IL-17-producing (T(H)17) T helper cells in vitro and had lower expression of retinoid-rela ted orphan receptor (ROR)-gammat, which is consistent with a crucial role for STAT3 signalling in the generatio n of T(H)17 cells. T(H)17 cells have emerged as an important subset of helper T ce lls that are believed to be cri tical in the clearance of fungal and extracellular bacterial infections. Thus, our data suggest that the inability to produce T(H)17 cells is a mechanism underlying the susceptibility to th e recurrent infections commonly seen in HIES. e. Clinical skills for diagnosis and treatment REVIEW PRACTICE GUIDELINE Primary Immunodeficiency: Bonilla F, Bernstein IL, Khan DA, et al. Practice parameter for the diagnosis and management of primary immunodeficiency. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol, 2005;94:S1-63. A principal aim of this Practice Parameter is to organize current knowledge and practice in the diagnosis and management of pr imary immunodeficiency diseases. Preparation of this Practice Parameter included a review of the medical litera ture, mainly via the PubMed database. Published clinical studies or reports were rated by category of evidence and used to establish the strength of a clinical recommendation. There are few randomized trials in the diagnosis and management of primary immunodeficiency. Thus, most of thes e recommendations represent evidence from published case series or reports or the opinions of experts in the field. REVIEW: Weiler CR. Bankers-Fulbright JL. Common variable immunodeficiency: test Mayo Clin Proc.2005; 80:1187-2000 Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder that can present with multiple phenotypes, all of whic h are characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, in a person at any age. A specific ge netic defect that accounts for a ll CVID phenotypes has not been identified, and it is likely that several distinct ge netic disorders with similar clinical presentations are responsible for the observed variation. In this review, we summarize the known genetic mutations that give rise to hypogammaglobulinemia and how these gene products affect normal or abnormal B-cell development and function, with particular emphasis on CVID. Additionally, we describe specific phenotypic and genetic laboratory tests that can be used to diagnose CVID and provide guidelines for test interpretati on and subsequent therapeutic intervention. REVIEW: Paul ME. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency: clin ical clues and diagnostic tests. 281Curr Allergy Asthma Rep 2002. 2:349-55. Recognition of imm unodeficiency allows steps to be taken to minimize morbidity and mortality. Immunodeficiency can be secondary to viral in fection, most importantly secondary to HIV-1 worldwide, medications, disruption of the usual infection clearance mechanisms, or secondary to a myriad of systemic disorders. Immunodeficiency may also be due to one of the growing list of primary immunodeficiency disorders. In infa ncy, lymphopenia should trigger an evaluation investigating the possibility of severe combined immunodeficiency. Evaluations of children should be done keeping in mind that normal numbers of ly mphocytes are higher in children than in adults, immunoglobulin levels in children are lower th an in adults in younger age groups, and antibody production in response to polysaccharide antigens is not usually fully developed in the less-than 2- year-old child. REVIEW: Tangsinmankong N. Bahna SL. Good RA. The immunologic workup of the child suspected of immunodeficiency. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 2001; 87: 362-9. This review is intended to provide an outline for the evaluation of patients suspected of having immunodeficiency, a problem that is frequen tly encountered in clinical practice. DATA SOURCES: Information was obtained through a MEDLINE literature search as well as from standard textbooks in imm unology. Also included is information that reflects the authors' clinical experience in the field. RESULTS: In general clinic al practice, many physicians feel inadequate to evaluate patients with suspected immune defici encies. They also thi nk that the process of evaluation is time consuming, which results in misd iagnosis of a substantia l percentage of such disorders. Hence, the prevalence of immunodeficien cy disorders is much higher than generally thought. At present, there are >80 unique primary immunodeficiency conditions and >50 syndromes that are associated with various im munologic defects. The prevalence of secondary immunodeficiency has also been in creasing because of the tragic epidemic of HIV infection, more usage of immunosuppressive medications and bone marrow stem cell transplantation, and the severe degree of malnutrition in underdeveloped countries. It is necessary for clinicians, particularly the specialists in a llergy and immunology, to be able to evaluate the status of the immune system. CONCLUSIONS: Very valuable information can be gathered from the medical history and physical examination that may excl ude or increase the suspicion of immunologic defect. Laboratory tests can then be appropriately selected to defi ne the specific defect. Once the diagnosis has been settled, proper medical mana gement can be institu ted with subsequent improvement in morbidity and mortality of such disorders. REVIEW: Durandy A. Wahn V. Petteway S. Gelfand EW. Immunoglobulin replacement ther apy in primary success. mprise the largest group of primary immunodeficiency diseases. Since th e first description of patients with low gammaglobulin levels more than four decades ago, a gr eat wealth of information has b een accumulated. Especially in the last several years, the application of molecular and genetic techniques has unraveled many of these disorders, identifying disorders of B cell developm ent, failure of class switch recombination and 282abnormalities of specific antibody p roduction. Regardless of the underlying defect, the mainstay of therapy has been and remains immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy, cu rrently by intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection. With advances in manufacturing, a number of products are not only safe for intravenous administration but doses can be increased to provide even more effective infection prophylaxis. However, manufacturing pr ocesses, methods of viral inactivation and removal and final composition differ widely am ong the available preparations. How these variables impact clinical outcome is not clear, but they have the potential to do so. As a result, careful selection of an intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), ma tching patient needs and risks to those risks associated with a sp ecific IVIG, is necessary to opt imize outcomes and maximize the success of Ig replacement therapy.

DATA SOURCES: Articles describing th e use of flow cytometry in the diagnosis of several primar y immunodeficiency diseases we re obtained through the National Library of Medicine database . STUDY SELECTION: Publications that described novel and known applications of flow cytometry in primary immunodeficiency disease were selected. Review articles were included. Articles describing the different immunodeficiency diseases and methods of diagnosis were also selected. DAT A EXTRACTION: Approximately 100 data sources were analyzed, and those with the most releva nt information were selected. DATA SYNTHESIS: The diagnosis of many primary im munodeficiency diseases requires the use of several laboratory tests. Flow cytometry has become an important part of the workup of indivi duals suspected to have such a disorder. Knowledge of the pathogenesis of many of these diseases continues to increase, hence we acquire a better understa nding of the laboratory tests that may be helpful in diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry is applicable in the initial wor kup and subsequent management of several primary immunodeficiency diseases. As our understanding of the pathogenesis and management of these diseases increases, the use of many of these assays may become routine in hospitals. 283REVIEW STEM Marrow Aug;42 Suppl 1:S49-S52. The first hematopoietic cell tran splants in humans with durable success were re ported in 1968, in three patients with primary im munodeficiencies who received graf ts from HLA-matched siblings (two with SCID and one with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome). Significant progress has been made in correcting lethal primary immunode ficiencies (PIDs) with hemat opoietic transplantation in the ensuing 40 years due to several factors: (1 ) ability to phenotype and quantitate (CD34+) hematopoietic stem cells, (2) advent of high-reso lution tissue typing, (3) availability of closely matched unrelated donor bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, and cord blood, and (4) the application of reduced intensity conditioning regi mens pre-transplant. Furthermore, the genetic basis of the majority of lethal PIDs has been defined, allowing more accurate studies of the natural history of the disorders without HCT intervention, and providing a compelling rationale for early transplantation in disorders with median survivals of 15-20 years. In the current era, we can identify several factors, which influence the u ltimate success of HCT for PID. These include the age at transplant and general health of the patient. Young age is associated with fewer comorbidities and less frequent pre-transplant exposure to herpes family and enteric viruses, thus lowering the risks of related post- transplant complications. The caref ul selection of pre-transplant conditioning can signific antly reduce early TRM in patients with certain immunodeficiencies, and increase the probability of durable engraftment in others. Because of the specific needs of children with PIDs, HCT from unrelated donors should, ideally, be performe d in centers with extensive expertise and experience in the treatment of such disorders. In such centers, donor selection based on high-resolution tissue t yping, younger age and specific viral imm unity has led to survival rates following matched unrelated donor HCT for PIDs, whic h are very similar to those obtained with HCT from matched sibling donors. While ultimate success rates ar e similar, tran splant-related management of children receivi ng unrelated grafts is consid erably more complicated and prolonged than following matched sibling HCT. 2. Acquired immunodeficiency diseases a. Due to infection, AIDS and other REVIEW: Sleasman JB, Goodenow MM HIV-1 infection J Allergy Clin Immunol 2003;111:S582-92. This review is intended to provide a fundamental perspective on the dyna mic interplay between HIV-1 and the immune system, an essential aspect in defining the pathogenesis and treatment of AIDS . HIV-1 infection, the cause of AIDS , is a worldwide pandemic with enormous adverse health and economic implications, particularly in the developing worl d. This bloodborne and sexually transmitted disease, which evolved from simian immunodeficiency virus, infects and replicates in helper T cells macrophages a nd utilizes CD4 and a chemokine coreceptor for entry. Immune deficiency occurs as a result of vi rally induced attrition of CD4 T cells, resulting in the development of opportunistic infections and malignancy. Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections is required according to the extent of immune defici ency. HIV-specific immunity can control viral replication and dela y disease progression but does not clear infection. Antiretroviral 284treatment consists of inhibitors that target for vi ral entry, reverse transcriptase, and viral protease. Therapy can control vira l replication, restore immunity, and delay disease progression, but it cannot eliminate infection. Thus ch ronic infection persists even in treated patients. Antiretroviral drugs have been highly effective in preventing mother-to-child transmission and for postexposure prophylaxis. Several novel vaccines in development hold promise fo r either effective infection prevention or attenuation of disease progression. (EBV) is a ubiquitous member of the herpesvirus family that is associated with a variety of lymphomas and lym phoproliferative diseases. It enc odes a multitude of genes that drive proliferation or confer resistance to cell death. Among these are two key viral proteins which mimic the effects of the activated cellular signa ling proteins. EBV-associated lymphomas include in immunocompromized populations, and H odgkin's lymphoma. The character of the viral association differs among these entities with so me consistently associated with EBV in all populations and all parts of the wo rld, and others associated with the virus only in particular circumstances. An example of the former is nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, while an example of the latter is Burkitt's lymphoma. The pattern of vira l gene expression also varies among tumor types with different viral genes playing key roles in different tumors and conferring sensitivity to immune surveillance. Thus some of the post- transplant lymphoprolif erative diseases are exquisitely sensitive to CD8 T-cell immunosurveil lance, while other tumors such as Burkitt's lymphoma may be nearly impervious to such su rveillance. Knowledge of the EBV association is not only important for understanding the pathogen esis of these tumors, but is increasingly important for diagnosis, monitoring and treatment. REVIEW: Rouse BT, Sarangi PP, Suvas S Regulatory T cells in virus infections. Immunol Rev. 2006 Aug; 212:272-86 This review discusses situations when the magnitude and function of immune responses to virus infection are influenced by regul atory T cells (Tregs). The focus is forkhead box protein 3+ natural Tregs (nTregs). The immune re sponse may be limited in magnitude and efficacy when animals with normal nTreg function are infect ed with virus. This limitation can be observed both in vitro and in vivo. In the case of herpes simplex virus (HSV), animals depleted of nTregs prior to infection more effectivel y control the virus. With some virus infections, Treg responses (either nTregs or interleukin-10- dependent adaptive Tregs) app ear to contribute to immune dysfunction, accounting for viral persistence and chronic tissue damage. This may occur with hepatitis C virus and some retrovirus infections that include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Under other circumstances, the nTreg response is judged to be beneficial, as it may help limit the severity of tissue damage associated with an immunoinflammatory reaction to virus infection. Such a situation occu rs in HSV-induced immunopathologi cal lesions in the eye. With HIV, nTregs may help limit chronic immune activ ation that may precede collapse of the immune system. This review also discusses how virus infections become rec ognized by nTreg responses 285and how such responses might be m anipulated to increase immunity or to limit virus-induced immunopathology REVIEW: Hammer, SM, Eron JJ, Reiss P et al.

C Mechanisms of nutrient modulation of the immune response J Allergy Clin Immunol 2005;115:1119-1128 Lack of adequate macronutrients or selected mi cronutrients, especially zinc, selenium, iron, and the antioxidant vitamins, can lead to clinically significant immune deficiency and infections in children. Undernutrition in criti cal periods of gestation and neonatal maturation and during weaning impairs the development and differentiati on of a normal immune system. Infections are both more frequent and more often become chronic in the malnourished child. Recent identification of genetic mechanisms is revealing critical pathways in the gastrointestinal immune response. New studies show that the development of tolerance, control of inflammation, and response to normal mucosal flora are interrelate d and linked to specific immune mechanisms. Nutrients act as antioxidants and as cofactors at the level of cy tokine regulation. Protein calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Increased circulating levels of glucocorticoids cause t hymic atrophy and affect hematopoiesis. Chronic undernutrition and micronutrient deficiency compromi se cytokine response and affect immune cell trafficking. The combination of chronic undernutri tion and infection further weakens the immune response, leading to altered imm une cell populations and a generali zed increase in inflammatory mediators. Obesity caused by excess nutrition or excess storage of fats relative to energy expenditure is a form of malnutrition that is incr easingly seen in children. Leptin is emerging as a cytokine-like immune regulator that has comp lex effects in both overnutrition and in the inflammatory response in malnutrition. Because the immune system is immature at birth, malnutrition in childhood might have long-term effects on health. REVIEW: 286Kim CH.

REVIEW: Pratt G, Goodyear O and Moss P. Immunode ficiency and immunotherapy in 138(5): 563-79. Multiple myeloma is a malignant tumor of plasma cells that remains incurable for the vast majority of patients, with a median survival of 2-3 years. It is characterized by the patchy accumulation of tumor cells within bone marrow leading to variab le anemia, bone destruction, hypercalcemia, renal failure and infections. Immune dysfunction is an important featur e of the disease and leads to infections that are both a major cause of morbid ity and mortality and may promote tumor growth 287and resistance to chemotherapy. Nume rous defects of the immune system have been described in multiple myeloma although the relative clinical im portance of these remains elusive. There has been considerable interest in the identification of an autolo gous response against myeloma. Although T cells and humoral responses directed ag ainst myeloma-associated antigens have been described, it is uncertain if the immune system pl ays a role in preventing or controlling myeloma cell growth. There is increasing in terest in the potential role of immunothera py but the success of these interventions is likely to be modified by the immunologically hostile environment associated with multiple myeloma.

Incidence of cancer after immunosuppressive treatment for heart transplantation. Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2005;56:101-13. Prolonged or intensive immunosuppressive therapy used after organ tr ansplantation is complicated by an increased incidence of cancer. Striking differences in incidence are observed in heart and heart-lung transplant recipients when compared w ith renal transplant pati ents. The most significant increase was in the incidence of lymphomas in cardiac versus renal patients. Moreover, a two-fold greater increase of all neoplasms was found in cardiac recipients, with nearly a six-fold increase in visceral tumors. Several factors may account for th ese differences. In cardi ac allograft recipients, intensive immunosuppression is frequently used to reverse acute rejection and the highest number of cardiac transplants was performed in the era of polypharmacy, usually consisting of triple therapy.

Comment in: N Engl J Med. 1998 Gorozny Medium- and large-vessel vasculitis N Engl J Med 2003;349:160-9 Despite differences in presentation and the clinical course, giant-cell arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and Takayasu's arteritis share many pa thogenic principles, and similar rules apply in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. The following discussion of pathogenic pathways will focus mostly on giant-cell arteritis, a reflection of the accessibility of inflamed vascular tissue that has facilitated m echanistic studies. REVIEW: Narula N, Gupta S, Narula J The Clin Pathol. 2005;124 :S84-95 Primary vasculitis is the inflammation and necrosis of vessel walls not asso ciated with infections, drugs, and autoimmune and lymphopr oliferative disorders. It is important to make the correct diagnosis of different types of vasculitis, as their prognosis may be significantly different. classification of vasculitis based on the size of the vessel is helpful, but there is often an overlap. Whereas the criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology are primarily clinical, the definitions set forth by the Chapel Hill C onsensus Conference are ba sed only on histologic observations. Correct diagnosis requires approp riate incorporation of the clinical history, laboratory parameters, and the histologic data. Incorporation of an tineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in defining the pathogenesis of vasculitis has been particularly useful in diagnosing those small vessel vasculitides that are life threatening and need immediate intervention. REVIEW Vasculitis diagnostic tests: Bosch X, Guilabert A, Font 2006;368:404-18 Much like other stranded DNA in syst emic lupus syndrome), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) have provided doctors with a useful serological test to assist in diagnosis of either proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase ar e clinically relevant, yet the relevance of other ANCA remains unknow n. Besides their diagnostic potential, ANCA might be valuable in disease monitoring. In a ddition, data seem to confirm the long-disputed pathogenic role of these antibodie s. Present treatments for ANCA-a ssociated vasculitis are not free from side-effects and as many as 50% of patients relapse within 5 years. Accurate understanding of the key pathogenic points of ANCA-associat ed vasculitis can undoubtedly provide a more rational therapeutic approach. REVIEW: Chung SA , Seo P Advances in the use of biologic agents fo r the treatment of sy stemic Curr Opin Rheumatol. 2009 Due to the well known toxicities of cyclophosphamide, substantial interest exists in finding other therapies to treat primary systemic vasculitis. Biologic agents have been proposed as an alternative to cyclophosphamide for these disorders because of their recent success in treating other rheumatic diseases. This article reviews the cu rrent state-of-the-art therapy with regards to the use of biologic agents as treatments for systemic vasculitis. RECENT FINDINGS: The greatest amount of e xperience with these agents fo r the treatment of systemic vasculitis is with antitumor necrosis factor agents, pooled intravenous anti- B-cell therapies such as rituximab. Intravenous immunoglobulin is already a standard therapy for Kawasaki's disease, but should also be considered for the treatment of vasculitis associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodi es when standard therapies are either ineffective or contraindicated. Early experience with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors indi cates that they may be effective for the treatment of Takayasu's arteritis, but their role in the treatment of other forms of vasculitis remains controversial. Early experience with rituximab for the treatment of several forms of vasculitis has been quite promisi ng, but must be confirmed by ongoing randomized clinical trials. SUMMARY: Biologic agents repres ent the next evolution in treatment for the primary systemic vasculitides. Greater understanding of these diseases has allowed us to move further away from nonspecific, hi ghly toxic therapies toward a mo re directed approach. As our experience with these agents increases, they will likely form the keystone of treatment in the near future. REVIEW: Phillip R Clin systemic vascu litis: a systematic review. There has been a considerable improvement in th e survival of patients with systemic vasculitis since the introduction of immunos uppressive therapy and improved diagnostic tools to allow earlier diagnosis. We review the published literature on current risk of mortality in patients with small vessel antineutroph il cytoplasm antibody- (ANCA) a of approximately 75% at 5 years), microscopic polyangiitis (survival rate of 45% to 75% at 5 ye ars), Churg-Strauss syndrome (survival rate of 68% to 100% at 5 years), and Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein pur pura (survival rate of 75% in adult-onset, greater childhood onset); medium vessel vasculitis cluding polyarteritis nodosa (survival rate of 75% to 80% at 5 years), Kawasaki disease (survival rate of greater than 99% at 5 years); large vessel vasculitis including giant cell arteritis (survival rate equivalent to the age-matched 291population), and Takayasu arteritis (survival of 70% to 93% at 5 ye ars). Mortality rates are falling as a result of m ore effective intervention but remain elevated substantially in severe disease. Early deaths are usually attributable to active vasculitis with multiorgan failure or infection, or both. The incidence of late deaths may be increased by lo ng-term effects of therapy and development of comorbidities. These findings highlight the need to improve early diagnosis and initiation of targeted therapy, thereby reducing treatm ent-related toxicity and can and does occur in childhood. t from the relatively common vasculitides (Henoch-Schonlein purpura, Kawasa ki disease and in world wide terms Takayasu disease) there are a number of important but comparatively rare disorders affecting children. These include macroscopic and microscopic polyarteritis, cuta neous polyarteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, disorders and vasculitis associated with conditions such as Behcets syndrome, familial Mediterranean fever and Cogan's syndrome. Disti nguishing these conditions from other disorders is often difficult and requires clinical acumen and appropriate investigative procedures. With modern therapeutic agents, it is pos sible to implement appropriate ther apy but in spite of this, there remains a not inconsequential morbidity and mortality. REVIEW: Zwerina J, A Syst ematic Literature Review and Clinical Compariso n with Adult Patients. Semin Arthritis Rheum. 2008 Jul 16. [Epub ahead of print] OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical character istics of children with Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) in comparison with adult patients. MATER IALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature analysis was performed in the Medline database up to November 2007 and in rheumatology and pulmonology meeting scientific abstracts 2003-2007. Artic les with reported childhood CSS cases were retrieved; clinical data were recorded. Desc riptive statistical analyses and a comparison with 2 published adult CSS cohorts were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-three cases of childhood CSS were identified. The mean age was 12 years and the male-to-female ratio was 0.74. All patients had significant eosinophilia and as thma. Histological evidence of eosinophilia and/or vasculitis was present in virtually all patie nts. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were found in 25% of children with CSS. Initial treatment was cort icosteroid monotherapy in 76% of childhood CSS patients, while 24% received additional immunos uppressive therapy. Another 18% required further immunosuppression at follow-up due to frequent rela pses. Six deaths (18%), all related to the underlying disease, occurred after a mean disease duration of 14 m onths. As compared with adult CSS patients, children had a predominance of ca rdiopulmonary disease manifestations, a lower rate of peripheral nerve involvement, and higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Many aspects of CSS are similar in childhood and adult patients. However, pulmona ry and cardiac involvement is predominant in pediatric CSS and mortality is substantial. 292REVIEW: Weiss PF a systematic Pediatrics. 2007 in: Pediatrics. 2008 Apr;121(4):870 -1; author reply 871-2. exists pediatricians or pedi atric rheumatologists regarding whether corticostero manifestations of Henoch- Sch\u00f6nlein purpura or mitigates renal injury. Th erefore, we sought to synthesize the reported experimental and observational da ta regarding corticosteroid use. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis based on a comprehensive review of the literature in the Me dline database (1956 to January 2007) and the Cochrane Controlled Tria ls Register. On the basis of reported outcomes among patients with Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura who were treated at diagnosis with corticosteroids compared with patients treated with supportive care only, we cal culated odds ratios for the resolution of abdominal pain, the need for surgic al intervention secondary to severe pain or intussusception, the likelihood of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura recurrence, and the development of transient or persistent renal dis ease. RESULTS: Of 201 articles retr ieved from the initial literature search, 15 were eligible for inclusion. Corticosteroid treatment did not reduce the median time to resolution of abdominal pain but did significantly reduce the mean resolution time and increased the odds of resolution within 24 hours. Early cort icosteroid treatment significantly reduced the odds of developing persistent renal disease. In ad dition, although the results were not statistically significant, the prospective data suggest reduced odds of both surgical intervention and recurrence.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospe ctive chart review of all patients diagnosed with WG at The Hospital for Sick Children between 1984 and 2005. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were identified. Median age at diagnosi s and median followup were 14.5 years and 32.7 months, respectively. Male -to-female ratio was 1:4. Median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 2 months. Of 22 patients, 21 were ANCA positive during their disease course (classic ANCA 78.9% ). Constitutional symptoms we re the most common clinical feature at presentation (24 of 25). Glomerulonephritis was presen t in 22 patients at presentation. Only 1 of 11 patients who presented with or developed renal impairment had normalization of serum creatinine.

Advances in Immunology: Autoimmune Diseases N Engl J Med 2001; 345:340-350 Autoimmune diseases, with the exception of rheu matoid arthritis and autoimmune thyroiditis, are individually rare, but together they affect approximately 5 per cent of the population in Western countries. They are a fascinating but poorly understood group of diseas es. In this review, we define an autoimmune disease as a clin ical syndrome caused by the activa tion of T cells or B cells, or both, in the absence of an ongoing infection or other discernible cause. We will discuss a classification of autoimmune disease that distin guishes diseases caused by generalized defects in lymphocyte selection or homeosta sis from those caused by aberrant responses to particular antigens. We will consider genetic susceptibility to autoimmune disease, environmental and internal triggers of au toreactivity, changes in pathologic proc esses as the disease progresses, and multiple mechanisms of tissue injury, and we w ill conclude with a survey of new therapeutic approaches. REVIEW: Lee, SJ. Kavanaugh, ct clinical syndromes character ized by various alterations in normal immune responsiveness, such that there is a loss of tolerance to particular host constituents. In most cases, despite years of intense investigation, the etiopa thogenic antigens initiating these systemic inflammatory conditions remain undefined. However, a great deal has been learned about the changes in components of the immune response relevant to the propagation and sustenance of these often chronic disorders. In addition, various hormonal, environmental, physiologic, and other influences that affect their expression have been identified. The expression and ultimate clinical outcome of autoimmune diseases us ually relate to inflammation-related damage to the target organ with subsequent dysfunction. Certain immune cond itions, such as autoimmune thyroid disease, largely affect a single organ, whereas others , such as systemic lupus erythematosus, heterogeneously affect sundry organ systems. Autoantibodies directed against normal host antigens are a common feat ure of many autoimmune diseases. In some cases they are pathogenic, whereas in others they serve as markers for orga n involvement or outcomes. Clinical descriptions of autoimmune diseases date back many decades in some cases. Recent efforts at formulating classification criteria have allowed clearer distin ctions and more accurate stratification. Greater understanding of the immunopathogenesis of autoi mmune conditions has led to the development and introduction into the clinic of novel immunomodulatory therapies and treatment paradigms that have substantially improved the outcomes fo r patients affected by these serious conditions. REVIEW: 294Schmerling RH Diagnostic tests for rheu matic dise ase: clinical utility revisited South Med J. 2005; 98:704-11 Establishing a diagnosis of syst emic rheumatic disease requires an integration of a patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and the results of diagnostic testing. There is often a temptation by clinicians to rely heavily on objectiv e measures such as the presence or absence of an autoantibody. Medical textbooks and the medical literature may overe stimate the diagnostic utility of many commonly ordered tests for rheu matic disease because the tests are usually analyzed among patients with established rheumatic disease rather than among patients with an uncertain cause of symptoms as is common in pr actice. Few diagnostic tests are highly sensitive, though the antinuclear antibody in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in temporal arteritis are notable exceptions. C onversely, few diagnostic tests are highly specific; anti-proteinase-3 and antimyeloperoxidase antibodies (typ es of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies) among patients with Wegener granulomatosis (and related vasculitides) and anti-double-stranded and an ti-Smith antibodies among patients with SLE may be particularly helpful in the proper clinical settings due to thei r high specificity. Anticitrullinated cyclic protein (anti-CCP), a newly described auto antibody that may be highly spec ific for rheumatoid arthritis, requires additional study as its utility in clinical practice is uncertain. THERAPY REVIEW: Scott D.L., Kingsley G.H. Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors for Rheumatoid Arthritis N Engl J Med 2006; 355:704-712 Rheumatoid arthritis developed in a 25-year-o ld woman, who was found to have a positive rheumatoid factor (150 IU per milliliter); she had no periarticular erosions disease. Oral methotrexate was st arted and incrementally increased to 20 mg weekly. Subsequently, sulfasalazine (Salazotyrin, Pharmacia; Azulfidine, Pfizer) was added and gradually increased to 2 g daily. Despite six months of combination therapy, she had 10 swollen and tender joints and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (54 mm per hour). Twelve months after onset, we were asked to evaluate her for possibl e tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Camps M, Ruckle T, Ji H, et al. Blockade of PI3K suppresses joint inflammation and damage in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis. Nat Med 2005;11:936-43. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) have long been considered promising drug targets for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diso rders as well as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. But the lack of specificity, isoform selectivity and poor biopharmaceutical profile of PI3K inhibitors have so far hampered rigorous disease-relevant target valid ation. Here we describe the identification and development of specific, selective and orally active smallmolecule inhibitors of PI3Kgamma (encoded by Pik3cg). We show th at Pik3cg(-/-) mice are largely protected in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis; this protection correlates w ith defective neutrophil migration, further validating PI3Kgamma as a ther apeutic target. We also describe that oral treatment with a PI3Kgamma inhibitor suppresse s the progression of joint inflammation and damage in two distinct mouse models of rheuma toid arthritis, reproducing the protective effects 295shown by Pik3cg(-/-) mice. Our results identify selec tive PI3Kgamma inhibitors as potential therapeutic molecules for the trea tment of chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Albana S, Prakken B T Cell Immune Therapy for Rheumatic Diseases Arthritis Rheum 2006; 54:19-25 The dramatic progress gained in molecula r immunology has enabled the evolution from traditional pharmacologic strategies of aggressive immune suppression to biologic-based therapies aimed at addressing the pathophysiol ogic process more directly. So far, the greatest progress has been achieved in the area of controlling indivi dual cytokine pathways that contribute to rheumatoid inflammation. In particular, biologic ag ents aimed at interferin g with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and, more recently, IL-6 have been very successful in various clinical settings None of thos e strategies, however, induces a sustained remission, and therefore none can fully restore homeostasis to the immune system. Consequently, lifelong treatment with such agents is necessary, which entails considerable costs and increases the risk of long-term side effects. Rising awareness of these problems has cr eated a consensus on the need for a therapeutic strategy that will capitalize more comprehensivel y on our understanding of the immunopathology of rheumatic diseases. In particul ar, pathways leading to adaptive autoimmunity need to be better exploited. Ideally, such approaches should be crafted so that they are complementary to the current cytokine-directed therapies. We will discuss herein the current status of therapeutic strategies aimed at correcting T cell-mediated inflammation. In particular, we will discuss our perspective regarding a T cell epitope- specific approach to restoration of naturally occurring mechanisms that modulate inflammation. REVIEW: Cope AP T cells in rheumatoid arthritis Arthritis Res Ther. 2008;10 Suppl 1:S1. Epub 2008 Oct 15 Over the past decade and a half, advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of immune- mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have translated di rectly into benefit for patients. Much of this benefit has arisen through the introduction of targeted biological therapies. At the same time, technological advances have made it possible to define, at the cellular and molecular levels, the key pathways that influe nce the initiation and pe rsistence of chronic inflammatory autoimmune reactions. As our understanding grows, it is likely that this knowledge will be translated into a second generation of bi ological therapies that are tailor-made for the patient. This review summarizes current perspectives on RA disease pathogenesis, with particular emphasis on what RA T cells look like, what they ar e likely to see, and how they contribute to persistence of the chroni c inflammatory response. REVIEW: H\u00fcgle T, van Laar JM. Stem cell transplantation eumatic autoimmune diseases. Arthritis Res Ther. 2008;10(5):217. Epub 2008 Oct 10. 296Immunoablative therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSC T) is an intensive treatment modality aimed at 'resetting' the dys regulated immune system of a patient with immunoablative therapy and allow outgrowth of a nonautogressive immune system from reinfused hematopoietic stem cells, either from the patien t (autologous HSCT) or a healthy donor (allogeneic HSCT). HSCT has been shown to induce profound a lterations of the immune system affecting B and T cells, monocytes, and natural killer and dendritic cells, resulti ng in elimination of autoantibody-producing plasma cells and in inducti on of regulatory T cells. Most of the available data have been collected through retrospective cohort analyses of autologous HSCT, case series, and translational studies in patients with refr actory autoimmune diseases. Long-term and marked improvements of disease activity have been observed, notably in systemic scle rosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and juvenile idiopathic arthriti s, and treatment-related morbidity and mortality have improved due to better patient selection and modifications of transplant regimens. Treatment- related mortality has decreased to approximately 7%. Prospective, randomised, controlled clinical trials are ongoing or planned in systemic sclerosi s, systemic lupus erythematosus, and several non- rheumatological conditions. REVIEW: Rhodes B, Vyse TJ. The genetics of SLE: an update in the light of genome-wide association studies. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2008 Nov; 47(11):1603-11. Epub 2008 Jul 8. Understanding the pathogenesis of SLE remains a considerable challenge. Multiple abnormalities of both the innate and adaptiv e immune system have been described and, furthermore, immunological dysfunction precedes clinical presentation by many year s. There is a strong genetic basis to SLE, which means that genetic studies can play a key role in fu rthering our understanding of this disease. Since susceptibility variants are present from birth and are unaffected by the course of the disease, or by its treatment, genetic anal ysis is, perhaps uniquel y, capable of identifying fundamental, causative, disease mechanisms. Over th e last 12 months, there has been a staggering increase in our understanding of SLE genetics. We have seen the identification of new and important SLE susceptibility genes through candi date gene studies, a nd we have seen the publication of two whole-genom e association analyses. The 'hypothesis free' whole-genome studies have provided additional evidence in support of a number of existing susceptibility genes and have identified novel gene candidates. In this article, we review the current SLE genetics literature in the light of these recent advances and we discuss our current understanding of the functional role of the key suscepti bility genes. By considering how these genes fall into clusters with shared function we can begin to unders tand how dysregulation at a number of key immunological steps may predispose to the development of SLE. 3. Immune renal disorders REVIEW: Nangaku M, Mouser WG. Mechanisms of immune-deposit formation an d the mediation of immune renal injury. Clin Exp Nephrology 2005;9:183-91 The passive trapping of preformed immune co mplexes is responsible for some forms of glomerulonephritis that are associated with mesa ngial or subendothelial deposits. The biochemical characteristics of circulating antigens play importa nt roles in determining the biologic activity of immune complexes in these cases. Examples of circulating immune comple x diseases include the 297classic acute and chronic serum sickness models in rabbits, and hum an lupus nephritis. Immune deposits also form \"in situ\". In situ immune deposit formation may occur at subepithelial, subendothelial, and mesangial sites. In situ immu ne-complex formation has been most frequently studied in the Heymann nephritis models of me mbranous nephropathy with subepithelial immune deposits. While the autoantigenic target in Heyma nn nephritis has been identified as megalin, the pathogenic antigenic target in human membra nous nephropathy had been unknown until the recent identification of neutral endopeptidase as one target. It is likely that there is no universal antigen in human membranous nephropathy. Immune complexes can damage glomerular structures by attracting circulating inflammatory cells or activating resident glomer ular cells to release vasoactive substances, cytokines, and activators of coa gulation. However, the principal mediator of immune complex mediated glomerular injury is the complement system, especially C5b-9 membrane attack complex formation. C5b-9 inserts in sublytic quantities into the membranes of glomerular cells, where it produces cell activ ation, converting normal cells into resident inflammatory effector cells that cause injury. Ex cessive activation of the complement system is normally prevented by a series of circulati ng and cell-bound complement regulatory proteins. Genetic deficiencies or mutations of these proteins can lead to the spontaneous development of glomerular disease. The identification of specific antigens in human disease may lead to the development of fundamental therapies. Particul arly promising future therapeutic approaches include selective immunosuppression and interference in complement activation and C5b-9-me diated cell injury. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Gomez-Guerrero C, Lopez-Franco O, Sanjuan G et al. Suppressors of cytokine signaling regulate Fc receptor signaling and cell activation during immune renal injury. J Immunol 2004;172:6969-77. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) are cytokine-inducible via kinase pathways. We inve stigate the role of SOCS in renal disease, analyzing whether SOCS regulate IgG receptor (F cgammaR) signal pathways. In experimental models of immune complex (IC) glomerulonephritis, the renal expression of SOCS family genes, mainly SOCS-3, significantly increased, in parall el with proteinuria and renal lesions, and the proteins were localized in glom eruli and tubulointerstitium. Induc tion of nephritis in a deficiency in the FcgammaR ga mma-chain (gamma(-/-) mice) resulted in a decrease in the renal expression of SOCS-3 and SOCS-1. Moreover, blockade of FcgammaR by Fc fragment administration in rats with ongoing nephritis human mesangial cells (MC) and monocytes, IC caused a rapid and transient induction of SOCS-3 expression. Similar kinetics was observed for SOCS- 1, whereas SOCS-2 expression was very low. MC from gamma(-/-) mice failed to respond to IC activation, confirming the participation of FcgammaR. Interestingly, IC i nduced tyrosine phosphorylation of lated MC, suggesting intracellular association. IC also activated STAT pathway in MC, which was suppressed by SOCS overexpression, mainly inhibited mesangi al SOCS-3 expression, leading to an increase in the ICinduced STAT activation. Our results indicate that SO CS may play a regulat ory role in FcgammaR 298signaling, and implicate SOCS as im portant modulators of cell ac tivation during renal inflammation. 4. Immune endocrine and reproductive disorders REVIEW: Klein JR. The immune system as regulator of thyroid hormone activity. Exp Biology and Medicine 2006;231:229-36. It has been known for decades that the neuroendo crine system can both directly and indirectly influence the developmental and functional activity of the immune system. In contrast, far less is known about the extent to which the immune syst em collaborates in the regulation of endocrine activity. This is particularly true fo r immune-endocrine interactions of the hypothalamuspituitarythyroid axis. Although thyroi d-stimulating hormone (TSH) can be produced by man types of extrapituitary cells--including T cells, B cells, splenic dendritic cells, bone marrow hematopoietic cells, in testinal epithelial cells, and lymphocytes--the functional significance of those TSH pathways remains elusive and historically has been largely ignored from a research perspective. There is now, however, ev idence linking cells of the immune system to the regulation of thyroid hormone activity in normal physiological conditions as well as during times of immunological stress. Although the mechanisms behind this are poorly understood, they appear to reflect a process of local intrathyroidal sy nthesis of TSH mediated by a population of bone marrow cells that traffic to the thyroid. This h itherto undescribed cell popul ation has the potential to microregulate thyroid hormone secretion leading to critical alterations in metabolic activity independent of pituitary TSH output, and it ha s expansive implicati ons for understanding mechanisms by which the immune system may act to modulate neuroendocrine function during times of host stress. In this article, the basic underpinnings of the hematopoietic-thyroid connection are described, and a mode l is presented in which the immune system participates in the regulation of thyroid hormone ac tivity during acute infection. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Tsuchida K. Activins, myostatin and related TGF-beta fam ily as novel therapeutic targets for endocrine, metabolic a nd immune disorders. Current Disorders 2004;4:157-66. Activins and inhibins were first id entified by virtue of their ability to regulate follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion from the anterior pituitary. Activins are also powerful regulators of gonadal functions. However, the physiological f unctions of activins ar e not restricted to reproductive tissues. Activins are involved in ap optosis of hepatocytes and B cells, fibrosis, inflammation and neurogenesis. Activins are regard ed as novel drug target s since blocking activins would provide benefits by preventing apoptosis , fibrosis, inflammation and growth of several cancers. Activins are members of the transformi ng growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family, which has numerous peptide growth and differentiation factors including activins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), growth and differentiation f actors (GDFs) and TGF-betas. Among them, GDF8 is also known as myostatin and is structurally related to activins. Myostatin is specifically expressed in the skeletal musc le lineage and is a candidate for muscle chalone negatively regulating the growth of myoblasts. Myostatin is regarded as a good drug target since therapeutics that modulate skeletal muscle growth would be us eful for disease conditions such as muscular 299dystrophy, sarcopenia, cachexia and even diabetes. Recent stu dies have revealed that activins and myostatin signal through ac tivin type II receptors (ActRIIA and ActRIIB) a nd their activities are regulated by extracellular binding proteins, follistatins and follistatin-related gene (FLRG). Furthermore, signaling of activins, myostatin re lated ligands is also controlled by intracellular receptor-interacting proteins by novel mechanisms. In this review, I would like to show the current progress in the field emphasizing the importance of activins and myostati n as novel drug targets for immune, endocrine and metabolic disorders. REVIEW: A. Fischer, O. Goulet, and C. Bodemer, manifestations of immune (IPEX) Immune dysregulation, syndrome zed by neonatal autoimmune enteropathy, diabetes and thyroiditis, food allergies and skin rash. IP EX syndrome is caused by mutations in FOXP3, a master control gene of regulatory T cells (Tregs), resulting in abse nt or dysfunctional Tregs. Data in the literature are scarce and the cutane ous manifestations are rarely depicted. Objectives: To evaluate the fre quency and characteristics of cu taneous manifestations found in IPEX. METHODS: Retrospective single-centre study of a case series of IPEX. Patients' data were retrieved from medical files and numerous pa rameters concerning ge neral and cutaneous characteristics of the disease were recorded. RESULTS: Ten children with IPEX were studied. Cutaneous involvement was present in seven of 10 chidren; age at onset was 0-4 months, median 1\u00c65. All patients presented with atopic dermatitis (AD). Three presente d more psoriasiform lesions. Eczema was severe; most affected areas were lower limbs, trunk and face. Pruritus was present in four of seven, and painful fissurary cheilitis in four of se ven. Hyper-IgE was found in seven of 10 and hypereosinophilia in five of 10. Skin biopsies showed eczematiform or psoriasiform features. Affected patients were improved by dermocorticoids; no clear improvement was obtained with immunosuppressive regimens. Othe r features were urticar ia secondary to food allergies and staphylococcal sepsis, mostly Staphylococcus aureus and catheter related. CONCLUSION: AD seems to be a frequent finding in IPEX syndrome, which is characterized by Treg anomalies. This hints to a possible role of Tr egs in AD, which is then discussed in this study. Eisenbarth GS and Gottlieb PA Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndromes N Engl J Med 2004;350:2068-79. The autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes are diverse, and their diversity is a characteristic that is both clinically important and instructive when their basic immunologic features are considered (Table 1). These syndromes include monogenic disorders (such as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I, which has classi c and characteristic disease a ssociations and complex genetic disorders (such as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrom e type II, in which the component diseases are more variable Some of the component disorders are common (e.g., th yroid autoimmunity and celiac disease), whereas others ar e rare (e.g., Addison's disease and myasthenia gravis). Some of the disorders are usually asymptomatic (e.g., celiac disease); others are sy mptomatic but typically diagnosed after years of illness (Addison's disease, which features severe fatigue and nausea, and pernicious anemia, which causes neuropathic symptoms ); and still others are clinically dramatic at 300the time of diagnosis (type 1A diabetes, also known as immune-m ediated diabetes and formerly called insulin-dependent diabetes). The term \"pol yendocrine\" itself is a misnomer, in that not all patients have multiple endocrine disorders, and many have nonendocrine autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, the recognition that patients in w hom multiple autoimmune disorders are diagnosed may have a specific genetic syndrome, may be at increased risk for multiple autoimmune disorders, and may have relatives who have an in creased risk should spur clinicians toward early diagnosis and treatment. A general question concerning the autoimmune polyendocrine disorders relates to the shared \"antigen\" that can result in th e targeting of multiple tissues. In fact, it is likely that the affected organs and tissues do not shar e any specific molecule bu t rather have different molecules that are more or less likely to be target s when the immune system fails to maintain self- tolerance to a variety of molecules, in particular specific peptid es within target organs (Fig. 1). In addition, specific genetic polymorphisms influence wh ich specific diseases develop; for example, a polymorphism of the insulin gene related to the thymic expression of insulin alters the risk of type 1A diabetes but not the risk of other autoimmune disorders. REVIEW: Owen CJ, Jennings CF, Imrie H, et al Mutational Analysis of the FOXP3 Gene and Evidence for Genetic Heterogeneity in (IPEX), is a rare disorder of immune regulation resulting in multiple autoimmune disorders, which demonstrates X-linked recessive inheritance. The disease gene, FOXP3, was identified in 2001, and several mutations within this gene have since b een described in patients with IP EX. We used linkage analysis, mutational screening of the FOXP3 gene, human leukocyte antigen typing, and analysis of X- chromosome inactivation to investig ate 2 kindreds (21 subjects in total) with 4 male infants (3 now deceased) and 1 girl affected by IPEX. In 1 family a novel FOXP3 mutation was identified in the proband, with a single base deletion at codon 76 of exon 2, leading to a frameshift, which predicted a truncated pr otein product (108 residues vs. 431 in wild type). In the second family, the FOXP3 locus was excluded by recombination, and muta tional analysis of the gene was negative. The affected girl from this family was show n to have human leukocyte antigen DR2 and DR6 alleles and random X-chromosome inactivation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Dendritic cells (DC) have a centr al role in the ini tiation of adequate im mune responses. They recognize pathogens by means of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and link innate to adaptive immune responses by releasing proinflammatory cytokine s and inducing T cell pro liferation. We conducted this study to evaluate the expression and functio n of TLR on human lung DC subsets and to study 301their T cell stimulatory capacity. TLR gene expr ession by huma n pulmonary DC was evaluated by RT-PCR, while protein expression was analyzed by flow cytometr y. We investigated cytokine release by DC in response to different TLR ligan ds. T cell stimulatory capacity was evaluated by mixed leukocyte reactions of purified lung DC with allogeneic T cells.

Adoptiv e transfer of the Tr cells to another set of presensitized mice mediated suppression of the e fferent phase of Th1 immune response and the subsequent immune dependent pulm onary interstitial fibrosis. T hus, tol-APC induced efferent CD8+ Tr cells in immune mice, and the re gulation of the immune response limited the development of autoimmune pulmonary fibrosis in sensitized and pulmonary-challenged mice. Because ADT-HIPIF shares etiological and pathol ogical characteristics with a variety of human immune inflammatory conditions in the lung that eventuate into in terstitial fibrosis, these studies provide insight into potential therapy to alter the course of pulmonary fibrosis in humans. REVIEW: M Aydogan, Patients With Common Variable Immunodeficiency ciency (CVID) is the term used to describe a heterogeneous group of B-cell defi ciency s yndromes characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, and recurrent bacter ial infections. OBJECTIV E: To determine the clinical m anifestations and pe rform an immunological analysis of pediatric CVID patients suffering from respiratory complications. METHODS : The records of 10 patients with CVID who were followed up from 1992 to 2005 (6 males and 4 females) with a median (interquartile range) age of 13.9 (10.4-19.4) years were review ed. All patients met the standa rd criteria set for CVID. RESULTS: Median total serum levels of immuno globulin (Ig) G, IgM, and IgA in mg/dL were 383.5 (239.2-574.5), 32.5 (17.0-117.0), a nd 12.5 (5.0-30.7), respectively. Me dian age at the onset of symptoms, at CVID diagnos is, and on starting intravenous Ig therapy was 4.0 (0.8-6.2), 9.4 (6.7-11.3), and 9.1 (7.0-11.6) years, re spectively. Associated disorder s were recurrent infections (100%), bronchiectasis (90%), infl ammatory bowel disease, a nd autoimmune disorders were less common. All bronchiectatic patients had a low percentage of B cells, with an average of 4% (range, 1%-7%). The characteristic computed tomography fi nding in patients with CVID was a multilobar pattern. Malignant neoplasm developed an average of 11. 5 (range, 6.5-20.2) years af ter the diagnosis of CVID was made. CONCLUSION: Recu rrent respiratory infection shoul d be evaluated to rule out CVID. Early diagnosis and intravenous Ig repl acement therapy may reduce the frequency of respiratory infection. Low levels of serum Ig a nd percentage of B lymphocytes at diagnosis are important parameters for identifying patie nts at risk of stru ctural lung damage. 6.

Auto-anti bodies to mitochondrial antigens (AMAs) subunit of th e pyruvate dehydrogenase complex represent the hallmark antibody for the diagnosis of PBC, whereas antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) with low disease specificity are found in up to 50% of these sera. Antib odies that recognize nuclear envelope proteins exert a similarl y high diagnostic specificity as AMA in PBC but occur at a rather low prevalence. The role of auto-antibodies is le ss well-studied for patients with PSC, but there is growing evidence that only antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies(ANCAs) are of relevant diagnostic significance. In contra st, auto-antibodiesparticularlyAM As-do not contribute to the diagnosis of auto-immune cholangitis, whereas ANCAs,ANAs, smooth muscle antibodies, and AMAs are of varying significance in PBC-auto immune hepatitis (AIH) or PSC-AIH overlap syndromes. It has been widely accepted that the c ourse of the auto-antibody serum end point titers are not suited for the clinical management of pa tients with chronic cholestatic liver disorders. Additionally, autoantibodies in these di sorders usually do no t contribute to the immunopathogenesis of the disease. REVIEW: Farrell RJ, and gl uten-sensitive enteropathy, is characterized by malabsorption resulting from inflammatory injury to the mucosa of the small intestine after the ingestion of wheat gluten or related rye and ba rley proteins. There is clinical and histologic improvement on a strict gluten-fr ee diet, and relapse when dietary gluten is reintroduced. Accounts of celiac sprue date back to the first century A. D. It was not until the 1940s, however, that the link to gluten ingestion was established; Dicke, a Dutch pediatrician, observed that the condition of children with celiac sprue improved during the f ood shortages of World War II, only to relapse after cereal supplies were restored. Until fairly recently, celiac sprue was considered uncommon in the United States, with an estimated preval ence of 1 per 3000 population. However, greater awareness of its presentations and the availability of new, accurate serologic tests have led to the realization that celiac sp rue is relatively common, affecting 1 of every 120 to 300 persons in both Europe and North America. REVIEW: Xavier R.J., Podolsky D.K. Unravelling the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 448:427-34, 2007 Recently, substantial advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been made owing to thr ee related lines of inves tigation. First, IBD has been found to be the most tractable of complex di sorders for discovering susceptibility genes, and these have shown the importance of epithelial barrier function, and innate and adaptive immunity in disease pathogenesis. Second, efforts directed towards the identification of environmental factors implicate commensal bacteria (or their pr oducts), rather than conventional pathogens, as drivers of dysregulated immunity and IBD. Thir d, murine models, which exhibit many of the features of ulcerative colitis and seem to be bacteria-driven, have helped unravel the pathogenesis/mucosal immunopathology of IBD. REVIEW: SR. tion and classificati on: state-of-the art approach. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology. 23:390-4, 2007 Jul. Progress in inflammatory bowel di sease, aided by use of animal models, and focused on pathways leading to inflammation and the relationship between the innate a nd adaptive immune systems, is identifying target pathogenic mechanisms for therapeutic intervention. This review will describe the most recent advances and discuss promising pathways for therapeutic discovery. RECENT FINDINGS: Identification and testing of immune a nd genetic markers to distinguish subgroups of patients with inflammatory bowel disease have su rged over the last decade. What was limited to a few serum antibodies is now complemented with a number of genetic associations. Recent years have seen renewed interest, with additional evidence on the relationship between intestinal commensal bacteria and the inflammatory pro cess in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. SUMMARY: There is emerging evidence that discriminating pathogenic abnormalities are present in certain clusters of patients, defined by selected immune re sponses. These traits have been used to identify correlates between relevant m ouse models and immunophenotypic cl usters of patients. Such approaches will not only help us to more easily define groups of patient s for study, but will also 304enhance our understanding of the interface betwee n various pa thways and disease expression, and ultimately, identify the primal therapeutic targ ets in the appropriate subgroups of patients. 7. Immune neurologic and neuromuscular disorders REVIEW: Lutterotti A. Martin R. Getting specific: monoclonal antibodies in multiple sclerosis. Lancet Neurology. 7:538-47, 2008 For more than a decade the only th erapies that were available for multiple sclerosis (MS) were two immunomodulatory drugs-inte rferon antibody against alpha4 integrin, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the Eur opean Medicines Agency on the basis of its higher efficacy than the available treatments and its good safety profile. Monoclonal antibodies that are already licensed to treat other diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases, are being tested for the treatment of MS. Additionally, novel targets are currently being investigated for MS. The therapeutic use of monoclonal antibodies was initially viewed w ith great scepticism owing to the high rates of sensitisation ag ainst mouse proteins, their phar macokinetic properties, and the difficulties in their production. However, most of these problems have been overcome, and monoclonal antibodies are now among the most promising therapies for MS. REVIEW: Skeie GO, Apostolski S, Evoli A et al.

New clinical synthetases, anti- signal recognition particles and anti -Mi-2) are also described. The possibility was raised that the high expression of myositis-specific autoantigens in regenerating muscle cells and certain cancers may be involved in initiating and perpetuati ng the autoimmune response in myositis. SUMMARY: Myositis-specific autoantibodies are useful markers for clinical diagnosis, classification and predicting prognosis of idiopathic inflammato ry myopathy.

The immune system works through leukocytes interac ting with each other, w ith other cells, with tissue matrices, with infectious agents, and with other antigens. These interactions are mediated by cell-surface glycoproteins and glycolipids. Antib odies against these leukocyte molecules have provided powerful tools for analys is of their structure, function, and distribution. Antibodies have been used widely in hematology, immunology, and pathology, and in research, diagnosis, and therapy. The associated CD nome nclature is commonly used when referring to leukocyte surface molecules and antibodies against them. It provide s an essential classifi cation for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The most recent (8th) Workshop and Conference on Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens (HLDA), held in Adelai de, Australia, in December 2004, allocated 95 new CD designations and made radical changes to its aims and future opera tional strategy in order to maintain its relevance to modern human biology and clinical practice. 306 FRONTIER: Elstrom RL , Martin Oncol phoma has trad consisted of cytotoxic chemotherapy, which can frequently induce remissions but less re liably delivers long-ter m disease-free survival. The last two decades have heralded an era of increasing exploration of therapies derived from improved biologic understanding of tumors a nd tumor-host interactions, including the development of therapeutic tactics that take adva ntage of immune mechanisms to target and kill tumors. Foremost among these has been the deve lopment of monoclonal an tibodies. Currently, an array of novel therapeutics in development may improve outcomes further, including novel monoclonals and other agents that take advantage of or optimize immune system function in the treatment of lymphoma or that provide other mechanisms of antitumor activity. 9.

The era of biologic medical therapies provides new options for patients with treatment-resistant inflammatory eye disease. In this review, the authors summarize current published experience in a rapidly progressing clinical field, in cluding the use of biologics, such as the tumour necrosis factor blockers, daclizumab and rituximab, and related agents, and for the treatment of uveitis, scleritis and orbi tal inflammation. Reports of dramatic recoveries in patients with recalcitrant ocular inflam mation who have received such therapies must be balanced against the high cost of biologics and the potential for serious, and at times unanticipated, complications of this treatment 10.

FRONTIER: O'Regan GM, Sandilands, McLean J recent identification of loss- of-function m utations in the structural protein filaggrin as a widely replicated major risk factor for eczema sheds new light on disease mechanisms in eczema, a disease that had heretofore largely been considered to have a primarily immunologic etiopathogenesis. The filaggrin gene (FLG) mutation findings are consistent with a recently proposed unifying hypothesis that offers a m echanistic understanding of eczema pathogenesis synthesizing a t diminished epidermal defense mechanisms to allergens and microbes, followed by polarized T(H)2 lymphocyte responses with resultant chronic inflammation, including autoimmune mechanisms. Although compelling evidence from genetic studies on FLG implicates pe rturbed barrier function as a key player in the pathogenesis of eczema in many patients, much is still unknown about the sequence of biologic, physicochemical, and aberrant regulatory events th at constitute the transition from an inherited barrier defect to clinical manifestations of in flammatory eczematous lesions and susceptibility to related atopic disorders. The exact contribution of FLG to the wider atopic story, factors modifying FLG expression, and the role of othe r barrier proteins remain to be delineated. In this review we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the FLG genetics in the cause of eczema and related complex diseases. 308D. Transplantation Medicine 1. Recognition of alloantigens REVIEW: Robert I. Lechler, Oliver A. Garden, Laurence A. Turka The complementary roles of deletion and regulation in transplantation tolerance Nature Reviews Immunology 3, 147 - 158 (01 Feb 2003) Neonatal tolerance of alloantigens was descri bed in mice nearly half a century ago, but unfortunately, the translation of th ese early findings into the clinical arena proved to be much more challenging than was first anticipated. However, th e past decade has seen considerable progress in our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to transplantation tole rance in experimental models. This review outlines our current understandi ng of the mechanisms of allograft tolerance, emphasizing the complementary roles of deletio n and regulation of alloreactive T cells. 2. Alloreactive T cell activation REVIEW: Patrick T. Walsh 1, Terry B. Strom 2 and Laurence A. Turka Routes to Transplant Tolerance versus Rejection The Role of Cytokines Immunity. 2004 Feb;20(2):121-31 Abstract The alloimmune response can be divided into specific junctures where critical decisions between tolerance and immunity are made which define the outcome of the transplant. At these \"decision nodes\" various cytokines direct alloresponsive T cells to develop either a proinflammatory response aimed at graft de struction or an immunor egulatory response facilitating graft acceptance. This review w ill focus on the role of these cytokines in influencing the progression of an alloimmune re sponse leading ultimately to either allograft survival or rejection. 3. Allograft rejection RESEARCH FRONTIER: Heidt S, San D, Chadha, R, et al The impact of Th17 cells on transplant rejection and the induction of tolerance Curr Opin Organ Transplant. 2010 15:456-461 This review aims to provide an overview of the latest evidence for the involvement of Th17 cells in the rejection of solid organ all ografts. It will also consider th e implications of the relationship between the differentiation pathwa ys of Th17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs), as well as their plasticity in the context of tr ansplantation tolerance. Recent fi ndings: In the absence of the Th1 lineage in vivo, Th17 cells are capab le of rejecting cardiac allogr afts, showing the capacity of Th17 cells to cause allogr aft rejection, at least in experiment al models. Th17 cells are relatively unsusceptible to suppression by Tregs, although th is may be context dependent. Furthermore, addition of inflammatory signals to a Treg-inducing environment leads to Th17 development and established Tregs can be converted to Th17 cells under inflammatory conditions. SUMMARY: The capacity of Th17 cells to cause allograft rej ection is becoming increa singly clear. However, 309the role and contribution of Th17 cells in allograft reject ion in the presence of the full orchestra of T helper cells remains elusive. The apparent resistance of Th17 to be suppressed by Tregs m ay pose a hurdle for effective immunosuppression and to lerance inducing protocols. Furthermore, the close developmental pathways of Th17 and Tregs and the ability of Tregs to convert into Th17 cells in the presence of inflammatory signals may impede the establishment of specific unresponsiveness to donor alloantigens in al Humoral immunity in renal transplantation: clinical and therapeutic approach Clin Transplant 2008: 22: 689-699. Donor-specific antibodies (DSA) form a significant barrier in solid organ transplantation of highly pre-sensitized candidates. Alt hough avoiding transplantation over a positive cross-match test can largely prevent the occurrence of hyperacute antibody-mediated rejection, transpla ntation of highly pre-sensitized candidates is often complicated by the occurrence of acute and chronic antibody- mediated graft rejection leading to diminished graft function and survival. The pre-existent HLA and/or non-HLA-specific antibodies are withou t any doubt important contributing factors underlying humoral-mediated graft injury. Furt hermore, increasing evidence underlines the association of newly formed de novo DSA after transplantation with poor graft function and survival. There is still a need to further deve lop desensitizing therapies not only to make transplantation of highly presensi tized candidates feasible, but also to reduce the new formation of alloantibodies. Here, we summarize current views on desensitization therapies and the impact of the presence of DSA on the fate of the kidney graft. b. Acute REVIEW: Singh N, Pirsch J, Sarmaniego M Antibody-mediated rejection: treatme nt alternatives and outcomes. Transplant Rev (Orlando). 2009;23:34-46 Over the past 10 years, thanks to the developm ent of sensitive methods of antibody detection and markers of antibody injury such as C4d staining, the role of anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA alloantibodies as effectors of acute and chronic immune allograft injury has been revisited. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) define s all allograft rejecti on caused by antibodies directed against donor-specific HLA molecules, blood group antigen (ABO)-isoagglutinins, or endothelial cell antigens. Antibody-mediated rejecti on can be a recalcitrant process, resistant to therapy and carries an ominous prognosis to the graft. In concorda nce with these views, treatment protocols for AMR use permutations of a multiple-prong approach that include (1) the suppression of the T-cell dependent antibody response, (2) th e removal of donor reactive antibody, (3) the blockade of the residual allo antibody, and (4) the depletion of naive and memory B-cells. Although all published protocols report a variable rate of success, a major weakness of all current protocols is the lack of effective anti-plasm a cell agents. In comparison to acute AMR, the treatment for chronic AMR (CAMR) is not well characterized. Alt hough in acute AMR large titers of pre-existent alloantibodies result in massive activation of the complement system and lytic injury of the graft endothelium, thereby requiring aggressive and fast removal of the offending agents, in CAMR, complement activ ation results in sublytic endothe lial cell injury and activation. 310Although this type of injury results in chronic gr aft failure, its slow progr ession likely renders it amenable of suppression by heightening of ma intenance immunosuppression and anti-idiotypic blockade of the circulating allo antibody without the need of plasma exchange. In this review, we will discuss the rationale behind the design of treatment protocols for acute AMR and CAMR as well as their reported results and complications. c. Chronic REVIEW: Inguilli E. Mechanisms of cellular rejection in transplantation Pediatr Nephrol 2010 25:61-74 The explosion of new discoveries in the fiel d of immunology has provided new insights into mechanisms that promote an immune response directed against a transplanted organ. Central to the allograft response are T lymphocytes. This revi ew literature on allorecognition, costimulation,memory Tcells, Tcellm igration, and their role in both acute and chronic graft destruction. An in depth understandi ng of the cellular mechanisms that result in both acute and chronic allograft rejection will provide ne w strategies and targeted therapeutics capable of inducing long-lasting, allo graft-specific tolerance REVIEW: Nephrol. 2001 Sep;21(5):498-507. The major histocompatibility complex molecu les are the primary antigens responsible for causing graft rejection, a nd T-cell recognition of alloantigens is the cardinal event initiating cellular rejection. Current concepts suggest that direct allorec ognition mediates acute rejection, whereas indirect allorecognition mediates chronic rejection. In biopsy tissue of rejecting human renal allografts, several cytotoxic T-lymphocyt e molecules are upregulated. The net result of cytokine release and the acquisiti on of cell surface recept ors is the emergence of antigen-specific and graft-destructive T cells. Acute rejection is more frequent in children than in adults. By the end of the first year posttransplantation, 45% of living donor recipients and 60% of cadaver donor recipients will have an episode of rejection. In recent years, with improved immunosuppressive therapy, the incidence of acute re jection is decreasing at a rate of about 8% each year, however, chronic rejection graft loss has increased to 41% of all graft losses in the last 2 years. The mechanisms leading to chronic re jection and attempts to reduce acu te rejections should provide a better half-life to children postrenal transplantation. REVIEW: Peter Libby and Jordan S.

Prevention and treatment of allograft rejection REVIEW: Robert I Lechler1, Megan Sykes2, An gus W Thomson3 & Laurence A Turka4 Organ transplantation\u2014how much of the promise has been realized? Nature Medicine 11, 605 - 613 (2005) Since the introduction of organ tran splantation into medical practi ce, progress and optimism have been abundant. Improvements in immunosuppressive drugs and ancillary care have led to outstanding short-term (1-3-year) patient and graft survival rates. This success is mitigated by several problems, including poor long-term (>5-year) graft survival rates, the need for continual immunosuppressive medication and the discrepa ncy between the demand for organs and the supply. Developing methods to induce transplant to lerance, as a means to improve graft outcomes and eliminate the requirement for immunosuppression, and expanding the pool of organs for transplantation are the major challenges of the field. a. Immunosupression REVIEW: Durrbach A, Francois H, Beaudreuil S, et al. Advances in immunosuppression for renal transplantation Nat Rev Nephrol 2010; 6:160-167 The development of immunosuppressants with mi nimal adverse and nephrotoxic effects is important to improve outcomes, such as acute an d chronic antibody-mediated rejection, after organ transplantation. In addition, the application of expanded criteria for donors and transplantation in immunized patients necessitates the development of new therapies. Drug development over the past 10 years has generally been disappointing, but several new promising compounds have been or are being developed to prevent acute and chronic transp lant rejection. In th is Review, we report on several compounds that have been developed to remove allogenic T cells and/or to inhibit T- cell activation. We also discuss compounds that interfere with antibody-mediated rejection. Duncan MD, Wilkes DS Transplant-related immunosuppression: a rev iew of immunosuppression and pulmonary infections. Proc Am Thorac Soc. 2005;2(5):449-55. Solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are defin itive therapies for a variety of end-stage diseases. Immunosuppression has improve d graft survival but leaves the patient susceptible to infectious complications. Of these, pulmonary infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the transplant recipien t. Allograft rejection is mediated primarily by T cells, with B cells playing a role via anti body production. Depending on the transplant type, rejection can be hyperacute, acute , or chronic. Hyperacute rej ection occurs as an immediate response to preformed antibodies to donor human leukocyte antigens. Ac ute cellular rejection involves recipient T-cell rec ognition of human leukocyte antige n molecules expressed irect allorecognition) or presen donor-derived peptides by recipient antigen-presenting cells to recipien t T cells (indirect allorecognition). Once the alloantigens are recognized as foreign, the activation, pr oliferation, and producti on of cytokines by T lymphocytes and other immune cells lead to th e amplification of the alloimmune response. This complex process involves the generation of e ffector T cells, antibody production by activated B 312cells, and macrophage activation. Alloimmunity is facilitated by the produc tion of ma ny cytokines, chemokines, and other effector molecules, such as complement. The immunosuppressants involve many classes of drugs, including antibody therapies th at eliminate specific gr oups of cells or alter signaling pathways used by effector cells. The article reviews the agents and associated infections. b. Methods to reduce allograft and immune response prior to transplantation: potential clinical applications of donor and graft treatment. Transpl Int. 2006;19:351-9. Many studies have shown a strong association between initial graft injury and poor longterm graft outcome. Events initiated by unspecific immune- activating processes in cluding brain death and ischemia/reperfusion injury occurring prior to transplantation reduce gr aft functionality and amplify the host immune response. These events may be particularly relevant for less than optimal grafts with reduced resistance to unspecific inju ries. Several approaches to ameliorate immune activation of the graft by trea ting the donor or the graft have been studied. While various substances have been shown to have protective e ffects in experimental transplantation, only a few drugs have been tested clinically and have demons trated beneficial effects. We review the results of experimental and clinical studies on donor or graft immunomodul ation prior to transplantation and analyze the evidence tosupport clinical applica tion of these strategies. c. Methods to induce allograft host tolerance RESEARCH FRONTIER: Battaglia M Potential T regulatory cell therapy in transplant ation:how far have we come and how far can we go? Transpl Int. 2010;23:761-70 Graft survival has been lately improved by the introduction of efficient immunosuppressive drugs. However, late graft loss caused by chronic rejection and the side effects of long-term immunosuppression remain major obstacles for succe ssful transplantation. Operational tolerance, which is defined by the lack of acute and chroni c rejection and indefinite graft survival with normal graft function in the absence of continuous immunosuppressi on, represents an attractive alternative. Nevertheless, tolerance after alloge neic transplantation is commonly considered the 'mission impossible' for both immunologists and clinicians. One of the mechanisms involved in tolerance is the suppression of graft-specific a lloreactive T cells, which largely mediate graft rejection, by regulatory T cells (T regs) or by soluble f actors produced by Treg cells. With this review, I will make an effort to collect a nd describe the significan t studies performed in transplanted patients, and not in animal models or in in vitro sy stems, with the attempt to: (i) understand how tolerance is achieve d, (ii) define whether and how Tr eg cells influence transplant tolerance, (iii) describe the first clinical trials with Treg cells in humans (i.e. how far have we come) and (iv) predict the futureof Treg cell-ba sed therapy in humans (i .e. how far can we go).

Recently, new methods for expanding polyclonal and antigen-specific regul atory T cells have emerged.

GVHD: Acute and Chronic REVIEW GVHD: Ferrara JLM, Levine JE, 373: 1550-61 Haemopoietic-cell transplantati on (HCT) is an intensive therapy used to treat high-risk haematological malignant disorders and other life- threatening haematological and genetic diseases. The main complication of HCT is graftversus- host disease (GVHD), an immunological disorder that aff ects many organ systems, including the ga strointestinal tract, liv er, skin, and lungs. The number of patients with this complication continues to grow, and many return home from transplant centres after HCT requiring continued treatment with immunosuppressive drugs that increases their risks for serious in fections and other complications. In this Seminar, we review our understanding of the risk fact ors and causes of GHVD, the ce llular and cytokine networks implicated in its pathophysiology, and current strategies to prevent and treat the disease. We also summarise supportive-care measures that are essential for manageme nt of this medically fragile population. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Ford ML, Larsen CP Overcoming the memory barrier in tolerance induction: molecu lar mimicry and functional Curr Opin Organ Transpl 2010, 15:405-410 This review highlights recent advances in our understanding of the fr equency and nature of alloreactivity among memory T-cell populations, and discusses rece nt successes in experimentally targeting these populations in or der to prolong graft survival. Re cent findings Recent studies suggest that not only is alloreactivity present within peripheral T-cell compartments of normal healthy individuals, but cr oss-reactivity between viral-specific T cells and allotropes may in fact be a very common occurrence. Furthermore, this cro ssreactivity functions at the level of molecular mimicry of T-cell receptor recognition. Therapeutic s that specifically targ et cell surface molecules or effector pathways used by memory T cells to mediate graft rejection will likely be required in order to attenuate the donor-re active memory T-cell response during transplantation. A major challenge facing the field over the next decade is to define the heterogeneity that exists within memory T-cell populations that impacts graf t survival. Understanding the functional and phenotypic differences that modify the memory T- cell barrier to toleranc e induction might allow a strategy in which strength of i mmunosuppression could be tailored to fit the immunological history 314of a given transplant recipient in order to minim ize nonimmune toxicities, maximize protective immunity, and prolong graft survival.

Cancer. 2004;101:1936-46 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has e volved as a central treatment modality in the management of different hematologic malignancies. Despite adequate posttransplantation immunosuppressive therapy, acute graft-versus-hos t disease (GVHD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the hematopoietic st em cell transplantation setting, even in patients who receive human leukemic antigen (HLA) identical sibling grafts . Up to 30% of the recipients of stem cells or bone marrow transplantation from HLA-identical related donors and most patients who receive cells from other sources (matched-unrelated, non-HLA-identical siblings, cord blood) will develop > Grade 2 acute GVHD despite immunosuppressive prophylaxis. Thus, GVHD continues to be a major limitation to successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this review, the authors summarize th e most current knowledge on the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and ma nagement of this potentially life-threatening transplantation complication. REVIEW CHRONIC GVHD: disease is an important cause of late morbid ity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. With th e renewed interest in its pathophysiology and treatment, this review discusses recent clinical an d laboratory advances in this disease. Advances in pathophysiology, the relationship between chr onic graft-versus-host disease and relapse incidence, and recent developments in the prophylaxis, initial therapy, and therapy for refractory disease are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: A better understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic graft-versushost disease, including the potential role of a coordinated B-cell and T-cell response, is demonstrated. Cortic osteroids and cyclosporine or tacr olimus remain the standard as initial therapy. This combin ation is effective in the majority of affected patients, although therapy is often required for longer than 1 year. A lthough no strategy has been demonstrated to be effective in specifically preventing chronic graft-versus-host diseas e, several drugs have recently been demonstrated to be effective therapeutic agents for steroid-refractory disease. Agents such as mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, and rituximab have demonstrated response rates of greater than 60% in patients with st eroid-refractory disease. SU MMARY: Renewed interest and understanding of chronic graft-versus-host diseas e have led to novel treatment strategies for steroid-refractory disease. A focus on the in itial therapy and prophyl axis against chronic graftversus-host diseas e is now warranted. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Rieger K , Loddenkemper C, Maul J, et al Mucosal FOXP3+ regulatory T cells are numerica lly deficient in acute and chronic GvHD Blood 2006;103:2758-2763. 315CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (T regs) control immune responses to self- and foreign antigens and play a pivotal role in autoimmune diseas es, infectious and noninfectious inflammation, and graft rejection. Since recent experim ental studies have indicated that Tregs were able to ameliorate graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), we an alyzed the number of infiltrating Tregs in the intestinal mucosa as one site of GvH reactivity using immunoenzymatic labeling to enumerate FOXP3+ T cells in 95 intestinal biopsies from 49 allografted patients in comparison with healthy controls and patients with infectious inflamma tion. While patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV)- colitis or diverticulitis showed a concomitant increase of CD8+ effectors and Tregs, acute and chronic GvHD were characterized by the complete lack of a counter-re gulation indicated by a FOXP3+/CD8+ T-cell ratio identical to healthy controls. In contra st, specimens without histologic signs of GvHD demonstrated increased numbers of FOXP3+ per CD8+ T cells, indicating that the potential for Treg expansion is principally maintained in a llografted patients. Our findings provide evidence that GvHD is associated with an insufficient up-regulation of Tregs in intestinal GvHD lesions. The determination of FOXP3+/CD8+ ra tio can be a helpful tool to discriminate GvHD from infectious inflammation after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. LANDMARK ARTICLE: Martin PJ , Hansen JA, Buckner CD, et al. Effects of in vitro depletion of T cells in HLA-identical allogeneic marrow grafts Blood 1985;66:664-672 We report results of a pilot study designed to eval uate the effects of in vitro depletion of T lymphocytes from donor marrow in patients receiving HLA-identical marrow grafts for treatmentof hematologic malignancies. Twenty pa tients aged 31 to 50 years were prepared fortransplantation with cyclophosphamide (120 mg /kg) and fractionated total body irradiation (12.0or 15.75 Gy). All received cyclosporine after grafting. The donor marrows were treated with a mixture of eight murine monoclonal antibodies and rabbit serum complement in a manner that achieved a 2- to 3-log depletion of T cells in mo st patients. Initial engraftment occurred promptly in 19 of the patients, and only three had clinica lly significant acute graft-versus-host disease. Depletion of donor T cells, however, was associated with an increased incidence of graft failure, which occurred as late as 244 days after transpla ntation. Graft failure was transient in one patient but apparently was irreversible in seven others. Three of the seven patients had cytogenetic but not morphological evidence of leukemic relapse at the time of graft failure. All seven patients with irreversible graft failure have died, six after receiving second bone marrow transplants. Seven of the eight cases of graft failure occurred among th e 11 patients prepared for transplantation with 12.0 Gy of total-body irradiation, and only one occu rred among the nine patients with advanced malignancies who received 15.75 Gy of total-body irradiation. This association with irradiation dose suggests that host factors were partly responsi ble for the graft failures. Because graft failure seldom occurs in irradiated recipients of unm odified HLA identicalallogeneic marrow transplants, it appears that T cells in the donor marrow may serve a beneficial function in helping to maintain sustained engraftment possibly by eliminating host cells that can cause graft failure. Optimal application of in vitro manipul ation of donor marrow asa method fo r preventing graft-versus-host disease will require more effective immunosuppression of the recipient in order to assure sustained engraftment and function of donor stem cells. a.

Moreover, while the absen ce of acute GvHD (aGvHD) is associated with a higher risk of relapse of the underlying maligna nt disease, severe\\ aGvHD usually induces the occurrence of life-thre atening complications such as severe infections.

Immune modulation and chronic graft-versus-host disease. Bone Marrow Transpl 2008;42:S66-69 As more and more patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) survive the early post-transplant period, the number of individuals at risk for chronic GVHD has grown. Treatment for established cGVHD remains unsatisfactory. No experimental agent has demonstrated superiority to steroids alone in a randomized clin ical trial. Distinguishing chronic from acute graft- versus-host disease is a major issue. The impor tance of achieving clarity in cGVHD diagnosis is critical as efforts are undertaken to understand it s pathogenesis and to design definitive trials that can target prevention and/or tr eatment. Immune tolerance to self-antigens may be broken in cGVHD, giving rise to the autoimmune manifest ations of the disorder . Recent attention has focused on CD4+CD25 regulatory T cells and their relations hip to cGVHD. Significant enthusiasm has emerged for manipulating Treg eith er ex vivo or in vivo for clinical benefit. Another immunomodulatory approach to cGVHD might be the targeting of B lymphocytes and the antibodies they produce. As efforts continue to devise strategies to tr eat and prevent chronic GVHD, it is important to acknowledge the link between cGVHD and freedom from relapse, at least for certain malignancies. REVIEW Prevention ACUTE GVHD: Chao NJ, Chen BJ. Prophylaxis and Treatment of Disease Semin Hematol. 2006;44:32-41. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major obstacle to successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The ability to prevent GVHD--the application of successful prophylaxis--is crucia l as treatment when prophylaxis fails or remains suboptimal. A calcineurin inhibitor in combination with met hotrexate is still the mainstream regimen for prophylaxis of GVHD. Despite a steady increas e in the repertoire of available drugs, corticosteroids remain the first-line therapy fo r patients who fail prevention and develop GVHD. Pan T-cell depletion studies suggest that su ccess in prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD will depend on whether GVHD can be prevented without losing anti-malignancy and anti-infectious effects. Better understanding of the allogene ic response that is responsible for GVHD will facilitate the development of such an approach. REVIEW PREVENTION OF CHRONIC GVHD: 317Lee SJ. New approaches for preventing and treating chronic graft-versus -host disease. Blood 2005;105:4200-6 Despite improvements in the practice of alloge neic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) over years, ch ronic graft-versus-host diseas e (GVHD) remains a substantial problem with little change in the incidence, morbidity, and mortalit y of this complication. In fact, with increased use of periphera l blood, transplantation of olde r patients, and less immediate transplantation-related morta lity, the prevalence of chronic GVHD may increase. One of the difficulties in combating chronic GVHD is a lack of understanding about the pathophysiology of the syndrome. Inherent difficulties in conducting human clinical trials also contribute to the lack of meaningful progress. This review covers potential new approaches to the prevention andtreatment of chronic GVHD. b. Treatment REVIEW TREATMENT OF ACUTE GVHD: Paczesny S, Choi SW, Ferrara disease (GVHD) remains a ma jor cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), despite improvements in our understanding of its pathophysiology as well as the generation of new monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory chemotherapy, cellular therapeutics and suppor tive care. Herein, we review therapies that have proven effective as well as newer agents that have recently improved GVHD response rates and survival following HCT. Recent findings: Novel approaches to prevent or treat GVHD are often based on evidence from experimental models. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of GVHD may lead to the developmen t of innovative strategi es that target both soluble and cellular effectors. Am ong such agents are sirolimus, anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies, anti-LFA-3- IgG fusion protein, extracorporeal photophere sis, mesenchymal stem cells and regulatory T cells. Obstacles to the improveme nt of HCT include the tight linkage between GVHD toxicity and the beneficial graft-versus-leukemi a (GVL) effect, as well as the impairment of immune reconstitution by immunomodulatory drugs leading to life-threat ening infections. The design of newer phase I/II clini cal trials are underway. Future therapies are likely to include modulation of cell types that pl ay key roles in the GVH process, including regulatory T cells, dendritic cells, natural killer T cells and B cells. REVIEW TREATMENT OF CHRONIC GVHD: Jacobsohn D Optimal management of chronic graft-versus-host disease in J Haematol 2010;150:278-292 Summary: Chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD) after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantat ion (HSCT). Not only is it the ma jor cause of late mortality in HSCT patients, but it also accounts for significan t morbidity. Much of th e literature on chronic GVHD has focused on adults. Chronic GVHD is of ma jor importance in child ren, especially since they have years to live followi ng the complications of chronic GVHD and its therapy. The goal is to review incidence, manifestations, and therapies, especially when applicable to the paediatric population. 318 REVIEW Treatment of Acute GVHD: Bolanos-Meade J Update on the management of acute graft-versus-host disease. Curr Opin Oncol. 2006;18:120-5 Acute graft-versus-host of the commonest complicati ons after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Recent advances in its prevention and therapy are giving new hope to patients with this disease. This review covers the major advances in prophylaxis and therapy for this problem. RECENT FINDINGS: The use of nove l approaches for prophylaxis such as posttransplant cyclophosphamide and non-methotre xate-containing regimens is discussed. The results of therapy with new agents such as pentostatin, pulse cyclophos phamide, longwavelength ultraviolet A diftitox or etanercept are reviewed. SUMMARY: Without qu estion, outcome in patients who develop graftversus- host disease is improving. With better supportive care, and more eff ective prophylaxis and therapy, these patients have an improved chance for full recovery. Patients shoul d be enrolled, when possible, in studies aimed to prevent and treat graft-versus-host disease. REVIEW Treatment of Chronic GVHD: Bhushan V, Collins (HCT) is a treatment used increasingly for a variety of malignant and nonmalignant diseases of th e bone marrow and immune system.1 Although the procedure cures many patients with ot herwise incurable diseases, it is often associated with serious immunological complications, part icularly graft-vs-host diseas e (GVHD).2 A chronic form of GVHD afflicts many allogeneic HCT recipients, resulting in dysfuncti on of numerous organ systems and an oftentimes profound state of immunodeficiency.3-5 Chronic GVHD is the most frequent cause of poor long-term outcome and quality of life after allogeneic HCT. The syndrome typically develops several months after transplantation, when th e patient may no longer be under the direct care of the transplant team. The patient's primary physician plays an important role in diagnosis and treatment of th e patient with chronic GVHD. E. Immune System Related Malig nancies and Cellular Disorders 1. B cell and plasma cell neoplasms REVIEW: Jumaa H, Hendriks RW, 2005;23:415-45 The proliferation and differentia tion of lymphocytes are regulate d by receptors localized on the cell surface. Engagement of these receptors induc es the activation of intracellular signaling proteins that transmit the receptor signals to dist inct targets and control the cellular responses. The first signaling proteins to be discovered in higher organisms were the products of oncogenes. For example, the kinases Src and Abelson (Abl) were or iginally identified as oncogenes and were later characterized as important proteins for signal transduction in various cell types, including ymphocytes. Now, as many cellular signaling molecu les have been discovered and ordered into 319certain pathways, we can better und erstand why particular signaling proteins are asso ciated with tumorigenesis. In this review, we discuss recent progress in unraveling the molecular mechanisms of signaling pathways that contro l the proliferation and differentiation of early B cells. We point out the concepts of auto-inhibiti on and subcellular localization as crucial aspects in the regulation of B cell signaling. Jaglowski SM , Byrd JC is a class I chim eric anti-CD20 antibody that has shown efficacy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), both as a single agent and in combination with traditional chemotherapies. The modest activity demonstrat ed in early studies evaluating rituximab in relapsed CLL was improved with higher doses or more dose-intensive regimens that overcame the unfavorable pharmacokinetic featur es commonly found in CLL. These studies led to a variety of combination trials of rituximab with chemothera py, where both phase II and later phase III studies have shown great promise for the advancement of CLL therapy. Despite the therapeutic success of rituximab in CLL, studies demonstrating the definitive relative mechanism of tumor clearance are still lacking and this requires further investigation. In addition to being used as a therapy for CLL, rituximab is an effective treatment for autoimmu ne CLL complications such as hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Patients wi th CLL may experience early infusion-related side effects that can be diminished with cortic osteroid pretreatment and stepped-up dosing. Risk factors for may relate to atypical CLL expressing bright CD20 antigen expression, although several di fferent studies have not clearly im plicated elevated white blood cell count as a risk factor. Other adve rse events, including delayed cyt openias, reactivatio n of hepatitis B, and development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, are rare. Future efforts focusing on novel combination-based strategies will be required to fully ap preciate the benefit of this therapy in CLL. treatment: ca se series and comprehensive review of the literature. Medicine (Baltimore). 2010 Sep;89(5):308-18. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20 that is used mainly for the treatment of CD20-positive lymphoma. Recently, its use has been expanded to include treatment of other nonmalignant diseases such as rheumatologic diseases and autoimmune cytopenia. Correlating with the increased use of rituximab has been an increased number of reports of its late adverse effects. One of these is late-ons et neutropenia (LON). Most inves tigators define L ON as grade III- IV neutropenia occurring 3-4 week s after the last treatment with rituximab, in the absence of an alternative explanation for the ne utropenia.We report 6 cases of LO N identified in our institution. Four patients were treated for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and 2 patients for follicular lymphoma. Median patient age was 68 years (ra nge, 33-83 yr); LON appeared after a median interval of 77 days (range, 42-153 d) and lasted fo r a median of 5 days (range, 1-45 d). Five of the 6 patients presented with infectious complications , and 4 patients experienced recurrent episodes of neutropenia. One patient pres ented with LON and concomitant s ubacute pulmonary disease that was attributed to rituximab ther apy.In addition to our own case se ries we present a systematic review of the literature, which we performed to compile data to describe better the syndrome of 320LON. Systematic studies, case series, and case repor ts were extra cted. Most studies dealing with LON are retrospective by design and are limited by the heterogeneous popul ations included in the analysis. The incidence of LON is generally reported to be in the range of 3%-27%. Data regarding populations at risk are not consistent, and in some instances are conflicting.P atients considered at increased risk of LON include patients after auto logous stem cell transpla ntation, patients treated for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS )-related lymphoma, and patients treated with purine analogues. Patients who received previous cytotoxic treatment as well as those treated with more intensive chemotherapy or with chemothera py in combination with radiotherapy are also considered to be at risk of LON. In addition, advanced stages of disease and having received multiple doses of rituximab are risk factors for LON.The mechanism of LON is poorly understood. Direct toxicity is very unlikely. Some speculate that there may be an infectious etiology involved, as well as an antibody-mediated pr ocess, but these ideas have not been substantiated. The concept of a lymphocyte subpopulation imbalance leadin g to LON has been presented based on the demonstration of T-LGL in peripheral blood and bone marrow of patients with LON. Perturbations in stromal-derived factor-1 and in the BAFF cytokine have also b een discussed as potential players in the pathogenesis of LON. A recent study correlated specific polymorphism in the immunoglobulin G Fc receptor FC RIIIa 158 V/F with increased rates of LON.The clinical significance of LON is important be cause it may affect treatment strategies. Of note, infectious complications are not very frequent and not very severe. Pooling data from the major retrospective studies reveals an infection rate of 16.9%. Most infections were mild and resolved promptly. One death occurred from infection during neutropenia. Repeated ep isodes of LON are not uncommon, but it is so far impossible to iden tify those patients at risk of thes e relapsing episodes of LON. Re- treatment with rituximab after LON may result in r ecurrent episodes, but the implications and risks are uncertain at the present time. The role of gr owth factors once LON appears is ill defined, and the decision to use them should be made on a case-by-case basis. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Richardson PG ,Sonneveld P,Schuster MW, et Bortezomib Dexamethaso Multiple Myeloma N Engl J 2005;352:2487-2498 BACKGROUND: This study compared bortezomib with high-dose dexamethasone in patients With relapsed multiple myeloma who had received one to three previous therapies. METHODS: We randomly assigned 669 patients with relapsed myeloma to receive either an intravenous bolus of bortezomib (1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 for eight Three-week cycles, followed by treatment on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for three fiveweek cycles, or high-dose dexamethasone (40 mg orally) on da ys 1 through 4, 9 through 12, and 17 through 20 for four five-week cycles, followed by treatment on days 1 through 4 for five fourweek cycles. Patients who were assigned to receive dexamethasone were permitted to cross over to receive bortezomib in a companion study after diseas e progression. RESULTS: Patients treated with bortezomib had higher response rates, a longer time to progression (the primary end point), and a longer survival than patients treated with de xamethasone. The combined complete and partial response rates were 38 percent for bortezomib and 18 percent for dexamethasone (P<0.001), and the complete response rates were 6 percent and le ss than 1 percent, resp ectively (P<0.001). Median times to progression in the bortezomib and de xamethasone groups were 6.22 months (189 days) and 3.49 months (106 days), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.55; P<0.001). The one-year survival rate was 80 percent among patients taking bortezomib and 66 percent among patients taking 321dexamethasone (P=0.00 3), and the hazard ratio for overall survival with bortezomib was 0.57 (P=0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse ev ents were reported in 75 per cent of patients treated with bortezomib and in 60 percent of those treated with dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS: Bortezomib is superior to high-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have had a relapse after one to three previous therapies.

JAK2 is a cytoplasmi c whose ge ne is located on chromosome 9p24. It is involved in the regulation of different cytokines and grow th factors and plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (Smith et al., 2008). Translocations involving the JAK2 locus are uncommon with just a few cases described in the literature, and they usually lead to a fusion protein with JAK2 (P atnaik et al., 2010). Chromosome 9p24 abnormalities have been described in myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms chronic T-cell and myeloproliferative disorders (CMD) (Smith et al., 2008; L acronique et al., 1997). Although the breakpoints of each translocation are known, characterization of the partner gene has not been done in many of the cases reported due to insufficient sample or other factors. In the present study we review all transl ocations involving JAK2 that have been reported in the literature. REVIEW Rizvi MA. Evens AM. Tallman MS. Nelson BP. recognizes 9 distinct clinicopathologic peripheral T-cell NHLs. These disorders have unique characteristics and require individualized diagnostic and ther apeutic strategies. Tremendous progress has been made in recent years in the understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders. Specific chromosomal translocations and viral in fections are now known to be associated with certain lymphomas. In this review, we describe their clinical and pathol ogic features. We also discuss the use of molecular studies in the dia gnostic work-up of T-cell lymphomas. Because of the rarity of these disorders and the lack of well-designed clinical trials, the treatment of peripheral T-cell NHLs is often challenging. Additional studie s are required to learn more about the biology of these diseases, which may lead to more optimal and possibly targeted therapies. REVIEW: Willemze R, Jaffe ES, Burg G, classi fied by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classificat ion or the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, but both systems have shortcomings. In particular, differences in the classification of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas other than mycosis fungoides, diso rders and the different types of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas have resulted in considerable debate and confusion. During recent consensus meetings representative s of both systems reached agreement on a new classification, which is now calle d the WHO-EORTC classification. In this paper we describe the characteristic features of the different prim ary cutaneous lymphomas and other hematologic neoplasms frequently presenting in the skin, and discuss differences with the previous classification schemes. In addition, the relative frequency and survival data of 1905 patients with primary cutaneous lymphomas derived from Dutch and Austrian registries for primary cutaneous lymphomas are presented to illustrate the clinical significance of th is new classification. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Buttgereit P, Schakowski F, Marten A, et al. Effects of adenoviral wild-type p53 gene transfer in p53-mutated lymphoma cells. Cancer Gene Ther. 2001;8:430-439. The present study assessed the role of adenoviral vector-media ted wild-type p53 gene transfer in B lymphoma cells. Deficiency of p53-medi ated cell death is common in human cancer contributing to both tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Lymphoma cells are being considered as suitable targets for gene therapy protocol s. Recently, we reported an adenoviral protocol leading to highly efficient gene transfer to B lymphoma cells. All lymphoma cell lines (n=5) tested here showed mutations in the p53 gene locus. The aim of this work was to transduce lymphoma cells with the wild-type p53 gene. Us ing this protocol, 88% of Raji, 75% of Daudi, and 45% of OCI-Ly8-LAM53 cells were transfected with the reporter ge ne green fluorescent protein at a multiplicity of in fection of 200. The expression of green fluorescent protein in CA46 and BL41 cells was 27% and 42%, respectively. At this multiplicity of infection, growth characteristics of lymphoma cell lines were not cha nged significantly. In cont rast, cells transduced with wild-type p53 gene showed an inhibition of pr oliferation as well as an increase in apoptosis. Cell loss by apoptosis after p53 gene transfer was up to 40% as compared to transduction with an irrelevant vector. In addition, we determined the effects of DNA damage produced by the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor et oposide on cells. In Ad-p53- transfected Raji cells, treatment with the drug resulted in a marked in crease of cell loss in comparison to Ad-beta-Gal-transfected cells (45% vs. 77%). Interestingly, performing cytotoxicity studies, we could show an increased sensitivit y of Raji and Daudi cells against immunological effector cells. In conclusion, transduction of wild-type p53 into lymphoma cells expressing mutated p53 was efficient and led to inhibition of proliferation a nd increase in apoptotic rate in some cell lines dependent on p53 mutation. This pr otocol should have an impact on the use of lymphoma cells in cancer gene therapy protocols. LANDMARK ARTICLE: Detection and isolation of type C retrovirus particles from fresh and cultured lymphocytes of a cutaneous T-celllymphoma. 323Proc 1980;77:7415. Retrovirus morphology were found in two T-cell ly mphoblastoid cell lines, HUT 102 and CTCL-3, and in fresh peripheral blo od lym phocytes lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) . The cell lines continuously produce these viruses, which are collectively referred to as HTLV, strain CR(HTLVCR). Originally, the production of virus from HUT 102 cells required induction with 5-iodo-2 -deoxyuridine, but the cell line became a constitutive producer of virus at its 56th passage. Cell line CTCL-3 has been a constitutive producer of virus from its second passage in culture. Both mature and immature extracellular virus particles were seen in th in-section electron micrographs of fixed, pelleted cellular material; on occasion, typical type C budding virus particles were seen. No form of intracellular virus particle ha s been seen. Mature particles were 100-110 nm in diameter, consisted of an electron-dense core surr ounded by an outer membrane separated by an electronlucent region, banded at a density of 1.16 g/ml on a continuous 25-65% sucrose gradient, and contained 70S RNA and a DNA pol ymerase activity typical of vira l reverse transcriptase (RT; nucleotidyltransferase). showed cation preference Mg2+ over Mn2+, di stinct from the charac teristics of cellular DNA 317 polymerases purified from human lymphocytes and the RT from most type C viruses. Antibodies to cellular DNA polymerase and anti-bodies against RT pur ified from several animal retroviruses failed to detectably interact with HTLVCR RT under conditions that were positive for the respective homologous DNA polymerase, demons trating a lack of close relationship of HTLVCR RT to cellular DNA polymerases or RT of these viruses. Six major proteins, with sizes of approximately 10,000, 13,000, 19,000, 24,000, 42,000, and 52,000 daltons, were apparent when doubly banded, disrupted HTLVCR part icles were chromatographed on a NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel. The number of thes e particle-associated pr oteins is consistent with the expected proteins of a retrovirus, but th e sizes of some are distinct from those of most known retroviruses of the primate subgroups. 3.

Acute Monocytic Leukemia Does Not Have a Worse Prognosis Than Other Subtypes of AML: A Report From the East ern Cooperative Group J Clin Oncol 2004;22:1276 PURPOSE: Acute of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with characteristic biologic and clinical features. This study was designed to compare the outcome of patients with M5 to that of other subtypes of AML, and to iden tify differences in M5a and M5b. PATIENTS and METHODS: Methods: We reviewed a ll patients with AML M5 entered in three clinical trials for newly diagnosed AML c onducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group between 1989 and 1998. Eighty-one patients, 21 with M5a and 60 with M5b, were identified. RESULTS: The complete remission rate was 62% for all patients with M5; 52% for patients with M5a and 65% for patients with M5b (P = .3), and 60% for the 1,122 patients with non-M5 AML entered on the same clinical trials (P = .8 for M5 v non-M5). The 3-year disease-free and M5b (P = .31), and 33% for non-M5 patients (P = .13 for M5 v non-M5). The 3-year overall survival was 33% for M5a and M5b (P = .65), and 30% for non-M5 (P = .74 for M5 v non-M5). The karyotypes of patients with AML M5 were heterogeneous. CD11b was the only leukemic cell antigen expressed 324differently in M5a (53%) compared to M 5b (77%) significant =.02). CONCLUSI ON: AML similar to non-M5 AML with a prognosis that is not dependent on morphology. The disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with M5a, M5b, and non-M5 appear not to differ with currently available therapy. Biswas SK, Mantovani A. Macrophage plasticity and interaction with lymphocyte cancer as a paradigm. Nat Immunol. 2010 Oct;11(10):889-96. Plasticity is a hallmark of cells of the myelomono cytic lineage. In response to innate recognition or signals from lymphocyte subsets, mononuclear phagocytes undergo adaptive responses. Shaping of monocyte-macrophage function is an essential compone nt of resistance to pathogens, tissue damage and repair. The orchestra tion of myelomonocytic cell function is a key element that links inflammation and cancer and provides a paradigm for macrophage plasticity and function. A better understanding of the molecular ba sis of myelomonocytic cell plas ticity will open new vistas in immunopathology and therapeutic intervention.

Dasatinib versus imatinib in newly diagnos ed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia. N Engl J Med. 2010 Jun 17;362(24):2260-70. BACKGROUND: Treatment with dasatinib, a highly potent BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, has resulted in high rates of complete cytogenetic response and progression-free survival among patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase, after failure of imatinib treatment. We assessed the efficacy and safety of dasatinib, as compared with imatinib, for the first-line treatment of chronic-phase CML.MET HODS: In a multinational study, 519 patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML were randomly assigned to receive dasa tinib at a dose of 100 mg once daily (259 patients) or imatinib at a dose of 400 mg once da ily (260 patients). The primary end point was complete cytogene tic response by 12 months, confirmed on two consecutive assessments at least 28 days apart. Secondary end points, including major molecular response, were tested at a significance leve l of 0.0001 to adjust for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: After a minimum follow- up of 12 months, the rate of c onfirmed complete cytogenetic response was higher with dasatinib than with ima tinib (77% vs. 66%, P=0.007), as was the rate of complete cytogenetic response observed on at le ast one assessment (83% vs. 72%, P=0.001). The rate of major molecular response was higher with dasatinib than with imatinib (46% vs. 28%, P<0.0001), and responses were achieved in a shorter time with dasatinib (P<0.0001). Progression to the accelerated or blastic phase of CML occurr ed in 5 patients who were receiving dasatinib (1.9%) and in 9 patients who were receiving ima tinib (3.5%). The safety profiles of the two treatments were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatini b, administered once dail y, as compared with imatinib, administered once daily, induced signif icantly higher and faster rates of complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response. Since achi eving complete cytogenetic response within 12 months has been associated w ith better long-term, progression-free survival, dasatinib may improve the long-term outcomes among patients with newly diagnosed chronic- phase CML.

While chemotherapy inducing rem ission of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the disease has a high probability of relapse. Strategies to preven t relapse involve consolidation chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation and imm unotherapy. Evidence for immunosurveillance of AML and susceptibility of leukaemia cells to bo th T cell and natural killer (NK) cell attack and justifies the application of imm une strategies to control residu al AML persisting after remission induction. Immune therapy for AML includes all ogeneic stem cell transplantation, adoptive transfer of allogeneic or autol ogous T cells or NK cells, vaccinati on with leukaemia cells, dendritic cells, cell lysates, peptides and DNA vaccines and treatment with cytokines, antibodies and immunomodulatory agents.

IL-17/Th17 in the tumour microenvironment. Oncogene. 2010 Oct 21;29(42):5653-62. The role of interleukin (IL)-17 and the IL-17- producing T helper (Th)17 cells in cancer has recently become the focus of extensive investig ation. An expanding body of literature implicates Th17 cells and their hallmark cytokine in both pro- and anti-tumourigenic processes. In this review we describe their biological ac tivities and outline the reciprocal interactions be tween Th17 cells and other cells of the immune syst em. We also discuss the evidence re garding their dual role in the tumour microenvironment. An understanding of the pr ocesses that regulate the pro- or anti-tumour activities of Th17 cell and IL-17 will allow the development of more effective means for cancer immunotherapy. 4. Mast Cell Dyscrasias REVIEW ARTICLES Noack F. Sotlar K. Notter M. Th iel E. Valent P. Horny HP. Aleukemic mast cell leukemia with and a heteroge neous group of disorders characterized by proliferation and accumulation of mast cells in 1 or more orga n systems. Mast cell leukemia (MCL) is an extremely rare subtype of mastocytosis in which a le ukemic spread of mast cells and a rapid progression of disease is seen. In typical ca ses, mast cells are foun d in the peripheral blood. However, an aleukemic variant of MCL (formerly termed malignant mastocytosis) has also been described. We here report a case of aleuke mic MCL with abnormal immunophenotype of mast cells and the classical c-kit point mutation Asp- 816-Val (=D816V). The 75-year-old male patient had a short history of weight loss and lymphadenopathy. There were no urticaria pigmentosa-like skin lesions. The bone marrow was diffusely infilt rated with atypical mast cells that comprised more than 80% of all nu cleated cells on a bone marrow smears. As assessed by neoplastic mast cells expressed CD2, CD25, CD68, and the KIT protein (CD117). Mutation analysis reveal ed the c-kit mutation D816V. Since circulating mast cells could not be detected in the peri pheral blood, the diagnosis of aleukemic MCL was established in accordance to the updated WHO cons ensus classification. This case further supports the notion that the pathogenesis (c-kit mutation D816V) in MCL is closely related to that found in indolent mast cell disorders. Ho wever, additional (but yet unknown) molecula r (genetic) defects have to be considered to explai n the extremely heterogenous clini cal course in these patients. Alvarez-Twose I.

Journal of Allergy & Clinical Immunology. 125(6):1269-1278.e2, 2010 Jun ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Systemic mast cell activation disorders (MCADs) are characterized by severe and systemic mast cell (MC) mediators-related symptoms frequently associated with increased serum baseline tryptas e (sBt). OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical, biological, and molecular characteristics of adult patients presenti ng with systemic MC activation symptoms/anaphylaxis in the absence of skin mastocytosis who showed clonal (c) versus nonclonal (nc) MCs and to provide indication criteria for bone marrow (BM) studies. METHODS: Eighty-three patients were studied. Patients show ing clonal BM MCs were grouped into indolent systemic mastocytosis without skin lesions (I SMs(-); n = 48) and othe r c-MCADs (n = 3)-both with CD25(++) BM MCs and either positive mast/s tem cell growth factor receptor gene (KIT) mutation or clonal human the absence of KIT mutation; n = 32) and compared for their clinical, biological, and molecular charact eristics. RESULTS: Most clonal patients (48/51; 94%) met the World Health Organization criteria for systemic mastocytosis and were classified as ISMs(-), whereas the other 3 c-MCAD and all nc-MCAD patients did not. In addition, although both patients with ISMs(-) and patients with nc-MCAD presented with idiopath ic and allergen-induced anaphylaxis, the former showed a higher frequenc y of men, cardiovascular symptoms, and insect bite as a trigger, together with greater sBt. Based on a multivariate analysis, a highly efficient model to predict clonality before BM sampling was built that includes male sex (P = .01), presyncopal and/or syncopal episode s (P = .009) in the absence of urticaria and angioedema (P = .003), and sBt >25 microg/L (P = .006) as independent predictive factors. CONCLUSIONS: 327Patients with c-MCAD and ISMs(-) di splay unique clinical and labor atory features different from nc-MCAD patients. A significant percentage of c-MCAD patients can be considered as true ISMs(-) diagnosed at early phases of the disease. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Pardanani A. Tefferi A.

The BH3-mimetic ABT-737 induces mast cell apop tosis in vitro and in vivo: potential for therapeutics Journal of Immunology. 185(4):2555-62, 2010 Aug 15 . ABSTRACT: Mast cells and their mediators are implicated in the pathogenesis of many different diseases. One possible therapeutic intervention in mast cell-associated diseases can be to reduce the number of tissue mast cells by inducing mast ce ll apoptosis. In this stu dy, we demonstrate that mast cells exhibit a high sensitivity to AB T-737, a BH3-only mimetic mo lecule that induces apoptosis the prosurvi val proteins, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w. Primary mast cells as well as mast cell lines te sted succumbed to apoptosis in response to the inhibitor at varying but seem ingly low concentrations compared with other leukocytes investigated. I.p. injections of ABT-737 in mice resulted in a total abolishment of mast cells in the peritoneum. Confocal microscopy an alysis of peritoneal cells reve of mast cells being phagocytosed by macr ophages. In addition, ex vivo treatment of human skin biopsies with ABT-737 demonstrated increased mast cell a poptosis. The data we present in this article show exceptional mast cell sensitivity to ABT-737, a selective inhibitor of antiapoptotic proteins, rendering a possible application for BH3-only mimetic compounds like ABT-737 in mast cell- associated diseases, such as mastocytosis , allergy, asthma, and other chronic inflammations. REVIEW: Akin C. Metcalfe DD. Systemic mastocytosis Annu Rev Med. 2004;55:419-32 Systemic mastocytosis is a clonal disorder of th e mast cell and its progen itor. The symptoms of systemic mastocytosis are due to the pathologic accumulation a nd activation of mast cells in various tissues such as bone marro w, skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and spleen. Recent studies revealed striking differences between the molecula r and cellular biology of mast cells in patients with mastocytosis and those of healthy individuals. These findings are being used in formulating diagnostic criteria as well as designing nove l treatment approaches to the disease. REVIEW: Brockow Urticaria pigmentosa (UP), resulting from the accumulation of excessive numbers of mast cells in the skin, is the most common form of cutaneous mastocytosis. Obse rvations highlight the diversity of this disease. Clonal expansion of early hematopoietic progenitor cells carrying 328activating mutations in KIT seems t o be the ba sis of adult-onset UP. New pathogenetic findings are leading to the development of new diagnostic surrogate mark ers of disease and therapeutic approaches targeting neoplastic mast cells.

Tryptase levels as an indicator of mast- cell activation in systemic anaphylaxis and mastocytosis N Engl J Med 1987 316:1622-1626 Better methods are needed to asse ss mast-cell activation in vivo a nd to distinguish the activation Better methods are needed to asse ss mast-cell activation in vivo and to distinguish the activation of mast cells from that of basophils. Tryptase, a neutral protease selectively concentrated in the secretory granules of human mast cells (but not basophils), is rele ased by mast cells together with histamine and serves as a marker of mast- cell activation. In 17 patients with systemic mastocytosis, concentrations of tryptase in plasma were linearly related to those of histamine (P less than 0.01). Eleven of the 17 patients had tryptase levels of 4 to 88 ng per milliliter, indicating ongoing mast-cell activation. In each of six patients who experi enced corresponding anaphylactic reactions after penicillin, aspiri n, or melon ingestion, a wasp s ting, exercise, or antilymphocyte globulin injection, tryptase levels in serum ranged from 9 to 75 ng per milliliter, indicating mast- cell activation during each of these events. In cont rast, serum tryptase levels were less than 5 ng per milliliter in all patients presenting with m yocardial disease (n = 8, 6 with hypotension) or sepsis (n = 6, 3 with hypotension) and in the co ntrols (n = 20). One patient had a myocardial infarction after anaphylaxis in response to a wasp sting and an elevated tr yptase level of 25 ng per milliliter. Thus, the plasma or serum tryptase level is a diagnostic correlate of mast cell related events. IMAGES IN CLINICAL MEDICINE: Systemic Mastocytosis Deb A., Tefferi A. N Engl J and Wardlaw A.

A review of treatment with mepolizumab, an an ti-IL-5 mAb, in hypereosinophilic syndromes and asthma Journal of Allergy Immunology. 125(4):803-13, 2010 Apr . ABSTRACT: The hypereosinophilic syndromes (H ESs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by peripheral blood eosinophilia with end-organ damage and varying in severity 330from nonspecific symp toms to life-threatening. Tr eatment objectives are a safe reduction of blood and tissue eosinophil levels and prevention of eosinophil-mediated tissue damage. Current treatment of patients with HESs, who lack the FIP- 1-like 1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRA) fusion gene, is mainly systemic corticosteroid therapy. Eosinophil development from hematopoietic progenitor ce lls is regulated by IL-5, which influences maturation, differentiation, mobiliza tion, activation, and survival. Cons equently, inhibiting IL-5 is a logical therapeutic objective for patients with HESs or selected patients with asthma. Mepolizumab is a fully humanized anti-IL-5 mono clonal IgG(1) antibody that binds to free IL-5 with high affinity and specificity to prevent IL-5 from associating with the IL-5 receptor complex alpha-chain on the surface of eosino phils. In clinical trials with patients with HESs, mepolizumab reduced blood eosinophil counts and the maintenan ce corticosteroid dose and had no major safety concerns. Mepolizumab reduced airway and blood eosinophils and prevented asthma exacerbations. Thus, mepolizumab may be effectiv e for long-term treatment of patients with selected eosinophilic disorders.

Although most patients have a response to corticosteroids, side effects are common and can lead to considerable morbidity. METHODS: We conducted an international, ra ndomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of an anti -interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody, mepolizumab, in patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome. Pa tients were negative for the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene and required prednis one monotherapy, 20 to 60 mg pe r day, to maintain a stable clinical status and a blood eosinophil count of less than 1000 per microliter. Patients received either intravenous mepolizumab or placebo while the prednisone dose was tapered. The primary end point was the reduction of the prednisone do se to 10 mg or less per day for 8 or more consecutive weeks. RESULTS: The primary end poi nt was reached in 84% of patients in the mepolizumab group, as compared with 43% of pa tients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59 to 5.26; P<0.001) with no increase in clinical activity of the hypereosinophilic syndrome. A blood eosinophil count of less than 600 per microliter for 8 or more consecutive weeks was achieved in 95% of patients receiving mepolizumab, as compared with 45% of patients receiving placebo (haza rd ratio, 3.53; 95% CI, 1.94 to 6.45; P<0.001). adverse events occurred in seven patien ts receiving mepolizumab (14 events, including one death; mean [+/-SD] durati on of exposure, 6.7+/-1.9 months) a nd in five patients receiving placebo (7 events; mean duration of exposure, 4.3+/-2.6 months).

Recent studies clearly indi cate that many patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of this syndrome can now be classified as presenti ng one of two major di sease variants: the myeloproliferative or the lymphocytic variant. Research in cellular and molecular biology has provided .rm evidence for the existence of disc rete hematological disorders underlying these variants, questioning the pertin ence of continued reference to idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome in such patients. Furthermore, identica tion of these variants has a number of prognostic and therapeutic implications thatmust be taken into consideration for ad equate management of these patients.

Although corticosteroids are the first-line therapy for many of these disorders, approaches to the treatment of patients who do not tolerate or are unresponsive to corticosteroids are poorly standardized. A multid isciplinary group of 37 clinicians and scientists participated in a workshop held in May 2005 in Bern, Switzerland to discuss current and future approaches to therapy for 3 eosinophilmediated disorders: hypereosinophilic syndrome, Churg- Strauss syndrome, and eosinophil-associated gastro intestinal disease. Th e goal of the workshop was to summarize available data regarding treatm ent of these disorders to identify the most promising therapies and approaches for furt her study. There was consensus among all of the participants that the id entification of markers of disease pr ogression to assess treatment responses is a research priority for all 3 disorders. Furtherm ore, the need for newer therapeutic strategies and novel drugs, as well as multicenter trials to a ssess all treatment modalities, was emphasized. LANDMARK PAPER: Cools J. DeAngelo DJ.

A tyrosine kinase created by fusion of th e PDGFRA and FIP1L1 genes as a therapeutic target of syndrome ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Idiopa e a prolonged state of eosinophilia associated with organ dysfunctio n. It is of unknown cause. Recent reports of responses to imatinib in patients with the syndrome suggested that an activated kinase such as ABL, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), or KIT, all of which are inhibited by imatinib, might be the cause. METHODS: We treated 11 patients w ith the hypereosinophilic syndrome with imatinib and identified the molecu lar basis for the response. RESULTS: Nine of the 11 patients treated with imatinib had responses lasting more than three months in which the 332eosinophil count returned to normal. One such patien t had a complex chromosomal abnormality, leading to the identification of a fusion of the Fip1-like 1 (FIP 1L1) gene to the PDGFRalpha (PDGFRA) gene generated by an interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12. FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha is a constitutively activated tyrosi ne kinase that transforms hemat opoietic cells and is inhibited by imatinib (50 percent inhibitory concentrati on, 3.2 nM). The FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene was subsequently detected in 9 of 16 patients with the syndrome and in 5 of the 9 patients with responses to imatinib that lasted more than three months. Relapse in one patie nt correlated with the appearance of a T674I mutation in PDGFRA that confer s resistance to ima tinib. CONCLUSIONS: The hypereosinophilic syndrome may result from a novel fusion tyrosine kinase - FIP1L1- PDGFRalpha - that is a consequence of an inte rstitial chromosomal deletion. The acquisition of a T674I resistance mutation at the time of relapse demonstrates that FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha is the target of imatinib. Our data indicate that the deletion of genetic material may result in gain-of- function fusion proteins. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Kim YJ, Prussin C, Martin B, et al Rebound eosinophilia after treatment of hy pereosinophilic syndrome and characterized by sustained eosinophilia and eosi nophil-mediated tissue damage. Although treatment with the humanized monoc lonal anti-IL-5 antibody SCH55700 resulted in improvement of eosinophilia and clinical symptoms in 6 of 8 of patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome or eosinophilic gastroenteritis with peripheral eosinophilia for as long as 12 weeks, eosinophil counts subsequently rose above baseline levels, accompanied by an exacerbation of symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To identify the m echanism underlying this rebound eosinophilia. METHODS: Purified eosinophils from patient s or normal donors were cultured with IL-5, patient serum, and/or anticytokine antibodies, and eosinophil survival was assessed by flow cytometry. Serum and intracellular cytokine levels were measured by multiplex sandwich ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: Before treatment with SCH55700, in vitro eosinophil survival in media and in response to recombinant IL-5 was similar in patients and normal donors. At 1 month posttreatment, the eosinoph il survival curves were unchanged in 4 of 5 patients in media and in all 5 patients in re sponse to recombinant IL-5. Normal eosinophil survival was prolonged .01). This posttreatment serum effect on eosinophil survival was reversed by th e addition of the monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibody TRFK5. Although increased levels of serum IL-5 were observed at 1 month compared with 2 to 3 days posttreatment in 5 of 6 patients ( P = .04), intracellular cytokine analysis did not reveal increased production of IL-5 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells . CONCLUSIONS: The rebound eosinophilia after SCH55700 treatment is a result of a serum factor that enhances eosinophil survival. Reversal of this effect by the addition of antibody to IL -5 suggests that this factor may be IL-5 itself. LANDMARK ARTICLE: Schrezenmeier H,Thome SD, Tewald F, et al. Interleukin-5 is the predominant eosinophilopo ietin produced by phe notype established from peripheral blood of a patient with idiopathic hypere osinophilic syndrome (HES) were found to release a lineagespecific eosinophilic colony-stimulating factor (Eo-C SF). The present study was undertaken to identify the lymphokine accounting for this Eo -CSF activity. Comparison of TLC-derived Eo- CSF with recombinant interleukin-5 (rhI L-5), recombinant human granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) and recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL- 3) by in vitro clonogenic assays revealed similar bioactivity of HES-de rived Eo-CSF against IL-5, GM-CSF and IL-3 confirmed that IL-5 mainly accounts for the Eo-CSF activity in all 9 HES-derived TLC tested. Eosinophilic colony (CFU-Eo) formation supported by condi tioned media of the TLC was significantly inhibited in all clones by addition of anti-IL -5 monoclonal antibody (MAB) to the conditioned anti-IL-5 MAB was specific a nd dose-dependent. In 2 of the 9 clones, anti- GM-CSF antibodies could partially neutralize the Eo-CSF activity in the conditioned media. In 4 clones, addition of a combination of anti-IL -5 MAB and anti-GM-CSF antiserum to the conditioned media reduced CFU-Eo formation si gnificantly more than addition of anti-IL-5 MAB alone. In none of the TLC could a signifi cant role for IL-3 in eosinophilic colony formation be shown. These results were confirmed at the mRNA level. Cytokine transcripts were detected by reverse transcription (RT) and s ubsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Under the same experimental conditions, all HES-derived TLC, but only one third of tested TLC from healthy donors, expressed IL-5 mRNA 5 days afte r stimulation. In control TLC with inducible IL-5 mRNA expression, IL-5 transcripts were found for only 3 days after stimulation. In contrast, HES-derived TLC contained IL-5 mRNA at least until day 18 after restimulation. All HES clones expressed GM-CSF mRNA upon stimula HES-derived TLC IL-3 mRNA even after stimulation. Wher eas IL-5 was expressed abundantly in all HESclones, the intensity of PCR products for GM -CSF and IL-3 showed striking differences. Our in vitro results suggest that IL-5 produced by activated CD4+ T lymphocytes plays a crucial role in the induction of eosinophilia in HES. In addition, GM-CSF but not IL-3 seems to contribute partially to the increased eosinophil production in HES. 6. Cryopathies and Amyloid REVIEW: Grateau G. Duruoz MT. Autoinflammatory conditions; When to suspect? How to treat? Best Practice & Research in Clinical Rheumatology. 24(3):401-11, 2010 Jun. ABSTRACT: The term 'autoinflammatory disease' encompasses an enlarging group of inflammatory disorders defined as Mendelian genetic diseases of the innate immune system. This group is growing considering the fact that diseases sharing strong sim ilarities with this core group can be defined as autoinflammatory. The core group consists now of six disorders also known as hereditary recurrent fever syndromes. The most common is familial Mediterranean fever, an autosomal recessive disease affecting mainly popul ations of Mediterranea n ancestry. All these six diseases are characterised by inflam matory attacks both at the clinical and at the biological level. The diagnosis of each of these diseases relies first on clinical features and second on genetic testing, which is guided by the cl inical results. Deciphering the role of interleukin-1 in the regulation of the inflammatory response through th e inflammasome represents a major advance in 334the knowledge of the mechanism s of these diseases with, as a main consequence, treatment with interleukin-1 inhibitors.

ABSTRACT: Primary (AL) amyloidosis is the most prevalent type of systemic amyloidosis, and management of this disease has evolved through the years from supportive care to aggressive treatments that include immunomodulatory agents and high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, other types of amyloi dosis are increasingly recognized, such as familial amyloidosis and senile cardiac amyloidosis, and management of these conditions is different from that of AL amyloi dosis. Congo red staining with exhibition of an apple-green birefringe nce is diagnostic of amyloid . Immunohistochemistry can detect amyloid deposits but has limitations, and newer molecular techniques such as mass spectrometry show promise in determining types of amyloidosis. Physicians need to be aware of clinical scenarios that can mimic AL amyloidosis to avoid mi sdiagnosis and harm to the patient. Pettersson T. Konttinen YT. Amyloidosis-recent developments. Seminars in Arthritis & Rheumatism. 39(5):356-68, 2010 Apr ABSTRACT OBJECTIVES: To describe the clin ical presentation, diag nosis, classification, grading, evaluation of prognosis, and treatment of amyloidosis against the background of its pathomechanisms. METHODS: PubMed and MEDLINE databases (1990 to October 2007) and internet were searched for the key word amyloidos is and evaluated on the ba sis of the authors' own clinical experience and work on the topic. RESULTS: A clinical suspicion of amyloidosis arises when a patient with a chronic inflammatory disease, plasma cell dyscrasia, or a family history of hereditary amyloidosis develops \"an amyloid syndrome\" or more rare but specific signs. Microscopy of Congo red stained tissue specime ns under polarized light shows birefringent amyloid, which is typed by iden tification of the amyloid prec ursor by immunohistochemistry, amino acid sequencing, or proteomics. The di agnosis can be supported by genetic tests. Amyloidosis now covers biochemical ly and clinically 27 distinct types in man and 9 in animals. Grading to mild, moderate, and severe diseas e based on laboratory tests and radiology is introduced. Prognosis is affected by the rate of synthesis and the c oncentration of the circulating precursor. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying dis ease is mandatory as the treatment is based on disease control and inhibition of amyloid precursor production. Organ-specific treatment, such as transplantation, hemodialysis, trea tment of heart failure, pacemakers, and substitution to prevent nutritional deficiencies, is often needed. CONC LUSIONS: As our knowledge of the pathogenesis of amyloidosis and the structure- function relationship of amyloid proteins increases, new therapies will be developed to prevent protein misfolding and aggregation, inhibit fibrillogenesis, and enhance clearance of amyloid.

Immunotherapy directed against the beta-amyloid peptide may be capable of slowing the rate of disease progression. Bapineuzumab, an anti-beta-amylo id monoclonal antibody, will be the first such agent to emerge from Phase III clinical tria ls. AREAS COVERED IN THIS review The primary literature on bapineuzumab from 2009 and 2010 is reviewed in its en tirety, along with the literature on AN1792, a first-generation anti-bet a-amyloid vaccine, from 2003 to 2009. Other Alzheimer's immunotherapeutics cu rrently in development, according to www.clinicaltrials.gov , are also discussed. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: In addition to a critical appraisal of the Phase II trial results for bapineuzumab, th is review considers the broader field of immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease as a whole, including the challenges ahead. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Bapineuzumab appears capable of reducing the cerebral beta-amyloid peptide burden in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, particularly in APOE 4 carriers, its ability to slow disease progression remains uncertai n, and vasogenic edema - a dose-limiting and potentially severe adverse reaction - may limit its clinical applicability Kastritis E.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Ninety-four patients from three centers were analyzed: 19% received the combination as first-line treatment , 81% had a median of two previous therapies, a nd 69% had refractory diseas e, while most patients had involvement or elevated serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Results A hematologic response wa s achieved in 71% within a median of 52 days, including 25% complete responses (CRs). Previously untreated patients had a 47% CR rate. Age 65 years or younger (P = .043) and twice weekly administration of bortezomib (P = .041) were associated with higher response rates. A cardiac response was documented in 29% of patients, in most as sustained improvement of functional clas s and less often as a decrease in wall thickness. Hematologic responses were associated with a cardiac response and NT-proBNP reduction. After a median follow-up of 12 months, 29% of patients had organ progression a nd 27% had hematologic progression. Median survival has not been reached and the 1-year survival rate is 76%. Baseline NT-proBNP was independently asso ciated with survival (P = .001) , while in a landmark analysis, survival was associated with NT-proBNP reduction of > or = 30% (P = .006) and achievement of hematologic response (P = .001). Toxicity was ma nageable and mostly consisted of neuropathy, orthostasis, peripheral edema, and constipati on or diarrhea. CONCLUSION Bortezomib with or without dexamethasone is active in AL amyloidosis and induces rapid responses and high rates of hematologic and organ responses. Serial meas urement of cardiac biomarkers is a powerful predictor vessels. A causative role of hepa titis C virus in over 80% patients has been definitively established, with heterogeneous ge ographical distribution. This review focuses on recent etiopathogenetic, clinico-diagnostic, and therapeutic studies. REVIEW: Med 2006; is clinical disorder caused by depositi on of insoluble abnormal fibrils, derived from aggregation of misfolded, normally soluble, protein. About 23 different unrelated proteins are known to form am yloid fibrils in vivo, which share a pathognomonic structure although they are associated with clinically distinct conditions. Systemic amyloidosis, with amyloid deposits in the viscera, blood vessel walls, and connective tissue, is usually fatal and is the cause of about one per thousand deaths in deve loped countries. This ra rity and the variable involvement of different organs and tissues are often responsible for missed or delayed diagnosis, and amyloidosis remains a considerable clinical challenge. However, recent elucidation of important aspects of pathogenesis, as well as developments in diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment, have greatly improved outcomes, esp ecially when patients are managed in specialist centers.

J Hepatol. 2005;42:632-8 BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study is to verify the efficacy and safety of peginterferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin for initial treatment of HCV-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia. METHODS: Eighteen patients (7 women and 11 men) affected by mixed cryoglobulinemia were included in the study and tr eated with peg-interfer on alfa-2b 1.0 microg/kg once a week plus ribavirin ( 1000 mg daily) for 48 weeks, rega rdless of the HCV genotype. RESULTS: At the end of the treatment HCV-RNA became undetectable in 15 patients (83%) and most patients improved clinically. One subjec t suspended treatment at 13th week due to depression. A large fraction of the patients (8 cases: 44%) relapsed both virologically and clinically a few weeks af ter the end of therapy. At the end of follow-up, only eight patients (44%) obtained a sustained virological response. CONCLUSIONS: Peg-interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin seems safe and useful for patien ts affected by mixed cryog lobulinemia, but not as effective as in patients with HCV-positive chronic hepatitis without hepatitis B virus and essential mixed cryoglobulinemia N Engl J Med 1977;296:1501-1504 In view of a high frequency of liver invol vement in patients with essential mixed cryoglubulinemia, we looked for evidence for hepati tis B virus infection in 25 serum specimens and 19 cryoprecipitates obtained from 30 patients. Three of the 25 serum specimens contained 337Hbs Ag, and 12 had antibody. The frequency of positive results was increased to s ix and 11 of 19 respectively when cryoprecipitates were exam ined, and 14 of 19 (74 per cent) of the cryoprecipitates were positive for either HBs Ag or its antibody. Electron microscopy of four cryoprecipitates showed structures resembling the 20-nm and 27-nm spheres, tubules, as well as the Dane particles characteristic of hepatitis B vi rus infection. Since such infection appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of the syndrome, the term \"essential mixed cryoglobulinemia\" should be replaced by \"mixed cryoglobulinemia sec ondary to hepatitis B virus\" or perhaps to other viral infections. 7. Clinical skills: Physical findings associ ated with neoplasms, interpretation Saavedra-Lauzon AP. Toxic exanthems in the adult population American Journal of Medicine. 123(4):296-303, 2010 Apr . ABSTRACT: Frequently the inte rnist is confronted with the nonspecific exanthematous eruption. While often a sign of a benign and self-limiting pr ocess, an exanthem also might herald the development of a more severe systemic syndrome. Infections, immune-mediated processes, drug reactions, a neoplasm, and familial syndromes with poor prognoses might all manifest initially with an exanthem. A thorough history and comple te physical examination should be performed on all patients who present with an exanthem. Characterization of the exanthem morphology, other physical examination findings, and review of system s can help guide laborato ry testing and ensure prompt diagnosis and early treatment of potenti ally life-threatening c onditions. This article provides a brief overview of the conditions that mu st be considered in the evaluation of an ill patient with an exanthem. Salzman BE. Lamb K. Olszewski RF. Tully A. Studdiford J. Diagnosing cancer in the symptomatic patient Primary Care; Clinics in Office Practice. 36(4):651-70; 2009 Dec ABSTRACT: Finding cancer at its earliest, most treatable stage gives patients the greatest chance of survival. For a number of cancer s, screening tests allow for early detection and treatment, and thereby, reduce cancer-related mortality. Howeve r, many cancers are discovered by symptomatic presentation rather than screen ing. This article addresses several symptoms commonly reported in the primary care setting, includ ing rectal bleeding, a breast lump, cough, lymphadenopathy, and weight loss, and offers an evidence-based appro ach to the consideration and possibly the diagnosis of cancer. REVIEW (Paraneoplastic findings): Thomas I. Schwartz RA. Dermatol. 2005;23:593-600, 2005 Paraneoplastic syndromes are a group of clinical manifestations associated with a malignancy, but not directly related to the primary tumor itself or to its metastases. Characteristically, they follow a course parallel to the tumor, resolve with succes sful treatment of the primary tumor, and tend to recur with its relapse or the onset of metastases . The mechanism by which they occur is not well understood, but may be related to th e production of bioactive substances by or in response to the 338tumor, such as polypeptide horm ones, hormone-lik e peptides, antibodies or immune complexes, cytokines, or growth factors.

REVIEW (SPEP): O'Connell TX, Horita, TJ. Kasravi B Fam Physician 2005;71:105-12 . Serum protein electrophoresis is used to identify patients with multiple myeloma and other serum protein disorders. Electrophoresis separates proteins based on their physical properties, and the subsets of these proteins are used in interpre ting the results. Plasma protein levels display reasonably predictable changes in response to acute inflammation, malignancy, trauma, necrosis, infarction, burns, and chemical injury. A homogene ous spike-like peak in a focal region of the gamma-globulin zone indicates a monoclonal gammopathy. Monoclonal gammopathies are associated with a clonal process that is mali gnant or potentially malignant, including multiple myeloma, Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia, solitary plasmacytoma, smoldering multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, plasma cell leukemia, heavy chain disease, and amyloidosis. The quantity of M protein, the results of bone marrow biopsy, and other characteristics can help differentiat e multiple myeloma from the other causes of monoclonal gammopathy.

As a group, antibody deficiencies represent th e most common types of primary immune deficiencies in human subjects. Often symptoms do not appear until the latter part of the first year of life, as passively acquired IgG from the mother decreases to below protective levels. As with the T-cell immune deficiencies, the spectrum of an tibody deficiencies is br oad, ranging from the most severe type of antibody deficiency with totally absent B cells and serum Igs to patients who have a 339selective antibody deficiency with normal serum I g. In addition to the increased susceptibility to infections, a numb er of other disease processes (eg, autoimmun ity and malignancies) can be involved in the clinical presenta tion. Fortunately, the availability of intravenous immune serum globulin has made the management of these patients more complete. Recently, molecular immunology has led to iden tification of the gene or genes involved in many of these antibody deficiencies. As discussed in this review, this has led to a better elucidation of the B-cell development and differentiation pathways and a more complete understanding of the pathogenesis of many of these antibody deficiencies. REVIEW (lymphocyte subsets): Backteman K.

Three- colour-flow cytometry was used to investigate the biological and methodological variation of lymphocyte populations in blood. Fifteen healthy individuals (11 females and 4 male s) were longitudinally monitore d for 2-8 years. Blood samples were drawn monthly when possible. In total, 493 observations were included. Absolute counts and proportions were determined for T-cells (CD3(+)), variation over the year, ANOVA testing showed only a minor m onthly variation for absolute counts of the CD8(+) population (p<0.05) for Oct ober compared with June and July, whereas no significant differences were found for the other populations or in the proportions of lymphocyte subsets. Although lower than the longitudinal vari ation, the methodological variation, expressed as coefficient of variation (CV %), was in a similar range as the variation ov er time, indicating that the normal biological variation should not be overe stimated, while the met hodological inter-assay should be taken into consideration REVIEW (lymphocyte subsets): Blom B.

Lymphocytes develop from hematopoietic stem cells via common lymphocyte and various lineage-restricted precursors. This review discusses the current knowledge of human lymphocyte development and the phenot ypes and functions of the rare intermediate populations that together form th e pathways of development into T, B, and NK cells and DCs. Clearly, development of hematopoietic cells is su pported by cytokines. The studies of patients with genetic deficiencies in cytokine receptors that are discussed here have illuminated the importance of cytokines in lymphoid development. Lineag e decisions are under cont rol of transcription factors, and studies performed in the past decade have provided insi ght into transcriptional control of human lymphoid development, the results of which are summarized and discussed in this review.

Pneumococcal vaccination in older adults induces antibodies with low opsonic capacity and reduced antibody potency. Vaccine. 26(43):5521-6, 2008 Oct 9 ABSTRACT: The primary mode of prevention of a dult disease from Streptococcus pneumoniae is vaccination with anti-capsular poly saccharide vaccine; however, its e ffects are less in the targeted older population than in young persons. Few studies have examined the mechanism behind this limited effectiveness. We have measured anti body concentrations and opsonization titers for multiple serotypes amongst both old adults and young, healthy controls. To avoid specificity problems associated with pneumococcal antibody ELISA, we absorbed the serum samples with c- polysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide of 22F type. Antibody concentrations were found to be similar for six out of the seven tested seroty pes, while opsonization titers were significantly higher in six out of seven serotypes in the younger population. Antibody potency, as measured by the ratio of opsonization titer to antibody concentration, was found to be significantly higher for the younger subjects for all serotypes. We conclude that, while all ages of adults make similar concentrations of antibodies in response to pneumococcal vaccine, the effectiveness of those antibodies is significantly reduced in the older adult population. F. Established and Evolving I mmune-based Treatment Modalities 1. Glucocorticoids and Immunosuppressants (also see Section III.A.) REVIEW: Barnes PJ. \"Mechanisms and resistance in glucocorticoid control of inflammation,\" J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2010 M ay 31;120(2-3):76-85. Epub 2010 Feb 25. Glucocorticoids are the most effective anti-inf lammatory therapy for many chronic inflammatory and immune diseases, such as asthma, but are relatively ineffective in ot her diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by several mechanisms. Glucocorticoids suppress the multiple inflammatory genes that are activated in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma , by reversing histone acetylation of activated inflammatory genes through binding of liganded gl ucocorticoid receptors (GR) to coactivator molecules and recruitment of histone deacetylas e-2 (HDAC2) to the activated transcription complex. At higher concentrations of glucoc orticoids GR homodimers interact with DNA recognition sites to activate tr anscription through increased histone acetylation of anti- inflammatory genes and transcrip tion of several genes linked to glucocorticoid side effects. Decreased glucocorticoid responsiven ess is found in patients with severe asthma and asthmatics 341who smoke, as well as in all pa tients with CO PD and cystic fibros is. Several molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance have no w been identified. HDAC2 is markedly reduced in activity and expression as a result of oxidative/nitrative stress so that inflammation becomes resistant to the anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids. Di ssociated glucocorticoids have been developed to reduce side effects but so far it has been difficult to dissociate anti- inflammatory effects from adverse effects. In pati ents with glucocorticoid resistance alternative anti-inflammatory treatments are being investig ated as well as drugs that may reverse the molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid resistance.

OBJECT IVES: To evaluate expression and interaction of HDACs with glucocorticoid receptor isoforms in bronchoalveolar lavage mononuclear fro m steroid-resistant versus steroid-sensitive patients with asthma. METHODS: Expression of HDACs 1 th rough 11 was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction in primary cells and in the DO11.10 cell line, designed to overexpress glucocorticoid receptor . Glucocorticoid receptor expression was inhibited in bronchoalveolar lavage cells by small interfering RNA. Human HDAC2 promoter fragments were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector, and transiently transfected with glucocorticoid receptor - and - encoding plasmids into the cells. Luciferase activity was then assayed in response to glucocorticoids. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Levels of HDAC2 mRNA, but not other histone deacetylases, were significantly decr eased in bronchoalveolar lavage cells but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells fro m steroid-resistant patients w ith asthma. Overexpression of glucocorticoid receptor in DO11.10 cells selectively reduced HDAC2 mRNA and protein levels. Silencing of glucocorticoid receptor in bronchoalveolar lavage cells from patients with asthma increased HDAC2 mRNA .

This highlights a novel mechanism by which glucocorticoid receptor promotes steroid insensitivity REVIEW: Ito K, Chung KF, Adcock IM. Update actionand resistance. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006 Mar;117(3):522-43. Extensive development of inhaled and oral glucocor ticoids has resulted in hi ghly potent molecules that have been optimized to target activity to the lung and minim ize systemic exposure. These have proved highly effective for most asthmatic subjec ts, but despite these developments, there are a number of subjects with asthma who fail to respond to even high doses of inhaled or even oral glucocorticoids. Advances in delineating the fundame ntal mechanisms of cofactor 342recruitment, have resu lted in better understanding of the molecular mechanisms whereby glucocorticoids suppress inflammation. The ex istence of multiple mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid insensitivity raises the possibility th at this might indeed re flect different diseases with a common phenotype, and studies examining the efficacy of potential new agents should be targeted toward subgroups of patients with severe corticosteroid-resistant asthma who clearly require effective new drugs and other approaches to improved asthma control. REVIEW: Niven AS, Argyros G. Alternate treatments in asthma. Chest 2003;123:1254-1265. Asthma is a disease that is characterized by ai rway inflammation and is manifested by pulmonary symptoms, reversible airway obstruction, and ev idence of bronchial hyperreactivity. Standard asthma therapy, as defined by the management guidelines issued in 1999 by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, includes or al and inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists, short- acting and long-acting -agonists, cromolyn, and nedocromil. Although these agents are generally successful at controlling asthma symptoms, ther e remains a small but significant number of patients with persistent symptoms, frequent ex acerbations, and objective pulmonary abnormalities despite maximum standard therapy. The long-term use of oral and high-dose inhaled corticosteroids can be associated with significant side effects, prompting research efforts to identify alternate agents that are effective in the treatment of asth ma. The purpose of this review is to characterize the type of patie nt who may benefit from alternat e, nonsteroidal agents and to examine the current evidence behind their use. Although the use of a variety of alternate agents has been reported, we will focus in this article on agents that have been evaluated in prospective, randomized trials or have novel mechanisms of action. Anti-IgE and soluble interleukin (IL)-4 receptor therapy have been the subject of several re views, and therefore will not be included in this discussion. REVIEW: Nelson RP, Ballow M.

BACKGROUND: Anaphylaxis is a se rious hypersensitivity reaction that is rapid in onset and may result in death. A number of guidelines recomm end glucocorticoids for the treatment of people experiencing anaphylaxis. OBJECTIVES: We s ought to assess the benefits and harms of glucocorticoid treatment during episodes of ana phylaxis. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlle d Trials (CENTRAL) (The Co chrane Library 2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1966 to September 2009), EMBASE (Ovid) (1988 to September 2009), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (to September 2009) and The Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI- EXPANDED) (1945 to September 2009) . We also searched the UK National Research Register and websites listing ongoing trials and contacted international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material. We sought to in clude randomized and quasi -randomized controlled trials comparing glucocorticoids with any cont rol (either placebo, adrena line (epinephrine), an antihistamine, or any combination of these). Tw o authors independently assessed articles for inclusion. RESULTS: None of the 2496 reports identified satisfied the inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is no evidence from high-quality studies for the use of steroids in the emergency management of ana phylaxis. Therefore, we can neither support nor refute the use of these drugs for this purpose.

BACKGROUND: Severe asthma occurs in a hete rogeneous group of patients in whom symptoms and airway inflammation persist despite maxima l antiasthma treatment. OBJECTIVE: To verify whether a short-term course of oral steroids would modify sputum inflammatory cytokine and sputum eosinophil concentrations and whether this effect is related to th e presence of sputum eosinophilia. METHODS: In 59 patients with severe refractory asthma, we measured pulmonary function and inflammatory markers in hypertonic saline-induced sputum before and after 2 weeks of treatment with 0.5 mg/kg of oral prednisone (n = 39) or placebo (n = 20) daily. Selected sputum portions were assayed for total and differential ce ll counts and supernatant interleukin (IL) 5 and IL-8 concentrations. RESULTS: At baseline, no statistical differe nces were found among placebo- and prednisone-treated patients in terms of sputum inflammatory cell percentages an d IL-5 and IL- 8 concentrations. After treatment, forced expirato ry volume in 1 second significantly increased and sputum eosinophil percentages and IL-5 and IL-8 concentrations significantly decreased in the prednisone group, whereas no changes were observed in the placebo group. The positive effect of prednisone treatment was observed only in patients with baseline sputum eosinophilia, whereas in noneosinophilic patients with severe asthma pre dnisone induced only a significant decrease of sputum IL-8.

BACKGROUND: Modification of allergens by glutaraldehyde in extracts used for immunotherapy reduces the risk for side-effects, but the therapeuti c efficacy of such extracts still requires further evaluation. The aim of this study was to show th e efficacy and safety of immunotherapy with a single-strength glutaraldehyde-modified alumin ium multi-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind setting, starting in 2001 between 1 August and 15 December, birch pollen-allergic subjects (n = 62) were injected subcutaneously with increasing doses of the allerg en extract or placebo at weekly intervals over a 6-week period (or longer if adve rse reactions occurred). Maintena nce dose was given monthly for at least 18 months till June 2003. Efficacy was eval uated on the basis of the clinical index score (CIS), a combined symptom and medication score. RESULTS: Fi fty-eight patients could be evaluated for clinical efficacy. Treatment with the birch pollen extract resulted in a lower CIS for the eye and nose during the peak birch pollen se ason of 2003, compared with placebo (reductions of 42% and 31%, respectively) (P = 0.017 and 0.039). Active treatment induced IgG and IgG4 antibodies reacting with Bet v 1 (Po0.001). Sera from treated patients had a blocking effect on Bet v 1-induced basophil activation (Po0.04). No ma jor adverse reactions occurred, and local Reactions, if occurring, were m ild. Conclusion Immunotherapy with a modified slow-release birch pollen extract, administered in a single-strength pr eparation with a rapid dose increase, is safe and efficacious.

Our objective was the constructi on, purification and immunologic characterization of a genetically modified deriva tive of the major timothy grass pollen allergen, Phl p 1 for immunotherapy of grass pollen allerg y.

Immune responses to derivative were st udied in BALB/c mice. RESULTS: Grass-pollen- allergic patients exhibited greater than an 85% reduction in IgE reactivity to the mosaic as compared with the Phl p 1 alle rgen and basophil activation expe riments confirmed the reduced allergenic activity of the mosaic. It also induced less Phl p 1-spec ific IgE antibodies than Phl p 1 upon immunization of mice.

Lipocalin allergens, which contain most of the important animal-derived respiratory sensitizers, induce T helper type 2 (Th2) devi ation, but the reasons for this are not clear. To explore the prospects for peptide-based alle rgen immunotherapy and to elucidate the characteristics of the immunodominant epitope of Bos d 2, BALB/c mice were immunized with a peptide containing the epitope, peptides containing its analogues, peptides from the corresponding regions of other lipocalin proteins, and peptides with a homologous sequence. We observed that murine spleen cells recognized the immunodominant epitope of Bos d 2, p127-142, in almost the same way as human Bos d 2-specific T cells did. Enzyme- linked immunosorbent spot-forming cell assay (ELISPOT) analyses showed that p127-142 and a corresponding peptide from horse Equ c 1 induced a Th2-deviated cellular response, whereas a homologous bacterial peptide from Spiroplasma citri induced a Th0-type response. Interestingly, the spleen cell response to the bacterial peptide and p127-142 was cross-reactive, that is, able to induce reciprocally the proliferation and cytokine production of primed spleen cells in vitro. More importantly, the peptides were able to skew the phenotype of T cel ls primed with the other peptide. Our results suggest that modified peptides can be useful in allergen immunotherapy. REVIEW: 346L. Cox. \"Accelerated immunotherapy Ann Allergy Immunol. 2006;97:126-138. OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive ev aluation of build-up schedules in and cl inical efficacy. DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed studies and review articles were se lected from the PubMed database for articles published in the years 1976 to 2006 using the following keywords: rush, cluster immunotherapy in combination with allergic rhinitis , asthma, Hymenoptera, and imported fi re ant. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected if they provided safety a nd efficacy information on accelerated allergen immunotherapy schedules. Most of the studies reviewed were double-blind, placebo controlled, but some open-observational studie s were included if they provide d immunotherapy safety or other information the author thought was relevant. RESU LTS: A wide range of systemic reactions were reported in the literature with i nhalant allergens: ranging from 27% to 100% of the patients in rush immunotherapy studies and 0% to 79% of patients in the cluster studies. Pr edictors of systemic reactions with rush immunotherapy were forced expiratory volume in 1 second less than 80% of predicted and a high degree of skin test reactiv ity. Premedication clearly reduces the risk of systemic reactions with rush immunotherapy, but th e effect on cluster schedules was not as clear. CONCLUSION: Accelerated immunotherapy build-up schedules in selected patients may provide a rapid alternative to conventional build-up sche dules without a significant increase in risk.

There has therefore been considerable interest in alternative routes for delivery of allergen immunotherapy, particularly the sublingual route. The objectiv e was to evaluate the efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), compared with placebo, for reductions in symptoms and medication requirements. The Cochrane Controlled C linical Trials Regist and Scisearch were sear ched, up to September 2002, using the terms (Rhin* OR hay fever) AND (immunotherap* OR dese nsiti*ation) AND (subli ngual). All studies identified by the searches were assessed by th e reviewers to identify Randomized Controlled Trials involving participants with symptoms of allergic rhinitis and pr oven allergen sensitivity, treated with SLIT or correspondi ng placebo. Data from identified studies was abstracted onto a standard extraction sheet and s ubsequently entered into RevMan 4.1. Analysis was performed by the method of standardized mean differences (S MD) using a random effects model. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the type of allergen administered, the age of part icipants and the duration of treatment. Twentytwo trials involving 979 patients, we re included. There were six trials of SLIT for house dust mite allergy, five for grass pollen, five for pari etaria, two for olive and one each for, ragweed, cat, tree and cupressus. Five studies enroll ed exclusively children. Seventeen studies administered the allergen by sublingual drops subsequently swallowed, three by drops subsequently spat out and two by sublingual tabl ets. Eight studies invo lved treatment for less 347than 6 months, 10 studies for 6-12 months and four studies for greater than 12 m onths. All included studies were double-blind placebo- controlled trials of parallel group design. Concealment of treatment allocat ion was considered adequate in all studies and the use of identical placebo preparations was almost universal. There was significant heterogeneity, most likely due to widely differing scoring systems between studies, for most comparisons. Overall there was a significant reduction in both sympto ms (SMD -0.42, 95% confidence interval -0.69 -0.23); P = 0.00003] Subgroup analyses failed to identify a dispropor tionate benefit of treatment according to the allergen administ ered. There was no significant reduction in symptoms and medication scores in those studies involving only children but total numbers of participants was too small to make this a reliable conclusion. Increasing duration of treatment does not clearly increase efficacy. The total dose of allergen admi nistered may be important but insufficient data was available to analyze this factor. REVIEW PEPTIDE IMMUNOTHERAPY: Larche M May;26(2):321-32 Synthetic peptides representing T- cell epitopes of allergens and au toantigens have been employed to induce antigen-specific tolera nce in vivo in experimental m odels and the clinical setting. delivery of peptides orally or by injection lead s to reduced reactivity to antigen accompanied by the induction of T cells w ith a regulatory phenotype. Peptide th erapy may provide a safe, effective, and economically viable approach for disease-modifying thera py in autoimmune and allergic diseases. RESEARCH FRONTIER: Creticos P. S., Schroeder J. T., Hamilton R. G Immunotherapy with a Ragweed-Toll-Like Recepto r 9 Agonist Vaccine offers a new approach to allergen im munotherapy that reduces acute a llergic responses. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of a vaccine consisting of Amb a 1, a ragweed-pollen antigen, conjugated to a phosphorothioate ol igodeoxyribonucleotide immunostimulatory sequence of DNA (AIC) in 25 a dults who were allergic to ragweed. Patients received six weekly injections of the AIC or placebo vaccine before the first ragweed season and were monitored during the next two ragweed seasons. RESULTS: There was no pattern of vaccine-associated systemic reactions or clinic ally significant laboratory abnormalities. AIC did not alter the primary end point, the vascular permeabil ity response (measured by the albumin level in nasal-lavage fluid) to na sal provocation. During the first ragweed season, the AIC group had better peak-season rhinitis scores on the visual-analogue scale (P=0.006), peak-season diary scores (P=0.02), and midseason overall quality-of-life scores (P=0.05) than the placebo group. AIC induced a transient increase in Amb a 1-specific IgG antibody but suppressed the seasonal increase in Amb a 1-specific IgE antibody. A reduction in the number of interleukin- basophils scores (r=0.49, P=0.03). Clinical benefits of AIC were ag ain observed in the subsequent ragweed season, with improvements over placebo in peak-season rhinit is visual-analogue scores (P=0.02) and peak- 348season daily nasal symptom diary scores (P=0.02). The seasonal specific IgE antibody response was again suppressed, with no significant change in IgE antibody titer during the ragweed season (P=0.19). CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, a 6-week regimen of the AIC vaccine appeared to offer long-term clinical efficacy in the treatment of ragweed allergic rhinitis. 3. Cellular immune reconstruction including stem cell and bone marrow transplant REVIEW: TJ Fry and CL Mackall. \"Immune Marrow Transplantation 2005; 35, S53-S57. Successful hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation re quires rapid and complete transfer of the donor hematopoietic and immune systems to th e host. Whereas the unc ontrolled transfer of a nontolerant donor immune system results in GVHD in many cases, strategies which diminish GVHD also diminish immune reconstitution. Thus, the reliable, rapid a nd safe transfer of immunity from donor to host remains a major challenge for the field. Advances in the understanding of the biology of im mune reconstitution have elucid ated that thymic-dependent immune reconstitution can restore global immunit y, but is especially vulnerable to toxicities associated with transplant. Alternatively, homeostatic peripheral expansion can be exploited for targeted immunity toward pathogens and tumors, but is difficult to manipulate without exacerbating GVHD risk. New translatable strategies are needed to safely augment one or both of these pathways in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic in vivo alemtuzumab dose befo re reduced intensity stem the risk graft-versus-host (GVHD) and nonrelapse mortality after reduced intensit y allogeneic transplantation. Ho wever, it also delays immune reconstitution, leading to frequent infections and potential loss of graft-versus-tumor responses. Here, we tested the feasibility of alemtuzumab dose deescalation in the context of fludarabine- melphalan conditioning human leukocyte antige n (HLA)- identical sibling transplantation. Alemtuzumab was given 1-2 days before graft in fusion, and dose reduced from 60 mg to 20 mg in 4 sequential cohorts (total n = 106). Pharmacokinetic studies were fitted to a linear, 2-compartment model in which dose reduction led to incomple te saturation of CD52 binding sites and greater antibody clearance. Increased elimination was partic ularly evident in the 20- mg group in patients who had CD52-expressing tumors at time of tran splantation. The 20-mg dose was also associated with greater risk of severe GVHD (acute grade III-IV or chronic extensive) compared with > 20 mg (hazard ratio, 6.7; 95% CI, 2.5-18.3). In cont rast, dose reduction to 30 mg on day 1 was associated with equivalent clinical outcomes to higher doses but better ly mphocyte recovery at 12 months. In conclusion, alemtuzuma b dose reduction to 30 mg is safe in the context of reduced intensity conditioning and HLA-identical sibling transplantation. 349META-ANALYSIS: al. \"Immune reconstitutio n inflammatory syndrome in patients starting antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis,\" J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006 Apr;117(4Suppl):S525053 In patients with HIV-1 infection who are startin g combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), the incidence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is not well defined. We did a meta-analysis to establish the in cidence and lethality of the syndr ome in patients with a range of previously diagnosed opportunist ic infections, and examined th e relation between occurrence and the degree of immunodeficiency. Systematic review identified 54 cohort st udies of 13,103 patients starting ART, of whom 1699 develo ped IRIS. We calculated pooled cumulative incidences with 95% credibility interval s (CrI) by Bayesian methods and did a random-effects metaregression to analyse the relation between CD4 cell count and in cidence of IRIS. In patients with previously diagnosed AIDS-defining illnesses, IRIS develope d in 37\u00b77% progressive multifocal of uns elected patients starti ng ART developed any type of IRIS. 4\u00b75% (2\u00b71-8\u00b76) of pa tients with any type of IRIS di ed, 3\u00b72% (0\u00b77-9\u00b72) of those with tuberculosis-associated IRIS died, and 20\u00b78% (5\u00b70-52\u00b77) of those with cryptococcal meningitis died. Metaregression analyses showed that the risk of IRIS is asso ciated with CD4 cell count at the start of ART, with a high risk in patients with fewer than 50 cells per L. Occurrence of IRIS might therefore be reduced by initiation of ART before immunodeficiency becomes advanced. REVIEW: Hassan HT. El-Sheemy M.

Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy Orange JS , intravenous immunoglobulin in human disease: A review of evidence by members o f the Primary Immunodeficiency Committee of th e American Academy of Allergy,Asthma and Immunology,\" J Allergy Current usage of intravenous immune globulin and the rationale behind it: the Massachusetts General Hospital data and a REVIEW: of the literature. Transfusion. 2006;46(5):741-53. BACKGROUND: Intravenous immune globulin (I VIG) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in 6 conditions: immune thromboc ytopenic purpura (ITP), primary immunodeficiency, secondary immunodeficiency, pediatric HIV infection, Kawasaki disease, prevention of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and infection in bone marrow transplant recipients. However, most usage is for off-label indications, and for some of these comprehensive 350guidelines have been published. STUDY DE SIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all approved IVIG transf usions at Massachusetts G eneral Hospital in 2004 to identify the current usage pattern and completed a literatu re review. RESULTS: IVIG was most commonly used in the treatment of chronic neuropathy, whic h included chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropa thy. For such patients, the annual cost of IVIG can exceed 50,000 dollars per patient. Other common indications were the treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia, ITP, renal transplant re jection, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, fasciitis, autoimmune hemoly tic anemia, and Kawasaki disease. IVIG was administered in a variety of other indications ea ch representing <3% of the total treated patients. CONCLUSION: Only a few indications account for most of the usage for IVIG. Reports concerning IVIG continue to grow at a tremendous pace but few high-quality randomized controlled trials have been reported. Randomized trials are especially needed for conditions such as CIDP, which consume large quantities of product.

J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2006;117:S525-53 Human nous administration (IGIV) has a number of important uses in the treatment of disease. Some of these are in diseases for which acceptable treatment alternatives do not exis t. In this review we have ev aluated the evidence underlying a wide variety of IGIV uses and make specific recommendations on the basis of these data. Given the potential risks and inherent s carcity of IGIV, careful consideration of the indications for and administration of IGIV is warranted. REVIEW: Toubi E, Etzioni A. Intravenous immunode 2005 Dec;29(3):167-72 Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been used successfully for hypogammaglobulinemic states for more than 20 yr. In both pr imary and secondary situations when hypogammaglobulinemia is of clinical significance, IVIg should be the first line of treatment. In most cases, 400 mg/kg infused every 3 to 4 wk will lead to a tr ough level higher than 500 mg/dL, which in most cases provides good protecti on against bacterial infections. Higher doses may be needed in patients with known lung da mage. Side effects include headache, nausea, chills, and fever but can be minimized by lowe ring the infusion speed rate. Rarely, aseptic meningitis may develop but it is always reversib le. Although all products have been shown to be beneficial, differences among the various products have still been reporte d. In this regard, all products should be standardized according to common accepted internat ional parameters. The route of immunoglobulin G replaceme nt (intravenously vs subcutan eously) was reported to be of similar benefit. However, gui delines for usage and choice of route should be established and might be of help. REVIEW: 351Ochs HD, Gupta S, Kiessling P Safety and efficacy of self-ad ministered subcutaneous immunoglobulin in patients fusions at 3-4 week intervals are currently standard therapy in the United States for patients with primary i mmune deficiency diseases (PIDD). To evaluate alternative modes of immunoglobul in administration we have designed an open-label study to investigate the efficacy and safety of a subcut aneously administered immunoglobulin preparation (16% IgG) in patients with PI DD. After their final IVIg infu sion, 65 patients entered a 3-month, wash-in/wash-out phase, designe d to bring patients to steady- state with subcutaneously administered immunoglobulin. This was followed by 12 months of weekly SCIg infusions, at a dose determined in a pharmacokinetic substudy to provide noninferior intrav ascular exposure. This resulted in a mean weekly dose of 158 mg/ kg, calculated to equal 137% of the previous intravenous dose. Two patients (4%) each reported 1 serious bacterial infection (pneumonia), an annual rate of 0.04 per patient-year. There were 4.43 infections of a ny type per patient-year. Mean trough serum IgG levels increased from 786 to 1040 mg/dl during the study, a mean increase of 39%. The most frequent treatment-related adverse event was in fusion-site reaction, reported by 91% of patients; this was predominantly mild or moderate, and the incidence decreased over time. No treatment-related serious adve rse events were reported. We conclude that subcutaneous administration of 16% SCIg is a safe and effectiv e alternative to IVIg fo r replacement therapy of PIDD. 5. Nucleic Acid Based Therapies (DNA va nucleotides) Biological Approaches in Asthma: DNA-Based Therapy,\" Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2007, 14, 1607-1618 Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation, bronchial hyper-responsive ness, and reversible airway obstruction. Medications for asthma include corticosteroids, b2-adrenergic receptor agonists, chromones, methylxant hines, and leukotriene modifiers. Despite these advances in therapy, many symptoms are not well controlled. Since asthma is a chronic airway inflammation with a bias towards a type 2 T helper (Th2) ce ll response, some new approaches are targeted towards the Th2 inflammation pathway. These include anti-IgE therapy, anti-Th2 cytokine therapy, and therapies aiming at increasing Th1 cy tokines. This article will focus on DNA-based therapy, a novel therapeutic st rategy for asthma. Immunostimul atory gene therapy using CpG oligodeoxynucleotides with central deoxycytidyl (CpG) dinucleotide, in which the cytosine nucleobase is unmethylated, can s timulate the innate immunity and augment Th1 response. With DNA gene therapy, genes can be introduced to target Th1 cytokines or other mediators in the airway in or der to counteract Th2 inflammation in asthma. Also, antisense oligonucleotides can target mRNA species of interest in asthma. Through these therapies, we can expect long-lasting effects, bett er control of symptoms, and re ducing medication in the future. REVIEW: Tsalik EL. DNA-based immunotherapy to treat Astham a & Immunology: 2005;95:403-10. OBJECTIVE: To review the current literature regarding DNA-based immunotherapy with respect to signa ling mechanisms, cytokine profiles, and th e applicability and success of this strategy to treat allergic disease. DATA SOURCES: English-language articl es were identified from the PubMed database using both standard and clinic al queries. Search terms included CpG, allergy, atopic disease, immunotherapy, DNA vaccination, immunomodulation, and immunostimulatory DNA. Other sources included bibliographies from relevant ar ticles. STUDY SELECTION: Recent studies that provide informa tion about the mechanisms or applications of DNA-based immunotherapy with respect to atopic disease ar e included in this revi ew. RESULTS: DNA-based immunotherapy composed of unmethylated CpG re peats is capable of in ducing a shift in the cytokine profile and immune response that fa vors the T(H)1 arm. This observation makes DNA- based immunotherapy a promising candidate for th e treatment of atopic diseases, which are known to be mediated by T(H)2-based responses. Ea rly animal and human trials of DNA-based immunotherapy have shown the strategy to be bo th safe and effective. CONCLUSIONS: DNA- based immunotherapy, although still in the early stages of development, has thus far been shown to be both safe and effective for a va riety of atopic diseases and offe rs the potential for significant improvements over current immunotherapy protocols.

Cytokine receptors and receptor antagonists (IFN, antiTNF, etc) REVIEW: Scott P. Commins, and chemokines are secreted proteins involved in numerous aspects of cell growth, differentiation, and activation. A prominent featur e of these molecules is their effect on the immune system with regard to cell trafficking and development of immune tissue and organs. The nature of an immune response determines which cytokines are produced and ultimately whether the response is cytotoxic, humoral, cell mediated , or allergic. For this chapter, cytokines are grouped according to those that are predominantly antigen-presenting cell or T lymphocyte derived; that mediate cytotoxic, humoral, cell mediated, and allergic immunity; or that are immunosuppressive. A discussion of chemokine function and their role in cell trafficking and disease follows.

Interleukin (IL)-17 is recognized to play a crit ical role in numerous immune and inflammatory responses by regulating the expression of vari ous inflammatory mediators, which include cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. There is growing evidence that IL-17 is involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. IL-17 orchestrates the neutrophilic influx in to the airways and also enhances T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated eosinop hilic airway inflammation in asthma. Recent studies have demonstrated that not only inhibitor of IL-17 per se but also di verse regulators of IL- 17 expression reduce antigen-induced airway in flammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and Th2 cytokine levels in animal models of asthma. This review will summarize the role of IL-17 in the context of allergic airway inflammation and discuss the therapeutic potential of various strategies targeting IL-17 for asthma. 354REVIEW: Antonella Viola, and Andrew D.

For a long time, most drugs were small chemicals called xenobiotics that occasionally caused side effects. These were explained by the pharmacologic action of the drug (type A) or were related to the susceptibility of the individual to the drug (type B, idiosyncratic drug reactions ). Most of the type B reactions were immune mediated. In addition, some investigators exte nded this classification and used type C for (chemical) reactions relate d to the chemical structure and its metabolism, for example, paracetamol hepatotoxicity; type D, corresponding to delaye d reactions that appear after many years of treatment, for example, bladder carcinoma after treatment with cyclophosphamide; and type E (end of treatment) reactions occurri ng after drug withdrawal, for exam ple, seizures after stopping phenytoin. This subclassification of side effects is focused on small chemical compounds, but is considered less suitable for proteins used as drugs.1 Biological respon se modifiers, commonly abbreviated as ''biologicals,'' represent a new ca tegory of drugs designed to be as similar to human proteins as possible.1 The no menclature of biologicals seems to be arbitrary at first glance, but it is strictly regulated.2 Taki ng infliximab as an example, th e first 1 or 2 syllables can be chosen freely; in this case ''inf -.'' The following syllable derives from the target structure or target disease, here ''-li-'' for immune syst em. The next syllable denotes the species of orig in, ''-xi-'' for chimeric murine-human origin. The last syllable sta nds for the therapeutic principle, in this case ''- mab'' for monoclonal antibody. Alternative final syllables are ''-ce pt'' for soluble receptors and ''-inib'' for receptor antagonists. Biological res ponse modifiers interact specifically with the immune system (Table 1) and target distinct cell surface structures, for example, cytokine receptors, tumor-specific antigens, or soluble medi ators (cytokines, interferons). Biologicals have turned out to be potent and eff ective therapeutic tools for vari ous inflammatory, autoimmune, and oncologic diseases. Their direct and focused effect renders them superior to classic immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs, whose us e is often limited by unwanted and frequently 356severe generalized side effects. In 2006, the mo lecular targeted therapies in oncology accounted fo r 44% of the total sales of th e top 20 cancer therapy brands, overtaking the cytotoxic therapies for the first time.3 The side effects seen with clas sic xenobiotics seem to differ considerably from the ones associated with biologicals concerning th eir pathogenesis and consequences for future therapy (Table 2). It is beyond the scope of this article to cover the adve rse side effects of all biologicals in detail. Instead typi cal clinical manifestations are presented, and general rules for treating these and guiding late r allergological workup as well as a possible classification scheme are proposed.

BACKGROUND: Patients with hypereosinophilic s yndrome (HES) vary considerably in their clinical presentation with regard to the severity and pattern of end-organ involvement. Clinical manifestations range from nonspecific symptoms to life-threatening, multisystem damage caused by eosinophil infiltration and loca l release of proinflammatory mediators and toxic granule products from these invading cells. The primary objective of treatment is to reduce blood and tissue eosinophilia and prevent eosi nophil-mediated tissue damage as safely as possible. Systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are first-line therapy for the management of patients with symptomatic HES who lack the Fip1-like 1-platel et-derived growth factor receptor-(FIP1L1- ib, is first-line treatment for FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive patients. Because of the t oxicity and serious side-effects that can occur with oral corticosteroids, alternative therapies may need to be introduced to reduce the cumulative corticosteroid exposure while maintaining disease control. SCOPE: Among corticosteroid-sparing agents cytotoxic drugs and interferon- ; anti-interleukin-5 (IL-5 ) monoclonal antibodies are also currently under investigation for the treatment of HES. This manuscript reviews the available treatments for HES and the range of side-effects a ssociated with long-term corticosteroid use, and then focuses on the anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies, mepolizumab and reslizumab. Of these, only 357mepolizuma b has been studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

CONCLUSION: ed eosinophil-directed therapy w ith an anti-IL-5 neutralizing monoclonal antibody reduced the need for corticosteroids in these thr ee HES patients without disease exacerbations. REVIEW: Adcock, I. M., K. F. Chung, et al. Kinase inhibitors and airway inflammation. Eur J Pharmacol 2006;533:118-32. Kinases are believed to play a crucial role in the expression and activ ation of inflammatory mediators in the airway, in T-cell function and airway remodelli ng. Important kinases such as Inhibitor of kappaB kinase kinases and phsopho-inositol (PI)3 kinase regulate inflammati on either through activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as activating protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), which are activated in airway disease, or through regulation of mRNA half-life. Selective kinase inhibitors have been developed which reduce inflammation and some characteristics of disease in animal models. Targeting specific kinases that are overe xpressed or over active in disease should allow for selective treatment of respiratory diseases. In terest in this area has intensified due to the success of the specific Abelson leuk aemia. Encouraging data from animal models and primary cells and early Phase I and II studies in other diseases suggest that inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase and IKK2 may prove to be useful novel therapies in the treatment of severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis and other inflammatory airway diseases. REVIEW: Mankad V. S. Burks AW Omalizumab: other indications and unanswered questions. Clin Immunol antibody against immunoglobulin (Ig)E, represents a unique therapeutic approach for the treat ment of allergic diseases . This agent acts as a neutralizing antibody by binding IgE at the same site as the high-affinity receptor. Subsequently, IgE is prevented from sensitizing cells bearing high- affinity receptors. Inhibition of the biological effects of IgE targets an early phase of the a llergic cascade before the generation of allergic symptoms. Currently, omalizumab has been approve d for the treatment of persistent allergic asthma in patients who are poorly controlled with inhaled corticosteroids. However, other allergic disorders may be amenable to treatment with omaliz umab because of its abil ity to inhibit effector functions of IgE. Studies of omalizumab in the tr eatment of allergic rhinitis comprise the greater part of the literature pertaining to the use of this agent for cl inical indications other than asthma. This article summarizes clinical trials of omalizumab in allergic rhinitis and examines the evidence regarding the effects of omalizumab on the pa thophysiological mechanisms underlying allergic 358rhinitis. Additiona lly, we consider the role of this novel therapeutic agent in combination with specific allergen immunotherapy and discuss othe r potential indications for omalizumab in IgE- mediated disorders, including food allergy, latex allergy, atopic dermatitis, and chronic urticaria.

Effect of tumor necrosis factor antagonis m on allergen-mediated asthmatic airway inflammation.\" Respir is factor (TNF) antagonism can attenuate eosinophilic airway inflammation patients allergic asthma. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. PATIENTS : Twenty-six patients with mild -to-moderate allergic asthma, receiving only inhaled beta-2-agoni sts, who demonstrated both an early and late ph ase response to inhalational allergen challenge. INTERVENTION: In jection of a (TNFR:Fc, etanercept, Enbrel) or placebo, 25mg subcutaneous ly, twice weekly for 2 weeks, followed by a bronchoscopic segmental allergen challenge. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was whether TNFR:Fc can access the lung and i nhibit TNF bioactivity. Secondary outcome measures included and airw ay hyperresponsiveness. RESULTS: Anti-TNF therapy was associated with transient hemiplegia in one patient, which resulted in suspension of the study. Data from the 21 participants who completed the study were analyzed. Following treatment, patients receivi ng anti-TNF therapy had significantly increased TNFR2 levels in epithelial lining fluid (ELF) (P <0.001), consistent with delivery of TNFR:Fc to the lung. TNF antagonism did not attenuate pulmona ry eosinophilia and was associated with an increase in ELF IL-4 levels (P=0.033) at 24h following segmental allergen challenge. TNF antagonism was not associated with a change in airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. CONCLUSIONS: TNF antagonism may not be e ffective for preventing allergen-mediated eosinophilic airway inflammation in mild-to-mode rate asthmatics. Transient hemiplegia, which may mimic an evolving stroke, may be a potential toxicity of anti-TNF therapy. REVIEW: Salem Z, Zalloua PA, Chehal A Effective mesylate Hematol J. 2003;4:410-2 is highly effective in chronic myeloid leukaemia and recent data have suggested that imatinib mesylate is also effec tive in the treatment of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Six patients with HES were treated daily with 100 mg imatinib mesylate. Five patients had normal karyotype and one show ed trisomy 8. RT-PCR was negative for ETV6- PDGFRB and BCR-ABL fusion mRNAs. All patients rapidly achieved comp lete haematological remission. One patient remained in remission for more than 6 weeks after discontinuing treatment. No significant side eff ect was noted.

REVIEW: Shanafelt TD, 2003;78:1340-6 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of rituxi mab for the treatment of adult patients with including idiopathic thromb ocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic Evans syndrome. PATIENTS AND M ETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of all patients trea ted with rituximab for immune cy topenia at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, through January 1, 2003. Fourteen patients (median age at first diagnosis, 51 years; range, 21-79 years) were id entified who received 1 or more treatment courses of rituximab for treatment of refractory ITP (12 patients), au toimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) (5 patients), or both ITP and AIHA (classified as Evans syndrome) (4 patients). Data re garding age, diagnosis, date of diagnosis, previous treatments, comorbid conditions , blood cell counts before taking rituximab, number of rituximab treatments, and res ponse to treatment were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Of 12 patients treated for ITP, 6 were receiving corticosteroid-based treatment either alone or combined with other immunosuppressive therapy at the time they received rituximab. Complete remission occurred in 5 (42%) of 12 patient s with ITP and in 2 (40%) of 5 patients with AIHA. Response to rituximab in patients with Ev ans syndrome was seen in either ITP or AIHA, but not both. Complete response was often durab le in ITP. Responses were seen in both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients . CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, considered with the results of other studies, sugge st that rituximab deserves early consideration as salvage therapy for immune cytopenias that are refractory to both corticosteroid treatment and splenectomy. This series represents the larges t series of adult patients with AIHA and Evans syndrome 8. Plasmapheresis and cytophoresis REVIEW: M.A. & W.F. bulinemia: Plasma pheresis transiently re moves the circulating cryoglobulins and has been advocated (in conjun ction with immunosuppressive therapy) to be effective in reducing morbidities associated with cryoglobulinemia. The goal of this paper was to review over the past 20 years th e medical literature for evidence supporting or refuting the Reported use of plasmapheresis for cryogl obulinemia (January 1988 through June 2008). METHODS: We included all reporte d literature of the use of plas ma exchange for the treatment of cryoglobulinemia that included at least five pa tients. Electronic searches were performed using MEDLINE (January 1988 through June 2008) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1988 through June 2008). RE SULTS: Of the 11 articles in cluded in this review, there were a total of 156 patients st udied. Two studies used cryofi ltration, one compared plasma exchange to double cascade filtration and the other eight dealt with plasma exchange only. Outcome measures were often not clearly defined. CONCLUSIONS: Although plasma exchange is an accepted treatment for cryoglobulinemia, ther e are no large multicentre randomized controlled trials of plasma exchange versus placebo or versus immunosuppressive therapy. Of the 11 studies from our literature search, none had a clear report of the apheresis procedures and clearly defined quantitative outcomes. The quality and variability of the evidence precludes a meta-analysis or 360even a systematic analysis. However, these studies weakly support the us e of plasm a exchange largely on a mechanistic basis. REVIEW: Chang-Qing Xiaa, Kim A.

RECENT FINDINGS: It has been suggested that ECP therapy, unlike other immunosuppressive regimens, does not cause glob al immunosuppression, but induces immune tolerance. Recen t clinical and animal studies demonstrate that ECP therapy induces antigen-specific regulatory T cells, including CD4+CD 25+FoxP3+ T cells and IL-10- producing Tr1 cells, that may aris e secondarily to the induction of tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by infusion of apoptotic cells. It has also been suggested that ECP therapy may induce IL-10-producing regulatory B cells and regulatory CD8+ T cells. Finally, several recent studies, which examined the cellular elements involved in the uptake of apoptotic cells, demonstrated that apoptotic cells modulate APCs through binding to specific receptors, particularly TAM receptors that provide inhibitory signals that block APC activation. SUMMARY: ECP therapy induces i mmune tolerance through modul ation of antigen-presenting cells as well as induction of regulatory T cells. EC P therapy has great poten tial in the management of allogeneic transplantati on and autoimmune diseases. REVIEW: Suresh G. Shelat, \"Practical Consideration s for Planning a Therapeutic Apheresis Procedure,\" The American Journal of Medicine 2010; 123, 777-784. The general medicine and critical care services often care for patients that require therapeutic apheresis. Apheresis procedures are performed for various hematologic, neurological, renal, autoimmune, metabolic, and other in dications. To facilitate a prompt start to the procedure, the clinical team must coordinate efforts with se veral services, including those that perform the apheresis procedure, establish venous access, and provide blood or replacement products, in addition to the pharmacy and clinical laboratory. Some of these tasks ar e performed typically by the clinical teams, while othe rs are performed typically by th e apheresis team. Presented and discussed are the indications fo r therapeutic apheresis, calcula tions for the ordering of blood products, and several important and practical details to consider, thus preventing delays in starting the apheresis procedure.

Using a risk-ada pted approach, we provide recommendations on timing and choice of therapy.

Any patient with symptoms of hyperviscosity should first be tr eated with plasmapheresis.

A number of studies have been performed examini ng the influence of various probiotic organisms, either alone or in combination, on immune para meters, infectious outcomes, and inflammatory conditions in humans. Some components of the immune response, including phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity and mucosa l immunoglobulin A production (espec ially in children), can be improved by some probiotic bacteria. Other com ponents, including lymphocy te proliferation, the production of cytokines and of antibodies other than immunoglobulin A appear less sensitive to probiotics. Probiotics, including lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, administered to children can reduce incidence and duration of diarrhoea, but the precise effects depend upon the nature of the condition. Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travellers' diarrhoe a in adults, but does not affect duration. The effect of probiotics on ot her infectious outcomes is less clear. Probiotics may benefit children and adults with irritable bo wel syndrome and adults with ulcerative colitis; studies in Crohn's Disease are less clear. Probiotics have little eff ect in rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotic supplementation, especially with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can reduce risk and severity of allergic disease, particular atop ic dermatitis; early supplementation appears to be 362effective. Overall, the picture that em erges from studies of probiotics on immune, infectious and inflammatory outcomes in humans is mixed and there appear to be la rge species and strain differences in effects seen. Other reasons for differences in effects seen will include dose of probiotic organism used, duration of supplementa tion, characteristics of the subjects studied, sample size, and technical differences in how the measurements were made. REVIEW: Anil Minocha. \"Probiotics for Preventive Health,\" Nutrition in Clinical 24 227-241. Gut flora and probiotics have poten tial to affect health and dis ease far beyond the gut. There is increasing evidence that Probiotic s have beneficial effects in preventing a wide range of conditions and improving health. Randomized, double- blind studies have provided evidence of the effectiveness of Probiotics for preventing various di arrheal illnesses as well as allergic disorders. Evidence for their efficacy for use in the prev ention and treatment of bacterial vaginosis and urinary tract infections is al so mounting. In addition, probiotics may be useful for preventing respiratory infections, dental cari es, necrotizing enteroco litis, and certain aspects of inflammatory bowel disease. Data also suggest that probiotic s may promote good health in day care and work settings, and may enhance growth in healthy as well as ill and malnourished children. Results from meta-analyses and systematic reviews that combine results of studies from different types of probiotics to examine the effects in any disease state should be interpreted with caution. Specific strains are effective in specific disease states. No 2 probiotics ar e exactly alike; we should not expect reproducible results from studies that employ different species or strains, variable formulations, and diverse dosing schedul es.

BACKGROUND: The an important constituent of the gut mucosal defense barrier. We have previously shown that a human intestinal floral strain, Lactobacillus GG (ATCC 53103), promotes local an tigen-specific immune responses (particularly in the IgA class), prevents permeability defects, and c onfers controlled antigen absorption. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clin ical and immunologic effects of cow's milk elimination without (n = 14) and with (n = 13) the addition of Lactobacillus GG (5 x 10(8) colony-forming units/gm formula) in an in infants with atopic eczema and cow's milk allergy. The seco nd part of the study involved 10 breast-fed infants who had atopic eczema and cow's milk a llergy. In this group Lactobacillus GG was given to nursing mothers. METHODS: The severity of atopic eczema was assessed by clinical scoring. The concentrations of fecal alpha 1- antitryps in, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and eosinophil cationic protein were determined as markers of intestinal inflammation before and after dietary intervention. RESULTS: The clinic al score of atopic dermatitis improved significantly during the 1-month study period in infants treated with the extensively hydrolyzed whey formula fortified with Lactobacillus GG. The concentration of alph a 1-antitrypsin decreased significantly in this group (p = 0.03) but not in the group receiving the whey formula without Lactobacillus GG (p = 0.68). In parallel, the median (l ower quartile to upper quartile) concentration of fecal tumor 363necrosis factor-alpha decreased significantly in this group, from 709 pg/gm (91 to 1131 pg/gm ) to 34 pg/gm (19 to 103 pg/gm) (p = 0.003), but not in those receiving the extensively hydrolyzed whey formula only (p = 0.38). The concentration of fecal eosinophil cationic protein remained unaltered during therapy. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that probiotic bacteria may promote endogenous barrier mechanisms in patients with atopic dermatitis and food allergy, and by alleviating intestinal inflamma tion, may act as a useful tool in the treatment of food allergy. REVIEW: Ogden NS and Bielort L. Probiotics: A Complementary Approach in th e Treatment and Prevention of Pediatric Atopic Disease. Curr Opin Allergy Clin Imm unol. 2005 Apr; 5(2):179-84. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal of this article is to review recent primary research and developments in the area of probiotics and pediatric atopic disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Research developments in probiotics summarized in this article include the following: (1) the role of probiotics in primary prevention of atopic disease, (2 ) the effect of probiotics on cytokines involved in the allerg ic immune response, (3) the long-term effects of peri-natal probiotic use and (4) the relationship between the gut microflora and atopic dermatitis. SUMMARY: Probiotics continue to be an area of active investiga tion as our understanding evolves of the gut microbiota's role in the altere d immune response of atopi c patients. Physicians should be aware of these developments as pr obiotics may be an important complementary approach in the treatment and the natural and long -term course of various pediatric diseases.

RESEARCH FRONTIER: Prescott SL, Dunstan JA, Hale J, Breckler L, Lehmann H, Weston S, Richmond P. Clinical Effects of Probiotics are Associated with Increased Interferon-gamma Responses in Very Young Children with Atopic Dermatitis. Clin Exp Allergy. 2005 Dec; 35(12):1557-64. BACKGROUND: We recently demonstrated that administration of probiotics resulted in significant clinical improvement in very young children with moderate -to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). The purpose of this study was to determin e the underlying immunologi cal effects that are associated with these apparent clinical bene fits. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from children (n = 53) at baseline and at the end of an 8-week supplementation period during which they re ceived a probiotic (Lactobacillus fermentum PCCtrade mark) (n = 26) or a placebo (n = 27). A further sample was collected at 16 weeks (8 weeks after ceasing the supplement). Cytokine (OVA), beta lactoglobulin (BLG), house dust mite (HDM)), vaccines (tetanus toxoid (TT)), lutinin (PHA)) were compared. RESULTS: The administration of probiotics was associated with a significant increase in T-helper type 1(Th1- type) cytokine IFN-gamma responses to PHA a nd SEB at the end of the supplementation period (week 8: P = 0.004 and 0.046) as well as 8 week s after ceasing supplem entation (week 16: P = 0.005 and 0.021) relative to baseline le vels of response. No signifi cant changes were seen in the 364placebo group. The increase in IFN-gamma responses to SEB was directly proportional to the decrease in the severity of AD (r = -0.445, P = 0.026) over the intervention period. At the end of the supplementation period (week 8) children receiving probiotics showed significantly higher TNF-alpha responses to HKLB (P = 0.018) a nd HKSA (P = 0.011) but this was no longer evident when supplem entation ceased (week 16). Although IL-13 responses to OVA were significantly reduced in childre n receiving probiotics after 8 weeks (P = 0.008), there were no other effects on allergen-specific responses, and this effect was not sustained after ceasing supplementation (week 16). There were no effect s on vaccine-specific responses, or on responses to any of the stimuli assessed. CONCLUSION: Th e improvement in AD severity with probiotic treatment was associated with si gnificant increas es in the capacity for Th1 IFN-gamma responses and altered responses to skin and enteric flora. This effect was still evident 2 months after the supplementation was ceased. The lack of consis tent effects on allerg en-specific responses suggests that the effects of probiotics may be mediated throu gh other independent pathways, which need to be explored further. 10. Unproven and Controversial therapies REVIEW: B. W\u00fcthrich. \"Unproven Mainstream allergy diagnosis and treatm ent is based on classical allergy testing which involves well validated diagnos tic methods and proven methods of treatment. By contrast, a number of unproven tests have been proposed for evaluating allergic patients including cytotoxic food testing, ALCAT test, bioresonance, electr odermal testing reflexology, applied kinesiology a.o. There is li ttle or no scientific rationale fo r these methods. Results are not reproducible when subject to rigorous testing and do not correlate with clinical evidence of allergy. Although some papers suggest a possible pathogenet ic role of IgG, IgG4 antibody, no correlation was found between the outcome of DBPCFC and the levels of either food-specific IgG or IgG4, nor was any difference seen between patients and controls. The levels of these and other food- specific immunoglobulins of non-IgE is otype reflect the intake of f ood in the individual and may thus be a normal and harmless finding. The so-c alled \"Food Allergy Profile\" with simultaneous IgE and IgG determination against more than 100 foodstuffs is neither eco nomical nor useful for diagnosis. DBPCFC must be the reference standa rd for food hypersensitivity and any new test must be validated by it. As a result, all these unproven techniques may lead to misleading advice or treatments, and their use is not advised. REVIEW: Kirsten Beyer & Suzanne and unproven procedures,\" in All ergy and Clinical Immunology 2005, 5:261-266. PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: The accu rate diagnosis of food aller gy is crucial not only for the right treatment but also for th e avoidance of unnecessary diets. The diagnostic work-up of suspected food allergy includes th e measurement of food-specific IgE antibodies using serologic assays, the skin prick test, elimination diets and oral provocation tests. In addition, some approaches are either under further rigorous investigation (the at opy patch test) or are already in widespread use, particularly by practitioners of alternative or complementary medicine, but are considered unproven. These diagnostic methods include specific IgG to foods, provocation/neutraliz ation testing, kinesiology, cytotoxic tests and electrodermal testing. This 365review covers some of t he most common scientif ically validated and unproven approaches used in the diagnosis of food allergy. RECENT FINDINGS: For specific serum IgE and the SPT, decision points have been established for some foods, allo wing prediction of clinical relevance. The APT may be helpful, especially when considered in comb ination with defined levels of specific IgE. In regard to other approaches, most scientific studies do refute the usefulness of these approaches. SUMMARY: In most patients, controlled oral f ood challenges remain the gold standard in the diagnostic work-up of suspected food allergy. The skin prick test and measurement of specific IgE antibodies to food extracts, individu al allergens or allerg enic peptides are helpful in the diagnostic approach. Foodspecific IgG continues to be an unproven or experimental test . The other alternative and complementary techniques have no proven benefit and may endanger patients via misdiagnosis.

REVIEW: Graham DM, Blaiss MS Complementary/Alternative Methods in the treatment of asthma Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2000;85:438-47 OBJECTIVE: This review will familiarize clinical allergists /immunologists with the common forms of complementary/alterna tive medicine (CAM) that are be ing used frequently by their patients. It reviews reasons that patients seek alternative health care therapies and the most common illnesses that are treated with this form of medicine. Cultural differences in CAM are also reviewed. The article focuses on specific therapies used to treat asthma and reviews the efficacy of these therapies based on the available scientific literature. The reader will also learn about views of other physicians on CAM and how this topic is being addressed in US medical schools. DATA SOURCES: Computer-assisted MEDLINE searches for articles and \"asthma\" or \"atopy.\" STUDY SE LECTION: Pertinent abstracts and articles in the above areas we re selected. Articles selected for detailed review included review articles of the subjects along with randomize d, double-blind placebo-controlled studies in animals and humans. RESULTS: Complementary/alternative medicine is commonly used by patients with chronic conditions including asthma . One-third of the US population has tried CAM. The literature supporting the efficacy of these therapies is lack ing. Some reports elucidate the mechanism of action of certain herbal therapie s that could possibly be helpful in the treatment of allergic diseases. There are, however, few well-controlled studies that support the efficacy of CAM in the treatment and clinical improve ment of human subjects with asthma or atopic disorders. CONCLUSION: Available scientific evidence does not support a role for CAM in the treatment of asthma. The studies in the literature often have significant design flaws that weaken the conclusions such as insufficient numbers of pati ents, lack of proper controls, and inadequate blinding. Further studies are needed to prove or disprove the efficacy of CAM. Physicians often find CAM intimidating because they are unaware of the clinical evidence and feel uncomfortable advising their patients on its efficacy. There is definitely a need for more education among physicians in this area. It is also important that physicians inquire and discuss the use of CAM with their patients since the majority of patients are using some form of CAM. 366 REVIEW: Ziment I, Tashkin DP. Alternativ e Medicine fo r allergy and asthma J Allergy Clin Immuno l. 2000 Oct;106(4):603-14 Orthodox medical approaches to asthma and alle rgic respiratory diseases are provided in guidelines developed by professiona l societies and nationa l or state organizations that represent organized medicine. Alternative therapies may include such orthodox medical therapies as obsolescent formerly used agents, unusual but accepted agents, and agents that are in favor for orthodox therapy in other countri es. However, the current gr owth of complementary and alternative medicine is based on the use of nonor thodox remedies that are becoming increasingly popular with patients and that should be familiar to physicians. Asthma and allergies are frequently treated with such remedies by patients, either as part of self-therapy or on the advice of a complementary and alternative medicine practi tioner. The most popular alternative medical treatments are herbs (Western and Asiatic), acupuncture, various types of body manipulation, psychologic therapies, homeopathy, a nd unusual allergy therapies. Ther e is little evidence in favor of most of these unorth odox treatments, although they are very often reported on favorably by patients. The published evidence that might support so me alternative medical practices is reviewed so as to help physicians select alternatives that coul d appropriately be integrated into orthodox practice.

The need to teach professionalism during residency has been affirmed by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, which will require documentation of education and evaluation of professionalism by 2007. Recently th e American Academy of Pediatrics has proposed the following components of professiona lism be taught and limits, communication/collaboration, and altruism/advocacy. The authors describe a curriculum for introducing the above pr inciples of professionalism into a pediatrics residency that could serve as a model for other programs. The curriculum is taught at an annual five-day retreat for interns, w ith 11 mandatory sessions devoted to addressing key professionalism issues. The authors also explain how the retreat is evaluated a nd how the retreat's topics are revisited during the residency, and discuss general issues of teaching and evaluating professionalism. B. Communication Skills COMPETENCY DEVELOPM ENT EXAMPLE: Egnew TR, Mauksch LB, Greer T, et al. Integrating communication training into a required family medicine clerkship. Acad Med 2004;79:737-43. Persistent evidence suggests that the communication skills of practicing phys icians do not achieve desired goals of enhancing patie nt satisfaction, strengthening h ealth outcomes and decreasing malpractice litigation. Stronger co mmunication skills training during the clinical ye ars of medical education might make use of an underutilized win dow of opportunity-student s' clinical years-to instill basic and important skills . The authors describe the implementation of a novel curriculum to teach patient-centered communication skills during a required third-year, six-week family medicine clerkship. Curriculum development and im plementation across 24 training sites in a five- state region are detailed. A faculty development e ffort and strategies for embedding the curriculum within a diverse collection of training sites are presented. Student and preceptor feedback are summarized and the lessons learned from the curr iculum development and implementation process are discussed. C. Practice Based Learning COMPETENCY DEVELOPM ENT EXAMPLE: Ogrinc G, Headrick LA, Mutha S, et al. A framework for teaching medical students a nd residents about practice-based learning and improvement, synthesized from a literature review. Acad Med 2005;78:748-56. PURPOSE: To create a framework for teaching the knowledge and skills of practice-based learning and improvement to medical students and residents based on proven, effective strategies. METHOD: The authors conducted a Medline search of English-language articles published between 1996 and May 2001, using the term \"quality improvement\" (QI), and crossmatched it with \"medical education\" and professions education.\" A thematic-synthesis method of review 368 369was used to compile the information from the arti cles. Based on the literature review, an expert panel recommended educational objectives fo r practice-based learning and improvement. RESULTS: Twenty-seven articles met the inclus ion criteria. The majority of studies were conducted in academic medical centers and medi cal schools and 40% addressed experiential learning of QI. More than 75% were quali tative case reports capturing educational outcomes, and 7% included an experimental stud y design. The expert panel integrated data from the literature review with th e Dreyfus model of professional skill acquisition, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's (IHI) knowledge domains for improving health care, and the ACGME competencies and generated a framework of core educational objectives about teaching practicebased learning and improvement to me dical students and resi dents. CONCLUSION: Teaching the knowledge and skills of practice- based learning and improvement to medical students and residents is a necessary and important foundation for improving patient care. The authors present a framework of l earning objectives-informed by the literature and synthesized by the expert panel-to assist educa tional leaders when integrating thes e objectives into a curriculum. This framework serves as a blueprint to bridge the gap between curren t knowledge and future practice needs. D. Systems-Based Practice COMPETENCY DEVELOPM ENT EXAMPLE: Tomolo A. Caron A, Perz ML.

Patient safety is a useful vehicle to facilitate learning about these interactions. AIM: Develop an educationa l tool, Outcomes Card (OC), to reinforce core concepts of SBP. SE TTING: Urgent Care Ce nter at Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Pilot study of an educational interventi on for residents that included patie nt safety didactic sessions and analysis of 2 self-identified clinical cases using the OC.
