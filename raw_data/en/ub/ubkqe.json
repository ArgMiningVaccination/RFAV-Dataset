It is an attractive option for patients who want to avoid surgery or have already undergone surgery but have not experienced relief. Prolotherapy is a technique used to treat musculoskeletal pain and injuries by injecting a solution into damaged or weakened connective tissues such as ligaments or tendons to promote the body's natural healing response. Ozone therapy, on the other hand, involves the therapeutic use of ozone gas to treat various medical conditions, including pain and inflammation. Prolozone injections are commonly used to treat a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis, joint pain, back pain, sports injuries, and fibromyalgia. It can also be used to treat conditions like herniated discs and carpal tunnel syndrome. Some of the benefits of Prolozone include: Reducing inflammation: Prolozone injections contain anti-inflammatory agents that help reduce inflammation and pain. Stimulating tissue regeneration: The mixture of vitamins, minerals, and ozone gas in Prolozone injections can stimulate the body's natural healing response, promoting tissue regeneration. Relieving pain: Prolozone injections can help reduce pain and discomfort caused by musculoskeletal conditions, which can improve mobility and quality of life. It is important to note that Prolozone therapy is a medical treatment that should only be performed by a qualified medical professional. Patients should consult with their doctor to determine if Prolozone is an appropriate treatment option for their specific condition. ________________________________________________________________________________________________ High Dose [Ozone Therapy](https://rmrm.com/high-dose-ozone-therapy-hdot/) (HDOT) has a number of beneficial biological effects that can be harnessed both for health optimization and for treating a wide range of disease states. For example, ozone is a hormetic stress on the body and as such, it triggers a number of important, healthy adaptive changes with each exposure. Ozone is also a direct antimicrobial and augments activity of the immune system against bacteria, viruses, and fungi including mold. Another way ozone therapy helps the immune system is by modulating its activity and keeping it in a homeostatic state, thus helping address some autoimmune conditions. Finally, ozone works through nitric oxide to improve circulation and tissue oxygenation. A very important point to keep in mind is that there are several forms of HDOT, with some more grounded in fact than others. To avoid wasting time and resources, it's essential to work with a physician who has years of experience, has treated a multitude of conditions, and has invested in state of the art equipment. What to expect: This therapy typically takes 1-1 1/2 hours. An IV is placed for the treatment which is used to facilitate ozonation of the blood once the treatment is complete the IV is removed and people continue on with their day. Only precaution that is notable is that a blood thinner is used for this treatment and activities afterward should take this into account (i.e. no contact sports or activities that are high risk for trauma/head [injury](https://rmrm.com/leonard-buck-wessel-us-olympic-judo-team-lead/) for 3-4 hours after the treatment).
