VulvoVaginal Atrophy, or \"VVA\" for short, is also called genitourinary syndrome of menopause. VVA is a condition where the skin of the vagina and vulva becomes thin, dry and irritated. Before menopause, your ovaries produce a hormone called estrogen that keeps the skin of the genitals healthy and producing its own moisture. VV A happens when yo ur ovaries stop releasing estrogen. VVA symptoms include: Vaginal dryness Pain during intercourse or other penetrative sex play Itching or burning of the skin of the vulva or vagina Swelling and/or redness of the skin of the vulva or vagina Brown or yellow discharge from the vagina VVA can mean that you are uncomfortable in your day -to-day life. It also can mean that sex is uncomfort able or painful , and sometimes impossible. This is especially true when sex involves putting something in the vagina. What Causes VVA? After me nopause, your body produces less estrogen than before. Menopause can occur naturally with age or can be caused by surg ery or some cancer treatments. Some c ancer survivors - most notably breast cancer - may also be treated with drugs that suppress estrogen's effect in the body. Some kinds of birth control pills can also cause VVA. Cigarette smoking may cause women t o go thro ugh menopause earlier than usual, so these symptoms happen at a younger age. Estrogen promotes healthy blood flow to the small blood vessels in your vulva and vagina. When estrogen levels go down, the lack of blood flow causes VVA symptoms. How Do I Manage VVA? There are a variety of ways to address VVA. Keep yourself healthy, avoid irritants to the vulva and vagina, and use moisturizers and lubricants. 1. Healthy lifestyle choices daily exercise of 30 -60 minutes to promote healthy blood flow no smoking; smoking damages blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the small blood vessels in the vulva and vagina a diet that includes: 1) Healthy oils such as olive oil, tree nuts and seeds. 2) Lean meats, fatty fish and at least 5 servings per day of v egetables and fruits. 3) Few sweets and processed foods. 2. Vaginal moisturizers Vaginal moisturizers can be used daily or several times a week, whether you are planning on having sex or not. They will help moisturize the lining of the vagina, make the tissues more pliable, and may sooth itching and irritation. Moisturizers can help increase your comfort during day -to-day acti vities. While there are many on the market, some moisturizers have ingredients that may cause problems.

You should always test a lubricant on your skin before you use it in your vagina. To test a lubricant or moisturizer before you use it, dab a little bit on the insid e of your wrist or elbow. The skin is thin in these places, similar to the skin in your vagina. If your skin looks OK after 24 hours, the product should be safe to use. If it itches, or looks pink or red, try a product with different ingredients. 3. Intimate lubrican ts Lubricants are designed to prevent dryness during sex.

Are there prescription medications available ? VVA can be effectively treated with estrogen therapy, either orally or topically on the vaginal and vulvar tissues. It is thought that topical application is more effective in treating VVA than taking pills. However, there are some types of cancers that can be encouraged to grow by t he presence of estrogen, such as some breast and uterine cancer s. If you have symptoms that are very bothersome to you, sometimes very low doses of topical estrogen can be used for short periods of time to help control symptoms. If you have had a n estrogen -sensitive cancer , please talk to your oncology team before starting any kind of estrogen therapy. 1. Topical or local estrogen by prescription You can apply some types of estrogen directly to your vulva and vagina to help restore the blood flow to t hose tissues. The dose is low, and very little is absorbed into the rest of your body, which leads to a low risk of side effects . You should still ask your health care provider about side effect s. Local estrogen therapy comes in the following forms: Topical c ream or ointment. Some women are sensitive to ingredients in the cream. If you have access to a compounding pharmacy, estrogen can be mixed into a neutral oin tment base instead. This may help with some sensitivities. A \"tablet\" that is inserted into th e vagina twice a week. The brand name for this is Vagifem. A ring that is placed in the vagina . Estrogen comes out of the ring into the vagina. The brand name for this is Estring. 2. Another kind of prescription pill There is a pill approved by the FDA fo r VVA that you take by mouth once every day. The brand name for th is is Osphena, or ospemifene. It can improve the symptoms of VVA. While this is a simple solution, this m edicine can cause hot flashes or other side effects. There is no safety data availa ble for women who have had estrogen -sensitive cancer s. If you are interested in this option, please talk to your health care provider . Painful sex that is not caused by VulvoVaginal Atrophy Many postmenopausal women also have a gradual tightening of the muscles that are around the opening of the vagina. This tightening with vaginal dryness and fragile, irritated skin, makes penetrative sex more painful and difficult. It may still hurt even when using a lubricant, moisturizer, topical estrogen, or all three. This feels like there is a tight band about an inch inside the opening of the vagina. Some people describe it as feeling like their partner hits a wall when trying to start intercourse. It is important to stop trying to have intercourse when this happens until you get treatment. This is especially true if it hurts. Pain during sex can cause a very painful condition where the pelvic floor muscles spasm at the opening of the vagina. If you have these symptoms, you can request a referral for pelvic floor therapy from your health care provider. A pelvic floor therapist will do an evaluation to determine the cause of your discomfort. She may give you exercises to do to learn how to relax th ose muscles and keep them flexible enough to enjoy penetration again. Congratulations on talking to your health care provider about these concerns. You deserve to have pleasurable, comfortable intimacy.
