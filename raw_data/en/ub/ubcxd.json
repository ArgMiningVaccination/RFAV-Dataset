Acupuncture is the insertion of fine, sterile needles into acupoints located throughout the body. These points are located along meridians where the energy of the body flows. Upon insertion one may experience a surge of energy or an achy dull sensation. This is known as Qi (chee) or life giving force. An acupuncturist uses the needles to get the qi and encourage healing. Acupuncture is a safe and effective form of health care. Is Acupuncture Painful? No. The needles used in an acupuncture treatment are hair - thin and are for the most part painless. The patient will usually experience an unusual sensation at the site of insertion, like a surge of energy or an electrical flux. This surge is known as obtaining the Qi or \"life force\" and is a positive sign. Most patients that have acupuncture in Denver experience a great sense of calm and relaxation during and after an acupuncture [treatment](/schedule-appointment/). What Happens In a Treatment? A treatment includes a look at the patients health history, an acupuncture session, herbal, dietary and lifestyle recommendations. Each treatment will vary according to how ones body is changing throughout the healing process. The practitioner will look at the patient's tongue and feel the pulse in order to diagnose the condition and create a treatment plan. How Long Will I Need Treatments? Treatment protocols are created specifically for individuals. No one person is alike and disharmonies within the body manifest differently for everyone. The brilliance in Chinese Medicine is in its ability to tailor treatment protocols to individuals. Chronic conditions tend to take longer than acute ones. For the most part, noticeable differences take place after three to five treatments.
