You can try a vaginal moisturiser to help with vaginal dryness.1 Using a vaginal moisturiser can help you lock in moisture in and around the vagina and aid in dealing with vaginal dryness. These moisturisers are usually of two types, internal and external. Internal moisturisers are inserted inside a vagina. External vaginal moisturisers are used for the vulva (the outer part of the female genitals).8 You may use any water-based lubricant before intercourse to get rid of vaginal dryness. These lubricants might provide short-term moisturisation.1,3 Lubricants might be applied in and around the vagina or on your partner's penis to avoid any discomfort during sex and help get rid of vaginal dryness.3 Check out - [Kamasutra Aloe Vera Water Based Lubricant](https://pharmeasy.in/health-care/products/kamasutra-aloe-vera-water-based-lubricant-bottle-of-50-ml-212804) Vaginal moisture during sex depends on arousal. Before indulging in sexual intercourse, try more extended foreplay. Enjoying more foreplay could help you get more aroused during sex and help prevent vaginal dryness. Bartholin's gland present at the entrance of the vagina produce moisture during sexual arousal.2,3 Avoid using heavily perfumed soap, cleanser or lotion in and around your vagina. These chemicals can cause irritation and lead to dryness of your vagina. Always use perfumes-free soaps and lotions for your vagina. Using perfumed soaps, douches, or cleansers for your vagina is one of the factors responsible for causing vaginal dryness.3 Though there are studies that show the benefits of the given home remedies in dealing with vaginal dryness, these are insufficient. There is a need for large-scale human studies to establish the true extent of the benefits of these home remedies on human health. Thus, these should only be taken with caution and never as a substitute for medical treatment.
