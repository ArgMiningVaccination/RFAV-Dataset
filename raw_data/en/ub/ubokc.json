Multiple biofilm -specific mechanisms , poor antibiotic pene- tration, nutrient limitation, slow growth, adaptive stress re- sponses, and formation of persister cells contribute to the high levels of antibiotic resistance . Therefore, P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated infections, such as those common in cystic fibrosis and burn patients, present huge clinical challenges which have spurred interest in the development of novel drugs and drug delivery strategies to treat these infections. To screen new drugs for efficacy against biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa , we optimized a microtiter - based protocol described by Kwasny and Opperman. This methodology was selected because few steps are required , making it ideal as a primary screen for drug ca ndidates with activity against biofilms . In addition, two commonly used methods of biofilm measurement were evaluated to determine which of these should be included as part of an optimized process to identify biofilm inhibitors . Materials and Methods Strains : The following strains of P. aeruginosa were chosen for optimization of culture conditions. PA01 - a widely studied strain, the genome of which has been sequenced PA607 7 - a toxin producing strain ATCC 27853 - a strain commonly used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing Media for Biofilm Formation : Media formulations used were based on Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) supple- mented with 0.2% glucose ( LB) Broth supplemented with 2% glucose. Culture Conditions : Cultures were grown overnight at 37 \u00b0C under aerobic conditions . Overnight cultures were diluted in assay media , and 100 L was transferred to the wells of a 96-well tissue -culture coated polystyrene flat -bottomed plate . For each strai n and medium, eight wells were inoculated. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C without agitation (static culture). Each plate included medium -only control wells.

B io- films were fixed by incubating the plates at 60\u00b0C for 1 hour. Two methods were used to measure biofilm formation: Crystal Violet 1 ( CV1): Biofilm formatio n was evaluated by adding 200 \u00b5L of 30% acetic acid to each well after staining with 50 L of a 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet solution and then measuring the OD 600 of the eluate. Eluates with an optical density > 2.5 were diluted 1:10 in a solution of 30% acetic acid. Crystal Violet 2 ( CV2): Biofilm formation was evaluated by adding 200 \u00b5L of 70% ethanol to each well after staining with 50 L of a 0.4% (w/v) crystal violet solution and then measuring the OD 600 of the eluate. Eluates with an optical density > 2.5 were diluted 1:10 in a solution of 70% ethanol . Evaluation of Cell Viability in L of phenazine methosulfate at 0. 34 mg/mL were added to each well. Cultures were incubated for 2 hours and the absorbance at 450 nm was determined . B ackground absorbance was measured at 650 nm and then subtract- ed from absorbance at 450 nm to obtain normalized absorbance values. Results Effect of Culture Media Figure 1 depict s the effect s of three different culture medi a on biofilm formation by three strains of P. aeruginosa . Cultures were initi- ated with an inoculum of 1 x 106 CFU/mL. The results were similar for all media evalu- ated , although biofilm formation was slightly lower with cells grown in BHI broth than cells grown in LB + 2% glucose or TSB + 0.2% glu- cose . Biofilm formation by each of the three strains increased and reached a plateau be- tween 8 and 16 hours of incubation. A de- crease in biofilm mass was observed for two of the three strains after 16 hours. Results in Figure 1 were obtained with the CV2 method but the pattern was similar to that obtained using the CV1 method. For a comparison of CV1 vs CV2 see Figure 4. www.imquestbio.com 301.696.0274 info@imquestbio.com TSB + 0.2% glucose was selected for protocol optimization because it is a commonly used medium for the cultivation of aerobic microbes like pseudomonads , is used for inoculum preparation prior to antibi- otic sensitivity testing, and has been reported to support biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa . Effect of Inoculum Concentration The effect of inoculum concentration on biofilm formation in TSB + 0.2% gluc ose (Figure 2) as well as BHI and LB + 2% glu- cose (data not shown) was determined for three strains of P. aer uginosa . Biofilm for- mation was measured using the CV2 meth- od. Biofilm formation over time was a function of inoculum - at higher concentrations of bacteria a biomass plateau was reached more quickly . With an inoculum of 1 x 108 CFU/mL, bio- film formation reached maximum levels after 4 to 6 hours of incubation. At 1 x 106 and 1 x 107 CFU/mL, biofilm formation reach ed maximum levels at 6 to 8 hours with the exception of P. aeruginosa strain 6077 inoculated at 1 x 106 CFU/mL which reached a maximum at 16 hours . Biofilm formation with an inoculum of 1 x 105 CFU/m L generally increased during the ear- ly hours and reached maximum levels be- tween 8 and 16 hours. An inoculum of 1 x 106 CFU/mL was select- ed as the starting inoculum concentration for protocol optimization because biofilm formation steadily increase s and reach es maxim al or near maxim al biomass levels within 8 hour s. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis patients are predisposed to P. aeruginosa infection of the lungs. Among those CF patients age 18 and older, about 80% are infected with P. aeruginosa , and about 18% of these patients are infected with a multidrug -resistant strain of P. aeru- ginosa .

Staining with the tetrazolium dye, XTT, demonstrated a high percentage of viable cells in biofilms and correlated with bio mass formation. Viability increased during the first 8 to 16 hours of incubation. During this time, bio- mass formation also increased. Some de- crease in viability was observed betw een 16 and 24 hours of culture. Similar results were obtained with BHI and LB + 2% glucose inoc u- lated at x 106 CFU/mL (data not shown). Pseudomonas aeruginosa Nosocomial Infections According to the CDC, an estimated 51,000 healthcare -associated P. aeruginosa infec- tions occur in the United States each year. More than 6,000 (13%) of these are multi- drug -resistant, with roughly 400 deaths per year attributed to these infections. Patients in hospitals, especially those on ventilators , those with devices such as catheters, and patients with wounds from surgery or from burns are potentially at risk for serious, life -threatening infections caused by P. aeruginosa .

Whether the CV1 or the CV2 method was used to measure biofilm form ation, biofilm biomass increased over 8 to 16 hours . However, the biofilm level was generally higher with the CV2 method. Similar results were obtained when the st rains were grown in BHI broth or LB + 2% glucose (data not shown) . The CV2 method was selected for use in the optimized protocol because it may have re- sulted in a more complete extraction of crystal violet than CV1. Conclusions We report herein the optimization of the Kwasny and Opperman protocol for biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa . The results demonstrate th at all three medi a used sup- port robust biofilm formation and that cells in the biofilm were viable . With an inoculum lev- el of 1 x 106 CFU/mL, biofilm formation gener- ally reaches maximum levels within 8 hours, thereby providing a one -day time frame for a rapid screening biofilm inhibition assay . The results also demonstrate that cell viability generally correlates with biofilm biomass for- mation and that the CV2 method of biofilm measurement is probably more suitable than the CV1 method . In summary, the protocol optimized by ImQuest BioSciences provides a high throughput procedure to screen drug candidates for activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms and is especially suitable to rapidly identify highly active inhibitors of biofilm formation .
