No fever, coryza, or conjunctivitis reported. No travel history or known exposures Started on 10- day course of amoxicillin Developed full -body rash 1 week later. Concern for possible measles. Measles swab done, PCR POSITIVE Thoughts...?? Additional history: vaccine 9 days prior to measles testingPost- MMR rash Fever and rash occur in approx 5% of MMR vaccine recipients, usually 6 -12 days after vaccination; can be clinically identical to measles infection and cause positive measles test, not infectious If a recently vaccinated patient has fever and rash but no risk factors for measles, testing is usually unnecessary Drug eruption Delayed (nonimmediate) reactions usually appear after more than one dose of drug and typically after days of treatment. For example, delayed cutaneous maculopapular eruptions to amoxicillin classically start on day 7 to 10 of treatment and may even begin 1 to 3 days after cessation of treatmentCommon: diarrhea, otitis media, pneumonia, tracheobronchitis Serious: 1/1000 encephalitis die; subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (rare but fatal CNS deterioration 7 -10 years after infection) Increased risk: kids < 5, adults >20, pregnant women, immunocompromised REPORT suspected cases to SOE ASAP!

Serology for measles IgM (NOT IgG) 3. Minimum 50 mL urine in clean/sterile leak- proof container for PCR Collect from first part of urine stream, first morning void is ideal Available on the AK DHSS Measles webpageMeasles is one of the most highly contagious infectious diseases 9/10 susceptible persons with close contact will get infected Period of contagion: 4 days before rash onset to 4 days after rash appears Route: airborne (breath, cough, sneeze), direct contact with infectious droplets Virus can remain in the air for up to 2 hours after infected person leaves the areaIsolation at home: for 4 days after rash onset Let family know that PH nurse will be calling them Consider post -exposure prophylaxis for contacts Healthcare settings Prepare triage stations to rapidly identify pts with measles Plan ahead; if suspicion of measles, provide pt with instructions for arrival (end of day, entrance, precautions, staff) Isolate pt and family immediately upon arrival; meet them outside, place mask , AIIR room, avoid contact with other patients/staff If AIIR room not available: mask pt, private room with door closed, transfer as soon as possible to facility with AIIR Do not send ptto a lab for testing; if you do not have supplies available; call SOE If transferring to another facility, call ahead to notify them to prepare Assess family members for vaccination status and any sx All HCP (regardless of immunity) should use N95 mask Non- immune HCP should avoid entering the room Room should not be used for 2 hours after ptleaves; standard cleaning and disinfection procedures Airborne precautions (or home isolation) for 4 days after rash onset (or duration of illness in immunocompromised) At least one of the following: Written documentation of adequate vaccination 1 dose on or after 1stbirthday for preschool -age kids and adults not at high risk 2 doses for school -age kids and adults at high risk (college students, international travelers, HCP ) Laboratory evidence of immunity Laboratory confirmation of measles infection Birth before 1957Should be offered to people exposed to measles who cannot readily show evidence of immunity Administer MMR vaccine within 72 hours of initial exposure OR (MMR can be used in infants as young as 6 mos of age in this situation) IG within 6 days of exposure Should be offered to those at risk for severe illness and complications from measles Infants under 12 mos (6-11 mos can be given MMR instead if within 72 -hour window) Pregnant women Severe -measles -algorithm -people -exposed.pdfRoutine 2 -15 mos Dose #2: 4 -6 years or at least 28 days after 1stdose Adults born 1957 or later with no evidence of immunity: 1 dose Students at post -high school educational institutions 2 doses 28 days apart if no evidence of immunity International travelers: 6-11 mos: 1 dose 12 mos or older: 2 doses Teens/adults born 1957 or later: 2 doses HCP: need 2 doses or other evidence of immunity 1 dose provides 93% immunity; 2 doses 97% immunity; considered to be lifelong 95% vaccination rate needed for herd immunity Consult with local health department on latest recs Consider 2nddose for kids 1 -4 and adults in outbreak areas Recommend (vs. consider) 2 doses for HCP if no documented immunity even if born before 1957 Consider early dose for infants 6 -11 mos residing in or visiting outbreak areaMyth: Measles is a harmless disease Truth: Measles is a serious disease with possible short -and long- term complications. Vaccination is the only effective way to protect against it . Myth: It is better to get immunity by getting the disease than by receiving the vaccine. Truth: Vaccines provide protection against measles without the development of severe sx, complications, or sequelae. Severe adverse events following MMR vaccination are very rare. Vaccination is the best and safest way to get immunity against measles. Myth: Homeopathy can be used as an alternative to vaccinations to protect children against measles. Truth: Homeopathy has been shown to be ineffective. Vaccination is the only effective way to protect against measles. Adapted from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/measles/prevention -and-control/addressing -misconceptions -measles ) Myth: Giving a child the MMR combination vaccine increases the risk of harmful side effects and can overload the immune system. Truth: The myth that combination vaccines overload the immune system underestimates the power of the human immune system and overestimates the number of foreign substances in combination vaccines. The combination formula has an excellent safety record over many years. Myth: MMR vaccination may cause autism. Truth: A scientifically flawed journal article wrongly caused fears that the MMR vaccine may lead to autism but numerous scientific studies refute this claim and show that no such relationship exists. Myth: Measles has been largely eliminated in the U.S. and there is no reason to be vaccinated. Truth: Measles is still a threat in the U.S. Only with 95% vaccine coverage can measles be successfully controlled.
