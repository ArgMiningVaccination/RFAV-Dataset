Leave half of an inch at the top of the jar. Cover the jar tightly. [[1]](#_note-1)X Research source - Pickling or preserving jars work very well for making your own herbal oil. - Dried herbs work best because they do not contain water that can cause mold. If you don't use dried herbs, let them wilt for about 12 hours, then crush them with a mortar and pestle before putting in the oil. - Choose an herb-based on how you intend to use the finished herbal oil. For example, you can [use neem oil](/Use-Neem-Oil)as a natural insecticide or dandruff treatment. - 2Allow the oil to set. Place the jar on a shelf where it gets plenty of sunlight during the day.

[[2]](#_note-2)X Research source Advertisement - Let it sit on the sunny shelf for two more days. Mix it by inversion twice a day. - 3Filter the oil. After it has set for 16 days, the mixture is ready to pour out and use. Don't use the oil straight from the jar. You need to filter it first. Pour the oil through a cheesecloth into a new clean glass, lidded jar. This catches all of the herbs, leaving you with just herbs. [[3]](#_note-3)X Research source - Store the jar in a cool, dry, and dark place. - If you want a stronger oil, add the new herb to the already-infused oil and repeat the process once more.
