It was even found in the tomb of the Egyptian King Tutankhamun. In line with this, several studies have outlined the positive effects of cilantro in removing heavy metals. A November 2009 study published in Biological Trace Element Research noted that cilantro [significantly decreased oxidative stress](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12011-009-8553-0) triggered by lead exposure. The authors of this paper found that serum testosterone levels and sperm density were suppressed in mice exposed to the heavy metal. Daily administration of cilantro extracts reversed this damage. Meanwhile, a 1995 study published in Acupuncture & Electro-therapeutics Research noted that cilantro [accelerated the removal of heavy metals](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/cog/aetr/1995/00000020/f0020003/art00005;jsessionid=h2kamm2bdobb4.x-ic-live-02) - mercury, lead and aluminum - from the body through urine. The study authors pointed out that the presence of these metals prevented antibiotics from working properly against infections. Despite the unappealing taste of cilantro, it improved the effectiveness of antibiotics in reducing pathogens.

A 2019 article by the Times of India said cilantro's detoxifying properties [work best with chlorella](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/cilantro-can-remove-most-of-heavy-metals-from-your-body-in-less-than-2-months/photostory/68285600.cms?picid=68285614), a nutritious green algae commonly consumed as a supplement. It suggested taking chlorella and cilantro thrice a day for up to three months. Various studies cited by the outlet said the combination of cilantro and chlorella can naturally remove an average of 91 percent of mercury, 87 percent of lead and 74 percent of aluminum from the body within 45 days. Cilantro is more than just an herb that [removes heavy metals and toxins](http://detox.news) from the body. Other studies have cited its other positive effects when included in the diet. A study published in Skin Pharmacology and Physiology noted how [cilantro protected skin cells](https://karger.com/spp/article-abstract/25/2/93/295709/Coriandrum-sativum-L-Protects-Human-Keratinocytes) by increasing the levels of glutathione and activating other enzymes involved in antioxidant defense. Moreover, the study authors found that cilantro increased the expression of activated Nrf2, which binds to antioxidants and protects skin cells from oxidative stress. A study published in the Journal of Food Science expounded on the effects of cilantro [against high blood sugar and high cholesterol](https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2012.02755.x). The study found that diabetic rats given cilantro extract had lower blood glucose levels, comparable with the effects of the anti-diabetes drug, glibenclamide. The researchers also found that \"the levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower\" in rats given cilantro extract. Cilantro can also be of much benefit to the mind, according to a paper published in the Indian Journal of Pharmacology. It showed that cilantro extract [can produce the same anti-anxiety effect](https://www.ijp-online.com/article.asp?issn=0253-7613;year=2011;volume=43;issue=5;spage=574;epage=577;aulast=Mahendra) as the drug diazepam, sold under the name Valium. However, cilantro extract was found to mimic the effects of diazepam without the negative side effects - such as agitation, aggression, confusion, hallucinations, memory problems, muscle weakness and risk-taking behavior. Known throughout parts of Europe and India as a healing plant, a small amount of cilantro delivers the full daily value of vitamins A, C, E, K, calcium, iron, magnesium and potassium. Spicy dishes such as curries can be better tolerated with a simple addition of freshly chopped cilantro. Head over to [Herbs.news](https://herbs.news/) for more stories about cilantro.
