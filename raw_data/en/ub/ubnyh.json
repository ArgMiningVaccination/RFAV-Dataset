Hydronephrosis can be accurately detected using point-of-care ultrasound and is a key predictor of ureteral stone and risk of subsequent complications. The absence of hydronephrosis is insufficient to exclude a stone. We created a sensitive clinical decision rule to predict clinically important ureteral stones. We hypothesized that this rule could identify patients at low risk for this outcome. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a random sample of 4000 adults who presented to one of 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California EDs and underwent a CT for suspected ureteral stone from 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2020. The primary outcome was clinically important stone, defined as stone resulting in hospitalization or urologic procedure within 60 days. We used recursive partition analysis to generate a clinical decision rule predicting the outcome. We estimated the C-statistic (area under the curve), plotted the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the model, and calculated sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the model based on a risk threshold of 2%. Among 4000 patients, 354 (8.9%) had a clinically important stone. Our partition model resulted in four terminal nodes with risks ranging from 0.4% to 21.8%. The area under the ROC curve was 0.81 (95% CI 0.80, 0.83). Using a 2% risk cut point, a clinical decision tree including hydronephrosis, hematuria, and a history of prior stones predicted complicated stones with sensitivity 95.5% (95% CI 92.8%-97.4%), specificity 59.9% and negative predictive value 99.3% (95% CI 98.8%-99.6%). Application of this clinical decision rule to imaging decisions would have led to 63% fewer CT scans with a miss rate of 0.4%. A limitation was the application of our decision rule only to patients who underwent CT for suspected ureteral stone. Thus, this rule would not apply to patients who were thought to have ureteral colic but did not receive a CT because ultrasound or history were sufficient for diagnosis. These results could inform future prospective validation studies. Authors: J Emerg Med. 2023 May;67:168-175. Epub 2023-02-24. Association of Surgical Timing with Outcomes in Early Stage Lung Cancer Optimal time to surgery for lung cancer is not well established. We aimed to assess whether time to surgery correlates with outcomes. We assessed patients 18-84 years old who were diagnosed with stage I/II lung cancer at our integrated healthcare system from 2009 to 2019. Time to surgery was defined to start with disease confirmation (imaging or biopsy) prior to the surgery scheduling date. Outcomes of unplanned return to care within 30 days of lung cancer surgery, all-cause mortality, and disease recurrence were compared based on time to surgery before and after 2, 4, and 12 weeks. Of 2861 included patients, 70% were over 65 years old and 61% were female. Time to surgery occurred in 1-2 weeks for 6%, 3-4 weeks for 31%, 5-12 weeks for 58%, and 13-26 weeks for 5% of patients. Patients with time to surgery > 4 (vs. 4) weeks had greater risk of both death (hazard ratio (HR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.39) and recurrence (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10-1.62). Associations were not statistically significant when dichotomizing time to surgery at 2 or 12 weeks for death (2 week HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.93-1.64; 12 week HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.97-1.88) and recurrence (2 week HR 1.54, 95% CI 0.85-2.80; 12 week HR 2.28, 95% CI 0.80-6.46). Early stage lung cancer patients with time to surgery within 4 weeks experienced lower rates of recurrence. Optimal time to surgical resection may be shorter than previously reported.

Cannabis use for medical reasons among patients in a large California health care system after legalization of non-medical use In 2018, California legalized the sale of cannabis for adult non-medical use. To understand use of cannabis after legalization, we surveyed a stratified random sample of adults in a large health system (aged 19-64) with and without documented chronic pain (CP) about their reasons for cannabis use from November 2018 to March 2019. We compared patients with and without CP on measures for medical, non-medical, pain-related, and mental health-related cannabis use based on self-reported symptoms. Patients with CP reported higher past year medical use (34.6%) compared to patients without CP (22.8%), past year pain-related use (29.7% vs 15.5%), and past year mental health-related use (24.8% vs 18.9%). In adjusted models, relative to patients without CP, those with CP had a 6.2% (95% CI: 0.010-0.11) higher probability of use and an 8.0% (95% CI: 0.035-0.13) higher probability of past year pain-related cannabis use. Compared to patients without CP, patients with CP were more likely to use cannabis for reasons related to medical and pain symptoms in the past year. Use for past year mental health symptoms did not differ between these two groups. Cannabis use among patients with and without CP is common after legalization for non-medical use and understanding reasons for use is important to improve overall patient care.

Social Risks, Social Needs, and Attitudes Toward Social Health Screening 1 Year Into the COVID-19 Pandemic: Survey of Adults in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System Introduction Information about demographic differences in social risks, needs, and attitudes toward social health screening in non-highly vulnerable adult populations is lacking. Methods The authors analyzed data for 2869 Kaiser Permanente Northern California non-Medicaid-covered members aged 35 to 85 who responded to a 2021 English-only mailed/online survey. The survey covered 7 social risk and 11 social needs domains and attitudes toward social health screening. The authors used data weighted to the Kaiser Permanente Northern California membership to estimate prevalence of risks, needs, and screening receptivity in the overall population, by race/ethnicity (White, Black, Latinx, Asian American/Pacific Islander) and age (35-65 years old, 66-85 years old). Multivariable regression was used to evaluate differences between groups. Results Overall, 26% of adults were financially strained, 12% food insecure, 12% housing insecure, and 5% transportation insecure. Additionally, 7%, 8%, and 17% had difficulty paying for utilities, medical expenses, and dental care, respectively. Over 40% of adults wanted help with 1 social need. Dental care, vision/hearing care, paying for medical expenses and utilities, and managing debt/credit card repayment surpassed food, housing, and transportation needs. Prevalence of social risks and needs was generally higher among middle-aged versus older and Black and Latinx versus White adults. Among the 70% of adults receptive to screening, 85% were willing to complete a questionnaire and 40% were willing to have staff ask questions; 18% did not want to be screened. Conclusion When implementing social health screening in diverse patient populations, the prevalence of social risks and needs, as well as the acceptability of social health screening and screening modalities, will vary among demographic subgroups.

Glycemic Control Over Multiple Decades and Dementia Risk in People With Type 2 Diabetes The levels of glycemic control associated with the lowest risk of dementia in people with type 2 diabetes are unknown. This knowledge is critical to inform patient-centered glycemic target setting. To examine the associations between cumulative exposure to various ranges of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations with dementia risk across sex and racial and ethnic groups and the association of current therapeutic glycemic targets with dementia risk. This cohort study included members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated health care system with type 2 diabetes who were aged 50 years or older during the study period from January 1, 1996, to September 30, 2015. Individuals with fewer than 2 HbA1c measurements during the study period, prevalent dementia at baseline, or less than 3 years of follow-up were excluded. Data were analyzed from February 2020 to January 2023. Time-updated cumulative exposure to HbA1c thresholds. At each HbA1c measurement, participants were categorized based on the percentage of their HbA1c measurements that fell into the following categories: less than 6%, 6% to less than 7%, 7% less than 8%, 8% to less than 9%, 9% to less than 10%, and 10% or more of total hemoglobin (to convert percentage of total hemoglobin to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01). Dementia diagnosis was identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes from inpatient and outpatient encounters. Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated the association of time-varying cumulative glycemic exposure with dementia, adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, baseline health conditions, and number of HbA1c measurements. A total of 253 211 participants were included. The mean (SD) age of participants was 61.5 (9.4) years, and 53.1% were men. The mean (SD) duration of follow-up was 5.9 (4.5) years. Participants with more than 50% of HbA1c measurements at 9% to less than 10% or 10% or more had greater risk of dementia compared with those who had 50% or less of measurements in those categories (HbA1c 9% to <10%: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.15-1.51]; HbA1c10%: aHR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.62-1.86]). By contrast, participants with more than 50% of HbA1c concentrations less than 6%, 6% to less than 7%, or 7% to less than 8% had lower risk dementia aHR, CI, 0.89-0.97]). In this study dementia risk was greatest among adults with cumulative HbA1c concentrations of 9% or more. These results support currently recommended relaxed glycemic targets for older people with type 2 diabetes. Authors: Moran, Chris; Lacy, Mary 2023 Apr 17. Bilateral Emboli and Highest Heart Rate Predict Hospitalization of Emergency Department Patients With Acute, Low-Risk Pulmonary Embolism Some patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) will suffer adverse clinical outcomes despite being low risk by clinical decision rules. Emergency physician decisionmaking processes regarding which low-risk patients require hospitalization are unclear. Higher heart rate (HR) or embolic burden may increase short-term mortality risk, and we hypothesized that these variables would be associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalization for patients designated as low risk by the PE Severity Index. This was a retrospective cohort study of 461 adult emergency department (ED) patients with a PE Severity Index score of fewer than 86 points. Primary exposures were the highest observed ED HR, most proximal embolus location (proximal vs distal), and embolism laterality (bilateral vs unilateral PE). The primary outcome was hospitalization. Of 461 patients meeting inclusion criteria, most (57.5%) were hospitalized, 2 patients (0.4%) died within 30 days, and 142 (30.8%) patients were at elevated risk by other criteria (Hestia criteria or biochemical/radiographic right ventricular dysfunction). Variablesassociated with an increased likelihood of admission were highest observed ED HR of 110 beats/minute (vs HR <90 beats/min) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07 to 9.57), highest HR 90 to 109 1.18-3.50) to 3.27). Proximal embolus location was not associated with the likelihood of hospitalization (aOR 1.19; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.00). Most patients were hospitalized, often with recognizable high-risk characteristics not accounted for by the PE Severity Index. Highest ED HR of 90 beats/min and bilateral PE were associated with a physician's decision David R Ann Emerg Med. 2023 Apr 05.

Effects of COVID-19 shelter-in-place confinement on diabetes prevention health behaviors among US adults with prediabetes: A cross-sectional survey The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in significant lifestyle changes due to shelter-in-place confinement orders. The study's purpose was to assess if the COVID-19 pandemic affected self-reported diabetes prevention behaviors among American adults with prediabetes. As part of a randomized clinical trial among adults with prediabetes and overweight/obesity, questions were added to existing study surveys to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on diabetes prevention behaviors and stress. Survey responses were summarized using frequencies. 259 study participants completed seven COVID-19 survey questions from June 2020 to June 2021. Participants were 62.9% female, 42.5% White, 31.3% Black, 11.6% Asian, 8.1% Hispanic, and 6.6% Other. Over 75% of participants reported that the COVID-19 pandemic affected physical activity levels, with 82.1% of those affected reporting decreased physical activity; 70.3% reported that the pandemic affected their eating habits, with 61.7% of those affected reporting their eating habits became less healthy; 73.7% reported that the pandemic affected their level of stress, with 97.4% of those affected reporting that their level of stress had increased; 60% reported that the pandemic affected their motivation to adopt/maintain healthy habits, with 72.9% of those affected reporting their motivation decreased. A high percentage of study participants with prediabetes reported decreases in health promotion behaviors and increases in stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, the pandemic could lead to increased diabetes incidence. Strategies to improve diabetes prevention behaviors and address mental health concerns among those at-risk for diabetes are critical during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Clinical decision support to Optimize Care of patients with Atrial Fibrillation or flutter in the Emergency department: protocol of a stepped-wedge cluster randomized pragmatic trial (O'CAF\u00c9 trial) Management of adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter in the emergency department (ED) includes rate reduction, cardioversion, and stroke prevention. Different approaches to these components of care may lead to variation in frequency of hospitalization and stroke prevention actions, with significant implications for patient experience, cost of care, and risk of complications. Standardization using evidence-based recommendations could reduce variation in management, preventable hospitalizations, and stroke risk. We describe the rationale for our ED-based AF treatment recommendations. We also describe the development of an electronic clinical decision support system (CDSS) to deliver these recommendations to emergency physicians at the point of care. We implemented the CDSS at three pilot sites to assess feasibility and solicit user feedback. We will evaluate the impact of the CDSS on hospitalization and stroke prevention actions using a stepped-wedge cluster randomized pragmatic clinical trial across 13 community EDs in Northern California. We hypothesize that the CDSS intervention will reduce hospitalization of adults with isolated AF or atrial flutter presenting to the ED and increase anticoagulation prescription in eligible patients at the time of ED discharge and within 30 days. If our hypotheses are confirmed, the treatment protocol and CDSS could be recommended to other EDs to improve management of adults with AF or atrial flutter.

Development and Validation of a Diabetic Retinopathy Risk Stratification Algorithm Although diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, diabetes-related blindness can be prevented through effective screening, detection, and treatment of disease. The study goal was to develop risk stratification algorithms for the onset of retinal complications of diabetes, including proliferative diabetic retinopathy, referable retinopathy, and macular edema. Retrospective cohort analysis of patients from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry who had no evidence of diabetic retinopathy at a baseline diabetic retinopathy screening during 2008-2020 was performed. Machine learning and logistic regression prediction models for onset of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and referable retinopathy detected through routine screening were trained and internally validated. Model performance was assessed using area under the curve (AUC) metrics. The study cohort (N = 276,794) was 51.9% male and 42.1% White. Mean (\u00b1SD) age at baseline was 60.0 (\u00b113.1) years. A machine learning XGBoost algorithm was effective in identifying patients who developed Similar logistic model: 0.75-0.76). Relatively simple logistic regression models using nine readily available clinical variables can be used to rank order patients for onset of diabetic eye disease and thereby more efficiently prioritize and target screening for at risk patients.

TRENDS IN SMOKING-SPECIFIC LUNG CANCER INCIDENCE RATES WITHIN A U.S. INTEGRATED HEALTH SYSTEM, 2007-2018 At least 10% of lung cancers arise in adults who have never smoked. Data remain inconclusive on whether lung cancer incidence has been increasing among never-smoking adults. How have age-adjusted incidence rates of lung cancer changed temporally, especially among never-smoking adults? Trends in lung cancer incidence were examined using linked electronic health record and cancer registry data on a dynamic cohort of adults aged 30 years at risk for incident lung cancer between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2018 from an integrated healthcare system in northern California. Truncated age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rates and average annual percentage change (AAPC) in rates were estimated, overall and separately for ever- and never-smoking adults by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Our (52.5% 15.4% never-smoking) were diagnosed with lung cancer. The overall lung cancer incidence rate declined from 91.1 to 63.7 per 100,000 100,000 person-years (AAPC, -4.2%; 95% CI, -4.4%, -3.9%) and, to varying degrees, within all age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups. Among never-smoking adults, incidence rates were relatively constant, with three-year period estimates ranging from 19.9 to 22.6 per 100,000 person-years (AAPC, 0.9%; 95% CI, -0.3%, 2.1%). Incidence rates for never-smoking adults appeared stable over time within age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups, except for those of Asian and Pacific Islander (API) origin (AAPC, 2.0%; 95% CI, 0.1%, 3.9%), whose rates were about twice as high compared to their counterparts. These observed trends underscore the need to further elucidate the etiology of lung cancer in never-smoking adults, including why incidence is higher and rising in never-smoking API adults.

Identifying Predictors of Homelessness Among Adults in a Large Integrated Health System in Northern California Introduction Homelessness contributes to worsening health and increased health care costs. There is little published research that leverages rich electronic health record (EHR) data to predict future homelessness risk and inform interventions to address it. The authors' objective was to develop a model for predicting future homelessness using individual EHR and geographic data covariates. Methods This retrospective cohort study included 2,543,504 adult members ( 18 years old) from Kaiser Permanente Northern California and evaluated which covariates predicted a composite outcome of homelessness status (hospital discharge documentation of a homeless patient, medical diagnosis of homelessness, approved medical financial assistance application for homelessness, and/or \"homeless/shelter\" in address name). The predictors were measured in 2018-2019 and included prior diagnoses and demographic and geographic data. The outcome was measured in 2020. The cohort was split (70:30) into a derivation and validation set, and logistic regression was used to model the outcome. Results Homelessness prevalence was 0.35% in the overall sample. The final logistic regression model included 26 prior diagnoses, demographic, and geographic-level predictors. The regression model using the validation set had moderate sensitivity (80.4%) and specificity (83.2%) for predicting future cases of homelessness and achieved excellent classification properties (area under the curve of 0.891 [95% confidence interval = 0.884-0.897]). Discussion This prediction model can be used as an initial triage step to enhance screening and referral tools for identifying and addressing homelessness, which can improve health and reduce health care costs. Conclusions EHR data can be used to predict chance of homelessness at a population health level. Authors: Rodriguez, Luis A; 15;27(1):56-71. Epub 2023-03-13. Data-driven classification of health status of older adults with diabetes: The diabetes and aging study We set out to identify empirically-derived health status classes of older adults with diabetes based on clusters of comorbid conditions which are associated with future complications. We conducted a cohort study among 105,786 older (65 years of age) adults with type 2 diabetes enrolled in an integrated healthcare delivery system. We used latent class analysis of 19 baseline comorbidities to derive health status classes and then compared incident complication rates (events per 100 person-years) by health status class during 5 years of follow-up. Complications included infections, hyperglycemic events, hypoglycemic events, microvascular events, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality. Three health status classes were identified: Class 1 (58% of the cohort) had the lowest prevalence of most baseline comorbidities, Class 2 (22%) had the highest prevalence of obesity, arthritis, and depression, and Class 3 (20%) had the highest prevalence of cardiovascular conditions. The risk for incident complications was highest for Class 3, intermediate for Class 2 and lowest for Class 1. For example, the age, sex and race-adjusted rates for cardiovascular events (per 100 person-years) for Class 3, Class 2 and Class 1 were 6.5, 2.3, and 1.6, respectively; 2.1, 1.2, 0.7 for hypoglycemia; and 8.0, 3.8, and 2.3 for mortality. Three health status classes of older adults with diabetes were identified based on prevalent comorbidities and were associated with marked differences in risk of complications. These health status classes can inform population health management and guide the individualization of diabetes care. Authors: Huang, Elbert J J Am Geriatr Soc. 2023 Mar 08. Using Peer Support to Prevent Diabetes: Results of a Pragmatic RCT High-contact structured diabetes prevention programs are effective in lowering weight and HbA1cs, yet their intensity level can create barriers to participation. Peer support programs improve clinical outcomes among adults with Type 2 diabetes, but their effectiveness in diabetes prevention is unknown. This study examined whether a low-intensity peer support program improved outcomes more than enhanced usual care in a diverse population with prediabetes. The intervention was tested in a pragmatic 2-arm RCT. Participants were adults with prediabetes at 3 healthcare centers. Participants randomized to the enhanced usual care arm received educational materials. Participants in the Using Peer Support to Aid in Prevention and Treatment in Prediabetes arm were matched with a peer supporter: another patient who had made healthy lifestyle changes and was trained in autonomy-supportive action planning. Peer supporters were instructed to provide weekly telephone support to their peers on specific action steps toward behavioral goals for 6 months, then monthly support for 6 months. Changes in primary outcomes of weight and HbA1c and secondary outcomes of enrollment in formal diabetes prevention programs, self-reported diet, physical activity, health-specific social support, self-efficacy, motivation, and activation at 6 and 12 months were examined. Data collection occurred from October 2018 to March 2022, with analyses completed in September 2022. Among 355 randomized patients, in intention-to-treat analyses, there were no between-group differences in HbA1c or weight changes at 6 and 12 months. Using Peer Support to Aid in Prevention and Treatment in Prediabetes participants were more likely to enroll in structured programs at 6 (AOR=2.45, p=0.009) and 12 (AOR=2.21, p=0.016) months and to report eating whole grains at 6 (4.49, p=0.026) and 12 (4.22, p=0.034) months. They reported greater improvements in perceived social support for diabetes prevention behaviors at 6 (6.39, p<0.001) and 12 (5.48, p<0.001) months, with no differences in other measures. A stand-alone, low-intensity peer support program improved social support and participation in formal diabetes prevention programs but not weight or HbA1c. It will be important to examine whether peer support could effectively complement higher-intensity, structured diabetes prevention programs.

Telehealth During COVID-19 for Adults with Multiple Chronic Conditions: Associations with Self-Reported Food Insecurity and with Physical Limitations Background: Adults with chronic medical conditions complicated by food insecurity or physical limitations may have higher barriers to accessing telehealth implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To examine the relationships of self-reported food insecurity and physical limitations with changes in health care utilization and medication adherence comparing the year before (March 2019-February 2020) and the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020-March 2021) among patients with chronic conditions insured by Medicaid or Medicare Advantage. Methods: A prospective cohort study of 10,452 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members insured by Medicaid and 52,890 Kaiser Permanente Colorado members insured by Medicare Advantage was conducted. Difference-in-differences (DID) between the pre-COVID and COVID years in telehealth versus in-person health care utilization and adherence to chronic disease medicines by food insecurity and by physical limitation status were measured. Results: Food insecurity and physical limitations were each associated with small but significantly greater shifts from in-person to telehealth. Medicare Advantage members with physical limitations also had significantly greater decline in adherence to chronic medications from year to year compared with those without physical limitations (DID from pre-COVID year to COVID year ranged from 0.7% to 3.6% greater decline by medication class, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Food insecurity and physical limitations did not present significant barriers to the transition to telehealth during the COVID pandemic. The greater decrease in medication adherence among older patients with physical limitations suggests that care systems must further address the needs of this high-risk population.

Associations of polygenic risk scores with posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories following combat deployment Identification of genetic risk factors may inform the prevention and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study evaluates the associations of polygenic risk scores (PRS) with patterns of posttraumatic stress symptoms following combat deployment. US Army soldiers of European ancestry (n = 4900) provided genomic data and ratings of posttraumatic stress symptoms before and after deployment to Afghanistan in 2012. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to model posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories among participants who provided post-deployment data (n = 4353). Multinomial logistic regression models tested independent associations between trajectory membership and PRS for PTSD, major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia, neuroticism, alcohol use disorder, and suicide attempt, controlling for age, sex, ancestry, and exposure to potentially traumatic events, and weighted to account for uncertainty in trajectory classification and missing data. Participants were classified PTSD-PRS and MDD-PRS were associated with greater odds of membership in the high-severity v. low-severity trajectory [adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence 1.23 (1.04-1.28), respectively]. Additionally, MDD-PRS was associated with greater odds of membership in the decreasing-severity v. low-severity trajectory [1.16 (1.03-1.31)]. No other associations were statistically significant. Higher polygenic risk for PTSD or MDD is associated with more severe posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories following combat deployment. PRS may help stratify at-risk individuals, enabling more precise targeting of treatment and programs. Authors: Stein, Murray B Psychol Med. 2023 Mar 06:1-10. Evaluation of the Emergency Severity Index in US Emergency Departments for the Rate of Mistriage Accurate emergency department (ED) triage is essential to prioritize the most critically ill patients and distribute resources appropriately. The most used triage system in the US is the Emergency Severity Index (ESI). To derive and validate an algorithm to assess the rate of mistriage and to identify characteristics associated with mistriage. This retrospective cohort study created operational definitions for each ESI level that use ED visit electronic health record data to classify encounters as undertriaged, overtriaged, or correctly triaged. These definitions were applied to a retrospective cohort to assess variation in triage accuracy by facility and patient characteristics in 21 EDs within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) health care system. All ED encounters by patients 18 years and older between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, were assessed for eligibility. Encounters with missing ESI or incomplete ED time variables and patients who left against medical advice or without being seen were excluded. Data were analyzed between January 1, 2021, and November 30, 2022. Assigned ESI level. Rate of undertriage and overtriage by assigned ESI level based on a mistriage algorithm and patient and visit characteristics associated with undertriage and overtriage. A total of 5 315 176 ED encounters were included. The mean (SD) patient age was 52 (21) years; 44.3% of patients were men and 55.7% were women. In terms of race and ethnicity, 11.1% of participants were Asian, 15.1% were Black, 21.4% were Hispanic, 44.0% were non-Hispanic White, and 8.5% were of other (includes American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and multiple races or ethnicities), unknown, or missing race or ethnicity. Mistriage occurred in 1 713 260 encounters (32.2%), of which 176 131 (3.3%) were undertriaged and 1 537 129 (28.9%) were overtriaged. The sensitivity of ESI to identify a patient with high-acuity illness (correctly assigning ESI I or II among patients who had a life-stabilizing intervention) was 65.9%. In adjusted analyses, Black patients had a 4.6% (95% CI, 4.3%-4.9%) greater relative risk of overtriage and an 18.5% (95% CI, 16.9%-20.0%) greater relative risk of undertriage compared with White patients, while Black male patients had a 9.9% (95% CI, 9.8%-10.0%) greater relative risk of overtriage and a 41.0% (95% CI, 40.0%-41.9%) greater relative risk of undertriage compared with White female patients. High relative risk of undertriage was found among patients taking high-risk medications (30.3% [95% CI, 28.3%-32.4%]) and those with a greater comorbidity burden (22.4% [95% CI, 20.1%-24.4%]) and recent intensive care unit utilization (36.7% [95% CI, 30.5%-41.4%]). In this retrospective cohort study of over 5 million ED encounters, mistriage with ESI was common. Quality improvement should focus on limiting critical undertriage, optimizing resource allocation by patient need, and promoting equity.

Practice Patterns and Outcomes Associated With Anticoagulation Use Following Sepsis Hospitalizations With New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation Practice patterns and outcomes associated with the use of oral anticoagulation for arterial thromboembolism prevention following a hospitalization with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) during sepsis are unclear. Retrospective, observational cohort study of patients 40 years of age discharged alive following hospitalization with new-onset AF during sepsis across 21 hospitals in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care delivery system, years 2011 to 2018. Primary outcomes were ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), with a safety outcome of major bleeding events, both within 1 year of discharge alive from sepsis hospitalization. Adjusted risk differences for outcomes between patients who did and did not receive oral anticoagulation within 30 days of discharge were estimated using marginal structural models fitted by inverse probability weighting using Super Learning within a target trial emulation framework. Among 82 748 patients hospitalized with sepsis, 3992 (4.8%) had new-onset AF and survived to hospital discharge; mean age was 78\u00b111 years, 53% were men, and 70% were White. Patients with new-onset AF during sepsis averaged 45\u00b133% of telemetry monitoring entries with AF, and 27% had AF present on the day of hospital discharge. Within 1 year of hospital discharge, 89 (2.2%) patients experienced stroke/TIA, 225 (5.6%) had major bleeding, and 1011 (25%) died. Within 30 days of discharge, 807 (20%) patients filled oral anticoagulation prescriptions, which were associated with higher 1-year adjusted risks of ischemic stroke/TIA (5.69% versus 2.32%; risk difference, 3.37% [95% CI, 0.36-6.38]) and no significant difference in 1-year adjusted risks of major bleeding (6.51% versus 7.10%; risk difference, -0.59% [95% CI, -3.09 to 1.91]). Sensitivity analysis of ischemic stroke-only outcomes showed a risk difference of 0.15% (95% CI, -1.72 to 2.03). After hospitalization with new-onset AF during sepsis, oral anticoagulation use was uncommon and associated with potentially higher stroke/TIA risk. Further research to inform mechanisms of stroke and TIA and management of new-onset AF after sepsis is needed. Authors: Mar;16(3):e009494. Epub 2023-02-28. Racial and Ethnic Differences in Medication Initiation Among Adults Newly Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Given persistent racial/ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes outcomes and the lasting benefits conferred by early glycemic control, we examined racial/ethnic differences in diabetes medication initiation during the year following diagnosis. Among adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (2005-2016), we examined how glucose-lowering medication initiation differed by race/ethnicity during the year following diagnosis. We specified modified Poisson regression models to estimate the association between race/ethnicity and medication initiation in the entire cohort and within subpopulations defined by HbA1c, BMI, age at diagnosis, comorbidity, and neighborhood deprivation index (a census tract-level socioeconomic indicator). Among the 77,199 newly diagnosed individuals, 47% started a diabetes medication within 12 months of diagnosis. The prevalence of medication initiation ranged from 32% among Chinese individuals to 58% among individuals of Other/Unknown races/ethnicities. Compared to White individuals, medication initiation was less likely among Chinese (relative risk: 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.72, 0.84)) and Japanese (0.82 (0.75, 0.90)) individuals, but was more likely among Hispanic/Latinx (1.27 (1.24, 1.30)), African American (1.14 (1.11, 1.17)), other Asian (1.13 (1.08, 1.18)), South Asian (1.10 (1.04, 1.17)), Other/Unknown (1.31 (1.24, 1.39)), American Indian or Alaska Native (1.11 (1.04, 1.18)), and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (1.28 (1.19, 1.37)) individuals. Racial/ethnic differences dissipated among individuals with higher HbA1c values. Initiation of glucose-lowering treatment during the year following type 2 diabetes diagnosis differed markedly by race/ethnicity, particularly for those with lower HbA1c values. Future research should examine how patient preferences, provider implicit bias, and shared decision-making contribute to these early treatment differences. Mar;38(4):994-1000. Epub 2022-08-04. Among-Hospital Variation in ICU Admission Practices and Associated Outcomes for Patients with Acute Respiratory Failure Rationale: We have previously shown that hospital strain is associated with intensive care unit (ICU) admission and that ICU admission, compared with ward admission, may benefit certain patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Objectives: To understand how strain-process-outcomes relationships in patients with ARF may vary among hospitals and what hospital practice differences may account for such variation. Methods: We examined high-acuity patients with ARF who did not require mechanical ventilation or vasopressors in the emergency department (ED) and were admitted to 27 U.S. hospitals from 2013 to 2018. Stratifying by hospital, we compared hospital strain-ICU admission relationships and hospital length of stay (LOS) and mortality among patients initially admitted to the ICU versus the ward using hospital strain as a previously validated instrumental variable. We also surveyed hospital practices and, in exploratory analyses, evaluated their associations with the above processes and outcomes. Results: There was significant among-hospital variation in ICU admission rates, in hospital strain-ICU admission relationships, and in the association of ICU admission with hospital LOS and hospital mortality. Overall, ED patients with ARF (n = 45,339) experienced a 0.82-day shorter median hospital LOS if admitted initially to the ICU compared with the ward, but among the 27 hospitals (n = 224-3,324), this effect varied from 5.85 days shorter (95% confidence interval [CI], -8.84 to -2.86; P < 0.001) 4.38 days longer (95% CI, 1.86-6.90; P = 0.001). Corresponding ranges for in-hospital mortality with ICU compared with ward admission revealed odds ratios from 0.08 (95% CI, 0.01-0.56; P < 0.007) to 8.89 (95% CI, 1.60-79.85; P = 0.016) among patients with ARF (pooled odds ratio, 0.75). In exploratory analyses, only a small number of measured hospital practices-the presence of a sepsis ED disposition guideline and maximum ED patient capacity-were potentially associated with hospital strain-ICU admission relationships. Conclusions: Hospitals vary considerably in ICU admission rates, the sensitivity of those rates to hospital capacity strain, and the benefits of ICU admission for patients with ARF not requiring life support therapies in the ED. Future work is needed to more fully identify hospital-level factors contributing to these relationships. Authors: Anesi, George L; Liu, Vincent X; et al. Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2023 Mar;20(3):406-413. Development and Validation of an Electronic Health Record-based Score for Triage to Perioperative Medicine To develop an electronic health record-based risk model for perioperative medicine (POM) triage and compare this model with legacy triage practices that were based on clinician assessment. POM clinicians seek to address the increasingly complex medical needs of patients prior to scheduled surgery. Identifying which patients might derive the most benefit from evaluation is challenging. Elective surgical cases performed within a health system 2014- 2019 (N = 470,727) were used to develop a predictive score, called the Comorbidity Assessment for Surgical Triage (CAST) score, using split validation. CAST incorporates patient and surgical case characteristics to predict the risk of 30-day post-operative morbidity, defined as a composite of mortality and major NSQIP complications. Thresholds of CAST were then selected to define risk groups, which correspond with triage to POM appointments of different durations and modalities. The predictive discrimination CAST score was compared with the surgeon's assessments of patient complexity and the American Society of Anesthesiologists class. The CAST score demonstrated a significantly higher discrimination for predicting post-operative morbidity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.75) than the surgeon's complexity designation (0.63; P < 0.001) or the American Society of Anesthesiologists (0.65; P < 0.001) ( Fig. 1 ). Incorporating the complexity designation in the CAST model did not significantly alter the discrimination (0.75; P = 0.098). Compared with the complexity designation, classification based on CAST score groups resulted a net reclassification improvement index of 10.4% ( P < 0.001) ( Table 1 ). A parsimonious electronic health record-based predictive model demonstrates improved performance for identifying pre-surgical patients who are at risk than previously-used assessments for POM triage.

Sex- and ethnic-specific patterns in the incidence of hip fracture among older US Asian and non-Hispanic White adults Asian and Pacific Islander (Asian/PI) adults have lower hip fracture incidence than non-Hispanic White (NHW) adults, but data regarding Asian/PI subgroups are limited. We compared hip fracture incidence among older US Asian/PI and NHW populations, including ethnic subgroup differences. Using observational data from a California healthcare system, we identified Asian/PI and NHW adults aged 50 years (2000-2019) and followed subjects to 2021 for hip fracture determined by principal/primary hospital diagnosis or by secondary hospital diagnosis with hip/femur procedure codes. Age-adjusted hip fracture incidence was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Log-Poisson regression was used to determine fracture incidence rate ratios (IRRs, [CI]; NHW or Chinese as reference) adjusting for age and year. Among 215,359 Asian/PI and 776,839 NHW women, hip fracture incidence was 1.34 (1.28-1.40) and 2.97 (2.94-3.01) per 1000 person-years, 188,328 Asian/PI NHW fracture was 0.62 (0.58-0.67) and (1.78-1.84) per 1000 person-years, respectively, with 0.34 (0.32-0.37). subgroups, 0.85 [0.75-0.96]) had lower, and (IRR 1.36 [1.20-1.54]) and South Asian (IRR 1.36 [1.07-1.72]) women had higher hip fracture incidence compared to Chinese women. Hip fracture incidence was only higher among South Asian (IRR 1.61 [1.21-2.14]) compared to Chinese men. Hip fracture incidence among US Asian/PI adults was 55% (women) and 66% (men) lower than NHW adults, but incidence varied by Asian/PI subgroup. The heterogeneity among Asian/PI adults highlights the importance of examining fracture risk by ethnic subgroup.

Hospital Strain and Variation in Sepsis ICU Admission Practices and Associated Outcomes To understand how strain-process-outcome relationships in patients with sepsis may vary among hospitals. Retrospective cohort study using a validated hospital capacity strain index as a within-hospital instrumental variable governing ICU versus ward admission, stratified by hospital. Twenty-seven U.S. hospitals from 2013 to 2018. High-acuity emergency department patients with sepsis who do not require life support therapies. None. The mean predicted probability of ICU admission across strain deciles ranged from 4.9% (lowest ICU-utilizing hospital for sepsis without life support) to 61.2% (highest ICU-utilizing hospital for sepsis without life support). The difference in the predicted probabilities of ICU admission between the lowest and highest strain deciles ranged from 9.0% (least strain-sensitive hospital) to 45.2% (most strain-sensitive hospital). In pooled analyses, emergency department patients with sepsis (n = 90,150) experienced a 1.3-day longer median hospital length of stay (LOS) if admitted initially to the ICU compared with the ward, but across the 27 study hospitals (n = 517-6,564), this effect varied from 9.0 days shorter (95% CI, -10.8 to -7.2; p < 0.001) to 19.0 days longer (95% CI, 16.7-21.3; p < 0.001). Corresponding ranges for inhospital mortality with ICU compared with ward admission revealed odds ratios (ORs) from 0.16 (95% CI, 0.03-0.99; p = 0.04) to 4.62 (95% CI, 1.16-18.22; p = 0.02) among patients with sepsis (pooled OR = 1.48). There is significant among-hospital variation in ICU admission rates for patients with sepsis not requiring life support therapies, how sensitive those ICU admission decisions are to hospital capacity strain, and the association of ICU admission with hospital LOS and hospital mortality. Hospital-level heterogeneity should be considered alongside patient-level heterogeneity in critical and acute care study design and interpretation. Authors: Anesi, George L; Feb;5(2):e0858. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptom trajectories in a 16-month COVID-19 pandemic period COVID-19 pandemic presents an unheralded opportunity to better understand trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms across a prolonged period of social disruption and stress. We tracked PTSD symptoms among trauma-exposed individuals in the United States and sought to identify population-based variability in PTSD symptom trajectories and understand what, if any, early pandemic experiences predicted membership in one trajectory versus others. As part of a longitudinal study of U.S. residents during the pandemic, participants who reported at least one potentially traumatic experience in their lifetime (N = 1,206) at Wave 1 (April 2020) were included in the current study. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PCL-5 at four time points extending to July 2021. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify heterogeneous symptom trajectories. Trajectory membership was regressed on experiences from the early stage of the pandemic as measured using the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory in a model that controlled for variables with documented associations to PTSD trajectories, including age, sex, income, and trauma history. Four trajectories were identified, categorized as resilient (73.0%), recurring (13.3%), recovering (8.3%), and chronic (5.5%). Emotional and physical health problems and positive changes associated with the early phase of the pandemic were each significant predictors of trajectory membership over and above all other variables in the model. Predictors primarily differentiated the resilient trajectory from each of the other three trajectories. Distinct PTSD symptom trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic suggest a need for targeted efforts to help individuals at most risk for ongoing distress.

Cross-Sectional Association of Patient Language and Patient-Provider Language Concordance with Video Telemedicine Use Among Patients with Limited English Proficiency Telemedicine's dramatic increase during the COVID-19 pandemic elevates the importance of addressing patient-care gaps in telemedicine, especially for patients with limited English proficiency. To examine the associations of patient language and patient-provider language concordance with telemedicine visit type (video versus telephone visit). Cross-sectional automated data study of patient-scheduled primary care telemedicine appointments from March 16, 2020, to October 31, 2020. Northern California integrated healthcare delivery system. All 22,427 completed primary care telemedicine visits scheduled by 13,764 patients with limited English proficiency via the patient portal. Cross-sectional association of electronic health record-documented patient language (Spanish as referent) and patient-provider language concordance with patients' choice of a video (versus telephone) visit, accounting for patient sociodemographics, technology access, and technology familiarity factors. Of all patient-scheduled visits, 34.5% (n = 7747) were video visits. The top three patient languages were Spanish (42.4%), Cantonese (16.9%), and Mandarin (10.3%). Adjusting for sociodemographic and technology access and familiarity factors and compared to patients speaking Spanish, video visit use was higher among patients speaking Cantonese (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.18-1.52), Mandarin (OR = 1.33, (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.09-1.47), but lower among patients speaking Punjabi (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.62-0.91). Language concordance was associated with lower video visit use (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.80-0.93) and moderated associations of speaking Spanish, Cantonese, and Korean with video visit use. In addition, for all language groups, those with prior video visit use were more likely to re-use video visits compared to those with no prior use (p < .05 for all languages except Hindi with p = 0.06). Among linguistically diverse patients with limited English proficiency, video telemedicine use differed by specific language. Disaggregating patient subpopulation data is necessary for identifying those at greatest risk of being negatively impacted by the digital divide. Authors: Hsueh, Intern Med. 2023 Feb;38(3):633-640.

Risk of cardiac events after elective versus urgent or emergent noncardiac surgery: Implications for quality measurement and improvement Patient populations differ for elective vs urgent and emergent surgery. The effect of this difference on surgical outcome is not well understood and may be important for improving surgical safety. Our primary hypothesis was that there is an association of surgical acuity with risk of postoperative cardiac events. Secondarily, we examined elective vs urgent and emergent patients separately to understand patient characteristics that are associated with postoperative cardiac events. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients 65 years undergoing noncardiac elective or urgent/emergent surgery. Logistic regression estimated the association of surgical acuity with a postoperative cardiac event, which was defined as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest within 30 days of surgery. For the secondary analysis, we modeled the outcome after stratifying by acuity. The study included 161,177 patients with 1014 cardiac events. The unadjusted risk of a postoperative cardiac event was 3.2 per 1000 among elective patients and 28.7 per 1000 among urgent and emergent patients (adjusted odds ratio 4.10, 95% confidence interval 3.56-4.72). After adjustment, increased age, higher baseline cardiac risk, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, worse American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical classification, and longer operative time were associated with a postoperative cardiac event. Higher baseline cardiac risk was more strongly associated with postoperative cardiac events in elective patients. In contrast, worse ASA physical classification was more strongly associated with postoperative cardiac events in urgent and emergent patients. Black patients had higher odds of a postoperative cardiac event only in urgent and emergent patients compared to White patients. Quality measurement and improvement to address postoperative cardiac risk should consider patients based on surgical acuity. COVID-19 bacteremic co-infection is a major risk factor for mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation Recent single-center reports have suggested that community-acquired bacteremic co-infection in the context of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be an important driver of mortality; however, these reports have not been validated with a multicenter, demographically diverse, cohort study with data spanning the pandemic. In this multicenter, retrospective cohort study, inpatient encounters were assessed for COVID-19 with community-acquired bacteremic co-infection using 48-h post-admission blood cultures co-infection [recovery of bacterial pathogen], (2) suspected co-infection [negative culture with 2 antimicrobials administered], and (3) no evidence of co-infection [no culture]. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation. COVID-19 bacterial co-infection risk factors and impact on primary outcomes were determined using multivariate logistic regressions and expressed as adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (Cohort, OR 95% CI, Wald test p value). The studied cohorts included 13,781 COVID-19 inpatient encounters from 2020 to 2022 in the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB, n = 4075) and Ochsner Louisiana State University Health-Shreveport (OLHS, n = 9706) cohorts with confirmed (2.5%), suspected (46%), or no community-acquired bacterial co-infection (51.5%) and a comparison cohort consisting of 99,170 inpatient encounters from 2010 to 2019 (UAB pre-COVID-19 pandemic cohort). Significantly increased likelihood of COVID-19 bacterial co-infection was observed in patients with elevated 15 neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (UAB: 1.95 [1.21-3.07]; OLHS: 3.65 [2.66-5.05], p < for both) within 48-h of hospital admission. Bacterial co-infection was found to confer the greatest increased risk for in-hospital mortality (UAB: 3.07 [2.42-5.46]; OLHS: 4.05 [2.29-6.97], 4.47 [2.87-7.09], OLHS: 2.65 [2.00-3.48], p < mechanical ventilation (UAB: 3.84 [2.21-6.12]; OLHS: 2.75 [1.87-3.92], p < 0.001 for both) across both cohorts, as compared to other risk factors for severe disease. Observed mortality in COVID-19 bacterial co-infection (24%) dramatically exceeds the mortality rate associated with community-acquired bacteremia in pre-COVID-19 pandemic inpatients (5.9%) and was alpha, delta, and omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants. Elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a prognostic indicator of COVID-19 bacterial co-infection within 48-h of admission. Community-acquired bacterial co-infection, as defined by blood culture-positive results, confers greater increased risk of in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation than previously described risk factors (advanced age, select comorbidities, male sex) for COVID-19 mortality, and is independent of SARS-CoV-2 variant.

Associations between alcohol brief intervention in primary care and drinking and health outcomes in adults with hypertension and type 2 diabetes: a population-based observational study To evaluate associations between alcohol brief intervention (BI) in primary care and 12-month drinking outcomes and 18-month health outcomes among adults with hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D). A population-based observational study using electronic health records data. An integrated healthcare system that implemented system-wide alcohol screening, BI and referral to treatment in adult primary care. Adult primary care patients with hypertension (N=72 979) or T2D (N=19 642) who screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use between 2014 and 2017. We examined four drinking outcomes: changes in heavy drinking days/past 3 months, drinking days/week, drinks/drinking day and drinks/week from baseline to 12-month follow-up, based on results of alcohol screens conducted in routine care. Health outcome measures were changes in measured systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and BP reduction 3 mm Hg at 18-month follow-up. For patients with T2D, we also examined change (HbA1c) level and 'controlled HbA1c' (HbA1c<8%) at 18-month follow-up. For patients with hypertension, those who received BI had a modest but significant additional -0.06 reduction in drinks/drinking day (95% CI -0.11 to -0.01) and in drinks/week (95% CI -0.59 to -0.01) at 12 months, compared with those who did not. Patients with hypertension who received BI also had higher odds for having clinically meaningful reduction of diastolic BP at 18 months (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.09). Among patients with T2D, no significant associations were found between BI and drinking or health outcomes examined. Alcohol BI holds promise for reducing drinking and helping to improve health outcomes among patients with hypertension who screened positive for unhealthy drinking. However, similar associations were not observed among patients with T2D. More research is needed to understand the heterogeneity across diverse subpopulations and to study BI's long-term public health impact. Authors: Chi, Felicia W; Jan 19;13(1):e064088. Epub 2023-01-19. The Safety of Inpatient Health Care Adverse events during hospitalization are a major cause of patient harm, as documented in the 1991 Harvard Medical Practice Study. Patient safety has changed substantially in the decades since that study was conducted, and a more current assessment of harm during hospitalization is warranted. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the frequency, preventability, and severity of patient harm in a random sample of admissions from 11 Massachusetts hospitals during the 2018 calendar year. The occurrence of adverse events was assessed with the use of a trigger method (identification of information in a medical record that was previously shown to be associated with adverse events) and from review of medical records. Trained nurses reviewed records and identified admissions with possible adverse events that were then adjudicated by physicians, who confirmed the presence and characteristics of the adverse events. In a random sample of 2809 admissions, we identified at least one adverse event in 23.6%. Among 978 adverse events, 222 (22.7%) were judged to be preventable and 316 (32.3%) had a severity level of serious (i.e., caused harm that resulted in substantial intervention or prolonged recovery) or higher. A preventable adverse event occurred in 191 (6.8%) of all admissions, and a preventable adverse event with a severity level of serious or higher occurred in 29 (1.0%). There were seven deaths, one of which was deemed to be preventable. Adverse drug events were the most common adverse events (accounting for 39.0% of all events), followed by surgical or other procedural events (30.4%), patient-care events (which were defined as events associated with nursing care, including falls and pressure ulcers) (15.0%), and health care-associated infections (11.9%). Adverse events were identified in nearly one in four admissions, and approximately one fourth of the events were preventable. These findings underscore the importance of patient safety and the need for continuing improvement.

Cigarette Smoking and Risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Disease Severity Among Adults in an Integrated Health Care System in California The relationship between tobacco smoking status and SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity is highly debated. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of?>2.4 million adults in a large healthcare system to evaluate whether smoking is associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. This retrospective cohort study of 2,427,293 adults in KPNC from March 5, 2020 (baseline) to December 31, 2020 (pre-vaccine) included smoking status (current, former, never), socio-demographics, and comorbidities from the electronic health record. SARS-CoV-2 infection (identified by a positive PCR test) and COVID-19 severity (hospitalization, ICU admission or death???30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis) were estimated in time-to-event analyses using Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusting for covariates. Secondary analyses examined COVID-19 severity among patients with COVID-19 using logistic regression. During the study, 44,270 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Current smoking was associated with lower adjusted rates of SARS-CoV-2 never-smoking. Former smoking was associated with a lower adjusted rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR?=?0.96 95% CI: 0.94-0.99) never-smoking. Logistic regression analyses among patients with COVID-19 found lower odds of hospitalization for current versus never-smoking and higher odds of hospitalization and death for former versus never-smoking. In the largest US study to date on smoking and COVID-19, current and former smoking showed lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than never-smoking, while a history of smoking was associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19. In this cohort study of 2.4 million adults, adjusting for socio-demographics and medical comorbidities, current tobacco smoking was associated with a lower risk of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 illness compared to never-smoking. A history of smoking was associated with a slightly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a modestly higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness compared to never-smoking. The lower observed COVID-19 risk for current versus never-smoking deserves further investigation.

Mortality Following Diagnosis of Nontraumatic Intracerebral Hemorrhage Within an Integrated \"Hub-and-Spoke\" Neuroscience Care Model: Is Spoke Presentation Noninferior to Hub Presentation? Practice guidelines recommend that patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) be treated in units with acute neuroscience care experience. However, most hospitals in the United States lack this degree of specialization. We sought to examine outcome differences for patients with nontraumatic ICH presenting to centers with and without advanced neuroscience care specialization. This was a retrospective study of adult patients presenting with nontraumatic ICH between 1/1/2011 and 9/30/2020 across 21 medical centers within Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated care system that employs a \"hub-and-spoke\" model of neuroscience care in which two centers service as neuroscience \"hubs\" and the remaining 19 centers service as referral \"spokes.\" Patients presenting to spokes can receive remote consultation (including image review) by neurosurgical or neurointensive care specialists located at hubs. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. We used hierarchical logistic regression, adjusting for ICH score components, comorbidities, and demographics, to test a hypothesis that initial presentation to a spoke medical center was noninferior to hub presentation [defined as an odds ratio (OR) with an upper 95% confidence interval (CI) limit of 1.24 or less]. A total of 6978 patients were included, with 6170 (88%) initially presenting to spoke medical centers. The unadjusted 90-day mortality for patients initially presenting to spoke versus hub medical centers was 32.2% and 32.7%, respectively. In adjusted analysis, presentation to a spoke medical center was neither noninferior nor inferior for 90-day mortality risk (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.84-1.74). Sensitivity analysis excluding patients admitted to general wards or lacking continuous health plan insurance during the follow-up period trended closer to a noninferior result (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69-1.44). Within an integrated \"hub-and-spoke\" neuroscience care model, the risk of 90-day mortality following initial presentation with nontraumatic ICH to a spoke medical center was not conclusively noninferior compared with initial presentation to a hub medical center. However, there was also no indication that care for selected patients with nontraumatic ICH within medical centers lacking advanced neuroscience specialization resulted in significantly inferior outcomes. This finding may support the safety and efficiency of a \"hub-and-spoke\" care model for patients with nontraumatic ICH, although additional investigations are warranted.

Primary care video and telephone telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic: treatment and follow-up health care utilization Telemedicine use expanded greatly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and broad use of telemedicine is expected to persist beyond the pandemic. More evidence on the efficiency and safety of different telemedicine modalities is needed to inform clinical and policy decisions around telemedicine use. To evaluate the efficiency and safety of telemedicine, we compared treatment and follow-up care between video and telephone visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Observational study of patient-scheduled telemedicine visits for primary care. We used multivariate logistic regression to compare treatment (medication prescribing, laboratory/imaging orders) and 7-day follow-up care (in-person office visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations) between video and telephone visits, adjusted for patient characteristics. Among 734,442 telemedicine visits, 58.4% were telephone visits. Adjusted rates of medication prescribing and laboratory/imaging orders were higher in video visits than telephone visits, with differences of 3.5% (95% CI, 3.3%-3.8%) and 3.9% rates of 7-day follow-up in-person office visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were lower after video than telephone visits, with differences of 0.7% (95% CI, 0.02%-0.06%), respectively. Among telemedicine visits with primary care clinicians, return visits were not common and downstream emergency events were rare. Adjusted rates of treatment measures were higher and adjusted rates of follow-up care were lower for video visits than telephone visits. Although video visits were marginally more efficient than telephone visits, telephone visits may offer an accessible option to address patient primary care needs without raising safety concerns.

Risk of hospitalization in a sample of COVID-19 patients with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have worse coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)-related outcomes. We compared COVID-19 hospitalization risk in patients with and without COPD. This retrospective cohort study included patients 40 years, SARS-CoV-2 positive, and with Kaiser Permanente Northern California membership 1 year before COVID-19 diagnosis (electronic health records and claims data). COVID-19-related hospitalization risk was assessed by sequentially adjusted logistic regression models and stratified by disease severity. Secondary outcome was death/hospice referral after COVID-19. Of 19,558 COVID-19 patients, 697 (3.6%) had COPD. Compared with patients without COPD, COPD patients were older (median age: 69 vs 53 years); had higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (5 vs 0) and more median baseline outpatient (8 vs 4), emergency department (2 vs 1), and inpatient (2 vs 1) encounters. Unadjusted analyses showed increased odds of hospitalization with COPD (odds ratio [OR]: 3.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.40-4.60). After full risk adjustment, there were no differences in odds of hospitalization (OR: 1.14, with without COPD. Primary/secondary outcomes did not differ by COPD severity, except for higher odds of hospitalization in COPD patients requiring supplemental oxygen versus those without COPD (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.02-3.33). Except for hospitalization among patients using supplemental oxygen, no differences in odds of hospitalization or death/hospice referral were observed in the COVID-19 patient sample depending on whether they had COPD. Authors: Myers, Laura of anticoagulant dosing in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: An observational, comparative effectiveness study The question of anticoagulant dosing in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is unresolved, with randomized trials showing mixed results and heterogeneity of treatment effects for in-hospital death. To examine the association between the intensity of anticoagulation and clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 and respiratory impairment who were hospitalized between 3/1/2020-12/31/2020 in two Kaiser Permanente regions. We fit propensity score models using categorical regression to estimate the probability of receiving standard prophylactic, intermediate, or full-dose anticoagulation beginning on the day of admission or on the day of first respiratory deterioration. Exposure was defined by the highest dose on the day of admission or within 24?hours after deterioration. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. We included 17,130 patients in the day of admission analysis and 4,924 patients who experienced respiratory deterioration. There were no differences in propensity score-adjusted odds of in-hospital death for patients who received either intermediate (odds ratio [OR]: 1.00, 95% with standard prophylaxis beginning on the day of admission. Similarly, there were no differences in in-hospital death for either intermediate (OR: 1.22, compared with standard prophylaxis on the day of deterioration. Results of this real-world, comparative effectiveness study showed no differences in in-hospital death among newly admitted or deteriorating patients with COVID-19 who received intermediate-dose or full anticoagulation compared with standard prophylaxis.

Anakinra or high-dose COVID-19 pneumonia patients who deteriorate on low-dose dexamethasone: An observational study of comparative effectiveness To assess whether escalating to high-dose corticosteroids or anakinra compared with continuing low-dose corticosteroids reduced mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 whose respiratory function deteriorated while receiving dexamethasone 6 mg daily. We conducted a retrospective cohort study between March 1 to December 31, 2020, of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. In-hospital death was analyzed using logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting of receiving anakinra, high-dose corticosteroid (dexamethasone >10 mg daily), or remaining on low-dose corticosteroids on the day of first respiratory deterioration. We analyzed 6671 patients whose respiratory status deteriorated while receiving dexamethasone 6 mg daily for COVID-19 pneumonia, of whom 6265 stayed on low-dose corticosteroids, 232 were escalated to high-dose corticosteroids, and 174 to anakinra in addition to corticosteroids. The propensity score-adjusted odds of death were higher in the anakinra (odds ratio [OR] 1.76; 1.14-2.07) compared with those who continued low-dose corticosteroids on the day of respiratory deterioration. The odds of hospital-acquired infections were also higher in the anakinra (OR 2.00; CI 1.00-2.04) compared with low-dose corticosteroid group. Our findings do not support escalating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who deteriorate on low-dose corticosteroids John L; Liu, Vincent; K Int J Infect Dis. 2023 Jan;126:87-93. Epub 2022-11-18. Association between anaemia and hospital readmissions in patients undergoing major surgery requiring postoperative intensive care Anaemia is a common sequela of surgery, although its relationship with patient recovery is unclear. The goal of this investigation was to assess the associations between haemoglobin concentrations at the time of hospital discharge following major surgery and early post-hospitalisation outcomes, with a primary outcome of 30 day unanticipated hospital readmissions. This investigation includes data from two independent population-based observational cohorts of adult surgical patients (aged 18 years) requiring postoperative intensive care unit admission between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019 in hospitals in Olmsted County, Minnesota, and between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2017 in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated healthcare system, California. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the associations between discharge haemoglobin concentrations (per 10 g.l-1 ) and outcomes, with prespecified multivariable adjustment. A total of 3260 patients were included from Olmsted County hospitals and 29,452 from Kaiser Permanente Northern California. In adjusted analyses, each 10 g.l-1 decrease in haemoglobin at hospital discharge was associated with a 9% (hazard ratio 1.09, 95%CI 1.02-1.18; p = 0.014) and 8% increase (hazard ratio 1.08, 95%CI 1.06-1.11; p < 0.001) in the hazard for readmission within 30 days in Olmsted County and Kaiser Permanente Northern California, respectively. In a sensitivity analysis exploring relationships across varying levels of pre-operative anaemia severity, these associations remained consistent, with lower discharge haemoglobin concentrations associated with higher readmissions irrespective of pre-operative anaemia severity. Anaemia at hospital discharge in surgical patients requiring postoperative intensive care is associated with increased rates of hospital readmission in two large independent cohorts. Future studies are necessary to evaluate strategies to prevent and/or treat anaemia in these patients for the improvement of post-hospitalisation outcomes. Authors: Warner, M A; Hanson, A 2022-09-08.

Fostering a High-Functioning Team in Cancer Care Using the 4R Oncology Model: Assessment in a Large Health System and a Blueprint for Other Institutions Delivering cancer care by high-functioning multidisciplinary teams promises to address care fragmentation, which threatens care quality, affects patient outcomes, and strains the oncology workforce. We assessed whether the 4R Oncology model for team-based interdependent care delivery and patient self-management affected team functioning in a large community-based health system. 4R was deployed at four locations in breast and lung cancers and assessed along four characteristics of high-functioning teams: recognition as a team internally and externally; commitment to an explicit shared goal; enablement of interdependent work to achieve the goal; and engagement in regular reflection to adapt objectives and processes. We formed an internally and externally recognized team of 24 specialties committed to a shared goal of delivering multidisciplinary care at the optimal time and sequence from a patient-centric viewpoint. The team conducted 40 optimizations of interdependent care (22 for breast, seven for lung, and 11 for both cancers) at four points in the care continuum and established an ongoing teamwork adaptation process. Half of the optimizations entailed low effort, while 30% required high level of effort; 78% resulted in improved process efficiency. 4R facilitated development of a large high-functioning team and enabled 40 optimizations of interdependent care along the cancer care continuum in a feasible way. 4R may be an effective approach for fostering high-functioning teams, which could contribute to improving viability of the oncology workforce. Our intervention and taxonomy of results serve as a blueprint for other institutions motivated to strengthen teamwork to improve patient-centered care. Authors: Liu, Raymond; Gordon, 2022-09-30. Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Among Middle-Aged and Older Adult Vietnamese American Members of a Northern California Health Plan There is increasing recognition that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors vary by Asian subgroups. We examined CVD risk factor prevalence among Vietnamese adults in a northern California health plan. We used electronic health record data to examine smoking, overweight/obesity (body mass index 23.0 kg/m2), obesity (body mass index 27.5 kg/m2), prediabetes, diabetes, and hypertension among middle-aged (n = 12 757; aged 45-64 years) and older (n = 3418; aged 65-84 years) Vietnamese adults, including 37.8% whose preferred language was Vietnamese. Findings were compared with East Asian adults. Current smoking prevalence was 20.3% for middle-aged men, 7.0% for older men, and <1% for women in both age groups. Obesity prevalence was 12.0% for older men, 17.9% for middle-aged men, and 10% for women in both age groups. Among middle-aged men and women, 20.9% and 17.0% had hypertension and 13.5% and 8.5% had diabetes, respectively. Among older men and women, 64.0% and 60.0% had hypertension and 32.8% and 29.3% had diabetes, respectively. In both age groups, Vietnamese language preference was associated with higher risk of smoking (men only) and of diabetes and hypertension (women only). Compared with East Asian adults, Vietnamese adults had lower obesity prevalence but similar prevalence of diabetes, prediabetes, and hypertension. Vietnamese men were more likely and Vietnamese women less likely than East Asian adults to be current smokers. Study results suggest that more research on health conditions, lifestyle, and social factors among Vietnamese American adults is needed to develop culturally competent interventions to reduce CVD risk in this growing ethnic group.

Incidence and Medical Hospitalization Rates of Patients With Pediatric Eating Disorders Objective Eating disorders typically onset in preadolescence and adolescence and cause negative mental and physical health sequelae over the life span. This study examined the incidence and medical hospitalization rates of pediatric eating disorders in an integrated health system in the United States. Methods This retrospective cohort study examined 4883 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members 8-18 years of age with an eating disorder diagnosis from January 2015 to June 2019. Medical hospitalizations include admissions at any of the 13 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals with a primary or secondary eating disorder diagnosis. Results Incidence rates ranged between 177 and 205 per 100,000 adolescents per year. More than half the adolescents were non-White: 10.8% 0.5% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. Thirteen percent had a body mass index (BMI) below the 5th percentile, 61.8% had a BMI between the 5th and the percentiles, 19.7% had a BMI above the 85th an unknown BMI. During the 12-month follow-up period, 5.4% of adolescents had medical hospitalizations. Conclusions This study adds to the evidence that eating disorders affect children/adolescents across all weight/BMI ranges and racial/ethnic backgrounds. Future studies call for exploration on treatment strategies that tailor to the diverse populations. Authors: Lau, Josephine S; 2022-11-18. Team is brain: leveraging EHR audit log data for new insights into acute care processes To determine whether novel measures of contextual factors from multi-site electronic health record (EHR) audit log data can explain variation in clinical process outcomes. We selected one widely-used process outcome: emergency department (ED)-based team time to deliver tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We evaluated Epic audit log data (that tracks EHR user-interactions) for 3052 AIS patients aged 18+ who received tPA after presenting to an ED at three Northern California health systems (Stanford Health Care, UCSF Health, and Kaiser Permanente Northern California). Our primary outcome was door-to-needle time (DNT) and we assessed bivariate and multivariate relationships with six audit log-derived measures of treatment team busyness and prior team experience. Prior team experience was consistently associated with shorter DNT; teams with greater prior experience specifically on AIS cases had shorter DNT (minutes) across all sites: (Site 1: -94.73, to 23.17). Teams with greater prior experience across all types of cases also had shorter DNT at two sites: (Site 1: -6.96, 4.74). Team busyness was not consistently associated with DNT across study sites. EHR audit log data offers a novel, scalable approach to measure key contextual factors relevant to clinical process outcomes across multiple sites. Audit log-based measures of team experience were associated with better process outcomes for AIS care, suggesting opportunities to study underlying mechanisms and improve care through deliberate training, team-building, and scheduling to maximize team experience.

Persistent Steroid Exposure Before Coronavirus Disease 2019 Diagnosis and Risk of Hospitalization in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease It is unclear whether persistent inhaled steroid exposure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients before coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with hospitalization risk. To examine the association between persistent steroid exposure and COVID-19-related hospitalization risk in COPD. This retrospective cohort study used electronic health records from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California healthcare system (February 2, 2020, to September 30, 2020) for patients aged 40 years with COPD and a positive polymerase chain reaction test result for COVID-19. Primary exposure was persistent oral and/or inhaled steroid exposure defined as 6 months of prescriptions filled in the year before COVID-19 diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for the primary outcome of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death/hospice referral. Steroid exposure in the month before COVID-19 diagnosis was a covariate. Of >4.3 million adults, 697 had COVID-19 and COPD, of whom 270 (38.7%) had COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Overall, 538 (77.2%) were neither exposed to steroids in the month before COVID-19 diagnosis nor persistently exposed; 53 (7.6%) exposed in the month before but not persistently; 23 (3.3%) exposed persistently but not in the month before; and 83 (11.9%) exposed both persistently and in the month before. Adjusting for all confounders including steroid use in the month before, the odds ratio for hospitalization was 0.77 (95% CI 0.41-1.46) for patients persistently exposed to steroids before COVID-19 diagnosis. No association was observed between persistent steroid exposure and the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization in COPD patients. Authors: Myers, Laura C; Murray, corticosteroids in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia: an observational study of comparative effectiveness To assess whether high- compared with low-dose corticosteroids started upon hospitalization reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia or in subgroups stratified by severity of respiratory impairment on admission. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who required oxygen supplementation upon hospitalization between March 1 and December 31, 2020. In-hospital death was analyzed using logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting of receiving low- or high-dose corticosteroid (dexamethasone 6-10 mg daily or >10-20 mg daily or other corticosteroid equivalents). We analyzed 13,366 patients who received low-dose and 948 who received high-dose corticosteroids, of whom 31.3% and 40.4% had severe respiratory impairment (>15 l/min of oxygen or mechanical ventilation) upon admission, respectively. There were no differences in the propensity score-adjusted odds of death (odds ratio 1.17, 95% CI 0.72-1.90) or infections (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.44-1.11) for patients who received high-dose compared with low-dose corticosteroids, beginning on the day of admission. No significant differences in subgroups stratified by severity of respiratory impairment were found. Initiating high-dose compared with low-dose corticosteroids among newly hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia did not improve survival. However, benefit of high-dose corticosteroids in specific subgroups cannot be excluded. Authors: Langer-Gould, Annette; Xu, Stanley; John L; Liu, J Infect Dis. 2022 Dec;125:184-191. Epub 2022-10-29. Characterizing Equity of Intensive Care Unit Admissions for Sepsis and Acute Respiratory Failure Rationale: Patients who identify as from racial or ethnic minority groups who have sepsis or acute respiratory failure (ARF) experience worse outcomes relative to nonminority patients, but processes of care accounting for disparities are not well-characterized. Objectives: Determine whether reductions in intensive care unit (ICU) admission during hospital-wide capacity strain occur preferentially among patients who identify with racial or ethnic minority groups. Methods: This retrospective cohort among 27 hospitals across the Philadelphia metropolitan area and Northern California between 2013 and 2018 included adult patients with sepsis and/or ARF who did not require life support at the time of hospital admission. An updated model of hospital-wide capacity strain was developed that permitted determination of relationships between patient race, ethnicity, ICU admission, and strain. Results: After adjustment for demographics, disease severity, and study hospital, patients who identified as Asian or Pacific Islander had the highest adjusted ICU admission odds relative to patients who identified as White in both the sepsis and ARF populations (odds ratio, 1.09; P = 0.006 and 1.26; P < 0.001). ICU admission was also elevated for patients with ARF who identified as Hispanic (odds ratio, 1.11; P = 0.020). Capacity strain did not modify differences in ICU admission for patients who identified with a minority group in either disease population (all interactions, P > 0.05). Conclusions: Systematic differences in ICU admission patterns were observed for patients that identified as Asian, Pacific Islander, and Hispanic. However, ICU admission was not restricted from these groups, and capacity strain did not preferentially reduce ICU admission from patients identifying with minority groups. Further characterization of provider decision-making can help contextualize these findings as the result of disparate decision-making or a mechanism of equitable care.

Bariatric Surgery and Risk of Death in Persons with Chronic Kidney Disease A retrospective cohort study investigated the association between having surgery and risk of mortality for up to 5 years and if this association was modified by incident ESRD during the follow-up period. Summary of Background Data: Mortality risk in individuals with pre-dialysis CKD is high and few effective treatment options are available. Whether bariatric surgery can improve survival in people with CKD is unclear. Patients with class II and III obesity and pre-dialysis CKD stages 3-5 who underwent bariatric surgery between January 1, 2006 and September 30, 2015 (n = 802) were matched to patients who did not have surgery (n = 4933). Mortality was obtained from state death records and ESRD was identified through state-based or healthcare system-based registries. Cox regression models were used to investigate the association between bariatric surgery and risk of mortality and if this was moderated by incident ESRD during the follow-up period. Patients were primarily women (79%), non-Hispanic White (72%), under 65 years old (64%), who had a body mass index > 40kg/m 2 (59%), diabetes (67%), and hypertension (89%). After adjusting for incident ESRD, bariatric surgery was associated with a 79% lower 5-year risk of mortality compared to matched controls (hazard ratio = 0.21; 95% confidence interval: 0.14-0.32; P < 0.001). Incident ESRD did not moderate the observed association between surgery and mortality (hazard ratio = 1.59; 95% confidence interval: 0.31-8.23; P =0.58). Bariatric surgery is associated with a reduction in mortality in pre-dialysis patients regardless of developing ESRD. These findings are significant because patients with CKD are at relatively high risk for death with few efficacious interventions available to improve survival.

The association between video or telephone telemedicine visit type and orders in primary care Telemedicine is increasingly relied upon for care delivery in primary care, but the impact of visit type on clinical ordering behavior is uncertain. Within Kaiser Permanente Northern California, we identified patients who self-scheduled and completed telemedicine encounters with their personal primary care provider or another available primary care provider in the same medical group, between April 1st, 2020, and October 31st, 2020, while physical distancing restrictions for COVID-19 were in place. We collected patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, measures of technology access, and categorized the most common primary encounter diagnoses. We measured proportions of patient-scheduled video versus telephone visits for each of eight diagnosis groups (Skin & Soft Tissue, Musculoskeletal Pain, Back Pain, General Gastrointestinal, Hypertension & Diabetes, Mental Health, Upper Respiratory, and Abdominal Pain), and compared physician orders for medications, antibiotics, lab and imaging studies by visit type within each diagnosis group. There were 273,301 included encounters, with 86,676 (41.5%) video visits and 122,051 (58.5%) telephone visits. Of the diagnosis groups, Skin & Soft Tissue conditions had the highest proportion of video visits (59.7%), while Mental Health conditions had the highest proportion of telephone visits (71.1%). After adjusting for covariates, the overall rates of medication orders (46.6% vs. 44.5%), imaging orders (17.3% vs. 14.9%), lab orders (19.5% vs. 17.2%), and antibiotic orders (7.5% vs. 5.2%) were higher during video visits as compared to telephone visits (p < 0.05). The largest difference within diagnosis groups was for Skin & Soft Tissue conditions, where the rate of medication orders was 9.1% higher than during video visits than telephone visits (45.5% vs. 36.5%, p < 0.05). We observed statistically significant differences in clinician orders by visit type during telemedicine encounters for common primary care conditions. Our findings suggest that, for certain conditions, visual information conveyed during video visits may promote clinical work-up and 19;22(1):302. Epub 2022-11-19. Prevalence of sleep-related problems and risks in a community-dwelling older adult population: a cross-sectional survey-based study Despite evidence of adverse health consequences of inadequate restorative sleep for older adults, assessment of sleep quantity, quality, and use of sleep aids is not routinely done. We aimed to characterize sleep problems, sleep risks, and advice received about sleep in a community-dwelling older adult population, overall and in subgroups with health conditions and functional difficulties. This cross-sectional study used weighted self-report data for 5074 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members aged 65-79y who responded to a 2017 or 2020 Member Health Survey. We estimated usual amount of sleep (< 6, 6 to < 7, 7 hours) and prevalence of sleep problems (frequent insomnia, frequent daytime fatigue, poor quality sleep, and potential sleep apnea (OSA) symptoms (frequent very loud snoring, apnea episodes)) for older adults overall, by self-rated health, and in subgroups reporting hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, frequent problems with balance/walking, and frequent memory problems. We also estimated percentages who regularly used sleep aids and had discussed sleep adequacy with a healthcare professional in the past year. Approximately 30% of older adults usually got less than the recommended 7 hours sleep per day, and 9% experienced frequent daytime fatigue, 13% frequent insomnia, 18% frequent insomnia/poor quality sleep, and 8% potential OSA symptoms. Prevalence of frequent insomnia was higher among women than men (16% vs. 11%). Higher percentages of those in fair/poor health and those with frequent balance/walking and memory problems reported sleeping < 6 hours per day and having all four types of sleep problems. Nearly 20% of all older adults (22% of women vs. 17% of men) and 45% of those with frequent insomnia (no sex difference) reported regular sleep aid use. Only 10% of older adults reported discussing sleep with a healthcare professional whereas > 20% reported discussing diet and exercise. Large percentages of older adults experience sleep problems or get less sleep than recommended for optimal sleep health. Older patients should routinely be assessed on multiple components of sleep health (sleep hygiene, quantity, quality, problems, and sleep aid use) and educated about sleep hygiene and the importance of getting adequate restorative sleep for their overall health and wellbeing.

Association Between Hemodialysis Timing and Postoperative Mortality in Patients With End-stage Kidney Disease For patients with end-stage kidney disease treated with hemodialysis, the optimal timing of hemodialysis prior to elective surgical procedures is unknown. To assess whether a longer interval between hemodialysis and subsequent surgery is associated with higher postoperative mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease treated with hemodialysis. Retrospective cohort study of 1 147 846 procedures among 346 828 Medicare beneficiaries with end-stage kidney disease treated with hemodialysis who underwent surgical procedures between January 1, 2011, and September 30, 2018. Follow-up ended on December 31, 2018. One-, two-, or three-day intervals between the most recent hemodialysis treatment and the surgical procedure. Hemodialysis on the day of the surgical procedure vs no hemodialysis on the day of the surgical procedure. The primary outcome was 90-day postoperative mortality. The relationship between the dialysis-to-procedure interval and the primary outcome was modeled using a Cox proportional hazards model. Of the 1 147 846 surgical procedures among 346 828 patients (median age, 65 years [IQR, 56-73 years]; 495 126 procedures [43.1%] in female patients), 750 163 (65.4%) were performed when the last hemodialysis session occurred 1 day prior to surgery, 285 939 (24.9%) when the last hemodialysis session occurred 2 days prior to surgery, and 111 744 (9.7%) when the last hemodialysis session occurred 3 days prior to surgery. Hemodialysis was also performed on the day of surgery for 193 277 procedures (16.8%). Ninety-day postoperative mortality occurred after 34 944 procedures (3.0%). Longer intervals between the last hemodialysis session and surgery were significantly associated with higher risk of 90-day mortality in a dose-dependent manner (2 days vs 1 day: absolute risk, 4.7% vs 4.2%, absolute risk difference, 0.6% [95% CI, 0.4% to 0.8%], adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.14 [95% CI, 1.10 to 1.18]; 3 days vs 1 day: absolute risk, 5.2% vs 4.2%, absolute risk difference, 1.0% [95% CI, 0.8% to 1.2%], adjusted HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.19 to 1.31]; and 3 days vs 2 days: absolute risk, 5.2% vs 4.7%, absolute risk difference, 0.4% [95% CI, 0.2% to 0.6%], adjusted HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04 to 1.13]). Undergoing hemodialysis on the same day as surgery was associated with a significantly lower hazard of mortality vs no same-day hemodialysis (absolute risk, 4.0% for same-day hemodialysis adjusted HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.91]). In the analyses that evaluated the interaction between the hemodialysis-to-procedure interval and same-day hemodialysis, undergoing hemodialysis on the day of the procedure significantly attenuated the risk associated with a longer hemodialysis-to-procedure interval (P<.001 for interaction). Among Medicare beneficiaries with end-stage kidney disease, longer intervals between hemodialysis and surgery were significantly associated with higher risk of postoperative mortality, mainly among those who did not receive hemodialysis on the day of surgery. However, the magnitude of the absolute risk differences was small, and the findings are susceptible to residual Eugene JAMA. Nov 08;328(18):1837-1848.

This cohort study was conducted using hospital admissions between January 1, 2013, and June 30, 2021, with follow-up until December 31, 2021. All medical (non-intensive care unit) admissions at an integrated health care delivery system with 21 hospitals in Northern California during the study period were included. Data were analyzed from January to June 2022. Previously reported risk factors associated with HA-VTE and administration of pharmacological prophylaxis were evaluated as factors associated with HA-VTE. Yearly incidence rates and timing of HA-VTE events overall and by subtype (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, both, or unknown), as well as readmissions and mortality rates. Among 1 112 014 hospitalizations involving 529 492 patients (268 797 [50.8%] women; 697 Black [10.0%], 79 398 Hispanic [15.0%], and 439 non-Hispanic White [58.1%]; median [IQR] age, 67.0 [54.0-79.0] years), there were 13 843 HA-VTE events (1.2% of admissions) occurring in 10 410 patients (2.0%). HA-VTE events increased from 307 of 29 095 hospitalizations (1.1%) in the first quarter of 2013 to 551 of 33 729 hospitalizations (1.6%) in the first quarter of 2021. Among all HA-VTE events, 10 746 events (77.6%) were first noted after discharge. In multivariable analyses, several factors were associated with increased odds of HA-VTE, including active cancer (adjusted odds ratio CI, 1.50-1.77). Factors associated with decreased likelihood of HA-VTE included Asian race (vs non-Hispanic White: aOR, 0.65; 95% 0.61-0.69), (aOR, 0.73; 95% CI, and 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77-0.86). HA-VTE events were of readmission (hazard ratio [HR], 3.33; 95% CI, 3.25-3.41) and mortality 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.70). This study found that HA-VTE events occurred in 1.2% of medical admissions, increased over time, and were associated with increased adverse outcomes. These findings suggest that approaches designed to mitigate occurrence and outcomes associated with HA-VTE may remain needed. (CBD) oil in the treatment of PTSD: Study design and rationale for a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial The burden of illness for PTSD is staggering and confers significant interference in work, social functioning, as well as increased risk for other physical and mental health problems. Recently, there's been considerable attention paid to the potential therapeutic use of cannabidiol (CBD) products in the treatment of a variety of physical and mental health problems. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a logical therapeutic target for combating PTSD and other fear-based disorders given that cannabinoid receptors and other molecular mediators crucial for ECS signaling are richly expressed in a variety of brain regions that govern the regulation of learned fear and defensive behavior. This is an 8-week single-site Phase II randomized double-blind placebo-controlled fixed dose clinical trial. Participants recruited throughout the United States (N = 150) meeting DSM-5 criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder are randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms: (a) 300 mg CBD Isolate; (b) 300 mg CBD Broad Spectrum; and (c) Placebo oil. The primary outcome is PTSD symptom severity as indexed by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) assessed at post treatment (Week 9) and follow-up (Week 13). Secondary outcomes including patient-rated depression, overall disability, anxiety, quality of life, and alcohol use are assessed weekly throughout the trial. Safety and CBD adherence are assessed daily throughout the trial. This is the first placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating (a) CBD for the treatment of PTSD; and (b) the first study to test the relative efficacy of CBD Isolate vs CBD Broad Spectrum.

Covid-19 Vaccination and the Timing of Surgery Following Covid-19 Infection To evaluate whether COVID-19 vaccination status or mode of anesthesia modified the temporal harms associated with surgery following coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection. Surgery shortly after COVID-19 infection is associated with higher rates of complications, leading to recommendations to delay surgery following COVID-19 infection when possible. However, prior studies were based on populations with low or no prevalence of vaccination. A retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent scheduled surgery in a health system from January 1, 2018 to February 28, 2022 (N=228,913) was performed. Patients were grouped by time of surgery relative to COVID-19 test positivity: 0 to 4 weeks after COVID-19 (\"early post-COVID-19\"), 4 to 8 weeks after COVID-19 (\"mid post-COVID-19\"), >8 weeks after COVID-19 (\"late post-COVID-19\"), surgery at least 30 days before subsequent COVID-19 (\"pre-COVID-19\"), and surgery with no prior or subsequent test positivity for COVID-19. Among patients who were not fully vaccinated at the time of COVID-19 infection, the adjusted rate of perioperative complications for the early post-COVID-19 group was significantly higher than for the pre-COVID-19 group (relative risk: 1.55; P =0.05). No significantly higher risk was identified between these groups for patients who were fully vaccinated (0.66; P =1.00), or for patients who were not fully vaccinated and underwent surgery without general anesthesia (0.52; P =0.83). Surgery shortly following COVID-19 infection was not associated with higher risks among fully vaccinated patients or among patients who underwent surgery without general anesthesia. Further research will be valuable to understand additional factors that modify perioperative risks associated with prior COVID-19 infection.

Telemedicine implementation trends in surgical specialties before and after COVID-19 shelter in place: Adjusting to a changing landscape The COVID-19 pandemic caused a shift from in-person care to telemedicine, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate trends and efficiency of telemedicine usage within surgical subspecialties in a large, integrated health care system before and after shelter in place mandates. This retrospective cohort study included all of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California members referred to surgical services from January 1, 2019 to June 13, 2020 and receiving a surgical procedure. We compared the patient referrals (categorized as benign, urgent, or cancer) before and after shelter in place mandates, and we examined rates of telemedicine (video or telephone) usage for preoperative consultations, postoperative visits, time from referral to first surgical encounter, and to surgery or procedure. In multivariate analyses, we assessed the patient and provider characteristics associated with telemedicine usage. There was a total of 34,875 surgical referrals resulting in a procedure, with a significant decline in referral after shelter in place mandates. Preoperative encounter types shifted from 89.8% in-person before shelter in place mandates to 70.2% telemedicine after shelter in place mandates (P < .0001). The median time from referral to first encounter decreased after shelter in place mandates, as did median time to procedure. After shelter in place mandates, postoperative encounters were mainly telemedicine (65.8%) compared with before shelter in place mandates (41.7%) (P < .0001). Overall, there was a comparable uptake of telemedicine usage in almost all evaluated categories of patient characteristics after shelter in place mandates. Within a health care system with prior telemedicine capability, surgical specialties were able to shift to telemedicine rapidly, equitably, and efficiently in the preoperative and postoperative encounters of benign, urgent, and cancer diagnosis during mandated COVID-19 restrictions.

Management and Outcomes of Adults Diagnosed with Acute Pulmonary Embolism in Primary Care: Community-Based Retrospective Cohort Study The management and outcomes of patients diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism in primary care have not been characterized. To describe 30-day outcomes stratified by initial site-of-care decisions DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study PARTICIPANTS: Adults diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism in primary care in a large, diverse community-based US health system (2013-2019) MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of 30-day serious adverse events (recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality). The secondary outcome was 7-day pulmonary embolism-related hospitalization, either initial or delayed. Among 652 patient encounters (from 646 patients), median age was 64 years; 51.5% were male and 70.7% identified as non-Hispanic white. Overall, 134 cases (20.6%) were sent home from primary care and 518 cases (79.4%) were initially referred to the emergency department (ED) or hospital. Among the referred, 196 (37.8%) were discharged home from the ED without events. Eight patients (1.2%; 95% CI 0.5-2.4%) experienced a 30-day serious adverse event: 4 venous thromboemboli (0.6%), 1 major bleed (0.2%), and 3 deaths (0.5%). Seven of these patients were initially hospitalized, and 1 had been sent home from primary care. All 3 deaths occurred in patients with known metastatic cancer initially referred to the ED, hospitalized, then enrolled in hospice following discharge. Overall, 328 patients (50.3%) were hospitalized within 7 days: 322 at the time of the index diagnosis and 6 following initial outpatient management (4 clinic-only and 2 clinic-plus-ED patients). Patients diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism in this primary care setting uncommonly experienced 30-day adverse events, regardless of initial site-of-care decisions. Over 20% were managed comprehensively by primary care. Delayed 7-day pulmonary embolism-related hospitalization was rare among the 51% treated as outpatients. Primary care management of acute pulmonary embolism appears to be safe and could have implications for cost-effectiveness and patient care experience.

Prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes vary by ethnicity among U.S. Asian adults at healthy weight, overweight, and obesity ranges: an electronic health record study Asian adults develop Type 2 diabetes at a lower body mass index (BMI) compared to other racial/ethnic groups. We examined the variation in prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes among Asian ethnic groups within weight strata by comparing middle-aged Chinese, Filipino, South Asian, and White adults receiving care in the same integrated healthcare delivery system. Our retrospective cross-sectional U.S. study examined data from 283,110 (non-Hispanic) White, 33,263 Chinese, 38,766 Filipino, and 17,959 South Asian adults aged 45-64 years who were members of a Northern California health plan in 2016 and had measured height and weight. Prediabetes and diabetes were classified based on laboratory data, clinical diagnoses, or diabetes pharmacotherapy. Age-standardized prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes were compared by race/ethnicity within healthy weight, overweight, and obesity categories, using standard BMI thresholds for White adults (18.5 to < 25, 25 to < 30, 30 kg/m2) and lower BMI thresholds for Asian adults (18.5 to < 23, 23 to < 27.5, 27.5 kg/m2). Prevalence ratios (PRs) were used to compare the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes for Asian groups to White adults in each weight category, adjusted for age and BMI. Across all weight categories, diabetes prevalence was higher for Asian than White adults, and among Asian groups it was highest for Filipino and South Asian adults. Compared to White, PRs for South Asian men/women at healthy BMI were 1.8/2.8 for prediabetes and 5.9/8.0 for diabetes, respectively. The PRs for Filipino men/women at healthy BMI were 1.8/2.6 for prediabetes and 5.0/7.5 for diabetes, respectively. For Chinese men/women at healthy BMI, the PRs for prediabetes (2.1/2.9) were similar to Filipino and South Asian, but the PRs for diabetes were lower (2.1/3.4). Chinese, Filipino, and South Asian adults have higher prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes than White adults in all weight categories, despite using lower BMI thresholds for weight classification in Asian groups. Within Asian ethnic groups, Filipino and South Asian adults had considerably higher diabetes prevalence than Chinese adults. Our data emphasize the disproportionate metabolic risk among middle-aged Asian adults and underscore the need for diabetes screening among high-risk Asian groups at healthy BMI levels.

Studies to quantify the breadth of antibiotic exposure across populations remain limited. Therefore, we applied a validated method to describe the breadth of antimicrobial coverage in a multicenter cohort of patients with suspected infection and sepsis. We conducted a retrospective cohort study across 21 hospitals within an integrated healthcare delivery system of patients admitted to the hospital through the ED with suspected infection or sepsis and receiving antibiotics during hospitalization from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017. We quantified the breadth of antimicrobial coverage using the Spectrum Score, a numerical score from 0 to 64, in patients with suspected infection and sepsis using electronic health record data. Of 364,506 hospital admissions through the emergency department, we identified 159,004 (43.6%) with suspected infection and 205,502 (56.4%) with sepsis. Inpatient mortality was higher among those with sepsis compared to those with suspected infection (8.4% vs 1.2%; P < .001). Patients with sepsis had higher median global Spectrum Scores (43.8 [interquartile range IQR 32.0-49.5] vs 43.5 [IQR Scores (114.0 [IQR 57.0-204.5] vs 87.5 [IQR 45.0-144.8]; P < .001) compared to those with suspected infection. Increased Spectrum Scores were associated with inpatient mortality, even after covariate adjustments (adjusted odds ratio per 10-point increase in Spectrum Score 1.31; 95%CI 1.29-1.33). Spectrum Scores quantify the variability in antibiotic breadth among individual patients, between suspected infection and sepsis populations, over the course of hospitalization, and across infection sources. They may play a key role in quantifying the variation in antibiotic prescribing in patients with suspected infection and sepsis.

Barriers and Opportunities Regarding Implementation of a Machine Learning-Based Acute Heart Failure Risk Stratification Tool in the Emergency Department Hospital admissions for patients with acute heart failure (AHF) remain high. There is an opportunity to improve alignment between patient risk and admission decision. We recently developed a machine learning (ML)-based model that stratifies emergency department (ED) patients with AHF based on predicted risk of a 30-day severe adverse event. Prior to deploying the algorithm and paired clinical decision support, we sought to understand barriers and opportunities regarding successful implementation. We conducted semi-structured interviews with eight front-line ED providers and surveyed 67 ED providers. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis, and we had a 65% response rate to the survey. Providers wanted decision support to be streamlined into workflows with minimal disruptions. Most providers wanted assistance primarily with ED disposition decisions, and secondarily with medical management and post-discharge follow-up care. Receiving feedback on patient outcomes after risk tool use was seen as an opportunity to increase acceptance, and few providers (<10%) had significant hesitations with using an ML-based tool after education on its use. Engagement with key front-line users on optimal design of the algorithm and decision support may contribute to broader uptake, acceptance, and adoption of recommendations for clinical decisions.

Current Emergency Department Disposition of Patients With Acute Heart Failure: An Opportunity for Improvement Emergency department (ED) providers play a critical role in the stabilization and diagnostic evaluation of patients presenting with acute heart failure (AHF), and EDs are key areas for establishing current best practices and future considerations for the disposition of and decision making for patients with AHF. These elements include accurate risk assessment; response to initial treatment and shared decision making concerning optimal venue of care; reframing of physicians' risk perceptions for patients presenting with AHF; exploration of alternative venues of care beyond hospitalization; population-level changes in demographics, management and outcomes of HF patients; development and testing of data-driven pathways to assist with disposition decisions in the ED; and suggested outcomes for measuring P J Card Fail. 2022 10;28(10):1545-1559.

Comparing the effectiveness of a brief intervention to reduce unhealthy alcohol use among adult primary care patients with and without depression: A machine learning approach with augmented inverse probability weighting The combination of unhealthy alcohol use and depression is associated with adverse outcomes including higher rates of alcohol use disorder and poorer depression course. Therefore, addressing alcohol use among individuals with depression may have a substantial public health impact. We compared the effectiveness of a brief intervention (BI) for unhealthy alcohol use among patients with and without depression. This observational study included 312,056 adult primary care patients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California who screened positive for unhealthy drinking between 2014 and 2017. Approximately half (48%) received a BI for alcohol use and 9% had depression. We examined 12-month changes in heavy drinking days in the previous three months, drinking days per week, drinks per drinking day, and drinks per week. Machine learning was used to estimate BI propensity, follow-up participation, and alcohol outcomes for an augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) estimator of the average treatment (BI) effect. This approach does not depend on the strong parametric assumptions of traditional logistic regression, making it more robust to model misspecification. BI had a significant effect on each alcohol use outcome in the non-depressed subgroup (-0.41 to -0.05, all ps < .003), but not in the depressed subgroup (-0.33 to -0.01, all ps > .28). However, differences between subgroups were nonsignificant (0.00 to 0.11, all ps > .44). On average, BI is an effective approach to reducing unhealthy drinking, but more research is necessary to understand its impact on patients with depression. AIPW with machine learning provides a robust method for comparing intervention effectiveness across subgroups.

Identifying modifiable obesogenic behaviors among Latino adolescents in primary pediatric care. Latino adolescents engage in more obesogenic behaviors, including sedentary behaviors and sugary drink consumption, than White adolescents. However, it is unclear whether engagement in obesogenic behaviors differs within the Latino population. Cross-sectional data were examined from Latino adolescents ages 13-17 with a well-child visit (2016-2019) in an integrated healthcare system. Adolescents self-reported on four daily obesogenic behaviors: 1) consuming < 5 servings of fruits/vegetables; 2) drinking > 1 juice/soda; 3) exercising/playing sports < 60 min; and 4) > 2 h screen time. A composite variable of >/= 3 self-reported behaviors was constructed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between obesogenic behaviors with age category (13-15 or 16-17 years), sex, household language preference (English/Spanish), neighborhood deprivation index (NDI quartiles), and body mass index (BMI). Among 77,514 Latino adolescents (mean age 14.7 +/- 1.4; 50 % female), 23 % lived in Spanish-speaking households, 43 % resided in census tracts with the highest (most deprived) NDI quartile, and 45 % had an overweight or obese BMI. Older (vs younger) adolescents had higher odds of insufficient fruit/vegetable intake (OR 1.20; CI 1.17-1.24), greater sedentary behavior (OR 1.51; 1.46-1.56), and reporting > 2 h screen time (OR 1.07; 1.03-1.11). Adolescents in the 4th (vs 1st) NDI quartile (OR 1.34; 1.26-1.42) and those with obesity (vs healthy weight) (OR 1.55; 1.42-1.70 for class 3 obesity) had higher odds of >/= 3 obesogenic behaviors. In conclusion, among Latino adolescents, older age, obesity, and living in more deprived neighborhoods were associated with greater obesogenic behaviors. Identifying adolescents more likely to engage in obesogenic behaviors can inform targeted lifestyle Health Records We develop an unsupervised probabilistic model for heterogeneous Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Utilizing a mixture model formulation, our approach directly models sequences of arbitrary length, such as medications and laboratory results. This allows for subgrouping and incorporation of the dynamics underlying heterogeneous data types. The model consists of a layered set of latent variables that encode underlying structure in the data. These variables represent subject subgroups at the top layer, and unobserved states for sequences in the second layer. We train this model on episodic data from subjects receiving medical care in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated healthcare delivery system. The resulting properties of the trained model generate novel insight from these complex and multifaceted data. In addition, we show how the model can be used to analyze sequences that contribute to assessment of mortality likelihood.

Strategies Facilitating Video Visit Implementation by a Medical Group Serving a Diverse Population IntroductionVideo visits have created new opportunities to enhance access to care, but limited information exists on strategies medical groups can employ to facilitate video visit use by higher-risk patients. Our objective was to identify generalizable strategies to facilitate successful delivery of video visits by systems serving highly diverse patient populations. MethodsThe authors conducted a qualitative study of physicians and staff members in a large group practice with 4.5 million patients with diverse race and ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Semi-structured interviews were conducted between January 2021 and April 2021, with key informants identified via purposive and snowball sampling. Video-recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis to identify major themes and subthemes. ResultsThe 42 key informants included regional and medical center leaders, primary care physicians, service managers, and medical assistants. Participants described clinical leadership in technology and multidisciplinary collaboration as crucial to sustained video care adoption. Strategies to facilitate real-time learning included local innovation, rapid communication channels, and psychological safety. The organization offered broad access to frequently updated data reports to help managers and practitioners understand processes, measure performance, and share best practices. Medical assistants and physicians developed new approaches to empathize, tailor interactions with patients, and overcome psychological and technical barriers to connecting via video. ConclusionsKey strategies for sustained video care adoption included clinical leadership articulating its purpose, multidisciplinary collaboration, local innovation, effective data use, empathy, and personalized care. These findings provide a model for how health care systems can foster robust adoption of technologies to serve diverse populations. Authors: Lieu, Tracy J. Sep 14;26(3):20-29. Epub 2022-07-20. Improving outcomes in malignant pleural mesothelioma in an integrated health care system Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive tumor that should be managed by an experienced surgical and multidisciplinary group. Our objective was to determine the impact of proficient surgeons and MPM bi-disciplinary review on outcomes of patients with MPM. Through this cohort study, electronic medical records of 368 adult patients with MPM from 1/1/2009 to 12/31/2020 were reviewed and compared before and after MPM surgeries were regionalized to specialized surgeons and bi-disciplinary review of MPM patient treatment options. We used the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests to compare survival rates by period, by treatment type, and by stage. Patients were followed from cancer diagnosis date until they died or end of study follow-up, whichever occurred first. We also conducted Cox proportional hazards regression model to examine the overall survival (OS) with adjustments for age, histology, stage, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Despite similar staging, more patients received any MPM directed treatment from 2015-2020 compared with those patients from 2009-2014. Specifically, there was an increase in patients who received pleurectomy/decortication (PD) from 2015-2020 compared to those who received PD in 2009-2014. Patients with similar age, CCI, stage, and histology had an increase in OS of 12 months with multimodality therapy (surgery, systemic therapy, +/- radiation) compared to those patients who received no treatment. Consolidating mesothelioma surgery to a specialized surgical team and regular bi-disciplinary review of MPM cases to determine appropriate multimodality therapy, increases the incorporation of surgical treatments in the management of patients with MPM.

Primary Care Visits Are Timelier When Patients Choose Telemedicine: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study Introduction: Telemedicine could increase timely access to primary care-a key dimension of care quality. Methods: Among patient-scheduled appointments with their own primary care providers using the online portal in a large integrated health care delivery system, we measured the association between visit type (telemedicine or in-person) and appointment timeliness. We calculated the calendar days between the scheduling date and the actual appointment time. Results: Overall, 2,178,440 primary care visits were scheduled and 14% were done through telemedicine. The mean calendar days between the scheduling and the appointment time were 1.80 for telephone visits, 2.29 for video visits, and 3.52 for in-person visits. After multivariate adjustment, 66.61% (confidence 46.42-46.57) of in-person visits were scheduled to occur within 1 day of making the appointment. Conclusions: In a setting with comparable in-person and telemedicine scheduling availability, choosing telemedicine was associated with more timely access to primary Graetz, Ilana; Sep;28(9):1374-1378.

Ovarian Cystadenomas: Growth Rate and Reliability of Imaging Measurements To evaluate the growth rate of benign ovarian cystadenomas and the degree of variability in ultrasound measurements. Two independent retrospective cohorts of women found to have benign cystadenomas at surgery were identified. To assess growth rate, ultrasounds on women in a community-based health system were reviewed and the growth rate was determined based on the maximum reported size dimension using a mixed effect model. To assess measurement variability, two radiologists independently measured presurgical adnexal imaging findings for women in a tertiary care referral setting. Interobserver, intra-observer, and intermodality (cine clip versus still images) variability in measurements was determined using correlation coefficients (CC) and Bland-Altman analysis, with the proportion of measurements varying by more than 1 cm calculated. For growth rate assessment, 405 women with 1412 ultrasound examinations were identified. The median growth rate was 0.65 cm/year with mucinous cystadenomas growing faster for serous cystadenomas (median test P < .0001). To evaluate measurement variability, 75 women were identified with 176 ultrasound studies. The within-subject standard deviations for ultrasound measurements were 0.74 cm for cine clip images and 0.41 cm for static images, with 11% of measurements overall differing by more than 1 cm. Cystadenomas grow on average 0.65 cm/year, which is similar in magnitude to the inherent error observed in measurement on ultrasound, suggesting that repeat ultrasound at intervals of longer than a year will often be needed to accurately assess growth if a cyst represents a benign J Ultrasound Med. 2022 Sep;41(9):2157-2167.

Prior exposure to endemic coronaviruses, common in young children, may protect against SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated risk of severe COVID-19 among adults with and without exposure to young children in a large, integrated healthcare system. Adults with children 0-5 years were matched 1:1 to adults with children 6-11 years, 12-18 years, and those without children based upon a COVID-19 propensity score and risk factors for severe COVID-19. COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and need for intensive care unit (ICU) were assessed in 3,126,427 adults, of whom 24% (N = 743,814) had children 18 years or younger, and 8.8% (N = 274,316) had a youngest child 0-5 years. After 1:1 matching, propensity for COVID-19 infection and risk factors for severe COVID-19 were well balanced between groups. Rates of COVID-19 infection were slightly higher for adults with exposure to older children (incident risk ratio, 1.09, 95% confidence interval, [1.05-1.12] and IRR 1.09 [1.05-1.13] for adults with children 6-11 and 12-18, respectively), compared to those with children 0-5 years, although no difference in rates of COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization or ICU admission was observed. However, adults without exposure to children had lower rates of COVID-19 infection (IRR 0.85, [0.83-0.87]) but significantly higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalization (IRR 1.49, [1.29-1.73]) and hospitalization requiring ICU admission (IRR 1.76, [1.19-2.58]) compared to those with children aged 0-5. In a large, real-world population, exposure to young children was associated with less severe COVID-19 illness. Endemic coronavirus cross-immunity may play a role in protection against severe COVID-19. Authors: Solomon, Matthew D; Escobar, S A. 2022 Aug 16;119(33):e2204141119. Epub 2022-07-27. The Kaiser Permanente Northern California Advance Alert Monitor Program: An Automated Early Warning System for Adults at Risk for In-Hospital Clinical Deterioration In-hospital deterioration among ward patients is associated with substantially increased adverse outcome rates. In 2013 Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) developed and implemented a predictive analytics-driven program, Advance Alert Monitor (AAM), to improve early detection and intervention for in-hospital deterioration. The AAM predictive model is designed to give clinicians 12 hours of lead time before clinical deterioration, permitting early detection and a patient goals-concordant response to prevent worsening. Across the 21 hospitals of the KPNC integrated health care delivery system, AAM analyzes electronic health record (EHR) data for patients in medical/surgical and telemetry units 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Patients identified as high risk by the AAM algorithm trigger an alert for a regional team of experienced critical care virtual quality nurse consultants (VQNCs), who then cascade validated, actionable information to rapid response team (RRT) nurses at local hospitals. RRT nurses conduct bedside assessments of at-risk patients and formulate interdisciplinary clinical responses with hospital-based physicians, bedside nurses, and supportive care teams to ensure a well-defined escalation plan that includes clarification of the patients' goals of care. Since 2019 the AAM program has been implemented at all 21 KPNC hospitals. The use of predictive modeling embedded within the EHR to identify high-risk patients has produced the standardization of monitoring workflows, clinical rescue protocols, and coordination to ensure that care is consistent with patients' individual goals of care. An evaluation of the program, using a staggered deployment sequence over 19 hospitals, demonstrates that the AAM program is associated with statistically significant decreases in mortality (9.8% vs. 14.4%), hospital length of stay, and ICU length of stay. Statistical analyses estimated that more than 500 deaths were prevented each year with the AAM program. Unlocking the potential of predictive modeling in the EHR is the first step toward realizing the promise of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) to improve health outcomes. The AAM program leveraged predictive analytics to produce highly reliable care by identifying at-risk patients, preventing deterioration, and reducing adverse outcomes and can be used as a model for how clinical decision support and inpatient population management can effectively improve care.

Associations Between Different Self-reported Social Risks and Neighborhood-level Resources in Medicaid Patients Adverse social conditions are a key contributor to health disparities. Improved understanding of how social risk factors interact with each other and with neighborhood characteristics may inform efforts to reduce health disparities. A questionnaire of 29,281 patients was collected through the enrollment of Medicaid beneficiaries in a large Northern California integrated health care delivery system between May 2016 and February 2020. Living in the least resourced quartile of neighborhoods as measured by a census-tract level Neighborhood Deprivation Index score. Five self-reported social risk factors: financial need, food insecurity, housing barriers, transportation barriers, and functional limitations. Nearly half (42.0%) of patients reported at least 1 social risk factor; 22.4% reported 2 or more. Mean correlation coefficient between social risk factors was =0.30. Multivariable logistic models controlling for age, race/ethnicity, sex, count of chronic conditions, and insurance source estimated that living in the least resourced neighborhoods was associated with greater odds of food insecurity (adjusted odds ratio=1.07, 95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.13) (adjusted odds ratio=1.20, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.30), but not financial stress, housing barriers, or functional limitations. We found that among 5 commonly associated social risk factors, Medicaid patients in a large Northern California health system typically reported only a single factor and that these factors did not correlate strongly with each other. We found only modestly greater social risk reported by patients in the least resourced neighborhoods. These results suggest that individual-level interventions should be targeted to specific needs whereas community-level interventions may be similarly important across diverse neighborhoods.

Impact of cannabidiol-rich disruption of naturalistic interoceptive aversive memory in humans: Protocol for a randomized clinical trial Preclinical experiments with rodents demonstrate that cannabidiol (CBD), the non-psychotomimetic constituent of the Cannabis sativa plant, disrupts reconsolidation of aversive memories conditioned in the laboratory when administered within the memory reconsolidation window (< 6 h. post-retrieval) by indirectly activating cannabinoid (CB1) receptors in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Based on these findings, we aim to test whether administration of 300 mg CBD-rich hemp extract oil following fear reactivation of an aversive interoceptive threat memory can disrupt reconsolidation of naturalistic aversive memories in humans. More specifically, naturalistic interoceptive aversive memories, a form of transdiagnostic fear memory that contributes to the pathogenesis of fear-related disorders such as panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and illness anxiety disorder. For this proof-of-concept, placebo-controlled double-blind trial, volunteers (n = 99) reporting elevated fears of somatic sensations will be stratified on biological sex and randomized to one of three intervention arms: (a). CBD-rich oil administered within the reconsolidation window, (b) Placebo oil administered within the reconsolidation window; or (c) CBD-rich oil administered outside of the reconsolidation window. Change in emotional reactivity to a 35% CO2 challenge from baseline to two-week follow-up will serve as our primary outcome. Study findings may contribute towards the development of a novel brief transdiagnostic intervention guided by reconsolidation theory for individuals prone to Trends in Antimicrobial Prescribing During Hospitalization for Potential Infection and Sepsis Some experts have cautioned that national and health system emphasis on rapid administration of antimicrobials for sepsis may increase overall antimicrobial use even among patients without sepsis. To assess whether temporal changes in antimicrobial timing for sepsis are associated with increasing antimicrobial use, days of therapy, or broadness of antimicrobial coverage among all hospitalized patients at risk for sepsis. This is an observational cohort study of hospitalized patients at 152 hospitals in 2 health care systems during 2013 to 2018, admitted via the emergency department with 2 or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Data analysis was performed from June 10, 2021, to March 22, 2022. Hospital-level temporal trends in time to first antimicrobial administration. Antimicrobial outcomes included antimicrobial use, days of therapy, and broadness of antibacterial coverage. Clinical outcomes included in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, length of hospitalization, and new multidrug-resistant (MDR) organism culture positivity. Among 1 559 523 patients admitted to the hospital via the emergency department with 2 or more SIRS criteria (1 269 998 male patients [81.4%]; median [IQR] age, 67 [59-77] years), 273 255 (17.5%) met objective criteria for sepsis. In multivariable models adjusted for patient characteristics, the adjusted median (IQR) time to first antimicrobial administration to patients with sepsis decreased by 37 minutes, from 4.7 (4.1-5.3) hours in 2013 to 3.9 (3.6-4.4) hours in 2018, although the slope of decrease varied across hospitals. During the same period, antimicrobial use within 48 hours, days of antimicrobial therapy, and receipt of broad-spectrum coverage decreased among the broader cohort of patients with SIRS. In-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, length of hospitalization, new MDR culture positivity, and new MDR blood culture positivity decreased over the study period among both patients with sepsis and those with SIRS. When examining hospital-specific trends, decreases in antimicrobial use, days of therapy, and broadness of antibacterial coverage for patients with SIRS did not differ by hospital antimicrobial timing trend for sepsis. Overall, there was no evidence that accelerating antimicrobial timing for sepsis was associated with increasing antimicrobial use or impaired antimicrobial stewardship. In this multihospital cohort study, the time to first antimicrobial for sepsis decreased over time, but this trend was not associated with increasing antimicrobial use, days of therapy, or broadness of antimicrobial coverage among the broader population at-risk for sepsis, which suggests that shortening the time to antibiotics for sepsis is feasible without leading to indiscriminate antimicrobial use.

Adults hospitalized with breakthrough COVID-19 have lower mortality than matched unvaccinated adults Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) breakthrough infections are common. Evaluate in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 by vaccination status using retrospective cohort study. We generated propensity scores for receipt of full vaccination in adults requiring supplemental oxygen hospitalized at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (1 April 2021 to 30 November 2021) with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction tests. Optimal matching of fully vaccinated/unvaccinated patients was performed comparing in-hospital mortality. Of 7305 patients, 1463 (20.0%) were full, 138 (1.9%) were partial, and 5704 (78.1%) were unvaccinated. Fully vaccinated were older than partial or unvaccinated (71.0, 63.0, and 54.0 years, respectively, p < 0.001) comorbidities (Comorbidity Point Scores (2.8%, 0.7%, and 0.4%, p < 0.001). Fewer fully vaccinated patients died compared to matched unvaccinated (9.0% vs. 16.3%, p < 0.0001). Fully vaccinated patients are less likely to die compared to matched unvaccinated patients.

Reach, acceptability, and perceived success of a telehealth diabetes prevention program among racially and ethnically diverse patients with gestational diabetes: the GEM cluster-randomized trial Patients with gestational diabetes mellitus and from racial/ethnic minority groups face disproportionate risk for type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle interventions, if accessible and acceptable to diverse patients, could advance diabetes prevention and mitigate racial/ethnic disparities. Here we describe overall and race/ethnicity-specific reach, acceptability, and perceived success from an effective telehealth diabetes prevention lifestyle program for patients with gestational diabetes mellitus, implemented in the Gestational Diabetes Effects on Moms (GEM) cluster-randomized controlled trial. GEM tested a program of 13 telephone sessions and behavior change techniques (BCTs, e.g., goal setting) in a healthcare system. We evaluated participation (completing 1 session), acceptability of BCTs, and perceived success reaching program goals. Among 1,087 patients (75.2% from minority groups), 50.3% participated. Participation rates were 61.7% among Black, 56.4% among Hispanic, 55.6% among multiracial/other, 53.0% among White, and 43.7% among Asian/Pacific Islander patients. Evaluation survey respondents (n = 433/547; 79.2%) largely rated BCTs as very helpful (range 40.9%-58.4%) or moderately helpful (27.3%-34.9%). Respondents from minority groups largely rated goal setting for weight management as very or moderately helpful, with fewer minority respondents rating it as only a little/not at all helpful than White respondents (p = .02). Black and White respondents reported more limited success reaching a healthy weight than Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and multiracial/other women (p = .005). A telehealth diabetes prevention lifestyle program demonstrated reach and acceptability across racial/ethnic groups. While perceived success can be improved among Black and White participants, such programs could promote access to preventive care and help mitigate disparities in diabetes risk. Authors: Brown, Susan D; Hedderson, inpatient physical function assessment: matched clinician-report and patient-report short form measures from the PROMIS adult physical function item bank To develop two item content-matched, precise, score-level targeted inpatient physical function (PF) short form (SF) measures: one clinician-reported, one patient-reported. Items were derived from PROMIS PF bank content; scores are reported on the PROMIS PF T-score metric. The PROMIS PF item bank for content measuring lower-level PF status (T-scores 10-50) with high item set score-level reliability ( 0.90). Selected patient-reported (PR) items were also edited to function as clinician-reported (CR) items. Items were reviewed by clinicians and field tested; responses were assessed for meeting PROMIS measure development standards. New CR and PR items were calibrated using patient responses to the original PROMIS PF items as anchoring data. SFs were constructed, based on content and precision. Nine PROMIS PF items were candidates for CR and PR inpatient PF assessment; three new items were written to extend content coverage. An inpatient sample (N = 515; 55.1% female; mean age = 66.2 years) completed 12 PR items and was assessed by physical therapists (using 12 CR items). Analyses indicated item sets met expected measure development standards. Twelve new CR and three new PR items were linked to the PROMIS PF metric (raw score r = 0.73 and 0.90, respectively). A 5-item CR SF were 0.90 for T-scores 13-45. A 5-item PR SF measure was assembled, mirroring CR SF content.

Red Blood Cell Transfusion at a Hemoglobin Threshold of Seven g/dL in Critically Ill Patients: A Regression Discontinuity Study Rationale: In critically ill patients, a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of <7.0 g/dl compared with <10.0 g/dl improves organ dysfunction. However, it is unclear if transfusion at a hemoglobin of <7.0 g/dl is superior to no transfusion. Objectives: To compare degrees of organ dysfunction between transfusion and no transfusion at a hemoglobin threshold of <7.0 g/dl among critically ill patients using quasiexperimental regression discontinuity methods. Methods: We performed regression discontinuity analysis using hemoglobin measurements from patients admitted to intensive care units in three cohorts (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, eICU, and Premier Inc.), estimating the change in organ dysfunction (modified sequential organ failure assessment score) in the 24- to 72-hour window following each hemoglobin measurement. We compared hemoglobin concentrations just above and below 7.0 g/dl using a \"fuzzy\" discontinuity approach, based on the concept that measurement noise pseudorandomizes similar hemoglobin concentrations on either side of the transfusion threshold. Results: A total of 11,181, 13,664, and 167,142 patients were included in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV), eICU, and Premier Inc. cohorts, respectively. Patient characteristics below the threshold did not differ from those above the threshold, except that crossing below the threshold resulted in a >20% absolute increase in transfusion rates in all three cohorts. Transfusion was associated with increases in hemoglobin concentration in the subsequent 24-72 hours (MIMIC-IV, 2.4 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1 to g/dl; eICU, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.3 to 1.2] Inc., 1.9 [95% CI, 1.5 to 2.2] g/dl) but not with improvement in organ dysfunction (MIMIC-IV, [95% CI, -1.2 to Inc., 1.1 [95% CI, -0.2 to 2.3] points) compared with no transfusion. Conclusions: Transfusion was not associated with improved organ dysfunction compared with no transfusion at a hemoglobin threshold of 7.0 g/dl, suggesting that evaluation of transfusion targets other than a hemoglobin threshold of 7.0 g/dl may be warranted.

Validation of Respiratory Rate-Oxygenation Index in Patients With COVID-19-Related Respiratory Failure The respiratory rate-oxygenation (ROX) index is a fraction of oxygen saturation, Fio2, and respiratory rate that has been validated to predict receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients receiving high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). This study aimed to validate ROX in a cohort of inpatients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure. Retrospective validation of the ROX index. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and 95% CIs of ROX for invasive mechanical ventilation any time during hospitalization. Twenty-one hospitals of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated healthcare delivery system. We identified adults with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction test within 3 weeks of, or during, hospitalization between February 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. We calculated ROX at 12 hours after HFNC initiation. We grouped patients as low ( 4.88), intermediate (< 4.88 and 3.85), or high (< 3.85) risk using previously published thresholds. None. We identified 1,847 patients who had no limitation of life support. Of these, 525 (31.7%) received invasive mechanical ventilation any time during hospitalization and 511 died (27.7%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 12-hour ROX threshold (< 3.85) predicting invasive mechanical ventilation were (95% 71.8-76.3%), respectively. The 12-hour ROX index has a positive predictive value (59.4%) using threshold of less than 3.85 for COVID-19 patients needing invasive mechanical ventilation. Our health system has embedded ROX into the electronic health record to prioritize rounding during periods of inpatient surge. Authors: 2022 07 01;50(7):e638-e642. Epub 2022-02-07. Address Changes Are Associated With Unmet Glycemic Targets: Opportunities to Improve Processes and Outcomes of Care Among People With Type 2 Diabetes Introduction The objective of this study was to identify and operationalize measures of potential housing insecurity within existing electronic health record data and to quantify the association between address changes and diabetes management goals among patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study to measure potential housing insecurity in electronic health record data by quantifying the number of address changes in 2018. We considered at least one address change as a potential marker for housing insecurity. We used multivariable modified Poisson regressions to analyze the association between address change and clinical, utilization and preventive care outcomes while adjusting for patient and health system factors. Results We identified 274,123 adults with type 2 diabetes who were members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2018 and 6% (N = 17,317) had at least one address change during 2018. In multivariate analyses, we found that one or more address changes was associated with greater chance of hemoglobin A1C < 9 (ARR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.15), lower of < 8 (ARR: 0.95, 95% CI; 0.94, 0.96), pressure (ARR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-0.99), greater chance of emergency department visits (ARR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.27), and lower chance of having a flu shot (ARR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.93, 0.95) when compared to no address change. Discussion Changes in address are associated with worse diabetes management outcomes. Conclusion Identifying patients with potential housing insecurity and providing resources aimed at continuity of care and stable health care access could improve diabetes management for vulnerable populations. Authors: Thomas, Tainayah; Dyer, Wendy; emergency department opioid prescribing The opioid abuse epidemic has focused attention on efforts to decrease opioid prescribing. Although education and feedback interventions are potential levers to affect opioid prescribing, their incremental contribution against a background of declining opioid prescriptions is unclear. We retrospectively evaluated opioid prescribing frequencies after an emergency physician-specific education and feedback initiative in an integrated health care system. We evaluated opioid prescriptions for adult patients discharged from 21 emergency departments (EDs) between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. Applying interrupted time series methodology to account for time trends, we analyzed pre- to postintervention changes in prescribing of any opioid and in opioid prescriptions for greater than 20 tablets. We studied all ED visits, visits for back pain and acute extremity fracture, and visits stratified by physicians with high vs low frequency of opioid prescribing. We identified patient, physician, and visit characteristics associated with postintervention ED opioid prescriptions (2018). Of 1.01 million preintervention and 1.59 million postintervention ED visits, after adjusting for the background trend over time, the intervention was associated with a 3.4% decrease in frequency of opioid prescriptions post intervention (95% CI, -4% to -2.8%), with similar decreases in high-quantity prescriptions (> 20 tablets) and back pain- and acute extremity fracture-related ED visits. Postintervention adjusted analyses indicated no significant association between opioid prescription and race/ethnicity or prior history of opioid abuse. The ED Opioid Safety Initiative was associated with a near-term decrease in multiple categories of opioid prescribing, including for selected subgroups of common Jun 01;28(6):e203-e211.

Psychosocial and factors among racially/ethnically diverse adults with prediabetes Psychosocial factors such as self-efficacy may be important in helping high-risk adults prevent diabetes. We aimed to describe psychosocial and diabetes risk factors in adults with prediabetes and evaluate if these varied by demographic characteristics. Cross-sectional data came from baseline surveys and electronic health records (2018-2021) of adults with prediabetes enrolled in a randomized study of peer support for diabetes prevention at Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Michigan Medicine. Linear regression was used to compare differences between racial/ethnic groups, adjusting for age, sex, and clinic. Of 336 participants in the study, 62% were female; median age was 57; 41% were White, 35% African American, 9% Hispanic. Mean autonomous motivation was 6.6 and self-efficacy to prevent diabetes was 6.0 (1-7 scale); mean perceived social support was 47 (12-72 scale). Hispanic adults reported higher autonomous motivation and African American adults reported higher self-efficacy compared to White adults. Hispanic and African American adults had more diabetes risk factors than White adults, including greater family history of diabetes, hypertension, sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, physical inactivity and food insecurity. In conclusion, participants reported high levels of autonomous motivation and self-efficacy at baseline, with Hispanic and African American adults reporting higher levels of some psychosocial factors related to behavior change, suggesting a significant opportunity to engage a diverse population of adults with prediabetes in diabetes prevention strategies. However, Hispanic and African American participants showed greater diabetes risk factors levels. Diabetes prevention efforts should address both to reduce diabetes incidence.

Risk adjusted 30-day mortality and serious adverse event rates among a large, multi-center cohort of emergency department patients with acute heart failure Admission rates for emergency department (ED) patients with acute heart failure (AHF) remain elevated. Use of a risk stratification tool could improve disposition decision making by identifying low-risk patients who may be safe for outpatient management. We performed a secondary analysis of a retrospective, multi-center cohort of 26,189 ED patients treated for AHF from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018. We applied a 30-day risk model we previously developed and grouped patients into 4 categories (low, low/moderate, moderate, and high) of predicted 30-day risk of a serious adverse event (SAE). SAE consisted of death or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), intra-aorta balloon pump, endotracheal intubation, renal failure requiring dialysis, or acute coronary syndrome. We measured the 30-day mortality and composite SAE rates among patients by risk category according to ED disposition: direct discharge, discharge after observation, and hospital admission. The observed 30-day mortality and total SAE rates were less than 1% and 2%, respectively, among 25% of patients in the low and low/moderate risk groups. These rates did not vary significantly by ED disposition. An additional 23% of patients were moderate risk and experienced an approximate 2% 30-day mortality rate. Use of a risk stratification tool could help identify lower risk AHF patients who may be appropriate for ED discharge. These findings will help inform prospective testing to determine how this risk tool can augment ED decision making. Emerg Open. Epub 2022-06-09.

Higher intensity of 72-hour non-invasive cardiac test referral does not improve short-term outcomes among emergency department patients with chest pain It is unclear whether referral for cardiac noninvasive testing (NIT) following emergency department (ED) chest pain encounters improves short-term outcomes. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients presenting with chest pain, without ST-elevation myocardial infarction or myocardial injury by serum troponin testing, between 2013 and 2019 to 21 EDs within an integrated health care system. We examined the association between NIT referral (within 72 h of the ED encounter) and a primary outcome of 60-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Secondary outcomes were 60-day MACE without coronary revascularization (MACE-CR) and 60-day all-cause mortality. To account for confounding by indication for NIT, we grouped patient encounters into ranked tertiles of NIT referral intensity based on the likelihood of 72-h NIT referral associated with the initially assigned emergency physician, relative to local peers and within discrete time periods. Associations between NIT referral-intensity tertile and outcomes were assessed using risk-adjusted multivariable logistic regression. Among 210,948 eligible patient encounters, 72-h NIT referral frequency was 11.9%, 18.3%, and 25.9% in low, intermediate, and high NIT referral-intensity encounters, respectively. Compared with the low referral-intensity tertile, there was a higher risk of 60-day MACE within the high referral-intensity tertile (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04 to 1.17) due to more coronary revascularizations without corresponding differences in MACE-CR or all-cause mortality. In analyses stratified by patients' estimated risk (HEART score; 50.5% lower risk, 38.7% moderate risk, 10.8% higher risk), the difference in 60-day MACE was primarily attributable to moderate-risk encounters (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.24), with no differences among either lower- (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.31) or higher- (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.90 to 1.14) risk encounters. Higher referral intensity for 72-h NIT was associated with higher risk of coronary revascularization but no difference in adverse events within 60 days. These findings further call into question the urgency of NIT among ED patients without objective evidence of myocardial injury. Authors: Emerg Med. 2022 06;29(6):736-747. Epub 2022-02-23. Exploratory analysis of novel electronic health record variables for quantification of healthcare delivery strain, prediction of mortality, and prediction of imminent discharge To explore the relationship between novel, time-varying predictors for healthcare delivery strain (eg, counts of patient orders per hour) and imminent discharge and in-hospital mortality. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from adults hospitalized at 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals between November 1, 2015 and October 31, 2020 and the nurses caring for them. Patient data extracted included demographics, diagnoses, severity measures, occupancy metrics, and process of care metrics (eg, counts of intravenous drip orders per hour). We linked these data to individual registered nurse records and created multiple dynamic, time-varying predictors (eg, mean acute severity of illness for all patients cared for by a nurse during a given hour). All analyses were stratified by patients' initial hospital unit (ward, stepdown unit, or intensive care unit). We used discrete-time hazard regression to assess the association between each novel time-varying predictor and the outcomes of discharge and mortality, separately. Our dataset consisted of 84 162 161 hourly records from 954 477 hospitalizations. Many novel time-varying predictors had strong associations with the 2 study outcomes. However, most of the predictors did not merely track patients' severity of illness; instead, many of them only had weak correlations with severity, often with complex relationships over time. Increasing availability of process of care data from automated electronic health records will permit better quantification of healthcare delivery strain. This could result in enhanced prediction of adverse outcomes and service delays. New conceptual models will be needed to use these new data elements.

Sustainability of a Clinical Decision Support Intervention for Outpatient Care for Emergency Department Patients With Acute Pulmonary Embolism Physicians commonly hospitalize patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), despite eligibility for safe outpatient management. Risk stratification using electronic health record-embedded clinical decision support systems can aid physician site-of-care decision-making and increase safe outpatient management. The long-term sustainability of early improvements after the cessation of trial-based, champion-led promotion is uncertain. To evaluate the sustainability of recommended site-of-care decision-making support 4 years after initial physician champion-led interventions to increase outpatient management for patients with acute PE. This retrospective cohort study was conducted in 21 US community hospitals in an integrated health system. Participants included adult patients presenting to the ED with acute PE. Study sites had participated in an original decision-support intervention trial 4 years prior to the current study period: 10 sites were intervention sites, 11 sites were controls. In that trial, decision support with champion promotion resulted in significantly higher outpatient management at intervention sites compared with controls. After trial completion, all study sites were given continued access to a modified decision-support tool without further champion-led outreach. Data were analyzed from January 2019 to February 2020. ED treatment with a modified clinical decision support tool. The main outcome was frequency of outpatient management, defined as discharge home directly from the ED, stratified by the PE Severity Index. The safety measure of outpatient care was 7-day PE-related hospitalization. This study included 1039 patients, including 533 (51.3%) women, with a median (IQR) age of 65 (52-74) years. Nearly half (474 patients [45.6%]) were rated lower risk on the PE Severity Index. Overall, 278 patients (26.8%) were treated as outpatients, with only four 7-day PE-related hospitalizations (1.4%; 95% CI, 0.4%-3.6%). The practice gap in outpatient management created by the earlier trial persisted in the outpatient management for patients with lower risk: 109 of 236 patients (46.2%) at former intervention sites vs 81 of 238 patients (34.0%) at former control sites (difference, 12.2; [95% CI, 3.4-20.9] percentage points; P = .007), with wide interfacility variation (range, 7.1%-47.1%). In this cohort study, a champion-led, decision-support intervention to increase outpatient management for patients presenting to the ED with acute pulmonary embolism was associated with sustained higher rates of outpatient management 4 years later. The application of our findings to improving sustainability of practice change for other clinical conditions warrants further study.

Association Between High-Deductible Health Plans and Engagement in Routine Medical Care for Type 2 Diabetes in a Privately Insured Population: A Propensity Score-Matched Study High-deductible health plans (HDHPs) are increasingly more common but can be challenging for patients to navigate and may negatively affect care engagement for chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes. We sought to understand how higher out-of-pocket costs affect participation in provider visits, medication adherence, and routine monitoring by patients with type 2 diabetes with an HDHP. In a retrospective cohort of 19,379 Kaiser Permanente Northern California patients with type 2 diabetes (age 18-64 years), 6,801 patients with an HDHP were compared with those with a no-deductible plan using propensity score matching. We evaluated the number of telephone and office visits with primary care, oral diabetic medication adherence, and rates of HbA1c testing, blood pressure monitoring, and retinopathy screening. Patients with an HDHP had fewer primary care office visits compared with patients with no deductible (4.25 vs. 4.85 visits per person; P < 0.001), less retinopathy screening (49.9% vs. 53.3%; P < 0.001), and fewer A1c and blood pressure measurements (46.7% vs. 51.4%; P < 0.001 and 93.2% vs. 94.4%; P = 0.004, respectively) compared with the control group. Medication adherence was not significantly different between patients with an HDHP and those with no deductible (57.4% vs. 58.6%; P = 0.234). HDHPs seem to be a barrier for patients with type 2 diabetes and reduce care participation in both visits with out-of-pocket costs and preventive care without out-of-pocket costs, possibly because of the increased complexity of cost sharing under an HDHP, potentially leading to decreased monitoring of important clinical measurements.

Comparison of Electronic Frailty Metrics for Prediction of Adverse Outcomes of Abdominal Surgery Electronic frailty metrics have been developed for automated frailty assessment and include the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), the Electronic Frailty Index (eFI), the 5-Factor Modified Frailty Index (mFI-5), and the Risk Analysis Index (RAI). Despite substantial differences in their construction, these 4 electronic frailty metrics have not been rigorously compared within a surgical population. To characterize the associations between 4 electronic frailty metrics and to measure their predictive value for adverse surgical outcomes. This retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data from patients who underwent abdominal surgery from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, at 20 medical centers within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Participants included adults older than 50 years who underwent abdominal surgical procedures at KPNC from 2010 to 2020 that were sampled for reporting to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Pearson correlation coefficients between electronic frailty metrics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of univariate models and multivariate preoperative risk models for 30-day mortality, readmission, and morbidity, which was defined as a composite of mortality and major postoperative complications. Within the cohort of 37 186 patients, mean (SD) age, 67.9 (female, 19 127 [51.4%]), correlations between pairs of metrics ranged from 0.19 (95% CI, 0.18- 0.20) for mFI-5 and RAI 0.69 (95% CI, 0.68-0.70). Only 1085 of 37 186 (2.9%) were classified as frail based on all 4 metrics. In univariate models for morbidity, HFRS demonstrated higher predictive 0.57-0.58). The predictive discrimination of multivariate models with age, sex, comorbidity burden, and procedure characteristics for all 3 adverse surgical outcomes improved by including HFRS into the models. In this cohort study, the 4 electronic frailty metrics demonstrated heterogeneous correlation and classified distinct groups of surgical patients as frail. However, HFRS demonstrated the highest predictive value for adverse surgical outcomes. Authors: Le, Sidney T; Liu, Vincent in California With or Without SARS-CoV-2 Infection During Pregnancy Additional research from population-based studies is needed to inform the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and to provide health risk information to pregnant individuals. To assess the risk of perinatal complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to describe factors associated with hospitalizations. This population-based cohort study included 43 886 pregnant individuals with longitudinal electronic health record data from preconception to delivery who delivered at Kaiser Permanente Northern California between March 1, 2020, and March 16, 2021. Individuals with diagnostic codes for COVID-19 that did not have a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded. SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by polymerase chain reaction test (from 30 days before conception to 7 days after delivery) as a time varying exposure. Severe maternal morbidity including 21 conditions (eg, acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sepsis) that occurred at any time during pregnancy or delivery; delivery; and newborn birth weight and respiratory conditions. Standardized mean differences between individuals with and without SARS-CoV-2 were calculated. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and perinatal complications and hospitalization and to consider the timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to outcomes. In this study of 43 886 pregnant individuals (mean [SD] age, 30.7 [5.2] years), individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection (1332 [3.0%]) were more likely to be younger, Hispanic, multiparous individuals with a higher neighborhood deprivation index and obesity or chronic hypertension. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and smoking status, individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection had higher risk for severe maternal morbidity (HR, 2.45; 95% CI, than individuals without SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection was also associated with increased risk of medically indicated preterm birth (HR, 2.56; 95% CI, 2.06-3.19); spontaneous preterm (HR, 95% CI, preterm birth. Among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 (5.7%) a hospitalization; pregestational diabetes (HR, 7.03; 95% CI, 2.22-22.2) and Asian or Pacific Islander (HR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.06-5.11) and Black (HR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.24-7.93) race and ethnicity were associated with an increased risk of hospitalization. In this cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased risk of severe maternal morbidity, preterm birth, and VTE. The study findings inform clinicians and patients about the risk of perinatal complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy and support vaccination of pregnant individuals and those planning conception.

Continuous Glucose Monitor Use Prevents Glycemic Deterioration in Insulin-Treated Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is indicated in poorly controlled insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) to improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, but the benefits of CGM for lower risk patients have not been well studied. Among 17,422 insulin-treated patients with T2D with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <8% and no recent severe hypoglycemia (based on emergency room visits or hospitalizations), CGM initiation occurred in 149 patients (17,273 noninitiators served as reference). Changes in HbA1c and severe hypoglycemia rates for the 12 months before and after CGM initiation were calculated. CGM initiation was associated with decreased HbA1c (-0.06%), whereas noninitiation was associated with increased HbA1c (+0.32%); a weighted adjusted difference-in-difference model of change in HbA1c yielded a net benefit of -0.30%; 95% CI -0.50%, -0.10%; P = 0.004). No significant differences were observed for severe hypoglycemia. CGM may be useful in preventing glycemic deterioration in well-controlled patients with Access in HbA1c Among People With Diabetes Video telehealth can offer people convenient, real-time access to clinicians without arranging transportation or time off work. Among people with diabetes, this study examines the association between video telehealth access and changes in HbA1c. This longitudinal cohort study (2016-2019) used linear regression with person-level fixed effects, stratified by baseline HbA1c (last value in 2015), to examine the association between video visit access and changes in HbA1c. HbA1c values were categorized into 3 periods of video visit exposure: (1) before any video visit, (2) during video visit transition year (calendar year of the first video visit), and (3) after video visits. The model compared changes in HbA1c values collected before the patient had any video visits with those collected after the transition year. Analyses were conducted in September 2020. Among 204,301 people with diabetes, video visit access was associated with a statistically significant reduction of 0.15 (95% CI= -0.19, -0.11) percentage points in HbA1c, with greater reductions among patients with an elevated baseline HbA1c value (-0.22 percentage points, 95% CI= -0.32, -0.11) 95% CI= -0.71, -0.07). Gaining access to video telehealth was associated with reductions in HbA1c among people with diabetes. Video telehealth offers people with chronic conditions a new, convenient way to access health care, is not associated with worsening HbA1c, and may support better disease management, particularly among patients with higher baseline HbA1c. 2021-12-08. Association of Low-Density after an Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Event with Subsequent Statin Adherence and Intensification This study aimed to evaluate associations between outpatient low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) testing and subsequent statin adherence and intensification in patients after an atherosclerotic cardiovascular (ASCVD) event. This was a longitudinal study of adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitalized with an ASCVD event (myocardial infarction or stroke) during January 01, 2016, to December 31, 2017, with follow-up through December 31, 2019. Outcomes were statin adherence (estimated using continuous medication gap [CMG]) and intensification (defined by an increased dose or switch to a higher-intensity statin) based on pharmacy dispensing. The exposure of interest was first outpatient LDL-C test after an ASCVD event. Baseline for follow-up was LDL-C test date or a date assigned using incidence density sampling. Multivariate logistic regression models were specified to estimate the odds ratios for statin adherence or intensification among those with vs without an LDL-C test, with adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, body mass index, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. There were 19,604 adults hospitalized with ASCVD, including 7054 adults not on high-intensity statins. The mean age was 69.5 years and 33.0% were female. Prevalence of good adherence (continuous medication gap 20%) was significantly higher (80.2% vs 75.9%; odds ratio 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-1.49; P <.001) among participants who had an LDL-C test compared with participants who did not. LDL-C testing was associated with significantly higher rates of treatment intensification (16.1% vs 10.7%; odds ratio 1.51; 95% confidence interval,1.29-1.76; P <0.001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol testing is recommended for patients with a history of ASCVD and may be a high-value and low-cost intervention to adherence 05;135(5):603-606. Epub 2021-11-30. Evaluation of Incident 7-Day Infection and Sepsis Hospitalizations in an Integrated Health System Rationale: Prehospital opportunities to predict infection and sepsis hospitalization may exist, but little is known about their incidence following common healthcare encounters. Objectives: To evaluate the incidence and timing of infection and sepsis hospitalization within 7 days of living hospital discharge, emergency department discharge, and ambulatory visit settings. Methods: In each setting, we identified patients in clinical strata based on the presence of infection and severity of illness. We estimated number needed to evaluate values with hypothetical predictive model operating characteristics. Results: We identified 97,614,228 encounters, including 1,117,702 (1.1%) hospital discharges, 4,635,517 (4.7%) emergency department discharges, and 91,861,009 (94.1%) ambulatory visits between 2012 and 2017. The incidence of 7-day infection hospitalization varied from 37,140 (3.3%) following inpatient discharge to 50,315 (1.1%) following emergency department discharge and 277,034 (0.3%) following ambulatory visits. The incidence of 7-day infection hospitalization was increased for inpatient discharges with high readmission risk (10.0%), emergency department discharges with increased acute or chronic severity of illness (3.5% and 4.7%, respectively), and ambulatory visits with acute infection (0.7%). The timing of 7-day infection and sepsis hospitalizations differed across settings with an early rise following ambulatory visits, a later peak following emergency department discharges, and a delayed peak following inpatient discharge. Theoretical number needed to evaluate values varied by strata, but following hospital and emergency department discharge, were as low as 15-25. Conclusions: Incident 7-day infection and sepsis hospitalizations following encounters in routine healthcare settings were surprisingly common and may be amenable to clinical predictive models.

Prospective evaluation of social risks, physical function, and cognitive function in prediction of non-elective rehospitalization and post-discharge mortality Increasing evidence suggests that social factors and problems with physical and cognitive function may contribute to patients' rehospitalization risk. Understanding a patient's readmission risk may help healthcare providers develop tailored treatment and post-discharge care plans to reduce readmission and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate whether including patient-reported data on social factors; cognitive status; and physical function improves on a predictive model based on electronic health record (EHR) data alone. We conducted a prospective study of 1,547 hospitalized adult patients in 3 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals. The main outcomes were non-elective rehospitalization or death within 30 days post-discharge. Exposures included patient-reported social factors and cognitive and physical function (obtained in a pre-discharge interview) and EHR-derived data for comorbidity burden, acute physiology, care directives, prior utilization, and hospital length of stay. We performed bivariate comparisons using Chi-square, t-tests, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and assessed correlations between continuous variables using Spearman's rho statistic. For all models, the results reported were obtained after fivefold cross validation. The 1,547 adult patients interviewed were younger (age, p = 0.03) and sicker (COPS2, p < 0.0001) than the rest of the hospitalized population. Of the 6 patient-reported social factors measured, 3 (not living with a spouse/partner, transportation difficulties, health or disability-related limitations in daily activities) were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the main outcomes, while 3 (living situation concerns, problems with food availability, financial problems) were not. Patient-reported cognitive (p = 0.027) and physical function (p = 0.01) were significantly lower in patients with the main outcomes. None of the patient-reported variables, singly or in combination, improved predictive performance of a model that included acute physiology and longitudinal comorbidity burden (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.716 for both the EHR model and maximal performance of a random forest model including all predictors). In this insured population, incorporating patient-reported social factors and measures of cognitive and physical function did not improve performance of an EHR-based model predicting 30-day non-elective rehospitalization or mortality. While incorporating patient-reported social and functional status data did not improve ability to predict these outcomes, such data may still be important for improving patient outcomes.

Association of standardized radiology reporting and management of abdominal CT and MRI with diagnosis of pancreatic cancer Follow-up of abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings suspicious for pancreatic cancer may be delayed if documentation is unclear. We evaluated whether standardized reporting and follow-up of imaging results reduced time to diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. We used a quasi-experimental stepped-wedge cluster design to evaluate the effectiveness of newly implemented radiology reporting system. The system standardizes the reporting of CT and MRI reports using hashtags that classify pancreatic findings. The system also automates referral of patients with findings suspicious for pancreatic cancer to a multidisciplinary care team for rapid review and follow-up. The study examined 318,331 patients who underwent CT or MRI that included the abdomen during 2016 through 2019 who had not had an eligible CT or MRI in the preceding 24 months. We evaluated the association of the intervention with incidence of pancreatic cancer within 60 days and 120 days after imaging. 38% of patients received the intervention and 1,523 (0.48%) patients were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In multivariable analysis accounting for age, race/ethnicity, sex, Charlson comorbidity, history of cancer, diabetes, and 4-month calendar period, the intervention was associated with nearly 50% greater odds of diagnosing pancreatic cancer within 60 days (adjusted OR, 1.47, 95% CI, 1.05-2.06) and 120 days (adjusted OR, 1.46, 95% CI, 1.04-2.06). In this large quasi-experimental community-based observational study, implementation standardized reporting of abdominal CT and MRI reports with clinical navigation was effective for increasing the detection and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Developing a shared sepsis data infrastructure: a systematic review and concept map to FHIR The development of a shared data infrastructure across health systems could improve research, clinical care, and health policy across a spectrum of diseases, including sepsis. Awareness of the potential value of such infrastructure has been heightened by COVID-19, as the lack of a real-time, interoperable data network impaired disease identification, mitigation, and eradication. The Sepsis on FHIR collaboration establishes a dynamic, federated, and interoperable system of sepsis data from 55 hospitals using 2 distinct inpatient electronic health record systems. Here we report on phase 1, a systematic review to identify clinical variables required to define sepsis and its subtypes to produce a concept mapping of elements onto Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Relevant papers described consensus sepsis definitions, provided criteria for sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, or detailed sepsis subtypes. Studies not written in English, published prior to 1970, or \"grey\" literature were prospectively excluded. We analyzed 55 manuscripts yielding 151 unique clinical variables. We then mapped variables to their corresponding US Core FHIR resources and specific code values. This work establishes the framework to develop a flexible infrastructure for sharing sepsis data, highlighting how FHIR could enable the extension of this approach to other important conditions relevant to public health. Authors: of Presepsis and Intrasepsis Characteristics for Prediction of Cardiovascular Events After a Sepsis Hospitalization Sepsis survivors face increased risk for cardiovascular complications; however, the contribution of intrasepsis events to cardiovascular risk profiles is unclear. Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and Intermountain Healthcare (IH) integrated healthcare delivery systems. Sepsis survivors (2011-2017 [KPNC] and 2018-2020 [IH]) greater than or equal to 40 years old without prior cardiovascular disease. Data across KPNC and IH were harmonized and grouped into presepsis (demographics, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease scores, comorbidities) or intrasepsis factors (e.g., laboratory values, vital signs, organ support, infection source) with random split for training/internal validation datasets (75%/25%) within KPNC and IH. Models were bidirectionally, externally validated between healthcare systems. None. Changes to predictive accuracy (C-statistic) of cause-specific proportional hazards models predicting 1-year cardiovascular outcomes (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation events) were compared between models that did and did not contain intrasepsis factors. Among 39,590 KPNC and 16,388 IH sepsis Permanente (KP) and 600 (3.7%) at IH experienced a cardiovascular event within 1-year after hospital discharge, including 996 (2.5%) at KP and 192 (1.2%) IH with an (1.4%) at KP and 117 (0.7%) with event, (5.8%) at KP and 371 (2.3%) with an atrial fibrillation event. Death within 1 year after sepsis occurred for 7,948 (20%) KP and 2,085 (12.7%) IH patients. Combined models with presepsis and intrasepsis factors had better discrimination for internal validation. External of models across healthcare systems showed similar performance (KPNC model within IH large healthcare systems, intrasepsis factors improved postsepsis cardiovascular risk prediction as compared with presepsis cardiovascular risk profiles. Further exploration of sepsis factors that contribute to postsepsis cardiovascular events is warranted for improved mechanistic and predictive models. Authors: Walkey AJ; Myers LC; of Outcomes Following Hospital-Wide Implementation of a Subcutaneous Insulin Protocol for Diabetic Ketoacidosis Standard diabetic ketoacidosis care in the US includes intravenous insulin treatment in the intensive care unit. Subcutaneous (SQ) insulin could decrease intensive care unit need, but the data are limited. To assess outcomes after implementation of an SQ insulin protocol for treating diabetic ketoacidosis. This cohort study is a retrospective evaluation of a prospectively implemented SQ insulin protocol. The study was conducted at an integrated health care system in Northern California. Participants included hospitalized patients with diabetic ketoacidosis at 21 hospitals between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019. The preimplementation phase was 2010 to 2015, and the postimplementation phase was 2017 to 2019. Data analysis was performed from October 2020 to January 2022. An SQ insulin treatment protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis. Difference-in-differences evaluation of the need for intensive care, mortality, readmission, and length of stay at a single intervention site using an SQ insulin protocol from 2017 onward compared with 20 control hospitals using standard care. A total of 7989 hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis occurred, with 4739 (59.3%) occurring before and 3250 (40.7%) occurring after implementation. The overall mean (SD) age was 42.3 (17.7) years, with 4137 hospitalizations (51.8%) occurring among female patients. Before implementation, SQ insulin was the first insulin used in 40 intervention (13.4%) and 651 control (14.7%) hospitalizations. After implementation, 98 hospitalizations (80.3%) received SQ insulin first at the intervention site compared with 402 hospitalizations (12.8%) at control sites. The adjusted rate ratio for intensive care unit admission was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.33-0.56) at the intervention sites, a 57% reduction compared with control sites, and was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.25-0.99) for 30-day hospital readmission, a 50% reduction. There were no significant changes in hospital length of stay and rates of death. These findings suggest that a protocol based on SQ insulin for diabetic ketoacidosis treatment was associated with significant decreases in intensive care unit need and readmission, with no evidence of increases in adverse events.

Accounting for Social Risk Does not Eliminate Race/Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Infection Among Insured Adults: a Cohort Study Communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic in the USA. To examine the relationship of self-reported social health needs with SARS-COV-2 infection by race/ethnicity among insured adults with access to high-quality health care. A prospective cohort study of 26,741 adult Kaiser Permanente Northern California members insured by Medicaid and 58,802 Kaiser Permanente Colorado members insured by Medicare Advantage who completed social risk assessments prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the independent relationships of demographic, medical, and social factors on SARS-COV-2 testing and positivity between March 1, 2020, and November 30, 2020, by race/ethnicity. Findings were similar in the two cohorts, with Latino (16-18%), Asian (11-14%), and Black (11-12%) members having the highest prevalence of SARS-COV-2 infection (ORs adjusted for age, gender, and use of interpreter ranging from 1.68 to 2.23 compared to White member [7-8%], p < 0.001). Further adjustment for medical comorbidity (e.g., obesity, diabetes, chronic lung disease); neighborhood measures; and self-reported social risk factors (e.g., trouble paying for basics, food insecurity, housing concerns, transportation barriers) did not appreciably change these results. Compared to non-Latino White members, members of other race/ethnic groups had higher positivity rates that were only minimally reduced after controlling for medical and neighborhood conditions and self-reported social risk factors. These findings suggest that traditional infection transmission factors such as essential work roles and household size that have disproportionate representation among communities of color may be important contributors to SARS-COV-2 infection among insured adults.

Primary care telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic: patient's choice of video versus telephone visit The aim of this study is to examine the association between patient characteristics and primary care telemedicine choice among integrated delivery system patients self-scheduling visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between the choice of video versus telephone and patient sociodemographic characteristics and technology access among patient-initiated primary care telemedicine visits scheduled online from March to October 2020. Among 978 272 patient-scheduled primary care telemedicine visits, 39% were video visits. Patients of Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, or living in low socioeconomic status or low internet access neighborhoods were less likely to schedule video visits. Patients 65 years or older, with prior video visit experience or mobile portal access, or visiting their own personal provider were more likely to schedule video visits. While video adoption was substantial in all patient groups examined, differences in telemedicine choice suggest the persistence of a digital divide, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a telephone telemedicine 2022 Apr;5(1):ooac002.

Differences in Health Characteristics of Geographic Subgroups of Arab Americans in a Northern California Health Plan Arab Americans are a diverse ethnic group originating from a large geographic area in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). We aim to characterize differences in health between Arab Americans from different geographic subgroups within MENA. We used cross-sectional electronic health record (EHR) data for a subset of 4913 Arab Americans aged 20-84 in a 2016 Northern California health plan study cohort who could be assigned to one of 4 geographic subgroups (Gulf, African, Levant, and Other) based on EHR ethnicity data. We calculated age-adjusted prevalence estimates for men and women and used generalized linear models to compare Gulf, African, and Other subgroups to Levant Arabs on risk factors (obesity and smoking), chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and asthma), and mental health (depression and anxiety). Among women, prevalence of smoking was lower among Gulf, African, and Other Arabs than Levant Arabs. Among men, prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia was lower among Gulf, African, and Other Arabs than Levant Arabs, while prevalence of depression was higher for these subgroups than Levant Arabs. We found substantial differences in health characteristics across Arab Americans from different geographic subgroups. Our results suggest that more detailed race and ethnicity information should be collected on Arab Americans to better understand their diverse health 2022 Apr;9(2):399-405. Epub 2021-01-27. All in the Family: A Qualitative Study of the Early Experiences of Adults with Younger Onset Type 2 Diabetes Adults with type 2 diabetes diagnosed at a younger age are at increased risk for poor outcomes. We examined life stage-related facilitators and barriers to early self-management among younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. We conducted 6 focus groups that each met twice between November 2017 and May 2018. Participants (n = 41) were aged 21 to 44 years and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes during the prior 2 years. Transcripts were coded using thematic analysis and themes were mapped to the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior framework. Participants were 38.4 (\u00b15.8) years old; 10 self-identified as Latinx, 12 as Black, 12 as White, and 7 as multiple or other races. We identified 9 themes that fell into 2 categories: (1) the impact of having an adult family member with diabetes, and (2) the role of nonadult children. Family members with diabetes served as both positive and negative role models, and, for some, personal familiarity with the disease made adjusting to the diagnosis easier. Children facilitated their parents' self-management by supporting self-management activities and motivating their parents to remain healthy. However, the stress and time demands resulting from parental responsibilities and the tendency to prioritize children's needs were perceived as barriers to self-management. Our results highlight how the life position of younger-onset individuals with type 2 diabetes influences their early experiences. Proactively addressing perceived barriers to and facilitators of self-management in the context of family history and parenthood may aid in efforts to support these high-risk, younger patients.

Future of Teleoncology: Trends and Disparities in Telehealth and Secure Message Utilization in the COVID-19 Era The COVID-19 pandemic created an imperative to re-examine the role of telehealth in oncology. We studied trends and disparities in utilization of telehealth (video and telephone visits) and secure messaging (SM; ie, e-mail via portal/app), before and during the pandemic. Retrospective cohort study of hematology/oncology patient visits (telephone/video/office) and SM between January 1, 2019, and September 30, 2020, at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Among 334,666 visits and 1,161,239 SM, monthly average office visits decreased from 10,562 prepandemic to 1,769 during pandemic, telephone visits increased from 5,114 to 8,663, and video visits increased from 40 to 4,666. Monthly average SM increased from 50,788 to 64,315 since the pandemic began. Video visits were a significantly higher fraction of all visits (P < .01) in (1) younger patients (Generation Z 48%, Millennials 46%; Generation X 40%; Baby Boomers 34.4%; Silent Generation 24.5%); (2) patients with commercial insurance (39%) compared with Medicaid (32.7%) or Medicare (28.1%); (3) English speakers (33.7%) compared with those requiring an interpreter (24.5%); (4) patients who are Asian (35%) and non-Hispanic White (33.7%) compared with Black (30.1%) and Hispanic White (27.5%); (5) married/domestic partner patients (35%) with single/divorced/widowed (29.9%); (6) Charlson comorbidity index 3 (36.2%) compared with > 3 (31.3%); and (7) males (34.6%) compared with females (32.3%). Similar statistically significant SM utilization patterns were also seen. In the pandemic era, hematology/oncology telehealth and SM use rapidly increased in a manner that is feasible and sustained. Possible disparities existed in video visit and SM use by age, insurance plan, language, race, ethnicity, marital status, comorbidities, and 2022 Mar;6:e2100160. Comparison of cognitive function in older adults with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and no diabetes: results from the Study of Longevity in Diabetes (SOLID) The incidence of both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing. Life expectancy is improving in T1D, resulting in a growing population of elderly adults with diabetes. While it is well established that older adults with T2D are at increased risk of cognitive impairment, little is known regarding cognitive aging in T1D and how their cognitive profiles may differ from T2D. We compared baseline cognitive function and low cognitive function by diabetes status (n=734 T1D, n=232 T2D, n=247 without diabetes) among individuals from the Study of Longevity in Diabetes (mean age=68). We used factor analysis to group cognition into five domains and a composite measure of total cognition. Using linear and logistic regression models, we examined the associations between diabetes type and cognitive function, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, depression, and sleep quality. T1D was associated with lower scores on total cognition, language, executive function/psychomotor processing speed, and verbal episodic memory, and greater odds of low executive function/psychomotor processing speed (OR=2.99, 95% CI 1.66 to 5.37) and verbal episodic memory (OR=1.92, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.46), compared with those without diabetes. T2D was associated with lower scores on visual episodic memory. Compared with T2D, T1D was associated with lower scores on verbal episodic memory and executive function/psychomotor processing speed and greater odds of low executive function/psychomotor processing speed (OR=1.74, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.92). Older adults with T1D had significantly poorer cognition compared with those with T2D and those without diabetes even after accounting for a range of comorbidities. Future studies should delineate how to reduce risk in this vulnerable population who are newly surviving to old age. Authors: Lacy, Mary E; Open Diabetes Res Care. 2022 03;10(2).

Impact of the Affordable Care Act on Colorectal Cancer Incidence and Mortality The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act eliminated cost sharing for preventive services, including colorectal cancer screening for individuals aged 50-75 years with private health insurance. This study examines the impact of the Affordable Care Act's removal of cost sharing for colorectal cancer screening on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Trends in colorectal cancer incidence and colorectal cancerrelated mortality were modeled among 2,113,283 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members aged 50 years between 2003 and 2016 using an interrupted time-series design. As a sensitivity analysis, a controlled analysis utilized a comparison group of members covered with preAffordable Care Act zero cost sharing for colorectal cancer screening. Analyses were performed in 2019 and 2020. The colorectal cancer incidence dropped by 17% around the time the Affordable Care Act was enacted (change in level incidence rate ratio; 95% CI=0.77, 0.90, 2-sided p-value year (95% CI=0.93, 1.00, p=0.05). A similar pattern was observed for colorectal cancerrelated mortality. The controlled results indicated that the elimination of cost sharing for screening due to the Affordable Care Act was associated with greater improvements in colorectal cancer outcomes among members previously covered by health plans with out-of-pocket costs for screening than among those with health plans with zero cost sharing for screening before the Affordable Care Act. The elimination of cost sharing for colorectal cancer screening due to the Affordable Care Act was associated with a decrease in age-, race/ethnicity-, and sex-adjusted colorectal cancer incidence and colorectal cancerrelated mortality, implying that policies that remove barriers to screening, particularly financial burden from cost sharing, can result in improved colorectal cancer outcomes.

Association of Intensive Care Unit Admission and Outcomes in Sepsis and Acute Respiratory Failure Rationale: Many decisions to admit patients to the ICU are not grounded in evidence regarding who benefits from such triage, straining ICU capacity and limiting its cost-effectiveness. Objectives: To measure the benefits of ICU admission for patients with sepsis or acute respiratory failure. Methods: At 27 United States hospitals across two health systems from 2013 to 2018, we performed a retrospective cohort study using two-stage instrumental variable quantile regression with a strong instrument (hospital capacity strain) governing ICU versus ward admission among high-acuity patients (i.e., laboratory-based acute physiology score v2 100) with sepsis and/or acute respiratory failure who did not require mechanical ventilation or vasopressors in the emergency department. Measurements and Main Results: Among patients with sepsis (n = 90,150), admission to the ICU was associated with a 1.32-day longer hospital length of stay (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.63; P < 0.001) (when treating deaths as equivalent to long lengths of stay) and higher in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.13-1.88; P = 0.004). Among patients with respiratory failure (n = 45,339), admission to the ICU was associated with a 0.82-day shorter hospital length of stay (95% CI, -1.17 to -0.46; P < 0.001) and reduced in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-0.96; P = 0.04). In sensitivity analyses of length of stay, excluding, ignoring, or censoring death, results were similar in sepsis but not in respiratory failure. In subgroup analyses, harms of ICU admission for patients with sepsis were concentrated among older patients and those with fewer comorbidities, and the benefits of ICU admission for patients with respiratory failure were concentrated among older patients, highest-acuity patients, and those with more comorbidities. Conclusions: Among high-acuity patients with sepsis who did not require life support in the emergency department, initial admission to the ward, compared with the ICU, was associated with shorter length of stay and improved survival, whereas among patients with acute respiratory failure, triage to the ICU compared with the ward was associated with improved survival.

Patient Experience and Satisfaction with Immediate Sequential and Delayed Sequential Bilateral Cataract Surgery In bilaterally pseudophakic patients who received immediate or delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS), we sought to determine patient experience, particularly related to the loss of opportunity to modify the surgical plan for the second eye. Cross-sectional. Patients who received ISBCS (n = 1818) and DSBCS (n = 1818) in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California system between 2017 and 2019 who actively used the electronic patient portal were randomly selected and sent a survey link. The survey inquired about reasons for choosing ISBCS or DSBCS, concerns about surgery, and whether the loss of opportunity to modify the surgical plan for the second eye affected the patient's decision to undergo ISBCS. Participation was 18% among patients who received ISBCS and 17% among patients who received DSBCS. Of the patients who received ISBCS, 96% would choose ISBCS again while 80% of patients who received DSBCS would choose DSBCS again (P < .0001). Convenience was the leading reason patients chose ISBCS (65%), whereas surgeon recommendation was the primary reason patients chose DSBCS (68%). Sixteen percent of patients who received ISBCS and 38% of patients who received DSCBS reported that the possibility of modifying the surgical plan to reduce the need for corrective lenses in the second eye was an important consideration (P < .0001). Compared with patient who chose DSBCS, patients who chose ISBCS were more likely to choose ISBCS again and to recommend ISBCS to a family member or friend. The option to modify the surgical plan for the second eye to reduce need for glasses or contact lenses was not an important consideration for most of either group. Authors: Carolan, 03;235:241-248.

Outcomes After Implementation of a Benzodiazepine-Sparing Alcohol Withdrawal Order Set in an Integrated Health Care System Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a common inpatient diagnosis managed primarily with benzodiazepines. Concerns about the adverse effects associated with benzodiazepines have spurred interest in using benzodiazepine-sparing treatments. To evaluate changes in outcomes after implementation of a benzodiazepine-sparing AWS inpatient order set that included adjunctive valproic acid, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine). This difference-in-differences quality improvement study was conducted among 22 899 AWS adult hospitalizations from October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2019, in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated health care delivery system. Data were analyzed from September 2020 through November 2021. Implementation of the benzodiazepine-sparing AWS order set on October 1, 2018. Adjusted rate ratios for medication use, inpatient mortality, length of stay, intensive care unit admission, and nonelective readmission within 30 days were calculated comparing postimplementation and preimplementation periods among hospitals with and without order set use. Among 904 540 hospitalizations in the integrated health care delivery system during the study period, AWS was present in 22 899 hospitalizations (2.5%), occurring among 16 323 unique patients (mean [SD] age, 57.1 [14.8] years; 15 764 [68.8%] men). Of these hospitalizations, 12 889 (56.3%) used an order set for alcohol withdrawal. Among hospitalizations with order set use, any benzodiazepine use decreased after implementation from 6431 hospitalizations (78.1%) to 2823 hospitalizations (60.7%) (P < .001), with concomitant decreases in the mean (SD) total dosage of lorazepam before vs after implementation (19.7 [38.3] mg vs 6.0 [9.1] mg; P < .001). There were also significant changes from before to after implementation in the use of adjunctive medications, including gabapentin (2413 hospitalizations [29.3%] vs (1476 (6298 [76.5%] vs 4047 hospitalizations [87.0%]; P < .001), valproic acid (109 hospitalizations [1.3%] vs 256 hospitalizations [5.5%]; P < .001), and phenobarbital (412 hospitalizations [5.0%] vs 292 hospitalizations [6.3%]; P = .003). Compared with AWS hospitalizations without order set use, use of the benzodiazepine-sparing order set was associated with decreases in intensive care unit use (adjusted rate ratio [ARR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.89; P = .003) and hospital length of stay (ARR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.86; P < .001). This study found that implementation of a benzodiazepine-sparing AWS order set was associated with decreased use of benzodiazepines and favorable trends in outcomes. These findings suggest that further prospective research is needed to identify the most effective treatments regimens for patients hospitalized with alcohol withdrawal.

Engaging patients in population-based chronic disease management: A qualitative study of barriers and intervention opportunities Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be a leading cause of morbidity in the U.S. Managing CVD risk factors, such as diabetes or hypertension, can be challenging for many individuals. We investigated the barriers experienced by patients who persistently struggled to reach their CVD risk factor control goals. This qualitative study examined patient, clinician, and researcher observations of individuals' experiences in a chronic disease management program. All participants (n = 332) were enrolled in a clinical trial testing a skills-based group intervention seeking to improve healthcare engagement. Data were analyzed through a general inductive approach and resulting themes were structured along the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior framework. Analyses identified care engagement barriers related to participants' communication skills and activation, care team relationship processes, and emotional factors. Although most participants reported benefitting from skills training, persistent barriers included distrust of their providers, shame about health challenges, and dissatisfaction with care team interactions that were described as impersonal or unresponsive. Efforts to support engagement in CVD risk factor management programs should address whether patients and their care team have the necessary skills, opportunities and confidence to proactively communicate health needs and engage in non-judgmental interactions for goal-setting, Glucose Recommendations Change Clinician Attitudes or Behaviors? A Mixed-Method Assessment In 2015, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) revised clinical recommendations to more broadly recommend abnormal blood glucose screening and more clearly recommend referral to behavioral interventions for adults with prediabetes. To assess the effects of the 2015 USPSTF recommendation changes on abnormal blood glucose screening and referral to behavioral interventions, and to examine physicians' perceptions of the revised recommendation. We utilized a sequential, dependent mixed-methods triangulation design. A total of 33,444 patients meeting USPSTF abnormal blood glucose screening criteria within 15 health system-affiliated primary care practices and 20 primary care physicians in North Carolina. We assessed monthly abnormal blood glucose screening rate and monthly referral rate to behavioral interventions. To estimate trend changes in outcomes, we used segmented linear regression analysis of interrupted time-series data. We gathered physicians' perspectives on the 2015 USPSTF abnormal blood glucose recommendation including awareness of, agreement with, adoption of, and adherence to the recommendation. To analyze qualitative data, we used directed content analysis. There was a slight significant change in trend in abnormal blood glucose screening rates post-recommendation. There was a slight, statistically significant decrease in referral rates to behavioral interventions post-recommendation. Physicians were generally unaware of the revisions to the 2015 USPSTF abnormal blood glucose recommendation; however, once the recommendations were described, physicians agreed with the screening recommendation but felt that the behavioral intervention referral recommendation was hard to implement. The 2015 USPSTF abnormal blood glucose guideline had little to no effect on abnormal blood glucose screening or referral to behavioral interventions in North Carolina practices. Potential interventions to improve these rates could include clinical decision tools embedded in the electronic health record and better referral systems for community-based diabetes prevention programs.

Oral health is an important component of overall health, and preventive dental care is essential for maintaining good oral health. However, many patients face significant barriers to preventive dental care. We examined prevalence of and factors associated with no recent preventive dental care in an adult health plan population. For this cross-sectional study, we used data for 19,672 Kaiser Permanente members aged 25-85 who participated in the 2014/2015 or 2017 Member Health Survey (MHS) and 20,329 Medicaid members who completed an intake questionnaire. We estimated percentages of adults with no preventive dental care (teeth cleaning and examination by a dental professional) in the prior 12 months, overall and among four racial groups, by age, sex, education, income, and dental care cost factors. We used logistic regression to model associations of sociodemographic and cost factors with no preventive dental care. We also examined lack of preventive dental care in subgroups at elevated risk for periodontal disease. Overall prevalence of no preventive dental care was 21%, with significant differences by race (non-Hispanic White, 19.6%; African-American/Black, 29.3%; Latinx, 24.9%, Asian American/Pacific Islander, 19.6%). Adults with lower educational attainment and household income and dental care cost barriers were more likely to lack preventive dental care. Racial and socioeconomic factors remained significant in the multivariable models. Lack of preventive dental care was fairly common among adults with diabetes, prediabetes, hypertension, smokers, frequent consumption of sugary beverages, and Medicaid coverage. Oral health care should be better integrated with primary medical care to promote adult total health. Authors: Gordon, Nancy P; Mosen, David ASO Author Reflections: Volume Matters-Longitudinal Retrospective Cohort Study of Outcomes Following Consultation and Standardization of Adrenal Surgery Authors: in a Diverse Multihospital System Hospital-specific template matching is a newer method of hospital performance measurement that may be fairer than regression-based benchmarking. However, it has been tested in only limited research settings. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of hospital-specific template matching assessments in the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system and determine power to detect greater-than-expected 30-day mortality. Observational cohort study with hospital-specific template matching assessment. For each VA hospital, the 30-day mortality of a representative subset of hospitalizations was compared with the pooled mortality from matched hospitalizations at a set of comparison VA hospitals treating sufficiently similar patients. The simulation was used to determine power to detect greater-than-expected mortality. A total of 556,266 hospitalizations at 122 VA hospitals in 2017. A number of comparison hospitals identified per hospital; 30-day mortality. Each hospital had a median of 38 comparison hospitals (interquartile range: 33, 44) identified, and 116 (95.1%) had at least 20 comparison hospitals. In total, 8 hospitals (6.6%) had a significantly lower 30-day mortality than their benchmark, 5 hospitals (4.1%) had a significantly higher 30-day mortality, and the remaining 109 hospitals (89.3%) were similar to their benchmark. Power to detect a standardized mortality ratio of 2.0 ranged from 72.5% to 79.4% for a hospital with the fewest (6) versus most (64) comparison hospitals. Hospital-specific template matching may be feasible for assessing hospital performance in the diverse VA health care system, but further refinements are needed to optimize the approach before operational use. Our findings are likely applicable to other large and diverse multihospital systems. Authors: Vincent, Brenda 01;59(12):1090-1098.

Prior Immunosuppressive Therapy and Severe Illness Among Patients Diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2: a Community-Based Study An estimated 10 million people in the USA are immunocompromised, a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Data informing whether immune-mediated medications lead to more severe infection are sparse. Determine whether outpatient immunosuppressive therapies that treat autoimmune inflammatory disease or prevent solid organ transplant rejection are associated with severe illness after diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study PARTICIPANTS: Adults with a positive PCR nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 from February 25 to September 9, 2020, cared for within a large integrated health care organization MAIN MEASURES: Exposure was defined as an outpatient fill of prednisone, immunomodulator, small-molecule, or biologic therapy in the 105 days prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The main outcome was either hospitalization, ICU admission, or death within 45 days after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for age, race, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, and autoimmune disease. A total of 39,686 adults had a positive PCR test. In the primary analysis, prior prednisone use was associated with severe illness after diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio (OR) 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) immunomodulator (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.79-2.00) were not. Secondary analyses showed variable risk among therapies: Janus-kinase inhibitors had an increased odds of severe illness (OR 3.35; 95% CI 1.16-9.67), thiopurines/conventionaldisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs had a reduced odds (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.32-0.88), and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors were not associated (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.18-1.08). Outpatient use of prednisone is associated with severe illness after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Immunomodulator and biologic/small-molecule therapy were not associated, but different risk subgroups were identified. Our findings can inform risk-benefit discussions in the clinic and risk-based recommendations for patients on these therapies.

Volume Matters: Longitudinal Retrospective Cohort Study of Outcomes Following Consultation and Standardization of Adrenal Surgery Subspecialization of adrenal surgery through regionalization has not been adequately evaluated. We assessed implementation of subspecialization and the association of regionalization with adrenalectomy outcomes in a community-based setting. In this longitudinal retrospective cohort study, we used an interrupted time series analysis on consecutive adrenal surgeries at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, 2010-2019. The intervention was regionalization of surgery in 2016. Main outcomes include surgical volumes, operative time, length of stay, 30-day return-to-care, and 30-day complications obtained from the electronic medical record. t-Tests and multivariable models were used to analyze time trends in outcomes after accounting for changes in patient and disease characteristics. In total, 850 adrenal surgery cases were eligible. Between 2010 and 2019, the annual incidence of surgery (per 100,000 persons) increased from 2.4 (95% CI 1.9-3.1) to 4.1 (95% CI 3.5-4.8). Average annual surgeon volume increased from 2.4 (95% CI 1.6-3.1) to 9.9 (95% CI 4.9-14.9), while hospital volume increased from 3.5 (95% CI 2.3-4.6) to 15.4 (95% CI 6.9-24.0). Operative time was 34 (23-45) min faster in 2018-2019 compared with 2010-2011. After regionalization, same-day discharges increased to 64% in 2019 (p < 0.0001). The frequency of return-to-care (p = 0.69) and the overall complication rate (p = 0.31) did not change. Regionalizing adrenal surgery through surgical subspecialization and standardized care pathways was feasible and decreased operative time, and hospital stay, while increasing the frequency of same-day discharges without increasing return-to-care or complications.

Weight Outcomes of Sleeve Gastrectomy and Gastric Bypass Compared to Nonsurgical Treatment To investigate weight trajectories among patients with severe obesity undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and nonsurgical treatment. Although bariatric procedures are associated with substantial weight loss, few studies have compared surgical outcomes to nonsurgical treatment, particularly for SG. In this retrospective, matched cohort study, adult patients with body mass index 35 kg/m2 who underwent RYGB or SG procedures from January 2005 through September 2015 were matched to 87,965 nonsurgical patients. Hierarchical linear models were used to investigate percent total weight loss (%TWL) and regain at 5 years among RYGB, SG, and nonsurgical patients, and at 10 years for RYGB and nonsurgical patients. Among 13,900 72.0%, respectively. RYGB 28.4%TWL (95% confidence interval: 28.2, 28.5), SG 23.0%TWL (22.8, 23.2), and nonsurgical patients 0.2%TWL (0.1, 0.4). At 5 years, RYGB had 21.7%TWL (21.5, 22.0), SG 16.0%TWL (15.4, 16.6), and nonsurgical patients 2.2%TWL (2.0, 2.5). After 5 years, 3.7% of RYGB and 10.1% of SG patients had regained weight to within 5% of baseline. At 10 years, RYGB patients had 20.2%TWL (19.3, 21.0) and nonsurgical patients 4.8%TWL (4.0, 5.5). In this study, patients with severe obesity who underwent SG and RYGB lost significantly more weight at 5 years than nonsurgical patients. Weight regain was common after surgery but regain to within 5% of baseline was rare. 01;274(6):e1269-e1276. Computed Tomography Use in Children With Minor Head Trauma Presenting to 21 Community Emergency Departments Within an Integrated Health-Care System Decreasing unnecessary cranial computed tomography (CT) use in pediatric head trauma patients remains important for emergency departments (EDs) across the US. Our study evaluated CT use in children with minor blunt head trauma in 21 community EDs within an integrated health-care system. We studied all children younger than 18 years old presenting to 21 community EDs between 2016 through 2018 with acute minor blunt head trauma, defined by an algorithm of ED chief complaints and diagnoses. We excluded patients with traumatic brain injuries diagnosed in the prior year, a CT within 24 hours prior to the ED visit, or an ED Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 14. Among 39,792 pediatric minor head trauma ED visits, the aggregate CT use proportion across all EDs was 12.9% [95% confidence interval (CI), 12.6-13.3%; facility-level range, 5.4-21.6%]. The 7 facilities that had previously received a clinical decision support system intervention implementing the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network rules during 2013 through 2014 had an aggregate mean CT ordering rate of 11.2% (95% CI, range, 7.3-21.6%) for the nonintervention facilities. CT use for children with minor blunt head trauma in the community EDs of an integrated health-care system was low and stable across facilities from 2016 through 2018. This may be indicative of the safe stewardship of resources in the system, including the absence of financial or medicolegal incentives to scan very low-risk patients as well the availability of resources for close patient follow-up.

Graded Coronary Risk Stratification for Emergency Department Patients With Chest Pain: A Controlled Cohort Study Background Resource utilization among emergency department (ED) patients with possible coronary chest pain is highly variable. Methods and Results Controlled cohort study amongst 21 EDs of an integrated healthcare system examining the implementation of a graded coronary risk stratification algorithm (RISTRA-ACS [risk stratification for acute coronary syndrome]). Thirteen EDs had access to RISTRA-ACS within the electronic health record (RISTRA sites) beginning in month 24 of a 48-month study period (January 2016 to December 2019); the remaining 8 EDs served as contemporaneous controls. Study participants had a chief complaint of chest pain and serum troponin measurement in the ED. The primary outcome was index visit resource utilization (observation unit or hospital admission, or 7-day objective cardiac testing). Secondary outcomes were 30-day objective cardiac testing, 60-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and 60-day MACE-CR (MACE excluding coronary revascularization). Difference-in-differences analyses controlled for secular trends with stratification by estimated risk and adjustment for risk factors, ED physician and facility. A total of 154 914 encounters were included. Relative to control sites, 30-day objective cardiac testing decreased at RISTRA sites among patients with low (2%) estimated 60-day MACE risk (-2.5%, 95% CI -3.7 P<0.001) (+2.8%, 95% CI 95% CI -2.1 to 0.1%, P=0.079). There were no statistically significant differences in index visit resource utilization, 60-day MACE or 60-day MACE-CR. Conclusions Implementation of RISTRA-ACS was associated with better allocation of 30-day objective cardiac testing and no change in index visit resource utilization or 60-day MACE.

Does NAFLD Mediate the Relationship Between Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Risk? Evidence from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) To estimate the effect of obesity on type 2 diabetes (T2DM) risk and evaluate to what extent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mediates this association. Data came from 4,522 adults ages 45-84 participating in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort. Baseline obesity was defined using established BMI categories. NAFLD was measured by CT scans at baseline and incident T2DM defined as fasting glucose 126 mg/dL or use of diabetes medications. Over a median 9.1 years of follow-up between 2000 and 2012, 557 new cases of T2DM occurred. After adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, diet and exercise, those with obesity had 4.5 times the risk of T2DM compared to normal weight (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0, 5.9). The mediation analysis suggested that NAFLD accounted for ~36% (95% CI: 27, 44) of the effect (direct effect HR = 3.2, 95% CI: 2.3, 4.6; indirect effect through NAFLD, HR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.3, 1.5). These data suggest that the association between obesity and T2DM risk is partially explained by the presence of NAFLD. Future studies should evaluate if NAFLD could be an effective target to reduce the effect of obesity on T2DM. Authors: Rodriguez, 2021-07-19. Disparities in Use of Video Telemedicine Among Patients With Limited English Proficiency During the COVID-19 Pandemic Authors: Hsueh, Epub 2021-11-01. Attitudes and Perceptions of Multidisciplinary Cancer Care Clinicians Toward Telehealth and Secure Messages Telehealth use including secure messages has rapidly expanded since the COVID-19 pandemic, including for multidisciplinary aspects of cancer care. Recent reports described rapid uptake and various benefits for patients and clinicians, suggesting that telehealth may be in standard use after the pandemic. To examine attitudes and perceptions of multidisciplinary cancer care clinicians toward telehealth and secure messages. Cross-sectional specialty-specific survey (ie, some questions appear only for relevant specialties) among multidisciplinary cancer care clinicians, collected from April 29, 2020, to June 5, 2020. Participants were all 285 clinicians in the fields of medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, survivorship, and oncology navigation from all 21 community cancer centers of Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Clinician satisfaction, perceived benefits and challenges of telehealth, perceived quality of telehealth and secure messaging, preferred visit and communication types for different clinical activities, and preferences regarding postpandemic telehealth use. A total of 202 clinicians (71%) responded (104 of 128 medical oncologists, 34 of 37 radiation oncologists, 16 of 62 breast surgeons, 18 of 28 navigators, and 30 of 30 survivorship experts; 57% (116 of were 202] between ages 36-55 years). Seventy-six percent (n = 154) were satisfied with telehealth without statistically significant variations based on clinician characteristics. In-person visits were thought to promote a strong patient-clinician connection by 99% (n = 137) of respondents compared with 77% (n = 106) for video visits, 43% (n = 59) for telephone, and 14% (n = 19) for secure messages. The most commonly cited benefits of telehealth to clinicians included reduced commute (79%; n = 160), working from home (74%; n = 149), and staying on time (65%; n = 132); the most commonly cited negative factors included internet connection (84%; n = 170) or equipment problems (72%; n = 146), or physical examination needed (64%; n = 131). Most respondents (59%; n = 120) thought that video is adequate to manage the greater part of patient care in general; and most deemed various telehealth modalities suitable for any of the queried types of patient-clinician activities. For some specific activities, less than half of respondents thought that only an in-person visit is acceptable (eg, 49%; n = 66 for end-of-life discussion, 35%; n = 58 for new diagnosis). Most clinicians (82%; n = 166) preferred to maintain or increase use of telehealth after the pandemic. In this survey of multidisciplinary cancer care clinicians in the COVID-19 era, telehealth was well received and often preferred by most cancer care clinicians, who deemed it appropriate to manage most aspects of cancer care. As telehealth use becomes routine in some cancer care settings, video and telephone visits and use of asynchronous secure messaging with patients in cancer care has clear potential to extend beyond the pandemic period. Authors: Neeman, Elad; Reed, Mary; Associated With Patient-Scheduled Primary Care Telemedicine and In-Person Visits in a Large Integrated Health System Telemedicine visits can offer patients convenient access to a clinician, but it is unclear whether treatment differs from that with in-person visits or how often patients require in-person follow-up. To examine whether physician prescribing and orders differ between telemedicine and office visits, whether physicians conducting telemedicine visits are more likely to require in-person follow-up, and whether telemedicine visits are associated with more health events. This cohort study included all patients who scheduled primary care appointments through the patient portal of a large integrated health care delivery system newly implementing patient-scheduled video telemedicine visits from January 2016 to May 2018. Adjusted rates of any medication prescribed or laboratory tests or imaging ordered and rates of follow-up health care utilization (in-person visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations) within 7 days after the index visit, stratified by index primary care visit type, were generated using multivariable adjustment for patient, access, and clinical characteristics. This study included 1 131 722 patients (611 821 [54%] female; mean [SD] age, 43 [22] years) with 2 178 440 total appointments (307 888 [14%] telemedicine), of which 13.5% were for patients younger than 18 years, 22.2% were for patients 65 years or older, and 54.9% were for female patients. After adjustment, 38.6% (95% CI, 38.0%-39.3%) of video visits, 34.7% (95% of telephone visits, and 51.9% (95% CI, 51.8%-52.0%) of office visits had any medication prescribed; laboratory tests or imaging were ordered for 29.2% (95% CI, 28.5%-29.8%) of video visits, 27.3% (95% of telephone visits, and 59.3% (95% CI, 59.3%-59.4%) of clinic visits. After adjustment, follow-up visits within 7 days occurred after 25.4% (95% CI, 24.7%-26.0%) of video visits, 26.0% (95% of telephone visits, and 24.5% (95% CI, 24.5%-24.6%) of office visits. Adjusted emergency department visits and rates of hospitalizations were not statistically significantly different by primary care index visit type. In this cohort study of patient self-scheduled primary care telemedicine visits within ongoing patient-physician relationships, prescribing and orders were significantly lower for telemedicine visits than for clinic visits, with slightly higher follow-up office visits for telemedicine but no difference in health events (emergency department visits or hospitalizations). Video or telephone visits may be a convenient and efficient way to access primary care and address patient needs. Authors: 2021-11-01. Clinical Outcomes Following Regionalization of Gastric Cancer Care in a US Integrated Health Care System In 2016, Kaiser Permanente Northern California regionalized gastric cancer care, introducing a regional comprehensive multidisciplinary care team, standardizing staging and chemotherapy, and implementing laparoscopic gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy for patients eligible for curative-intent surgery. This study evaluated the effect of regionalization on outcomes. The retrospective cohort study included gastric cancer cases diagnosed from January 2010 to May 2018. Information was obtained from the electronic medical record, cancer registry, state vital statistics, and chart review. Overall survival was compared in patients with all stages of disease, stage I-III disease, and curative-intent gastrectomy patients using annual inception cohorts. For the latter, the surgical approach and surgical outcomes were also compared. Among 1,429 eligible patients with gastric cancer with all stages of disease, one third were treated after regionalization, 650 had stage I-III disease, and 394 underwent curative-intent surgery. Among surgical patients, neoadjuvant chemotherapy utilization increased from 35% to 66% (P < .0001), laparoscopic gastrectomy increased to (P and D2 lymphadenectomy increased from 2% to 80% (P < .0001). Dissection of 15 lymph nodes increased from 61% to 95% (P < .0001). Surgical complication rates did not appear to increase after regionalization. Length of hospitalization decreased from 7 to 3 days (P < .001). Overall survival at 2 years was as follows: all stages, 32.8% pre and 37.3% post (P = .20); stage I-III cases with or without surgery, 55.6% and 61.1%, respectively (P = .25); and among surgery patients, 72.7% and 85.5%, respectively (P < .03). Regionalization of gastric cancer care within an integrated system allowed comprehensive multidisciplinary care, conversion to laparoscopic gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy, increased overall survival among surgery patients, and no increase in surgical complications.

Aligning care with the personal values of patients with complex care needs To identify opportunities to align care with the personal values of patients from three distinct groups with complex medical, behavioral, and social needs. Between June and August 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with individuals with complex care needs in two integrated health care delivery systems. Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. We interviewed three groups of patients at Kaiser Permanente Washington and Kaiser Permanente Colorado representing three distinct profiles of complex care needs: Group A (\"obesity, opioid prescription, and low-resourced neighborhood\"), Group B (\"older, high medical morbidity, emergency department, and hospital use\"), and Group C (\"older, mental and physical health concerns, and low-resourced neighborhood\"). These profiles were identified based on prior work and prioritized by internal primary care stakeholders. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Twenty-four patients participated; eight from each complex needs profile. Mean age across groups was 71 (range 48-86) years. We identified five themes common across the three groups that captured patients' views regarding values-aligned care. These themes focused on the importance of care teams exploring and acknowledging a patient's values, providing access to nonphysician providers who have different perspectives on care delivery, offering values-aligned mental health care, ensuring connection to community-based resources that support values and address needs, and providing care that supports the patient plus their family and caregivers. Our results suggest several opportunities to improve how care is delivered to patients with different complex medical, behavioral, and social needs. Future research is needed to better understand how to incorporate these opportunities into health care. Authors: Tuzzio, Leah; 10;56 Suppl 1:1037-1044. Epub 2021-08-25. Adjusting for selection bias due to missing data in electronic health records-based research While electronic health records data provide unique opportunities for research, numerous methodological issues must be considered. Among these, selection bias due to incomplete/missing data has received far less attention than other issues. Unfortunately, standard missing data approaches (e.g. inverse-probability weighting and multiple imputation) generally fail to acknowledge the complex interplay of heterogeneous decisions made by patients, providers, and health systems that govern whether specific data elements in the electronic health records are observed. This, in turn, renders the missing-at-random assumption difficult to believe in standard approaches. In the clinical literature, the collection of decisions that gives rise to the observed data is referred to as the data provenance. Building on a recently-proposed framework for modularizing the data provenance, we develop a general and scalable framework for estimation and inference with respect to regression models based on inverse-probability weighting that allows for a hierarchy of missingness mechanisms to better align with the complex nature of electronic health records data. We show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically Normal, derive the form of the asymptotic variance, and propose two consistent estimators. Simulations show that na\u00efve application of standard methods may yield biased point estimates, that the proposed estimators have good small-sample properties, and that researchers may have to contend with a bias-variance trade-off as they consider how to handle missing data. The proposed methods are motivated by an on-going, electronic health records-based study of bariatric Updated USPSTF Screening Recommendations for Diabetes: Identification of Abnormal Glucose Metabolism in Younger Adults Authors: Grant, Richard W; Gopalan, Anjali; Jaffe, Algorithmic prognostication in critical care: a promising but unproven technology for supporting difficult decisions Patients, surrogate decision makers, and clinicians face weighty and urgent decisions under uncertainty in the ICU, which could be aided by risk prediction. Although emerging artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms could reduce uncertainty surrounding these life and death decisions, certain criteria must be met to ensure their bedside value. Although ICU severity of illness scores have existed for decades, these tools have not been shown to predict well or to improve outcomes for individual patients. Novel AI/ML tools offer the promise of personalized ICU care but remain untested in clinical trials. Ensuring that these predictive models account for heterogeneity in patient characteristics and treatments, are not only specific to a clinical action but also consider the longitudinal course of critical illness, and address patient-centered outcomes related to equity, transparency, and shared decision-making will increase the likelihood that these tools improve outcomes. Improved clarity around standards and contributions from institutions and critical care departments will be essential. Improved ICU prognostication, enabled by advanced ML/AI methods, offer a promising approach to inform difficult and urgent decisions under uncertainty. However, critical knowledge gaps around performance, equity, safety, and effectiveness must be filled and prospective, randomized testing of predictive interventions are still needed.

Ultrasound characteristics of early stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer Survival from ovarian cancer is strongly dependent on the stage at diagnosis. Therefore, when confronted with a woman with an isolated adnexal mass, clinicians worry about missing the opportunity to detect cancer at an early stage. High-grade serous ovarian cancers account for 80% of ovarian cancer deaths, largely because of their tendency to be diagnosed at a late stage. Among adnexal masses, large size and the presence of solid areas on ultrasound examination have been found to be associated with cancer, but it is unclear whether these characteristics identify early-stage cases. This study aimed to evaluate the ultrasound findings associated with clinically detected early-stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer. This was a retrospective cohort study of women diagnosed with stage I or II high-grade serous ovarian or fallopian tube cancer measuring at least 1 cm at pathology from 2007 to 2017. Preoperative ultrasound examinations were independently reviewed by 3 radiologists. Adnexal masses were scored for size and volume; overall appearance; presence, thickness, and vascularity of septations; morphology and vascularity of other solid components; and degree of ascites. Characteristics were compared between masses of <5 cm and larger masses and between stage I and stage II cases. Interobserver variability was assessed. Among 111 women identified, 4 had bilateral ovarian involvement, for a total of 115 adnexal masses characterized by ultrasound examination. The mean age at diagnosis was 61.8 years (range, 42-91 years). The median mass size was 9.6 cm (range, 2.2-23.6 cm) with 87% of cases having a mass size of 5 cm. A mixed cystic and solid appearance was most common (77.4%), but a completely solid appearance was more frequently seen for tumors of <5 cm compared with larger tumors (26.7% vs 13.0%). Solid components other than septations were seen in 97.4% of cases. The characteristics of stage I and II cases were similar other than ascites, which was more commonly seen in stage II cases (18.0% vs 3.1%, respectively). Interobserver concordance was high for size and volume measurements (correlation coefficients, 0.96-0.99), with moderate agreement observed across the other ultrasound characteristics (Fleiss kappa, 0.45-0.58). In this community-based cohort, early-stage high-grade serous cancers rarely presented as masses of <5 cm or masses without solid components other than septations. Our findings provide additional support for the observation of small masses without solid areas on ultrasound examination.

Outcomes following interventions to sustain body weight in esophageal cancer patients starting preoperative therapy: a retrospective cohort study To improve nutritional status and dysphagia, esophageal cancer patients starting neoadjuvant therapy in advance of curative-intent surgery may receive a jejunostomy tube (J-tube) or esophageal stent, or they may be managed without a feeding modality. We examined percent total weight loss (%TWL), reinterventions, and progression to surgery in relation to these options. The retrospective cohort study included stage II-III esophageal cancer patients diagnosed during 2010-2017 who received J-tube, stent, or nutritional counseling only, without a procedure, when starting chemotherapy or combined modality chemoradiation. Data were obtained from the electronic medical record and chart review. We compared median %TWL between intervention groups and reinterventions using Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Among the 366 patients, median %TWL reached a nadir at 120 days, when it was 7% for patients with no procedure (N=307), and Individual case analysis revealed 72-80% of the patients in the three groups started chemotherapy or chemoradiation as neoadjuvant curative-intent therapy (P difference =0.79). In J-tube patients, the reasons for intervention was anticipation of weight loss in 49% and mitigation of actual weight loss in 15%, whereas 95% of stent patients received the stent for dysphagia (P<0.001). A complication of the procedure was recorded in 85% of stent patients and 74% of J-tube patients (P<0.001). Among those who received no procedure initially, 25% received one later, compared with 15% of J-tube patients and 70% of stent patients who received a second procedure (P<0.001). Progression to surgery was observed in 65% of patients with no procedure, 51% of patients with J-tube, and 40% of stent patients, P=0.28). For stage II-III esophageal cancer patients starting chemotherapy, this study gives evidence that stents were associated with significant %TWL and risk of reintervention. Although J-tube patients returned to baseline weight sooner than those with no procedure, they experienced complications from their J-tubes. For esophageal cancer patients undergoing curative-intent treatment and with acceptable levels of weight loss, no procedure at all may be superior to placing a J-tube in terms of complications, weight loss, and progression to curative-intent surgery.

Association of Cardiovascular Outcomes and Mortality With Sustained Long-Acting Insulin Only vs Long-Acting Plus Short-Acting Insulin Treatment Cardiovascular events and mortality are the principal causes of excess mortality and health care costs for people with type 2 diabetes. No large studies have specifically compared long-acting insulin alone with long-acting plus short-acting insulin with regard to cardiovascular outcomes. To compare cardiovascular events and mortality in adults with type 2 diabetes receiving long-acting insulin who do or do not add short-acting insulin. This retrospective cohort study emulated a randomized experiment in which adults with type 2 diabetes who experienced a qualifying glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 6.8% to 8.5% with long-acting insulin were randomized to continuing treatment with long-acting insulin (LA group) or adding short-acting insulin within 1 year of the qualifying HbA1c level (LA plus SA group). Retrospective data in 4 integrated health care delivery systems from the Health Care Systems Research Network from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2013, were used. Analysis used inverse probability weighting estimation with Super Learner for propensity score estimation. Analyses took place from April 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019. Long-acting insulin alone or with added short-acting insulin within 1 year from the qualifying HbA1c level. Mortality, cardiovascular mortality, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. Among 57 278 individuals (39 279 with data on cardiovascular mortality) with a mean (SD) age of 60.6 (11.5) years, 53.6% men, 43.5% non-Hispanic White individuals, and 4 years of follow-up (median follow-up of 11 [interquartile range, 5-20] calendar quarters), the LA plus SA group was associated with increased all-cause mortality compared with the LA group (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05-1.49) and a decreased risk of acute myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.97). Treatment with long-acting plus short-acting insulin was not associated with increased risks of congestive heart failure, stroke, or cardiovascular mortality. Findings of this retrospective cohort study suggested an increased risk of all-cause mortality and a decreased risk of acute myocardial infarction for the LA plus SA group compared with the LA group. Given the lack of an increase in major cardiovascular events or cardiovascular mortality, the increased all-cause mortality with long-acting plus short-acting insulin may be explained by noncardiovascular 2021 09 01;4(9):e2126605.

Temporal Trends and Hospital Variation in Time-to-Antibiotics Among Veterans Hospitalized With Sepsis It is unclear whether antimicrobial timing for sepsis has changed outside of performance incentive initiatives. To examine temporal trends and variation in time-to-antibiotics for sepsis in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. This observational cohort study included 130 VA hospitals from 2013 to 2018. Participants included all patients admitted to the hospital via the emergency department with sepsis from 2013 to 2018, using a definition adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Adult Sepsis Event definition, which requires evidence of suspected infection, acute organ dysfunction, and systemic antimicrobial therapy within 12 hours of presentation. Data were analyzed from October 6, 2020, to July 1, 2021. Time from presentation to antibiotic administration. The main outcome was differences in time-to-antibiotics across study periods, hospitals, and patient subgroups defined by presenting temperature and blood pressure. Temporal trends in time-to-antibiotics were measured overall and by subgroups. Hospital-level variation in time-to-antibiotics was quantified after adjusting for differences in patient characteristics using multilevel linear regression models. A total of 111 385 hospitalizations for sepsis were identified, including 107 547 men (96.6%) men and 3838 women (3.4%) with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 68 (62-77) years. A total of 7574 patients (6.8%) died in the hospital, and 13 855 patients (12.4%) died within 30 days. Median (IQR) time-to-antibiotics was 3.9 (2.4-6.5) hours but differed by presenting characteristics. Unadjusted median (IQR) time-to-antibiotics decreased over time, from 4.5 (2.7-7.1) hours during 2013 to 2014 to 3.5 (2.2-5.9) hours during 2017 to 2018 (P < .001). In multilevel models adjusted for patient characteristics, median time-to-antibiotics declined by 9.0 (95% CI, 8.8-9.2) minutes per calendar year. Temporal trends in time-to-antibiotics were similar across patient subgroups, but hospitals with faster baseline time-to-antibiotics had less change over time, with hospitals in the slowest tertile decreasing time-to-antibiotics by 16.6 minutes (23.1%) per year, while hospitals in the fastest tertile decreased time-to-antibiotics by 7.2 minutes (13.1%) per year. In the most recent years (2017-2018), median time-to-antibiotics ranged from 3.1 to 6.7 hours across hospitals (after adjustment for patient characteristics), 6.8% of variation in time-to-antibiotics was explained at the hospital level, and odds of receiving antibiotics within 3 hours increased by 65% (95% CI, 56%-77%) for the median patient if moving to a hospital with faster time-to-antibiotics. This cohort study across nationwide VA hospitals found that time-to-antibiotics for sepsis has declined over time. However, there remains significant variability in time-to-antibiotics not explained by patient characteristics, suggesting potential unwarranted practice variation in sepsis treatment. Efforts to further accelerate time-to-antibiotics must be weighed against risks of overtreatment. Authors: T; Between I Levels During Sepsis and Post-Sepsis Cardiovascular Complications Rationale: Sepsis commonly results in elevated serum troponin levels and increased risk for postsepsis cardiovascular complications; however, the association between troponin levels during sepsis and cardiovascular complications after sepsis is unclear.Objectives: To evaluate the association between serum troponin levels during sepsis and 1 year after sepsis cardiovascular events.Methods: We analyzed adults aged 40 years without preexisting cardiovascular disease within 5 years, admitted with sepsis across 21 hospitals from 2011 to 2017. Peak serum troponin I levels during sepsis were grouped as normal (0.04 ng/ml) or tertiles of abnormal cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models with death as a competing risk were used to assess associations between peak troponin I levels and a composite cardiovascular outcome (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure) in the year following sepsis. Models were adjusted for presepsis and intrasepsis factors considered potential confounders.Measurements and Main Results: Among 14,046 eligible adults with troponin I measured, 2,012 (14.3%) experienced the composite cardiovascular outcome, including 832 (10.9%) patients with normal troponin levels, as compared with 370 (17.3%), 376 (17.6%), and 434 (20.3%) patients within each sequential abnormal troponin tertile, respectively (P < 0.001). Patients within the elevated troponin tertiles had increased risks of adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]troponin0.04-0.09 = 1.37; 95% Among patients without preexisting cardiovascular disease, troponin elevation during sepsis identified patients at increased risk for postsepsis cardiovascular complications. Strategies to mitigate cardiovascular complications among this high-risk subset of patients are warranted. Authors: Garcia, Michael A; Go, Alan S; Liu, Vincent X; Walkey, Allan J; et al.

Reducing Readmissions for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Response to the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program Rationale: In August 2013, the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program announced financial penalties on hospitals with higher than expected risk-adjusted 30-day readmission rates for Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. In October 2014, penalties were imposed. We hypothesized that penalties would be associated with decreased readmissions after COPD hospitalizations. Objectives: To determine whether the announcement and enactment of financial penalties for COPD were associated with decreases in hospital readmissions for COPD. Methods: We used data from California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development to examine unplanned 30-day all-cause and COPD-related readmissions after COPD hospitalization. The preannouncement period was January 2010 to July 2013. The postannouncement period was August 2013 to September 2014. The postenactment period was October 2014 to December 2017. Using interrupted time series, we investigated the immediate change after the intervention (level change) and differences in the preintervention and postintervention trends (slope change). Results: We identified 333,429 index hospitalizations for COPD from 449 California hospitals. Overall, 69% of patients had Medicare insurance. For all-cause readmissions, the level change at announcement was 0.16% (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.07 to 1.38; P = 0.80); the change in slope between preannouncement and postannouncement periods was -0.01% (95% CI, -0.15 to 0.13; P = 0.92). The level change at enactment was 0.29% (95% CI, -1.11 to 1.69; P = 0.68); the in slope between postannouncement and postenactment was 0.04% (95% CI, -0.10 = 0.57). For patients with COPD-related readmissions, the level change at the time of the announcement was 0.09% (95% CI, -0.68 to 0.85; P = 0.83); the in slope was 0.003% (95% CI, -0.08 to 0.09; P = 0.94). The level change at the time of the enactment was 0.22% (95% CI, -0.69 to 1.12; P = 0.64); the in slope was -0.02% (95% CI, -0.10 to 0.07; P = 0.72). Conclusions: We did not detect decreases in either all-cause or COPD-related readmission rates at either time point. Although this would suggest that the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program penalty was ineffective for COPD, COPD readmissions had decreased at an earlier time point (October 2012) when penalties were announced for conditions other than COPD. Based on this, we believe early, broad interventions decreased readmissions, such that no difference was seen at this later time points despite institution of COPD-specific penalties. Authors: Myers, Laura C; Cash, Rebecca; Liu, Vincent of Postpartum Hemorrhage Admission Risk Factor Stratification in a Large Obstetrics Population This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) admission risk criteria for stratifying postpartum hemorrhage risk in a large obstetrics population. Using detailed electronic health record data, we classified 261,964 delivery hospitalizations from Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals between 2010 and 2017 into high-, medium-, and low-risk groups based on CMQCC criteria. We used logistic regression to assess associations between CMQCC risk groups and postpartum hemorrhage using two different postpartum hemorrhage definitions, standard postpartum hemorrhage (blood loss 1,000 mL) and severe postpartum hemorrhage (based on transfusion, laboratory, and blood loss data). Among the low-risk group, we also evaluated associations between additional present-on-admission factors and severe postpartum hemorrhage. Using the standard definition, postpartum hemorrhage occurred in approximately 5% of hospitalizations (n = 13,479), with a rate of 3.2, 10.5, and 10.2% in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups. Severe postpartum hemorrhage occurred in 824 hospitalizations (0.3%), with a rate of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.3% in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups. For either definition, the odds of postpartum hemorrhage were significantly higher in medium- and high-risk groups compared with the low-risk group. Over 40% of postpartum hemorrhages occurred in hospitalizations that were classified as low risk. Among the low-risk group, risk factors including hypertension and diabetes were associated with higher odds of severe postpartum hemorrhage. We found that the CMQCC admission risk assessment criteria stratified women by increasing rates of severe postpartum hemorrhage in our sample, which enables early preparation for many postpartum hemorrhages. However, the CMQCC risk factors missed a substantial proportion of postpartum hemorrhages. Efforts to improve postpartum hemorrhage risk assessment using present-on-admission risk factors should consider inclusion of other nonobstetrical Bayesian Networks Identify the Central Role of Non-judging in Symptoms of Depression. OBJECTIVES: Depression is a highly heterogeneous disorder, and meta-analyses of mindfulness-based interventions show moderate efficacy for reducing depressive symptoms. However, the mechanisms governing their efficacy remain unclear, highlighting the need for hypothesis-generating analyses to guide future research. METHODS: We used Bayesian network analysis in three cross-sectional samples (N = 1135) of undergraduates and participants from the community to identify links between individual symptoms of depression and specific facets of mindfulness. In two exploratory studies, we assessed depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (n = 384) or the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (n = 350) and mindfulness using the Five-Facet Mindfulness Scale. RESULTS: Across these samples and measures, exploratory analyses indicated that non-judging was a central bridge between facets of mindfulness and symptoms of depression. We confirmed this finding in a pre-registered replication (n = 401) using a recently developed confirmatory testing framework for network analysis. Non-judging was consistently a central bridge in the networks and specifically linked to the symptoms of depression related to feelings of failure and worthlessness. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide strong evidence that non-judging is an essential feature of mindfulness in the context of depression and provides direction for future research testing mindfulness-oriented treatment prescriptions for depression.

Reduction in Long-term Mortality after Sleeve Gastrectomy and Gastric Bypass Compared to Non-surgical Patients with Severe Obesity To separately compare the long-term risk of mortality among bariatric surgical patients undergoing either RYGB or SG to large, matched, population-based cohorts of patients with severe obesity who did not undergo surgery. Bariatric surgery has been associated with reduced long-term mortality compared to usual care for severe obesity which is particularly relevant in the COVID-19 era. Most prior studies involved the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) operation and there is less long-term data on the sleeve gastrectomy (SG). In this retrospective, matched cohort study, patients with a body mass index 35 kg/m2 who underwent bariatric surgery from January 2005 to September 2015 in three integrated health systems in the United States were matched to nonsurgical patients on site, age, sex, body mass index, diabetes status, insulin use, race/ethnicity, combined Charlson/Elixhauser comorbidity score, and prior health care utilization, with follow-up through September 2015. Each procedure (RYGB, SG) was compared to its own control group and the two surgical procedures were not directly compared to each other. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis investigated time to all-cause mortality (primary outcome) comparing each of the bariatric procedures to usual care. Secondary outcomes separately examined the incidence of cardiovascular-related death, cancer related-death, and diabetes related-death. Among 72.0%, and 64.5%, respectively. RYGB and SG were each associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to nonsurgical patients at associated with a 5-year risk of cardiovascular- (HR = 0.27; was not enough follow-up time to assess 5-year cause-specific mortality in SG patients, but at 3-years follow up, there was significantly lower risk of cardiovascular- (HR = = 0.15; 95% CI:0.04, 0.53) mortality for SG patients. This study confirms and extends prior findings of an association with better survival following bariatric surgery in RYGB patients compared to controls and separately demonstrates that the SG operation also appears to be associated with lower mortality compared to matched control patients with severe obesity that received usual care. These results help to inform the trade-offs between long-term benefits and risks of bariatric surgery. Authors: Courcoulas, Anita P; Fisher, David P; Coleman, Karen J; et al. Ann Surg. 2021 Aug 13. Evaluation of an intervention targeted with predictive analytics to prevent readmissions in an integrated health system: observational study To determine the associations between a care coordination intervention (the Transitions Program) targeted to patients after hospital discharge and 30 day readmission and mortality in a large, integrated healthcare system. Observational study. 21 hospitals operated by Kaiser Permanente Northern California. 1 539 285 eligible index hospital admissions corresponding to 739 040 unique patients from June 2010 to December 2018. 411 507 patients were discharged post-implementation of the Transitions Program; 80 424 (19.5%) of these patients were at medium or high predicted risk and were assigned to receive the intervention after discharge. Patients admitted to hospital were automatically assigned to be followed by the Transitions Program in the 30 days post-discharge if their predicted risk of 30 day readmission or mortality was greater than 25% on the basis of electronic health record data. Non-elective hospital readmissions and all cause mortality in the 30 days after hospital discharge. Difference-in-differences estimates indicated that the intervention was associated with significantly reduced odds of 30 day non-elective readmission (adjusted odds ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.89 to 0.93; absolute risk reduction 95% confidence interval -2.5%, -3.1% to -2.0%) but not with the odds of 30 day post-discharge mortality (1.00, 0.95 to 1.04). Based on the regression discontinuity estimate, the association with readmission was of similar magnitude (absolute risk reduction -2.7%, -3.2% to -2.2%) among patients at medium risk near the risk threshold used for enrollment. However, the regression discontinuity estimate of the association with post-discharge mortality (-0.7% -1.4% to -0.0%) was significant and suggested benefit in this subgroup of patients. In an integrated health system, the implementation of a comprehensive readmissions prevention intervention was associated with a reduction in 30 day readmission rates. Moreover, there was no association with 30 day post-discharge mortality, except among medium risk patients, where some evidence for benefit was found. Altogether, the study provides evidence to suggest the effectiveness of readmission prevention interventions in community settings, but further research might be required to confirm the findings beyond this setting.

Adolescent depression is a clinically relevant concern that has major implications for mental and physical health. The trajectory of depressive symptoms among adolescents suggests that there is likely variability throughout this developmental period. The aim of the study was to assess the longitudinal relationship between individual symptoms of depression among early and middle adolescents to provide guidance for future research investigating targeted intervention efforts. Data were extracted from electronic medical records (2015-2017) from a pediatric primary care clinic in an urban setting. Cross-Lagged Panel Network analysis was used to evaluate symptoms of depression measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) measured twice over a 1-year period among early adolescents (ages 11-13 years; n = 309) and middle adolescents (ages 14-16 years; n = 255). The sample was predominantly Hispanic (90%) and 56% female. The analyses highlighted key differences and similarities between early and middle adolescence, largely focused on the role of suicidal ideation and tightly linked with feelings of failure and appetitive disturbance. In early adolescence suicidal ideation was highly likely to lead to other symptoms. In middle adolescence, however, suicidal ideation no longer had connections to other symptoms and instead the strongest connections were toward suicidal ideation. Interestingly, across both early and middle adolescence feelings of failure and appetitive disturbance were highly likely to lead to suicidal ideation. These exploratory findings highlight several longitudinal associations between early and middle adolescence that provide insight into differences and similarities regarding how symptoms might progress within those developmental periods. Taken together these results can provide direction for future research to evaluate brief, targeted interventions for adolescents. 2021 Aug 4. Evaluation of Vaccination Strategies to Compare Efficient and Equitable Vaccine Allocation by Race and Ethnicity Across Time Identifying the most efficient COVID-19 vaccine allocation strategy may substantially reduce hospitalizations and save lives while ensuring an equitable vaccine distribution. To simulate the association of different vaccine allocation strategies with COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality and their distribution across racial and ethnic groups. We developed and internally validated the risk of COVID-19 infection and risk of hospitalization models on randomly split training and validation data sets. These were used in a computer simulation study of vaccine prioritization among adult health plan members who were drawn from an integrated health care delivery system. The study was conducted from January 3, 2021, to June 1, 2021, in Oakland, California, and the data were analyzed during the same period. We simulated the association of different vaccine allocation strategies, including (1) random, (2) a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proxy, (3) age based, and (4) combinations of models for the risk of adverse outcomes (CRS) and COVID-19 infection (PROVID), with COVID-19-related hospitalizations between May 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, that were randomly permuted by month across 250 simulations and assessed vaccine allocation by race and ethnicity and the neighborhood deprivation index across time. The study included 3 202 679 adult patients (mean [SD] age, 48.2 [18.0] years; 1 637 women 525 042 [47.6%]; 611 154 Asian [19.1%], 206 363 Black [6.4%], 642 344 Hispanic [20.1%], and 1 390 638 White individuals [43.4%]), of whom 36 137 (1.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. A risk-based strategy (CRS/PROVID) showed the largest avoidable followed CDC proxy (4085; 95% CI, 2805-5109) strategies. Random vaccination showed substantially lower reductions in adverse outcomes. Risk-based strategies also showed the largest number of avoidable COVID-19 deaths (joint CRS/PROVID) and household transmissions. Risk-based (PROVID) and CDC proxy strategies were estimated to vaccinate the highest percentage of Hispanic and Black patients in 8 months (joint CRS/PROVID: 642 570 [100%] Hispanic, 185 530 [90%] Black; PROVID: 570 [100%] 198 480 [96%] proxy: 605 770 [95%] Hispanic and 151 772 [74%] Black) compared with an age-based approach (438 423 [68%] Hispanic, 154 714 [75%] Black). Overall, the PROVID and joint CRS/PROVID risk-based strategies were estimated to be followed by the most patients from areas with high neighborhood deprivation index being vaccinated early. In this simulation modeling study of adults from a large integrated health care delivery system, risk-based strategies were associated with the largest estimated reductions in COVID-19 hospitalizations, deaths, and household transmissions compared with the CDC proxy and age-based strategies, with a higher proportion of Hispanic and Black patients were estimated to be vaccinated early in the process compared with the CDC strategy.

Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients evaluated in the emergency department: A retrospective cohort study of 801 cases Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has extracted devastating tolls. Despite its pervasiveness, robust information on disease characteristics in the emergency department (ED) and how that information predicts clinical course remain limited. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the first ED visit from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in our health system, from February 21, 2020 to April 5, 2020. We reviewed each patient's ED visit(s) and included the first visit with symptoms consistent with COVID-19. We collected demographic, clinical, and treatment variables from electronic health records and structured manual chart review. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between patient characteristics and 2 primary outcomes: a critical outcome and hospitalization from index visit. Our critical outcome was defined as death or advanced respiratory support (high flow nasal cannula or greater) within 21 days. Of the first 1030 encounters, 801 met our inclusion criteria: 15% were over age 75 years, 47% were female, and 24% were non-Hispanic white. We found 161 (20%) had a critical outcome and 393 (49%) were hospitalized. Independent predictors of a critical outcome included a history of hypertension, abnormal chest x-ray, elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), measured fever, and abnormal respiratory vital signs (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation). Independent predictors of hospitalization included abnormal pulmonary auscultation, elevated BUN, measured fever, and abnormal respiratory vital signs. In this large, diverse study of ED patients with COVID-19, we have identified numerous clinical characteristics that have independent associations with critical illness and hospitalization.

Race/ethnicity moderates associations between depressive symptoms and diet composition among U.S. adults Although depression is associated with poorer overall diet quality, few studies have examined its association with levels of particular macronutrients, and none have examined moderation by race/ethnicity. The present study examined (a) associations between depressive symptom severity and nine indices of diet composition and (b) whether race/ethnicity moderates these associations. Participants were 28,940 adults (mean age = 49 years, 52% female, 52% nonwhite) from NHANES 2005-2018. Depressive symptom severity was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Nine diet composition indices were derived from the average of two 24-hr dietary recalls (e.g., total energy, total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, sugar, fiber, and protein). Separate linear regression analyses revealed that PHQ-9 total was positively associated with saturated fat and sugar and negatively associated with protein and fiber. Moderation by race/ethnicity was observed (interaction ps < .05). Among non-Hispanic Whites, PHQ-9 total was positively associated with sugar and negatively associated with protein and fiber. Among non-Hispanic Blacks, PHQ-9 total was positively associated with total energy, total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, total carbohydrate, and sugar. Among Mexican Americans, PHQ-9 was positively associated with saturated fat. Among other Hispanics, PHQ-9 total was negatively associated with fiber, protein, and total, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat. Findings from this large, nationally representative sample demonstrate that associations between depressive symptom severity and diet composition vary by race/ethnicity. Critically, an unhealthy diet composition pattern may be one mechanism explaining the excess risk of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases in individuals with depression, especially in non-Hispanic Blacks.

Epidemiologic Analysis of Chilblains Cohorts Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic Beginning in March 2020, case reports and case series linked the COVID-19 pandemic with an increased occurrence of chilblains, but this association has not been evaluated in an epidemiologic study. To assess whether a correlation exists between COVID-19 incidence and chilblains incidence. A retrospective cohort study was conducted within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California system from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020; health plan members of all ages were included. COVID-19 incidence in 207 location-months, representing 23 geographic locations in northern California across 9 months. Chilblains incidence was the main outcome. The association of chilblains incidence with COVID-19 incidence across the 207 location-months was measured using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Of 780 patients with chilblains reported during the pandemic, 464 were female (59.5%); mean (SD) age was 36.8 (21.8) years. COVID-19 incidence was correlated with chilblains incidence at 207 location-months (Spearman coefficient 0.18; P = .01). However, only 17 of 456 (3.7%) patients with chilblains tested during the pandemic were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and only 9 of 456 (2.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 6 weeks of the chilblains diagnosis. Test results of 1 of 97 (1.0%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Latinx patients were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 but not by chilblains. This cohort study found that in northern California, the incidence of chilblains increased during the pandemic but was correlated weakly with the incidence of COVID-19 across 207 location-months. These findings may have resulted from a causal role of COVID-19, increased care-seeking by patients with chilblains during the pandemic, or changes in behavior during shelter in place. Authors: McCleskey, Patrick E; Laparoscopic Technique for Inguinal Hernia Repair: A Mixed Methods Study Purpose: We studied adoption of an innovative laparoscopic technique for pediatric inguinal hernia repair by pediatric surgeons and pediatric urologists following dissemination of evidence for its benefits. Methods: This mixed methods study included children who received inguinal hernia repairs during 2017-2019 and their surgeons. We examined surgeons' adoption and use of the innovative technique and rates of ipsilateral recurrence and metachronous contralateral repair. In-depth interviews with surgeons were used to identify themes regarding attitudes and practices regarding the adoption of surgical innovations. Results: No ipsilateral recurrences were noted among open repairs after 1.5 years of average follow-up, while 1.54% (7/453) of unilateral and 0.50% (3/606 sides) of bilateral innovative surgeries required ipsilateral repair after 1.3 years of average follow-up. Among unilateral cases, metachronous contralateral repairs were performed in 1.63% (8/490) of open and 0.44% (2/453) of innovative surgeries. Surgeon interviews identified approaches to continued learning and change; the role of departmental culture, norms, and resources; and technical issues specific to pediatric surgery and pediatric inguinal hernia repair. Conclusions: Outcomes may have improved over time as a consequence of learning. Differences among surgeons and departments influenced the speed of adoption. Surgeons linked the collegial model used when adopting the new technique to the apprenticeship model used during their training. We propose research into the collegial model to improve translation of evidence-based surgical innovations into practice. Level of Evidence: Level Altschuler, Andrea; Aug;31(8):947-953.

Outcomes among acute heart failure emergency department patients by preserved vs. reduced ejection fraction This study aimed to assess short-term outcomes among emergency department (ED) patients with acute heart failure (AHF) by preserved (50%) vs. reduced (<50%) ejection fraction (EF). We conducted a retrospective, multicentre study of adult ED patients with AHF from 2017 to 2018 in an integrated healthcare system with 21 hospitals. Among patients with known EF, our primary outcome was 30 day all-cause mortality, comparing patients with heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) and heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF), adjusted for known risk factors. We ran separate multivariate regression models to compare 30 day mortality between HFpEF and HFrEF patients stratified by ED disposition (admit, observe, and discharge). Our secondary outcomes were adjusted 30 day all-cause return hospital admission and rates of non-fatal serious adverse events, including new intra-aorta balloon pump, endotracheal intubation, renal failure requiring dialysis, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization. We conducted a sensitivity analysis among patients with EF 40% and compared our primary and secondary outcomes among patients with EF 40% with those with EF 50%. Among the 26 050 total ED encounters for AHF, 15 275 (58.6%) had known EF and 62.4% had HFpEF. The mean age was 76, 49.6% were women, and 60.5% were white. We found that 62.4% of patients were admitted, 18.3% were observed, and 19.3% were discharged from the ED. The 30 day all-cause mortality rate was lowest among discharged patients (3.9%), intermediate among observed patients (5.9%), and highest among admitted patients (13.9%). Overall, the adjusted 30 day mortality rate was significantly higher among HFpEF patients compared with HFrEF patients (10.2% vs. 8.4%, P = 0.0004). HFpEF patients had higher mortality regardless of ED disposition, although the difference was only significant among admitted patients. The adjusted 30 day return hospital admission rates were not significantly different between HFpEF and HFrEF patients (17.9% vs. 17.8%, P = 0.89). The adjusted 30 day non-fatal serious adverse event rates were significantly higher among HFrEF patients compared with HFpEF patients (13.7% vs. 11.1%, P < 0.0001), driven by myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization. We found that 3692 patients had EF 40%. Patients with EF 50% had significantly higher adjusted 30 day mortality rates compared with those with EF 40% (10.2% vs. 8.4%, P < 0.05). In a contemporary population, almost three quarters of ED patients with AHF and known EF have HFpEF. These patients have higher 30 day adjusted mortality compared with those with HFrEF. Further studies might evaluate the underlying factors associated with this difference and target interventions to improve outcomes. B; Reed, Fail. 08;8(4):2889-2898. Epub 2021-05-12. Association of chronic anticoagulant and antiplatelet use on disease severity in SARS-COV-2 of a healthcare system COVID Hotspotting Score in California: an observational study with prospective validation To examine the value of health systems data as indicators of emerging COVID-19 activity. Observational study of health system indicators for the COVID Hotspotting Score (CHOTS) with prospective validation. An integrated healthcare delivery system in Northern California including 21 hospitals and 4.5 million members. The CHOTS incorporated 10 variables including four major (cough/cold calls, emails, new positive COVID-19 tests, COVID-19 hospital census) and six minor (COVID-19 calls, respiratory infection and COVID-19 routine and urgent visits, and respiratory viral testing) indicators assessed with change point detection and slope metrics. We quantified cross-correlations lagged by 7-42 days between CHOTS and standardised COVID-19 hospital census using observational data from 1 April to 31 May 2020 and two waves of prospective data through 21 March 2021. Through 30 September 2020, peak cross-correlation between CHOTS and COVID-19 hospital census occurred with a 28-day lag at 0.78; at 42 days, the correlation was 0.69. Lagged correlation between medical centre CHOTS and their COVID-19 census was highest at 42 days for one facility (0.63), at 35 days for nine facilities (0.52-0.73), at 28 days for eight facilities (0.28-0.74) and at 14 days for two facilities (0.73-0.78). The strongest correlation for individual indicators was 0.94 (COVID-19 census) and 0.90 (new positive COVID-19 tests) lagged 1-14 days and 0.83 for COVID-19 calls and urgent clinic visits lagged 14-28 days. Cross-correlation was similar (0.73) with a 35-day lag using prospective validation from 1 October 2020 to 21 March 2021. Passively collected health system indicators were strongly correlated with forthcoming COVID-19 hospital census up to 6 weeks before three successive COVID-19 waves. These tools could inform communities, health systems and public health officials to identify, prepare for and mitigate emerging COVID-19 activity. Authors: Liu, Vincent X; Thai, Epub 2021-07-26. Singular and combined effects of transcranial infrared laser stimulation and exposure therapy on pathological fear: a randomized clinical trial. BACKGROUND: Preclinical findings suggest that transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS) improves fear extinction learning and cognitive function by enhancing prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygen metabolism. These findings prompted our investigation of treating pathological fear using this non-invasive stimulation approach either alone to the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), or to the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) in combination with exposure therapy. METHODS: Volunteers with pathological fear of either enclosed spaces, contamination, public speaking, or anxiety-related bodily sensations were recruited for this randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled trial with four arms: (a) Exposure + TILS_vmPFC (n = 29), (b) Exposure + sham TILS_vmPFC (n = 29), (c) TILS_dlPFC alone (n = 26), or (d) Sham TILS _dlPFC alone (n = 28). Post-treatment assessments occurred immediately following treatment. Follow-up assessments occurred 2 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: A total of 112 participants were randomized [age range: 18-63 years; 96 females (85.71%)]. Significant interactions of Group x Time and Group x Context indicated differential treatment effects on retention (i.e. between time-points, averaged across contexts) and on generalization (i.e. between contexts, averaged across time-points), respectively. Among the monotherapies, TILS_dlPFC outperformed SHAM_dlPFC in the initial context, b = -13.44, 95% CI (-25.73 to -1.15), p = 0.03. Among the combined treatments, differences between EX + TILS_vmPFC and EX + SHAM_vmPFC were non-significant across all contrasts. CONCLUSIONS: TILS to the dlPFC, one of the PFC regions implicated in emotion regulation, resulted in a context-specific benefit as a monotherapy for reducing fear. Contrary to prediction, TILS to the vmPFC, a region implicated in fear extinction memory consolidation, did not enhance exposure therapy and Readmission Rates for Medicare Beneficiaries with Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Authors: Jul 16. Equitably Allocating Resources During Crises: Racial Differences in Mortality Prediction Models Rationale: Crisis standards of care (CSCs) guide critical care resource allocation during crises. Most recommend ranking patients on the basis of their expected in-hospital mortality using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, but it is unknown how SOFA or other acuity scores perform among patients of different races. Objectives: To test the prognostic accuracy of the SOFA score and version 2 of the Laboratory-based Acute Physiology Score (LAPS2) among Black and white patients. Methods: We included Black and white patients admitted for sepsis or acute respiratory failure at 27 hospitals. We calculated the discrimination and calibration for in-hospital mortality of SOFA, LAPS2, and modified versions of each, including categorical SOFA groups recommended in a popular CSC and a SOFA score without creatinine to reduce the influence of race. Measurements and Main Results: Of 113,158 patients, 27,644 (24.4%) identified as Black. The LAPS2 demonstrated higher discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.68-0.69). The LAPS2 was also better calibrated than the SOFA score, but both underestimated in-hospital mortality for white patients and overestimated in-hospital mortality for Black patients. Thus, in a simulation using observed mortality, 81.6% of Black patients were included in lower-priority CSC categories, and 9.4% of all Black patients were erroneously excluded from receiving the highest prioritization. The SOFA score without creatinine reduced racial miscalibration. Conclusions: Using SOFA in CSCs may lead to racial disparities in resource allocation. More equitable mortality prediction scores are needed. Authors: Ashana, Deepshikha Charan; Anesi, Scott D Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2021 07 15;204(2):178-186. Linking racism and homonegativity to healthcare system distrust among young men of color who have sex with men: Evidence from the Healthy Young Men's (HYM) study Experiences with racism predict healthcare system distrust among people of color, but Black and Latino young men who have sex with men (YMSM) also experience overlapping forms of stigma associated with their sexual identities and behaviors (i.e., homonegativity and internalized homonegativity). These forms of minority stress may drive healthcare system distrust among Black and Latino YMSM but have received far less attention. To examine the associations of racism, homonegativity, and internalized homonegativity with healthcare system distrust among a community sample of Black and Latino YMSM. Data came from waves 2-4 (years 2017-2018) of the Healthy Young Men's study, a longitudinal cohort study of Black and Latino YMSM living in Los Angeles County. Data across waves (n = 424, nobs = 1272) were combined and analyzed using a fixed effects approach and adjusting for repeated measures across participants. A series of regression models that added sets of covariates (demographics, syndemic indicators, and health-related factors) were tested to examine associations of racism, homonegativity, and internalized homonegativity with healthcare system distrust. Adjusting for demographics and syndemic indicators, racism, but not homonegativity or internalized homonegativity, was associated with healthcare system distrust. Adjustment for health-related factors had little impact on results. Among Black and Latino YMSM, greater exposure to racism is associated with greater healthcare system distrust. Efforts to strengthen healthcare system trust should explicitly target the institutional policies that disproportionately harm people of color. Authors: Hsueh L; Layland EK; 2021-07-10. ASO Visual Abstract: Volume Matters-Longitudinal Retrospective Cohort Study of Outcomes Following Consultation and Standardization of Adrenal Surgery Authors: Rahbari, Retrospective Cohort Study Comparing Infliximab-dyyb and Infliximab in Biologic-Naive Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the United States Real-world assessments of biosimilars are needed to understand their effectiveness and safety in practice settings that may differ from those seen in clinical trials or healthcare systems in different countries. To assess the effectiveness and safety of a biosimilar (infliximab-dyyb) and its reference product (infliximab) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the United States. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of biologic-naive patients with IBD who started treatment with infliximab-dyyb or infliximab. The study included 3206 patients identified through electronic health records in a US integrated healthcare delivery system. The effectiveness outcome was a composite of IBD-related surgery, IBD-related emergency room visit, and IBD-related hospitalization within 12 months of initiation. Safety outcomes included incidence of any or serious infection, cancer, acute liver dysfunction, and tuberculosis. We used a non-inferiority test with an upper-limit margin of 10% to analyze effectiveness. Doubly robust methods incorporating Cox proportional hazard regression with standardized inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to analyze both effectiveness and safety outcomes. The composite effectiveness outcome occurred in 107 of 870 patients (12.3%) in the infliximab-dyyb and 379 of 2336 patients (16.2%) in the infliximab groups. Infliximab-dyyb was non-inferior (P < .01) and was not different (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81; confidence interval [CI] 0.65-1.01; P = .06) to infliximab. Safety outcomes were not different between infliximab-dyyb and infliximab for any infections (HR 1.01; CI 0.86-1.17; P = .95), serious infections (HR 0.83; CI 0.54-1.26; P = .38), cancers (HR 0.83; CI 0.44-1.54; P = .55), and tuberculosis (HR 0.59; CI 0.10-3.55; P = .57). Initiation of infliximab-dyyb was non-inferior to infliximab among biologic-naive patients with IBD in an US integrated healthcare delivery system. Authors: Smith, Joshua T; Jul;3(3):otab051.

Reassessment of Glycemic Goals in Older Patients With Dementia-More Work Is Needed to Do Less Authors: Claytor, Jennifer D; Grant, Richard W JAMA Intern Med. 2021 07 01;181(7):994-995. The Role of Community-Based Organizations in Improving Chronic Care for Safety-Net Populations Social determinants of health (SDoH) influence health outcomes and contribute to disparities in chronic disease in vulnerable populations. To inform health system strategies to address SDoH, we conducted a multi-stakeholder qualitative study to capture the multi-level influences on health for those living in socio-economically deprived contexts. Varied qualitative inquiry methods - in-depth interviews, participant-led neighborhood tours, and clinic visit observations - involving a total of 23 participants (10 patients with chronic illnesses in San Francisco neighborhoods with high chronic disease rates, 10 community leaders serving the same neighborhoods, and 3 providers from San Francisco's public health care delivery system). Qualitative analyses were guided by the Chronic Care Model (CCM). Several key themes emerged from this study. First, we enumerated a large array, neighborhood resources such as food pantries, parks/green spaces, and financial assistance services that interact with patients' self-management. Health service providers leveraged these resources to address patients' social needs but suggested a clear need for expanding this work. Second, analyses uncovered multiple essential mechanisms by which community-based organizations (CBOs) provided and navigated among many neighborhood health resources, including social support and culturally aligned knowledge. Finally, many examples of how structural issues such as institutional racism, transportation, and housing inequities are intertwined with health and social service delivery were elucidated. The results contribute new evidence toward the community domain of the CCM. Health care systems must intentionally partner with CBOs to address SDoH and improve community resources for chronic care management, and directly address structural issues to make progress.

The effect of mail order pharmacy outreach on older patients with diabetes Authors: Gong, Chelsea; Endophthalmitis prophylaxis failures in patients injected with intracameral antibiotic during cataract surgery To estimate the association of cefuroxime and moxifloxacin in relation to the occurrence of endophthalmitis following phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Retrospective clinical cohort study. We studied patients with noncomplex phacoemulsification cataract surgery in Kaiser Permanente Northern California during 2014-2019. Data were obtained for acute, postoperative endophthalmitis within 90 days of phacoemulsification, including culture and antibiogram results, intracameral and topical antibiotic agent, and dose. In a post hoc analysis, we also examined preoperative anterior chamber depth (ACD) and postoperative anterior chamber volume Of 216,141 0.020% of cefuroxime eyes (relative risk 1.62 with 95% CI 0.82-3.20, P = .16). Of the 34 (0.016%) cases of endophthalmitis, cefuroxime 1 mg was injected into 13 eyes and moxifloxacin 0.1% into 21 eyes. Organisms with antibiograms were identified in 12 (35%) cases. Of these, bacteria recovered from cefuroxime-injected eyes were resistant to cefuroxime in all cases (4/4), with Enterococcus comprising half of these. In eyes injected with moxifloxacin 0.1%, 6 out of 7 organisms were sensitive to moxifloxacin injected with 0.1 mL and in 1 eye injected with 1 mL. Streptococcus was the most common organism recovered (6/9) in moxifloxacin-injected eyes. Preoperative ACD and postoperative calculated ACV were higher in eyes injected with moxifloxacin. Endophthalmitis cases with positive cultures were generally related to organism resistance in cefuroxime eyes but to sensitive organisms in moxifloxacin eyes. Moxifloxacin doses may have been insufficient in eyes with larger ACV. Authors: Shorstein, Neal H; 2021-02-08. Developing and Testing Automatic Models of Patient Communicative Health Literacy Using Linguistic Features: Findings from the ECLIPPSE study Patients with diabetes and limited health literacy (HL) may have suboptimal communication exchange with their health care providers and be at elevated risk of adverse health outcomes. These difficulties are generally attributed to patients' reduced ability to both communicate and understand health-related ideas as well as physicians' lack of skill in identifying those with limited HL. Understanding and identifying patients with barriers posed by lower HL to improve healthcare delivery and outcomes is an important research avenue. However, doing so using traditional methods has proven difficult and infeasible to scale. This study using corpus analyses, expert human ratings of HL, and natural language processing (NLP) approaches to estimate HL at the individual patient level. The goal of the study is to better understand HL from a linguistic perspective and to open new research areas to enhance population management and individualized care. Specifically, this study examines HL as a function of patients' demonstrated ability to communicate health-related information to their providers via secure messages. The study develops an NLP-based HL model and validates the model by predicting patient-related events such as medical outcomes and hospitalizations. Results indicate that the developed model predicts human ratings of HL with ~80% accuracy. Validation indicates that lower HL patients are more likely to be nonwhite and have lower educational attainment. In addition, patients with lower HL suffered more negative health outcomes and had higher healthcare service utilization. Authors: and age group differences in cardiometabolic risks among adults in a Northern California health plan: a cross-sectional study In the U.S., the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension are higher among African American/Black (Black), Latinx, and Filipino adults than non-Hispanic White (White) and Chinese adults. We compared the racial/ethnic-specific prevalence of several modifiable cardiometabolic risks in an insured adult population to identify behaviors that may drive racial/ethnic differences in cardiometabolic health. This cross-sectional study used data for middle-aged (35-64) and older (65-79) Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) adult health plan members. Smoking status and BMI were derived from electronic health record data. Weighted pooled self-reported data from the 2014/2015 and 2017 KPNC Member Health Survey cycles were used to estimate daily number of servings of fruits/vegetables, general sodium avoidance, sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption frequency, alcohol use within daily recommended limit, weekly exercise frequency, and number of hours of sleep daily. Age-standardized estimates of all cardiometabolic risks were produced for middle-aged and older-aged women and men in the five racial/ethnic groups. Analyses focused on racial/ethnic differences within age-gender groups and gender and age group differences within racial/ethnic groups. In both age groups, Black, Latinx, and Filipino adults were more likely than White and Chinese adults to have overweight and obesity and were less likely to engage in health promoting dietary (fruit/vegetable and SSB consumption, sodium avoidance (women only)) and sleep behaviors. Middle-aged Black and Filipino men were more likely than White men to be current smokers. Less racial/ethnic variation was seen in exercise frequency. Significant gender differences were observed for dietary behaviors overall and within racial/ethnic groups, especially among middle-aged adults; however, these gender differences were smaller for sleep and exercise. Age differences within gender and racial/ethnic groups were less consistent. Racial/ethnic and gender differences in these behaviors were also seen in the subsample of adults with diabetes and/or hypertension and in the subsample of adults who reported they were trying to engage in health promoting behaviors. Black, Latinx, and Filipino adults were more likely than White and Chinese adults to report dietary and sleep behaviors associated with development and worsening of cardiometabolic conditions, with men exhibiting poorer dietary behaviors than women.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: People with anxiety disorders are more likely to smoke and less likely to succeed when they try to quit. Anxiety sensitivity may underlie both phenomena, such that people with high anxiety sensitivity react to interoceptive distress by avoidance. This study aimed to test the efficacy of an exercise program that induced interoceptive distress and thereby created tolerance to this distress in a safe environment. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial at four YMCA branches in Austin, Texas, USA. Participants [n = 150; 130 (86.7%) white; 101 38.6, standard deviation (SD)age = 10.4] were adult, daily smokers with high anxiety sensitivity motivated to quit smoking, who reported no regular moderate-intensity exercise. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were assigned a YMCA personal trainer who guided them through a 15-week intervention aerobic exercise program. Participants assigned to the personalized intervention trained at 60-85% of their heart rate reserve (HRR), whereas participants assigned to the control intervention trained at 20-40% of their HRR. Participants in both groups received standard behavioral support and nicotine replacement therapy. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was biologically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 6-month follow-up. FINDINGS: Sixty-one per cent of participants were available at the 6-month follow-up. PPA at 6 months was higher in the personalized intervention than the control intervention [27.6 versus 14.8%; odds ratio (OR) = 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.28, 3.80, P = 0.005], assuming missing at random. Anxiety sensitivity declined in both groups with no evidence that this differed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: An exercise program of high intensity increased abstinence from smoking in people with high anxiety sensitivity, but may not have done so by reducing anxiety sensitivity.

Descriptive examination of secure messaging in a longitudinal cohort of diabetes patients in the ECLIPPSE study The substantial expansion of secure messaging (SM) via the patient portal in the last decade suggests that it is becoming a standard of care, but few have examined SM use longitudinally. We examined SM patterns among a diverse cohort of patients with diabetes (N = 19 921) and the providers they exchanged messages with within a large, integrated health system over 10 years (2006-2015), linking patient demographics to SM use. We found a 10-fold increase in messaging volume. There were dramatic increases overall and for patient subgroups, with a majority of patients (including patients with lower income or with self-reported limited health literacy) messaging by 2015. Although more physicians than nurses and other providers messaged throughout the study, the distribution of health professions using SM changed over time. Given this rapid increase in SM, deeper understanding of optimizing the value of patient and provider engagement, while managing workflow and training challenges, is 2021 12;28(6):1252-1258. Association of Real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring With Glycemic Control and Acute Metabolic Events Among Patients With Insulin-Treated Diabetes Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is recommended for patients with type 1 diabetes; observational evidence for CGM in patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes is lacking. To estimate clinical outcomes of real-time CGM initiation. Exploratory retrospective cohort study of changes in outcomes associated with real-time CGM initiation, estimated using a difference-in-differences analysis. A total of 41 753 participants with insulin-treated diabetes (5673 type 1; 36 080 type 2) receiving care from a Northern California integrated health care delivery system (2014-2019), being treated with insulin, self-monitoring their blood glucose levels, and having no prior CGM use were included. Initiation vs noninitiation of real-time CGM (reference group). Ten end points measured during the 12 months before and 12 months after baseline: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); hypoglycemia (emergency department or hospital utilization); hyperglycemia (emergency department or hospital utilization); HbA1c levels lower than 7%, lower than 8%, and higher than 9%; 1 emergency department encounter or more for any reason; 1 hospitalization or more for any reason; and number of outpatient visits and telephone visits. The real-time CGM initiators included included 37 947 patients 63.4 [SD, 13.4 years]; 49% female; was lower real-time prebaseline rates declined among CGM -0.40%; 95% CI, -0.48% to -0.32%; < Hypoglycemia declined among real-time CGM initiators from 5.1% to -2.7%; 95% CI, -4.4% to -1.1%; P = .001). There were also statistically significant differences in the adjusted net changes in the proportion of patients with HbA1c lower than 7% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 9.6%; 95% CI, 7.1% to 12.2%; (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 13.1%; 95% CI, 10.2% to 16.1%; P < and than 9% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -7.1%; 95% CI, -9.5% to -4.6%; P < .001) and in the number of outpatient visits (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -0.4; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.2; P < .001) and telephone visits (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.4; P < .001). Initiation of real-time CGM was not associated with statistically significant changes in rates of hyperglycemia, emergency department visits for any reason, or hospitalizations for any reason. In this retrospective cohort study, insulin-treated patients with diabetes selected by physicians for real-time continuous glucose monitoring compared with noninitiators had significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c and reductions in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for hypoglycemia, but no significant change in emergency department visits or hospitalizations for hyperglycemia or for any reason. Because of the observational study design, findings may have been susceptible to selection bias. within ethnic group designation: comparing risk factors and health indicators between Iranian and Arab Americans in Northern California The Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) ethnic group is a diverse group composed of two primary subsets in the United States: Iranian and Arab Americans. We aimed to compare health risk factors, chronic health conditions, and mental health conditions of Iranian and Arab American adults in Northern California. We used cross-sectional electronic health record (EHR) data from a 2016 Northern California health plan study cohort to compare adults classified as Iranian or Arab American based on ethnicity, language, or surname. We produced age-standardized prevalence estimates of obesity, smoking, hyperlipidemia, prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension, depression, and anxiety for Iranian and Arab American men and women by age group (35-44, 45-64, and 65-84) and overall (35-84). We used generalized linear models to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) to compare Iranian and Arab American adults ages 35-84 on all health indicators. Compared to Arab Americans, Iranian Americans had a lower prevalence of obesity (PR: 0.77, 95% a higher 95% CI: 1.06, (PR; and anxiety (PR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.42, 1.63). Similar patterns were observed for men and women. This work supports the need to collect granular data on race and ethnicity within the MENA ethnic group to improve identification in clinical care settings and population health reporting to better address the physical and mental health needs of different 05;21(1):1074.

Association of Type 1 Diabetes and Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events and Risk of Dementia To determine whether severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events are associated with longitudinal dementia risk in older adults with type 1 diabetes. A longitudinal cohort study followed 2,821 members of an integrated healthcare delivery system with type 1 diabetes from 1997-2015. Hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events requiring emergency room or hospitalization were abstracted from medical records beginning 1/1/1996 through cohort entry. Participants were followed for dementia diagnosis through 9/30/2015. Dementia risk was examined using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age (as timescale), sex, race/ethnicity, HbA1c, depression, stroke, and nephropathy. Among 2,821 older adults (mean age 56) with type 1 diabetes, 398 (14%) had a history of severe hypoglycemia, 335 (12%) severe hyperglycemia and 87 (3%) both. Over a mean 6.9 years of follow-up, 153 individuals (5.4%) developed dementia. In fully adjusted models, individuals with hypoglycemic events had 66% greater risk of dementia than those without a hypoglycemic event (HR=1.66; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.53), while those with hyperglycemic events >2 times the risk (HR=2.11; 95% CI: 1.24, 3.59) than those without a hyperglycemic event. There was a 6-fold greater risk of dementia in individuals with both severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia versus those with neither (HR=6.20; 95% CI: 3.02, 12.70). For older individuals with type 1 diabetes, severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events are associated with increased future risk of dementia. Whitmer, E Neurology. 2021 Jun 02. Association of Positive Fluid Balance at Discharge After Sepsis Management With 30-Day Readmission Although early fluid administration has been shown to lower sepsis mortality, positive fluid balance has been associated with adverse outcomes. Little is known about associations in non-intensive care unit settings, with growing concern about readmission from excess fluid accumulation in patients with sepsis. To evaluate whether positive fluid balance among non-critically ill patients with sepsis was associated with increased readmission risk, including readmission for heart failure. This multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017, among 57 032 non-critically ill adults hospitalized for sepsis at 21 hospitals across Northern California. Kaiser Permanente Northern California is an integrated health care system with a community-based population of more than 4.4 million members. Statistical analysis was performed from January 1 to December 31, 2019. Intake and output net fluid balance (I/O) measured daily and cumulatively at discharge (positive vs negative). The primary outcome was 30-day readmission. The secondary outcomes were readmission stratified by category and mortality after living discharge. The cohort included 57 032 patients who were hospitalized for sepsis (28 779 women [50.5%]; mean [SD] age, 73.7 [15.5] years). Compared with patients with positive I/O (40 940 [71.8%]), those with negative I/O (16 092 [28.2%]) were older, with increased comorbidity, acute illness severity, preexisting heart failure or chronic kidney disease, diuretic use, and decreased fluid administration volume. During 30-day follow-up, 8719 patients (15.3%) were readmitted and 3639 patients (6.4%) died. There was no difference in readmission between patients with positive vs negative I/O (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.95-1.05). No association was detected between readmission and I/O using continuous, splined, and quadratic function transformations. Positive I/O was associated with decreased heart failure-related readmission (HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.71-0.91]) and increased 30-day mortality (HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.15-1.31]). In this large observational study of non-critically ill patients hospitalized with sepsis, there was no association between positive fluid balance at the time of discharge and readmission. However, these findings may have been limited by variable recording and documentation of fluid intake and output; additional studies are needed to examine the association of fluid status with outcomes in patients with sepsis to reduce readmission risk.

Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Testing and Outcomes : Retrospective Cohort Study in an Integrated Health System Racial disparities exist in outcomes after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To evaluate the contribution of race/ethnicity in SARS-CoV-2 testing, infection, and outcomes. Retrospective cohort study (1 February 2020 to 31 May 2020). Integrated health care delivery system in Northern California. Adult health plan members. Age, sex, neighborhood deprivation index, comorbid conditions, acute physiology indices, and race/ethnicity; SARS-CoV-2 testing and incidence of positive test results; and hospitalization, illness severity, and mortality. Among 3 481 716 eligible members, 42.0% were White, 6.4% African American, 19.9% Hispanic, and 18.6% Asian; 13.0% were of other or unknown race. Of eligible members, 91 212 (2.6%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 3686 had positive results (overall incidence, 105.9 per 100 000 persons; by racial group, White, 55.1; African American, 123.1; Hispanic, 219.6; Asian, 111.7; other/unknown, 79.3). African American persons had the highest unadjusted testing and mortality rates, White persons had the lowest testing rates, and those with other or unknown race had the lowest mortality rates. Compared with White persons, adjusted testing rates among non-White persons were marginally higher, but infection rates were significantly higher; adjusted odds ratios [aORs] for African American persons, Hispanic persons, Asian persons, and persons of other/unknown race were 2.01 (95% CI, 1.75 2.19 (CI, 1.98 to 2.42), and 1.57 (CI, 1.38 to 1.78), respectively. Geographic analyses showed that infections clustered in areas with higher proportions of non-White persons. Compared with White persons, adjusted hospitalization rates for African American persons, Hispanic persons, Asian persons, and persons of other/unknown race were 1.47 (CI, 1.03 to 2.09), 1.42 (CI, 1.11 to 1.82), 1.47 (CI, 1.13 to 1.92), and 1.03 (CI, 0.72 to 1.46), respectively. Adjusted analyses showed no racial differences in inpatient mortality or total mortality during the study period. For testing, comorbid conditions made the greatest relative contribution to model explanatory power (77.9%); race only accounted for 8.1%. Likelihood of infection was largely due to race (80.3%). For other outcomes, age was most important; race only contributed 4.5% for hospitalization, 12.8% for admission illness severity, 2.3% for in-hospital death, and 0.4% for any death. The study involved an insured population in a highly integrated health system. Race was the most important predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection. After infection, race was associated with increased hospitalization risk but not mortality. The Permanente Medical Group, Inc. Authors: Escobar, Gabriel J; Adams, Alyce 06;174(6):786-793.

Yet, little is known about the early experiences of these individuals, starting with communication of the diagnosis. Addressing this knowledge gap is important as this initial interaction may shape subsequent disease-related perceptions and self-management. We examined diagnosis disclosure experiences and initial reactions among younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Purposive sample of adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated healthcare delivery system, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes before age 45 years. We conducted six focus groups between November 2017 and May 2018. Transcribed audio recordings were coded by two coders using thematic analysis. Participants (n = 41) were 38.4 (\u00b1 5.8) years of age; 10 self-identified as Latinx, 12 as Black, 12 as White, and 7 as multiple or other races. We identified variation in diagnosis disclosure experiences, centered on four key domains: (1) participants' sense of preparedness for diagnosis (ranging from expectant to surprised); (2) disclosure setting (including in-person, via phone, via secure message, or via review of results online); (3) perceived provider tone (from nonchalant, to overly fear-centered, to supportive); and (4) participants' emotional reactions to receiving the diagnosis (including acceptance, denial, guilt, and/or fear, rooted in personal and family experience). For younger adults, the experience of receiving a diabetes diagnosis varies greatly. Given the long-term consequences of inadequately managed diabetes and the need for early disease control, effective initial disclosure represents an opportunity to optimize initial care. Our results suggest several opportunities to improve the type 2 diabetes disclosure experience: (1) providing pre-test counseling, (2) identifying patient-preferred settings for receiving the news, and (3) developing initial care strategies that acknowledge and address the emotional distress triggered by this life-altering, chronic Med. 2021 06;36(6):1622-1628.

Three Learning Organizations in Cataract Surgery: The Example of Intracameral Antibiotic Injection The recent systematic adoption of intracameral antibiotic injection during cataract surgery in Sweden, India, and the US serves as a model for the successful transitioning of local quality improvement initiatives to organization-wide implementation. Although the delivery of eye care in the 3 countries is distinctly organized with differing governances and technological infrastructure, each contains elements of a learning organization (ie, an organization that has adopted a culture of creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge into practice through system-level and clinician-level change). We describe a retrospective and organizational implementation study of intracameral antibiotic injection in Sweden, through the efforts of the National Cataract Registry; in the US by Kaiser Permanente; and in India by the Aravind Eye Hospital System. Leadership structure, training in problem solving, benchmarking, sharing of technical knowledge, and data and workforce engagement are compared. Each of the 3 organizations share the key elements of effective leadership, which values the exchange of ideas in the workforce, training and resourcing for change, and information management in the form of benchmarking and data sharing. In the case of intracameral antibiotic injection, a new technique was identified to improve quality and safety with a reduction in infections as evidence of the success of the programs. Committing to a culture of collective learning, and leveraging each stakeholder's personal investment, health-care systems may improve care delivery and set new benchmarks in quality and for Electronic Health Records Advances in the modeling and analysis of electronic health records (EHR) have the potential to improve patient risk stratification, leading to better patient outcomes. The modeling of complex temporal relations across the multiple clinical variables inherent in EHR data is largely unexplored. Existing approaches to modeling EHR data often lack the flexibility to handle time-varying correlations across multiple clinical variables, or they are too complex for clinical interpretation. Therefore, we propose a novel nonstationary multivariate Gaussian process model for EHR data to address the aforementioned drawbacks of existing methodologies. Our proposed model is able to capture time-varying scale, correlation and smoothness across multiple clinical variables. We also provide details on two inference approaches: Maximum a posteriori and Hamilton Monte Carlo. Our model is validated on synthetic data and then we demonstrate its effectiveness on EHR data from Kaiser Permanente Division of Research (KPDOR). Finally, we use the KPDOR EHR data to investigate the relationships between a clinical patient risk metric and the latent processes of our proposed model and demonstrate statistically significant correlations between these entities.

Sepsis Subclasses: A Framework for Development and Interpretation Sepsis is defined as a dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening acute organ dysfunction. It afflicts approximately 50 million people worldwide annually and is often deadly, even when evidence-based guidelines are applied promptly. Many randomized trials tested therapies for sepsis over the past 2 decades, but most have not proven beneficial. This may be because sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome, characterized by a vast set of clinical and biologic features. Combinations of these features, however, may identify previously unrecognized groups, or \"subclasses\" with different risks of outcome and response to a given treatment. As efforts to identify sepsis subclasses become more common, many unanswered questions and challenges arise. These include: 1) the semantic underpinning of sepsis subclasses, 2) the conceptual goal of subclasses, 3) considerations about study design, data sources, and statistical methods, 4) the role of emerging data types, and 5) how to determine whether subclasses represent \"truth.\" We discuss these challenges and present a framework for the broader study of sepsis subclasses. This framework is intended to aid in the understanding and interpretation of sepsis subclasses, provide a mechanism for explaining subclasses generated by different methodologic approaches, and guide clinicians in how to consider subclasses in bedside care.

Investigating Bias from Missing Data in an Electronic Health Records-Based Study of Weight Loss After Bariatric Surgery Missing data is common in electronic health records (EHR)-based obesity research. To avoid bias, it is critical to understand mechanisms that underpin missingness. We conducted a survey among bariatric surgery patients in three integrated health systems to (i) investigate predictors of disenrollment and (ii) examine differences in weight between disenrollees and enrollees at 5 years. We identified 2883 patients who had bariatric surgery between 11/2013 and 08/2014. Patients who disenrolled before their 5-year anniversary were invited to participate in a survey to ascertain reasons for disenrollment and current weight. Logistic regression was used to investigate predictors of disenrollment. Five-year percent weight change distributions were estimated using inverse-probability weighting to adjust for (un)availability of EHR weight data at 5 years among enrollees and survey (non-)response among disenrollees. Among 536 disenrolled patients, 104 (19%) completed the survey. Among 2347 patients who maintained enrollment, 384 (16%) had no weight measurement in the EHR near 5 years. Insurance, age, Hispanic ethnicity, and site predicted disenrollment. Disenrollees had slightly greater weight loss than enrollees. We found little evidence of weight loss differences by enrollment status. Collecting information through surveys can be an effective tool to investigate and adjust for missingness in EHR-based studies. Health Literacy Measure Across Race/Ethnicity: Findings from The ECLIPPSE Project Limited health literacy (HL) partially mediates health disparities. Measurement constraints, including lack of validity assessment across racial/ethnic groups and administration challenges, have undermined the field and impeded scaling of HL interventions. We employed computational linguistics to develop an automated and novel HL measure, analyzing >300,000 messages sent by >9,000 diabetes patients via a patient portal to create a Literacy Profiles. We carried out stratified analyses among White/non-Hispanics, Black/non-Hispanics, Hispanics, and Asian/Pacific Islanders to determine if the Literacy Profile has comparable criterion and predictive validities. We discovered that criterion validity was consistently high across all groups (c-statistics 0.82-0.89). We observed consistent relationships across racial/ethnic groups between HL and outcomes, including communication, adherence, hypoglycemia, diabetes control, and ED utilization. While concerns have arisen regarding bias in AI, the automated Literacy Profile appears sufficiently valid across race/ethnicity, enabling HL measurement at a scale that could improve clinical care and population health among diverse populations. 2021 05;32(2 Suppl):347-365. Regionalization of Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment in a Community-Based Population: Implementation and Early Results Regionalization of care for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been described for community-based settings. In 2015, we shifted AML induction from 21 local centers to 3 regional centers. Using time-specific inception cohorts, we assessed whether regionalization was associated with the frequency of use of induction therapy, receipt of bone marrow transplantation, 60-day mortality (treatment toxicity), and 180-day mortality (treatment effectiveness). Information for all adult patients diagnosed with AML from 2013 to 2017 was obtained from the electronic health record. Multivariable methods were used to estimate the adjusted associations of induction, bone marrow transplantation, and death in relation to year of diagnosis before and after regionalization. Of 661 patients diagnosed during 2013 to 2017, 53% were 70 years, 22% were 80 years, and 10% died within the week following diagnosis. Comparing 2017 with 2013, the proportion of patients who received induction therapy increased 2.88 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.55-5.35), and the proportion of non-acute promyelocytic leukemia patients receiving bone marrow transplantation increased 2.00 times (95% CI = 0.89-4.50). Regionalization was associated with lower 180-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.44-0.92), whereas change in 60-day mortality was not statistically significant (HR = 0.67; 95%CI = 0.43-1.04). In this community-based population, many patients were of advanced age yet benefitted from AML induction therapy delivered at a regionally specialized center. These early results suggest the benefit of regionalizing subspecialty leukemia care. 2021 05;25. Visit Content Analysis: Doctor-Patient Communication in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes The primary care visit is an important opportunity to discuss and modify diabetes management. To gain insight into doctor-patient communication during primary care visits among English and Spanish speaking patients with type 2 diabetes and suboptimal glycemic control (HbA1c > 7%). We conducted a quantitative content analysis of audiotaped primary care visits in 2 patient cohorts. In Study 1 (31 English-speaking patients), we examined factors associated with management changes, and in Study 2 (20 Spanish-speaking patients and their Spanish-speaking providers), we examined the association of question asking with HbA1c control. This study was conducted between November 2017 and January 2020 across 8 primary care practices within Kaiser Permanente Northern California. In Study 1, the only factor significantly associated with a diabetes management change was patient identification of diabetes as a priority prior to the visit (91.7% had a management change vs 52.6% of patients who did not identify diabetes as a priority; p = 0.02). In Study 2, patients with poorer glycemic control (HbA1c 10.0) asked significantly fewer questions (3.4 \u00b1 1.8 vs 10.7 \u00b1 6.9 questions per 15 minutes; p = 0.004). Overall, despite receiving primary care from language-concordant providers, Spanish-speaking Study 2 patients asked fewer questions than English-speaking Study 1 patients (4.5 \u00b1 2.9 vs 7.5 \u00b1 3.7 questions per 15 minutes, respectively; p = 0.004). Our results highlight 2 potential strategies (preparing patients for their visits through identifying priorities and learning how to ask more questions during visits) for improving diabetes primary care. Authors: Abdelgadir, Physician Stress During Electronic Health Record Inbox Work: In Situ Measurement With Wearable Sensors Increased work through electronic health record (EHR) messaging is frequently cited as a factor of physician burnout. However, studies to date have relied on anecdotal or self-reported measures, which limit the ability to match EHR use patterns with continuous stress patterns throughout the day. The aim of this study is to collect EHR use and physiologic stress data through unobtrusive means that provide objective and continuous measures, cluster distinct patterns of EHR inbox work, identify physicians' daily physiologic stress patterns, and evaluate the association between EHR inbox work patterns and physician physiologic stress. Physicians were recruited from 5 medical centers. Participants (N=47) were given wrist-worn devices (Garmin Vivosmart 3) with heart rate sensors to wear for 7 days. The devices measured physiological stress throughout the day based on heart rate variability (HRV). Perceived stress was also measured with self-reports through experience sampling and a one-time survey. From the EHR system logs, the time attributed to different activities was quantified. By using a clustering algorithm, distinct inbox work patterns were identified and their associated stress measures were compared. The effects of EHR use on physician stress were examined using a generalized linear mixed effects model. Physicians spent an average of 1.08 hours doing EHR inbox work out of an average total EHR time of 3.5 hours. Patient messages accounted for most of the inbox work time (mean 37%, SD 11%). A total of 3 patterns of inbox work emerged: inbox work mostly outside work hours, inbox work mostly during work hours, and inbox work extending after hours that were mostly contiguous to work hours. Across these 3 groups, physiologic stress patterns showed 3 periods in which stress increased: in the first hour of work, early in the afternoon, and in the evening. Physicians in group 1 had the longest average stress duration during work hours (80 out of 243 min of valid HRV data; P=.02), as measured by physiological sensors. Inbox work duration, the rate of EHR window switching (moving from one screen to another), the proportion of inbox work done outside of work hours, inbox work batching, and the day of the week were each independently associated with daily stress duration (marginal R2=15%). Individual-level random effects were significant and explained most of the variation in stress (conditional R2=98%). This study is among the first to demonstrate associations between electronic inbox work and physiological stress. We identified 3 potentially modifiable factors associated with stress: EHR window switching, inbox work duration, and inbox work outside work hours. Organizations seeking to reduce physician stress may consider system-based changes to reduce EHR window switching or inbox work duration or the incorporation of inbox management time into work Epub 2021-04-28. Physicians' electronic inbox work patterns and factors associated with high inbox work duration Electronic health record systems are increasingly used to send messages to physicians, but research on physicians' inbox use patterns is limited. This study's aims were to (1) quantify the time primary care physicians (PCPs) spend managing inboxes; (2) describe daily patterns of inbox use; (3) investigate which types of messages consume the most time; and (4) identify factors associated with inbox work duration. We analyzed 1 month of electronic inbox data for 1275 PCPs in a large medical group and linked these data with physicians' demographic data. PCPs spent an average of 52 minutes on inbox management on workdays, including 19 minutes (37%) outside work hours. Temporal patterns of electronic inbox use differed from other EHR functions such as charting. Patient-initiated messages (28%) and results (29%) accounted for the most inbox work time. PCPs with higher inbox work duration were more likely to be female (P < .001), have more patient encounters (P < .001), have older patients (P < .001), spend proportionally more time on patient messages (P < .001), and spend more time per message (P < .001). Compared with PCPs with the lowest duration of time on inbox work, PCPs with the highest duration had more message views per workday (200 vs 109; P < .001) and spent more time on the inbox outside work hours (30 minutes vs 9.7 minutes; P < .001). Electronic inbox work by PCPs requires roughly an hour per workday, much of which occurs outside scheduled work hours. Interventions to assist PCPs in handling patient-initiated messages and results may help alleviate workload. Authors: Moeller, J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2021 04 23;28(5):923-930. Influence of patient immigrant status on physician trainee diabetes treatment decisions: a virtual patient experimental study To determine the effect of patient immigrant status on physician trainees' diabetes treatment decisions. Participants were 140 physician trainees ('providers'). Providers viewed videos and vignettes of virtual patients differing in immigrant status (born in Mexico or U.S.; other characteristics held constant). Analyses were completed at the group and individual levels. Providers were less likely to refer foreign-born (vs. U.S.-born) patients to endocrinology. Individual-level results showed an almost even split between treatment ratings for foreign-born vs. U.S.-born patients for three decisions (take no action, add oral hypoglycemic agent, add/switch to insulin), explaining why group-level differences for these ratings did not emerge (i.e., they were cancelled out). Physician trainees are less likely to refer foreign-born patients to endocrinology. Half of individual-level decisions were influenced by patient immigrant status, but group-level analyses mask these differences. Systematic treatment differences based on non-relevant factors could lead to adverse outcomes for immigrants. Behav Med. 2021 Apr 16. Prospective Validation and Comparative Analysis of Coronary Risk Stratification Strategies Among Emergency Department Patients With Chest Pain Background Coronary risk stratification is recommended for emergency department patients with chest pain. Many protocols are designed as \"rule-out\" binary classification strategies, while others use graded-risk stratification. The comparative performance of competing approaches at varying levels of risk tolerance has not been widely reported. Methods and Results This is a prospective cohort study of adult patients with chest pain presenting between January 2018 and December 2019 to 13 medical center emergency departments within an integrated healthcare delivery system. Using an electronic clinical decision support interface, we externally validated and assessed the net benefit (at varying risk thresholds) of several coronary risk scores (History, ECG, Age, Risk Factors, and Troponin [HEART] score, HEART pathway, Emergency Department Assessment of Chest Pain Score Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol), troponin-only strategies (fourth-generation assay), unstructured physician gestalt, and a novel risk algorithm (RISTRA-ACS). The primary outcome was 60-day major adverse cardiac event defined as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, coronary revascularization, or all-cause mortality. There were 13 192 patient encounters included with a 60-day major adverse cardiac event incidence of 3.7%. RISTRA-ACS and HEART pathway had the lowest negative likelihood ratios (0.06, 95% CI, 0.03-0.10 and 0.07, 95% CI, 0.04-0.11, respectively) and the greatest net benefit across a range of low-risk thresholds. RISTRA-ACS demonstrated the highest discrimination for 60-day major adverse cardiac event (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.92, 95% CI, 0.91-0.94, P<0.0001). Conclusions RISTRA-ACS and HEART pathway optimal approaches, while RISTRA-ACS was the best-performing graded-risk approach. RISTRA-ACS offers promise as a versatile single approach to emergency department coronary risk stratification. Reed, Mary E; Kaiser Permanente CREST Network Investigators,; et al.

Acute Kidney Injury After CT in Emergency Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Propensity Score-matched Analysis Acute kidney injury (AKI) after intravenous contrast administration for computed tomography (CT) occurs infrequently, but certain patients may be susceptible. This study evaluated AKI incidence among emergency department (ED) patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing CT exams. This retrospective cohort study in an integrated healthcare system included ED patients previously diagnosed with CKD stages 3-5 (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 milliliters per minute per 1.73 meters squared over at least three months), undergoing CT exams with or without intravenous contrast, from January 1, 2013-December 31, 2017. We excluded patients with CT prior to (30 days) or following (14 days) index CT and missing serum creatinine (sCr) measurements. We applied propensity score matching, and then multivariable regression adjustment for post-CT ED disposition and ED diagnosis, to calculate adjusted risk of AKI. Secondary patient-centered outcomes included 30-day mortality, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) diagnosis, and dialysis initiation. Among 103,573 eligible ED patients undergoing CT, propensity score matching yielded 5,589 pairs. Adjusted risk ratio (ARR) for AKI was higher overall for contrast-enhanced CT (1.60; 95% confidence infrequent: 19/5,589 non-contrast vs 40/5,589 contrast patients with new dialysis initiation at 30 days (adjusted risk 0.3% vs 0.7%; adjusted risk reduction 0.4%; 95% CI, 0.1%-0.7%). In ED patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing CT, intravenous contrast was associated with higher overall adjusted risk of AKI, but patient-centered secondary outcomes were rare. The clinical significance of transient kidney injury after CT is unclear, although patients with advanced chronic kidney disease appear to have elevated Med. 2021 Apr 02;22(3):614-622.

Measurement of Sepsis in a National Cohort Using Three Different Methods to Define Baseline Organ Function Rationale: In 2017, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a new surveillance definition of sepsis, the adult sepsis event (ASE), to better track sepsis epidemiology. The ASE requires evidence of acute organ dysfunction and defines baseline organ function pragmatically as the best in-hospital value. This approach may undercount sepsis if new organ dysfunction does not resolve by discharge.Objectives: To understand how sepsis identification and outcomes differ when using the best laboratory values during hospitalization versus methods that use historical lookbacks to define baseline organ function.Methods: We identified all patients hospitalized at 138 Veterans Affairs hospitals (2013-2018) admitted via the emergency department with two or more systemic inflammatory response criteria, were treated with antibiotics within 48 hours (i.e., had potential infection), and completed 4+ days of antibiotics (i.e., had suspected infection). We considered the following three approaches to defining baseline renal, hematologic, and liver function: the best values during hospitalization (as in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ASE), the best values during hospitalization plus the prior 90 days (3-mo baseline), and the best values during hospitalization plus the prior 180 days (6-mo baseline). We determined how many patients met the criteria for sepsis by each approach, and then compared characteristics and outcomes of sepsis hospitalizations between the three approaches.Results: Among 608,128 hospitalizations with potential infection, 72.1%, 68.5%, and 58.4% had creatinine, platelet, and total bilirubin measured, respectively, in the prior 3 months. A total of 86.0%, 82.6%, and 74.8%, respectively, had these labs in the prior 6 months. Using the hospital baseline, 100,568 hospitalizations met criteria for community-acquired sepsis. By contrast, 111,983 and 117,435 met criteria for sepsis using the 3- and 6-month baselines, for a relative increase of 11% and 17%, respectively. Patient characteristics were similar across the three approaches. In-hospital mortality was 7.2%, 7.0%, and 6.8% for sepsis hospitalizations identified using the hospital, 3-month baseline, and 6-month baseline. The 30-day mortality was 12.5%, 12.7%, and 12.5%, respectively.Conclusions: Among veterans hospitalized with potential infection, the majority had laboratory values in the prior 6 months. Using 3- and 6-month lookbacks to define baseline organ function resulted in an 11% and 17% relative increase, respectively, in the number of sepsis hospitalizations identified. Authors: Wayne, Max 2021 Cohort Study of Reinterventions After Sleeve Gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass To compare the long-term risks of reintervention following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in a large surgical cohort. The use of SG has increased dramatically relative to RYGB for the treatment of obesity. However, long-term risks following SG compared with RYGB have not been adequately defined in a large population-based study. A retrospective longitudinal cohort study of all adult health-plan members undergoing SG or RYGB for obesity in a multistate integrated health care system from January 2005 through September 2015. The risks of nutritional, endoscopic, radiologic, and surgical reintervention as well as the overall risk of any reinterventions at 1, 3, and 5 years were identified using diagnosis and procedure codes from comprehensive electronic medical records. The study included 15,319 patients who underwent SG and 19,954 patients who underwent RYGB with a follow-up of 79.2%. The overall risk of any reintervention at 5 years was 21.3% for SG and 28.3% for RYGB (P < 0.0001). After adjustment, SG was associated with fewer reinterventions through 5 years than RYGB (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.84). When comparing subcategories, SG also had a lower risk of nutritional, endoscopic, radiologic, and surgical reinterventions when examined versus RYGB. The findings for risks of reinterventions were consistent across clinical subgroups. SG has significantly lower risk of reintervention in all categories studied when compared with RYGB at 5-year follow-up. The long-term safety profile of LSG compared with RYGB should be an essential part of the discussion in patient-centered decision making when choosing between bariatric procedure options.

Smoking cessation treatment for individuals with comorbid diabetes and serious mental illness in an integrated health care delivery system Smoking is a significant modifiable risk factor for mortality for persons with serious mental illness (SMI), who have a life expectancy 15-20 years shorter than the general population. Individuals with SMI and comorbid diabetes who are smokers face an even higher risk of cardiovascular complications and early death. Yet despite high rates of smoking among people with SMI, tobacco cessation interventions have not been broadly offered to this population. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health records from 2014 in a large integrated care delivery system to examine whether use of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy among smokers with type 2 diabetes varies by serious mental illness (SMI) diagnosis. We analyzed smoking cessation medication prescription fills among adult smokers with diabetes, comparing those with SMI (N = 634) and without SMI (N = 18,021). Risk ratios were adjusted for age, gender, race, urban area type, and medical facility. Of the SMI group, 19.09% filled at least one smoking cessation prescription compared to 9.73% of the non-SMI group (adjusted risk ratio 1.80 [95% CI 1.52-2.13]; p < .001). For the SMI group, primary care providers wrote 80.24% of prescriptions, while psychiatrists wrote 8.81% of prescriptions. These findings offer an example of a delivery system with higher uptake of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy among people with SMI than without SMI, and highlight the opportunity to provide more smoking cessation interventions in mental health care settings. The Presentation, Pace, and Profile of Infection and Sepsis Patients Hospitalized Through the Emergency Department: An Exploratory Analysis To characterize the signs and symptoms of sepsis, compare them with those from simple infection and other emergent conditions and evaluate their association with hospital outcomes. A multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 408,377 patients hospitalized through the emergency department from 2012 to 2017 with sepsis, suspected infection, heart failure, or stroke. Infected patients were identified based on Sepsis-3 criteria, whereas noninfected patients were identified through diagnosis codes. Signs and symptoms were identified within physician clinical documentation in the first 24 hours of hospitalization using natural language processing. The time of sign and symptom onset prior to presentation was quantified, and sign and symptom prevalence was assessed. Using multivariable logistic regression, the association of each sign and symptom with four outcomes was evaluated: sepsis versus suspected infection diagnosis, hospital mortality, ICU admission, and time of first antibiotics (> 3 vs 3 hr from presentation). A total of 10,825 signs and symptoms were identified in 6,148,348 clinical documentation fragments. The most common symptoms overall were as follows: dyspnea (35.2%), weakness (27.2%), fever (13.9%), and chest pain (12.1%). Compared with predominant signs and symptoms in heart failure and stroke, those present in infection were heterogeneous. Signs and symptoms indicative of neurologic dysfunction, significant respiratory conditions, and hypotension were strongly associated with sepsis diagnosis, hospital mortality, and intensive care. Fever, present in only a minority of patients, was associated with improved mortality (odds ratio, 0.67, 95% CI, 0.64-0.70; p < 0.001). For common symptoms, the peak time of symptom onset before sepsis was 2 days, except for altered mental status, which peaked at 1 day prior to presentation. The clinical presentation of sepsis was heterogeneous and occurred with rapid onset prior to hospital presentation. These findings have important implications for improving public education, clinical treatment, and quality measures of sepsis care. Authors: Liu, Vincent X; Bhimarao, Meghana; 2021-02-24. Patient e-Visit Use and Outcomes for Common Symptoms in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System Authors: Bhargava, 2021-03-01. Characteristics and Outcomes of Clinic Visits Immediately Preceding Sepsis Hospitalization Existing sepsis quality improvement initiatives focus on recognition and treatment of sepsis upon hospital admission. Yet many patients are evaluated in the clinic within 1 day of sepsis hospitalization. To determine the circumstances of clinic visits that precede sepsis hospitalization, including illness severity, whether patients are referred to the hospital, and time lapse and change in illness severity between clinic and hospital evaluation. In a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary academic medical center, data from electronic medical records were collected for all adult patients evaluated in an outpatient clinic within 1 day of sepsis hospitalization in 2017. Of 1450 patients hospitalized with sepsis, 118 had an established outpatient provider and a clinic visit within 1 day of admission and thus were included. During the clinic visit, 47 patients (39.8%) had a quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score 1, and 59 (50.0%) had vital sign abnormalities. Most (74, 62.7%) were sent directly to the emergency department or hospital. Upon emergency department/hospital presentation, 62 patients (52.5%) had a worsening qSOFA score and/ or vital signs and 27 (22.9%) had worsening of multiple parameters. Median time lapse from clinic to emergency department/hospital evaluation was 3.2 hours. One in 10 patients hospitalized for sepsis had been evaluated in a clinic within 1 day of admission. At that clinic visit, most patients had an elevated qSOFA score or abnormal vital signs and a majority were sent directly to the emergency department/hospital. Half experienced clinical deterioration between the clinic visit and arrival in the emergency department/hospital.

SARS-CoV-2 Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Cancer in a Large Integrated Health Care System in Northern California The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to affect many lives globally. Patients with cancer undergoing potentially immunosuppressive therapies appear to be at particular risk for the disease and its complications. Here, we describe the experience of patients with cancer within Kaiser Permanente, a large, integrated health system in Northern California. Between February 25, 2020, and June 8, 2020, 4,627 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 33 had active cancer treatment within 180 days and 214 had a history of cancer. Patients with active cancer treatment had a statistically higher risk of requiring noninvasive ventilation (odds ratio [OR], 2.57; confidence interval [CI], 1.10-6.01), and there was a nonsignificant trend toward higher risk of death (OR, 2.78; CI, 0.92-8.43). Those with a history of cancer had comparable outcomes to those without cancer. These data demonstrate an increased risk of complications from COVID-19 for patients with active cancer treatment. Authors: Anantharaman, Archana; Program: How far have we come? The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) was developed and implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to curb the rate of 30-day hospital readmissions for certain common, high-impact conditions. In October 2014, COPD became a target condition for which hospitals were penalized for excess readmissions. The appropriateness, utility, and potential unintended consequences of the metric have been a topic of debate since it was first enacted. Nevertheless, there is evidence that hospital policies broadly implemented in response to the HRRP may have been responsible for reducing the rate of readmissions following COPD hospitalizations even before it was added as a target condition. Since the addition of the COPD condition to the HRRP, several predictive models have been developed to predict COPD survival and readmissions, with the intention of identifying modifiable risk factors. A number of interventions have also been studied, with mixed results. Bundled care interventions using the electronic health record and patient education interventions for inhaler education have been shown to reduce readmissions, whereas pulmonary rehabilitation, follow-up visits, and self-management programs have not been consistently shown to do the same. Through this program, COPD has become recognized as a public health priority. However, 5 years after COPD became a target condition for HRRP, there continues to be no single intervention that reliably prevents readmissions in this patient population. Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects of the policy, the role of competing risks in measuring quality, the optimal postdischarge care for patients with COPD, and the integrated use of predictive modeling and advanced technologies to prevent COPD readmissions.

Predictors of Acute Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter Hospitalization across 7 U.S. Emergency Departments: A Prospective Study International rates of hospitalization for atrial fibrillation and flutter (AFF) from the emergency department (ED) vary widely without clear evidence to guide the identification of high-risk patients requiring inpatient management. We sought to determine (1) variation in hospital admission and (2) modifiable factors associated with hospitalization of AFF patients within a U.S. integrated health system. This multicenter prospective observational study of health plan members with symptomatic AFF was conducted using convenience sampling in 7 urban community EDs from 05/2011 to 08/2012. Prospective data collection included presenting symptoms, characteristics of atrial dysrhythmia, ED physician impression of hemodynamic instability, comorbid diagnoses, ED management, and ED discharge rhythm. All centers had full-time on-call cardiology consultation available. Additional variables were extracted from the electronic health record. We identified factors associated with hospitalization and included predictors in a multivariate Poisson Generalized Estimating Equations regression model to estimate adjusted relative risks while accounting for clustering by physician. Among 1,942 eligible AFF patients, 1,074 (55.3%) were discharged home and 868 (44.7%) were hospitalized. Hospitalization rates ranged from 37.4% to 60.4% across medical centers. After adjustment, modifiable factors associated with increased hospital admission from the ED included non-sinus rhythm at ED discharge, no attempted cardioversion, and heart rate reduction. Within an integrated health system, we found significant variation in AFF hospitalization rates and identified several modifiable factors associated with hospital admission. Standardizing treatment goals that specifically address best practices for ED rate reduction and rhythm control may reduce hospitalizations.

Implementation of a Multidisciplinary Expert Testicular Cancer Tumor Board Across a Large Integrated Healthcare Delivery System Via Early Case Ascertainment In 2016, Kaiser Permanente Northern California began regionalizing testicular cancer care using population-based tumor board review. This mixed methods evaluation describes implementation outcomes and learnings. We conducted in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, administered surveys to local oncologists and urologists, and used clinical data to evaluate changes in care delivery during 2015-2018. An average of 135 patients with testicular cancer were diagnosed each year. Interviews with 16 key stakeholders provided several insights. Implementation resulted in high levels of satisfaction, was dependent on leadership and staff at various levels, and required technology and consulting solutions aligned to user agreements and clinical workflows. Of 123 local oncologists and urologists who completed surveys, 97% understood why care was regionalized and 89% agreed that tumor board review improved treatment decisions. Among 177 patients with stage I seminoma, the percentage appropriately observed rather than treated with adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy increased from 48% (95% CI, 35 to 62) in 2015 to 87% (75 to 99) in 2018. Review altered care based on pathology and radiology re-review in 14.5 % of cases. Regionalization was feasible effective.

Using a retrospective cohort design, we identified all emergency department (ED) visits for acute heart failure between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018, among adult health plan members of a large system with 21 EDs. The primary outcome was any 30-day serious adverse event, including death, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, balloon-pump insertion, intubation, new dialysis, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization. Starting with the 13 variables from the STRATIFY rule (base model), we tested whether predictive accuracy in a different population could be enhanced with additional electronic health record-based variables or machine-learning approaches (compared with logistic regression). We calculated our derived model area under the curve (AUC), calculated test characteristics, and assessed admission rates across risk categories. Among 26,189 total ED encounters, mean patient age was 74 years, 51.7% were women, and 60.7% were white. The overall 30-day serious adverse event rate was 18.8%. The base model had an AUC of 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.77). Incorporating additional variables led to improved accuracy with logistic regression (AUC 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 0.85; 95% 0.86). We found that 11.1%, 25.7%, and 48.9% of the study population had predicted serious adverse event risk of less than or equal to 3%, less than or equal to 5%, and less than or equal to 10%, respectively, and 28% of those with less than or equal to 3% risk were admitted. Use of a machine-learning model with additional variables improved 30-day risk prediction compared with conventional approaches. Authors: 2021 02;77(2):237-248. Epub 2020-12-24. Employing computational linguistics techniques to identify limited patient health literacy: Findings from the ECLIPPSE study To develop novel, scalable, and valid literacy profiles for identifying limited health literacy patients by harnessing natural language processing. With respect to the linguistic content, we analyzed 283 216 secure messages sent by 6941 diabetes patients to physicians within an integrated system's electronic portal. Sociodemographic, clinical, and utilization data were obtained via questionnaire and electronic health records. Retrospective study used natural language processing and machine learning to generate five unique \"Literacy Profiles\" by employing various sets of linguistic indices: Flesch-Kincaid (LP_FK); basic indices of writing complexity, including lexical diversity (LP_LD) and writing quality (LP_WQ); and advanced indices related to syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication, and diversity, modeled from self-reported (LP_SR), and expert-rated (LP_Exp) health literacy. We first determined the performance of each literacy profile relative to self-reported and expert-rated health literacy to discriminate between high and low health literacy and then assessed Literacy Profiles' relationships with known correlates of health literacy, such as patient sociodemographics and a range of health-related outcomes, including ratings of physician communication, medication adherence, diabetes control, comorbidities, and utilization. LP_SR and LP_Exp performed best in discriminating between high and low self-reported (C-statistics: 0.86 and 0.58, respectively) and expert-rated health literacy (C-statistics: 0.71 and 0.87, respectively) and were significantly associated with educational attainment, race/ethnicity, Consumer Assessment of Provider and Systems (CAHPS) scores, adherence, glycemia, comorbidities, and emergency department visits. Since health literacy is a potentially remediable explanatory factor in health care disparities, the development of automated health literacy indicators represents a significant accomplishment with broad clinical and population health applications. Health systems could apply literacy profiles to efficiently determine whether quality of care and outcomes vary by patient health literacy; identify at-risk populations for targeting tailored health communications and self-management support interventions; and inform clinicians to promote 02;56(1):132-144.

BACKGROUND: Many adults have risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Screening all adults with risk factors for NAFLD using imaging is not feasible. OBJECTIVE: To develop a practical scoring tool for predicting NAFLD using participant demographics, medical history, anthropometrics, and lab values. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. PARTICIPANTS: Data came from 6194 white, African American, Hispanic, and Chinese American participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort, ages 45-85 years. MAIN MEASURES: NAFLD was identified by liver computed (= 40 Hounsfield units indicating > 30% hepatic steatosis) and data on 14 predictors was assessed for predicting NAFLD. Random forest variable importance was used to identify the minimum subset of variables required to achieve the highest predictive power. This subset was used to derive (n = 4132) and validate (n = 2063) a logistic regression-based score (NAFLD-MESA Index). A second NAFLD-Clinical Index excluding laboratory predictors was also developed. KEY RESULTS: NAFLD prevalence was 6.2%. The model included eight predictors: age, sex, race/ethnicity, type 2 diabetes, smoking history, body mass index, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and triglycerides (TG). The NAFLD-Clinical Index model excluded GGT and TG. In the NAFLD-MESA model, the derivation set achieved an AUCNAFLD-MESA = 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to = (0.77 AUCClinical = 0.78 [0.75 to 0.81] in the derivation set AUCClinical 0.76 [0.72 to 0.80] in the validation set (pBonferroni-adjusted < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The two models are simple but highly predictive tools that can aid clinicians to identify individuals at high NAFLD risk who could benefit from imaging.

Evaluation of Attention Switching and Duration of Electronic Inbox Work Among Primary Care Physicians Primary care physicians (PCPs) report multitasking during workdays while processing electronic inbox messages, but scant systematic information exists on attention switching and its correlates in the health care setting. To describe PCPs' frequency of attention switching associated with electronic inbox work, identify potentially modifiable factors associated with attention switching and inbox work duration, and compare the relative association of attention switching and other factors with inbox work duration. This cross-sectional study of the work of 1275 PCPs in an integrated group serving 4.5 million patients used electronic health record (EHR) access logs from March 1 to 31, 2018, to evaluate PCPs' frequency of attention switching. Statistical analysis was performed from October 15, 2018, to August 28, 2020. Attention switching was defined as switching between the electronic inbox, other EHR work, and non-EHR periods. Inbox work duration included minutes spent on electronic inbox message views and related EHR tasks. Multivariable models controlled for the exposures. The 1275 PCPs studied (721 women [56.5%]; mean [SD] age, 45.9 [8.5] years) had a mean (SD) of 9.0 (7.6) years of experience with the medical group and received a mean (SD) of 332.6 (148.3) (interquartile range, 252-418) new inbox messages weekly. On workdays, PCPs made a mean (SD) of 79.4 (21.8) attention switches associated with inbox work and did a mean (SD) 64.2 (18.7) minutes of inbox work over the course of 24 hours on workdays. In the model for attention switching, each additional patient secure message beyond the reference value was associated with 0.289 (95% CI, 0.217-0.362) additional switches, each additional results message was associated with 0.203 (95% CI, 0.127-0.278) additional switches, each additional request message was associated with 0.190 (95% CI, 0.124-0.257) additional switches, and each additional administrative message was associated with 0.262 (95% CI, 0.166-0.358) additional switches. Having a panel (a list of patients assigned to a primary care team) with more elderly patients (0.144 switches per percentage increase [95% CI, 0.009-0.278]) and higher inbox work duration (0.468 switches per additional minute of inbox work [95% CI, 0.411-0.524]) were also associated with higher attention switching involving the inbox. In the model for inbox work duration, each additional patient secure message beyond the reference value was associated with 0.151 (95% CI, 0.085-0.217) additional minutes, each additional results message was associated with 0.338 (95% CI, 0.272-0.404) additional minutes, each additional request message was associated with 0.101 (95% CI, 0.041-0.161) additional minutes, and each additional administrative message was associated with 0.179 (95% CI, 0.093-0.265) additional minutes. A higher percentage of the panel's patients initiating messages (0.386 minutes per percentage increase [95% CI, 0.026-0.745]) and attention switches (0.373 minutes per switch [95% CI, 0.328-0.419]) were also associated with higher inbox work duration. In addition, working at a medical center where all PCPs had high inbox work duration was independently associated with high or low inbox work duration. This study suggests that PCPs make frequent attention switches during workdays while processing electronic inbox messages. Message quantity was associated with both attention switching and inbox work duration. Physician and patient panel characteristics had less association with attention switching and inbox work duration. Assisting PCPs with message quantity might help modulate both attention switching and inbox work duration. Authors: Lieu, Tracy (but not acute) WIN 55,212-2 treatment increased resistance to change in two reward downshift tasks. Assessing the role of cannabinoid (CB) receptors in behavior is relevant given the trend toward the legalization of medicinal and recreational marijuana. The present research aims at bridging a gap in our understanding of CB-receptor function in animal models of frustrative nonreward. These experiments were designed to (1) determine the effects of chronic administration of the nonselective CB1-receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) on reward downshift in rats and (2) determine whether the effects of chronic WIN were reducible to acute effects. In Experiment 1, chronic WIN (7 daily injections, 10 mg/kg, ip) accelerated the recovery of consummatory behavior after a 32-to-4% sucrose downshift relative to vehicle controls. In addition, chronic WIN eliminated the preference for an unshifted lever when the other lever was subject to a 12-to-2 pellet downshift in free-choice trials, but only in animals with previous experience with a sucrose downshift. In Experiment 2, acute WIN (1 mg/kg, ip) reduced consummatory behavior, but did not affect recovery from a 32-to-4% sucrose downshift. The antagonist SR 141716A (3 mg/kg, ip) also failed to interfere with recovery after the sucrose downshift. In Experiment 3, acute WIN administration (1 mg/kg, ip) did not affect free-choice behavior after a pellet downshift, although it reduced lever pressing and increased magazine entries relative to vehicle controls. The effects of chronic WIN on frustrative nonreward were not reducible to acute effects of the drug. Chronic WIN treatment in rats, like chronic marijuana use in humans, seems to increase resistance to the effects of frustrative nonreward. an Obstetric Comorbidity Risk Score for Clinical Use Background: A comorbidity summary score may support early and systematic identification of women at high risk for adverse obstetric outcomes. The objective of this study was to conduct the initial development and validation of an obstetrics comorbidity risk score for automated implementation in the electronic health record (EHR) for clinical use. Methods: The score was developed and validated using EHR data for a retrospective cohort of pregnancies with delivery between 2010 and 2018 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated health care system. The outcome used for model development consisted of adverse obstetric events from delivery hospitalization (e.g., eclampsia, hemorrhage, death). Candidate predictors included maternal age, parity, multiple gestation, and any maternal diagnoses assigned in health care encounters in the 12 months before admission for delivery. We used penalized regression for variable selection, logistic regression to fit the model, and internal validation for model evaluation. We also evaluated prenatal model performance at 18 weeks of pregnancy. Results: The development cohort (n = 227,405 pregnancies) had an outcome rate of 3.8% and the validation cohort (n = 41,683) had an outcome rate of 2.9%. Of 276 candidate predictors, 37 were included in the final model. The final model had a validation c-statistic of 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.73). When evaluated at 18 weeks of pregnancy, discrimination was modestly diminished (c-statistic 0.68 [95% CI 0.67-0.70]). Conclusions: The obstetric comorbidity score demonstrated good discrimination for adverse obstetric outcomes. After additional appropriate validation, the score can be automated in the EHR to support early identification of high-risk women and assist efforts to ensure risk-appropriate maternal care.

Health Risks and Chronic Health Conditions among Arab American and White Adults in Northern California To characterize the prevalence of chronic cardiovascular conditions and risk factors among Arab American adults stratified by sex and compare these with non-Hispanic Whites. Cross-sectional study using electronic health record data from visits between January 2015 and December 2016. Age-adjusted prevalence estimates were calculated for men and women and compared using generalized linear models. Kaiser Permanente health plan in Northern California. Non-Hispanic White (N=969,566) and Arab American (N=18,072) adult members. Sex-stratified prevalence and prevalence ratios of diabetes, pre-diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed by December 2016 and of obesity, ever smoking, and current smoking status. Arab American men had a significantly higher prevalence of ever smoking (41.8 vs 40.8%), diabetes (17.3 vs 12.5%), and hyperlipidemia (40.8 vs 34.7%) than White men, but a significantly lower prevalence of obesity (34.4 vs 37.8%) and hypertension (30.5 vs 33.3%). Arab American women had a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes (11.1 vs 8.7%) and hyperlipidemia (31.5 vs 28.3%) than White women but significantly lower prevalence of obesity (31.0 vs 34.2%), ever smoking (24.8 vs 34.5%), and hypertension (25.8 vs 28.4%).

Challenges and solutions to employing natural language processing and machine learning to measure patients' health literacy and physician writing complexity: The ECLIPPSE study In the National Library of Medicine funded ECLIPPSE Project (Employing Computational Linguistics to Improve Patient-Provider Secure Emails exchange), we attempted to create novel, valid, and scalable measures of both patients' health literacy (HL) and physicians' linguistic complexity by employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning (ML). We applied these techniques to > 400,000 patients' and physicians' secure messages (SMs) exchanged via an electronic patient portal, developing and validating an automated patient literacy profile (LP) and physician complexity profile (CP). Herein, we describe the challenges faced and the solutions implemented during this innovative endeavor. To describe challenges and solutions, we used two data sources: study documents and interviews with study investigators. Over the five years of the project, the team tracked their research process using a combination of Google Docs tools and an online team organization, tracking, and management tool (Asana). In year 5, the team convened a number of times to discuss, categorize, and code primary challenges and solutions. We identified 23 challenges and associated approaches that emerged from three overarching process domains: (1) Data Mining related to the SM corpus; (2) Analyses using NLP indices on the SM corpus; and (3) Interdisciplinary Collaboration. With respect to Data Mining, problems included cleaning SMs to enable analyses, removing hidden caregiver proxies (e.g., other family members) and Spanish language SMs, and culling SMs to ensure that only patients' primary care physicians were included. With respect to Analyses, critical decisions needed to be made as to which computational linguistic indices and ML approaches should be selected; how to enable the NLP-based linguistic indices tools to run smoothly and to extract meaningful data from a large corpus of medical text; and how to best assess content and predictive validities of both the LP and the CP. With respect to the Interdisciplinary Collaboration, because the research required engagement between clinicians, health services researchers, biomedical informaticians, linguists, and cognitive scientists, continual effort was needed to identify and reconcile differences in scientific terminologies and resolve confusion; arrive at common understanding of tasks that needed to be completed and priorities therein; reach compromises regarding what represents \"meaningful findings\" in health services vs. cognitive science research; and address constraints regarding potential transportability of the final LP and CP to different health care settings. Our study represents a process evaluation of an innovative research initiative to harness \"big linguistic data\" to estimate patient HL and physician linguistic complexity. Any of the challenges we identified, if left unaddressed, would have either rendered impossible the effort to generate LPs and CPs, or invalidated analytic results related to the LPs and CPs. Investigators undertaking similar research in HL or using computational linguistic methods to assess patient-clinician exchange will face similar challenges and may find our solutions helpful when designing and executing their health communications research.

A Randomized Encouragement Trial to Increase Mail Order Pharmacy Use and Medication Adherence in Patients with Diabetes Mail order pharmacy (MOP) use has been linked to improved medication adherence and health outcomes among patients with diabetes. However, no large-scale intervention studies have assessed the effect of encouraging MOP use on medication adherence. To assess an intervention to encourage MOP services to increase its use and medication adherence. Randomized encouragement trial. 63,012 diabetes patients from three health care systems: Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), Kaiser Permanente Hawaii (KPHI), and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care (HPHC) who were poorly adherent to at least one class of cardiometabolic medications and had not used MOP in the prior 12 months. Patients were randomized to receive either usual care (control arm) or outreach encouraging MOP use consisting of a mailed letter, secure email message, and automated telephone call outlining the potential benefits of MOP use (intervention arm). HPHC intervention patients received the letter only. We compared the percentages of patients that began using MOP and that became adherent to cardiometabolic medication classes during a 12-month follow-up period. We also conducted a race/ethnicity-stratified analysis. During follow-up, 10.6% of intervention patients began using MOP vs. 9.3% of controls (p < 0.01); the percent of cardiometabolic medication delivered via mail was 42.1% vs. 39.8% (p < 0.01). Metformin adherence improved in the intervention arm relative to control at the two KP sites (52% vs. 49%, p < 0.01). Stratified analyses suggested a significant positive effect of the intervention in White (RR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.22) and Asian (RR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.45) patients. This pragmatic trial showed that simple outreach to encourage MOP modestly increased its use and improved adherence measured by refills to a key class of diabetes medications in some settings. Given its minimal cost, clinicians and health systems should consider outreach interventions to actively promote MOP use among diabetes patients. Med. 2021 01;36(1):154-161. Epub 2020-10-01. Outpatient Mastectomy: Factors Influencing Patient Selection and Predictors of Return to Care After implementation of the Surgical Home Recovery (SHR) initiative for mastectomy within a large, integrated health delivery system, most patients are discharged on the day of the procedure. We sought to identify predictors of SHR and unplanned return to care (RTC). Mastectomy cases with and without reconstruction from October 2017 to August 2019 were analyzed. Patient characteristics, operative variables, and multimodal pain management were compared between admitted patients and SHR patients using logistic regression. We identified predictors of RTC in SHR patients, defined as 7-day readmission, or emergency department visit. Of 2,648 mastectomies, 1,689 (64%) were outpatient procedures and the mean age of patients was 58.5 years. Predictors of SHR included 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.02), and operation performed by a high-volume breast surgeon (OR 2.12; 95% CI, 1.42 to 3.18). Bilateral mastectomies (OR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91), immediate reconstruction (OR 0.52; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.70), and American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3 to 4 (OR 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.87) decreased the odds of SHR. Of SHR patients, 111 of 1,689 patients (7%) experienced RTC. Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3 to 4 (OR 2.01; 95% CI, 1.29 to 3.14) and African American race (OR 2.30; 95% CI, 1.38 to 4.91) were more likely to RTC; receiving IV acetaminophen (OR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.88) and filling opiate prescription (OR 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.77) decreased the odds of RTC. Surgeon volume and multimodal pain medication increased the odds of SHR. Within the SHR group, American Society of Anesthesiologists Class 3 to 4 and African American patients increased the likelihood of RTC. This study helps optimize patient selection and perioperative practice for successful SHR.

Use of Latent Class Analysis and k-Means Clustering to Identify Complex Patient Profiles Medically complex patients are a heterogeneous group that contribute to a substantial proportion of health care costs. Coordinated efforts to improve care and reduce costs for this patient population have had limited success to date. To define distinct patient clinical profiles among the most medically complex patients through clinical interpretation of analytically derived patient clusters. This cohort study analyzed the most medically complex patients within Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care delivery system, based on comorbidity score, prior emergency department admissions, and predicted likelihood of hospitalization, from July 18, 2018, to July 15, 2019. From a starting point of over 5000 clinical variables, we used both clinical judgment and analytic methods to reduce to the 97 most informative covariates. Patients were then grouped using 2 methods (latent class analysis, generalized low-rank models, with k-means clustering). Results were interpreted by a panel of clinical stakeholders to define clinically meaningful patient profiles. Complex patient profiles, 1-year health care utilization, and mortality outcomes by profile. The analysis included 104 869 individuals representing 3.3% of the adult population (mean 52.4% women; class analysis resulted in a 7-class solution. Stakeholders defined the following complex patient profiles (prevalence): high acuity (9.4%), older patients with cardiovascular complications (15.9%), frail elderly (12.5%), pain management (12.3%), psychiatric illness (12.0%), cancer treatment (7.6%), and less engaged (27%). Patients in these groups had significantly different 1-year mortality rates (ranging from 3.0% for psychiatric illness profile to 23.4% for frail elderly profile; risk ratio, 7.9 [95% CI, 7.1-8.8], P < .001). Repeating the analysis using k-means clustering resulted in qualitatively similar groupings. Each clinical profile suggested a distinct collaborative care strategy to optimize management. The findings suggest that highly medically complex patient populations may be categorized into distinct patient profiles that are amenable to varying strategies for resource allocation and coordinated care interventions.

Predicting preventable hospital readmissions with causal machine learning To assess both the feasibility and potential impact of predicting preventable hospital readmissions using causal machine learning applied to data from the implementation of a readmissions prevention intervention (the Transitions Program). Electronic health records maintained by Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Retrospective causal forest analysis of postdischarge outcomes among KPNC inpatients. Using data from both before and after implementation, we apply causal forests to estimate individual-level treatment effects of the Transitions Program intervention on 30-day readmission. These estimates are used to characterize treatment effect heterogeneity and to assess the notional impacts of alternative targeting strategies in terms of the number of readmissions prevented. 1 539 285 index hospitalizations meeting the inclusion criteria and occurring between June 2010 and December 2018 at 21 KPNC hospitals. There appears to be substantial heterogeneity in patients' responses to the intervention (omnibus test for heterogeneity p = 2.23 \u00d7 10-7 ), particularly across levels of predicted risk. Notably, predicted treatment effects become more positive as predicted risk increases; patients at somewhat lower risk appear to have the largest predicted effects. Moreover, these estimates appear to be well calibrated, yielding the same estimate of annual readmissions prevented in the actual treatment subgroup (1246, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1110-1381) as did a formal evaluation of the Transitions Program (1210, 95% CI 990-1430). Estimates of the impacts of alternative targeting strategies suggest that as many as 4458 (95% CI 3925-4990) readmissions could be prevented annually, while decreasing the number needed to treat from 33 to 23, by targeting patients with the largest predicted effects rather than those at highest risk. Causal machine learning can be used to identify preventable hospital readmissions, if the requisite interventional data are available. Moreover, our results suggest a mismatch between risk and treatment effects.

To optimize sensitivity, many clinicians employ a modified HEART score by repeating troponin measurements and excluding patients with abnormal troponin values or ischemic electrocardiograms (ECGs). The residual MACE risk among patients with otherwise non-low (4) modified HEART scores is thus likely much lower than with non-low original HEART scores. To explore residual 60-day MACE risks among patients with non-low modified HEART scores. Secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort of ED patients presenting with chest pain to an integrated healthcare system between 2013 and 2015. Patients with serial troponin measurements within 6 h of ED arrival were considered for inclusion. Exclusions included an ischemic ECG, troponin values above the 99th percentile or a lack of continuous health plan coverage through the 60-day follow-up period. MACE was defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock or death. There were 22,976 study eligible patients encounters, 13,521 (59%) of which had non-low (4) modified HEART scores. The observed 60-day MACE risk among non-low HEART score patients was 2.0% (95% CI 1.8-2.3). When including all coronary revascularizations (MACE-R), risk was 4.4% (95% CI 4.1-4.4). Risk of near-term MACE among patients with non-low modified HEART scores (excluding those with abnormal troponin or ischemic ECGs) appears to be much lower than in the original HEART score validation studies.

Automated Identification of Adults at Risk for In-Hospital Clinical Deterioration Hospitalized adults whose condition deteriorates while they are in wards (outside the intensive care unit [ICU]) have considerable morbidity and mortality. Early identification of patients at risk for clinical deterioration has relied on manually calculated scores. Outcomes after an automated detection of impending clinical deterioration have not been widely reported. On the basis of a validated model that uses information from electronic medical records to identify hospitalized patients at high risk for clinical deterioration (which permits automated, real-time risk-score calculation), we developed an intervention program involving remote monitoring by nurses who reviewed records of patients who had been identified as being at high risk; results of this monitoring were then communicated to rapid-response teams at hospitals. We compared outcomes (including the primary outcome, mortality within 30 days after an alert) among hospitalized patients (excluding those in the ICU) whose condition reached the alert threshold at hospitals where the system was operational (intervention sites, where alerts led to a clinical response) with outcomes among patients at hospitals where the system had not yet been deployed (comparison sites, where a patient's condition would have triggered a clinical response after an alert had the system been operational). Multivariate analyses adjusted for demographic characteristics, severity of illness, and burden of coexisting conditions. The program was deployed in a staggered fashion at 19 hospitals between August 1, 2016, and February 28, 2019. We identified 548,838 non-ICU hospitalizations involving 326,816 patients. A total of 43,949 hospitalizations (involving 35,669 patients) involved a patient whose condition reached the alert threshold; 15,487 hospitalizations were included in the intervention cohort, and 28,462 hospitalizations in the comparison cohort. Mortality within 30 days after an alert was lower in the intervention cohort than in the comparison cohort (adjusted relative risk, 0.84, 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.90; P<0.001). The use of an automated predictive model to identify high-risk patients for whom interventions by rapid-response teams could be implemented was associated with decreased mortality.

Expanding Post-discharge Readmission Metrics in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common and costly reason for hospitalization and rehospitalization. The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program penalizes hospitals for excess, non-elective, all-cause 30-day, inpatient rehospitalizations for COPD. We sought to determine how broadening the outcome definition would alter the numbers of patients being counted if observation stays and patients who died in the post-discharge period were included. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized for COPD between 6/1/2010 and 12/31/2017 from 21 hospitals in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We classified encounters into three outcomes groups based on a 30-day post-discharge observation period: Group 1) non-elective, all-cause, inpatient rehospitalizations, which is the current metric, Group 2) composite outcome of Group 1 or all-cause mortality, and Group 3) composite outcome of Group 1 or non-elective, all-cause, observation rehospitalization. We used the Box-Cox method to find the transformation of the cumulative curves that resulted in the smallest mean standard error. We used the slope of the transformed curve against days to test for significant differences between pairs of cumulative density curves. Of 1,384,025 hospitalizations, 11,304 encounters from 8,097 patients met criteria to be index hospitalizations. The event rate for non-elective, all-cause, inpatient rehospitalizations was 17.1% (95% all-cause mortality was 4.7% (95% CI 3.1-7.7). The event non-elective observation rehospitalizations was 3.9% (95% CI 1.7-7.0). The slope and standard error for Group 1 were 1.17 and 0.01, respectively, while the slope and standard error for Group 2 were 1.62 and 0.01, respectively (P=0.02 comparing Groups 1 and 2). The slope and standard error for Group 3 were 1.45 and 0.01, respectively (P=0.02 comparing Groups 1 and 3). We show that adding outcomes such as mortality and observation rehospitalizations would change the counts of patients contributing to the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program penalty for COPD if the outcome were broadened. Including mortality or observation stays in the quality incentive program might incentivize hospitals and providers to prevent these events in addition to inpatient rehospitalizations.

Association of a Novel Index of Hospital Capacity Strain with Admission to Intensive Care Units Rationale: Prior approaches to measuring healthcare capacity strain have been constrained by using individual care units, limited metrics of strain, or general, rather than disease-specific, populations.Objectives: We sought to develop a novel composite strain index and measure its association with intensive care unit (ICU) admission decisions and hospital outcomes.Methods: Using more than 9.2 million acute care encounters from 27 Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Penn Medicine hospitals from 2013 to 2018, we deployed multivariable ridge logistic regression to develop a composite strain index based on hourly measurements of 22 capacity-strain metrics across emergency departments, wards, step-down units, and ICUs. We measured the association of this strain index with ICU admission and clinical outcomes using multivariable logistic and quantile regression.Results: Among high-acuity patients with sepsis (n = 90,150) and acute respiratory failure (ARF; n = 45,339) not requiring mechanical ventilation or vasopressors, strain at the time of emergency department disposition decision was inversely associated with the probability of ICU admission (sepsis: adjusted probability ranging from 29.0% [95% confidence interval, 28.0-30.0%] at the lowest strain index decile to 9.3% [8.7-9.9%] at the highest strain index decile; ARF: adjusted probability ranging from 47.2% [45.6-48.9%] at the lowest strain index decile to 12.1% [11.0-13.2%] at the highest strain index decile; P < 0.001 at all deciles). Among subgroups of patients who almost always or never went to the ICU, strain was not associated with hospital length of stay, mortality, or discharge disposition (all P 0.13). Strain was also not meaningfully associated with patient characteristics.Conclusions: Hospital strain, measured by a novel composite strain index, is strongly associated with ICU admission among patients with sepsis and/or ARF. This strain index fulfills the assumptions of a strong within-hospital instrumental variable for quantifying the net benefit of admission to the ICU for patients with sepsis and/or ARF.

Smoking cessation treatment for individuals with comorbid diabetes and serious mental illness in an integrated health care delivery system Smoking is a significant modifiable risk factor for mortality for persons with serious mental illness (SMI), who have a life expectancy 15-20 years shorter than the general population. Individuals with SMI and comorbid diabetes who are smokers face an even higher risk of cardiovascular complications and early death. Yet despite high rates of smoking among people with SMI, tobacco cessation interventions have not been broadly offered to this population. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health records from 2014 in a large integrated care delivery system to examine whether use of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy among smokers with type 2 diabetes varies by serious mental illness (SMI) diagnosis. We analyzed smoking cessation medication prescription fills among adult smokers with diabetes, comparing those with SMI (N = 634) and without SMI (N = 18,021). Risk ratios were adjusted for age, gender, race, urban area type, and medical facility. Of the SMI group, 19.09% filled at least one smoking cessation prescription compared to 9.73% of the non-SMI group (adjusted risk ratio 1.80 [95% CI 1.52-2.13]; p < .001). For the SMI group, primary care providers wrote 80.24% of prescriptions, while psychiatrists wrote 8.81% of prescriptions. These findings offer an example of a delivery system with higher uptake of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy among people with SMI than without SMI, and highlight the opportunity to provide more smoking cessation interventions in mental health care settings.

INTRODUCTION: Smoking is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. While most smokers endorse a desire to quit, achieving abstinence is notoriously difficult. Network analysis is a method for understanding the complex relationships of factors that maintain smoking behavior and impact motivation to quit. METHODS: This study examined self-report prescreen data from treatment-seeking smokers (N = 3913). The number of prior quit attempts and withdrawal symptoms experienced, as well as current smoking behavior and motivation to quit were modeled as interconnected nodes in a network. Two key network metrics were examined: 1) edge weights, which quantify the strength and direction of the associations of interest, and 2) the sum of each node's edge weights, which quantifies the expected influence of a node on the overall network. RESULTS: The withdrawal symptom of craving, r = 0.10, 95% CI [0.07, 0.13] and digestive problems, r = -0.06, 95% CI [-0.09, -0.03], had the strongest positive and negative association with daily cigarettes, respectively. The number of prior quit attempts, r = 0.17, 95% CI [0.14, 0.20], concentration problems, r = -0.04, 95% CI [-0.027, -0.01], showed the strongest positive and negative associations, respectively, with current motivation to quit. Nodes with significant links to current smoking and motivation to quit were also among the most influential in the overall network. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest prior quit experiences and consequences associated with withdrawal symptoms may differentially relate to maintenance of smoking behavior and motivation to quit in treatment-seeking smokers. Interventions targeting key withdrawal symptoms may enhance motivation Oct 1. The impact of prior and ongoing threat on the false alarm threshold for facial discrimination. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Perceptual adaptations that facilitate rapid responses to threats can also lead to false alarms, or the failure to discriminate safe stimuli from signals of threat. We examined the impact of varying degrees of threat on false alarms in the perceptual discrimination of faces along the dimension of emotion (Experiment 1) or identity (Experiment 2). METHODS: Participants first trained to discriminate between a target and nontarget face. Next, we tested their ability to identify the target in randomized presentations of the target, the nontarget, and nine novel stimuli morphed in 10% increments of similarity from the target to the nontarget. The task was completed under one of three randomized conditions: 1) Ongoing-Threat paired the target with an aversive outcome in both phases; 2) Prior-Threat paired the target with an aversive outcome in the training phase only; and 3) No-Threat paired the target with a neutral outcome in the training phase only. RESULTS: In Experiment 1 (N = 90), Ongoing-Threat lowered the false alarm threshold for facial discrimination based on anger intensity compared to Prior-Threat and No-Threat. In Experiment 2 (N = 90), Ongoing-Threat and Prior-Threat each lowered the false alarm threshold for identity-based discrimination compared to No-Threat. LIMITATIONS: The experiment did not measure generalization of threat responses. CONCLUSION: Associating a facial expression or identity with threat leads to faster but less accurate discrimination of faces with similar features, particularly under conditions of ongoing threat. These experiments provide an avenue for examining the parameters that impact false alarms, which play a key role in anxiety disorders. 2020 Oct 1. Estimates of Workload Associated With Suicide Risk Alerts After Implementation of Risk-Prediction Model Authors: Kline-Simon, health records: telemedicine and laboratory follow-up after hospital discharge Continuity of patient information across settings can improve transitions after hospital discharge, but outpatient clinicians often have limited access to complete information from recent hospitalizations. We examined whether providers' timely access to clinical information through shared inpatient-outpatient electronic health records (EHRs) was associated with follow-up visits, return emergency department (ED) visits, or readmissions after hospital discharge in patients with diabetes. Stepped-wedge observational study. As an integrated delivery system staggered implementation of a shared inpatient-outpatient EHR, we studied 241,510 hospital discharges in patients with diabetes (2005-2011), examining rates of outpatient follow-up office visits, telemedicine (phone visits and asynchronous secure messages), laboratory tests, and return ED visits or readmissions (as adverse events). We used multivariate logistic regression adjusting for time trends, patient characteristics, and medical center and accounting for patient clustering to calculate adjusted follow-up rates. For patients with diabetes, provider use of a shared inpatient-outpatient EHR was associated with a statistically significant shift toward follow-up delivered through a combination of telemedicine and outpatient laboratory tests, without a traditional in-person visit (from 22.9% with an outpatient-only EHR to 27.0% with a shared inpatient-outpatient EHR; P < .05). We found no statistically significant differences in 30-day return ED visits (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.09) or readmissions (odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.06) with the shared EHR compared with the outpatient-only EHR. Real-time clinical information availability during transitions between health care settings, along with robust telemedicine access, may shift the method of care delivery without adversely affecting patient health outcomes. Efforts to expand interoperability and information exchange may support follow-up care efficiency. Authors: Reed, Mary; Huang, Manag Care. 2020 10 01;26(10):e327-e332. Epub 2020-10-01. Assessment of Value of Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status in Models That Use Electronic Health Record Data to Predict Health Care Use Rates and Mortality Prediction models are widely used in health care as a way of risk stratifying populations for targeted intervention. Most risk stratification has been done using a small number of predictors from insurance claims. However, the utility of diverse nonclinical predictors, such as neighborhood socioeconomic contexts, remains unknown. To assess the value of using neighborhood socioeconomic predictors in the context of 1-year risk prediction for mortality and 6 different health care use outcomes in a large integrated care system. Diagnostic study using data from all adults age 18 years or older who had Kaiser Foundation Health Plan membership and/or use in the Kaiser Permantente Northern California: a multisite, integrated health care delivery system between January 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014. Data were recorded before the index date for each patient to predict their use and mortality in a 1-year post period using a test-train split for model training and evaluation. Analyses were conducted in fall of 2019. One-year encounter counts (doctor office, virtual, emergency department, elective hospitalizations, and nonelective), total costs, and mortality. A total of 2 951 588 patients met inclusion criteria (mean [SD] age, 47.2 [17.4] years; 47.8% were female). The mean (SD) Neighborhood Deprivation Index was -0.32 (0.84). The areas under the receiver operator curve ranged from 0.71 for emergency department use (using the LASSO method and electronic health record predictors) to 0.94 for mortality (using the random forest method and electronic health record predictors). Neighborhood socioeconomic status predictors did not meaningfully increase the predictive performance of the models for any outcome. In this study, neighborhood socioeconomic predictors did not improve risk estimates compared with what is obtainable using standard claims data regardless of model used. Epub 2020-10-01. Endometrial Cancer retrospective calculation of the EDACS and HEART scores in a multicenter prospective cohort of emergency department chest pain patients Coronary risk scores are commonly applied to emergency department patients with undifferentiated chest pain. Two prominent risk score-based protocols are the Emergency Department Assessment of Chest pain Score Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol (EDACS-ADP) and the History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin (HEART) pathway. Since prospective documentation of these risk determinations can be challenging to obtain, quality improvement projects could benefit from automated retrospective risk score classification methodologies. EDACS-ADP and HEART pathway data elements were prospectively collected using a Web-based electronic clinical decision support (eCDS) tool over a 24-month period (2018-2019) among patients presenting with chest pain to 13 EDs within an integrated health system. Data elements were also extracted and processed electronically (retrospectively) from the electronic health record (EHR) for the same patients. The primary outcome was agreement between the prospective/eCDS and retrospective/EHR data sets on dichotomous risk protocol classification, as assessed by kappa statistics (). There were 12,110 eligible eCDS uses during the study period, of which 66 and 47% were low-risk encounters by EDACS-ADP and HEART pathway, respectively. Agreement on low-risk status was acceptable for EDACS-ADP ( = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.75) and HEART pathway ( = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.68 to 0.70) and for the continuous scores (interclass correlation coefficients = 0.87 and 0.84 for EDACS and HEART, respectively). Automated retrospective determination of low risk status by either the EDACS-ADP or the HEART pathway provides acceptable agreement compared to prospective score calculations, providing a feasible risk adjustment option for use in large data set analyses.

Evaluation of automated computed tomography segmentation to assess body composition and mortality associations in cancer patients Body composition from computed tomography (CT) scans is associated with cancer outcomes including surgical complications, chemotoxicity, and survival. Most studies manually segment CT scans, but Automatic Body composition Analyser using Computed tomography image Segmentation (ABACS) software automatically segments muscle and adipose tissues to speed analysis. Here, we externally evaluate ABACS in an independent dataset. Among patients with non-metastatic colorectal (n = 3102) and breast (n = 2888) cancer diagnosed from 2005 to 2013 at Kaiser Permanente, expert raters annotated tissue areas at the third lumbar vertebra (L3). To compare ABACS segmentation results to manual analysis, we quantified the proportion of pixel-level image overlap using Jaccard scores and agreement between methods using intra-class correlation coefficients for continuous tissue areas. We examined performance overall and among subgroups defined by patient and imaging characteristics. To compare the strength of the mortality associations obtained from ABACS's segmentations to manual analysis, we computed Cox proportional hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) by tertile of tissue area. Mean \u00b1 SD age was 63 \u00b1 11 years for colorectal cancer patients and 56 \u00b1 12 for breast cancer patients. There was strong agreement between manual and automatic segmentations overall and within subgroups of age, sex, body mass index, and cancer stage: average Jaccard scores and intra-class correlation coefficients exceeded 90% for all tissues. ABACS underestimated muscle and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue areas by 1-2% versus manual analysis: mean were small at -2.35, -1.97 and -2.38 cm2 , respectively. ABACS's performance was lowest for the <2% of patients who were underweight or had anatomic abnormalities. ABACS and manual analysis produced similar associations with mortality; comparing the lowest to highest tertile of skeletal muscle from ABACS versus manual analysis, the HRs were 1.23 (95% CI: 1.00-1.52) versus 1.38 (95% versus 1.29 (95% CI: 1.00-1.65) for breast cancer patients. In the first study to externally evaluate a commercially available software to assess body composition, automated segmentation of muscle and adipose tissues using ABACS was similar to manual analysis and associated with mortality after non-metastatic cancer. Automated methods will accelerate body composition research and, eventually, facilitate integration of body composition measures into clinical care. Authors: Cespedes Feliciano Epub 2020-04-20. Examining if the relationship between BMI and incident type 2 diabetes among middle-older aged adults varies by race/ethnicity: evidence from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). AIMS: Disparities persist on the prevalence of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in racial/ethnic minorities in the USA. This study evaluated the association between BMI and incident type 2 diabetes risk by racial/ethnic group, to determine whether BMI and presence of type 2 diabetes risk factors may help clinicians better target type 2 diabetes screening. METHODS: This prospective cohort analysis included 5659 adults free of type 2 diabetes at baseline from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a population-based cohort (2000-2011). BMI was measured at baseline and time-updated at subsequent visits. Incident type 2 diabetes was defined as fasting glucose >/= 7.0 mmol/l, or use of any diabetes medications. RESULTS: The mean (sd) age was 62 (10) years and 42% of participants were white, 26% African American, 20% Hispanic and 12% Chinese American. During follow-up, 696 (12%) new type 2 diabetes cases were observed. In age- and sex-adjusted models, in the presence of one or more type 2 diabetes risk factors (the most common scenario), a 10% risk of incident type 2 diabetes was observed at a BMI of 21.7 kg/m(2) [95% confidence interval (CI) 20.1 to 22.8] in Chinese Americans, 23.8 kg/m(2) (22.7 to 24.9) in Hispanics, 24.7 kg/m(2) (23.7 to 25.6) in African Americans and 26.2 kg/m(2) (25.1 to 26.9) in white participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports including BMI and presence of type 2 diabetes risk factors as action points for clinicians to prioritize which adults aged >/= 45 years should be screened. The application of race/ethnicity-specific BMI thresholds may reduce the disparity of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes observed in minority groups. Epub 2020 Sep 22.

Associations of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 pharmacogenetic variation with phenytoin-induced cutaneous adverse The role of cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C9 and CYP2C19 genetic variation in risk for phenytoin-induced cutaneous adverse drug events is not well understood independently of the human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B)*15:02 risk allele. In the multi-ethnic resource for Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort, we identified 382 participants who filled a phenytoin prescription between 2005 and 2017. These participants included 21 people (5%) who self-identified as Asian, 18 (5%) as black, 29 (8%) as white Hispanic, and 308 (81%) as white non-Hispanic. We identified 264 (69%) CYP2C9*1/*1, 77 (20%) CYP2C9*1/*2, and 29 (8%) CYP2C9*1/*3. We also determined CYP2C19 genotypes, including 112 with the increased activity CYP2C19*17 allele. Using electronic clinical notes, we identified 32 participants (8%) with phenytoin-induced cutaneous adverse events recorded within 100 days of first phenytoin dispensing. Adjusting for age, sex, daily dose, and race/ethnicity, participants with CYP2C9*1/*3 or CYP2C9*2/*2 genotypes were more likely to develop cutaneous adverse events compared with CYP2C9*1/*1 participants (odds ratio 4.47; 95% confidence interval 1.64-11.69; P < 0.01). Among participants with low-intermediate and poor CYP2C9 metabolizer genotypes, eight (22%) who extensive and rapid CYP2C19 metabolizer genotypes experienced cutaneous adverse events, compared with none of those who also had intermediate CYP2C19 metabolizer genotypes (P = 0.17). Genetic variation reducing CYP2C9 metabolic activity may increase risk for phenytoin-induced cutaneous adverse events in the absence 09;13(5):1004-1009. Epub 2020-04-18. Diagnostic Performance of Emergency Physician Gestalt for Predicting Acute Appendicitis in Patients Age 5 to 20 Years Pediatric appendicitis remains a challenging diagnosis in the emergency department (ED). Available risk prediction algorithms may contribute to excessive ED imaging studies. Incorporation of physician gestalt assessment could help refine predictive tools and improve diagnostic imaging decisions. This study was a subanalysis of a parent study that prospectively enrolled patients ages 5 to 20.9 years with a chief complaint of abdominal pain presenting to 11 community EDs within an integrated delivery system between October 1, 2016, and September 30, 2018. Prior to diagnostic imaging, attending emergency physicians enrolled patients with 5 days of right-sided or diffuse abdominal pain using a Web-based application embedded in the electronic health record. Predicted risk (gestalt) of acute appendicitis was prospectively entered using a sliding scale from 1% to 100%. As a planned secondary analysis, we assessed the performance of gestalt via c-statistics of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves; tested associations between gestalt performance and patient, physician, and facility characteristics; and examined clinical characteristics affecting gestalt estimates. Of 3,426 patients, 334 (9.8%) had confirmed appendicitis. Physician gestalt had excellent ROC curve characteristics (c-statistic = 0.83, 95% confidence interval = 0.81 to 0.85), performing particularly well in the low-risk strata (appendicitis rate = 1.1% in gestalt 1%-10% range, negative predictive value of 98.9% for appendicitis diagnosis). Physicians with 5 years since medical school graduation demonstrated improved gestalt performance over those with less experience (p = 0.007). All clinical characteristics tested, except pain <24 hours, were significantly associated with physician gestalt value (p < 0.05). Physician gestalt for acute appendicitis diagnosis performed well, especially in low-risk patients and when employed by experienced physicians. Authors: Cardiac Troponin Assay. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to describe the rates of diagnostic reclassification between conventional cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and high-sensitivity cardiac T (hs-cTnT) and between combined and sex-specific hs-cTnT thresholds in adult emergency department (ED) patients in the United States. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-center, before-and-after, observational study of ED patients aged 18 years or older undergoing single or serial cardiac troponin testing in the ED for any reason before and after hs-cTnT implementation. Conventional cTnI and hs-cTnT results were obtained from a laboratory quality assurance database. Combined and sex-specific thresholds were the published 99th percentile upper reference limits for each assay. Cases underwent physician adjudication using the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Diagnostic reclassification occurred when a patient received a diagnosis of myocardial infarction or myocardial injury with one assay but not the other assay. Our primary outcome was diagnostic reclassification between the conventional cTnI and hs-cTnT assays. Diagnostic reclassification probabilities were assessed with sample proportions and 95% confidence intervals for binomial data. RESULTS: We studied 1,016 patients (506 men [50%]; median age 60 years [25th, 75th percentiles 49, 71]). Between the conventional cTnI patients 95% infarction 95% confidence interval 19%) underwent diagnostic reclassification regarding myocardial injury (154/166 reclassified as having myocardial injury) hs-cTnT. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional cTnI, the hs-cTnT assay resulted in no clinically relevant change in myocardial infarction diagnoses but substantially more myocardial 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2020.06.047.

Study protocol: Using peer support to aid in prevention and treatment in prediabetes (UPSTART) There is an urgent need to develop and evaluate effective and scalable interventions to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this randomized controlled pragmatic trial, 296 adults with prediabetes will be randomized to either a peer support arm or enhanced usual care. Participants in the peer support arm meet face-to-face initially with a trained peer coach who also is a patient at the same health center to receive information on locally available wellness and diabetes prevention programs, discuss behavioral goals related to diabetes prevention, and develop an action plan for the next week to meet their goals. Over six months, peer coaches call their assigned participants weekly to provide support for weekly action steps. In the final 6 months, coaches call participants at least once monthly. Participants in the enhanced usual care arm receive information on local resources and periodic updates on available diabetes prevention programs and resources. Changes in A1c, weight, waist circumference and other patient-centered outcomes and mediators and moderators of intervention effects will be assessed. At least 296 participants and approximately 75 peer supporters will be enrolled. Despite evidence that healthy lifestyle interventions can improve health behaviors and reduce risk for T2DM, engagement in recommended behavior change is low. This is especially true among racial and ethnic minority and low-income adults. Regular outreach and ongoing support from a peer coach may help participants to initiate and sustain healthy behavior changes to reduce their risk of diabetes.

A Transparent and Adaptable Method to Extract Colonoscopy and Pathology Data Using Natural Language Processing Key variables recorded as text in colonoscopy and pathology reports have been extracted using natural language processing (NLP) tools that were not easily adaptable to new settings. We aimed to develop a reliable NLP tool with broad adaptability. During 1996-2016, Kaiser Permanente Northern California performed 401,566 colonoscopies with linked pathology. We randomly sampled 1000 linked reports into a Training Set and developed an NLP tool using SAS\u00ae PERL regular expressions. The NLP tool captured five colonoscopy and pathology variables: type, size, and location of polyps; extent of procedure; and quality of bowel preparation. We used a Validation Set (N = 3000) to confirm the variables' classifications using manual chart review as the reference. Performance of the NLP tool was assessed using the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and Cohen's . Cohen's ranged from 93 to 99%. The sensitivity and specificity ranged from 95 to 100% across all categories. For categories with prevalence exceeding 10%, the PPV ranged from 97% to 100% except for adequate quality of preparation (prevalence 92%), for which the PPV was 65%. For categories with prevalence below 10%, the PPVs ranged from 62% to 100%. NPVs ranged from 94% to 100% except for the \"complete\" extent of procedure, for which the NPV was 73%. Using information from a large community-based population, we developed a transparent and adaptable NLP tool for extracting five colonoscopy and pathology variables. The tool can be readily tested in other healthcare settings. Authors: Fevrier, Helene B; Liu, Liyan; Herrinton, Syst. 2020 Jul 31;44(9):151. Epub 2020-07-31. Reply to 2020-03-28. Hospitalization is less common in ambulatory patients with acute pulmonary embolism diagnosed before emergency department referral than after arrival Emergency department (ED) patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) may undergo diagnostic pulmonary imaging as an outpatient before referral to the ED for definitive management. This population has not been well characterized. This retrospective cohort study included ambulatory adults with acute objectively confirmed PE across 21 EDs in an integrated health care system from January 1, 2013, through April 30, 2015. We excluded patients arriving by ambulance. We compared outpatients with diagnostic pulmonary imaging in the 12 hours prior to ED arrival (the clinic-based cohort) with those receiving imaging for PE only after ED arrival. We reported adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hospitalization, adjusted for race, presyncope or syncope, proximal clot location, and PE Severity Index class. Among 2,352 eligible ED patients with acute PE, 344 (14.6%) had a clinic-based diagnosis. This cohort had lower PE Severity Index classification and were less likely to be hospitalized than their counterparts with an ED-based diagnosis: 80.8% vs. 92.0% (p < 0.0001). The inverse association with hospitalization persisted after adjusting for the above patient characteristics with aOR of 0.36 (95% CI = 0.26 to 0.50). In the study setting, ambulatory outpatients with acute PE are commonly diagnosed before ED arrival. A clinic-based diagnosis of PE identifies ED patients less likely to be hospitalized. Research is needed to identify which patients with a clinic-based PE diagnosis may not require transfer to the ED before home discharge. Authors: Vinson DR; Bath H; 2020-07-05. Design of a cluster-randomized trial of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of metformin on prevention of type 2 diabetes among prediabetic Mexican adults (the PRuDENTE initiative of Mexico City). INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global epidemic, and nations are struggling to implement effective healthcare strategies to reduce the burden. While efficacy studies demonstrate that metformin can reduce incident T2D by half among younger, obese adults with prediabetes, its real-world effectiveness are understudied, and its use for T2D prevention in primary care is low. We describe the design of a pragmatic trial to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of metformin, as an adjunct to a simple lifestyle counseling. METHODS: The \"Prevencion de la Diabetes con Ejercicio, Nutricion y Tratamiento\" [Diabetes Prevention with Exercise, Nutrition and Treatment; PRuDENTE, (Spanish acronym)] is a cluster-randomized trial in Mexico City's public primary healthcare system. The study randomly assigns 51 clinics to deliver one of two interventions for 36months: 1) lifestyle only; 2) lifestyle plus metformin, to 3060 patients ages 30-65 with impaired fasting glucose and obesity. The primary endpoint is incident T2D (fasting glucose >/=126mg/dL, or HbA1c >/=6.5%). We will also measure a range of implementation-related process outcomes at the clinic-, clinician- and patient-levels to inform interpretations of effectiveness and enable efforts to refine, adapt, adopt and disseminate the model. We will also estimate the cost-effectiveness of metformin as an adjunct to lifestyle counseling in Mexico. DISCUSSION: Findings from this pragmatic trial will generate new translational knowledge in Mexico and beyond, both with respect to metformin's real-world effectiveness among an 'at-risk' population, and uncovering facilitators and barriers to the reach, adoption and implementation of metformin preventive therapy in public primary care settings.

Developing a template matching algorithm for benchmarking hospital performance in a diverse, integrated healthcare system Template matching is a proposed approach for hospital benchmarking, which measures performance based on matching a subset of comparable patient hospitalizations from each hospital. We assessed the ability to create the required matched samples and thus the feasibility of template matching to benchmark hospital performance in a diverse healthcare system.Nationwide Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals, 2017.Observational cohort study.We used administrative and clinical data from 668,592 hospitalizations at 134 VA hospitals in 2017. A standardized template of 300 hospitalizations was selected, and then 300 hospitalizations were matched to the template from each hospital.There was substantial case-mix variation across VA hospitals, which persisted after excluding small hospitals, hospitals with primarily psychiatric admissions, and hospitalizations for rare diagnoses. Median age ranged from 57 to 75 years across hospitals; percent surgical admissions ranged from 0.0% to 21.0%; percent of admissions through the emergency department, 0.1% to 98.7%; and percent Hispanic patients, 0.2% to 93.3%. Characteristics for which there was substantial variation across hospitals could not be balanced with any matching algorithm tested. Although most other variables could be balanced, we were unable to identify a matching algorithm that balanced more than 20 variables simultaneously.We were unable to identify a template matching approach that could balance hospitals on all measured characteristics potentially important to benchmarking. Given the magnitude of case-mix variation across VA hospitals, a single template is likely not feasible for general hospital benchmarking. Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Jun 12;99(24):e20385.

Differences in Diet Quality among Multiple US Racial/Ethnic Groups from the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) Study and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). BACKGROUND: Diet quality is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Little is known about the diet quality of South Asians in the United States, a group with higher rates of T2D and CVD compared with other racial/ethnic groups. OBJECTIVE: This study determined whether diet quality differs between South Asian adults in the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) Study and whites, Chinese Americans, African Americans, and Hispanics in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 3926 participants free of CVD from MESA visit 5 (2010-2011) and 889 South Asian participants from MASALA visit 1 (2010-2013) were pooled. Diet quality was assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010) derived using FFQs. Multivariable linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, and total energy intake were used to compare mean differences in diet quality between the racial/ethnic groups. RESULTS: MESA participants were, on average, 14 y older than MASALA participants. The adjusted mean (95% CI) scores for the AHEI-2010 were 70.2 (69.5, 70.9) among South Asians, 66.2 (66.3, 59.7) among Hispanics, 57.5 (56.9, 58.1) among African Americans. The mean AHEI scores among South Asians were 3.1 (1.8, 4.3), 9.2 (8.3, 10.1), 11.2 (10.2, 12.3), and 12.8 (11.8, 13.7) points higher compared with Chinese Americans, whites, Hispanics, and African Americans, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: South Asian adults in the United States have a higher diet quality compared with other racial/ethnic groups. This paradoxical finding is not consistent with the observed higher rates of T2D and CVD compared with other groups. This is further evidence of the importance of studying the South Asian population to better understand the causes of chronic disease not explained by diet quality.

Importance: Findings suggest that the efficacy of D-cycloserine (DCS) for enhancing exposure therapy may be strongest when administered after sessions marked by low fear at the conclusion of exposure practice. These findings have prompted investigation of DCS dosing tailored to results of exposure sessions. Objective: To compare tailored postsession DCS administration with presession DCS administration, postsession DCS administration, and placebo augmentation of exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder. Design, Setting, and Participants: This double-blind randomized clinical trial involved adults with social anxiety disorder enrolled at 3 US university centers. Symptom severity was assessed at baseline, weekly during treatment, and at 1-week and 3-month follow-up. Data analysis was performed from September 2019 to March 2020. Interventions: Participants completed a 5-session treatment and received pills commensurate with their condition assignment at sessions 2 through 5, which emphasized exposure practice. Main Outcomes and Measures: Symptom severity was evaluated by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and Social Phobic Disorders-Severity Form as administered by independent evaluators. Results: A total of 152 participants were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 29.24 [10.16] years; 84 men [55.26%]). Compared with placebo, presession and postsession conditions showed greater symptom improvement (b = -0.25; 95% CI, -0.37 to -0.13; P < .001; and b = -0.20; 95% CI, -0.32 to -0.07; P = .002; d = 0.85) and lower symptom severity (b = -0.51; 95% CI, -0.81 to -0.21; P < .001; and b = -0.49; 95% CI, -0.80 to = .002; d = 0.72) at 3-month follow-up. No differences were found between presession and postsession conditions. The tailored condition showed no advantage over placebo. Compared with the tailored condition, presession and postsession conditions evidenced greater decreases (b = -0.22; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.10; P < .001; and b = -0.17, 95% CI, -0.29 to -0.04; P = .008; d = 0.72) and lower symptom severity (b = -0.44, 95% CI, -0.73 to -0.14; P = .004; and b = -0.41, 95% CI, -0.72 to = at 3-month follow-up. Conclusions and Relevance: Administration of DCS enhanced exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder when given before or after the exposure session. However, the study failed to achieve the aim to develop a tailored clinical application. associated with 5-year weight trajectories within the PORTAL Overweight/Obesity Cohort The purpose of this study was to model weight trajectories over a 5-year time period (2012-2016) and their association with behavioural and psychosocial characteristics and health care-related experiences using data from the Patient Outcomes Research to Advance Learning (PORTAL) overweight/obesity cohort. Weight trajectories for each eligible patient in the PORTAL overweight/obesity cohort (n = 2864) were identified first using growth modelling; trajectories were then grouped using a hierarchical cluster analysis. Weight trajectory clusters that emerged were compared on demographics, and predictors of cluster membership were examined. Clusters were also compared on responses to a survey assessing health behaviours, quality of life, and health care experience completed in 2015 by 49% of the total sample (n = 1391). Seven distinct weight trajectory clusters were identified: (a) significant weight loss then maintenance; (b) higher stable weight; (c) moderate stable weight; (d) steady weight loss then relapse; (e) weight gain then weight loss; (f) steady weight gain then maintenance; and (g) lower stable weight. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index at baseline predicted patient's weight trajectory (P < .001). Over two thirds of patients maintained their weight over the 5-year period. Significant weight loss then maintenance, weight gain then weight loss, and higher stable weight patients were more likely to report receiving weight counselling from their provider. Patients in the significant weight loss then maintenance and lower stable weight clusters were more likely to be physically active than the other clusters. Findings suggest variability in patterns of weight change among adults with overweight or obesity who have access to health care and that these patterns differ on demographic, behavioural and psychosocial factors, and health care 2020-02-27. Patient Characteristics Associated With Choosing a Telemedicine Visit vs Office Visit With the Same Primary Care Clinicians Video or telephone telemedicine can offer patients access to a clinician without arranging for transportation or spending time in a waiting room, but little is known about patient characteristics associated with choosing between telemedicine or office visits. To examine patient characteristics associated with choosing a telemedicine visit vs office visit with the same primary care clinicians. This cross-sectional study included data from 1 131 722 patients who scheduled a primary care appointment through the Kaiser Permanente Northern California patient portal between January 1, 2016, and May 31, 2018. All completed primary care appointments booked via the patient portal were identified. Only index visits without any other clinical visits within 7 days were included to define a relatively distinct patient-initiated care-seeking episode. Visits for routine physical, which are not telemedicine-eligible, were excluded. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019. Patient choice between an office, video, or telephone visit. Relative risk ratios (RRRs) for patient sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, neighborhood socioeconomic status, language preference), technology access (neighborhood residential internet, mobile portal use), visiting the patient's own personal primary care clinician, and in-person visit barriers (travel-time, parking, cost-sharing), associated with choice of video or telephone telemedicine (vs office visit). Of 2 178 440 patient-scheduled primary care visits scheduled by 1 131 722 patients, 86% were scheduled as office visits and 14% as telemedicine visits, with 7% of the telemedicine visits by video. Choosing telemedicine was statistically significantly associated with patient sociodemographic characteristics. For example, patients aged 65 years and over were less likely than patients aged 18 to 44 years to choose telemedicine (RRR, 0.54-0.57 for telephone visit). Choosing telemedicine was also statistically significantly associated with technology access (patients living in a neighborhood with high rates of residential internet access were more likely to choose a video visit than patients whose neighborhoods had low internet access: RRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.06-1.14); as well as in-person visit barriers (patients whose clinic had a paid parking structure were more likely to choose a telemedicine visit than patients whose facility had free parking: RRR, 95% CI, 1.61-1.86 for telephone visit). In this cross-sectional study, patients usually chose an in-person visit when scheduling an appointment online through the portal. Telemedicine may offer the potential to reach vulnerable patient groups and improve access for patients with transportation, parking, or cost barriers to clinic visits.

Recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis and cognitive function among older adults with type 1 diabetes: findings from the Study of Longevity in Diabetes Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of diabetes. DKA is associated with poorer cognition in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but whether this is the case in older adults with T1D is unknown. Given the increasing life expectancy in T1D, understanding the role of DKA on brain health in older adults is crucial. We examined the association of DKA with cognitive function in 714 older adults with T1D from the Study of Longevity in Diabetes. Participants self-reported lifetime exposure to DKA resulting in hospitalization; DKA was categorized into 0 hospitalization, 1 hospitalization or 2 hospitalizations (recurrent DKA). Global and domain-specific cognition (language, executive function/psychomotor speed, episodic memory and simple attention) were assessed. The association of DKA with cognitive function was evaluated via linear and logistic regression models. Twenty-eight percent of participants (mean age=67 years; mean age at diagnosis=28 years; average duration of diabetes=39 years) reported a lifetime history of DKA resulting in hospitalization (18.5% single DKA; 9.7% recurrent DKA). In fully adjusted models, those with recurrent DKA had lower global cognitive function (=-0.13; 95% CI -0.22 to 0.02) and lower scores on the executive function/psychomotor speed domain (=-0.34; 95% CI -0.51 to 0.17). Individuals with recurrent DKA were also more likely to have the lowest level of cognitive function on the executive function/psychomotor speed domain (defined as 1.5 SD below the population mean; OR=3.26, 95% CI 1.43 to 7.42). Among 714 older adults with T1D, recurrent DKA was associated with lower global cognitive function, lower scores on the executive function/psychomotor speed domain and 3.3 times greater risk of having the lowest level of cognitive function in our sample on the executive function/psychomotor speed domain. These findings suggest that recurrent DKA may negatively impact the brain health of older patients with T1D and highlight the importance of DKA prevention. 06;8(1). Telehealth in Oncology During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Bringing the House Call Back clinical outcomes, and transmission dynamics of severe coronavirus disease 2019 in California and Washington: prospective cohort study To understand the epidemiology and burden of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) during the first epidemic wave on the west coast of the United States. Prospective cohort study. Kaiser Permanente integrated healthcare delivery systems serving populations in northern California, southern California, and Washington state. 1840 people with a first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19 by 22 April 2020, among 9 596 321 healthcare plan enrollees. Analyses of hospital length of stay and clinical outcomes included 1328 people admitted by 9 April 2020 (534 in northern California, 711 in southern California, and 83 in Washington). Cumulative incidence of first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19, and subsequent probabilities of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality, as well as duration of hospital stay and ICU stay. The effective reproduction number (RE ) describing transmission dynamics was estimated for each region. As of 22 April 2020, cumulative incidences of a first acute hospital admission for covid-19 were 15.6 per 100 000 cohort members in northern California, 23.3 per 100 000 in southern California, and 14.7 per 100 000 in Washington. Accounting for censoring of incomplete hospital stays among those admitted by 9 April 2020, the estimated median duration of stay among survivors was 9.3 days (with 95% staying 0.8 to 32.9 days) and among non-survivors was 12.7 days (1.6 to 37.7 days). The censoring adjusted probability of ICU admission for male patients was 48.5% (95% confidence interval 41.8% to 56.3%) and for female patients was 32.0% (26.6% to 38.4%). For patients requiring critical care, the median duration of ICU stay was 10.6 days (with 95% staying 1.3 to 30.8 days). The censoring adjusted case fatality ratio was 23.5% (95% confidence interval 19.6% to 28.2%) among 14.9% (11.8% to 18.6%) among female inpatients; mortality risk increased with age for both male and female patients. Reductions in RE were identified over the study period within each region. Among residents of California and Washington state enrolled in Kaiser Permanente healthcare plans who were admitted to hospital with covid-19, the probabilities of ICU admission, of long hospital stay, and of mortality were identified to be high. Incidence rates of new hospital admissions have stabilized or declined in conjunction with implementation of social distancing interventions. Authors: Lewnard JA; Liu VX; Epub 2020-05-22.

Initial Glycemic Control and Care Among Younger Adults Diagnosed With Type 2 Diabetes The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing among adults under age 45. Onset of type 2 diabetes at a younger age increases an individual's risk for diabetes-related complications. Given the lasting benefits conferred by early glycemic control, we compared glycemic control and initial care between adults with younger onset (21-44 years) and mid-age onset (45-64 years) of type 2 diabetes. Using data from a large, integrated health care system, we identified 32,137 adults (aged 21-64 years) with incident diabetes (first HbA1c 6.5% [48 mmol/mol]). We excluded anyone with evidence of prior type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, or type 1 diabetes. We used generalized linear mixed models, adjusting for demographic and clinical variables, to examine differences in glycemic control and care at 1 year. Of identified individuals, 26.4% had younger-onset and 73.6% had mid-age-onset type 2 diabetes. Adults with younger onset had higher initial mean HbA1c values (8.9% [74 mmol/mol]) than adults (8.4% [68 mmol/mol]) (P < 0.0001) achieving an HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) 1 year after the diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.70 [95% CI 0.66-0.74]), even after accounting for HbA1c at diagnosis. Adults with younger onset had lower odds of in-person primary care contact (aOR 0.82 [95% CI 0.76-0.89]) than those with onset during mid-age, but they did not differ in telephone contact (1.05 [0.99-1.10]). Adults with younger onset had higher odds of starting metformin (aOR 1.20 [95% CI 1.12-1.29]) but lower odds of adhering to that medication (0.74 [0.69-0.80]). Adults with onset of type 2 diabetes at a younger age were less likely to achieve glycemic control at 1 year following diagnosis, suggesting the need for tailored care approaches to improve outcomes for this high-risk patient Epub 2020-03-04. The Impact of Step-Down Unit Care on Patient Outcomes After ICU Discharge To examine whether and how step-down unit admission after ICU discharge affects patient outcomes. Retrospective study using an instrumental variable approach to remove potential biases from unobserved differences in illness severity for patients admitted to the step-down unit after ICU discharge. Ten hospitals in an integrated healthcare delivery system in Northern California. Eleven-thousand fifty-eight episodes involving patients who were admitted via emergency departments to a medical service from July 2010 to June 2011, were admitted to the ICU at least once during their hospitalization, and were discharged from the ICU to the step-down unit or the ward. None. Using congestion in the step-down unit as an instrumental variable, we quantified the impact of step-down unit care in terms of clinical and operational outcomes. On average, for ICU patients with lower illness severity, we found that availability of step-down unit care was associated with an absolute decrease in the likelihood of hospital readmission within 30 days of 3.9% (95% CI, 3.6-4.1%). We did not find statistically significant effects on other outcomes. For ICU patients with higher illness severity, we found that availability of step-down unit care was associated with an absolute decrease in in-hospital mortality of 2.5% (95% CI, 2.3-2.6%), a decrease in remaining hospital length-of-stay of 1.1 days (95% CI, 1.0-1.2 d), and a decrease in the likelihood of ICU readmission within 5 days of 3.6% (95% CI, 3.3-3.8%). This study shows that there exists a subset of patients discharged from the ICU who may benefit from care in an step-down unit relative to that in the ward. We found that step-down unit care was associated with statistically significant improvements in patient outcomes especially for high-risk patients. Our results suggest that step-down units can provide effective transitional care for ICU patients. Authors: Lekwijit S; Chan May;2(5):e0114. Epub 2020-05-06. Comparison of Early Warning Scoring Systems for Hospitalized Patients With and Without Infection at Risk for In-Hospital Mortality and Transfer to the Intensive Care Unit Risk scores used in early warning systems exist for general inpatients and patients with suspected infection outside the intensive care unit (ICU), but their relative performance is incompletely characterized. To compare the performance of tools used to determine points-based risk scores among all hospitalized patients, including those with and without suspected infection, for identifying those at risk for death and/or ICU transfer. In a cohort design, a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted in 21 California and 7 Illinois hospitals between 2006 and 2018 among adult inpatients outside the ICU using points-based scores from 5 commonly used tools: National Early Warning Score (NEWS), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), Between the Flags (BTF), Quick Sequential Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). Data analysis was conducted from February 2019 to January 2020. Risk model discrimination was assessed in each state for predicting in-hospital mortality and the combined outcome of ICU transfer or mortality with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). Stratified analyses were also conducted based on suspected infection. The study included 773 477 hospitalized patients in California (mean [SD] age, 65.1 [17.6] years; 416 605 women [53.9%]) and Illinois 61.3 [19.9] years; 384 830 women [53.9%]). The exhibited highest discrimination for mortality (AUC, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.87-0.87 in California vs AUC, CI, 0.73-0.74 in Illinois). At specific decision thresholds, the NEWS outperformed the SIRS and qSOFA at all 28 hospitals either by reducing the percentage of at-risk patients who need to be screened by 5% to 20% or increasing the percentage of adverse outcomes identified by 3% to 25%. In all hospitalized patients evaluated in this study, including those meeting criteria for suspected infection, the NEWS appeared to display the highest discrimination. Our results suggest that, among commonly used points-based scoring systems, determining the NEWS for inpatient risk stratification could identify patients with and without infection at high risk of mortality.

Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Diabetes Care Quality among Women of Reproductive Age in an Integrated Delivery System Diabetes is increasingly prevalent among women of reproductive age, yet little is known about quality of diabetes care for this population at increased risk of diabetes complications and poor maternal and infant health outcomes. Previous studies have identified racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes care, but patterns among women of reproductive age have not been examined. This retrospective cohort study analyzed 2016 data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated delivery system. Outcomes were quality of diabetes care measures-glycemic testing, glycemic control, and medication adherence-among women ages 18 to 44 with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (N = 9,923). Poisson regression was used to estimate the association between patient race/ethnicity and each outcome, adjusting for other patient characteristics and health care use. In this cohort, 83% of participants had type 2 diabetes; 31% and 36% of women with type 2 and type 1 diabetes, respectively, had poor glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c of 9%), and approximately one-third of women with type 2 diabetes exhibited nonadherence to diabetes medications. Compared with non-Hispanic White women with type 2 diabetes, non-Hispanic Black women (adjusted risk ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.3) and Hispanic women (adjusted risk ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.3) were more likely to have poor control. Findings among women with type 1 diabetes were similar. Our findings indicate opportunities to decrease disparities and improve quality of diabetes care for reproductive-aged women. Elucidating the contributing factors to poor glycemic control and medication adherence in this population, particularly among Black, Hispanic, and Asian women, should be a high research and practice priority. Authors: Marshall CJ; Rodriguez HP; Dyer W; Schmittdiel Response-to-Treatment for Comorbid Post-Traumatic Stress and Disorders: The Value of Combining Person- and Variable-Centered Approaches. Optimizing treatment for co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorder (PTSD+SUD) is critically important. Whereas treatments have been designed that target PTSD+SUD with some success, these treatments do not benefit all. Data-driven approaches that combine person- and variable-centered methods, such as parallel process latent class growth analysis (PP-LCGA) can be used to identify response-to-treatment trajectories across both PTSD symptoms and substance use. The current study employed PP-LCGA separately in two randomized clinical trials (study 1 n = 81, Mean age = 40.4 years, SD = 10.7; study 2 n = 59, Mean age = 44.7 years, SD = 9.4) to examine PTSD symptom response and percentage of days using substances across treatment trials comparing Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and SUD using Prolonged Exposure and Relapse Prevention. Results revealed four PTSD+SUD profiles for study one and three PTSD+SUD profiles for study two. For PTSD symptoms, response trajectories could be broadly classified into treatment responders and non-responders across both studies. For substance use, response trajectories could be broadly classified into declining, moderately stable, and abstaining profiles. When considering PTSD symptoms and substance use trajectories together, profiles emerged that would have been missed had these treatment outcomes been considered separately.

Isradipine enhancement of virtual reality cue exposure for smoking cessation: Rationale and study protocol for a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Cigarette smoking remains a leading cause of preventable death in the United States, contributing to over 480,000 deaths each year. Although significant strides have been made in the development of effective smoking cessation treatments, most established interventions are associated with high relapse rates. One avenue for increasing the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions is to design focused, efficient, and rigorous experiments testing engagement of well-defined mechanistic targets. Toward this aim, the current protocol will apply a pharmacologic augmentation strategy informed by basic research in animal models of addiction. Our goal is to evaluate the enhancing effect of isradipine, an FDA-approved calcium channel blocker, on the extinction of craving-a key mechanism of drug relapse after periods of abstinence. To activate craving robustly in human participants, we will use multimodal smoking cues including novel 360 degrees video environments developed for this project and delivered through consumer virtual reality headsets. Adult smokers will take either isradipine or placebo and complete the cue exposure protocol in a double-blind randomized control trial. In order to test the hypothesis that isradipine will enhance retention of craving extinction, participants will repeat cue exposure 24h later without the administration of isradipine or placebo. The study will be implemented in a primary care setting where adult smokers receive healthcare, and smoking behavior will be tracked throughout the trial with ecological momentary assessment. 2020 Apr 24.

Exploiting nonsystematic covariate monitoring to broaden the scope of evidence about the causal effects of adaptive treatment strategies In studies based on electronic health records (EHR), the frequency of covariate monitoring can vary by covariate type, across patients, and over time, which can limit the generalizability of inferences about the effects of adaptive treatment strategies. In addition, monitoring is a health intervention in itself with costs and benefits, and stakeholders may be interested in the effect of monitoring when adopting adaptive treatment strategies. This paper demonstrates how to exploit nonsystematic covariate monitoring in EHR-based studies to both improve the generalizability of causal inferences and to evaluate the health impact of monitoring when evaluating adaptive treatment strategies. Using a real world, EHR-based, comparative effectiveness research (CER) study of patients with type II diabetes mellitus, we illustrate how the evaluation of joint dynamic treatment and static monitoring interventions can improve CER evidence and describe two alternate estimation approaches based on inverse probability weighting (IPW). First, we demonstrate the poor performance of the standard estimator of the effects of joint treatment-monitoring interventions, due to a large decrease in data support and concerns over finite-sample bias from near-violations of the positivity assumption (PA) for the monitoring process. Second, we detail an alternate IPW estimator using a no direct effect assumption. We demonstrate that this estimator can improve efficiency but at the potential cost of increase in bias from violations of the PA for the treatment process.

Presyncope Is Associated with Intensive Care Unit Admission in Emergency Department Patients with Acute Pulmonary Embolism Syncope is common among emergency department (ED) patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and indicates a higher acuity and worse prognosis than in patients without syncope. Whether presyncope carries the same prognostic implications has not been established. We compared incidence of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in three groups of ED PE patients: those with presyncope; syncope; and neither. This retrospective cohort study included all adults with acute, objectively confirmed PE in 21 community EDs from January 2013-April 2015. We combined electronic health record extraction with manual chart abstraction. We used chi-square test for univariate comparisons and performed multivariate analysis to evaluate associations between presyncope or syncope and ICU admission from the ED, reported as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Among 2996 PE patients, 82 (2.7%) had presyncope and 109 (3.6%) had syncope. ICU admission was similar between groups (presyncope 18.3% vs syncope 25.7%) and different than their (either 22.5% vs neither 4.7%; p<0.0001). On multivariate analysis, both presyncope and syncope were independently associated with ICU admission, controlling for demographics, higher-risk PE Severity Index (PESI) class, ventilatory support, were only minimally affected when excluding massive PE from the model. There was no significant interaction between either syncope or presyncope and PESI, submassive or massive classification in predicting ICU admission. Presyncope appears to carry similar strength of association with ICU admission as syncope in ED patients with acute PE. If this is confirmed, clinicians evaluating patients with acute PE may benefit from including presyncope in their calculus of risk assessment and site-of-care decision-making. Authors: Vinson DR; Reed ME; Mark the Affordable Care Act on Colorectal Cancer Outcomes: A Systematic Review The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act increases healthcare access and includes provisions that directly impact access to and cost of evidence-based colorectal cancer screening. The Affordable Care Act's removal of cost sharing for colorectal cancer screening as well as Medicaid expansion have been hypothesized to increase screening and improve other health outcomes. However, since its passage in 2010, there is little consensus on the Affordable Care Act's impact. Data from March 2010 to June 2019 were reviewed and 21 relevant studies were identified; 19 studies examined colorectal cancer screening with most finding increased screening rates. Eleven studies found significant increases, 5 found nonsignificant increases, 3 found nonsignificant decreases, and 1 study found a significant decrease in colorectal cancer screening. Three studies examined the impact on colorectal cancer incidence and stage of diagnosis, where a significant 2.4% increase in early diagnosis was found in one and a nonsignificant increase in incidence in another. However, survival improved after Medicaid expansion. Free preventive colorectal cancer screening and Medicaid expansion because of passage of the Affordable Care Act have been, in general, positively associated with modest improvements in screening rates across the country. Future studies are needed that investigate the longer-term impact of the Affordable Care Act on colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality rates, as screening is only the first step in treatment of cancerous and precancerous lesions, preventing them from progressing. Moreover, more studies examining subpopulations are needed to better assess where gaps in care remain. Authors: Xu MR; Kelly AMB; Kushi Med. 2020 04;58(4):596-603. Epub 2020-01-31.

Red blood cell transfusions for emergency department patients with gastrointestinal bleeding within an integrated health system To assess trends over time in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion practice among emergency department (ED) patients with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within an integrated healthcare system, inclusive of 21 EDs. Retrospective cohort of ED patients diagnosed with GI bleeding between July 1st, 2012 and September 30th, 2016. The primary outcome was receipt of an RBC transfusion in the ED. Secondary outcomes included 90-day rates of RBC transfusion, repeat ED visits, rehospitalization, and all-cause mortality. Logistic regression was used to obtain confounder-adjusted outcome rates. A total of 24,868 unique patient encounters were used for the primary analysis. The median hemoglobin level in the ED prior to RBC transfusion decreased from 7.5 g/dl to 6.9 g/dl in the first versus last twelve months of the study period (p < 0.0001). A small trend was observed in the overall adjusted rate of ED RBC transfusion (absolute quarterly change of -0.1%, R2 = 0.18, p = 0.0001) largely attributable to the subgroup of patients with hemoglobin nadirs between 7.0 and 9.9 g/dl (absolute quarterly change of -0.4%, R2 = 0.38, p < 0.0001). Rates of RBC transfusions through 90 days likewise decreased (absolute quarterly change of -0.4%, R2 = 0.85, p < 0.0001) with stable to decreased corresponding rates of repeat ED visits, rehospitalizations and mortality. Rates of ED RBC transfusion decreased over time among patients with GI bleeding, particularly in those with hemoglobin nadirs between 7.0 and 9.9 g/dl. These findings suggest that ED providers are willing to adopt evidence-based restrictive RBC transfusion recommendations for patients with GI bleeding.

PURPOSE: We investigated whether the relationship between diabetes and all-cause and CVD-related mortality differed between women with and without breast cancer among a cohort drawn from the same source population. METHODS: We interviewed 1,363 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996-1997, and 1,358 age-matched women without breast cancer, to assess history of physician-diagnosed diabetes. All-cause (n = 631) and CVD-specific mortality (n = 234) was determined by the National Death Index through 2009. We estimated multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the rates of all-cause and CVD-specific mortality and, to account for competing causes of death, and subdistribution HRs (sHRs) for risk of CVD-related death. RESULTS: Among women with and without breast cancer, respectively, diabetes was associated with: all-cause mortality [HR (95% CI) 1.52 (1.13, (1.46, 3.22)]; CVD-specific deaths [1.74 (1.06, 2.84) and 2.06 3.84)]; and risk of CVD-related death [sHR 1.36 (0.81, 2.27) and 1.79 (0.94, 3.40)]. Differences in effect estimates between women with and without breast cancer did not reach statistical significance (p-interaction > 0.10). CONCLUSION: We found that the positive association between a history of physician-diagnosed diabetes and risk of all-cause and CVD-related mortality is of similar magnitude among a population-based cohort of women with or without breast 10.1007/s10552-020-01292-2.

Testing patient-informed approaches for visually depicting the hemoglobin A1c value to patients with poorly controlled diabetes: a randomized, controlled trial Patients' understanding of the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has been linked to better diabetes care outcomes (glycemic control, self-care). This is concerning given low documented rates of HbA1c understanding. In this non-blinded, randomized trial, we compared two formats for communicating the HbA1c, selected based on input from people with diabetes, to standard presentation to assess their impact on participants' glycemic control and diabetes-related perceptions. To design the tested formats, we interviewed 25 patients with diabetes and reviewed a range of possible formats, including color-based scales and graphs. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis. Synthesizing interviewees' feedback, we selected two formats, one using a combination of words and colors (Words) and one using a color-coded graph (Graph), for further evaluation. We then randomized adults with poorly controlled diabetes to receive mailed information on their current diabetes control in one of three ways: 1) standard lab report (control), 2) Words format, or 3) Graph format. The primary outcome was HbA1c change at 6 months. Also examined were changes in participants' diabetes-related perceptions and choice of participation incentive. Of the 234 enrolled participants, 76.9% were Black, and their median baseline HbA1c was 9.1% (interquartile range 8.4-10.4). There were [SD 2.1] Graph, p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Participants in the Words arm had an increase in the accuracy of their perceptions of diabetes seriousness (p = 0.04) and in the number of participants reporting a diabetes management goal (p = 0.01). The two patient-informed communication formats did not differentially impact glycemic control among adults with inadequately controlled diabetes. However, a significant proportion of participants in the Words arm had an increase in the accuracy of their perception of diabetes seriousness, a potential mediating factor in positive diabetes-related behavioral changes. With increasing use of patient-facing online portals, thoughtfully designed approaches for visually communicating essential, but poorly understood, information like the HbA1c to patients have the potential to facilitate interpretation and support self-management.

Assessment of Electronic Health Record Search Patterns and Practices by Practitioners in a Large Integrated Health Care System The electronic health record (EHR) is a source of practitioner dissatisfaction in part because of challenges with information retrieval. To improve data accessibility, a better understanding of practitioners' information needs within individual patient records is needed. To assess EHR users' searches using data from a large integrated health care system. This retrospective cross-sectional analysis used EHR search data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated health care delivery system with more than 4.4 million members. Users' EHR search activity data were obtained from April 1, 2018, to May 15, 2019. Search term frequency was grouped by user and practitioner types. Network analyses were performed of co-occurring search terms within a single search episode, and centrality measures for search terms (degree and betweenness centrality) were calculated. A total of 12 313 047 search activities (including 4 328 330 searches and 7 984 717 result views) conducted by 34 735 unique users within 977 160 unique patient EHRs were identified. In aggregate, users searched for 208 374 unique search terms and conducted a median of 4 searches (interquartile range, 1-28 searches). Of all 97 367 active EHR users, 34 735 (35.7%) conducted at least 1 search. However, of all 12 968 active EHR physician users, 9801 (75.6%) conducted at least 1 search, and of all 1908 active pharmacist users, 1402 (73.5%) conducted at least 1 search. The top 3 most commonly searched terms were statin (75 017 searches [1.7%]), colonoscopy (73 545 [1.7%]), and pft (54 990 [1.3%]). However, wide variation in top searches were noted across practitioner groups. Terms searched most often with another term in a single linked search episode included statin, lisinopril, colonoscopy, gabapentin, and aspirin. Although physicians and pharmacists were the most active users of EHR searches, search volume and frequently searched terms varied considerably by and within user role. Further customization of the EHR interface may help leverage users' search content and patterns to improve targeted hysteroscopic catheter: A multi-center study To assess the feasibility of a novel hysteroscopic catheter to collect fallopian tube cytologic samples and to correlate cytologic findings with histopathology. This was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm pilot study. Women undergoing salpingo-oophorectomy for a pelvic mass suspicious for malignancy or for prevention of cancer for BRCA mutation carriers were recruited from 3 gynecologic oncology centers (October 2016-August 2017). Cytologic samples were collected from the fallopian tube using a novel FDA-cleared hysteroscopic catheter and evaluated by a pathologist blinded to surgical or pathologic findings. The correlation between cytologic results and final surgical pathology was assessed. Of the 50 patients enrolled, 42 were eligible. Hysteroscopies were completed in 40 patients with 78 fallopian tubes, of which 65 ostia (83%) were identified. Of these, 61 (72%) were successfully catheterized resulting in 44 (68%) cytology samples adequate for further evaluation: 5 were classified as positive (3 neoplastic and 2 malignant) and 39 as negative (34 benign and 5 reactive/atypical). A comparison of cytology results with fallopian tube histopathology showed a concordance rate of 95% (42/44). Of the two samples with discordant results, both had positive cytology but negative tubal pathology, and both were stage I ovarian cancers with malignant ovary histology. Deployment of the device yielded an evaluable cytologic sample in 68% of cases with a high rate of concordance with histopathology. Further evaluation of the device's ability to detect malignancy in high risk populations is Authors: Monitor Use and Alarm Systems Safety: A Toolkit Clinical alarm systems safety is a national healthcare concern in the United States. Physiologic monitors are the medical devices associated with the highest number of false and clinically insignificant alarms, producing alarm fatigue and a challenge to meet the national clinical alarm systems safety goal. Modern physiologic monitors are high-tech complex devices with multimeasurement modalities and high sensitivity for alarms. This complexity hinders safe operation of the monitors by nurses and appropriate management of associated alarms. Nurses need to integrate cognitive knowledge, psychomotor skills, and critical thinking to safely operate the monitors and support clinical decisions. Limited resources are available to support clinical education for nurses on physiologic monitor use and alarm management. This toolkit presents an educational framework for physiologic monitor use and alarm safety guided by adult learning principles. The components of the program are (1) knowledge, skills, and attitude of physiologic monitor use; (2) scenario-based learning model to support the knowledge, skills, and attitude necessary for safe monitor use; and (3) a framework for evaluating the educational program. Education should be ongoing and customized per facility to ensure safe use of complex technology and to decrease alarm fatigue, the leading cause of alarm-related sentinel events.

Severe Hypoglycemia and Cognitive Function in Older Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: The Study of Longevity in Diabetes (SOLID) In children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), severe hypoglycemia (SH) is associated with poorer cognition, but the association of SH with cognitive function in late life is unknown. Given the increasing life expectancy in people with T1D, understanding the role of SH in brain health is crucial. We examined the association between SH and cognitive function in 718 older adults with T1D from the Study of Longevity in Diabetes (SOLID). Subjects self-reported recent SH (previous 12 months) and lifetime history of SH resulting in inpatient/emergency department utilization. Global and domain-specific cognition (language, executive function, episodic memory, and simple attention) were assessed. The associations of SH with cognitive function and impaired cognition were evaluated via linear and logistic regression models, respectively. Thirty-two percent of participants (mean age 67.2 years) reported recent SH and 50% reported lifetime SH. Compared with those with no SH, subjects with a recent SH history had significantly lower global cognition scores. Domain-specific analyses revealed significantly lower scores on language, executive function, and episodic memory with recent SH exposure and significantly lower executive function with lifetime SH exposure. Recent SH was associated with impaired global cognition (odds ratio [OR] 3.22, 95% CI 1.30, 7.94) and cognitive impairment on the language domain (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.19, 8.29). Among older adults with T1D, recent SH and lifetime SH were associated with worse cognition. Recent SH was associated with impaired global cognition. These findings suggest a deleterious role of SH on the brain health of older patients with T1D and highlight the importance of SH prevention. 2019-12-27.

Implementation of a Hospital Early Warning System at Scale Adults who deteriorate outside the ICU have high mortality. Most rapid response systems (RRSs) have employed manual detection processes that rapid response teams (RRTs) use to identify patients at risk. This project piloted the use of an automated early warning system (EWS), based on a very large database, that provides RRTs with 12 hours lead time to mount a response. Results from a 2-hospital pilot were encouraging, so leadership decided to deploy the Advance Alert Monitor (AAM) program in 19 more hospitals. How can one deploy an RRS using an automated EWS at scale? EWS displays were removed from frontline clinicians' hospital electronic dashboards, and a Virtual Quality Team (VQT) RN was interposed between the EWS and the RRT. VQT RNs monitor the EWS remotely-when alerts are issued, they conduct a preliminary chart review and contact hospital RRT RNs. VQT and RRT RNs review the cases jointly. The RRT RNs then consult with hospitalists regarding clinical rescue and/or palliative care workflows. Subsequently, VQT RNs monitor patient charts, ensuring adherence to RRS practice standards. To enable this process, the project team developed a governance structure, clinical workflows, palliative care workflows, and documentation standards. The AAM Program now functions in 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals. VQT RNs monitor EWS alerts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The AAM Program handles 16,000 alerts per year. Its implementation has resulted in standardization of RRT staffing, clinical rescue workflows, and Saf. 2020 Jan 21.

Association of Mobile Patient Portal Access With Diabetes Medication Adherence and Glycemic Levels Among Adults With Diabetes Online patient portals support self-management, and mobile devices expand portal access, but whether this translates to improvements in diabetes outcomes is unclear. To examine the association of adding mobile patient portal access with diabetes medication adherence and glycemic levels among adults with diabetes. This retrospective cohort study included patients with diabetes treated at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large, integrated health care delivery system, from April 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017. Inclusion criteria were adults with diabetes with an oral diabetes prescription at baseline and no insulin use. Data were analyzed from March 2018 to March 2019. Patient portal access status for each calendar month from April 2015 to December 2017, categorized as never used, used from a computer only, used from a mobile device only, or used from both computer and mobile device. Medication adherence, measured by monthly percentage of days covered (PDC), and glycemic levels, measured by changes in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. The association of portal access with study outcomes was assessed using linear regression with patient-level fixed effects and adjusting for time-changing variables, stratified by baseline HbA1c level. Among 111 463 included patients (mean [SD] age, 63.79 [12.93] years; 59 918 [53.76%] men), the number of patients using the portal from both a computer and mobile device increased over time from 38 371 patients (34.42%) in April 2015 to 57 920 patients (61.71%) in December 2017. Among patients with no prior portal access, adding computer-only portal access was associated with an increase in PDC of 1.16 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.70) percentage points and a change of -0.06 (95% CI, -0.08 to -0.03) percentage points in HbA1c level, and adding both mobile and computer portal access was associated with an increase in PDC of 1.67 (95% CI, 1.10 to 2.23) percentage points and a change of -0.13 (95% CI, -0.16 to -0.10) percentage points in HbA1c level. Among patients with higher baseline HbA1c level (>8.0%), changing from no portal access to both computer and mobile access was associated with an increase in PDC of 5.09 (95% CI, 3.78 to 6.40) percentage points and a change of -0.19 (95% CI, -0.27 to -0.15) percentage points in HbA1c level. These findings suggest that providing patients with computer patient portal access and combining it with mobile patient portal access are associated with significantly improved diabetes medication adherence and glycemic control, with greater benefits among patients with more clinical need. Convenient access to portal self-management tools through a mobile device could significantly improve diabetes management. Authors: Graetz I; Huang Epub 2020-02-05. Pretreatment Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Network Metrics Predict the Strength of the Association Between Node Change and Network Change During Treatment. Network analysis has been increasingly applied in an effort to understand complex interactions among symptoms in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although methods that initially focused on identifying central symptoms in cross-sectional networks have been extended to longitudinal data that can reveal the relative roles of acute symptoms in the emergence of the PTSD syndrome, the association between network metrics and symptom change during treatment have yet to be explored in PTSD. To address this gap, we estimated pretreatment PTSD symptom networks in a sample of patients from a multisite clinical trial for women with full or subthreshold PTSD and substance use. We tested the hypothesis that node metrics calculated in the pretreatment network would be predictive of the strength of the association between a symptom's change and the change in the severity of all other symptoms through the course of treatment. A symptom node's strength and predictability in the pretreatment network were each strongly correlated with the association between that symptom's change and overall change across the symptom network, r(15) = .79, p < .001 and r(15) = .75, p < .001, respectively, whereas a symptom's mean severity at pretreatment was not, r(15) = .27, p = .292. These findings suggest that a node's centrality prior to treatment engagement is a predictor of its association with overall symptom change throughout the treatment process. doi: 10.1002/jts.22379.

Risk of Cardiovascular Events in Statin-Treated Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Dyslipidemia without Prevalent Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease The relationship between achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and risk of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events among patients with diabetes and metabolic dyslipidemia has not been well described. We conducted an observational cohort study of statin-treated adults (ages 21-90 years) with type 2 diabetes without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (as of January 1, 2006) who had metabolic dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides mg/dL [men]). All subjects were members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated health care delivery system. Adjusted multivariable Cox models were specified to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events by achieved LDL-C levels (<50, 50-<70, 70-<100, and ?100 mg/dL). Incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease defined as a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or coronary heart disease death through December 31, 2013. A total of 19,095 individuals met the selection criteria. Mean age was 63.4 years, 53.5% were women, and the mean follow-up was 5.9 years. Unadjusted rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events were not significantly different across specified LDL-C categories. In models adjusted for demographics and clinical characteristics, the risk was significantly lower with decreasing achieved LDL-C levels (P <0.0001 for trend). Relative to achieved LDL-C ?100 mg/dL, mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.82). In a large, contemporary cohort of statin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes and metabolic dyslipidemia without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, lower achieved LDL-C levels were associated with a monotonically lower risk of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events. The benefits of achieving very-low LDL-C (<50 mg/dL) in this population requires further evaluation interventional studies. Authors: Rana Med. 2020 02;133(2):200-206. Epub 2019-07-22. Enhancing panic and smoking reduction treatment with D-Cycloserine: A pilot randomized clinical trial. In this placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, we examined the efficacy of 250 mg d-cycloserine (DCS) for enhancing the effects of cognitive behavior therapy targeting anxiety sensitivity reduction in the context of smoking cessation treatment among adults with a history of panic attacks. We hypothesized that DCS would enhance treatment of our mechanistic targets-anxiety sensitivity and panic and related symptoms-and result in greater smoking abstinence. A total of 53 smokers were randomized to a 7-week integrated treatment and received study medication (DCS or placebo) prior to sessions 3-5; these sessions emphasized interoceptive exposure practice. Nicotine replacement therapy was initiated at session 5 (quit date). We found that DCS augmentation led to greater reductions of one (anxiety sensitivity) of two of our mechanistic targets at early but not late assessments, and that engaging that target predicted better smoking outcomes. However, there was no evidence of group (DCS vs. placebo) differences in smoking cessation success at treatment endpoint or follow-up evaluations. Hence, although we found that DCS can enhance treatment targeting a smoking maintaining factor, additional strategies appear to be needed to significantly affect smoking outcomes.

Goldilocks, the Three Bears and Intensive Care Unit Utilization: Delivering Enough Intensive Care But Not Too Much. A Narrative Review Professional societies have developed recommendations for patient triage protocols, but wide variations in triage patterns for many acute conditions exist among hospitals in the United States. Differences in hospitals' triage patterns can be attributed to factors such as physician behavior, hospital policy and real-time conditions such as intensive care unit capacity. The patient safety concern is that patients evaluated for admission to the intensive care unit during times of high intensive care unit capacity may have adverse outcomes related to delays in care. Because standardization of a national triage policy is not feasible due to differing resources available at each hospital, local guidelines should prevail that take into account hospitals' local resources. The goal would be to better match intensive care unit bed supply with demand. Authors: Myers LC; Escobar G; Liu VX Pulm Ther. 2020 Jan 03. Comparison of Mortality and Major Cardiovascular Events Among Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Using Human vs Analogue Insulins The comparative cardiovascular safety of analogue and human insulins in adults with type 2 diabetes who initiate insulin therapy in usual care settings has not been carefully evaluated using machine learning and other rigorous analytic methods. To examine the association of analogue vs human insulin use with mortality and major cardiovascular events. This retrospective cohort study included 127 600 adults aged 21 to 89 years with type 2 diabetes at 4 health care delivery systems who initiated insulin therapy from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2013. Machine learning and rigorous inference methods with time-varying exposures were used to evaluate associations of continuous exposure to analogue vs human insulins with mortality and major cardiovascular events. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018. On the index date (first insulin dispensing), participants were classified as using analogue insulin with or without human insulin or human insulin only. Overall mortality, mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF) were evaluated. Marginal structural modeling (MSM) with inverse probability weighting was used to compare event-free survival in separate per-protocol analyses. Adjusted and unadjusted hazard ratios and cumulative risk differences were based on logistic MSM parameterizations for counterfactual hazards. Propensity scores were estimated using a data-adaptive approach (machine learning) based on 3 nested covariate adjustment sets. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to address potential residual confounding from unmeasured differences in risk factors across delivery systems. The 127 600 participants (mean [SD] age, 59.4 [12.6] years; 68 index, 32.3 [7.1]) had a median follow-up of 4 quarters (interquartile range, 3-9 quarters) and (2.4%). There were no differences in adjusted hazard ratios for continuous analogue vs human insulin exposure during 10 quarters for overall mortality (1.15; 95% CI, 0.75-1.11). Insulin-naive adults with type 2 diabetes who initiate and continue treatment with human vs analogue insulins had similar observed rates of major cardiovascular events, CVD mortality, and overall mortality.

Predicting the readability of physicians' secure messages to improve health communication using novel linguistic features: Findings from the ECLIPPSE study Low literacy skills impact important aspects of communication, including health-related information exchanges. Unsuccessful communication on the part of physician or patient contributes to lower quality of care, is associated with poorer chronic disease control, jeopardizes patient safety and can lead to unfavorable healthcare utilization patterns. To date, very little research has focused on digital communication between physicians and patients, such as secure messages sent via electronic patient portals. The purpose of the current study is to develop an automated readability formula to better understand what elements of physicians' digital messages make them more or less difficult to understand. The formula is developed using advanced natural language processing (NLP) to predict human ratings of physician text difficulty. The results indicate that NLP indices that capture a diverse set of linguistic features predict the difficulty of physician messages better than classic readability tools such as Flesch Kincaid Grade Level. Our results also provide information about the textual features that best explain text readability. Implications for how the readability formula could provide feedback to physicians to improve digital health communication by promoting linguistic concordance between physician and patient are discussed. Authors: Key: Using the Audit Log to Capture Contextual Factors Affecting Stroke Care Processes High quality patient care through timely, precise and efficacious management depends not only on the clinical presentation of a patient, but the context of the care environment to which they present. Understanding and improving factors that affect streamlined workflow, such as provider or department busyness or experience, are essential to improving these care processes, but have been difficult to measure with traditional approaches and clinical data sources. In this exploratory data analysis, we aim to determine whether such contextual factors can be captured for important clinical processes by taking advantage of non-traditional data sources like EHR audit logs which passively track the electronic behavior of clinical teams. Our results illustrate the potential of defining multiple measures of contextual factors and their correlation with key care processes. We illustrate this using thrombolytic (tPA) treatment for ischemic stroke as an example process, but the measurement approaches can be generalized to multiple scenarios. Authors: Noshad, social determinants of health and social risks among middle-aged and older adults in a Northern California health plan Social determinants of health (SDoHs) and social risks (SRs) have been associated with adverse health and healthcare utilization and racial/ethnic disparities. However, there is limited information about the prevalence of SRs in non-\"safety net\" adult populations and how SRs differ by race/ethnicity, age, education, and income. We analyzed weighted survey data for 16,247 White, 1861 Black, 2895 Latino, 1554 Filipino, and 1289 Chinese adults aged 35 to 79 who responded to the 2011 or 2014/2015 Kaiser Permanente Northern California Member Health Survey. We compared age-standardized prevalence estimates of SDoHs (education, household income, marital status) and SRs (financial worry, cost-related reduced medication use and fruit/vegetable consumption, chronic stress, harassment/discrimination, health-related beliefs) across racial/ethnic groups for ages 35 to 64 and 65 to 79. SDoHs and SRs differed by race/ethnicity and age group, and SRs differed by levels of education and income. In both age groups, Blacks, Latinos, and Filipinos were more likely than Whites to be in the lower income category and be worried about their financial situation. Compared to Whites, cost-related reduced medication use was higher among Blacks, and cost-related reduced fruit/vegetable consumption was higher among Blacks and Latinos. Younger adults were more likely than older adults to experience chronic stress and financial worry. Racial/ethnic disparities in income were observed within similar levels of education. Differences in prevalence of SRs by levels of education and income were wider within than across racial/ethnic groups. In this non-\"safety net\" adult health plan population, Blacks, Latinos, and Filipinos had a higher prevalence of social risks than Whites and Chinese, and prevalence of social risks differed by age group. Our results support the assessment and EHR documentation of SDoHs and social risks and use of this information to understand and address drivers of racial/ethnic disparities in health and healthcare use. Authors: Gordon, Nancy P; Banegas, Association Peripheral Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)/Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) Ratio Time at Risk and Hospital Mortality in Mechanically Ventilated Patients Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation is a leading cause of mortality in the intensive care unit. Although single peripheral blood oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratios of hypoxemia have been evaluated to risk-stratify patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, the utility of longitudinal SpO2/FiO2 ratios is unknown. To assess time-based SpO2/FiO2 ratios 150-SpO2/FiO2 time at risk (SF-TAR)-for predicting mortality in mechanically ventilated patients. Retrospective, observational cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients at 21 community and 2 academic hospitals. Association between the SF-TAR in the first 24 hours of ventilation and mortality was examined using multivariable logistic regression and compared with the worst recorded isolated partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F) ratio. In 28,758 derivation cohort admissions, every 10% increase in SF-TAR was associated with a 24% increase in adjusted odds of hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-1.26); a similar association was observed in validation cohorts. Discrimination for mortality modestly improved with SF-TAR (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.81-0.82) vs the ratio = 0.78; 95% 0.79; 95% CI = 0.79-0.80). The SF-TAR in the first 6 hours offered comparable discrimination for hospital mortality (AUROC = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.79-0.80) to the 24-hour SF-TAR. The SF-TAR can identify ventilated patients at increased risk of death, offering modest improvements compared with single SpO2/FiO2 and P/F ratios. This longitudinal, noninvasive, and broadly generalizable tool may have particular utility for early phenotyping and risk stratification using electronic health record data in ventilated patients.

Sleep Quality and Cognitive Function in Type 1 Diabetes: Findings From the Study of Longevity in Diabetes (SOLID) The objective was to examine the association between sleep quality and global and domain-specific cognitive function among older individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We evaluated 695 individuals with T1D aged 60 years or above who participated in the baseline assessment of the Study of Longevity in Diabetes (SOLID), which captured subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and global and domain-specific (language, executive function, episodic memory, and simple attention) cognitive function. Multivariable linear regressions estimated the associations between sleep quality quartiles and overall and domain-specific cognitive function adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, depressive symptoms, and severe hypoglycemic episodes. Sensitivity analyses examined the associations between aspects of sleep quality and global cognitive function. The worst sleep quality quartile was associated with lower global cognition (=-0.08; 95% -0.30, -0.03) compared with the best quartile of sleep quality adjusting for demographics and comorbidities. Sleep quality was not associated with language, episodic memory, or simple attention. Sleep medications and daytime dysfunction were most strongly associated with global cognition. Our results suggest that sleep quality may be a modifiable risk factor for global cognitive function and executive function among elderly individuals with 2020 Jan-Mar;34(1):18-24. ICU Utilization for Patients With Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Receiving Noninvasive Ventilation. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease could safely receive noninvasive ventilation outside of the ICU.DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.SETTING: Twelve states with ICU utilization flag from the State Inpatient Database from 2014.PATIENTS: Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old with primary diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and secondary diagnosis of respiratory failure who received noninvasive ventilation.INTERVENTIONS: None.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multilevel logistic regression models were used to obtain hospital-level ICU utilization rates. We risk-adjusted using both patient/hospital characteristics. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; secondary outcomes were invasive monitoring (arterial/central catheters), hospital length of stay, and cost. We examined 5,081 hospitalizations from 424 hospitals with ICU utilization ranging from 0.05 to 0.98. The overall median in-hospital mortality was 2.62% (interquartile range, 1.72-3.88%). ICU utilization was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality ( = 0.01; p = 0.05) or length of stay ( = 0.18; p = 0.41), which was confirmed by Spearman correlation ( = 0.06; p = 0.20 and = 0.02; p = 0.64, respectively). However, lower ICU utilization was associated with lower rates of invasive monitor placement by linear regression ( = 0.05; p < 0.001) and Spearman correlation ( = 0.28; p < 0.001). Lower ICU utilization was also associated with significantly lower cost by linear regression ( = 14.91; p = 0.02) but not by Spearman correlation ( = 0.09; p = 0.07).CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variability in the rate of ICU utilization for noninvasive ventilation across hospitals. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients receiving noninvasive ventilation had similar in-hospital mortality across the ICU utilization spectrum but a lower rate of receiving invasive monitors and probably lower cost when treated in lower ICU-utilizing hospitals. Although the results suggest that noninvasive ventilation can be delivered safely outside of the ICU, we advocate for hospital-specific risk assessment if a hospital were considering changing its noninvasive ventilation delivery policy.

The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program and Readmissions for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, 2006-2015. RATIONALE: In October 2012, the initial phase of the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) imposed financial penalties on hospitals with higher than expected risk-adjusted 30-day readmission rates for Medicare beneficiaries with congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and pneumonia. We hypothesized that these penalties may also be associated with decreased readmissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the general population before COPD became a target condition (October 2014).OBJECTIVE: To determine if implementation of the initial financial penalties for other conditions was associated with a decrease in hospital readmissions for COPD.METHODS: We used population-level data to examine patients readmitted for any reason or for COPD within 30 days after an initial hospitalization for COPD. The data source was seven states in the State Inpatient Database. The pre-implementation period included calendar years 2006-2012. The post-implementation period included 2013-2015. Using interrupted time series, the level change was examined, which reflected the difference between the expected and actual readmission rates in 2013. The difference in slopes between the pre- and post-implementation periods was also examined.RESULTS: We identified 805,764 hospitalizations for COPD from 904 hospitals. Overall, 26% of patients had primary insurance other than Medicare. After the intervention, patients had lower rates of all-cause 30-day readmissions (level change -0.93%, 95% CI -1.44, which driven by early readmissions (0-7 days). The post-implementation slope became positive; the difference in slopes was 0.39% (95% CI 0.28, 0.50, PCONCLUSIONS: In patients with COPD and any insurance status, there was an association between the initial phase of the HRRP and a decrease in both all-cause and COPD-related readmissions even before COPD became a target diagnosis. The large amount of money at risk to hospitals likely resulted in broad behavioral change. Future research is needed to test which levers can effectively reduce readmission rates for Thoracic Society. 2019 Dec 20;():. Epub 2019-12-20. An Examination of Medical Malpractice Claims Involving Physician Trainees. PURPOSE: To identify patient-, provider- and claim-related factors of medical malpractice claims in which physician trainees were directly involved in the harm events.METHOD: The authors performed a case-control study using medical malpractice claims closed between 2012-2016 and contributed to the Comparative Benchmarking System database by teaching hospitals. Using the service extender flag, they classified claims as cases if physician trainees were directly involved in the harm events. They classified claims as controls if they were from the same facilities but trainees were not directly involved in the harm events. They performed multivariable regression with predictor variables being patient and provider characteristics. The outcome was physician trainee involvement in harm events.RESULTS: From the original pool of 30,973 claims, there were 581 cases and 2,610 controls. The majority of cases involved residents (471, 81%). Cases had a statistically significant higher rate of having a trainee named as defendants than controls (184, 32% vs 233, 9%, P < .001). The most common final diagnosis for cases was puncture or laceration during surgery (62, 11%). Inadequate supervision was a contributing factor in 140 (24%) cases overall, with the majority (104, 74%) of these claims being procedure-related. Multivariable regression analysis revealed trainees were most likely to be involved in harm events in specialties such as oral surgery/dentistry and obstetrics/gynecology (odds ratio [OR] = 7.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.93, 21.83 and OR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.24, 2.66), when performing procedures (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.27, 1.96), or when delivering care in the emergency room (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.43, 1.91).CONCLUSIONS: Among claims involving physician trainees, procedures were common and often associated with inadequate supervision. Training directors of procedural specialties can use this information to improve resident supervision policies. The goal is to reduce the likelihood of future events.

Changing Results-Engage and Activate to Enhance Wellness: A Randomized Clinical Trial to Improve Cardiovascular Risk Management Background Despite the success of current cardiovascular disease (CVD) management programs, many patients do not achieve optimal control of CVD-related risk factors. New strategies are needed to better activate and engage these patients. Methods and Results We conducted a parallel, 2-arm, randomized controlled trial, CREATE Wellness (Changing Results-Engage and Activate to Enhance Wellness) from February 2015 to September 2017 with 12-month follow-up to September 2018. Eligible participants had 1 uncontrolled CVD risk factors (hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus) for at least 2 years before study enrollment. The control group (n=315) received usual care within an existing CVD population-based disease management program. The intervention group (n=332) received usual care plus a group-based behavioral intervention focused on patient activation and engagement. Study outcomes included patient activation and patient-centered care processes (6 months) and healthcare system engagement, medication adherence, and control of CVD risk factors (12 months). Compared with the control group at follow-up, the intervention group had greater improvement in patient activation (adjusted mean difference=2.8, P=0.01), patient-centered care (adjusted mean difference=0.19, P=0.003), and 2 out of 3 measures of healthcare system engagement (eg, secure messages exchanged with a population health manager; adjusted incidence rate ratio=1.7, P=0.01). Intervention and control arms did not differ on improvement in 1-year CVD risk factor control. Conclusions Further work is needed to more effectively connect increased patient activation and engagement to downstream changes in risk factor control.

Primary Care Physicians' Experiences With and Strategies for Managing Electronic Messages The increasing use of electronic communications has enhanced access to physicians for patients and clinical staff. Primary care physicians (PCPs) have anecdotally identified electronic inbox management as a new source of work-related stress. To describe PCPs' experiences managing their electronic inboxes and to characterize the array of management strategies developed by individual physicians and practice groups. This qualitative study was conducted in 8 medical centers of a large group practice with more than 4 million patients in diverse settings and a mature electronic health record. The group encourages patients to use portal secure messaging to enhance access to their physicians and the care experience. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 24 internists and family medicine physicians identified via snowball sampling. Interviews were conducted July through November 2018. Data analysis was conducted between November 2018 and April 2019. Audio recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis to identify major themes and subthemes. The 24 participants (12 women [50.0%]; mean [SD] age, 45.5 [6.5] years), including 9 department chiefs and 15 PCPs, had a mean (SD) of 16.8 (7.8) years since medical school graduation. Participants described substantial changes in medical practice due to electronic communication, including perceived patient expectations to receive rapid responses to portal secure messages. They described portal secure messaging as useful for building relationships with patients, but also reported that electronic message management has created new stressors, including erosion of work-life boundaries and anxiety associated with unlimited inbox volume. Individual PCPs used a diverse array of strategies, including multitasking during and outside work and delegating to medical assistants. Chiefs described group-level strategies, including reserving clinic time for inbox management, coverage systems for vacation and sick days, physician-to-physician training, and interdisciplinary teams to share messaging work. Individual physicians and local practice groups have developed a wide array of strategies for electronic inbox management. The volume of electronic messages and PCPs' perceptions that patients expect rapid responses have created new stressors in primary care practice. Medical groups and health systems can support PCPs by facilitating knowledge transfer among physicians about inbox management strategies and further developing team structures for inbox coverage.

Multiyear Rehospitalization Rates and Hospital Outcomes in an Integrated Health Care System Since the introduction of the rehospitalization rate as a quality measure, multiple changes have taken place in the US health care delivery system. Interpreting rehospitalization rates without taking a global view of these changes and new data elements from comprehensive electronic medical records yields a limited assessment of the quality of care. To examine hospitalization outcomes from a broad perspective, including the implications of numerator and denominator definitions, all adult patients with all diagnoses, and detailed clinical data. This cohort study obtained data from 21 hospitals in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated health care delivery system that serves patients with Medicare Advantage plans, Medicaid, and/or Kaiser Foundation Health Plan. The KPNC electronic medical record system was used to capture hospitalization data for adult patients who were 18 years of age or older; discharged from June 1, 2010, through December 31, 2017; and hospitalized for reasons other than childbirth. Hospital stays for transferred patients were linked using public and internal sources. Hospitalization type (inpatient, for observation only), comorbidity burden, acute physiology score, and care directives. Mortality (inpatient, 30-day, and 30-day postdischarge), nonelective rehospitalization, and discharge disposition (home, home with home health assistance, regular skilled nursing facility, or custodial skilled nursing facility). In total, 1 384 025 hospitalizations were identified, of which 1 155 034 (83.5%) were inpatient and 228 991 (16.5%) were for observation only. These hospitalizations involved 679 831 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.4 female [53.3%]). of for-observation-only hospitalizations increased from 16 497 (9.4%) in the first year of the study to 120 215 (20.5%) in the last period of the study, whereas inpatient hospitalizations with length of stay less than 24 hours decreased by 33% (from 12 008 [6.9%] to 27 108 [4.6%]). Illness burden measured using administrative data or acute physiology score increased significantly. The proportion of patients with a Comorbidity Point Score of 65 or higher increased from 20.5% (range across hospitals, 18.4%-26.4%) to 28.8% (range, 22.3%-33.0%), as did the proportion with a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 4 or higher, which increased from 28.8% (range, 24.6%-35.0%) to 38.4% (range, 31.9%-43.4%). The proportion of patients at or near critical illness (Laboratory-based Acute Physiology Score [LAPS2] 110) increased by 21.4% (10.3% across hospitals, 7.4%-14.7%] to 12.5% [range across hospitals, 8.3%-16.6%]; P < .001), reflecting a steady increase of 0.07 (95% CI, 0.04-0.10) LAPS2 points per month. Unadjusted inpatient mortality in the first year of the study was 2.78% and in the last year was 2.71%; the corresponding numbers for 30-day mortality were 5.88% and 6.15%, for 30-day postdischarge mortality were 3.94% and for nonelective rehospitalization were 12.00% and 12.81%, respectively. All outcomes improved after risk adjustment. Compared with the first month, the final observed to expected ratio was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.84) for inpatient 30-day postdischarge mortality. The proportion of nonelective rehospitalizations meeting public reporting criteria decreased substantially over the study period (from 58.0% in 2010-2011 to 45.2% in 2017); most of this decrease was associated with the exclusion of observation stays. This study found that in this integrated system, the hospitalization rate decreased and risk-adjusted hospital outcomes improved steadily over the 7.5-year study period despite worsening case mix. The comprehensive results suggest that future assessments of care quality should consider the implications of numerator and denominator definitions, display multiple metrics concurrently, and include all hospitalization types and detailed data.

Use and Discontinuation of Insulin Treatment Among Adults Aged 75 to 79 Years With Type 2 Diabetes Among older individuals with type 2 diabetes, those with poor health have greater risk and derive less benefit from tight glycemic control with insulin. To examine whether insulin treatment is used less frequently and discontinued more often among older individuals with poor health compared with those in good health. This longitudinal cohort study included 21 531 individuals with type 2 diabetes followed for up to 4 years starting at age 75 years. Electronic health record data from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry was collected to characterize insulin treatment and glycemic control over time. Data were collected from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2017, and analyzed from February 2, 2018, through June 30, 2019. Health status was defined as good (<2 comorbid conditions or 2 comorbidities but physically active), intermediate (>2 comorbidities or 2 comorbidities and no self-reported weekly exercise), or poor (having end-stage pulmonary, cardiac, or renal disease; diagnosis of dementia; or metastatic cancer). Insulin use prevalence at age 75 years and discontinuation among insulin users over the next 4 years (or 6 months prior to death if <4 years). Of 21 531 patients, 10 396 (48.3%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 75 (0) years. Nearly one-fifth of 75-year-olds (4076 [18.9%]) used insulin. Prevalence and adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) of insulin use at age 75 years were higher in individuals with poor health (29.4%; aRR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.87-2.20; P < .01) and intermediate health (27.5%; aRR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.74-1.97; P < .01) relative good health (10.5% [reference]). One-third (1335 of 4076 [32.7%]) of insulin users at age 75 years discontinued insulin within 4 years of cohort entry (and at least 6 months prior to death). Likelihood of continued insulin use was higher among individuals in poor health (aRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.27-1.67; P < .01) and intermediate health (aRR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.30; P < .01) compared with good health (reference). These same prevalence and discontinuation patterns were present in the subset with tight glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c <7.0%). In older individuals with type 2 diabetes, insulin use was most prevalent among those in poor health, whereas subsequent insulin discontinuation after age 75 years was most likely in healthier patients. Changes are needed in current practice to better align with guidelines that recommend reducing treatment intensity as health status declines. Authors: 12 01;179(12):1633-1641. Assessing clinical heterogeneity in sepsis through treatment patterns and machine learning To use unsupervised topic modeling to evaluate heterogeneity in sepsis treatment patterns contained within granular data of electronic health records. A multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 29 253 hospitalized adult sepsis patients between 2010 and 2013 in Northern California. We applied an unsupervised machine learning method, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to the orders, medications, and procedures recorded in the electronic health record within the first 24 hours of each patient's hospitalization to uncover empiric treatment topics across the cohort and to develop computable clinical signatures for each patient based on proportions of these topics. We evaluated how these topics correlated with common sepsis treatment and outcome metrics including inpatient mortality, time to first antibiotic, and fluids given within 24 hours. Mean age was 70 \u00b1 17 years with hospital mortality of 9.6%. We empirically identified 42 clinically recognizable treatment topics (eg, pneumonia, cellulitis, wound care, shock). Only 43.1% of hospitalizations had a single dominant topic, and a small minority (7.3%) had a single topic comprising at least 80% of their overall clinical signature. Across the entire sepsis cohort, clinical signatures were highly variable. Heterogeneity in sepsis is a major barrier to improving targeted treatments, yet existing approaches to characterizing clinical heterogeneity are narrowly defined. A machine learning approach captured substantial patient- and population-level heterogeneity in treatment during early sepsis hospitalization. Using topic modeling based on treatment patterns may enable more precise clinical characterization in sepsis and better understanding of variability in sepsis presentation and outcomes.

The number needed to benefit: estimating the value of predictive analytics in healthcare Predictive analytics in health care has generated increasing enthusiasm recently, as reflected in a rapidly growing body of predictive models reported in literature and in real-time embedded models using electronic health record data. However, estimating the benefit of applying any single model to a specific clinical problem remains challenging today. Developing a shared framework for estimating model value is therefore critical to facilitate the effective, safe, and sustainable use of predictive tools into the future. We highlight key concepts within the prediction-action dyad that together are expected to impact model benefit. These include factors relevant to model prediction (including the number needed to screen) as well as those relevant to the subsequent action (number needed to treat). In the simplest terms, a number needed to benefit contextualizes the numbers needed to screen and treat, offering an opportunity to estimate the value of a clinical predictive model in action.

Postoperative Opioid Use Before and After Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Program Implementation Authors: Liu VX; Eaton Asian-American subgroups masks meaningful differences in health and health risks among Asian ethnicities: an electronic health record based cohort study Few large cohort studies have examined the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), obesity, and smoking among middle-aged and older adults in the major Asian-American ethnic groups and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders (PIs). The aim of this study was to evaluate how prevalence of these conditions and risk factors differs across Asian-American and PI ethnic groups and compares with an aggregated All Asian-American racial group. This study used a cohort of 1.4 million adults aged 45 to 84 who were Kaiser Permanente Northern California health plan members during 2016. The cohort included approximately 274,910 Asian-Americans (Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Southeast Asian, South Asian, other), 8450 PIs, 795,080 non-Hispanic whites, 107,200 blacks, and 210,050 Latinos. We used electronic health record data to produce age-standardized prevalence estimates of DM, HTN, CAD, obesity (using standard and Asian thresholds), and smoking for men and women in all racial/ethnic subgroups and compared these subgroups to an aggregated All Asian-American racial group and to whites, blacks, and Latinos. We found large differences in health burden across Asian-American ethnic subgroups. For both sexes, there were 16 and > 22 percentage point differences between the lowest and highest prevalence of DM and HTN, respectively. Obesity prevalence among Asian subgroups (based on an Asian BMI 27.5 kg/m2 threshold) ranged from 14 to 39% among women and 21 to 45% among men. Prevalence of smoking ranged from 1 to 4% among women and 5 to 14% among men. Across all conditions and risk factors, prevalence estimates for Asian-American and PI ethnic groups significantly differed from those for the All Asian-American group. In general, Filipinos and PIs had greater health burden than All Asians, with prevalence estimates approaching those of blacks. In a population of middle-aged and older adult Northern California health plan members, we found substantive differences in prevalence of chronic cardiovascular conditions, obesity, and smoking across Asian-American ethnic groups and between Asian-American ethnic groups and an aggregated All Asian racial group. Our study confirms that reporting statistics for an aggregated Asian-American racial group masks meaningful differences in Asian-American ethnic group health.

This paper explores Latinx adolescents' perceptions of power dynamics with authority around them. We seek to inform how community-based professionals engage with and seek to understand members of this population. We conducted a critical discourse analysis of data collected during a community action photovoice project with 13 Latinx adolescents living in a metropolitan region of the southeastern United States. Participants felt they were under greater surveillance scrutiny by authority figures in social and academic spaces than their non-Latino peers. They discussed ways their movements were at times constrained because others presumed they were deviant, and how that affected their identity development. Judgments and assumptions held by both powerful adults and oppressed groups alike serve to reinscribe social stratification that places Latinx adolescents at a power disadvantage relative to their white peers. These experiences and understandings of power relations shape the circuitous racial dispossession of youth. Thatcher, Kari K; Chapman, Mimi M Journal of community psychology. 2019 Nov 09;():.

Comorbid Diabetes and Severe Mental Illness: Outcomes in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System Diabetes prevalence is twice as high among people with severe mental illness (SMI) when compared to the general population. Despite high prevalence, care outcomes are not well understood. To compare diabetes health outcomes received by people with and without comorbid SMI, and to understand demographic factors associated with poor diabetes control among those with SMI. Retrospective cohort study PARTICIPANTS: 269,243 adults with diabetes MAIN MEASURES: Primary outcomes included optimal glycemic control (A1c < 7) or poor diabetes control (A1c > 9) in 2014. Secondary outcomes included control of other cardiometabolic risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking) and recommended diabetes monitoring. Among this cohort, people with SMI (N = 4,399), compared to those without SMI (N = 264,844), were more likely to have optimal glycemic control, adjusting for various covariates (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.25, 95% CI 1.21-1.28, p < .001) and less likely to have poor control (aRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.98, p = 0.012). Better blood pressure and lipid control was more prevalent among people with SMI when compared to those without SMI (aRR 1.03; 95% 1.02-1.05, p 95% CI 1.00-1.05, p = 0.044, respectively). No differences were observed in recommended A1c or LDL testing, but people with SMI were more likely to have blood pressure checked (aRR 1.02, 95% CI 1.02-1.03, p < .001) and less likely to receive retinopathy screening (aRR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.91, p < .001) than those without SMI. Among people with diabetes and comorbid SMI, younger adults and Hispanics were more likely to have poor diabetes control. Adults with diabetes and comorbid SMI had better cardiometabolic control than people with diabetes who did not have SMI, despite lower rates of retinopathy screening. Among those with comorbid SMI, younger adults and Hispanics were more vulnerable to J Gen Intern Med. 2019 Nov 08. Proton Pump Inhibitors, H2 Blocker Use, and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Children Evidence suggests use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 blockers may provoke disease flares in individuals with established inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, there are no studies investigating the relationship of these medications with risk of developing pediatric IBD. The hypothesis was that use of acid suppression therapy in children might be associated with development of pediatric IBD. This was a nested case-control study of 285 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members, age 21 years diagnosed with IBD from 1996 to 2016. Four controls without IBD were matched to each case on age, race, and membership status at the case's index date. Disease risk scores (DRS) were computed for each subject. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by using conditional logistic regression models adjusted for DRS. The children's mean age was 15.1 \u00b1 2.6 years and 49.5% were female. Six cases (n = 3 Crohn's disease [CD], n = 3 ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 6 controls were prescribed PPIs and 10 cases (n = 7 CD, n = 3 UC) and 28 controls were prescribed H2 blockers. The OR for the association of at least 1 PPI or H2 blocker prescription with subsequent IBD was 3.6 (95% CI, 1.1-11.7) for PPIs and 1.6 (95% CI, 0.7-3.7) for H2 blockers. Early-life PPI use appears to be associated with subsequent IBD risk. These findings have implications for clinical treatment of children with gastrointestinal symptoms and warrant further investigation in a larger Pharmacol Ther. 2019 Nov-Dec;24(6):489-496. Secure Messaging with Physicians by Proxies for Patients with Diabetes: Findings from the ECLIPPSE Study Little is known about patients who have caregiver proxies communicate with healthcare providers via portal secure messaging (SM). Since proxy portal use is often informal (e.g., sharing patient accounts), novel methods are needed to estimate the prevalence of proxy-authored SMs. (1) Develop an algorithm to identify proxy-authored SMs, (2) apply this algorithm to estimate predicted proxy SM (PPSM) prevalence among patients with diabetes, and (3) explore patient characteristics associated with having PPSMs. Retrospective cohort study. We examined 9856 patients from Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) who sent ??1 English-language SM to their primary care physician between July 1, 2006, and Dec. 31, 2015. Using computational linguistics, we developed ProxyID, an algorithm that identifies phrases frequently found in registered proxy SMs. ProxyID was validated against blinded expert categorization of proxy status among an SM sample, then applied to identify PPSM prevalence across patients. We examined patients' sociodemographic and registered proxy-authored ProxyID demonstrated moderate agreement with expert classification (??=?0.58); 45.7% of patients had PPSMs (40.2% low and 5.5% high). Patients with high percent PPSMs were older than those with low percent and no PPSMs (66.5 vs 57.4 vs 56.2 years, p?0.001) had higher rates of limited English proficiency (16.1% vs 3.2% vs 3.5%, p?0.05), and comorbidities (Charlson index 3.78 vs 2.35 vs 2.18, p?0.001). Among patients with diabetes, informal proxy SM use is more common than registered use and prevalent among socially and medically vulnerable patients. Future research should explore whether proxy portal use improves patient and/or caregiver outcomes and consider policies that integrate caregivers in J Gen Intern Med. 2019 11;34(11):2490-2496.

Text message alerts to emergency physicians identifying potential study candidates increase clinical trial enrollment Prospective enrollment of research subjects in the fast-paced emergency department (ED) is challenging. We sought to develop a software application to increase real-time clinical trial enrollment during an ED visit. The Prospective Intelligence System for Clinical Emergency Services (PISCES) scans the electronic health record during ED encounters for preselected clinical characteristics of potentially eligible study participants and notifies the treating physician via mobile phone text alerts. PISCES alerts began 3 months into a cluster randomized trial of an electronic health record-based risk stratification tool for pediatric abdominal pain in 11 Northern California EDs. We compared aggregate enrollment before (2577 eligible patients, October 2016 to December 2016) and after (12 049 eligible patients, January 2017 to January 2018) PISCES implementation. Enrollment increased from 10.8% to 21.1% following PISCES implementations (P?.001). PISCES significantly increased study enrollment and can serve as a valuable tool to assist prospective research enrollment in the ED. Authors: Med Inform Assoc. 2019 11 01;26(11):1360-1363. Detection of early stage ovarian cancer in a large community cohort Although detecting ovarian cancer at early stage is a highly meaningful clinical goal, no studies have evaluated early stage disease presentation in a large community-based population and how it differs from that of late stage disease. Electronic medical records were evaluated for women diagnosed with ovarian or fallopian tube cancer in 2016 and 2017 to identify the first imaging study to detect disease. Women being followed prior to diagnosis for known genetic risk from BRCA or other mutation were excluded. The visit in which the imaging test was ordered and related encounters were reviewed to determine the indication for imaging. Patient characteristics, presenting symptoms and duration, and modality of first abnormal imaging were compared for early vs late stage ovarian cancer and by provider specialty. Of 540 women with ovarian cancer, 190 (35%) were diagnosed with early stage disease, of whom 141 (74%) were symptomatic, with 45% of women presenting to internists, 33% to gynecologists, and 20% to emergency medicine physicians. Pelvic ultrasonography detected only 23% of late stage cases whereas pelvic ultrasonography and abdominal pelvic computed tomography (CT) each detected 47% of early stage cases. While abdominal pain and bloating were common to both women with early and late stage cancer, women with early stage disease were younger (58 vs 64 years, P < .0001), more likely to present to gynecologists (33% vs 15%, P < .001) and complained more often of a palpable mass (17% vs 6%, P < .0001) or postmenopausal bleeding (11% vs 5%, P < .001). Excluding women with genetic predisposition to ovarian cancer known prior to diagnosis, approximately three out of four cases of early stage ovarian cancer are detected as the result of evaluation of symptoms and one in four cases are detected incidentally. Abdominal pelvic CT and pelvic ultrasonography each detect an equal proportion of early stage cases. In contrast to late stage presentation, women diagnosed with early stage disease present more often with complaints of a palpable mass or postmenopausal bleeding, particularly to gynecologists.

Preclinical and clinical data have shown that D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist at the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor complex, augments the retention of fear extinction in animals and the therapeutic learning from exposure therapy in humans. However, studies with non-clinical human samples in de novo fear conditioning paradigms have demonstrated minimal to no benefit of DCS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of DCS on the retention of extinction learning following de novo fear conditioning in a clinical sample. Eighty-one patients with social anxiety disorder were recruited and underwent a previously validated de novo fear conditioning and extinction paradigm over the course of three days. Of those, only 43 (53%) provided analyzable data. During conditioning on Day 1, participants viewed images of differently colored lamps, two of which were followed by with electric shock (CS+) and a third which was not (CS-). On Day 2, participants were randomly assigned to receive either 50 mg DCS or placebo, administered in a double-blind manner 1 hour prior to extinction training with a single CS+ in a distinct context. Day 3 consisted of tests of extinction recall and renewal. The primary outcome was skin conductance response to conditioned stimuli, and shock expectancy ratings were examined as a secondary outcome. Results showed greater skin conductance and expectancy ratings in response to the CS+ compared to CS- at the end of conditioning. As expected, this difference was no longer present at the end of extinction training, but returned at early recall and renewal phases on Day 3, showing evidence of return of fear. In contrast to hypotheses, DCS had no moderating influence on skin conductance response or expectancy of shock during recall or renewal phases. We did not find evidence of an effect of DCS on the retention of extinction learning in humans in this fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Authors: clinical impact of CYP2C9 pharmacogenetic variation on phenytoin prescribing practice and patient response in an integrated health system To assess the impact of CYP2C9 variation on phenytoin patient response and clinician prescribing practice where genotype was unknown during treatment. A retrospective analysis of Resource on Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging cohort participants who filled a phenytoin prescription between 1996 and 2017. We used laboratory test results, medication dispensing records, and medical notes to identify associations of CYP2C9 genotype with phenytoin blood concentration, neurologic side effects, and medication dispensing patterns reflecting clinician prescribing practice and patient response. Among 993 participants, we identified 69% extensive, 20% high-intermediate, P < effects (hazard ratio: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.24-4.64; P < 0.01). Decreased function CYP2C9 genotypes were associated with medication dispensing patterns indicating dose decrease, use of alternative anticonvulsants, and worse adherence, although these associations varied by treatment indication for phenytoin. CYP2C9 variation was associated with clinically meaningful differences in clinician prescribing practice and patient response, with potential implications for healthcare utilization and treatment efficacy.

Portal Use Among Patients With Chronic Conditions: Patient-reported Care Experiences Personal health records offer patients access to view their own health information and to manage their care online through secure patient portal tools. Little is known about the patient-reported experience in using health portals to manage chronic conditions. In a patient-centered research study, we examined how using portal tools affects patient health care experiences among patients with chronic conditions. We also examined barriers among nonportal users. A cross-sectional patient survey. Patients with a chronic condition in an integrated delivery system offering a patient portal. Respondents reported barriers, preferences, and experiences in using the patient portal, and whether using the portal changed their overall health. Among all the 1824 respondents (70% response rate), portal nonusers reported preferring in-person health care (54%) or experiencing internet access barriers (41%). Portal users reported that using the portal was convenient (90%), the information available was useful (92%), and that it integrated well with other health care (92%). Among users, 31% reported that using the portal had improved their overall health. After adjustment, patients were significantly more likely to report that portal use improved their health if they had also reported convenience, information usefulness, or integration with other care (P<0.05). Reassuringly, patient-reported impacts on overall health did not vary by patient characteristics (including age, race, sex, education, income, complex conditions). Patients with chronic conditions using the portal reported convenience, information usefulness, and integration of the patient portal with their health care; these may act as potential pathways improving Med Care. 2019 10;57(10):809-814. Validation of the Pediatric Appendicitis Risk Calculator (pARC) in a Community Emergency Department Setting The pediatric Appendicitis Risk Calculator (pARC) is a validated clinical tool for assessing a child's probability of appendicitis. Our objective was to assess the performance of the pARC in community emergency departments (EDs) and to compare its performance with that of the Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS). We conducted a prospective validation study from October 1, 2016, to April 30, 2018, in 11 community EDs serving general populations. Patients aged 5 to 20.9 years and with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and less than or equal to 5 days of right-sided or diffuse abdominal pain were eligible for study enrollment. Our primary outcome was the presence or absence of appendicitis within 7 days of the index visit. We reported performance characteristics and secondary outcomes by pARC risk strata and compared the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves of the PAS and pARC. We enrolled 2,089 patients with a mean age of 12.4 years, 46% of whom were male patients. Appendicitis was confirmed in 353 patients (16.9%), of whom 55 (15.6%) had perforated appendixes. Fifty-four percent of patients had very low (<5%) or low (5% to 14%) predicted risk, 43% had intermediate risk (15% to 84%), and 4% had high risk (85%). In the very-low- and low-risk groups, 1.4% and 3.0% of patients had appendicitis, respectively. The area under the ROC curve was 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.87 to 0.92) for the with 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.82) for the PAS. The pARC accurately assessed appendicitis risk for children aged 5 years and older in community EDs and the pARC outperformed the PAS.

Epub (HCQ) is a cornerstone to managing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), yet adherence to medication is poor. We sought to measure the association of adherence with 5 \"dimensions of adherence\" as articulated by the World Health Organization for chronic conditions: the patient's socioeconomic status, and patient-, condition-, therapy-, and healthcare system-related factors. Our longterm goal is to generate evidence to design effective interventions to increase adherence. The retrospective cohort study included Kaiser Permanente Northern California patients 18 years old during 2006-2014, with SLE and 2 consecutive prescriptions for HCQ. Adherence was calculated from the medication possession ratio and dichotomized as < 80% versus 80%. Predictor variables were obtained from the electronic medical record and census data. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate adjusted OR and 95% CI. The study included 1956 patients. Only 58% of patients had adherence 80%. In adjusted analyses, socioeconomic variables did not predict adherence. Increasing age (65-89 yrs compared with 39 yrs: OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.07-1.93), white race (p < 0.05), and the number of rheumatology visits in the year before baseline ( 3 compared with 0 or 1: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.18-1.83) were positively associated with adherence. The rheumatologist and medical center providing care were not associated with adherence. At our setting, as in other settings, about half of patients with SLE were not adherent to HCQ therapy. Differences in adherence by race/ethnicity suggest the possibility of using tailored interventions to increase adherence. Qualitative research is needed to elucidate patient preferences for adherence support. Effect of donor, component and recipient characteristics on hemoglobin increments following red blood cell transfusion Significant research has focused individually on blood donors, product preparation and storage, and optimal transfusion practice. To better understand the interplay between these factors on measures of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion efficacy, we conducted a linked analysis of blood donor and component data with patients who received single-unit RBC transfusions between 2008 and 2016. Hemoglobin levels before and after RBC transfusions and at 24- and 48-hour intervals after transfusion were analyzed. Generalized estimating equation linear regression models were fit to examine hemoglobin increments after RBC transfusion adjusting for donor and recipient demographic characteristics, collection method, additive solution, gamma irradiation, and storage duration. We linked data on 23?194 transfusion recipients who received one or more single-unit RBC transfusions (n = 38?019 units) to donor demographic and component characteristics. Donor and recipient sex, Rh-D status, collection method, gamma irradiation, recipient age and body mass index, and pretransfusion hemoglobin levels were significant predictors of hemoglobin increments in univariate and multivariable analyses (P < .01). For hemoglobin increments 24 hours after transfusion, the coefficient of determination for the generalized estimating equation models was 0.25, with an estimated correlation between actual and predicted values of 0.5. Collectively, blood donor demographic characteristics, collection and processing methods, and recipient characteristics accounted for significant variation in hemoglobin increments related to RBC transfusion. Multivariable modeling allows the prediction of changes in hemoglobin using donor-, component-, and patient-level characteristics. Accounting for these factors will be critical for future analyses of donor and component factors, including genetic polymorphisms, on posttransfusion increments and other patient outcomes. Simple Adnexal Cysts: SRU Consensus Conference Follow-up and Reporting. This multidisciplinary consensus update aligns prior Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (SRU) guidelines on simple adnexal cysts with recent large studies showing exceptionally low risk of cancer associated with simple adnexal cysts. Most small simple cysts do not require follow-up. For larger simple cysts or less well-characterized cysts, follow-up or second opinion US help to ensure that solid elements are not missed and are also useful for assessing growth of benign tumors. In postmenopausal women, reporting of simple cysts greater than 1 cm should be done to document their presence in the medical record, but such findings are common and follow-up is recommended only for simple cysts greater than 3-5 cm, with the higher 5-cm threshold reserved for simple cysts with excellent imaging characterization and documentation. For simple cysts in premenopausal women, these thresholds are 3 cm for reporting and greater than 5-7 cm for follow-up imaging. If a cyst is at least 10%-15% smaller at any time, then further follow-up is unnecessary. Stable simple cysts at initial follow-up may benefit from a follow-up at 2 years due to measurement variability that could mask growth. Simple cysts that grow are likely cystadenomas. If a previously suspected simple cyst demonstrates papillary projections or solid areas at follow-up, then the cyst should be described by using standardized terminology. These updated SRU consensus recommendations apply to asymptomatic patients and to those whose symptoms are not clearly attributable to the cyst. These recommendations can reassure physicians and patients regarding the benign nature of simple adnexal cysts after a diagnostic-quality US examination that allows for confident diagnosis of a simple cyst. Patients will benefit from less costly follow-up, less anxiety related to these simple cysts, and less surgery for benign lesions. Authors: Levine D; 2019 Sep 24.

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery to Change Process Measures and Reduce Opioid Use After Cesarean Delivery: A Quality Improvement Initiative To evaluate implementation of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program for patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery by comparing opioid exposure, multimodal analgesia use, and other process and outcome measures before and after implementation. An ERAS program was implemented among patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery in a large integrated health care delivery system. We conducted a pre-post study of ERAS implementation to compare changes in process and outcome measures during the 12 months before and 12 months after implementation. The study included 4,689 patients who underwent an elective cesarean delivery in the 12 months before (pilot sites: March 1, 2015-February 29, 2016, all other sites: October 1, 2015-September 30, 2016), and 4,624 patients in the 12 months after (pilot sites: April 1, 2016-March 31, 2017, all other sites: November 1, 2016-October 31, ERAS program implementation. After ERAS implementation mean inpatient opioid exposure (average daily morphine equivalents) decreased from 10.7 equivalents (95% CI 10.2-11.3) to 5.4 equivalents (95% CI 4.8-5.9) controlling for age, race-ethnicity, prepregnancy body mass index, patient reported pain score, and medical center. The use of multimodal analgesia (ie, acetaminophen and neuraxial anesthesia) increased from 9.7% to 88.8%, the adjusted risk ratio (RR) for meeting multimodal analgesic goals was 9.13 (RR comparing post-ERAS with pre-ERAS; 95% CI 8.35-10.0) and the proportion of time patients reported acceptable pain scores increased from 82.1% to 86.4% (P<.001). Outpatient opioids dispensed at hospital discharge decreased from 85.9% to 82.2% post-ERAS (P<.001) and the average number of dispensed pills decreased from 38 to 26 (P<.001). The hours to first postsurgical ambulation decreased by 2.7 hours (95% CI -3.1 to -2.4) and the hours to first postsurgical solid intake decreased by 11.1 hours (95% CI -11.5 to -10.7). There were no significant changes in hospital length of stay, surgical site infections, hospital readmissions, or breastfeeding rates. Implementation of an ERAS program in patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery was associated with a reduction in opioid inpatient and outpatient exposure and with changes in surgical process measures of care without worsened surgical outcomes.

Considerations for Identifying Social Needs in Health Care Systems: A Commentary on the Role of Predictive Models in Supporting a Comprehensive Social Needs Strategy Authors: Nau 09;57(9):661-666. Do no harm: a roadmap for responsible machine learning for health care Interest in machine-learning applications within medicine has been growing, but few studies have progressed to deployment in patient care. We present a framework, context and ultimately guidelines for accelerating the translation of machine-learning-based interventions in health care. To be successful, translation will require a team of engaged stakeholders and a systematic process from beginning (problem formulation) to end (widespread deployment).

Identifying Common Predictors of Multiple Adverse Outcomes Among Elderly Adults With Type-2 Diabetes As part of a multidisciplinary team managing patients with type-2 diabetes, pharmacists need a consistent approach of identifying and prioritizing patients at highest risk of adverse outcomes. Our objective was to identify which predictors of adverse outcomes among type-2 diabetes patients were significant and common across 7 outcomes and whether these predictors improved the performance of risk prediction models. Identifying such predictors would allow pharmacists and other health care providers to prioritize their patient panels. Our study population included 120,256 adults aged 65 years or older with type-2 diabetes from a large integrated health system. Through an observational retrospective cohort study design, we assessed which risk factors were associated with 7 adverse outcomes (hypoglycemia, hip fractures, syncope, emergency department visit or hospital admission, death, and 2 combined outcomes). We split (50:50) our study cohort into a test and training set. We used logistic regression to model outcomes in the test set and performed k-fold validation (k=5) of the combined outcome (without death) within the validation set. The most significant predictors across the 7 outcomes were: age, number of medicines, prior history of outcome within the past 2 years, chronic kidney disease, depression, and retinopathy. Experiencing an adverse outcome within the prior 2 years was the strongest predictor of future adverse outcomes (odds ratio range: 4.15-7.42). The best performing models across all outcomes included: prior history of outcome, physiological characteristics, comorbidities and pharmacy-specific factors (c-statistic range: 0.71-0.80). Pharmacists and other health care providers can use models with prior history of adverse event, number of medicines, chronic kidney disease, depression and retinopathy to prioritize interventions for elderly patients with type-2 Med Care. 2019 09;57(9):702-709. Association of Anxiety With High-Cost Health Care Use Among Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes People with type 2 diabetes vary greatly in their use of high-cost health care resources. We examined the association of anxiety with high-cost use after accounting for depression and medical comorbidity. Using electronic health record data, we assessed past anxiety diagnosis, health care use and costs, demographics, comorbidities, and diabetes control status and complications during 2008-2012 for 143,573 adult members of an integrated health care system with type 2 diabetes. Multivariable regression models estimated associations between anxiety and emergency department (ED) use, total hospitalization costs, and high-cost status (i.e., incurring total health care costs in the top 20% among all system members). During 2008-2011, 12.9% of participants received a diagnosis of anxiety, of whom 52.9% also had received a depression diagnosis. After adjustment for covariates including depression, anxiety was positively related to the number of ED visits in 2012 (incidence rate ratio 1.27; 95% CI 1.21, 1.34), the likelihood of visiting the ED on a chronic, frequent basis during 2010-2012 (odds ratio 2.55; 95% CI 1.90, 3.44), and high-cost status in 2012 (odds ratio 1.29; 95% CI 1.23, 1.36), but anxiety was not related to total hospitalization costs in 2012 (relative cost ratio 1.06; 95% CI 0.94, 1.21; P = 0.33). Anxiety is highly comorbid with depression among individuals with type 2 diabetes and is independently associated with high-cost resource use. Strategies to improve anxiety management among people with diabetes hold the potential to also reduce health care costs. Authors: Iturralde E; 09;42(9):1669-1674. Epub 2019-06-18.

A Seat at the Table: Strategic Engagement in Service Activities for Early Career Faculty From Underrepresented Groups in the Academy Many academic institutions strive to promote more diverse and inclusive campuses for faculty, staff, and students. As part of this effort, these institutions seek to include individuals from historically underrepresented groups (URGs)-such as women, people from racial/ethnic minority populations, persons with disabilities-on committees and in other service activities. However, given the low number of faculty members from URGs at many institutions, these faculty members tend to receive more requests to provide service to the institution or department (e.g., serving on committees, mentoring) than their counterparts from majority groups. Faculty members from URGs, especially early-career faculty, thus risk becoming overburdened with providing service at the expense of working on other scholarly activities required for promotion and tenure (i.e., conducting research, publishing). Although many scholars and others have written about this \"minority tax\" and its implications for early-career faculty from underrepresented racial/ethnic minority groups, fewer have published about how this tax extends beyond racial/ethnic minorities to women and persons with disabilities. Further, the literature provides scant practical advice on how to avoid overburdening early-career faculty from URGs. Here, a group of multidisciplinary early- and mid-career faculty members from URGs seek to provide their peers from URGs with practical strategies for both evaluating the appropriateness of service requests and declining those that are not a good fit. The authors also provide institutional leaders with actionable recommendations to prevent early-career faculty from URGs from becoming overburdened with Med. 2019 08;94(8):1089-1093. Targeted learning with daily EHR data Electronic health records (EHR) data provide a cost- and time-effective opportunity to conduct cohort studies of the effects of multiple time-point interventions in the diverse patient population found in real-world clinical settings. Because the computational cost of analyzing EHR data at daily (or more granular) scale can be quite high, a pragmatic approach has been to partition the follow-up into coarser intervals of pre-specified length (eg, quarterly or monthly intervals). The feasibility and practical impact of analyzing EHR data at a granular scale has not been previously evaluated. We start filling these gaps by leveraging large-scale EHR data from a diabetes study to develop a scalable targeted learning approach that allows analyses with small intervals. We then study the practical effects of selecting different coarsening intervals on inferences by reanalyzing data from the same large-scale pool of patients. Specifically, we map daily EHR data into four analytic datasets using 90-, 30-, 15-, and 5-day intervals. We apply a semiparametric and doubly robust estimation approach, the longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (TMLE), to estimate the causal effects of four dynamic treatment rules with each dataset, and compare the resulting inferences. To overcome the computational challenges presented by the size of these data, we propose a novel TMLE implementation, the \"long-format TMLE,\" and rely on the latest advances in scalable data-adaptive machine-learning software, xgboost and h2o, for estimation 2019 Visit Priorities in Primary Care: Psychosocial Versus Medically-Related Concerns Primary care providers (PCPs) are often challenged to address multiple patient concerns during time-limited visits. The need for PCPs to limit the number of issues addressed may have a negative impact on discussion of patient-defined visit priorities. Using data from a recent clinical trial (Aligning Patients and Providers, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02707146), we examined the association between patient-defined visit priorities and subsequent provider actions taken during and after the visit. We tested the hypothesis that psychosocial concerns (eg, stress, anxiety, caregiving demands) are less likely to be addressed than traditional medical concerns. We analyzed 147 patient-defined visit priorities submitted just before the visit by 109 patients (mean age, 59.0 \u00b1 12.7 years; including 73.4% women, 47.7% non-White race/ethnicity). Nearly one quarter of patient-defined visit priorities were related to psychosocial concerns (35/147; 23.8%). In models adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and familiarity with PCP, patients' psychosocial priorities were significantly less likely than medical priorities to be addressed during the visit (63% vs. 88%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.16; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.41; P < action vs. 82%; aOR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.38; P < .001), or to receive post visit information from the primary care doctor (17% vs. 32%; aOR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.14 to 1.08; P = .07). Patient-defined psychosocial priorities are less likely to be addressed during (or immediately after) primary care visits compared with patient-defined medical Fam Med. 2019 Jul-Aug;32(4):513-520. Opportunities to encourage mail order pharmacy delivery service use for diabetes prescriptions: a qualitative study Medication non-adherence is a major contributor to poor outcomes in diabetes. Previous research has shown an association between use of mail order pharmacy delivery and better medication adherence, but little is known about the barriers and facilitators to mail order pharmacy use in diabetes patients. This qualitative study examined factors related to mail order pharmacy use versus traditional \"brick and mortar\" pharmacies to refill prescriptions. We conducted four 90-min focus groups in 2016 among 28 diabetes patients in the Hawaii and Northern California regions of Kaiser Permanente, a large integrated health care delivery system. We queried participants on their preferred mode for refilling prescriptions and perceived barriers and facilitators of mail order pharmacy use. One researcher independently coded each focus group transcript, with two of these transcripts double-coded by a second researcher to promote reliability. We employed thematic analysis guided by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) framework using NVivo 11 software. A total of 28 diabetes patients participated. Participants' average age was 64.1 years; 57% and non-Hispanic White (36%). Analysis uncovered 26 themes related to the decision to use mail order pharmacy, with each theme representing a barrier or facilitator mapped to the COM-B framework. Most themes (20/26) fell into the COM-B category of 'Opportunity.' Opportunity barriers to mail order pharmacy use included unpredictability of medication delivery date, concerns about mail security, and difficulty coordinating refill orders for multiple prescriptions. In contrast, facilitators included greater access and convenience (e.g., no need to wait in line or arrange transportation) compared to traditional pharmacies. Motivational facilitators to mail order pharmacy use included receiving a pharmacy benefit plan incentive of a free one-month supply of prescriptions. This study found that while patients with diabetes may benefit from mail order pharmacy use, they perceive numerous barriers to using the service. These findings will inform the design of interventions and quality improvement initiatives to increase mail order pharmacy use, which in turn may improve medication adherence and outcomes in diabetes patients, across health care systems.

Prompting Patients with Poorly Controlled Diabetes to Identify Visit Priorities Before Primary Care Visits: a Pragmatic Cluster Randomized Trial Most patients with diabetes do not meet all evidence-based goals of care, and many patients report poor communication and lack of involvement in decision-making during primary care visits. To test the hypothesis that a \"Pre-Visit Prioritization\" secure email message could improve visit communication and glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a pragmatic, provider-randomized, multi-site clinical trial from March 2015 to October 2016 across 30 primary care practices within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated care delivery system. Eligible patients had at least 1 year of KPNC membership, type 2 diabetes with most recently measured hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)?>?=?8.0%, and were registered users of the KPNC online patient portal. Patients in the intervention arm, upon booking an appointment, received a secure email through the KPNC online portal with a link to the EHR allowing them to submit their top one or two priorities prior to the visit. Control patients received usual care. Glycemic control; change in HbA1c 6 and 12 months after the initial visit; patient-reported outcomes related to patient-provider communication and patient care experiences. During the study period, 1276 patients had at least one eligible visit. In post-visit surveys (n?=?457), more intervention arm patients reported preparing questions for their visit (72% vs 63%, p?=?0.048) and being given treatment choices to consider (81% vs 73%, p?=?0.041). Patients in both arms had similar reductions in HbA1c over the 12-month study period (0.56%?\u00b1?1.45%), with no significant differences between arms. A \"light touch\" email-based pre-visit intervention resulted in improved measures of visit interaction but did not significantly improve glycemic control relative to usual care. Improving diabetes clinical outcomes through more effective primary care visits may require more intensive approaches to patient visit 2019 06;34(6):831-838. Epub 2019-02-11.

Use of financial incentives and text message feedback to increase healthy food purchases in a grocery store cash back program: a randomized controlled trial The HealthyFood (HF) program offers members up to 25% cash back monthly on healthy food purchases. In this randomized controlled trial, we tested the efficacy of financial incentives combined with text messages in increasing healthy food purchases among HF members. Members receiving the lowest (10%) cash back level were randomized to one of six arms: Arm 1 (Usual Care): 10% cash back, no weekly text, standard monthly text; Arm 2: 10% cash back, generic weekly text, standard monthly text; Arm 3: 10% cash back, personalized weekly text, standard monthly text; Arm 4: 25% cash back, personalized weekly text, standard monthly text; Arm 5: 10 + 15%NET cash back, personalized weekly text, standard monthly text; and, Arm 6: 10 + 15%NET cash back, personalized weekly text, unbundled monthly text. In the 10 + 15%NET cash back, the cash back amount was the baseline 10% plus 15% of the net difference between healthy and unhealthy spending. The generic text included information on HF and healthy eating, while the personalized text had individualized feedback on purchases. The standard monthly text contained the cash back amount. The unbundled monthly text included the amount lost due to unhealthy purchases. The primary outcome was the average monthly percent healthy food spending. Secondary outcomes were the percent unhealthy food spending, and the percent healthy and unhealthy food items. Of the members contacted, 20 opted out, and 2841 met all inclusion criteria. There were no between-arm differences in the examined outcomes. The largest mean (standard deviation) difference in percent healthy spending was between Arm 1 (24.8% [11%]) and Arm 2 (26.8% [13%]), and the largest mean difference in percent unhealthy spending was also between Arm 1 (24.4% [20%]) and Arm 2 (21.7% [17%]), but no differences were statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. None of the tested financial incentive structures or text strategies differentially affected food purchasing. Notably, more than doubling the cash back amount and introducing a financial disincentive for unhealthy purchases did not affect purchasing. These findings speak to the difficulty of changing shopping habits and to the need for innovative strategies to shift complex health behaviors.

Medical Malpractice Involving Pulmonary/Critical Care Physicians. BACKGROUND: Medical malpractice data can be leveraged to understand specialty-specific risk.METHODS: Malpractice claims were examined from the Comparative Benchmarking System (2007-2016), a national database containing > 30% of claims data in the United States. Claims were identified with either internal medicine or pulmonary/critical care (PCC) physicians as the primary provider involved in the harm. Claim characteristics were compared according to specialty and care setting (inpatient vs outpatient), and multiple regression analysis was performed to predict claim payment.RESULTS: Claims involving PCC physicians differed from those involving internal medicine physicians in terms of harm severity, allegation, final diagnosis, procedure involvement, payment rate, and contributing factors. The majority of claims involving PCC physicians resulted from inpatient care (63%), of which only 26% occurred delivering intensive care. Eighty-one percent were from harm events that resulted in death/permanent injury. The most common diagnosis was laceration during a procedure for inpatient claims (6%) and lung cancer for outpatient claims (28%). Thirty-one percent of claims overall involved procedures. Although only 26% were paid, the median indemnity per paid claim of $285,769 ranked PCC as the twelfth highest of 69 specialties. The two variables associated with indemnity payment were outpatient care (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.01-2.86) and temporary harm (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-0.87).CONCLUSIONS: Malpractice claims involving PCC physicians were distinct from claims involving internal medicine physicians. Although only one-quarter of claims was paid, the indemnity per claim was high among specialties. Specialty-specific prevention strategies must be developed to mitigate both patient harm and provider malpractice risk.

Association of Social and Behavioral Risk Factors With Earlier Onset of Adult Hypertension and Diabetes The National Academy of Medicine has recommended incorporating information on social and behavioral factors associated with health, such as educational level and exercise, into electronic health records, but questions remain about the clinical value of doing so. To examine whether National Academy of Medicine-recommended social and behavioral risk factor domains are associated with earlier onset of hypertension and/or diabetes in a clinical population. This prospective cohort study used data collected from April 1, 2005, to December 31, 2016, from a population-based sample of 41 745 patients from 4 cycles of Kaiser Permanente Northern California's Adult Member Health Survey, administered to members at 19 Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical center service populations. The study used Kaplan-Meier survival tables and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to estimate the onset of hypertension and diabetes among patients with no indication of disease at baseline. Data analysis was performed from June 2, 2017, to March 26, 2019. Race/ethnicity, educational level, financial worry, partnership status, stress, intimate partner violence, concentrated neighborhood poverty, depressive symptoms, infrequent exercise, smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and cumulative social and behavioral risk. Onset of hypertension and diabetes during the 3.5 years after survey administration. The study included 18 133 people without baseline hypertension (mean [SD] age, 48.1 [15.3] years; 10 997 [60.7%] female; and 11 503 [63.4%] white) and 35 788 people without baseline diabetes (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [16.9] years; 20 191 [56.4%] female; and 24 351 [68.0%] white). There was a dose-response association between the number of social and behavioral risk factors and likelihood of onset of each condition. Controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and survey year, hazard ratios (HRs) comparing those with 3 or more risk factors with those with 0 risk factor were 1.41 (95% CI, 1.17-1.71) for developing hypertension and 1.53 (95% CI, 1.29-1.82) for developing diabetes. When the same covariates were adjusted for, having less than a high school educational level (hazard ratio [HR], 1.84; 95% CI, 1.40-2.43), being widowed (HR, concentrated neighborhood poverty (HR, 1.26; 1.00-1.59), infrequent exercise (HR, 1.22; and smoking (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.10-1.67) were significantly associated with hypertension onset. Having less than a high school educational level (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.26-1.97), financial worry (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, being single or separated (HR, 1.24; CI, 1.08-1.42), high stress (HR, 1.28; 95% intimate partner violence (HR, 1.68; 95% 1.14-2.48), concentrated neighborhood poverty (HR, 1.31; 1.07-1.60), depressive symptoms (HR, 1.28; and smoking (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.27-1.86) were significantly associated with diabetes onset, although heavy alcohol consumption was associated with protection (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.66-0.85) rather than risk. Independent of traditional risk factors, individual and cumulative social and behavioral risk factor exposures were associated with onset of hypertension and diabetes within 3.5 years in a clinical setting. The findings support the value of assessing social and behavioral risk factors to help identify high-risk patients and of providing targets for intervention. Authors: Pantell MS; a Culturally Responsive Spanish-Language Mobile App for Visit Preparation: Case Study of \"Trans-Creation\" Health information technology (IT) tools are increasingly used to improve patient care. However, implementation of English-only health IT tools could potentially worsen health disparities for non-English speakers. We aim to describe the \"trans-creation\" process of developing linguistically and culturally appropriate health IT tools through a detailed case analysis of a waiting room health mobile app designed to help Spanish-speaking Latino people prepare for primary care visits. We adapted the English-language Visit Planner mobile app for Spanish-speaking Latino patients. We applied culturally defined themes derived from prior published research and input by both skilled linguists and potential end users. Initial changes were iteratively reviewed and edited by a team of writers, health care educators, subject matter experts, patients, and providers. The trans-creation process resulted in the following key culturally mediated changes to the tool: replacing the \"provider\" actors with \"patient\" actors; changing the choice of \"Stress at Home or Work\" (represented by an icon of a house) to \"Mi Familia\" (translation: my family; icon is an outline of family members holding hands); replacing the English terms \"anxiety\" and \"depression\" with \"Me siento desanimado\"(translation: I am feeling down) to avoid mental health stigma; and using more concise text translation to ensure the wording fit the available on-screen space. The trans-creation process of cultural and linguistic adaptation led to several design changes that would not have been implemented if we had simply translated the words from English to Spanish. Epub Digital Information Technology Use and Patient Preferences for Internet-Based Health Education Modalities: Cross-Sectional Survey Study of Middle-Aged and Older Adults With Chronic Health Conditions Health information, patient education, and self-management (health information and advice, HIA) tools are increasingly being made available to adults with chronic health conditions through internet-based health and mobile health (mHealth) digital information technologies. However, there is limited information about patient preferences for using specific types of health information and advice resources and how preferences and usage differ by age group and education. The objective of this study was to examine how use of digital information technologies and preferred methods for obtaining health information and advice varies by age group and education among middle-aged and older adults with chronic health conditions. The study used cross-sectional survey data for 9005 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members aged 45 to 85 years who responded to a mailed and Web-based health survey conducted during 2014 and 2015 and indicated having at least 1 chronic health condition. Bivariate analyses and logistic regression models with weighted data were used to estimate and compare the prevalence of digital information technology use, past-year use of internet-based health information and advice resources, and preferences for using internet-based, mHealth, and traditional health information and advice modalities for adults aged 45 to 65 years, 66 to 75 years, and 76 to 85 years. The percentages of adults who used digital information technologies (computers, smartphones, internet, email, and apps), had obtained health information and advice from an internet-based resource in the past year, and who were interested in using internet-based and mHealth modalities for obtaining health information and advice declined with age. Within age group, prevalence of digital information technologies use and interest in internet-based and mHealth modalities was lower among adults with no college education versus college graduates. Differences in preferences for internet-based health information and advice modalities between the oldest and younger groups and those with lower versus higher education were substantially diminished when we restricted analyses to internet users. Health care providers and organizations serving middle-aged and older adults with chronic health conditions should not assume that patients, especially those who are older and less educated, want to engage with internet-based and mHealth resources. In addition, increasing the engagement of nonutilizers of digital devices and the internet with internet-based health information and advice and mHealth apps might require both instrumental (eg, providing digital information technology devices, internet, and skills training) and social support. As part of patient-centered care, it is important for providers to ascertain their patients' use of digital information technologies and preferences for obtaining health information and patient education rather than routinely referring them to internet-based resources. It is also important for health care providers and consumer health organizations to user test their Web-based resources to make sure they are easy for older and less educated adults to use and to make sure that it remains easy for adults with chronic conditions to obtain health information and patient education using offline resources.

Association between Inpatient Delirium and Hospital Readmission in Patients 65 Years of Age: A Retrospective Cohort Study Delirium affects more than seven million hospitalized adults in the United States annually. However, its impact on postdischarge healthcare utilization remains unclear. To determine the association between delirium and 30-day hospital readmission. A retrospective cohort study. A general community medical and surgical hospital. All adults who were at least 65 years old, without a history of delirium or alcohol-related delirium, and were hospitalized from September 2010 to March 2015. The patients deemed at risk for or displaying symptoms of delirium were screened by nurses using the Confusion Assessment Method with a followup by a staff psychiatrist for a subset of screen-positive patients. Patients with delirium confirmed by a staff psychiatrist were compared with those without delirium. The primary outcome was the 30-day readmission rate. The secondary outcomes included emergency department (ED) visits 30 days postdischarge, mortality during hospitalization and 30 days postdischarge, and discharge location. The cohort included 718 delirious patients and 7,927 nondelirious patients. Using an unweighted multivariable logistic regression, delirium was determined to be significantly associated with the increased odds of readmission within 30 days of discharge (odds ratio (OR): 2.60; 95% CI, 1.96-3.44; P < .0001). Delirium was also significantly (P < .0001) associated with ED visits within 30 days postdischarge (OR: 2.18; 95% 2.09-3.01). Delirium is a significant predictor of hospital readmission, ED visits, and discharge to a location other than home. Delirious patients should be targeted to reduce postdischarge healthcare Brooks Hosp Med. 2019 04;14(4):201-206. The Impact of Pharmacy-specific Predictors on the Performance of 30-Day Readmission Risk Prediction Models Pharmacists are an expensive and limited resource in the hospital and outpatient setting. A pharmacist can spend up to 25% of their day planning. Time spent planning is time not spent delivering an intervention. A readmission risk adjustment model has potential to be used as a universal outcome-based prioritization tool to help pharmacists plan their interventions more efficiently. Pharmacy-specific predictors have not been used in the constructs of current readmission risk models. We assessed the impact of adding pharmacy-specific predictors on performance of readmission risk prediction models. We used an observational retrospective cohort study design to assess whether pharmacy-specific predictors such as an aggregate pharmacy score and drug classes would improve the prediction of 30-day readmission. A model of age, sex, length of stay, and admission category predictors was used as the reference model. We added predictor variables in sequential models to evaluate the incremental effect of additional predictors on the performance of the reference. We used logistic regression to regress the outcomes on predictors in our derivation dataset. We derived and internally validated our models through a 50:50 split validation of our dataset. Our study population (n=350,810) was of adult admissions at hospitals in a large integrated health care delivery system. Individually, the aggregate pharmacy score and drug classes caused a nearly identical but moderate increase in model performance over the reference. As a single predictor, the comorbidity burden score caused the greatest increase in model performance when added to the reference. Adding the severity of illness score, comorbidity burden score and the aggregate pharmacy score to the reference caused a cumulative increase in model performance with good discrimination (c statistic, 0.712; Nagelkerke R, 0.112). The best performing model included all predictors: severity of illness score, comorbidity burden score, aggregate pharmacy score, diagnosis groupings, and drug subgroups. Adding the aggregate pharmacy score to the reference model significantly increased the c statistic but was out-performed by the comorbidity burden score model in predicting readmission. The need for a universal prioritization tool for pharmacists may therefore be potentially met with the comorbidity burden score model. However, the aggregate pharmacy score and drug class models still out-performed current Medicare readmission risk adjustment models. Pharmacists have a great role in preventing readmission, and therefore can potentially use one of our models: comorbidity burden score model, aggregate pharmacy score model, drug class model or complex model (a combination of all 5 major predictors) to prioritize their interventions while exceeding Medicare performance measures on readmission. The choice of model to use should be based on the availability of these predictors in the health care system. Escobar G Med Care. 2019 04;57(4):295-299. Visual outcomes after cataract surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes To assess the relation between diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity, duration of diabetes, insulin dependence, and preoperative hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) with visual outcome after phacoemulsification for cataract in patients with type 2 diabetes. Kaiser Permanente Northern California, USA. Retrospective case series. Information was obtained from the electronic medical record for patients, June 1, 2010, through May 31, 2015. Confounding factors and clustering of eyes within patients were controlled for using linear mixed-effects regression models for continuous outcomes and general estimating equations for dichotomous outcomes. The study included 65 370 patients; 28% had type 2 diabetes without DR, 5% nonproliferative DR, and 1.2% proliferative DR. Patients with diabetes and no DR were as likely as those without diabetes to achieve a corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of 20/20 (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence The odds of a postoperative CDVA of 20/25 or worse increased with the severity of retinopathy duration of diabetes and insulin dependence, but not with the preoperative HbA1c. Although the odds of a postoperative CDVA of 20/20 was lower in patients with DR, every DR group averaged 4 lines of CDVA improvement, the same as patients without diabetes. A longer duration of diabetes, insulin dependence, and elevated HbA1c were not associated with worse postoperative outcomes. Patients with DR and cataracts were less likely to achieve a CDVA of 20/20 vision but gained as many lines of CDVA from phacoemulsification as patients without diabetes, showing no evidence that cataract surgery should be delayed in diabetic patients with elevated Epub 2019-01-09. Association of Medical Scribes in Primary Care With Physician Workflow and Patient Experience Widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) in medical care has resulted in increased physician documentation workload and decreased interaction with patients. Despite the increasing use of medical scribes for EHR documentation assistance, few methodologically rigorous studies have examined the use of medical scribes in primary care. To evaluate the association of use of medical scribes with primary care physician (PCP) workflow and patient experience. This 12-month crossover study with 2 sequences and 4 periods was conducted from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, in 2 medical center facilities within an integrated health care system and included 18 of 24 eligible PCPs. The PCPs were randomly assigned to start the first 3-month period with or without scribes and then alternated exposure status every 3 months for 1 year, thereby serving as their own controls. The PCPs completed a 6-question survey at the end of each study period. Patients of participating PCPs were surveyed after scribed clinic visits. PCP-reported perceptions of documentation burden and visit interactions, objective measures of time spent on EHR activity and required for closing encounters, and patient-reported perceptions of visit quality. Of the 18 participating PCPs, 10 were women, 12 were internal medicine physicians, and 6 were family practice physicians. The PCPs graduated from medical school a mean (SD) of 13.7 (6.5) years before the study start date. Compared with nonscribed periods, scribed periods were associated with less self-reported after-hours EHR documentation (<1 hour daily during ratio [aOR], CI, 2.7-28.7). Scribed periods were also associated with higher likelihood of PCP-reported spending more than 75% of the visit interacting with the patient (aOR, 295.0; 95% CI, 19.7 to >900) and less than 25% of the visit on a computer (aOR, 31.5; 95% CI, 7.3-136.4). Encounter documentation was more likely to be completed by the end of the next business day during scribed periods (aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2-7.1). A total of 450 of 735 patients (61.2%) reported that scribes had a positive bearing on their visits; only 2.4% reported a negative bearing. Medical scribes were associated with decreased physician EHR documentation burden, improved work efficiency, and improved visit interactions. Our results support the use of medical scribes as one strategy for improving physician workflow and visit quality in primary care. Authors: Mishra P; JC; Grant RW 11 01;178(11):1467-1472. Building Toward a Population-Based Approach to Diabetes Screening and Prevention for US Adults Evidence-based treatments for prediabetes can prevent and delay the development of type 2 diabetes in adults. In this review, we propose a framework for population-based diabetes prevention that links screening and prevention activities across key stakeholders. We also discuss gaps in current practice, while highlighting opportunities to improve diabetes screening and prevention efforts population-wide. Awareness of diabetes risk is low, and many adults with prediabetes are not identified through existing screening efforts. Accumulating evidence and policies support expansion of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) into clinical and community settings. However, the infrastructure to facilitate referrals and promote data exchange among patients, clinical settings, and community-based DPP programs is lacking. Development of evidence-driven, scalable processes for assessing diabetes risk, screening eligible adults, and delivering preventive treatments are needed to effectively improve the glycemic health of the US adult 19;18(11):104.

Prevalence and Factors Influencing Use of Internet and Electronic Health Resources by Middle-Aged and Older Adults in a US Health Plan Population: Cross-Sectional Survey Study Health care organizations are increasingly using electronic health (eHealth) platforms to provide and exchange health information and advice (HIA). There is limited information about how factors beyond internet access affect use of eHealth resources by middle-aged and older adults. We aimed to estimate prevalence of use of the internet, health plan patient portal, and Web-based HIA among middle-aged and older adults; investigate whether similar sociodemographic-related disparities in eHealth resource use are found among middle-aged and older adults; and examine how sociodemographic and internet access factors drive disparities in eHealth resource use among adults who use the internet. We analyzed cross-sectional survey data for 10,920 Northern California health plan members aged 45 to 85 years who responded to a mailed and Web-based health survey (2014-2015). We used bivariate and multivariable analyses with weighted data to estimate prevalence of and identify factors associated with internet use and self-reported past year use of the health plan's patient portal and Web-based HIA resources by middle-aged adults (aged 45 to 65 years; n=5520), younger seniors (aged 65 to 75 years; n=3014), and older seniors (aged 76 to 85 years; n=2389). Although approximately 96% of middle-aged adults, 92% of younger seniors, and 76% of older seniors use the internet to obtain information, about 4%, 9%, and 16%, respectively, require someone's help to do so. The percentages who used the patient portal and Web-based HIA resources were similar for middle-aged adults and younger seniors but lower among older seniors (59.6%, 61.4%, and 45.0% and 47.9%, 48.4%, and 37.5%, respectively). Disparities in use of the internet, patient portal, and Web-based HIA across levels of education and between low and higher income were observed in all age groups, with wider disparities between low and high levels of education and income among seniors. Multivariable analyses showed that for all 3 age groups, educational attainment, ability to use the internet without help, and having 1 or more chronic condition were significant predictors of patient portal and Web-based HIA use after controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, and internet use. Internet use, and especially use without help, significantly declines with age, even within a middle-aged group. Educational attainment is significantly associated with internet use, ability to use the internet without help, and use of patient portal and Web-based HIA resources by middle-aged and older adults. Even among middle-aged and older adult internet users, higher educational attainment and ability to use the internet without help are positively associated with patient portal and Web-based HIA use. Organizations serving middle-aged and older adults should take into account target population characteristics when developing and evaluating uptake of eHealth resources and should consider offering instruction and support services to boost patient engagement.

Visit Planning Using a Waiting Room Health IT Tool: The Aligning Patients and Providers Randomized Controlled Trial Time during primary care visits is limited. We tested the hypothesis that a waiting room health information technology (IT) tool to help patients identify and voice their top visit priorities would lead to better visit interactions and improved quality of care. We designed a waiting room tool, the Visit Planner, to guide adult patients through the process of identifying their top priorities for their visit and effectively expressing these priorities to their clinician. We tested this tool in a cluster-randomized controlled trial with usual care as the control. Eligible patients had at least 1 clinical care gap (eg, overdue for cancer screening, suboptimal chronic disease risk factor control, or medication nonadherence). The study (conducted March 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017) included 750 English- or Spanish-speaking patients. Compared with usual care patients, intervention patients more often reported \"definitely\" preparing questions for their doctor (59.5% vs 45.1%, P <.001) and \"definitely\" expressing their top concerns at the beginning of the visit (91.3% vs 83.3%, P = .005). Patients in both arms reported high levels of satisfaction with their care (86.8% vs 89.9%, P = .20). With 6 months of follow-up, prevalence of clinical care gaps was reduced by a similar amount in each study arm. A simple waiting room-based tool significantly improved visit communication. Patients using the Visit Planner were more prepared and more likely to begin the visit by communicating their top priorities. These changes did not, however, lead to further reduction in aggregate clinical care gaps beyond the improvements seen in the usual care arm. 03;17(2):141-149. Statistical Modeling and Aggregate-Weighted Scoring Systems in Prediction of Mortality and ICU Transfer: A Systematic Review The clinical deterioration of patientsin general hospital wards is an important safety issue. Aggregate-weighted early warning systems (EWSs) may not detect risk until patients present with acute decline. We aimed to compare the prognostic test accuracy and clinical workloads generated by EWSs using statistical modeling (multivariable regression or machine learning) versus aggregate-weighted tools. We searched PubMed and CINAHL using terms that described clinical deterioration and use of an advanced EWS. The outcome was clinical deterioration (intensive care unit transfer or death) of adult patients on general hospital wards. We included studies published from January 1, 2012 to September 15, 2018. Following 2015 PRIMSA systematic review protocol guidelines; 2015 TRIPOD criteria for predictive model evaluation; and the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines, we reported model performance, adjusted positive predictive value (PPV), and conducted simulations of workup-to-detection ratios. Of 285 articles, six studies reported the model performance of advanced EWSs, and five were of high quality. All EWSs using statistical modeling identified at-risk patients with greater precision than aggregate-weighted EWSs (mean AUC 0.80 vs 0.73). EWSs using statistical modeling generated 4.9 alerts to find one true positive case versus 7.1 alerts in aggregate-weighted EWSs; a nearly 50% relative workload increase for aggregate-weighted EWSs. Compared with aggregate-weighted tools, EWSs using statistical modeling consistently demonstrated superior prognostic performance and generated less workload to identify and treat one true positive case. A standardized approach to reporting EWS model performance is needed, including outcome definitions, pretest probability, observed and adjusted PPV, and C J Hosp Med. 2019 Mar;14(3):161-169. The Legacy Effect in Type 2 Diabetes: Impact of Early Glycemic Control on Future Complications (the Diabetes & Aging Study) To examine for a legacy effect of early glycemic control on diabetic complications and death. This cohort study of managed care patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 10 years of survival (1997-2013, average follow-up 13.0 years, N mmol/mol), or 0-3, future microvascular (end-stage renal disease, advanced eye disease, amputation) and macrovascular (stroke, heart disease/failure, vascular disease) events and death, adjusting for demographics, risk factors, comorbidities, and later HbA1c. Compared with HbA1c <6.5% (<48 exposure period, levels 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) were associated with increased levels 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) with [53 to to HbA1c levels 8.0% (64 mmol/mol) were associated with increasing microvascular event and mortality risk. Among patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and 10 years of survival, HbA1c levels 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) for the 1st year after diagnosis were associated with worse outcomes. Immediate, intensive treatment for newly diagnosed patients may be necessary to avoid irremediable long-term risk for diabetic complications and mortality. Authors: repair Pediatric laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is widely accepted. Children 0-14 years who underwent inguinal hernia repair during 2010-2016 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California were classified into five groups: (1) open unilateral repair without contralateral exploration; (2) open unilateral repair with contralateral laparoscopic exploration (\"open+explore\"); (3) open bilateral repair; (4) laparoscopic unilateral repair; and laparoscopic bilateral repair. Outcomes included ipsilateral reoperation, metachronous contralateral repair, incision time, and complications. The study included 1697 children. Follow-up averaged 3.6 years after open (N = 1156) and 2.6 years after laparoscopic (N = 541) surgery. Metachronous contralateral repair was performed in 3.8% (26/683) of patients with open unilateral surgery without contralateral exploration, 0.7% (2/275) of open+explore patients, and KJ Diabetes Care. 2019 Feb 14. Sexual Orientation Disparities in Physical Activity: Results From Insured Adults in California The majority of adults in the United States fail to meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) physical activity (PA) guideline recommendations for health promotion. Despite evidence of disparities by sexual orientation in adverse health outcomes related to PA, little is known about whether PA patterns and the likelihood of meeting these guidelines differ between heterosexual and sexual minority (SM) men and women. In 2018, we pooled unweighted respondent data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California Member Health Surveys conducted in 2008, 2011, and 2014/15 (N=42,534) to compare PA patterns among heterosexual and SM men and women. In total, 38.8% of heterosexual men, 43.4% of SM men, 32.9% of heterosexual women, and 40.0% of SM women meet the CDC PA guidelines, yet there was no statistically significant difference in the adjusted odds of meeting these guidelines. Compared with heterosexual women, SM women engage in PA more frequently [odds ratio=0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74-0.89], for more minutes per week on average (12.71; 95% CI, 4.85-20.57), and at higher levels of intensity (relative risk ratio=1.26; 95% CI, 1.02-1.56). Compared with heterosexual men, SM men engage in PA more frequently (OR=0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.98), for fewer minutes per week on average (-12.89; 95% CI, -25.84 to 0.06), and at lower levels of intensity (relative risk ratio=0.83; 95% CI, 0.67-0.99). We find that SMs get more frequent PA than their heterosexual peers, which suggests that the higher prevalence of obesity and other PA-related adverse health outcomes among SMs may be due to factors other than PA patterns.

A mixed methods analysis of provider counseling about combined hormonal contraception In this study we aimed to investigate the content and process of contraceptive counseling surrounding combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) methods (combined oral contraceptives, the ring, and the patch). We performed a mixed methods analysis of data collected as part of the Patient-Provider Communication about Contraception study, in which reproductive age women and their providers were recruited at several San Francisco Bay Area clinics from 2009-2012. Participants completed pre- and post-visit surveys, and had their visits audio recorded and transcribed. We performed descriptive and bivariate analyses of the entire cohort to examine associations between demographic characteristics and pre-existing method preferences with method selection and counseling content, and coded transcripts of a subset of the sample for salient themes related to content and process of counseling about combined hormonal contraceptive methods using a directed content analysis approach. The overall sample included 342 women, with 152 women (44%) having a preference for a specific CHC prior to their visit, 127 women (37%) had a preference for a non-CHC method, and 63 (18%) having no existing method preference. Of the women who reported preferring a CHC in their pre-visit survey, the majority (72%) chose that method. We found that women were inconsistently counseled about the range of CHC methods. For example, women who had no pre-visit method preference (52%) or who preferred the ring (54%) or the patch (73%) were more likely to receive comprehensive counseling about the three CHC methods than were women who preferred combined oral contraceptives (35%) or non-CHC methods (33%). Providers mentioned the patch the least often, and in qualitative analysis indicated discomfort with prescribing this method. Side effects and benefits of methods, as well as strategies to enhance successful use of the chosen method, were inconsistently discussed. In only 73% of visits in which a woman chose a CHC did the provider assess the patient's ability to use the chosen method correctly, and in 66% of all visits in which women chose a CHC method, providers discussed what to do if she was dissatisfied with the method. Counseling about combined hormonal contraceptive methods often does not include information about all available methods, or comprehensive information about side effects, benefits, or logistics of use. As this counseling can impact patient's satisfaction with and continuation of their chosen method of contraception, future work should focus on designing interventions to improve providers' ability to meet patients' needs. Short acting hormonal contraception is widely used, but counseling for these methods often neglects key features. Comprehensive counseling about all methods and their individual features can improve contraceptive selection and use. to Comment on Laiteerapong et al.

Automated Early Detection of Obstetric Complications: Theoretical and Methodological Considerations Compared to adults admitted to general medical-surgical wards, women admitted to labor and delivery services are at much lower risk of experiencing unexpected critical illness. Nonetheless, critical illness and other complications that put either the mother or fetus at risk do occur. One potential approach to prevention is to use automated early warning systems such as those used for non-pregnant adults. Predictive models using data extracted in real time from electronic records constitute the cornerstone of such systems. This article addresses several issues involved in the development of such predictive models: specification of temporal characteristics, choice of denominator, selection of outcomes for model calibration, potential uses of existing adult severity of illness scores, approaches to data processing, statistical considerations, validation, and options for instantiation. These have not been explicitly addressed in the obstetrics literature, which has focused on the use of manually assigned scores. In addition, this article provides some results from work in progress to develop two obstetric predictive models using data from 262,071 women admitted to a labor and delivery service at 15 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals between 2010 and 2017.

Long-Term Outcomes Among Patients Discharged From the Hospital With Moderate Anemia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Randomized clinical trial findings support decreased red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and short-term tolerance of in-hospital anemia. However, long-term outcomes related to changes in transfusion practice have not been described. To describe the prevalence of anemia at and after hospital discharge and associated morbidity and mortality events. Retrospective cohort study. Integrated health care delivery system with 21 hospitals serving 4 million members. 445 371 surviving adults who had 801 261 hospitalizations between January 2010 and December 2014. Hemoglobin levels and RBC transfusion, rehospitalization, and mortality events within 6 months of hospital discharge. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine trends over time, accounting for correlated observations and patient-level covariates. From 2010 to 2014, the prevalence of moderate anemia (hemoglobin levels between 7 and 10 g/dL) at hospital discharge increased from 20% to 25% (P < 0.001) and RBC transfusion declined by 28% (39.8 to 28.5 RBC units per 1000 patients; P < 0.001). The proportion of patients whose moderate anemia had resolved within 6 months of hospital discharge decreased from 42% to 34% (P < 0.001), and RBC transfusion and rehospitalization within 6 months of hospital discharge decreased from 19% to 17% and 37% to 33%, respectively (P < 0.001 for both). During this period, the adjusted 6-month mortality rate decreased from 16.1% to 15.6% (P = 0.004) in patients with moderate anemia, in parallel with that of all others. Possible unmeasured confounding. Anemia after hospitalization increased in parallel with decreased RBC transfusion. This increase was not accompanied by a rise in subsequent RBC use, rehospitalization, or mortality within 6 months of hospital discharge. Longitudinal analyses support the safety of practice recommendations to limit RBC transfusion and tolerate anemia during and after hospitalization. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

Patients with complex chronic conditions: Health care use and clinical events associated with access to a patient portal For patients with diabetes, many with multiple complex chronic conditions, using a patient portal can support self-management and coordination of health care services, and may impact the frequency of in-person health care visits. To examine the impact of portal access on the number of outpatient visits, emergency visits, and preventable hospitalizations. Observational study comparing patients' visit rates with and without portal access, using marginal structural modeling with inverse probability weighting estimates to account for potential bias due to confounding and attrition. Large integrated delivery system which implemented a patient portal (2006-2007). We examined 165,447 patients with diabetes defined using clinical registries. Our study included both patients with diabetes-only and patients with multiple complex chronic conditions (diabetes plus asthma, congestive artery disease, congestive heart failure, or hypertension). We examined rates of outpatient office visits, emergency room visits, and preventable hospitalizations (for ambulatory care sensitive conditions). Access to a patient portal was associated with significantly higher rates of outpatient office visits, in both patients with diabetes only and in patients with multiple complex conditions (p<0.05). In patients with multiple complex chronic conditions, portal use was also associated with significantly fewer emergency room visits (3.9 fewer per 1,000 patients per month, p<0.05) and preventable hospital stays (0.8 fewer per 1,000 patients per month, p<0.05). In patients with only diabetes, the results were directionally consistent but not statistically significantly associated with emergency room visits and preventable hospital stays. Observational study in an integrated delivery system. Access to a patient portal can increase engagement in outpatient visits, potentially addressing unmet clinical needs, and reduce downstream health events that lead to emergency and hospital care, particularly among patients with multiple complex conditions.

Diagnostic thresholds for pregnancy hyperglycemia, maternal weight status and the risk of childhood obesity in a diverse Northern California cohort using health care delivery system data To estimate the risk of childhood obesity associated with the various criteria proposed for diagnosis of gestational diabetes (GDM), and the joint effects with maternal BMI. Cohort study of 46,396 women delivering at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care delivery system in 1995-2004 and their offspring, followed through 5-7 years of age. Pregnancy hyperglycemia was categorized according to the screening and oral glucose tolerance test values proposed for the diagnosis of GDM by the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG), Carpenter Coustan (CC), and the National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG). Childhood obesity was defined by the International Obesity Task Force's age and sex-specific BMI cut-offs. Poisson regression models estimated the risks of childhood obesity associated with each category of pregnancy glycemia compared to normal screening, and the joint effects of maternal BMI category and GDM by the CC and the IADPSG criteria. Compared with normal screening, increased risks of childhood obesity were observed for abnormal screening [RR (95% CI): 1.30 (1.22, 1.38)], 1+ abnormal values by the IADPSG or CC [1.47 (1.36, 1.59) and 1.48 (1.37, 1.59), values by CC or NDDG [1.52 and obese women without GDM, obese women with GDM defined by the CC criteria had significantly increased risk of childhood obesity [1.20 (1.07, 1.34)], which was also observed for GDM by the IADSPG [1.18 (1.07, 1.30)], though GDM did not significantly increase the risk of childhood obesity among normal weight or overweight women. The risk of childhood obesity starts to increase at levels of pregnancy glycemia below those used to diagnose GDM and the effect of GDM on childhood obesity risk appears more pronounced in women with obesity. Interventions to reduce obesity and pregnancy hyperglycemia are warranted. Authors: Ehrlich Patient-Reported Symptoms To assess clinician response to real-time patient-reported data about diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) symptoms, we analyzed DPN diagnosis and treatment patterns after administration of a 4-question symptom questionnaire in a large vertically integrated health care system. Retrospective cohort study to analyze data from 160,852 patients screened for DPN symptoms from April 2012 to March 2014. Electronic medical record data were used to study changes in DPN diagnosis, treatment initiation, and treatment intensification. We used logistic regression to study the association of patient characteristics with the odds of clinical response. Of patients queried, 50,684 (31.5%) reported symptoms. Patients reporting DPN symptoms experienced a greater increase in new DPN diagnoses (16 percentage points; p < 0.0001) and medication use (4 percentage points; p < 0.0001) compared with those denying symptoms. Among patients reporting symptoms, women and nonwhite patients were less likely to receive a DPN diagnosis, whereas older patients were more likely to receive a DPN diagnosis. Overall, patients who were older, were Asian (hazard ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval = 0.63-0.77), and had lower socioeconomic status (hazard ratio = 0.89, 95% confidence interval = 0.80-0.99) were less likely to be treated. However, these racial and socioeconomic differences were not statistically significant for patients with preexisting DPN diagnoses. Patients' real-time reports of DPN symptoms were associated with increased clinical activity. Patient- and clinician-level factors associated with the likelihood of receiving a DPN diagnosis need further study because a formal diagnosis may be associated with more equitable treatment. Authors: of Health and Well-Being Among Adults Residing in the Combined Kaiser Permanente Regions Kaiser Permanente commissioned a health and well-being (HWB) survey of adult members and nonmembers in its 8 Regions. To estimate the prevalence of HWB indicators and evaluate differences in prevalence of excellent/very good (E/VG) health and thriving overall in life (thriving) by race/ethnicity, age group, sex, education, and financial situation. Cross-sectional survey conducted by email and phone during Winter 2016-2017 with a racial/ethnic group-stratified quota sample. Participants (N = 26,304) provided sociodemographic characteristics and ratings for 6 HWB indicators. Using population-weighted data, we estimated the prevalence of HWB indicators and used logistic regression models to test for differences in E/VG health and thriving by sociodemographic factors. Overall health and overall life evaluation. Of adults, 52% were in E/VG health and 63% were thriving. Blacks were less likely to be in E/VG health than whites, Hispanics, and Asian/Pacific Islanders, but there was little racial/ethnic variation in those who were thriving. E/VG health and thriving varied significantly by level of education and financial situation. Across all racial/ethnic groups, large differences in percentages were observed in E/VG health and thriving between the lowest and highest levels of education and financial situation but little racial/ethnic variation within education and financial situation strata. Differences in health status and life evaluation are associated very strongly with financial situation and educational attainment, and these social determinants partially explain racial/ethnic disparities in HWB. The lack of strong correlation of health status and life evaluation suggests these are different domains of well-being. Ask Good Questions: Comparing Latinos and Non-Latino Whites Enrolled in a Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Study Latinos face unique challenges engaging with their health care providers for risk management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). To better understand differences in how Latinos and non-Latino whites (NLWs) experience CVD care. We examined self-reported activation, engagement, confidence, and communication comparing Latinos (n = 194) and NLWs (n = 208). Data were taken from baseline survey assessments of participants in the CREATE Wellness Study (NCT02302612), designed to help patients with poorly controlled CVD risk factors more actively engage in their care. The groups were compared using ?2 tests and separate logistic regression models adjusting for age, age and income, and age and educational attainment. Latinos in this cohort were younger, were less educated, and had lower incomes than did NLWs. In age-adjusted models, Latinos were significantly less likely to report knowing how to ask good questions about their health (71.1% vs 83.7% for NLW, p < 0.01; adjusted odds ratio = 0.49, 95% confidence interval = 0.29-0.83). Further adjustment by educational attainment or income did not attenuate this association. Latinos were also significantly more likely to report positive experiences and confidence with several measures of chronic illness care (adjusted odds ratio range = 1.57-2.01). Further adjustment by educational attainment eliminated these associations. We found notable differences between Latinos and NLWs in their experience of health care. These results provide insights into how CVD risk management programs can be tailored for Latinos. Interventions to improve patient activation and engagement for Latinos with CVD should emphasize question-asking 2019;23. Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures of alcohol and drug treatment initiation and engagement among people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and patients without an HIV diagnosis Background: Problematic use of alcohol and other drugs (AOD) is highly prevalent among people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH), and untreated AOD use disorders have particularly detrimental effects on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) outcomes. The Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures of treatment initiation and engagement are important benchmarks for access to AOD use disorder treatment. To inform improved patient care, we compared HEDIS measures of AOD use disorder treatment initiation and engagement and health care utilization among PLWH and patients without an HIV diagnosis. Methods: Patients with a new AOD use disorder diagnosis documented between October 1, 2014, and August 15, 2015, were identified using electronic health records (EHR) and insurance claims data from 7 health care systems in the United States. Demographic characteristics, clinical diagnoses, and health care utilization data were also obtained. AOD use disorder treatment initiation and engagement rates were calculated using HEDIS measure criteria. Factors associated with treatment initiation and engagement were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. Results: There were 469 PLWH (93% male) and 86,096 patients without an HIV diagnosis (60% male) in the study cohort. AOD use disorder treatment initiation was similar in PLWH and patients without an HIV diagnosis (10% vs. 11%, respectively). Among those who initiated treatment, few engaged in treatment in both groups (9% PLWH vs. 12% patients without an HIV diagnosis). In multivariable analysis, HIV status was not significantly associated with either AOD use disorder treatment initiation or engagement. Conclusions: AOD use disorder treatment initiation and engagement rates were low in both PLWH and patients without an HIV diagnosis. Future studies need to focus on developing strategies to efficiently integrate AOD use disorder treatment with medical care for 2019-03-25. Patient characteristics associated with treatment initiation and engagement among individuals diagnosed with alcohol and other drug use disorders in emergency department and primary care settings Background: Treatment initiation and engagement rates for alcohol and other drug (AOD) use disorders differ depending on where the AOD use disorder was identified. Emergency department (ED) and primary care (PC) are 2 common settings where patients are identified; however, it is unknown whether characteristics of patients who initiate and engage in treatment differ between these settings. Methods: Patients identified with an AOD disorder in ED or PC settings were drawn from a larger study that examined Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) AOD treatment initiation and engagement measures across 7 health systems using electronic health record data (n = 54,321). Multivariable generalized linear models, with a logit link, clustered on health system, were used to model patient factors associated with initiation and engagement in treatment, between and within each setting. Results: Patients identified in the ED had higher odds of initiating treatment than those identified in PC (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.73-2.07), with no difference in engagement between the settings. Among those identified in the ED, compared with patients aged 18-29, older patients had higher odds of treatment initiation (age 30-49: aOR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.12-1.40; age 1.42, = 65+: aOR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.08-1.49). However, among those identified in PC, compared with patients aged 18-29, older patients were less likely to initiate (age 30-49: aOR = 0.81, 0.47, 95% CI = 0.40-0.56). Women identified in ED had lower odds of initiating treatment (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.72-0.88), whereas sex was not associated with treatment initiation in PC. In both settings, patients aged 65+ had lower odds of engaging compared with patients aged 18-29 (ED: aOR = 0.26-0.68). Conclusion: Initiation and engagement in treatment differed by sex and age depending on identification setting. This information could inform tailoring of future AOD interventions. 2019-01-31. Using natural language processing and machine learning to classify health literacy from secure messages: The ECLIPPSE study Limited health literacy is a barrier to optimal healthcare delivery and outcomes. Current measures requiring patients to self-report limitations are time-consuming and may be considered intrusive by some. This makes widespread classification of patient health literacy challenging. The objective of this study was to develop and validate \"literacy profiles\" as automated indicators of patients' health literacy to facilitate a non-intrusive, economic and more comprehensive characterization of health literacy among a health care delivery system's membership. To this end, three literacy profiles were generated based on natural language processing (combining computational linguistics and machine learning) using a sample of 283,216 secure messages sent from 6,941 patients to their primary care physicians. All patients were participants in Kaiser Permanente Northern California's DISTANCE Study. Performance of the three literacy profiles were compared against a gold standard of patient self-reported health literacy. Associations were analyzed between each literacy profile and patient demographics, health outcomes and healthcare utilization. T-tests were used for numeric data such as A1C, Charlson comorbidity index and healthcare utilization rates, and chi-square tests for categorical data such as sex, race, poor adherence and severe hypoglycemia. Literacy profiles varied in their test characteristics, with C-statistics ranging from 0.61-0.74. Relations between literacy profiles and health outcomes revealed patterns consistent with previous health literacy research: patients identified via literacy profiles indicative of limited health literacy: (a) were older and more likely of minority status; (b) had poorer medication adherence and glycemic control; and (c) exhibited higher rates of hypoglycemia, comorbidities and healthcare utilization. This represents the first successful attempt to employ natural language processing to estimate health literacy. Literacy profiles can offer an automated and economical way to identify patients with limited health literacy and greater vulnerability to poor health outcomes. Authors: association between medical comorbidity and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures of treatment initiation and engagement for alcohol and other drug use disorders Background: Medical comorbidity may influence treatment initiation and engagement for alcohol and other drug (AOD) use disorders. We examined the association between medical comorbidity and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) treatment initiation and engagement measures.Methods: We used electronic health record and insurance claims data from 7 US health care systems to identify patients with AOD use disorders between October 1, 2014, and August 15, 2015 (N = 86,565). Among patients identified with AOD use disorders in outpatient and emergency department (ED) settings, we examined how Charlson/Deyo comorbidity index scores and medical complications of AOD use were associated with treatment initiation. Among those who initiated treatment in inpatient and outpatient/ED settings, we also examined how comorbidity and AOD use-related medical complications were associated with treatment engagement. Analyses were conducted using generalized estimating equation logistic regression modeling.Results: Among patients identified as having an AOD diagnosis in outpatient and ED settings (n = 69,965), Charlson/Deyo comorbidity index scores of 2 or more were independently associated with reduced likelihood of initiation (risk ratio [RR] = 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74, 0.86; reference score = 0), whereas prior-year diagnoses of cirrhosis (RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.12, 1.35) and pancreatic disease (RR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.15, 1.56) were associated with greater likelihood of initiation. Among those who were identified in outpatient/ED settings and initiated, higher comorbidity scores were associated with lower likelihood of engagement (score 1: RR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.76, 0.94; score 2+: 95% CI = 0.53, 0.71).Conclusion: Medical comorbidity was associated with lower likelihood of initiating or engaging in AOD treatment, but cirrhosis and pancreatic disease were associated with greater likelihood of initiation. Interventions to improve AOD treatment initiation and engagement for patients with comorbidities are needed, such as integrating medical and associated with Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) alcohol and other drug measure performance in 2014-2015 Background: Only 10% of patients with alcohol and other drug (AOD) disorders receive treatment. The AOD Initiation and Engagement in Treatment (AOD-IET) measure was added to the national Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) to improve access to care. This study identifies factors related to improving AOD-IET rates. Methods: We include data from 7 health systems with differing geographic, patient demographic, and organizational characteristics; all used a common Virtual Data Warehouse containing electronic health records and insurance claims data. Multilevel logistic regression models examined AOD-IET among adults (18+). Results: A total of 86,565 patients had an AOD diagnosis qualifying for the HEDIS denominator. Initiation rates varied from 26% to 46%; engagement rates varied from 14% to 29%. Women versus men (odds ratio [OR] = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = = CI = black/African Americans (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.75-0.90), and Asian Americans (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.72-0.95) versus whites; and patients aged versus 18-29 (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.74-0.90) had lower odds of initiation. Patients aged 30-49 versus 18-29 (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.04-1.19) and those with prior psychiatric (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.18-1.35) and medical (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.10-1.26) conditions had higher odds of engagement. Identification in primary care versus other departments was related to lower odds of initiation (emergency department [ED]: OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.45-1.66; psychiatry/AOD = 3.58, = outpatient: OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.06-1.32). Patients aged 30-49 versus 18-29 had higher odds of engagement (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10-1.43). Patients aged 65+ versus 18-29 (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.43-0.62) and black/African Americans versus whites (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.53-0.77) had lower odds. Those initiating treatment in psychiatry/AOD treatment versus primary care (OR = 7.02, 95% CI = 5.93-8.31) had higher odds of engagement; those in inpatient (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.32-0.50) or other outpatient (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.59-0.91) settings had lower odds. Discussion: Rates of initiation and engagement varied but were low. Findings identified age, race/ethnicity, co-occurring conditions, and department of identification as key factors associated with AOD-IET. Focusing on these could help programs develop interventions that facilitate AOD-IET for those less likely to receive care. prevalence of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) initiation and engagement in treatment among patients with cannabis use disorders in 7 US health systems Background: Cannabis use disorders (CUDs) have increased with more individuals using cannabis, yet few receive treatment. Health systems have adopted the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures of initiation and engagement in alcohol and other drug (AOD) dependence treatment, but little is known about the performance of these among patients with CUDs. Methods: This cohort study utilized electronic health records and claims data from 7 health care systems to identify patients with documentation of a new index CUD diagnosis (no AOD diagnosis 60 days prior) from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision, codes (October 1, 2014, to August 31, 2015). The adjusted prevalence of each outcome (initiation, engagement, and a composite of both) was estimated from generalized linear regression models, across index identification settings (inpatient, emergency department, primary care, addiction treatment, and mental health/psychiatry), AOD comorbidity (patients with CUD only and CUD plus other AOD diagnoses), and patient characteristics. Results: Among 15,202 patients with an index CUD diagnosis, [CI]: 29.2-30.7%) (95% CI: 1.9-2.3%) overall both initiated and engaged in treatment. The adjusted prevalence of outcomes varied across index identification settings and was highest among patients diagnosed in addiction treatment, with 25.0% (95% 10.0-15.1%) initiated and engaged. The adjusted prevalence of each outcome was generally highest among patients with CUD plus other AOD diagnosis at index diagnosis compared with those with CUD only, overall and across index identification settings, and was lowest among uninsured and older patients. Conclusion: Among patients with a new CUD diagnosis, the proportion meeting HEDIS criteria for initiation and/or engagement in AOD treatment was low and demonstrated variation across index diagnosis settings, AOD comorbidity, and patient characteristics, pointing to opportunities Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures of alcohol and other drug treatment initiation and engagement across 7 health care systems Background: Psychiatric comorbidity is common among patients with alcohol and other drug (AOD) use disorders. To better understand how psychiatric comorbidity influences AOD treatment access in health care systems, the present study examined treatment initiation and engagement among a large, diverse sample of patients with comorbid psychiatric and AOD use disorders. Methods: This study utilized data from a multisite observational study examining Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures of initiation and engagement in treatment (IET) among patients with AOD use disorders from 7 health care systems. Participants were aged 18 or older with at least 1 AOD index diagnosis between October 1, 2014, and August 15, 2015. Data elements extracted from electronic health records and insurance claims data included patient demographic characteristics, ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) diagnostic codes, and procedure codes. Descriptive analyses and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between patient-level factors and IET measures. Results: Across health care systems, out of a total of 86,565 patients who had at least 1 AOD index diagnosis during the study period, 66.2% (n = 57,335) patients also had a comorbid psychiatric disorder. Among patients with a comorbid psychiatric disorder, 34.9% (n = 19,998) initiated AOD treatment, and of those, 10.3% (n = 2,060) engaged in treatment. After adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders were more likely to initiate (odds ratio [OR] = 3.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.08, 3.32) but no more likely to engage (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.51, 0.61) in AOD treatment, compared with those without a comorbid psychiatric disorder. Conclusions: Findings suggest that identification of comorbid psychiatric disorders may increase initiation in AOD treatment. However, innovative efforts are needed to enhance treatment engagement both generally and especially for individuals without diagnosed psychiatric conditions. Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) treatment initiation and engagement among patients with opioid use disorder across 7 health systems Background: The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) has increased rapidly in the United States and improving treatment access is critical. Among patients with OUD, we examined factors associated with the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) performance measures of alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment initiation and engagement. Methods: Electronic health record and claims data between October 1, 2014, and August 15, 2015, from 7 health systems were used to identify patients (n = 11,490) with a new index OUD diagnosis (no AOD diagnosis prior <60 days) based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes. Multivariable generalized linear models with a logit link clustered on health system were used to examine the associations of patient demographic and clinical characteristics, and department of index diagnosis, with HEDIS measures of treatment initiation and engagement. Results: The prevalence of OUD among all AOD diagnoses varied across health systems, as did rates of AOD initiation (5.7%-21.6%) and engagement (7.6%-24.6%). Those diagnosed in the emergency department (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27,1.97) treatment (aOR = 2.92, 95% CI = 2.47,3.46) were more likely to initiate treatment compared with primary care. Older patients were less likely to initiate (age 50-64 vs. age 18-29: aOR = 0.42, 95% age 18-29: aOR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.26, 0.43), as women (aOR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.62, (aOR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.98, 3.60) compared with primary care were more likely to engage in treatment. Those identified in an inpatient setting (aOR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.14, 0.27 vs. primary care), those with medical comorbidity (aOR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52, 0.95), (age 0.36, 95% CI = 0.22, 0.57) were less likely to engage in treatment. Conclusions: Rates of initiation and engagement for OUD patients vary widely with noticeable room for improvement, particularly in this critical time of the opioid crisis. Targeting patient and system factors may improve health system performance, which is key to improving patient outcomes. health record maintenance from 2010 to 2015 To describe the scale and scope of inpatient electronic health record (EHR) maintenance following initial implementation. A retrospective study reviewing EHR change documentation within an integrated healthcare delivery system that has 21 hospitals. Between 2010 and 2015, we identified and categorized all significant changes made to the inpatient EHR, as documented within monthly EHR communication updates. We categorized EHR changes as updates to existing functionality or upgrades to new functionality. We grouped changes within larger functional domains as orders, alerts and customization, surgical and emergency department (ED), data review, reports and health information management, and other. We also identified the clinical areas and user roles targeted by these changes. Over a 6-year period, 5551 unique changes were made to the inpatient EHR, with a median of 72 changes per month. Changes most frequently targeted orders (44.7% of 2190 change documents) and order sets (29.9% of documents). In total, changes affected 135 EHR functions. A total of 151 unique user roles were affected by these changes, with the most frequent roles including nurses (30.6%), physicians (26.6%), and other clinical staff (22.7%). The clinical areas most targeted by changes included surgical areas and the ED. Over 6 years, EHR maintenance for clinical functionality was substantial and varied with pervasive impacts, requiring persistent attention, diverse expertise, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

Shake Rattle & Roll - Design and rationale for a pragmatic trial to improve blood pressure control among blacks with persistent hypertension In Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), members had similar access to care and a very high overall rate of hypertension control. However, blacks had poorer blood pressure (BP) control than whites. The Shake Rattle & Roll (SRR) trial aimed to improve BP control rates in blacks and to reduce disparities in hypertension control. SRR was a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted at an urban medical center. All 98 adult primary care physicians (PCP) and their panels of hypertensive black patients were randomized, stratified by panel size, to one of three arms: 1) Usual Care (n?=?33 PCPs, N?=?1129 patients); 2) Enhanced Monitoring arm with an on improving pharmacotherapy protocol adherence (n?=?34 PCPs, N?=?349 patients); or 3) Lifestyle arm with a culturally tailored diet and lifestyle coaching intervention focusing on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension eating plan (n?=?31 PCPs, N?=?286 patients). The intervention period was for 12-months post-enrollment. Follow-up was planned for one and three years post-intervention completion. Primary outcome measure was the proportion of participants with controlled BP, defined as <140/90?mmHg, at 12-months post-enrollment. Secondary outcome included adverse cardiovascular events. An intention-to-treat analysis was carried out as the primary analysis. SRR was a uniquely designed trial that included components from both pragmatic and explanatory methods. The pragmatic aspects allow for a more cost-effective way to conduct a clinical trial and easier implementation of successful interventions into clinical practice. However, there were also challenges of having mixed methodology with regards to trial conduction and analysis. Authors: Nguyen-Huynh 01;76:85-92. Epub 2018-11-28. Automated symptom and treatment side effect monitoring for improved quality of life among adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in primary care: a pragmatic, cluster, randomized, controlled trial To evaluate the effectiveness of automated symptom and side effect monitoring on quality of life among individuals with symptomatic diabetic peripheral neuropathy. We conducted a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial (July 2014 to July 2016) within a large healthcare system. We randomized 1834 primary care physicians and prospectively recruited from their lists 1270 individuals with neuropathy who were newly prescribed medications for their symptoms. Intervention participants received automated telephone-based symptom and side effect monitoring with physician feedback over 6 months. The control group received usual care plus three non-interactive diabetes educational calls. Our primary outcomes were quality of life (EQ-5D) and select symptoms (e.g. pain) measured 4-8 weeks after starting medication and again 8 months after baseline. Process outcomes included receiving a clinically effective dose and communication between individuals with neuropathy and their primary care provider over 12 months. Interviewers collecting outcome data were blinded to intervention assignment. Some 1252 participants completed the baseline measures [mean age (sd): 67 (11.7), 53% female, 57% total, 1179 participants (93%) completed follow-up (619 control, 560 intervention). \u00b1 0.094; control: 0.653 \u00b1 0.092) and symptom severity were similar at baseline. The intervention had no effect on primary [EQ-5D: -0.002 (95% CI -0.01, 0.01), P = 0.247] or process outcomes. Automated telephone monitoring and feedback alone were not effective at improving quality of life or symptoms for people with symptomatic diabetic peripheral Immersive 3D exposure-based treatment for spider fear: A randomized controlled trial. Stereoscopic 3D gives the viewer the same shape, size, perspective and depth they would experience viewing the real world and could mimic the perceptual threat cues present in real life. This is the first study to investigate whether an immersive stereoscopic 3D video exposure-based treatment would be effective in reducing fear of spiders. Participants with a fear of spiders (N = 77) watched two psychoeducational videos with facts about spiders and phobias. They were then randomized to a treatment condition that watched a single session of a stereoscopic 3D immersive video exposure-based treatment (six 5-minute exposures) delivered through a virtual reality headset or a psychoeducation only control condition that watched a 30-minute neutral video (2D documentary) presented on a computer monitor. Assessments of spider fear (Fear of Spiders Questionnaire [FSQ], Behavioral Approach Task [BAT], & subjective ratings of fear) were completed pre- and post-treatment. Consistent with prediction, the stereoscopic 3D video condition outperformed the control condition in reducing fear of spiders showing a large between-group change effect size on the FSQ (Cohen's d = 0.85) and a medium between-group effect size on the BAT (Cohen's d = 0.47). This provides initial support for stereoscopic 3D video in doi: 10.1016/j.janxdis.2018.12.003. Epub 2018 Dec 21. Increasing Safe Outpatient Management of Emergency Department Patients With Pulmonary Embolism: A Controlled Pragmatic Trial Many low-risk patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department (ED) are eligible for outpatient care but are hospitalized nonetheless. One impediment to home discharge is the difficulty of identifying which patients can safely forgo hospitalization. To evaluate the effect of an integrated electronic clinical decision support system (CDSS) to facilitate risk stratification and decision making at the site of care for patients with acute PE. Controlled pragmatic trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03601676). All 21 community EDs of an integrated health care delivery system (Kaiser Permanente Northern California). Adult ED patients with acute PE. Ten intervention sites selected by convenience received a multidimensional technology and education intervention at month 9 of a 16-month study period (January 2014 to April 2015); the remaining 11 sites served as concurrent controls. The primary outcome was discharge to home from either the ED or a short-term (<24-hour) outpatient observation unit based in the ED. Adverse outcomes included return visits for PE-related symptoms within 5 days and recurrent venous thromboembolism, major hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality within 30 days. A difference-in-differences approach was used to compare pre-post changes at intervention versus control sites, with adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics. Among 881 eligible patients diagnosed with PE at intervention sites and 822 at control sites, adjusted home discharge increased at intervention sites (17.4% pre- to 28.0% postintervention) without a concurrent increase at control sites (15.1% pre- and 14.5% postintervention). The difference-in-differences comparison was 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 3.0 to 19.5 percentage points; P = 0.007). No increases were seen in 5-day return visits related to PE or in 30-day major adverse outcomes associated with CDSS implementation. Lack of random allocation. Implementation and structured promotion of a CDSS to aid physicians in site-of-care decision making for ED patients with acute PE safely increased outpatient management.

Background: Following a vegetarian diet is considered to be beneficial for overall health and is associated with a lower risk of chronic disease. Objective: This study examined whether South Asians in the United States who consume a vegetarian diet have a lower prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors. Methods: Data from the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America study, which included 892 South Asians (47% women), with an age range of 40-83 y and a mean +/- SD age of 55 +/- 9.4 y, were used. Participants were classified as vegetarian if they reported no consumption of meat, poultry, or fish in the previous year on a validated and culturally appropriate food-frequency questionnaire. Adjusted linear and logistic regression models were used to examine associations of a vegetarian diet with cardiometabolic risk factors. Results: Thirty-eight percent of the cohort participants were classified as vegetarian. Vegetarians reported more frequent weekly eating occasions of whole grains (median frequency/wk: 10 compared with 9, P = 0.012) and beans and legumes (median frequency/wk: 8.5 compared with 5.1, P < 0.001), and less frequent weekly eating occasions of sweets and desserts (median frequency/wk: 1.9 compared with 2.3, P < 0.001). Consuming a vegetarian diet was associated with lower body mass index (P = 0.023), fasting glucose (P = 0.015), insulin resistance (P = 0.003), total cholesterol (P = 0.027), and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.004) and lower odds of fatty liver (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.78, P = 0.006). The odds of having any coronary artery calcium were lower for vegetarian men (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.87, P = 0.013); however, no significant associations were observed among women. Conclusions: Among US South Asians, a vegetarian diet was associated with fewer cardiometabolic risk factors overall and with less subclinical 10.1093/jn/nxy217. Tele-Triage Outcomes For Patients With Chest Pain: Comparing Physicians And Registered Nurses We took advantage of a change in protocol in an integrated delivery system's telephone consultation service-routing callers complaining of chest pain to physicians instead of registered nurses, whenever feasible-to explore whether tele-triage outcomes differed by staffing type. Comparing outcomes of 11,315 physician-directed calls to those of an equal number of nurse-directed calls in 2013, we found that the physician-directed calls were briefer (eight minutes versus thirteen minutes), produced fewer ED referrals (10 percent versus 16 percent), and resulted in higher patient adherence to the providers' site-of-care recommendation (86 percent versus 82 percent). Mortality rates at seven days were low for both physician- and nurse-directed calls (0.1 percent). We suspect that providers' immediate access to callers' comprehensive electronic health records and patients' rapid access to outpatient care likely contributed to the program's success. Our findings suggest that tele-triage can be used to safely and effectively manage an emergent complaint, and that physicians' expertise may bring additional efficiency to the process.

Patterns of medication adherence in a multi-ethnic cohort of prevalent statin users diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer To investigate the implications of a cancer diagnosis on medication adherence for pre-existing comorbid conditions, we explored statin adherence patterns prior to and following a new diagnosis of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer among a multi-ethnic cohort. We identified adults enrolled at Kaiser Permanente Northern California who were prevalent statin medication users, newly diagnosed with breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer between 2000 and 2012. Statin adherence was measured using the proportion of days covered (PDC) during the 2-year pre-cancer diagnosis and the 2-year post-cancer diagnosis. Adherence patterns were assessed using generalized estimating equations, for all cancers combined and stratified by cancer type and race/ethnicity, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and tumor characteristics. Among 10,177 cancer patients, statin adherence decreased from pre- to post-cancer diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj):0.91, 95% confidence interval (95% CI):0.88-0.94). Statin adherence decreased 95% CI:0.90-0.99) and colorectal (ORadj:0.79, 95% CI:0.74-0.85) cancer patients. No difference in adherence was observed among prostate cancer patients (ORadj:1.01, 95% CI:0.97-1.05). Prior to cancer diagnosis, adherence to statins was generally higher among non-Hispanic whites and multi-race patients than other groups. However, statin adherence after diagnosis decreased only among these two populations (ORadj:0.85, 95% CI:0.85-0.92 and ORadj:0.86, 95% CI:0.76-0.97), respectively. We found substantial variation in statin medication adherence following diagnosis by cancer type and race/ethnicity among a large cohort of prevalent statin users in an integrated health care setting. Improving our understanding of comorbidity management and polypharmacy across diverse cancer patient populations is warranted to develop tailored interventions that improve medication adherence and reduce disparities in health outcomes.

Characteristics of patients with substance use disorder before and after the Affordable Care Act The Affordable Care Act (ACA) offered an unprecedented opportunity to expand insurance coverage to patients with substance use disorders (SUDs). We explored the expectations of key stakeholders for the ACA's impact on SUD care, and examined how clinical characteristics of newly enrolled patients with SUD in a large healthcare delivery system differed pre- and post- ACA implementation. In this mixed-methods study, qualitative interviews were conducted with health system leaders to identify themes regarding how the health system prepared for the ACA. Electronic health record data were used to examine demographics, as well as specific SUD, psychiatric, and medical diagnoses in cohorts of pre-ACA (2012, n = 6066) vs. post-ACA (2014, n = 7099) newly enrolled patients with SUD. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were employed to compare pre-ACA and post-ACA measures. Interviewees felt much uncertainty, but anticipated having to care for more SUD patients, who might have greater severity. Quantitative findings affirmed these expectations, with post-ACA SUD patients having higher rates of cannabis and amphetamine use disorders, and more psychiatric and medical conditions, compared to their pre-ACA counterparts. The post-ACA SUD cohort also had more Medicaid patients and greater enrollment in high-deductible plans. Post-ACA, SUD patients had more comorbidities as well as and more financial barriers to care. As federal healthcare policy continues to evolve, with potentially more restrictive coverage criteria, it is essential to continue examining how health systems adapt to changing health policy and its impact on SUD care. 01;193:124-130.

Prevalence and predictors of delayed clinical diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes: a longitudinal cohort study To examine the prevalence and person-level predictors of undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes among adults with elevated HbA1c values. We identified adults without diabetes who had a first elevated HbA1c (index HbA1c 48 mmol/mol; 6.5%) between January 2014 and December 2015, and classified them by Type 2 diabetes diagnosis status at 1 year following this result. Multilevel modelling techniques were used to examine the association of individual demographic, clinical, and utilization characteristics with remaining undiagnosed. We quantified differences in early Type 2 diabetes care between diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals. Of the 18 356 adults with a first elevated index HbA1c , 30.2% remained undiagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 1 year later. Individuals with lower index HbA1c values [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 5.95, 95% 95% CI 1.24-1.59; referent 50-59 years), (aOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.24-1.47; referent no prediabetes) had increased odds of remaining undiagnosed. After adjusting for age, race, and index HbA1c , remaining undiagnosed was associated with lower odds of initiating metformin (aOR 0.06, 95% CI 0.05-0.07). Almost one-third of adults with an elevated HbA1c value were not diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes within 1 year. Undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes, in turn, was associated with differences in early care. Strategies that leverage the electronic health record to facilitate earlier diagnosis may help reduce delays and allow for early intervention towards the goal of improved 12;35(12):1655-1662.

Central Obesity Increases the Risk of Gestational Diabetes Partially Through Increasing Insulin Resistance This study examined the associations of central obesity measures, waist to hip ratio (WHR) and waist circumference (WC), in early pregnancy with subsequent risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and evaluated the potential mediating role of insulin resistance markers. Within the prospective Pregnancy Environment and Lifestyle Study cohort of 1,750 women, WC and hip circumference were measured at gestational weeks 10 to 13. In a nested case-control study within the cohort, 115 GDM cases and 230 controls had fasting serum insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and adiponectin measurements at gestational weeks 16 to 19. Poisson and conditional logistic regression models were used, adjusting for established risk factors for GDM, including prepregnancy overweight or obesity. For A Obesity (Silver Spring). 2018 Nov 21. Advancing Health Policy and Program Research in Diabetes: Findings from the Natural Experiments for Translation in Diabetes (NEXT-D) Network To advance our understanding of the impacts of policies and programs aimed at improving detection, engagement, prevention, and clinical diabetes management in the USA, we synthesized findings from a network of studies that used natural experiments to evaluate diabetes health policies and programs. Studies from the Natural EXperiments for Translation in Diabetes (NEXT-D) network used rigorous longitudinal quasi-experimental study designs (e.g., interrupted time series) and analytical methods (e.g., difference-in-differences) to augment causal inference. Investigators partnered with health system stakeholders to evaluate whether glucose testing rates changed from before-to-after clinic interventions (e.g., integrating electronic screening decision prompts in New York City) or employer programs (e.g., targeted messaging and waiving copayments for at-risk employees). Other studies examined participation and behavior change in low- (e.g., wellness coaching) or high-intensity lifestyle modification programs (e.g., diabetes prevention program-like interventions) offered by payers or employers. Lastly, studies assessed how employer health insurance benefits impacted healthcare utilization, adherence, and outcomes among people with diabetes. NEXT-D demonstrated that low-intensity interventions to facilitate glucose testing and enhance engagement in lifestyle modification were associated with small improvements in weight but large improvements in screening and testing when supported by electronic health record-based decision-support. Regarding high-intensity diabetes prevention program-like lifestyle programs offered by payers or employers, enrollment was modest and led to weight loss and marginally lower short-term health expenditures. Health plans that incentivize patient behaviors were associated with increases in medication adherence. Meanwhile, shifting patients to high-deductible health plans was associated with no change in medication use and preventive screenings, but patients with diabetes delayed accessing healthcare for acute complications (e.g., cellulitis). Findings were more pronounced among lower-income patients, who experienced increased rates and acuity of emergency department visits for diabetes complications and other high-severity conditions. Findings from NEXT-D studies provide informative data that can guide programs and policies to facilitate detection, prevention, and treatment of diabetes in practice. 11 20;18(12):146.

BACKGROUND: Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing attention control training (ACT) and attention bias modification (ABM) in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have shown mixed results. The current RCT extends the extant literature by comparing the efficacy of ACT and a novel bias-contingent-ABM (BC-ABM), in which direction of training is contingent upon the direction of pre-treatment attention bias (AB), in a sample of civilian patients with PTSD. METHODS: Fifty treatment-seeking civilian patients with PTSD were randomly assigned to either ACT or BC-ABM. Clinician and self-report measures of PTSD and depression, as well as AB and attention bias variability (ABV), were acquired pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: ACT yielded greater reductions in PTSD and depressive symptoms on both clinician-rated and self-reported measures compared with BC-ABM. The BC-ABM condition successfully shifted ABs in the intended training direction. In the ACT group, there was no significant change in ABV or AB from pre- to post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The current RCT extends previous results in being the first to apply ABM that is contingent upon AB at pre-treatment. This personalized BC-ABM approach is associated with significant reductions in symptoms. However, ACT produces even greater reductions, thereby emerging as a promising treatment Epub 2018 Nov 12.

Examining the role of access to care: Racial/ethnic differences in receipt of resection for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer among integrated system members and non-members To examine the role of uniform access to care in reducing racial/ethnic disparities in receipt of resection for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by comparing integrated health system member patients to demographically similar non-member patients. Using data from the California Cancer Registry, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients from four racial/ethnic groups (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander), aged 21-80, with a first primary diagnosis of stage I or II NSCLC between 2004 and 2011, in counties served by Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) at diagnosis. Our cohort included 1565 KPNC member and 4221 non-member patients. To examine the relationship between race/ethnicity and receipt of surgery stratified by KPNC membership, we used modified Poisson regression to calculate risk ratios (RR) adjusted for patient demographic and tumor characteristics. Black patients were least likely to receive surgery regardless of access to integrated care (64-65% in both groups). The magnitude of the black-white difference in the likelihood of surgery receipt was similar for members members, roughly equal proportions of Hispanic and White patients received surgery; however, among non-members, Hispanic patients were less likely to surgical treatment for NSCLC were not reduced through integrated health system membership, suggesting that factors other than access to care (e.g., patient-provider communication) may underlie disparities. Future research should focus on identifying such modifiable 2018-09-11. Exploring how patients understand and assess their diabetes control Poor understanding of diabetes management targets is associated with worse disease outcomes. Patients may use different information than providers to assess their diabetes control. In this study, we identify the information patients use to gauge their current level of diabetes control and explore patient-perceived barriers to understanding the hemoglobin A1c value (HbA1c). Adults who self-reported a diagnosis of diabetes were recruited from outpatient, academically-affiliated, Internal Medicine clinics. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants and collected data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The mean age of the 25 participants was 56.8 years. HbA1c was one of several types of information participants used to assess diabetes control. Other information included perceived self-efficacy and adherence to self-care, the type and amount of medications taken, the presence or absence of symptoms attributed to diabetes, and feedback from self-monitoring of blood glucose. Most participants reported familiarity with the HbA1c (22 of 25), though understanding of the value's meaning varied significantly. Inadequate diabetes education and challenges with patient-provider communication were cited as common barriers to understanding the HbA1c. In addition to the HbA1c, several categories of information influenced participants' assessments of their diabetes control. Increased provider awareness of the factors that influence patients' perceptions of diabetes control can inform effective, patient-centered approaches for communicating vital diabetes-related information, facilitating behavior change towards improved patient outcomes. Department Patient Satisfaction with Treatment of Low-risk Pulmonary Embolism Many emergency department (ED) patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) who meet low-risk criteria may be eligible for a short length of stay (LOS) (<24 hours), with expedited discharge home either directly from the ED or after a brief observation or hospitalization. We describe the association between expedited discharge and site of discharge on care satisfaction and quality of life (QOL) among patients with low-risk PE (PE Severity Index [PESI] Classes I-III). This phone survey was conducted from September 2014 through April 2015 as part of a retrospective cohort study across 21 community EDs in Northern California. We surveyed low-risk patients with acute PE, treated predominantly with enoxaparin bridging and warfarin. All eligible patients were called 2-8 weeks after their index ED visit. PE-specific, patient-satisfaction questions addressed overall care, discharge instruction clarity, and LOS. We scored physical and mental QOL using a modified version of the validated Short Form Health Survey. Satisfaction and QOL were compared by LOS. For those with expedited discharge, we compared responses by site of discharge: ED vs. hospital, which included ED-based observation units. We used chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests as indicated. Survey response rate was 82.3% (424 of 515 eligible patients). Median age of respondents was 64 years; 47.4% were male. Of the 145 patients (34.2%) with a LOS<24 hours, 65 (44.8%) were discharged home from the ED. Of all patients, 89.6% were satisfied with their overall care and 94.1% found instructions clear. Sixty-six percent were satisfied with their LOS, whereas 17.5% would have preferred a shorter LOS and 16.5% a longer LOS. There were no significant differences in satisfaction between patients with LOS<24 hours vs. 24 hours (p>0.13 for all). Physical QOL scores were significantly higher for expedited-discharge patients (p=0.01). Patients with expedited discharge home from the ED vs. the hospital had no significant difference in satisfaction (p>0.20 for all) or QOL (p>0.19 for all). ED patients with low-risk PE reported high satisfaction with their care in follow-up surveys. Expedited discharge (<24 hours) and site of discharge were not associated with differences in patient satisfaction. Authors: Med. 2018 Nov;19(6):938-946. Epub 2018-10-18. Prospective Validation of a Standardized Ultrasonography-Based Ovarian Cancer Risk Assessment System To evaluate the performance of a system that standardizes ovarian cancer risk assessment and reporting on ultrasonography. We conducted a prospective community-based cohort study of average-risk women undergoing ultrasonography in 2016 using a reporting system that requires adnexal masses to be categorized as 1, 2, 3, or X based on standardized ultrasound criteria including size, presence of solid components, and vascularity assessed by Doppler. With a median follow-up of 18 months, the risk of ovarian cancer or borderline tumor diagnosis for each category was determined. Among 43,606 women undergoing ultrasonography, 6,838 (16%) had an abnormal adnexal reported: 70% were category 1, 21% category 2, 3.7% category 3, and 5.4% category X. Among these women, 89 (1.3%) were subsequently diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 59 (0.9%) with borderline tumors. The risks of ovarian cancer diagnosis associated with masses reported as categories 1, 2, 3, and X were 0.2% (95% 9.5-16.4%), respectively; risks of either ovarian cancer borderline tumor (95% 36,768 (84%) women with normal or benign adnexal findings reported, 38 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer, for a risk of 0.1% (95% CI 0.07-0.14%). In a community-based setting with low ovarian cancer prevalence, our standardized reporting system differentiated adnexal masses into four categories with distinct levels of risk with 9-10% of women having higher risk masses and 70% of women having masses associated with a risk of cancer similar to that of normal ultrasound findings. The system supports risk-based management by providing clinicians a more consistent assessment of risk based on ultrasound Impact of Eliminating Copayments for Tobacco Cessation Pharmacotherapy We examined the impact of the Affordable Care Act-mandated elimination of tobacco cessation pharmacotherapy (TCP) copayments on patient use of TCP, overall and by income. Electronic health record data captured any and combination (eg, nicotine gum plus patch) TCP use among adult smokers newly enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). KPNC eliminated TCP copayments in 2015. We included current smokers newly enrolled in the first 6 months of 2014 (before copayment elimination, N=16,199) or 2015 (after elimination, N=16,469). Multivariable models estimated 1-year changes in rates of any TCP fill, and of combination TCP fill, and tested for differences by income (<$50k, $50?75k, ?$75k). Through telephone surveys in 2016 with a subset of smokers newly enrolled in 2014 (n=306), we assessed barriers to TCP use, with results stratified by income. Smokers enrolled in KPNC in 2015 versus 2014 were more likely to have a TCP fill (9.1% vs. 8.2%; relative risk, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.27), and combination TCP fill, among those with any fill (42.3% vs. 37.9%; relative risk, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.23); findings were stronger for low-income smokers. Low-income patients (<$50k) were less likely to report that clinicians discussed smoking treatments with them (58%) compared with higher income smokers ($50?75k, 67%; ?$75k, 83%), and were less aware that free (40% vs. 53% and 69%, respectively, P-values<0.05). The Affordable Care Act's copayment elimination was associated with a modest increase in TCP use and a greater effect among low-income smokers. Uptake may have been enhanced if promoted to patients directly and via providers. Authors: Young-Wolff Med Care. 2018 11;56(11):912-918. Associations of ICU Capacity Strain with Disposition and Outcomes of Patients with Sepsis Presenting to the Emergency Department Intensive care unit (ICU) capacity strain refers to the potential limits placed on an ICU's ability to provide high-quality care for all patients who may need it at a given time. Few studies have investigated how fluctuations in ICU capacity strain might influence care outside the ICU. To determine whether ICU capacity strain is associated with initial level of inpatient care and outcomes for emergency department (ED) patients hospitalized for sepsis. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with sepsis admitted from the ED to a medical ward or ICU at three hospitals within the University of Pennsylvania Health System between 2012 and 2015. Patients were excluded if they required life support therapies, defined as invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support or vasopressors, at the time of admission. The exposures were four measures of ICU capacity strain at the time of the ED disposition decision: ICU occupancy, ICU turnover, ICU census acuity, and ward occupancy. The primary outcome was the decision to admit to a ward or to an ICU. Secondary analyses assessed the association of ICU capacity strain with in-hospital outcomes, including mortality. Among 77,142 hospital admissions from the ED, 3,067 patients met the study's eligibility criteria. The ICU capacity strain metrics varied between and within study hospitals over time. In unadjusted analyses, ICU occupancy, ICU turnover, ICU census acuity, and ward occupancy were all negatively associated with ICU admission. In the fully adjusted model including patient-level covariates, only ICU occupancy remained associated with ICU admission (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.79-0.96; P = 0.005), such that a 10% increase in ICU occupancy (e.g., one additional patient in a 10-bed ICU) was associated with a 13% decrease in the odds of ICU admission. Among the subset of patients admitted initially from the ED to a medical ward, ICU occupancy at the time of admission was associated with increased odds of hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-2.14; P = 0.001). The odds that patients in the ED with sepsis who do not require life support therapies will be admitted to the ICU are reduced when those ICUs experience high occupancy but not high levels of other previously explored measures of capacity strain. Patients with sepsis admitted to the wards during times of high ICU occupancy had increased odds of hospital mortality. Am Thorac Soc. 2018 11;15(11):1328-1335. Ensemble machine learning prediction of posttraumatic stress disorder screening status after emergency room hospitalization. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops in a substantial minority of emergency room admits. Inexpensive and accurate person-level assessment of PTSD risk after trauma exposure is a critical precursor to large-scale deployment of early interventions that may reduce individual suffering and societal costs. Toward this aim, we applied ensemble machine learning to predict PTSD screening status three months after severe injury using cost-effective and minimally invasive data. Participants (N = 271) were recruited at a Level 1 Trauma Center where they provided variables routinely collected at the hospital, including pulse, injury severity, and demographics, as well as psychological variables, including self-reported current depression, psychiatric history, and social support. Participant zip codes were used to extract contextual variables including population total and density, average annual income, and health insurance coverage rates from publicly available U.S. Census data. Machine learning yielded good prediction of PTSD screening status 3 months post-hospitalization, AUC = 0.85 95% CI [0.83, 0.86], and significantly outperformed all benchmark comparison models in a cross-validation procedure designed to yield an unbiased estimate of performance. These results demonstrate that good prediction can be attained from variables that individually have relatively weak predictive value, pointing to the promise of ensemble machine learning approaches that do not rely on strong isolated risk factors. 10.1016/j.janxdis.2018.10.004.

Mobile-accessible personal health records increase the frequency and timeliness of PHR use for patients with diabetes Personal health records (PHRs) offer patients a portal to view lab results, communicate with their doctors, and refill medications. Expanding PHR access to mobile devices could increase patients' engagement with their PHRs. We examined whether access to a mobile-optimized PHR changed the frequency and timeliness of PHR use among adult patients with diabetes in an integrated delivery system. Among patients originally using the PHR only by computer, PHR use frequency increased with mobile access. Non-White patients were more likely to view their lab results within 7 days if they had computer and mobile access compared with computer only; however, there were no statistically significant differences among White patients. More frequent and timely mobile access to PHR data and tools may lead to convenient and effective PHR engagement to support patient self-management. Future studies should evaluate whether PHR use with a mobile device is associated with changes in self-management and outcomes.

Understanding functional and social risk characteristics of frail older adults: a cross-sectional survey study Frailty is a condition of increasing importance, given the aging adult population. With an anticipated shortage of geriatricians, primary care physicians will increasingly need to manage care for frail adults with complex functional risks and social-economic circumstances. We used cross-sectional data from 4551 adults ages 65-90 who responded to the 2014/2015 cycle of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Member Health Survey (MHS), a self-administered survey that covers multiple health and social characteristics, to create a deficits accumulation model frailty index, classify respondents as frail or non-frail, and then compare prevalence of functional health issues including Activities of Daily Living (ADL)/Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) and social determinants of health (SDOHs) by frailty status. The overall prevalence of frailty was 14.3%, higher for women than men, increased with age, and more common among those with low levels of education and income. Frail older adults were more likely than non-frail to have 3 chronic diseases (55.9% vs. 10.1%), obesity (32.7% vs. 22.8%), insomnia (36.4% vs. 8.8%), oral health problems (25.1% vs. 4.7%), balance or walking problems (54.2% vs. 4.9%), 1 fall (56.1% vs. 19.7%), to use 1 medication known to increase fall risk (56.7% vs. 26.0%), and to need help with 2 ADLs (15.8% vs. 0.8%) and 2 IADLs (38.4% vs. 0.8%). They were more likely to feel financial strain (26.9% vs. 12.6%) and to use less medication than prescribed (7.4% vs. 3.6%), less medical care than needed (8.3% vs 3.7%), and eat less produce (9.5% vs. 3.2%) due to cost. Nearly 20% of frail adults were unpaid caregivers for an adult with frailty, serious illness or disability. This study examined the prevalence of frailty and identified modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors of health. The frail older adult population is heterogeneous and requires a patient-centered assessment of their circumstances by healthcare providers and caregivers to improve their quality of life, avoid adverse health events, and slow physical and mental decline. The characteristics identified in this study can be proactively used for the assessment of patient health, quality of life, and frailty prevention. Authors: Epub Prevalence of infant bronchiolitis-coded healthcare encounters attributable to RSV We sought to determine the proportion of bronchiolitis episodes attributable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) among ICD-9 coded infant bronchiolitis episodes which were tested for RSV. Bronchiolitis healthcare encounters were extracted from Kaiser Permanente Northern California databases for years 2006 to 2009. We used ICD-9 codes for bronchiolitis to capture bronchiolitis-related healthcare encounters including hospital admissions (Hospitalization), emergency department visits (EDV), and outpatient visits (OPV). We reported the monthly proportion of RSV-positive bronchiolitis episodes among tested bronchiolitis episodes. We used logistic regression to assess association between bronchiolitis episodes and patient demographic and health care characteristics. We also used logistic regression to assess association between decision to test and patient demographics and health care characteristics. Among 10,411 ICD-9 coded infant bronchiolitis episodes, 29% were RSV tested. Fifty one percent of those tested were RSV positive. Between December and February, and in infants 6 months, the proportion of bronchiolitis episodes that were attributable to RSV was 77.2% among hospitalized episodes, 78.3% among EDV episodes, and 60.9% among OPV episodes, respectively. The proportion of RSV-positive bronchiolitis episodes varied based upon infant age at diagnosis, level of health care service used, and time of the year of the episode. Estimation of the proportion of ICD-9 coded bronchiolitis episodes attributable to RSV is more specific when restricting to bronchiolitis episodes during peak months, younger infant age, and those requiring higher level of healthcare.

The Implementation of Performance Management Systems in U.S. Physician Organizations Performance management systems (PMSYS) aid in improving the quality and efficiency of care, but little is known about factors that influence more robust PMSYS among physician organizations. Using a nationally representative survey of U.S. medical practices, we examined the extent to which organizational capabilities and external factors were associated with more developed PMSYS. Linear regression estimated the relative impact of these factors on PMSYS. On average, practices implemented a minority (32 points out of 100) of the PMSYS processes assessed. Practices evaluated ( p < .01) or financially incentivized by external entities ( p < .01), receiving data from health plans ( p < .01), participating in an accountable care organization ( p < .01), affiliating with an independent practice association and/or physician-hospital organization ( p < .01), and using health information technology ( p < .01) and chronic disease registries ( p < .01) to greater degrees had more robust PMSYS.

Lagged effects of substance use on PTSD severity in a randomized controlled trial with modified prolonged exposure and relapse prevention. OBJECTIVE: To advance understanding of the effectiveness of evidence-based treatments for comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD), research must provide a more nuanced picture of how substance use affects change in PTSD symptoms over the course of treatments and whether prolonged exposure techniques can be efficacious during active substance use. A data set that included patients with PTSD/subthreshold-PTSD and SUD treated with an exposure-based intervention provided an opportunity to conduct a secondary analysis to test how patients' substance use impacted PTSD change over treatment. METHOD: We applied growth models to week-to-week PTSD symptom and substance use changes during treatment and follow-up of a randomized controlled trial of two cognitive-behavioral treatments for PTSD and SUD: Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and SUD Using Prolonged Exposure (COPE) and Relapse Prevention Therapy (RPT). Cross-lagged analyses were used to determine whether prior week substance use impacted subsequent PTSD symptom severity. RESULTS: Both treatments evidenced significant reductions in PTSD symptom severity. In the context of continued substance use, results suggest that individuals still benefit from exposure-based treatment. CONCLUSION: Results provide evidence that RPT and COPE both led to significant reductions in PTSD, providing further support that exposure-based techniques tailored for SUD can be conducted without jeopardizing PTSD or SUD outcomes. Implications for clinical decision making around treatment selection are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved). Reducing risk of Clostridium difficile infection and overall use of antibiotic in the outpatient treatment of urinary tract infection Risk of community-acquired Clostridium difficile infection (CA-CDI) following antibiotic treatment specifically for urinary tract infection (UTI) has not been evaluated. We conducted a nested case-control study at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, 2007-2010, to assess antibiotic prescribing and other factors in relation to risk of CA-CDI in outpatients with uncomplicated UTI. Cases were diagnosed with CA-CDI within 90 days of antibiotic use. We used matched controls and confirmed case-control eligibility through chart review. Antibiotics were classified as ciprofloxacin (most common), or low risk (nitrofurantoin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), moderate risk, or high risk (e.g. cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin) for CDI. We computed the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the relationship of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated UTI and history of relevant gastrointestinal comorbidity (including gastrointestinal diagnoses, procedures, and gastric acid suppression treatment) with risk of CA-CDI using logistic regression analysis. Despite the large population, only 68 cases were confirmed with CA-CDI for comparison with 112 controls. Female sex [81% of controls, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 6.3, CI 1.7-24), past gastrointestinal comorbidity (prevalence 39%, OR 2.3, CI nongastrointestinal comorbidity (prevalence 6%, OR 2.8, CI 1.4-5.6) were associated with increased CA-CDI risk. Compared with low-risk antibiotic, the adjusted ORs for antibiotic groups were as follows: ciprofloxacin, 2.7 (CI 1.0-7.2); moderate-risk antibiotics, 3.6 (CI 1.2-11); and high-risk antibiotics, 11.2 (CI 2.4-52). Lower-risk antibiotics should be used for UTI whenever possible, particularly in patients with a gastrointestinal comorbidity. However, UTI can be managed through alternative approaches. Research into the primary prevention of UTI is urgently needed. Authors: Mycobacterial Infection Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease prevalence is increasing. To determine the association between the use of inhaled corticosteroids and the likelihood of NTM pulmonary infection among individuals with treated airway disease. We conducted a case-control study of subjects with airway disease with and without NTM pulmonary infection (based on mycobacterial respiratory cultures) between 2000 and 2010 in northern California. We quantified the use of inhaled corticosteroids, other airway disease medications, and healthcare use within 6 months of NTM pulmonary infection identification. We used 1:10 case-control matching and conditional logistic regression to evaluate the association between the duration and cumulative dosage of inhaled corticosteroid use and NTM pulmonary infection. We identified 248 cases with NTM pulmonary infection with an estimated rate of 16.4 cases per 10,000 subjects treated for airway disease. The median interval between treated airway disease cohort entry (defined as date of patient filling the third airway disease treatment prescription) and NTM case identification was 1,217 days. Compared with control subjects, subjects with NTM pulmonary infection were more likely to use airway disease medications including systemic steroids; they were also more likely to use health care. Any inhaled corticosteroids use between 120 days and 2 years before cohort entry was associated with substantially increased odds of NTM infection. For example, the adjusted odds ratio for NTM infection among inhaled corticosteroid users in a 2-year interval was 2.51 (95% confidence interval, 1.40-4.49; P?0.01). Increasing cumulative inhaled corticosteroid dose was also associated with greater odds of NTM infection. Inhaled corticosteroid use, and particularly high-dose inhaled corticosteroid use, was associated with an increased risk of NTM pulmonary infection. 10;15(10):1169-1176. Review of Metformin Use for Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Prediabetes is prevalent and significantly increases lifetime risk of progression to type 2 diabetes. This review summarizes the evidence surrounding metformin use for type 2 diabetes prevention. Articles published between 1998 and 2017 examining metformin use for the primary indication of diabetes prevention available on MEDLINE. Forty articles met inclusion criteria and were summarized into four general categories: (1) RCTs of metformin use for diabetes prevention (n=7 and n=2 follow-up analyses); (2) observational analyses examining metformin use in heterogeneous subgroups of patients with prediabetes (n=9 from the Diabetes Prevention Program, n=1 from the biguanides and the prevention of the risk of obesity [BIGPRO] trial); (3) observational analyses examining cost effectiveness of metformin use for diabetes prevention (n=11 from the Diabetes Prevention Program, n=1 from the Indian Diabetes Prevention Program); and (4) real-world assessments of metformin eligibility or use for diabetes prevention (n=9). Metformin was associated with reduced relative risk of incident diabetes, with the strongest evidence for use in those at highest risk (i.e., aged <60 years, BMI 35, and women with histories of gestational diabetes). Metformin was also deemed cost effective in 11 economic analyses. Recent studies highlighted low rates of metformin use for diabetes prevention in real-world settings. Two decades of evidence support metformin use for diabetes prevention among higher-risk patients. However, metformin is not widely used in real-world practice, and enhancing the translation of this evidence to real-world practice has important implications for patients, providers, and 2018 10;55(4):565-574.

Traumatic brain injury associated with dementia risk among people with type 1 diabetes To examine the association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and dementia risk among a cohort of middle-aged and elderly individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We evaluated 4,049 members of an integrated health care system with T1D 50 years old between January 1, 1996, and September 30, 2015. Dementia and TBI diagnoses throughout the study period were abstracted from medical records. Cox proportional hazards models estimated associations between time-dependent TBI and dementia adjusting for demographics, HbA1c, nephropathy, neuropathy, stroke, peripheral artery disease, depression, and dysglycemic events. Fine and Gray regression models evaluated the association between baseline TBI and dementia risk accounting for competing risk of death. A total of 178 individuals (4.4%) experienced a TBI and 212 (5.2%) developed dementia. In fully adjusted models, TBI was associated with 3.6 times the dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR] 3.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.34, 5.68). When accounting for the competing risk of death, TBI was associated with almost 3 times the risk of dementia (HR 2.91; 95% CI 1.29, 5.68). This study demonstrates a marked increase in risk of dementia associated with TBI among middle-aged and elderly people with T1D. Given the complexity of self-care for individuals with T1D, and the comorbidities that predispose them to trauma and falls, future work is needed on interventions protecting brain health in this vulnerable population, which is now living to old changes amygdala and hippocampus resting-state functional connectivity in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with altered amygdala and hippocampal resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). However, less research has examined whether Prolonged Exposure (PE), a first line exposure-based treatment for PTSD, has the potential to alter resting state neural networks. METHODS: A total of 24 patients with PTSD and 26 matched trauma-exposed healthy controls (TEHCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline. PTSD patients were scanned a second time after completing 10-session PE in which patients narrated a detailed trauma account (imaginal exposure) and confronted trauma reminders (in vivo exposure) to extinguish trauma-related fear responses. TEHC were scanned again following a 10-week waiting period. Seed regions of interest (ROIs) included centromedial (CMA), versus pretreatment comparisons indicated increased rsFC of the BLA and CMA the orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus-medial prefrontal Enhanced rsFC with prefrontal regions PE could underlie improved capacity for inhibition and re-evaluation of threat, and heightened memory encoding and retrieval ability, respectively.

Long-term Glycemic Control and Dementia Risk in Type 1 Diabetes Individuals with type 1 diabetes have experienced an increase in life expectancy; yet, it is unknown what level of glycemic control is ideal for maintaining late-life brain health. We investigated the association of long-term glycemic control with dementia in older individuals with type 1 diabetes. We followed 3,433 members of a health care system with type 1 diabetes, ages 50 years, from 1996 to 2015. Repeated measurements of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), dementia diagnoses, and comorbidities were ascertained from health records. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to evaluate the association of time-varying glycemic exposure with dementia, with adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline health conditions, and frequency of HbA1c measurement. Over a mean follow-up of 6.3 years, 155 individuals (4.5%) were diagnosed with dementia. Patients with 50% of HbA1c measurements at 8-8.9% (64-74 mmol/mol) and 9% (75 mmol/mol) had 65% and 79% higher risk of dementia, respectively, compared with 2018 Sep 04. The Effect of Age and Comorbidities on the Association Between the Medicare STAR Oral Antihyperglycemic Adherence Metric and Glycemic Control The Medicare STAR program for Medicare Advantage Plans that include drug benefits provides monetary incentives for health plans to achieve good adherence to oral antihyperglycemic (OAH) agents but does not account for differential case mix that could affect the ability of health plans to achieve the required quality metrics. To determine whether OAH adherence varies by age and comorbidities among patients aged 65 years or older and the extent to which adherence affects glycemic control across age and comorbidity strata. We studied 54,480 patients with diabetes aged > 65 years from the Colorado, Northwest, and Northern California regions of Kaiser Permanente who received OAH agents but not insulin in 2010. We calculated adherence using the proportion of days covered (PDC) method. Per the STAR program, hemoglobin A1c < 8% defined good glycemic control. We also defined poor control as A1c > 9%. We used modified Poisson regression to identify predictors of adherence and to determine its effects on A1c across age and comorbidity strata, adjusting for sociodemographics and medication-related variables. The risk of being adherent to OAH declined moderately with an increasing number of comorbidities (risk ratio [RR] = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98-1.00 for 1 comorbidity and RR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.88-0.91 for 4 or more comorbidities). Adherence to OAH agents was associated with a 0%-3% increased risk of A1c < 8% across age and comorbidity categories, as well as a large decreased risk (RR = 0.55-0.73) of A1c > 9% for patients aged < 80 years or with < 3 comorbidities. Among patients with diabetes aged > 65 years, having multiple comorbidities affects adherence. Adherence reduces the risk of poor A1c control among patients aged 65-79 years or with 2 or fewer comorbidities. Our results suggest that health plan case mix minimally influenced the Medicare STAR OAH adherence metric, but it may affect glycemic control quality measures, especially if a HEDIS-like measure of poor control were adopted.

Language barriers and LDL-C/SBP control among Latinos with diabetes Language barriers in healthcare are associated with worse glycemic control among Latino patients with limited English proficiency and diabetes. We examined the association of patient-physician language concordance with lipid (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) control. Retrospective cohort study. Data were obtained from a survey and the electronic health records of Latino and white patients with diabetes receiving care within 1 integrated health plan with interpreter services available. Limited English proficiency and patient-physician language concordance were defined by patient report. Outcomes were poor lipid control (LDL-C >100 mg/dL) and poor SBP control (SBP >140 mm Hg). In total, 3463 Latino (2921 who spoke English and 542 who were limited English proficient [LEP]) and 3896 English-speaking white patients participated. One-third of the patients had poor lipid control and one-fifth had poor SBP control. English-speaking white patients were slightly less likely to have poor lipid control than English-speaking Latino patients, but the difference did not persist after adjustment for age and sex. Among Latinos, LEP patients were less likely to have poor lipid control than English-speaking patients (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.93), with no difference by LEP patient-physician language concordance. Poor SBP control did not differ by ethnicity, primary language, or patient-physician language concordance. We found no evidence that ethnicity or language barriers in healthcare were associated with poorer lipid or blood pressure control among Latino and white patients with diabetes receiving care in settings with professional interpreters.

Risk of Incident Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Events by Achieved Atherogenic Lipid Levels Among 62,428 Statin-Treated Individuals With Diabetes Mellitus relevance cholesterol (LDL-C) or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) goals for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) among patients with diabetes was assessed. This retrospective cohort study included patients with type 2 diabetes, age 21 to 90years, taking statins, with no history of ASCVD as of January 1, 2006, in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated healthcare delivery system. Multivariate cox models were utilized to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for incident ASCVD events by achieved LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels with adjustment for potential confounders. Incident ASCVD events were defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or coronary heart disease death. A cohort of 62,428 patients, with mean age of 64.1years, 46.9% women, and mean follow-up of 6.0 years, was identified. After adjustment, the risk of incident ASCVD for these statin-treated patients was monotonically lower with decreasing achieved LDL-C levels (p<0.0001 for trend) and non-HDL-C levels (p <0.0001 for trend). Relative to achieved LDL-C mg/dl, LDL-C mg/dl non-HDL-C = 0.59 (95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.68). In a large cohort of statin-treated diabetic patients without ASCVD, a monotonically lower risk of incident ASCVD events was associated with lower achieved lipid levels. These findings support the use of LDL-C ornon-HDL-C treatment goals for ASCVD primary prevention 09 01;122(5):762-767. Epub 2018-06-02. Association of behavioral health factors and social determinants of health with high and persistently high healthcare costs A high proportion of U.S. health care costs are attributable to a relatively small proportion of patients. Understanding behavioral and social factors that predict initial and persistent high costs for these \"high utilizers\" is critical for health policy-makers. This prospective observational study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated healthcare delivery system with 4.1 million members. A stratified random sample of high-cost vs. non-high-cost adult KPNC members matched by age, gender, race/ethnicity, type of health insurance, and medical severity (N = 378) was interviewed between 3/14/2013 and 3/20/2014. Data on health care costs and clinical diagnoses between 1/1/2008 and 12/31/2012 were derived from the electronic health record (EHR). Social-economic status, depression symptoms, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), interpersonal violence, financial stressors, neighborhood environment, transportation access, and patient activation and engagement were obtained through telephone interviews. Initial and subsequent high-cost status were defined as being classified in top 20% cost levels over 1/1/2009-12/31/2011 and 1/1/2012-12/31/2012, respectively. Psychiatric diagnosis (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.52-4.29, p < 0.001), financial stressors (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.19-3.26, p = 0.009), and ACEs (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00-1.20, p = 0.051) predicted initial high-cost status. ACEs alone predicted persistent high-cost status in the subsequent year (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00-1.25, p = 0.050). Non-medical factors such as psychiatric problems, financial stressors and adverse childhood experiences contribute significantly to the likelihood of high medical utilization and cost. Efforts to predict and reduce high utilization must include measuring and potentially addressing these factors. Authors: Sterling Sep;11:154-159. Epub 2018-06-27. Which Complex Patients Should Be Referred for Intensive Care Management? A Mixed-Methods Analysis A large and increasing proportion of health care costs are spent caring for a small segment of medically and socially complex patients. To date, it has been difficult to identify which patients are best served by intensive care management. To characterize factors that best identify which complex patients are most suited for intensive care management. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 35 care managers (CMs; 10 licensed social workers and 25 registered nurses) working in intensive care management programs within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) outpatient medical centers. We asked CMs to review a randomly selected list of up to 50 patients referred to them in the prior year and to categorize each patient as either (1) \"good candidates\" for care management, (2) \"not needing\" intensive care management, or (3) \"needing more\" than traditional care management could provide. We then conducted semi-structured interviews to understand how CMs separated patients into these three groups. CMs assigned 1178 patients into the 3 referral categories. Less than two thirds (62%, n = 736) of referred patients were considered good candidates, with 18% (n = 216) categorized as not needing care management and 19% (n = 226) as needing more. Compared to the other two categories, good candidates were older (76.2 years vs. 73.2 for not needing and 69.8 for needing more, p < 0.001), prescribed more medications (p = 0.02) and had more prior year outpatient visits (p = 0.04), while the number of prior year hospital and emergency room admissions were greater than not needing but less than needing more (p < 0.001). A logistic regression model using available electronic record data predicted good candidate designation with a c statistic of 0.75. Several qualitative themes emerged that helped define appropriateness for referral, including availability of social support, patient motivation, non-medical transitions, recent trajectory of medical condition, and psychiatric or substance use issues. Many apparently complex patients are not good candidates for intensive care management. Current electronic medical records do not capture several of the most salient characteristics that determine appropriateness for care management. Our findings suggest that systematic collection of social support, patient motivation, and recent non-medically related life change information may help identify which complex patients are most likely to benefit from care management.

Collaborative research and actions on both sides of the US-Mexico border to counteract type 2 diabetes in people of Mexican origin. BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is now a massive epidemic in both California and Mexico, with serious consequences for social and economic well-being. A large proportion of these populations share common ethnic backgrounds. Yet diverse environmental and social conditions across regions create unique opportunities to explore the ways that T2D risk, incidence, management and outcomes manifest. MAIN TEXT: An action-oriented research consortium headed up by the University of California and Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico was constituted to set priorities for bi-national translational research, in an attempt to implement and evaluate clinical, public health and policy actions to decrease the burden of T2D for people of Mexican origin. In this paper, we describe the epidemiology of T2D in Mexico and California, review current efforts to combat the epidemic, highlight gaps in knowledge and identify urgent areas of opportunity for collaboration. The group has developed a common research agenda and funding has been obtained to evaluate biological samples from the 2016 Mexican Health Survey, collaborate in a telemedicine-based retinopathy project, implement interventions in food banks, promote a communications campaign, and design a large-scale diabetes prevention effectiveness trial. CONCLUSIONS: T2D has caused a state of emergency in Mexico and is a major health problem among Mexican populations on both sides of the border. Understanding the commonalities and differences between California and Mexico for those of Mexican origin with respect to T2D, when combined with a sharing of knowledge and advances, can produce a bi-national translational research agenda to inform relevant policy and practice. Amidst economic and political uncertainty and limited healthcare budgets, this collaboration can contribute to the development of scientific evidence to inform policies and interventions. This may provide a promising collaborative model that could be expanded to other health conditions and regions of the 10.1186/s12992-018-0390-5.

Diagnosis-based cohort augmentation using laboratory results data: The case of chronic kidney disease In this report, we use data from FDA's Sentinel System to focus on how augmenting a diagnosis-based chronic kidney disease cohort with patients identified through laboratory results impacts cohort characteristics and outcomes. We used data from 2 Data Partners. Patients were eligible if they were health plan members on January 1, 2012. We classified chronic kidney disease patients into mutually exclusive categories according to the hierarchy of (1) ICD-9-CM diagnosis (DXGroup), or (2) two estimated glomerular filtration rates <60 mL/min/1.73m2 , separated by at least 90 days (2-LabGroup), or (3) a single estimated glomerular filtration rates <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (1-LabGroup). We compared the groups on demographic, clinical, and health care utilization characteristics using pairwise standardized differences. We used Cox regression to compare the groups on mortality, adjusting for baseline covariates. We identified 209 864 patients: 107 607 in DxGroup (51%) and 102 257 (49%) from laboratory data alone. For every characteristic, the DxGroup was the sickest, followed by the 2-LabGroup and then the 1-LabGroup. The DxGroup was more likely to die than 2-LabGroup (hazard ratio [HR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.22-1.77) at Site 1; that effect was observed, but attenuated, at Site 2 (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.07-1.25). The DxGroup was more likely to die than the 1-LabGroup at Site 1 (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.20-1.55), but not at Site 2 (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-1.00). We suggest that drug safety researchers consider whether the method of cohort identification contributes to generalizability of safety Immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery: surgeon preferences and concerns We surveyed cataract surgeons to gain insight into their perceptions of and attitudes about immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). Cross-sectional. All active cataract surgeons in Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2016. Online survey that asked cataract surgeons why they did or did not perform ISBCS, their interest in offering ISBCS, concerns about the procedure, and desired supports. Of the 165 active cataract surgeons, 107 (65%) participated in the survey, of whom 92 (86%) responded that they currently practiced ISBCS and 15 (14%) reported that they did not. For ISBCS surgeons, patient convenience (95%) and patient request (91%) were the top reasons for performing the procedure. For surgeons who do not perform ISBCS, the most commonly cited concerns were not having the postoperative refractive outcome from the first eye to guide intraocular lens selection in the second eye (80%) and risk of bilateral vision loss (73%). Among those who do not perform ISBCS, 9 (60%) identified the need for evidence-based patient selection criteria to support a decision to adopt the procedure. In addition, many surgeons in both groups wanted streamlined patient education materials and established protocols. Patient centeredness is a key construct of contemporary health care delivery, and in an era of low complication risk, many patients request ISBCS; the number of these surgeries has increased. In our capitated health care system, the great majority of surgeons perform ISBCS for the convenience of their patients. Providing surgeons with guidelines and tools to support ISBCS likely would increase Eating with others and meal location are differentially associated with nutrient intake by sex: The Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) Though eating with others is often a social behavior, relationships between social contexts of eating and nutrient intake have been underexplored. This study evaluates how social aspects of eating - frequencies of eating meals with others, meals prepared at home, and meals outside the home - are associated with nutrient intake. Because diet improvement can reduce complications of diabetes mellitus, we surveyed a multi-ethnic cohort of persons with type 2 diabetes (n = 770) about social aspects of diet (based on 24-hour recalls). Sex-stratified multiple regression analyses adjusted for confounders assessed the relationship between frequency of eating with others and nutrient intake (total energy, energy from fat, energy from carbohydrates, Healthy Eating Index/HEI, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension/DASH score). Although there was slight variation in men's versus women's propensity to share meals, after adjustment for confounders, there was no consistently significant association between meals with others and the 5 nutrient intake measures for either men or women. The directions of association between categories of eating with others and diet quality (HEI and DASH scores) - albeit not significant - were different for men (positive) and women (mostly negative), which warrants further investigation. The next analyses estimated nutrient intake associated with meals prepared at home, and meals consumed outside the home. Analyses indicated that greater meal frequency at home was associated with significantly better scores on diet quality indices for men (but not women), while meal frequency outside the home was associated with poorer diet quality and energy intake for women (but not men). Better measurement of social dimensions of eating may inform ways to improve nutrition, especially for persons with diabetes for whom diet improvement can result in better disease outcomes. 2018-03-27. Association Initiation of Basal Insulin Analogs vs Neutral Protamine Hagedorn Insulin With Hypoglycemia-Related Emergency Department Visits or Hospital Admissions and With Glycemic Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes In clinical trials of patients with type 2 diabetes, long-acting insulin analogs modestly reduced the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with human neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, but cost 2 to 10 times more. Outcomes in clinical practice may differ from trial results. To compare the rates of hypoglycemia-related emergency department (ED) visits or hospital admissions associated with initiation of long-acting insulin analogs vs human NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. A retrospective observational study using data from Kaiser Permanente of Northern California from January 1, 2006, through September 30, 2015. Patients with type 2 diabetes who initiated a long-acting insulin analog or NPH insulin were included and censored at death, loss of health plan coverage, change in insulin treatment, or study end on September 30, 2015. Initiation of basal insulin analogs (glargine or detemir) vs NPH insulin. The primary outcome was the time to a hypoglycemia-related ED visit or hospital admission and the secondary outcome was the change in hemoglobin A1c level within 1 year of insulin initiation. There were 25 489 patients with type 2 diabetes who initiated basal insulin therapy (mean age, 60.2 [SD, 46.8% female). During follow-up of 1.7 years, there were 39 hypoglycemia-related ED visits or hospital admissions among 1928 patients who initiated insulin analogs (11.9 events [95% CI, 8.1 to 15.6] per 1000 person-years) compared with 354 hypoglycemia-related ED visits or hospital admissions among 23 561 patients who initiated NPH insulin (8.8 events [95% CI, 7.9 to 9.8] per 1000 person-years) (between-group difference, 3.1 events [95% CI, -1.5 to 7.7] per 1000 person-years; P = .07). Among 4428 patients matched by propensity score, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.71 to 1.78) for hypoglycemia-related ED visits or hospital admissions associated with insulin analog use. Within 1 year of insulin initiation, hemoglobin A1c level decreased from 9.4% (95% CI, 8.2% glycemic control, -0.22% [95% CI, -0.09% to -0.37%]). Among patients with type 2 diabetes, initiation of a basal insulin analog compared with NPH insulin was not associated with a reduced risk of hypoglycemia-related ED visits or hospital admissions or with improved glycemic control. These findings suggest that the use of basal insulin analogs in usual practice settings may not be associated with clinical advantages for these outcomes. Authors: Lipska 2018 07 03;320(1):53-62. Influence of a New Diabetes Diagnosis on the Health Behaviors of the Patient's Partner When a person is given a diagnosis of diabetes, the changes in his or her health behaviors may influence the behaviors of his or her partner. The diabetes diagnosis may affect household members' perceptions of their own health risks, which could trigger behavioral change. The purpose of this study was to assess whether partners of persons with newly diagnosed diabetes changed their health behaviors compared with partners of persons without diabetes. The study population consisted of Kaiser Permanente Northern California health plan members from 2007 to 2011. This cohort study assessed differences in change of 8 health behaviors. The study compared coresiding partners of persons with newly diagnosed diabetes before and after a diabetes diagnosis with a 5 to 1 matched sample of coresiding partners of persons without diabetes. A total of 180,910 couples were included in the analysis. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, partners of persons with newly diagnosed diabetes had significantly higher rates of participation in weight management-related health education classes (risk ratio [RR] = 1.50; 95% CI, 1.39-1.63); smoking cessation medication use (RR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.05-1.50); glucose screening (RR = 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.08); clinically meaningful weight loss (RR = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.11); lipid screening (RR = 1.05; 95% 1.04-1.07); influenza vaccination (RR = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04); and blood pressure screening (RR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03) compared with partners of persons without diabetes. There were small but significant differences in health-related behavioral changes among partners of persons with newly diagnosed diabetes compared with partners of persons without diabetes, even when no intervention occurred. This finding suggests a diabetes diagnosis within a family may be a teachable moment to improve health behaviors at the household level.

Risk Adjustment for Hospital Characteristics Reduces Unexplained Hospital Variation in Pressure Injury Risk Research investigating risk factors for hospital-acquired pressure injury (HAPI) has primarily focused on the characteristics of patients and nursing staff. Limited data are available on the association of hospital characteristics with HAPI. We aimed to quantify the association of hospital characteristics with HAPI and their effect on residual hospital variation in HAPI risk. We employed a retrospective cohort study design with split validation using hierarchical survival analysis. This study extends the analysis \"Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injury (HAPI): Risk Adjusted Comparisons in an Integrated Healthcare Delivery System\" by Rondinelli et al. (2018) to include hospital-level factors. We analyzed 1,661 HAPI episodes among 728,266 adult hospitalization episodes across 35 California Kaiser Permanente hospitals, an integrated healthcare delivery system between January 1, 2013, and June 30, 2015. After adjusting for patient-level and hospital-level variables, 2 out of 12 candidate hospital variables were statistically significant predictors of HAPI. The hazard for HAPI decreased by 4.8% for every 0.1% increase in a hospital's mean mortality ([6.3%, 2.6%], p < .001), whereas every 1% increase in a hospital's proportion of patients with a history of diabetes increased HAPI hazard by 5% ([-0.04%, 10.0%], p = .072). Addition of these hierarchical variables decreased unexplained hospital variation of HAPI risk by 35%. We found hospitals with higher patient mortality had lower HAPI risk. Higher patient mortality may decrease the pool of patients who live to HAPI occurrence. Such hospitals may also provide more resources (specialty staff) to care for frail patient populations. Future research should aim to combine hospital data sets to overcome power limitations at the hospital level and should investigate additional measures of structure and process related to HAPI Jul/Aug;67(4):314-323.

The Relationship Between Prescription Copayments and Contraceptive Adherence in a New-user Cohort Contraceptive nonadherence is an important contributor to unintended pregnancy in the United States. While the elimination of patient cost sharing has been cited as means to improve contraceptive access, little is known about the relationship between cost sharing and ongoing adherence and continuation of chosen methods. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between copayment amount and adherence to pharmacy-dispensed contraception in young women. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 39,142 women ages 19-29 with a new prescription for the contraceptive pill, patch, or ring at Kaiser Permanente Northern California during 2011-2014. We examined 12-month nonadherence as measured by timely prescription refills and used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association between copayment amount and the risk of nonadherence. Ninety-four percent of women used the pill, and 6% used the patch or ring. Forty percent of patients had no copayment and 25% had a copayment of $30. Nearly 75% of women were nonadherent during the study period. In 2013 and 2014, women with a copayment had a 9% increased risk of nonadherence (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.04, 1.14) compared with women with no copayment. Prescription copayments may serve as a barrier to adherence of pharmacy-dispensed contraception. Given recent changes to Affordable Care Act contraceptive coverage requirement, these findings can be used to support state-level and health system-level policies for no-cost contraception, and to determine the potential public health impact of this policy change. 07;56(7):577-582.

Outpatient Management of Emergency Department Patients With Acute Pulmonary Embolism: Variation, Patient Characteristics, and Outcomes Outpatient management of emergency department (ED) patients with acute pulmonary embolism is uncommon. We seek to evaluate the facility-level variation of outpatient pulmonary embolism management and to describe patient characteristics and outcomes associated with home discharge. The Management of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (MAPLE) study is a retrospective cohort study of patients with acute pulmonary embolism undertaken in 21 community EDs from January 2013 to April 2015. We gathered demographic and clinical variables from comprehensive electronic health records and structured manual chart review. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between patient characteristics and home discharge. We report ED length of stay, consultations, 5-day pulmonary embolism-related return visits and 30-day major hemorrhage, recurrent venous thromboembolism, and all-cause mortality. Of 2,387 patients, 179 were discharged home (7.5%). Home discharge varied significantly between EDs, from 0% to 14.3% (median 7.0%; interquartile range 4.2% to 10.9%). Median length of stay for home discharge patients (excluding those who arrived with a new pulmonary embolism diagnosis) was 6.0 hours (interquartile range 4.6 to 7.2 hours) and 81% received consultations. On adjusted analysis, ambulance arrival, abnormal vital signs, syncope or presyncope, deep venous thrombosis, elevated cardiac biomarker levels, and more proximal emboli were inversely associated with home discharge. Thirteen patients (7.2%) who were discharged home had a 5-day pulmonary embolism-related return visit. Thirty-day major hemorrhage and recurrent venous thromboembolism were uncommon and similar between patients hospitalized and those discharged home. All-cause 30-day mortality was lower in the home discharge group (1.1% versus 4.4%). Home discharge of ED patients with acute pulmonary embolism was uncommon and varied significantly between facilities. Patients selected for outpatient management had a low incidence of adverse outcomes. Authors: Vinson DR; Ballard DW; Reed al. Ann Emerg Med. 2018 07;72(1):62-72.e3. Epub 2017-12-13. Adherence to Cardio-protective Medications Prescribed for Secondary Prevention after an Acute Coronary Syndrome Hospitalization Compared to Usual Care Secondary prevention after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) hospitalization is critical to prevent additional morbidity and mortality. While poor adherence to prescribed cardio-protective medications is a known problem;1;2 it is unknown whether an ACS event might motivate patients to achieve better adherence. In a large integrated health care population; we examined initiation and adherence to newly prescribed cardio-protective medications among post-ACS event patients compared to patients who were prescribed these same medications in usual care.Strengths of this study include the large cohort with 12-15 months of follow-up and a robust adherence methodology based on pharmacy dispensing records in this closed health care system. We did not assess adherence to aspirin, an essential medication for this patient population, because it is often obtained over-the-counter and thus not reliably measurable from pharmacy dispensing.Adherence to newly prescribed cardio-protective medications was excellent among ACS patients discharged from the hospital, and substantially better than patients prescribed the same medications in usual care, suggesting that experiencing an ACS event may motivate patients to be more adherent to medications prescribed at discharge than they might be in usual care. However, despite having had an ACS event, and although better adherence than a similar, previously reported study,4 adherence over time among ACS patients remained suboptimal.Our study in a large real world contemporary population illustrates that post-ACS medication adherence was much better than that observed among patients receiving the same medications in usual care, perhaps due to motivation conferred by the ACS event itself. Nonetheless, medication adherence was suboptimal even in ACS patients, limiting the potential benefits of these proven treatments. Multifactorial interventions that address the various psychosocial, socioeconomic, and behavioral patient barriers are needed to improve adherence in these high-risk patients.

Stereoscopic 3D gives the viewer the same shape, size, perspective and depth they would experience viewing the real world and could mimic the perceptual threat cues present in real life. This is the first study to investigate whether an immersive stereoscopic 3D video exposure-based treatment would be effective in reducing fear of spiders. Participants with a fear of spiders (N=77) watched two psychoeducational videos with facts about spiders and phobias. They were then randomized to a treatment condition that watched a single session of a stereoscopic 3D immersive video exposure-based treatment (six 5-min exposures) delivered through a virtual reality headset or a psychoeducation only control condition that watched a 30-min neutral video (2D documentary) presented on a computer monitor. Assessments of spider fear (Fear of Spiders Questionnaire [FSQ], Behavioral Approach Task [BAT], & subjective ratings of fear) were completed pre- and post-treatment. Consistent with prediction, the stereoscopic 3D video condition outperformed the control condition in reducing fear of spiders showing a large between-group effect size on the FSQ (Cohen's d=0.85) and a medium between-group effect size on the BAT (Cohen's d=0.47). This provides initial support for stereoscopic 3D video doi: 10.1016/j.janxdis.2018.05.006. Epub 2018 Jun 4. Improved Cardiovascular Risk Factors Control Associated with a Large-Scale Population Management Program Among Diabetes Patients Optimal cardiovascular risk factors control among individuals with diabetes remains a challenge. We evaluated changes in glucose, lipid, and blood pressure control among diabetes patients after implementation of a large-scale population management program, known as Preventing Heart Attacks and Strokes Everyday, at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), during 2004-2013. We used National Committee for Quality Assurance Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set cut points to identify prevalence of poor glycemic (hemoglobin A1c > 9%) control, good lipid control (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 100 mg/dL), and good blood pressure control (blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg) in each year (N range = 98,345 to 122,177 over the entire period). We assessed trends in risk factor control based on Joinpoint regression and average annual percentage change (AAPC) compared with published National Committee for Quality Assurance Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set commercial rates. We found that the prevalence of poor glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c > 9%) declined in both KPNC and nationally, but was statistically significant only in KPNC (AAPC = -4.8; P < .05). The prevalence of good lipid control (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 100 mg/dL) increased significantly in to 71%; AAPC = +4.3; P < .05), but there was no significant improvement nationally (40% to 44%; AAPC = +1.4; P = .2). The prevalence of blood pressure control (<140/90 mm Hg) was higher in KPNC (77% to 82%; AAPC = 62%; AAPC = +1.9; P < .05) during the reported years 2007-2013. Relative to national benchmarks, a substantially greater improvement in risk factor control among adults with diabetes was observed after implementation of a comprehensive population management program.

Food Insecurity, Food \"Deserts,\" and Glycemic Control in Patients With Diabetes: A Longitudinal Analysis Both food insecurity (limited food access owing to cost) and living in areas with low physical access to nutritious foods are public health concerns, but their relative contribution to diabetes management is poorly understood. This was a prospective cohort study. A random sample of patients with diabetes in a primary care network completed food insecurity assessment in 2013. Low physical food access at the census tract level was defined as no supermarket within 1 mile in urban areas and 10 miles in rural areas. HbA1c measurements were obtained from electronic health records through November 2016. The relationship among food insecurity, low physical food access, and glycemic control (as defined by HbA1c) was analyzed using hierarchical linear mixed models. Three hundred and ninety-one participants were followed for a mean of 37 months. Twenty percent of respondents reported food insecurity, and 31% resided in an area of low physical food access. In adjusted models, food insecurity was associated with higher HbA1c (difference of 95% CI 0.4-0.8 [4.4-8.7], P < 0.0001), which did not improve over time (P = 0.50). Living in an area with low physical food access was not associated with a difference in HbA1c (difference 0.2% [2.2 mmol/mol], 95% to 5.6], P = 0.33) or with change over time (P = 0.07). Food insecurity is associated with higher HbA1c, but living in an area with low physical food access is not. Food insecurity screening and interventions may help improve glycemic control 2018 06;41(6):1188-1195. Epub 2018-03-19. The Impact of Acute Organ Dysfunction on Long-Term Survival in Sepsis To estimate the impact of each of six types of acute organ dysfunction (hepatic, renal, coagulation, neurologic, cardiac, and respiratory) on long-term mortality after surviving sepsis hospitalization. Multicenter, retrospective study. Twenty-one hospitals within an integrated healthcare delivery system in Northern California. Thirty thousand one hundred sixty-three sepsis patients admitted through the emergency department between 2010 and 2013, with mortality follow-up through April 2015. None. Acute organ dysfunction was quantified using modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. The main outcome was long-term mortality among sepsis patients who survived hospitalization. The estimates of the impact of each type of acute organ dysfunction on long-term mortality were based on adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Sensitivity analyses were conducted based on propensity score-matching and adjusted logistic regression. Hospital mortality was 9.4% and mortality was 31.7% at 1 year. Median follow-up time among sepsis survivors was 797 days (interquartile range: 384-1,219 d). Acute neurologic (odds ratio, 1.86; p < 0.001), respiratory (odds ratio, 1.43; p < 0.001), and cardiac (odds ratio, 1.31; p < 0.001) dysfunction were most strongly associated with short-term hospital mortality, compared with sepsis patients without these organ dysfunctions. Evaluating only patients surviving their sepsis hospitalization, acute neurologic dysfunction was also most strongly associated with long-term mortality (odds ratio, 1.52; p < 0.001) corresponding to a marginal increase in predicted 1-year mortality of 6.0% for the presence of any neurologic dysfunction (p < 0.001). Liver dysfunction was also associated with long-term mortality in all models, whereas the association for other organ dysfunction subtypes was inconsistent between models. Acute sepsis-related neurologic dysfunction was the organ dysfunction most strongly associated with short- and long-term mortality and represents a key mediator of long-term adverse outcomes following sepsis.

A Two-Step Method to Identify Positive Deviant Physician Organizations of Accountable Care Organizations with Robust Performance Management Systems To identify positive deviant (PD) physician organizations of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) with robust performance management systems (PMSYS). Third National Survey of Physician Organizations (NSPO3, n = 1,398). Organizational and external factors from NSPO3 were analyzed. Linear regression estimated the association of internal and contextual factors on PMSYS. Two cutpoints (75th/90th percentiles) identified PDs with the largest residuals and highest PMSYS scores. A total of 65 and 41 PDs were identified using 75th and 90th percentiles cutpoints, respectively. The 90th percentile more strongly differentiated PDs from non-PDs. Having a high proportion of vulnerable patients appears to constrain PMSYS development. Our PD identification method increases the likelihood that PD organizations selected for in-depth inquiry are high-performing organizations that System Blockers in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study In individuals with diabetes, the comparative effectiveness of add-on antihypertensive medications added to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker on the risk of significant kidney events is unknown. We used an observational, multicenter cohort of 21,897 individuals with diabetes to compare individuals who added -blockers, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, loop enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. We examined the hazard of significant kidney events, cardiovascular events, and death using Cox proportional hazard models with propensity score weighting. The composite significant kidney event end point was defined as the first occurrence of a 30% decline in eGFR to an eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, initiation of dialysis, or kidney transplant. The composite cardiovascular event end point was defined as the first occurrence of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or congestive heart failure; coronary artery bypass grafting; or percutaneous coronary intervention, and it was only examined in those free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Over a maximum of 5 years, there were 4707 significant kidney events, 1498 deaths, and 818 cardiovascular events. Compared with thiazide diuretics, hazard ratios for significant kidney events for -blockers, calcium channel blockers, and loop diuretics to 0.78), and 1.19 (95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.41), respectively. Compared with thiazide diuretics, hazard ratios of mortality for -blockers, calcium channel blockers, and loop diuretics were 1.19 (95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.44), 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.03), and 1.67 (95% confidence interval, 1.31 to 2.13), respectively. Compared with thiazide diuretics, hazard ratios of cardiovascular events for -blockers, calcium channel blockers, and loop diuretics compared with thiazide diuretics were 1.65 (95% confidence interval, to 1.96), (95% confidence interval, 0.80 to 1.39), and 1.55 (95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 2.27), respectively. Compared with thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers were associated with a lower risk of significant kidney events and a similar risk of cardiovascular events. Authors: Schroeder 2018-03-23. Impact of emergency physician-provided patient education about alternative care venues Interventions that focus on educating patients appear to be the most effective in directing healthcare utilization to more appropriate venues. We sought to evaluate the effects of mailed information and a brief scripted educational phone call from an emergency physician (EP) on subsequent emergency department (ED) utilization by low-risk adults with a recent treat-and-release ED visit. Patients were randomized into 3 groups for post-ED follow-up: EP phone call with mailed information, mailed information only, and no educational intervention. Each intervention group was compared with a set of matched controls. We undertook this study in 6 EDs within an integrated healthcare delivery system. Overall, 9093 patients were identified; the final groups were the phone group (n = 609), mail group (n = 771), and matched control groups for each (n = 1827 and n = 1542, respectively). Analysis was stratified by age (<65 and 65 years). Patients were educated about available venues of care delivery for their future medical needs. The primary outcome was the rate of 6-month ED utilization after the intervention compared with the 6-month utilization rate preceding the intervention. Compared with matched controls, subsequent ED utilization decreased by 22% for patients 65 years or older in the phone group (P = .04) and by 27% for patients younger than 65 years in the mail group (P = .03). ED utilization subsequent to a low-acuity ED visit decreased after a brief post-ED education intervention by an EP explaining alternative venues of care for future medical needs. Response to the method of communication (phone vs mail) varied significantly by patient age. Authors: Patel PB; Care. 2018 05;24(5):225-231. Acute Pulmonary Embolism in Emergency Department Patients Despite Therapeutic Anticoagulation Emergency department (ED) patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) despite therapeutic anticoagulation at the time of diagnosis are uncommonly encountered and present a diagnostic and management challenge. Their characterization and outcomes are poorly described. We sought to describe the prevalence and characteristics of therapeutically anticoagulated patients among a population of patients with acute PE in a community setting and to describe treatment changes and 30-day outcomes. From a large retrospective cohort of adults with acute, objectively-confirmed PE across 21 EDs between 01/2013 and 04/2015, we identified patients who arrived on direct oral or injectable anticoagulants, or warfarin with an initial ED international normalized ratio (INR) value 2.0. Patients were excluded from the larger cohort if they had received a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the prior 30 days. We gathered demographic and clinical variables from electronic health records and structured manual chart review. We report discharge anticoagulation regimens and major 30-day adverse outcomes. Among 2,996 PE patients, 36 (1.2%) met study criteria. Mean age was 63 years. Eleven patients (31%) had active cancer and 25 (69%) were high risk on the PE Severity Index (Classes III-V), comparable to the larger cohort (p>0.1). Reasons for pre-arrival anticoagulation were VTE treatment or prevention (n=21), and atrial fibrillation or flutter (n=15). All patients arrived on warfarin and one was also on enoxaparin: 32 had a therapeutic INR (2.0-3.0) and four had a supratherapeutic INR (>3.0). (42%) had at least one subtherapeutic INR (<2.0) in the 14 days preceding their diagnostic visit. Two patients died during hospitalization. Of the 34 ultimately discharged, 22 underwent a change in anticoagulation drug or dosing, 19 of whom received injectables, either to replace or to supplement warfarin. Four patients also received inferior vena cava filters. Thirty-day outcomes included one major hemorrhage and one additional death. No patients experienced recurrent or worsening VTE. We found a low prevalence of therapeutic anticoagulation at the time of acute PE diagnosis. Most patients with breakthrough PE underwent a change in therapy, though management varied widely. Subtherapeutic anticoagulation levels in the preceding weeks were common and support the importance of anticoagulation adherence. Authors: Liu Med. 2018 May;19(3):510-516. Epub 2018-04-06. Identifying Geographic Disparities in Diabetes Prevalence Among Adults and Children Using Emergency Claims Data Geographic surveillance can identify hotspots of disease and reveal associations between health and the environment. Our study used emergency department surveillance to investigate geographic disparities in type 1 and type 2 diabetes prevalence among adults and children. Using all-payer emergency claims data from 2009 to 2013, we identified unique New York City residents with diabetes and geocoded their location using home addresses. Geospatial analysis was performed to estimate diabetes prevalence by New York City Census tract. We also used multivariable regression to identify neighborhood-level factors associated with higher diabetes prevalence. We estimated type 1 and type 2 diabetes prevalence at 0.23% and 10.5%, respectively, among adults and 0.20% and 0.11%, respectively, among children in New York City. Pediatric type 1 diabetes was associated with higher income (P = 0.001), whereas adult type 2 diabetes was associated with lower income (P < 0.001). Areas with a higher proportion of nearby restaurants categorized as fast food had a higher prevalence of all types of diabetes (P < 0.001) except for pediatric type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes among children was only higher in neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents (P < 0.001). Our findings identify geographic disparities in diabetes prevalence that may require special attention to address the specific needs of adults and children living in these areas. Our results suggest that the food environment may be associated with higher type 1 diabetes prevalence. However, our analysis did not find a robust association with the food environment and pediatric type 2 diabetes, which was predominantly focused in African American neighborhoods.

Large-Scale Implementation of Structured Reporting of Adnexal Masses on Ultrasound The aim of this article is to describe the development and implementation of structured reporting of adnexal mass findings on pelvic ultrasound in a large integrated health care delivery system. A structured reporting system that includes standardized terminology for describing adnexal masses on ultrasound was developed by a multidisciplinary team of radiologists, gynecologists, and gynecologic oncologists on the basis of literature review and internal data. The system uses a reporting template that requires radiologists to assign abnormal adnexal masses to one of five possible categories on the basis of standardized criteria: category 0, 1, 2, or 3 for masses <10 cm, to reflect increasing concern for malignancy, and category X for masses >10 cm. Unique predefined hashtags were linked to each category to enable electronic data extraction, and a hard stop feature was installed that prevents reports from being finalized without a category designation. In 2014, after a 3-month pilot study, large-scale implementation was supported by an educational campaign consisting of web-based conferences, e-mail announcements, and local presentations. Clinical management recommendations on the basis of category and other clinical factors were provided in a separate practice resource for clinicians. Analysis of adherence revealed that 93% of the approximately 12,000 reports describing abnormal adnexal masses in 2016 included category designations. Feedback from referring providers via an anonymous survey indicated high levels of satisfaction with reports. Multidisciplinary collaboration and leveraging of technology enabled large-scale implementation of structured reporting with high levels of adherence among radiologists and improved satisfaction among referring 2018-03-20. Mortality Measures to Profile Hospital Performance for Patients With Septic Shock Sepsis care is becoming a more common target for hospital performance measurement, but few studies have evaluated the acceptability of sepsis or septic shock mortality as a potential performance measure. In the absence of a gold standard to identify septic shock in claims data, we assessed agreement and stability of hospital mortality performance under different case definitions. Retrospective cohort study. U.S. acute care hospitals. Hospitalized with septic shock at admission, identified by either implicit diagnosis criteria (charges for antibiotics, cultures, and vasopressors) or by explicit International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, codes. None. We used hierarchical logistic regression models to determine hospital risk-standardized mortality rates and hospital performance outliers. We assessed agreement in hospital mortality rankings when septic shock cases were identified by either explicit International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, codes or implicit diagnosis criteria. Kappa statistics and intraclass correlation coefficients were used to assess agreement in hospital risk-standardized mortality and hospital outlier status, respectively. Fifty-six thousand six-hundred seventy-three patients in 308 hospitals fulfilled at least one case definition for septic shock, whereas 19,136 (33.8%) met both the explicit International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, and implicit septic shock definition. Hospitals varied widely in risk-standardized septic shock mortality (interquartile range of implicit diagnosis mortality: 25.4-33.5%; International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, diagnosis: 30.2-38.0%). The median absolute difference in hospital ranking between septic shock cohorts defined by International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, versus implicit criteria was 37 places (interquartile range, 16-70), with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.72, p value of less than 0.001; agreement between case definitions for identification of outlier hospitals was moderate (kappa, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.30-0.58]). Risk-standardized septic shock mortality rates varied considerably between hospitals, suggesting that septic shock is an important performance target. However, efforts to profile hospital performance were sensitive to septic shock case definitions, suggesting that septic shock mortality is not currently ready for widespread use as a hospital quality measure.

Depression is a robust risk factor for dementia but it is unknown if this holds true for individuals with T1D, who recently started living to an age conferring dementia risk. We examined if depression is a dementia risk factor among elderly individuals with T1D. 3,742 individuals with T1D age 50 were followed for dementia from 1/1/96-9/30/2015. Depression, dementia, and comorbidities were abstracted from electronic medical records. Cox proportional hazard models estimated the association between depression and dementia adjusting for demographics, glycosylated hemoglobin, severe dysglycemic epidsodes, stroke, heart disease, nephropathy, and end stage renal disease. The cumulative incidence of dementia by depression was estimated conditional on survival dementia-free to age 55. Five percent (N = 182) were diagnosed with dementia and 20% had baseline depression. Depression was associated with a 72% increase in dementia (fully adjusted HR = 1.72; 95% CI:1.12-2.65). The 25-year cumulative incidence of dementia was more than double for those with versus without depression (27% vs. 12%). For people with T1D, depression significantly increases dementia risk. Given the pervasiveness of depression in T1D, this has major implications for successful aging in this population recently living to old Ment Health. 2018 Apr 10:1-7. Healthcare Utilization and Infection in the Week Prior to Sepsis Hospitalization To quantify healthcare utilization in the week preceding sepsis hospitalization to identify potential opportunities to improve the recognition and treatment of sepsis prior to admission. Retrospective study. Two large integrated healthcare delivery systems in the United States. Hospitalized sepsis patients. None. We quantified clinician-based encounters in each of the 7 days preceding sepsis admission, as well as on the day of admission, and categorized them as: hospitalization, subacute nursing facility, emergency department, urgent care, primary care, and specialty care. We identified the proportion of encounters with diagnoses for acute infection based on 28 single-level Clinical Classification Software categories. We also quantified the use of antibiotics over the same interval and used linear regression to evaluate time trends. We included a total of 14,658 Kaiser Permanente Northern California sepsis hospitalizations and 31,369 Veterans Health Administration sepsis hospitalizations. Over 40% of patients in both cohorts required intensive care. A total of 7,747 Kaiser Permanente Northern California patients (52.9%) and 14,280 Veterans Health Administration patients (45.5%) were seen by a clinician in the week before sepsis. Prior to sepsis, utilization of subacute nursing facilities remained steady, whereas hospital utilization declined. Primary care, specialty care, and emergency department visits increased, particularly at admission day. Among those with a presepsis encounter, 2,648 Kaiser Permanente Northern California patients (34.2%) and 3,858 Veterans Health Administration patients (27.0%) had at least one acute infection diagnosis. An increasing percentage of outpatient encounters also had infectious diagnoses (3.3%/d; 95% CI, 1.5%-5.1%; p < 0.01), particularly in primary and specialty care settings. Prior to sepsis hospitalization, the use of antibiotics also increased steadily (2.1%/d; 95% CI, 1.1%-3.1%; p < 0.01). Over 45% of sepsis patients had clinician-based encounters in the week prior to hospitalization with an increasing frequency of diagnoses for acute infection and antibiotic use in the outpatient setting. These presepsis encounters offer several potential opportunities to improve the recognition, risk stratification, and treatment prior to sepsis hospitalization. Med. 2018 04;46(4):513-516. Accuracy of international classification of diseases, ninth revision, codes for postpartum hemorrhage among women undergoing cesarean delivery Determining the accuracy of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) codes for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is vital for reaching valid conclusions about the epidemiology of PPH. Our primary objectives were to assess the performance characteristics of ICD-9 PPH codes against a reference standard using estimated blood loss (EBL) among a cohort undergoing Cesarean delivery. We analyzed maternal discharge and EBL data from women who underwent Cesarean delivery at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities between 2010 and 2013. We defined PPH as an EBL of at least 1000 mL. In a secondary analysis, ICD-9 performance characteristics were assessed using an EBL of at least 1500 mL to classify severe PPH. We identified 35,614 hospitalizations for Cesarean delivery. Using EBL of at least 1000 mL as the \"gold standard,\" PPH codes had a sensitivity of 27.8%, specificity of 97%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 74.5%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 80.9%. The prevalence of a PPH code (9%) was lower than the prevalence using a blood loss of at least 1000 mL (24%). Using a reference standard of EBL of at least 1500 mL, PPH codes had a sensitivity of 61.7%, specificity of of 34.2%, and NPV of PPH have high specificity, moderately high PPVs and NPVs, and low sensitivity. An EBL of at least 1500 mL as a reference standard has higher sensitivity. Our findings suggest that, for women undergoing Cesarean delivery, quality improvement efforts are needed to enhance PPH ICD-9 coding accuracy in administrative data 2018-01-26. Effect of Out-of-Pocket Cost on Medication Initiation, Adherence, and Persistence among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: The Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) To estimate the effect of out-of-pocket (OOP) cost on nonadherence to classes of cardiometabolic medications among patients with diabetes. Electronic health records from a large, health care delivery system for 223,730 patients with diabetes prescribed 842,899 new cardiometabolic medications during 2006-2012. Observational, new prescription cohort study of the effect of OOP cost on medication initiation and adherence. Adherence and OOP costs were based on pharmacy dispensing records and benefits. Primary nonadherence (never dispensed) increased monotonically with OOP cost after adjusting for demographics, neighborhood socioeconomic status, Medicare, medical financial assistance, OOP maximum, deductibles, mail order pharmacy incentive and use, drug type, generic or brand, day's supply, and comorbidity index; 7 percent were never dispensed the new medication when OOP cost $11, 5 percent with OOP cost of $1-$10, and 3 percent when the medication was free of charge (p < .0001). Higher OOP cost was also strongly associated with inadequate secondary adherence (20 percent of time without adequate medication). There was no clinically significant or consistent relationship between OOP costs and early nonpersistence (dispensed once, never refilled) or later stage nonpersistence (discontinued within 24 months). Cost-sharing may deter clinically vulnerable patients from initiating essential medications, undermining adherence and risk factor control. Authors: Karter 2018 04;53(2):1227-1247. Epub 2017-05-05. Association of Inflammatory Markers with Disease Progression in Patients with Metastatic Melanoma Treated with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors We investigated the effect of inflammatory biomarkers (neutrophil, platelet, and lymphocyte counts) on risk of progression in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1). This retrospective cohort study included 108 patients with malignant melanoma treated with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor from August 2014 through December 2015. The outcome was disease progression noted on imaging or clinical examination. Follow-up began on the date of initiation of anti-PD-1 therapy and ended on the date of progression, disenrollment, death of causes other than malignant melanoma, or the end of the study in February 2017. The median time from initiating therapy with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) to the end of follow-up was 118 days. After adjustment, baseline neutrophil and platelet counts were associated with progression. The hazard ratio (HR) for neutrophil counts 5501/L vs 3900/L was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-4.6, p < 0.05). For platelet counts 304,000 vs 215,000/L, the HR was 2.0 (CI = 1.0-3.9, p < 0.05). For lymphocyte counts 1716/L vs 1120/L, the HR was 0.5 (CI = 0.2-1.0, p = 0.05). For patients with metastatic melanoma treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab, higher neutrophil or platelet counts, or lower lymphocyte counts, are associated with higher risk of progression. For these patients, we recommend more frequent assessment for progression and closer follow-up, especially for patients with substantial comorbidities or poor Authors: Pan to engage with eHealth patient education and self-care resources: a cross-sectional survey This study examined access to digital technologies, skills and experience, and preferences for using web-based and other digital technologies to obtain health information and advice among older adults in a large health plan. A primary aim was to assess the extent to which digital divides by race/ethnicity and age group might affect the ability of a large percentage of seniors, and especially those in vulnerable groups, to engage with online health information and advice modalities (eHIA) and mobile health (mHealth) monitoring tools. A mailed survey was conducted with age-sex stratified random samples of English-speaking non-Hispanic white, African-American/black (black), Hispanic/Latino (Latino), Filipino-American (Filipino), and Chinese-American (Chinese) Kaiser Permanente Northern California members who were aged 65-79 years. Respondent data were weighted to the study population for the cross-sectional analyses. Older seniors and black, Latino, and Filipino seniors have less access to digital tools, less experience performing a variety of online tasks, and are less likely to believe that they would be capable of going online for health information and advice compared to younger and white Non-Hispanic seniors. Consequently, they are also less likely to be interested in using eHIA modalities. The same subgroups of seniors that have previously been shown to have higher prevalence of chronic conditions and greater difficulties with healthcare access are also less likely to adopt use of eHIA and mHealth monitoring technologies. At the patient population level, this digital divide is important to take into account when planning health information and chronic disease management programs. At the individual patient level, to provide good patient-centered care, it is important for providers to assess rather than assume digital access, eHealth skills, and preferences prior to recommending use of web-based resources and mHealth tools. Authors: of cognitive bias modification-memory on depressive symptoms and autobiographical memory bias: two independent studies in high-ruminating and dysphoric samples. Memory bias is a risk factor for depression. In two independent studies, the efficacy of one CBM-Memory session on negative memory bias and depressive symptoms was tested in vulnerable samples. We compared positive to neutral (control) CBM-Memory trainings in highly-ruminating individuals (N = 101) and individuals with elevated depressive symptoms (N = 100). In both studies, participants studied positive, neutral, and negative Swahili words paired with their translations. In five study-test blocks, they were then prompted to retrieve either only the positive or neutral translations. Immediately following the training and one week later, we tested cued recall of all translations and autobiographical memory bias; and also measured mood, depressive symptoms, and rumination. Retrieval practice resulted in training-congruent recall both immediately after and one week after the training. Overall, there was no differential decrease in symptoms or difference in autobiographical memory bias between the training conditions. In the dysphoric but not in the high-ruminating sample, the positive training resulted in positive autobiographical bias only in dysphoric individuals with positive pre-existing bias. We conclude that one session of positive retrieval-based CBM-Memory may not be enough to yield symptom change and affect autobiographical memory bias in Mar 15. Sex, race, and insurance status differences in hospital treatment and outcomes following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. BACKGROUND: Sex, race, and insurance status are associated with treatment and outcomes in several cardiovascular diseases. These disparities, however, have not been well-studied in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the association of patient sex, race, and insurance status with hospital treatments and outcomes following OHCA. METHODS: We studied adult patients in the 2011-2015 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) Patient Discharge Database with a \"present on admission\" diagnosis of cardiac arrest (ICD-9-CM 427.5). Insurance status was classified as private, Medicare, and Medi-Cal/government/self-pay. Our primary outcome was good neurologic recovery at hospital discharge, which was determined by discharge disposition. Secondary outcomes were survival to hospital discharge, treatment at a 24/7 percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) center, \"do not resuscitate\" orders within 24h of admission, and cardiac catheterization during hospitalization. Data were analyzed with hierarchical multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: We studied 38,163 patients in the OSHPD database. Female sex, non-white race, and Medicare insurance status were independently associated with worse neurologic recovery [OR 0.94 (0.89-0.98), 0.93 (0.88-0.98), and (0.84-0.97), and 0.44 (0.40-0.48), respectively]. Female white race, and Medicare insurance were associated with DNR orders within 24h of admission [OR 1.16 (1.10-1.23), 1.14 (1.07-1.21), and 1.25 (1.15-1.36), respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Sex, race, and insurance status were independently associated with post-arrest care interventions, patient outcomes and treatment at a 24/7 PCI center. More studies are needed to fully understand the causes and implications of these disparities. Authors: Casey SD; Mumma BE Thromboprophylaxis for Patients with High-risk Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter Discharged from the Emergency Department Many patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/FL) who are high risk for ischemic stroke are not receiving evidence-based thromboprophylaxis. We examined anticoagulant prescribing within 30 days of receiving dysrhythmia care for non-valvular AF/FL in the emergency department (ED). This prospective study included non-anticoagulated adults at high risk for ischemic stroke (ATRIA score 7) who received emergency AF/FL care and were discharged home from seven community EDs between May 2011 and August 2012. We characterized oral anticoagulant prescribing patterns and identified predictors of receiving anticoagulants within 30 days of the index ED visit. We also describe documented reasons for withholding anticoagulation. Of 312 eligible patients, 128 (41.0%) were prescribed anticoagulation at ED discharge or within 30 days. Independent predictors of anticoagulation included age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.89 per year, (aOR 1.89, 95% CI [1.10-3.23]); and failure of sinus restoration by time of ED discharge (aOR 2.65, 95% CI [1.35-5.21]). Reasons for withholding anticoagulation at ED discharge were documented in 139 of 227 cases (61.2%), the most common of which were deferring the shared decision-making process to the patient's outpatient provider, perceived bleeding risk, patient refusal, and restoration of sinus rhythm. Approximately 40% of non-anticoagulated AF/FL patients at high risk for stroke who presented for emergency dysrhythmia care were prescribed anticoagulation within 30 days. Physicians were less likely to anticoagulate older patients and those with ED sinus restoration. Opportunities exist to improve rates of thromboprophylaxis in this high-risk population.

Exploring young women's decisional needs for contraceptive method choice: A qualitative study Assisting women with choosing contraceptive methods that meet their needs and preferences is essential to providing patient-centered care, but research to inform interventions supporting method choice is lacking. An assessment of patient decisional needs for contraceptive method choice may provide insight into patient-centered ways to support decision making. Using the Ottawa Decision Support Framework as a guide, we conducted a qualitative study with semistructured interviews to identify women's decisional needs for choosing a contraceptive method. The sample consisted of 21 women aged 18-29 from an integrated health care delivery system. We employed thematic analysis to identify common themes in the participants' experience. Overall, participants perceived choosing a contraceptive method to be a somewhat difficult decision and described feeling hesitant and unsure. Lack of knowledge of and familiarity with methods and the unpredictability of side effects contributed to participants' hesitancy. Women considered method choice in the context of their lives and their values for various contraceptive attributes, particularly side effects. Participants identified several sources for contraceptive information. Information from friends and family was highly influential. Participants desired both factual and experiential information. Contraceptive method choice may be difficult for many young women, suggesting a need for decision support. Interventions supporting method choice may be more relevant if they directly address knowledge gaps and uncertainty as well as provide both factual and experiential information on a comprehensive set of contraceptive attributes. Authors: Longitudinal Comorbidity and Acute Physiology Data in Template Matching for Assessing Hospital Quality: An Exploratory Study in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System We sought to build on the template-matching methodology by incorporating longitudinal comorbidities and acute physiology to audit hospital quality. Patients admitted for sepsis and pneumonia, congestive heart failure, hip fracture, and cancer between January 2010 and November 2011 at 18 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals. We generated a representative template of 250 patients in 4 diagnosis groups. We then matched between 1 and 5 patients at each hospital to this template using varying levels of patient information. Data were collected retrospectively from inpatient and outpatient electronic records. Matching on both present-on-admission comorbidity history and physiological data significantly reduced the variation across hospitals in patient severity of illness levels compared with matching on administrative data only. After adjustment for longitudinal comorbidity and acute physiology, hospital rankings on 30-day mortality and estimates of length of stay were statistically different from rankings based on administrative data. Template matching-based approaches to hospital quality assessment can be enhanced using more granular electronic medical record data.

Performance of Coronary Risk Scores Among Patients With Chest Pain in the Emergency Department Both the modified History, Electrocardiogram, Age, Risk factors and Troponin (HEART) score and the Emergency Department Assessment of Chest pain Score (EDACS) can identify patients with possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) at low risk (<1%) for major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The authors sought to assess the comparative accuracy of the EDACS (original and simplified) and modified HEART risk scores when using cardiac troponin I (cTnI) cutoffs below the 99th percentile, and obtain precise MACE risk estimates. The authors conducted a retrospective study of adult emergency department (ED) patients evaluated for possible ACS in an integrated health care system between 2013 and 2015. Negative predictive values for MACE (composite of myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, and all-cause mortality) were determined at 60 days. Reclassification analyses were used to assess the comparative accuracy of risk scores and lower cTnI cutoffs. A total of 118,822 patients with possible ACS were included. The 3 risk scores' accuracies were optimized using the lower limit of cTnI quantitation (<0.02 ng/ml) to define low risk for 60-day MACE, with reclassification yields ranging between 3.4% and 3.9%, while maintaining similar negative predictive values (range 99.49% to 99.55%; p = 0.27). The original EDACS identified the largest proportion of patients as low risk (60.6%; p < 0.0001). Among ED patients with possible ACS, the modified HEART score, original EDACS, and simplified EDACS all predicted a low risk of 60-day MACE with improved accuracy using a cTnI cutoff below the 99th percentile. The original EDACS identified the most low-risk patients, and thus may be the preferred risk DR; Reed ME; Kaiser Permanente CREST Network Investigators J Am Coll Cardiol. 2018 02 13;71(6):606-616. Flexible, Cluster-Based Analysis of the Electronic Medical Record of Sepsis with Composite Mixture Models The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) in healthcare has provided vast new amounts of data for statistical machine learning researchers in their efforts to model and predict patient health status, potentially enabling novel advances in treatment. In the case of sepsis, a debilitating, dysregulated host response to infection, extracting subtle, uncataloged clinical phenotypes from the EMR with statistical machine learning methods has the potential to impact patient diagnosis and treatment early in the course of their hospitalization. However, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to extract these insights from EMR data. First, EMR datasets consist of both static and dynamic observations of discrete and continuous-valued variables, many of which may be missing, precluding the application of standard multivariate analysis techniques. Second, clinical populations observed via EMRs and relevant to the study and management of conditions like sepsis are often heterogeneous; properly accounting for this heterogeneity is critical. Here, we describe an unsupervised, probabilistic framework called a composite mixture model that can simultaneously accommodate the wide variety of observations frequently observed in EMR datasets, characterize heterogeneous clinical populations, and handle missing observations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a large-scale sepsis cohort, developing novel techniques built on our model-based clusters to track patient mortality risk over time and identify physiological trends and distinct subgroups of the dataset associated with elevated risk of mortality during hospitalization.

A systematic review of care management interventions targeting multimorbidity and high care utilization Evidence supporting the effectiveness of care management programs for complex patients has been inconclusive. However, past reviews have not focused on complexity primarily defined by multimorbidity and healthcare utilization. We conducted a systematic review of care management interventions targeting the following three patient groups: adults with two or more chronic medical conditions, adults with at least one chronic medical condition and concurrent depression, and adults identified based solely on high past or predicted healthcare utilization. Eligible studies were identified from PubMed, published between 06/01/2005 and 05/31/2015, and reported findings from a randomized intervention that tested a comprehensive, care management intervention. Identified interventions were grouped based on the three \"complex\" categories of interest (described above). Two investigators extracted data using a structured abstraction form and assessed RCT quality. We screened 989 article titles for eligibility from which 847 were excluded. After reviewing the remaining 142 abstracts, 83 articles were excluded. We reviewed the full-text of 59 full-text articles and identified 15 unique RCTs for the final analysis. Of these 15 studies, two focused on patients with two or more chronic medical conditions, seven on patients with at least one chronic medical condition and depression, and six on patients with high past or predicted healthcare utilization. Measured outcomes included utilization, chronic disease measures, and patient-reported outcomes. The seven studies targeting patients with at least one chronic medical condition and depression demonstrated significant improvement in depression symptoms (ranging from 9.2 to 48.7% improvement). Of the six studies that focused on high utilizers, two showed small reductions in utilization. The quality of the research methodology in most of the studies (12/15) was rated fair or poor. Interventions were more likely to be successful when patients were selected based on having at least one chronic medical condition and concurrent depression, and when patient-reported outcomes were assessed. Future research should focus on the role of mental health in complex care management, finding better methods for identifying patients who would benefit most from care management, and determining which intervention components are needed for which patients. Authors: Baker JM; Grant RW; Gopalan Effectiveness of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Immunoprophylaxis on Bronchiolitis Hospitalizations among High-risk Infants We sought to determine the real-world effectiveness of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunoprophylaxis in a population-based cohort to inform policy. The study population included infants born 1996-2008 and enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. During the RSV season (November-March), RSV immunoprophylaxis administration and the following 30 days were defined as RSV immunoprophylaxis protected period(s), and all other days as unprotected period(s). Bronchiolitis hospitalizations were determined using the International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision codes during RSV season. We used proportional hazard model to estimate bronchiolitis hospitalization risk comparing infants' protected period(s) with unprotected period(s). Infants who ever received RSV immunoprophylaxis had a 32% decreased risk of bronchiolitis hospitalization hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% confidence interval: 0.46, 1.00) when comparing protected periods to unprotected periods. Infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) had a 52% decreased risk in bronchiolitis hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.48, 95% confidence interval: 0.25, 0.94). Under the new 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, 48% of infants eligible based on in-place AAP guidelines at birth would no longer be eligible, but nearly all with CLD remain eligible. RSV immunoprophylaxis is effective in decreasing hospitalization. This association is greatest for infants with CLD, a group still recommended for receipt under the new AAP guidelines.

'The Hand on the Doorknob': Visit Agenda Setting by Complex Patients and Their Primary Care Physicians Choosing which issues to discuss in the limited time available during primary care visits is an important task for complex patients with chronic conditions. We conducted sequential interviews with complex patients (n = 40) and their primary care physicians (n = 17) from 3 different health systems to investigate how patients and physicians prepare for visits, how visit agendas are determined, and how discussion priorities are established during time-limited visits. Visit flow and alignment were enhanced when both patients and physicians were effectively prepared before the visit, when the patient brought up highest-priority items first, the physician and patient worked together at the beginning of the visit to establish the visit agenda, and other team members contributed to agenda setting. A range of factors were identified that undermined the ability of patient and physicians to establish an efficient working agenda: the most prominent were time pressure and short visit lengths, but also included differing visit expectations, patient hesitancy to bring up embarrassing concerns, electronic medical record/documentation requirements, differences balancing current symptoms versus future medical risk, nonactionable items, differing philosophies about medications and lifestyle interventions, and difficulty by patients in prioritizing their top concerns. Primary care patients and their physicians adopt a range of different strategies to address the time constraints during visits. The primary factor that supported well-aligned visits was the ability for patients and physicians to proactively negotiate the visit agenda at the beginning of the visit. Efforts to optimize care within time-constrained systems should focus on helping patients more effectively prepare for visits. Physicians should ask for the patient's agenda early, explain visit parameters, establish a reasonable number of concerns that can be discussed, and collaborate on a plan to deal with concerns that cannot be addressed during the visit.

Using Neighborhood-Level Census Data to Predict Diabetes Progression in Patients with Laboratory-Defined Prediabetes Research on predictors of clinical outcomes usually focuses on the impact of individual patient factors, despite known relationships between neighborhood environment and health. To determine whether US census information on where a patient resides is associated with diabetes development among patients with prediabetes. Retrospective cohort study of all 157,752 patients aged 18 years or older from Kaiser Permanente Northern California with laboratory-defined prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose, 100 mg/dL-125 mg/dL, and/or glycated hemoglobin, 5.7%-6.4%). We assessed whether census data on education, income, and percentage of households receiving benefits through the US Department of Agriculture's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was associated with diabetes development using logistic regression controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, blood glucose levels, and body mass index. Progression to diabetes within 36 months. Patients were more likely to progress to diabetes if they lived in an area where less than 16% of adults had obtained a bachelor's degree or higher (odds ratio [OR] =1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-1.36), where median annual income was below $79,999 (OR = 1.16 95% CI = 1.03-1.31), or where SNAP benefits were received by 10% or more of households (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.1-1.4). Area-level socioeconomic and food assistance data predict the development of diabetes, even after adjusting for traditional individual demographic and clinical factors. Clinical interventions should take these factors into account, and health care systems should consider addressing social needs and community resources as a path to improving health outcomes.

Liver Enzymes in Early to Mid-pregnancy, Insulin Resistance, and Gestational Diabetes Risk: A Longitudinal Analysis Background: Liver enzymes may be implicated in glucose homeostasis; liver enzymes progressively change during pregnancy but longitudinal data during pregnancy in relation to insulin resistance and gestational diabetes (GDM) risk are lacking. We investigated longitudinal associations of -glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) with insulin secretion and resistance markers across early to mid-pregnancy and subsequent GDM risk. Methods: Within the prospective Pregnancy Environment and Lifestyle Study cohort, 117 GDM cases were ascertained and matched to 232 non-GDM controls in a nested case-control study. Fasting blood samples were collected at two clinic visits (CV1, gestational weeks 10-13; CV2, gestational weeks 16-19). Linear mixed model and conditional logistic regression were used, adjusting for major risk factors for GDM. Results: In repeated measure analysis, after adjusting for confounders including body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio, GGT per standard deviation increment was associated with elevated fasting glucose and HOMA-IR (% change = 1.51%, 95% CI 0.56-2.46% and 7.43%, 95% CI CV2, GGT levels comparing the highest versus lowest quartile were associated with 3.01-fold (95% CI 1.32-6.85) and 3.51-fold (95% CI Epub 2018-10-02. An Observational Study of Cardiovascular Risks Associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapies: A Comparison of Two Analytical Approaches Comparative safety studies typically use hierarchical treatment categories that lump monotherapy and combination therapy. The consequence of this approach on study results is not clear. For example, studies of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors usually lump users regardless of whether they are using the drug alone or in combination with other agents. This study explored the importance of lumping vs splitting users of monotherapy and combination therapy. We also explored whether the timing of disenrollment from Health Plan membership was informative as an outcome variable when interpreting unmeasured, time-varying confounding. This observational cohort study included Kaiser Permanente Northern California 2003 to 2013 members with rheumatoid arthritis who started methotrexate. The study end point was a major cardiovascular event. In Cox proportional hazards analysis, we compared treatment classifications using five lumped categories with treatment classification using nine split categories. We also studied disenrollment as an outcome. Among 5885 patients, 238 experienced serious cardiovascular events during an average follow-up of 4.25 years. Analysis of drug treatments using 5 lumped categories was difficult to interpret because treatment effects and drug users were mixed. In contrast, analysis of 9 drug categories that split monotherapies from combination therapy was easier to interpret, although confidence intervals were wider. Analysis of drug treatment in relation to disenrollment provided useful information with which to assess study validity, although the power of the analysis was limited. In comparative safety studies, we recommend greater transparency in classifying treatment and evaluating disenrollment. Authors: Herrinton LJ; Goldfien R Perm J. 2018;22:17-101. Improving the quality of care and patient experience of care during the diagnosis of lupus: a qualitative study of primary care Purpose To better understand diagnostic delay and doctor-patient communication during the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematous in patients without malar rash, we conducted a qualitative study of primary care providers' perceptions. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of eight primary care physicians in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Telephone interviews were recorded, transcribed, reviewed, and coded for domains and themes. Results We identified five domains related to diagnosis: initial assessment and tests, initial diagnosis and empiric treatment, timeliness of diagnosis, communicating with the patient, and opportunities for improvement. In the absence of malar rash, the lupus manifestations are common while the disease is rare. Once the primary care provider believes that the disease may be autoimmune, they work with a rheumatologist, but this could take months. Initially, the physician assesses whether the condition is self-limiting or responds to empiric treatments. Over time, as empiric treatments fail or additional lupus manifestations emerge, the primary care provider makes a referral. Doctor-patient communication is critical to help the physician make sense of the symptoms, maintain trust, and assure the patient that he or she is receiving appropriate care. Patient persistence and communication are critically important. Continuing education was deemed essential by each physician. Conclusion In the absence of malar rash, a lupus diagnosis can be difficult. Enhanced doctor-patient communication, patient persistence, physician access to rheumatology and continuing education of primary care might improve time to diagnosis and the patient's experience with primary care. This knowledge is transferable to other rare, complex diseases. to statin therapy, barriers to adherence, and perceptions of cardiovascular risk Patient reports of their adherence behaviors, concerns about statins, and perceptions of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk could inform approaches for improving adherence to statin therapy. We examined these factors and their associations with adherence. We conducted telephone interviews among a stratified random sample of adults receiving statins within an integrated delivery system (N = 730, 81% response rate) in 2010. We sampled equal numbers of individuals in three clinical risk categories: those with 1) coronary artery disease; 2) diabetes or other ASCVD diagnosis; and 3) no diabetes or ASCVD diagnoses. We assessed 15 potential concerns about and barriers to taking statins, and perceived risk of having a heart attack in the next 10 years (0-10 scale). We calculated the proportion of days covered (PDC) by statins in the last 12 months using dispensing data and used multivariate logistic regression to examine the characteristics associated with non-adherence (PDC<80%). Analyses were weighted for sampling proportions. Sixty-one percent of patients with PDC<50% reported not filling a new prescription, splitting or skipping statins, or stopping refilling statins in the last 12 months vs. 15% of those with PDC80% (p<0.05). The most commonly reported concerns about statins were preferring to lower cholesterol with lifestyle changes (66%), disliking medications in general (59%), and liver or kidney problems (31%); having trouble remembering to take statins (9%) was the most common reason for taking less than prescribed. In multivariate analyses, clinical risk categories were not significantly associated with odds of non-adherence; however, those with higher perceived risk of heart attack were less likely to be non-adherent. Patient-reported medication-taking behaviors were correlated with statin PDC and those with lower perceived cardiovascular risk were less likely to be adherent. These findings highlight the importance of eliciting from and educating patients on their adherence behaviors and ASCVD risks. Authors: Fung V; 2018-02-08. Diabetes Screening among Antipsychotic-Treated Adults with Severe Mental Illness in an Integrated Delivery System: A Retrospective Cohort Study Severe mental illness (SMI) is associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes, partly due to adverse metabolic effects of antipsychotic medications. In public health care settings, annual screening rates are 30%. We measured adherence to national diabetes screening guidelines for patients taking antipsychotic medications. To estimate diabetes screening prevalence among patients with SMI within an integrated health care system, and to assess characteristics associated with lack of screening. Retrospective cohort study. Antipsychotic-treated adults with SMI. We excluded participants with known diabetes. Primary outcome was screening via fasting glucose test or hemoglobin A1c during a 1-year period. In 2014, 16,754 patients with SMI diagnoses were receiving antipsychotics. Seventy-four percent of these patients' providers ordered diabetes screening tests that year, but only 55% (9247/16,754) received screening. When the observation time frame was extended to 2 years, 73% (12,250/16,754) were screened. Adjusting for sex and race/ethnicity, young adults (aged 18-29 years) were less likely to receive screening than older age groups [adjusted RR (aRR) 1.23-1.57, p < 0.0001]. Compared to whites, screening was more common for Asians (aRR 1.141, 95% CI 1.089-1.195, p < 0.0001), less common for blacks (aRR 0.946, 95% CI 0.898-0.997, p < 0.0375), and no different for Hispanics (aRR 1.030, 95% CI 0.988-1.074, p = 0.165). Smokers were less likely to be screened than non-smokers (aRR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97, p < 0.0008). Utilization of either mental health or primary care services increased the likelihood of screening. While almost three-fourths of adults with SMI taking antipsychotic medications received a lab order for diabetes screening, only 55% received screening within a 12-month period. Young adults and smokers were less likely to be screened, despite their disproportionate metabolic risk. Future studies should assess the barriers and facilitators with regard to diabetes screening in this vulnerable population at the patient, provider, and system levels.

Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injury: Risk-Adjusted Comparisons in an Integrated Healthcare Delivery System Although healthcare organizations have decreased hospital-acquired pressure injury (HAPI) rates, HAPIs are not eliminated, driving further examination in both nursing and health services research. The objective was to describe HAPI incidence, risk factors, and risk-adjusted hospital variation within a California integrated healthcare system. Inpatient episodes were included in this retrospective cohort if patients were hospitalized between January 1, 2013, and June 30, 2015. The primary outcome was development of a HAPI over time. Predictors included cited HAPI risk factors in addition to incorporation of a longitudinal comorbidity burden (Comorbidity Point Score, Version 2 [COPS2]), a severity-of-illness score (Laboratory-Based Acute Physiology Score, Version 2 [LAPS2]), and the Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Ulcer Risk. Analyses included HAPI inpatient episodes (n = 1661) and non-HAPI episodes (n = 726,605). HAPI incidence was 0.57 per 1,000 patient days (95% CI [0.019, 3.805]) and 0.2% of episodes. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed significant (p < .001) hazard ratios (HRs) for the change from the 25th to the 75th percentile for age (HR = 1.36, 95% CI [1.25, 1.45]), higher COPS2 scores (HR = 1.10, 95% CI [1.04, 1.16]), and higher LAPS2 scores (HR = 1.38, 95% CI [1.28, 1.50]). Female gender, an emergency room admission for a medical reason, and higher Braden scores showed significant protective HRs (HR < 1.00, p < .001). After risk adjustment, significant variation remained among the 35 hospitals. Results prompt the consideration of age, severity of illness (LAPS2), comorbidity indexes (COPS2), and the Braden score as important predictors for HAPI risk. HAPI rates may be low; however, because of significant individual site variation, HAPIs remain an area to explore through both research and quality improvement Jan/Feb;67(1):16-25. Rectal Cancer Survivors' Participation in Productive Activities Rectal cancer and its treatment impair survivors' productivity. To assess determinants of market and nonmarket employment, job search, volunteering, and homemaking among survivors five years or longer after diagnosis. We mailed questionnaires to 1063 survivors who were members of (Northern California, Northwest) during 2010 and 2011. Productive activities, functional health status, and bowel management at the time of the survey. Response rate was 60.5% (577/953). Higher comorbidity burdens were associated with lower productivity for men and women rectal cancer survivors. Productive survivors were younger and had lower disease stage and age at diagnosis, higher household income and educational attainment, and fewer comorbidity burdens and workplace adjustments than did nonproductive survivors (p < 0.05 each; 2-sided). Productive rectal cancer survivors were evenly split by sex. Staying productive is associated with better mental health for rectal cancer survivors. Rectal cancer survivors with multiple chronic conditions, higher disease stage, lower productive activities, and older age need better access to medical care and closer monitoring of the quality of their care, including self-care. To capture the full extent of the involvement of survivors in all types of productive activities, research should routinely include measures of employment, searching for employment, homemaking, and volunteering. Counting market and nonmarket productive activities is innovative and recognizes the continuum of contributions survivors make to families and society. Health care systems should routinely monitor rectal cancer survivors' medical care access, comorbidities, health-related quality of life, Wellness: A multi-component behavioral intervention for patients not responding to traditional Cardiovascular disease management Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US. Many patients do not benefit from traditional disease management approaches to CVD risk reduction. Here we describe the rationale, development, and implementation of a multi-component behavioral intervention targeting patients who have persistently not met goals of CVD risk factor control. Informed by published evidence, relevant theoretical frameworks, stakeholder advice, and patient input, we developed a group-based intervention (Changing Results: Engage and Activate to Enhance Wellness; \"CREATE Wellness\") to address the complex needs of patients with elevated or unmeasured CVD-related risk factors. We are testing this intervention in a randomized trial among patients with persistent (i.e > 2 years) sub-optimal risk factor control despite being enrolled in an advanced and highly successful CVD disease management program. The CREATE Wellness intervention is designed as a 3 session, group-based intervention combining proven elements of patient activation, health system engagement skills training, shared decision making, care planning, and identification of lifestyle change barriers. Our key learnings in designing the intervention included the value of multi-level stakeholder input and the importance of pragmatic skills training to address barriers to care. The CREATE Wellness intervention represents an evidence-based, patient-centered approach for patients not responding to traditional disease management. The trial is currently underway at three medical facilities within Kaiser Permanente Northern California and next steps include an evaluation of efficacy, adaptation for non-English speaking patient populations, and modification of the curriculum for web- or phone-based versions.

Effects of Transitioning to Medicare Part D on Access to Drugs for Medical Conditions among Dual Enrollees with Cancer To evaluate the impact of transitioning from Medicaid to Medicare Part D drug coverage on the use of noncancer treatments among dual enrollees with cancer. We leveraged a representative 5% national sample of all fee-for-service dual enrollees in the United States (2004-2007) to evaluate the impact of the removal of caps on the number of reimbursable prescriptions per month (drug caps) under Part D on 1) prevalence and 2) average days' supply dispensed for antidepressants, antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering agents overall and by race (white and black). The removal of drug caps was associated with increased use of lipid-lowering medications (days' supply 3.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57-5.70). Among blacks in capped states, we observed increased use of lipid-lowering therapy (any use 0.08 percentage points; 0.61-3.78) and increasing trends in antihypertensive use (any use 0.01 percentage points; 95% CI days' supply 1.83; 95% The white-black gap in the use of lipid-lowering medications was immediately reduced (-0.09 percentage points; 95% CI -0.15 to -0.04). We also observed a reversal in trends toward widening white-black differences in antihypertensive use (level -0.08 percentage points; points; 95% CI -0.01 to -0.0004). Our findings suggest that the removal of drug caps under Part D had a modest impact on the treatment of hypercholesterolemia overall and may have reduced white-black gaps in the use of lipid-lowering and antidepressant therapies.

Overcoming barriers to diabetic polyneuropathy management in primary care Diabetic polyneuropathy is a highly prevalent and costly complication of diabetes that is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated in primary care settings. In this article, we discuss challenges in the management of diabetic polyneuropathy symptoms, including diagnostic complexity, the limited efficacy and high side effect rates associated with available treatments and the time constrained primary care visit. We call for the development of novel patient-centric, system-level strategies that engage patients between physician visits in order to facilitate timely communication of symptoms and treatment response and to promote patient-centered care. a Portal to Engage Family Care Partners Authors: Reed ME; Huang J; Brand Grant R JAMA Intern Med. 2017 Nov 20. Physical activity, bowel function, and quality of life among rectal cancer survivors Physical activity (PA) is positively associated with numerous health benefits among cancer survivors. This study examined insufficiently investigated relationships among PA, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and bowel function (BF) in rectal cancer survivors. RC survivors (n = 1063) 5 years from diagnosis in two Kaiser permanente regions were mailed a multidimensional survey to assess HRQOL and BF. PA was assessed by a modified Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. PA minutes were categorized into weighted categories based on guidelines: (1) not active (zero PA minutes); (2) insufficiently active (1-149 PA minutes); (3) meeting guidelines (150-299 PA minutes); and (4) above guidelines (300 PA minutes). Relationships of PA with HRQOL and BF were evaluated using multiple linear regression, stratified by sex and ostomy status for BF. Types of PA identified as helpful for BF and symptoms addressed were summarized. Response rate was 60.5%. Of 557 participants, 40% met or exceeded PA guidelines, 34% were not active, and 26% were insufficiently active. Aerobic activities, specifically walking and cycling, were most commonly reported to help BF. Higher PA was associated with better psychological wellbeing and multiple SF12 scales, worse BF scores in men with ostomies, and better BF scores in women. Meeting or exceeding PA guidelines was associated with higher HRQOL. Although the BF findings are exploratory, they suggest women may benefit from increased PA, whereas men with ostomies may face challenges that require more study. Identifying PA strategies that will lead to improved patient compliance and benefit are needed.

Predictors of Bowel Function in Long-term Rectal Cancer Survivors with Anastomosis Bowel function in long-term rectal cancer survivors with anastomosis has not been characterized adequately. We hypothesized that bowel function is associated with patient, disease, and treatment characteristics. The cohort study included Kaiser Permanente members who were long-term (5 years) rectal cancer survivors with anastomosis. Bowel function was scored using the self-administered, 14-item Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Bowel Function Index. Patient, cancer, and treatment variables were collected from the electronic medical chart. We used multiple regression to assess the relationship of patient- and treatment-related variables with the bowel function score. The study included 381 anastomosis patients surveyed an average 12 years after their rectal cancer surgeries. The total bowel function score averaged 53 (standard deviation, 9; range, 31-70, higher scores represent better function). Independent factors associated with worse total bowel function score included receipt of radiation therapy (yes vs. no: 5.3-unit decrement, p < 0.0001), tumor distance from verge (6 cm vs. >6 cm: 3.2-unit decrement, p < 0.01), and history of a temporary ostomy (yes vs. no: 4.0-unit decrement, p < 0.01). One factor measured at time of survey was also associated with worse total bowel function score: ever smoking (2.3-unit decrement, p < 0.05). The regression model explained 20% of the variation in the total bowel function score. Low tumor location, radiation therapy, temporary ostomy during initial treatment, and history of smoking were linked with decreased long-term bowel function following an anastomosis. These results should improve decision-making Reduce Diabetes Risk in Women of Reproductive Age: Assessment and Treatment of Prediabetes within a Large Integrated Delivery System Preventing diabetes before pregnancy may be important to improve maternal and infant outcomes. Although the preconception period is a crucial time to focus on chronic disease prevention, little is known about preventive services for reproductive-aged women at risk of developing diabetes. Using electronic health record data from patients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, we identified 21,965 nonpregnant women aged 18 to 44 with incident prediabetes (PDM; fasting plasma glucose [FPG] = 100-125 or glycated hemoglobin A1c = 5.7%-6.4%) between 2007 and 2010. We looked for evidence of a \"clinical response\" to PDM in the 6 months after laboratory testing, defined as retesting of blood glucose levels, referral or attendance to health education, diagnosis of PDM, metformin initiation, or a clinical note of discussion of PDM. Multilevel models were used to examine the relationship between patient characteristics and clinical response, and to assess provider-level variation. Fewer than one-half of women had a documented clinical response to the PDM-range laboratory result. Women with higher FPG values and body mass indexes were more likely to have a PDM diagnosis (FPG 120-125 vs. 100-119: 95% 120-125 for metformin initiation (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.8; p < .01). Low clinical response to PDM among women of reproductive age suggests there are missed opportunities for diabetes prevention among this vulnerable population.

Emotion dysregulation moderates the effect of cognitive behavior therapy with prolonged exposure for co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders. A goal of clinical trials is to identify unique baseline characteristics that can inform treatment planning. One such target is emotion dysregulation (ED), which contributes to the maintenance of co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD) and may be a potential moderator of treatment response. We examined the moderating impact of ED severity on treatment outcomes in an urban, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and racially/ethnically diverse sample with complex trauma and severe SUDs. Participants with co-occurring PTSD and SUD (PTSD+SUD) were randomized to Concurrent Treatment with Prolonged Exposure (COPE, n=39), Relapse Prevention Therapy (RPT, n=43), or an active monitoring control group (AMCG, n=28). Baseline ED severity moderated treatment outcomes such that high ED was associated with greater reduction in PTSD severity among those who received COPE relative to RPT and AMCG. In contrast, low ED was associated with greater reduction in substance use among those in RPT relative to COPE and AMCG. Implications for individualizing and optimizing treatment selection Oct 16. Comparing Hospital Processes and Outcomes in California Medicare Beneficiaries: Simulation Prompts Reconsideration This article is not a traditional research report. It describes how conducting a specific set of benchmarking analyses led us to broader reflections on hospital benchmarking. We reexamined an issue that has received far less attention from researchers than in the past: How variations in the hospital admission threshold might affect hospital rankings. Considering this threshold made us reconsider what benchmarking is and what future benchmarking studies might be like. Although we recognize that some of our assertions are speculative, they are based on our reading of the literature and previous and ongoing data analyses being conducted in our research unit. We describe the benchmarking analyses that led to these reflections. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Hospital Compare Web site includes data on fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries but does not control for severity of illness, which requires physiologic data now available in most electronic medical records.To address this limitation, we compared hospital processes and outcomes among Kaiser Permanente Northern California's (KPNC) Medicare Advantage beneficiaries and non-KPNC California Medicare beneficiaries between 2009 and 2010. We assigned a simulated severity of illness measure to each record and explored the effect of having the additional information on outcomes. We found that if the admission severity of illness in non-KPNC hospitals increased, KPNC hospitals' mortality performance would appear worse; conversely, if admission severity at non-KPNC hospitals' decreased, KPNC hospitals' performance would appear better. Future hospital benchmarking should consider the impact of variation in admission thresholds. Authors: Escobar GJ; Baker Kipnis Perm J. 2017;21. The Delivery Science Rapid Analysis Program: A Research and Operational Partnership at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health care researchers and delivery system leaders share a common mission to improve health care quality and outcomes. However, differing timelines, incentives, and priorities are often a barrier to research and operational partnerships. In addition, few funding mechanisms exist to generate and solicit analytic questions that are of interest to both research and to operations within health care settings, and provide rapid results that can be used to improve practice and outcomes. The Delivery Science Rapid Analysis Program (RAP) was formed in 2013 within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, sponsored by The Permanente Medical Group. A Steering Committee consisting of both researchers and clinical leaders solicits and reviews proposals for rapid analytic projects that will use existing data and are feasible within 6 months and with up to $30,000 (approximately 25-50% full-time equivalent) of programmer/analyst effort. Review criteria include the importance of the analytic question for both research and operations, and the potential for the project to have a significant impact on care delivery within 12 months of completion. The RAP funded 5 research and operational analytic projects between 2013 and 2017. These projects spanned a wide range of clinical areas, including lupus, pediatric obesity, diabetes, e-cigarette use, and hypertension. The hypertension RAP project, which focused on optimizing thiazide prescribing in Black/African-American patients with hypertension, led to new insights that inform an equitable care quality metric designed to reduce blood pressure control disparities throughout the KPNC region. Programs that actively encourage research and operational analytic partnerships have significant potential to improve care, enhance research collaborations, and contribute to the building and sustaining of learning health care systems.

The Incidence and Prevalence of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in San Francisco County, California: The California Lupus Surveillance Project Estimates of the incidence and prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the US have varied widely. The purpose of this study was to conduct the California Lupus Surveillance Project (CLSP) to determine credible estimates of SLE incidence and prevalence, with a special focus on Hispanics and Asians. The CLSP, which is funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a population-based registry of individuals with SLE residing in San Francisco County, CA, from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2009. Data sources included hospitals, rheumatologists, nephrologists, commercial laboratories, and a state hospital discharge database. We abstracted medical records to ascertain SLE cases, which we defined as patients who met 4 of the 11 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE. We estimated crude and age-standardized incidence and prevalence, which were stratified by sex and race/ethnicity. The overall age-standardized annual incidence rate was 4.6 per 100,000 person-years. The average annual period prevalence was 84.8 per 100,000 persons. The age-standardized incidence rate in women and men was 8.6 and 0.7 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. This rate was highest among black women (30.5), followed by Hispanic women (8.9), Asian women (7.2), and white women (5.3). The age-standardized prevalence in women per 100,000 persons was 458.1 in blacks, 177.9 in Hispanics, 149.7 in Asians, and 109.8 in whites. Capture-recapture modeling estimated 33 additional incident cases and 147 additional prevalent cases. Comprehensive methods that include intensive case-finding provide more credible estimates of SLE in Hispanics and Asians, and confirm racial and ethnic disparities in SLE. The disease burden of SLE is highest in black women, followed by Hispanic women, Asian women, and white Validation of a Tool to Identify Patients With Type 2 Diabetes at High Risk of Hypoglycemia-Related Emergency Department or Hospital Use Hypoglycemia-related emergency department (ED) or hospital use among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is clinically significant and possibly preventable. To develop and validate a tool to categorize risk of hypoglycemic-related utilization in patients with T2D. Using recursive partitioning with a split-sample design, we created a classification tree based on potential predictors of hypoglycemia-related ED or hospital use. The resulting model was transcribed into a tool for practical application and tested in 1 internal and 2 fully independent, external samples. Development and internal testing was conducted in a split sample of 206 435 patients with T2D from Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated health care system. The tool was externally tested in 1 335 966 Veterans Health Administration and 14 972 Group Health Cooperative patients with T2D. Based on a literature review, we identified 156 candidate predictor variables (prebaseline exposures) using data collected from electronic medical records. Hypoglycemia-related ED or hospital use during 12 months of follow-up. The derivation sample (n = 165 148) had a mean (SD) age of 63.9 (13.0) years and included 78 576 (47.6%) women. The crude annual rate of at least 1 hypoglycemia-related ED or hospital encounter in the KPNC derivation sample was 0.49%. The resulting hypoglycemia risk stratification tool required 6 patient-specific inputs: number of prior episodes of hypoglycemia-related utilization, insulin use, sulfonylurea use, prior year ED use, chronic kidney disease stage, and age. We categorized the predicted 12-month risk of any hypoglycemia-related utilization as high (>5%), intermediate (1%-5%), or low (<1%). In the internal validation sample, 2.0%, 10.7%, and 87.3% were categorized as high, intermediate, and low risk, respectively, with observed 12-month hypoglycemia-related utilization rates of 6.7%, 1.4%, and 0.2%, respectively. There was good discrimination in the internal validation KPNC sample (C statistic = 0.83) and both external validation samples (Veterans Health Administration: C statistic = 0.81; Group Health Cooperative: C statistic = 0.79). This hypoglycemia risk stratification tool categorizes the 12-month risk of hypoglycemia-related utilization in patients with T2D using only 6 inputs. This tool could facilitate targeted population management interventions, potentially reducing hypoglycemia risk and improving patient safety and quality of life.

Identifying Distinct Subgroups of ICU Patients: A Machine Learning Approach Identifying subgroups of ICU patients with similar clinical needs and trajectories may provide a framework for more efficient ICU care through the design of care platforms tailored around patients' shared needs. However, objective methods for identifying these ICU patient subgroups are lacking. We used a machine learning approach to empirically identify ICU patient subgroups through clustering analysis and evaluate whether these groups might represent appropriate targets for care redesign efforts. We performed clustering analysis using data from patients' hospital stays to retrospectively identify patient subgroups from a large, heterogeneous ICU population. Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a healthcare delivery system serving 3.9 million members. ICU patients 18 years old or older with an ICU admission between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2012, at one of 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals. None. We used clustering analysis to identify putative clusters among 5,000 patients randomly selected from 24,884 ICU patients. To assess cluster validity, we evaluated the distribution and frequency of patient characteristics and the need for invasive therapies. We then applied a classifier built from the sample cohort to the remaining 19,884 patients to compare the derivation and validation clusters. Clustering analysis successfully identified six clinically recognizable subgroups that differed significantly in all baseline characteristics and clinical trajectories, despite sharing common diagnoses. In the validation cohort, the proportion of patients assigned to each cluster was similar and demonstrated significant differences across clusters for all variables. A machine learning approach revealed important differences between empirically derived subgroups of ICU patients that are not typically revealed by admitting diagnosis or severity of illness alone. Similar data-driven approaches may provide a framework for future organizational innovations in ICU care tailored around patients' shared needs. 2017 Oct;45(10):1607-1615. Reply to the Timing of Early Antibiotics and Hospital Mortality in Sepsis - Playing Devil's Advocate Med. 2017 10 01;196(7):935-936. The Timing of Early Antibiotics and Hospital Mortality in Sepsis Prior sepsis studies evaluating antibiotic timing have shown mixed results. To evaluate the association between antibiotic timing and mortality among patients with sepsis receiving antibiotics within 6 hours of emergency department registration. Retrospective study of 35,000 randomly selected inpatients with sepsis treated at 21 emergency departments between 2010 and 2013 in Northern California. The primary exposure was antibiotics given within 6 hours of emergency department registration. The primary outcome was adjusted in-hospital mortality. We used detailed physiologic data to quantify severity of illness within 1 hour of registration and logistic regression to estimate the odds of hospital mortality based on antibiotic timing and patient factors. The median time to antibiotic administration was 2.1 hours (interquartile range, 1.4-3.1 h). The adjusted odds ratio for hospital mortality based on each hour of delay in antibiotics after registration was 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.13) for each elapsed hour between registration and antibiotic administration. The increase in absolute mortality associated with an hour's delay in antibiotic administration was 0.3% (95% CI, 0.01-0.6%; P = 0.04) for sepsis, 0.4% (95% CI, 0.1-0.8%; P = 0.02) for severe sepsis, and 1.8% (95% CI, 0.8-3.0%; P = 0.001) for shock. In a large, contemporary, and multicenter sample of patients with sepsis in the emergency department, hourly delays in antibiotic administration were associated with increased odds of hospital mortality even among patients who received antibiotics within 6 hours. The odds increased within each sepsis severity strata, and the increased odds of mortality were greatest in septic shock. Authors: Liu Oct 01;196(7):856-863. Ibutilide Effectiveness and Safety in the Cardioversion of Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter in the Community Emergency Department Little is known about the use of ibutilide for cardioversion in atrial fibrillation and flutter outside of clinical trials. We seek to describe patient characteristics, ibutilide administration patterns, cardioversion rates, and adverse outcomes in the community emergency department (ED) setting. We also evaluate potential predictors of cardioversion success. Using a retrospective cohort of adults who received ibutilide in 21 community EDs between January 2009 and June 2015, we gathered demographic and clinical variables from electronic health records and structured manual chart review. We calculated rates of cardioversion and frequency of ventricular tachycardia within 4 hours and estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) in a multivariate regression model for potential predictors of cardioversion. Among 361 patients, the median age was 61 years (interquartile range 53 to 71 years) and most had recent-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter (98.1%). Five percent of the cohort had a history of heart failure. The initial QTc interval was prolonged (>480 ms) in 29.4% of patients, and 3.1% were hypokalemic (<3.5 mEq/L). The mean ibutilide dose was 1.5 mg (SD 0.5 mg) and the rate of ibutilide-related cardioversion within 4 hours was 54.8% flutter. Two patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (0.6%), both during their second ibutilide infusion. Age (in decades) (aOR 1.3; 95% CI fibrillation) (aOR 2.7; 95% CI 1.4 to 5.1), and history of atrial fibrillation and flutter (aOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.1) were associated with cardioversion. The effectiveness and safety of ibutilide in this community ED setting were consistent with clinical trial results despite less stringent patient selection criteria.

A randomized controlled study of power posing before public speaking exposure for social anxiety disorder: No evidence for augmentative effects. This manuscript details a randomized controlled study designed to test the efficacy of power posing (i.e., briefly holding postures associated with dominance and power) as an augmentative strategy for exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Seventy-three individuals diagnosed with SAD were assigned to one of three conditions: power posing, submissive posing, or rest (no posing) prior to participating in an exposure therapy session. Participants were assessed for between-group differences in pre- and post-manipulation salivary hormone levels, within-session subjective experiences of fear, and pre- and 1-week post-treatment SAD severity outcome measures. Though the intervention resulted in decreased SAD symptom severity one week later, analyses revealed no significant between-group differences on any tested variables. Accordingly, this study provides no evidence to suggest that power posing impacts hormone levels or exposure therapy outcomes. medicine: analysis from the CSER Consortium PurposeThe Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research (CSER) Consortium encompasses nine National Institutes of Health-funded U-award projects investigating translation of genomic sequencing into clinical care. Previous literature has distinguished norms and rules governing research versus clinical care. This is the first study to explore how genomics investigators describe and navigate the research-clinical interface.MethodsA CSER working group developed a 22-item survey. All nine U-award projects participated. Descriptive data were tabulated and qualitative analysis of text responses identified themes and characterizations of the research-clinical interface.ResultsSurvey responses described how studies approached the research-clinical interface, including in consent practices, recording results, and using a research versus clinical laboratory. Responses revealed four characterizations of the interface: clear separation between research and clinical care, interdigitation of the two with steps to maintain separation, a dynamic interface, and merging of the two. All survey respondents utilized at least two different characterizations. Although research has traditionally been differentiated from clinical care, respondents pointed to factors blurring the distinction and strategies to differentiate the domains.ConclusionThese results illustrate the difficulty in applying the traditional bifurcation of research versus clinical care to translational models of clinical research, including in genomics. Our results suggest new directions for ethics and oversight.Genetics in Medicine advance online publication, 31 August 2017; 31. Prediction of Recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection Using Comprehensive Electronic Medical Records in an Integrated Healthcare Delivery System BACKGROUND Predicting recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) remains difficult. We employed a retrospective cohort design. Granular electronic medical record (EMR) data had been collected from patients hospitalized at 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals. The derivation dataset (2007-2013) included data from 9,386 patients who experienced incident CDI (iCDI) and 1,311 who experienced their first CDI recurrences (rCDI). The validation dataset (2014) included data from 1,865 patients who experienced incident CDI and 144 who experienced rCDI. Using multiple techniques, including machine learning, we evaluated more than 150 potential predictors. Our final analyses evaluated 3 models with varying degrees of complexity and 1 previously published model. RESULTS Despite having a large multicenter cohort and access to granular EMR data (eg, vital signs, and laboratory test results), none of the models discriminated well (c statistics, 0.591-0.605), had good calibration, or had good explanatory power. CONCLUSIONS Our ability to predict rCDI remains limited. Given currently available EMR technology, improvements in prediction will require incorporating new variables because currently available data elements lack adequate explanatory power.

Incidence of diabetes after a partner's diagnosis People socially connected with each other often share health risks, possibly due to shared environments and behaviors. In a cohort study, we examined whether incidence of diabetes was different for individuals with recently diagnosed partners compared to individuals similar on other characteristics but whose partners were never diagnosed with diabetes. We analyzed 2007-11 data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated health system with >3.5 million members. We estimated annual diabetes incidence controlling for demographic, socio-economic, behavioral, and health characteristics. Using propensity score matching and multivariate logistic regression, we compared odds of incident diabetes among co-residing partners ages 18-89years of people who had been diagnosed with diabetes during the previous year (in robustness checks up to the previous three years) and people who had never been diagnosed but were similar on observed characteristics. Partners of newly-diagnosed people had annual diabetes incidence of 16.4/1000, equivalent to10.8 times higher (95%CI: 9.2-12.6) than people whose spouses had never been diagnosed (1.5/1000). Odds remained higher three years after a spouses' diagnosis (45.4 vs. 11.7/1000). Adjusting for other characteristics, odds of diabetes for those with a partner diagnosed in the previous year were 8.7 times higher (CI: 7.4-10.2) than among those whose partner had never been diagnosed. Also, partners of persons with recently-diagnosed diabetes developed diabetes at much higher rates than the general KPNC and U.S. Individuals with a recently diagnosed partner could be considered a high-risk population for screening and prevention.

Health and economic benefits of reducing sugar intake in the USA, including effects via non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a microsimulation model. OBJECTIVES: Excessive consumption of added sugars in the human diet has been associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary heart disease (CHD) and other elements of the metabolic syndrome. Recent studies have shown that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a critical pathway to metabolic syndrome. This model assesses the health and economic benefits of interventions aimed at reducing intake of added sugars. METHODS: Using data from US National Health Surveys and current literature, we simulated an open cohort, for the period 2015-2035. We constructed a microsimulation model with Markov chains for NAFLD (including steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)), body mass index, T2D and CHD. We assessed reductions in population disease prevalence, disease-attributable disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and costs, with interventions that reduce added sugars consumption by either 20% or 50%. FINDINGS: The model estimated that a 20% reduction in added sugars intake will reduce prevalence of hepatic steatosis, NASH, cirrhosis, HCC, obesity, T2D and CHD. Incidence of T2D and CHD would be expected to decrease by 19.9 (95% CI 12.8 to 27.0) and 9.4 (95% CI 3.1 to 15.8) cases per 100 000 people after 20 years, respectively. A 20% reduction in consumption is also projected to annually avert 0.767 million (M) DALYs (95% CI 0.757M to 0.777M) and a total of US$10.3 billion (B) (95% CI 10.2B to 10.4B) in discounted direct medical costs by 2035. These effects increased proportionally when added sugars intake were reduced by 50%. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in incidence and prevalence of disease is similar to results in other models, but averted costs and DALYs were higher, mainly due to inclusion of NAFLD and CHD. The model suggests that efforts to reduce consumption of added sugars may result in significant public health and economic benefits. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013543. Adaptation of the Acute Organ Failure Score for Use in a Medicare Population Without widely available physiologic data, a need exists for ICU risk adjustment methods that can be applied to administrative data. We sought to expand the generalizability of the Acute Organ Failure Score by adapting it to a commonly used administrative database. Retrospective cohort study. One hundred fifty-one hospitals in Pennsylvania. A total of 90,733 ICU admissions among 77,040 unique patients between January 1, 2009, and December 1, 2009, in the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review database. We used multivariable logistic regression on a random split cohort to predict 30-day mortality, and to examine the impact of using different comorbidity measures in the model and adding historical claims data. Overall 30-day mortality was 17.6%. In the validation cohort, using the original Acute Organ Failure Score model's coefficients resulted in poor discrimination (C-statistic, (95% CI, 0.711-0.730) when the Medicare cohort was used to recalibrate the coefficients. Model discrimination improved further when comorbidity was expressed as the COmorbidity Point Score 2 (C-statistic, 0.737; 95% CI, 0.748; 95% CI, 0.739-0.757) instead of the Charlson index. Adding historical claims data increased the number of comorbidities identified, but did not enhance model performance. Modification of the Acute Organ Failure Score resulted in good model discrimination among a diverse population regardless of comorbidity measure used. This study expands the use of the Acute Organ Failure Score for risk adjustment in ICU research and outcomes reporting using standard administrative data. Med. 2017 Aug 02. Individual and health system variation in rehospitalizations the year after pneumonia Little is known about variation in patterns of recovery among patients discharged alive from hospitalizations for pneumonia.The aim of the is observational cohort study was to characterize the variation in patterns of hospital readmission and survival in the year after discharge for pneumonia in 3 different health systems.The 3 cohorts consisted of (1) the Health and Retirement Study participants enrolled in Fee-for-service Medicare (FFS), (2) Veterans Administration (VA) Healthcare system, and (3) Kaiser Permanente of Northern California (KPNC). The 365-day survival and re-hospitalizations were determined for each cohort. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify potential contributors to the different patterns.We identified 2731, 23,536, and 39,147 hospitalizations for pneumonia in FFS Medicare, VA, and KPNC, respectively, of whom 88.1%, 92.8%, and 89.7% survived to hospital discharge. The median patient survived to 1 year and was rehospitalized twice in FFS (9.0%), once in VA (14.1%) and KPNC (9.1%). Of the patients who survived the hospitalization, 33.3% (FFS), 30.2% (VA), and 26.8% (KPNC) died during the subsequent year. Of those who survived, 29.8% (FFS), 35.9% (VA), and 46.1% (KPNC) (FFS), 11.9% (VA), and 11.7% (KPNC) had greater than 3 hospitalizations. Age, race, gender, comorbidity, ICU use, and hospital length stay collectively explained little (5-7%) of the variation in the recovery pattern.There is significant variation in the year after the hospitalization for pneumonia across individuals, but less so across health systems. There may be important opportunities to better classify these heterogeneous individual-level Immediate Sequential vs. Delayed Sequential Bilateral Cataract Surgery: Retrospective Comparison of Postoperative Visual Outcomes We conducted a retrospective comparative-effectiveness study of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and refractive after immediate sequential (ISBCS) and delayed sequential (DSBCS) bilateral cataract surgery. We tested 2 hypotheses: (1) among DSBCS patients, second-eye outcomes were no different than first-eye outcomes; (2) averaged between each patient's 2 eyes, outcomes did not differ between ISBCS and DSBCS patients. Retrospective comparative-effectiveness study. Kaiser Permanente Northern California members who underwent noncomplex bilateral cataract surgery from January 1, 2013, through June 30, 2015. We performed an intention-to-treat analysis comparing ISBCS to DSBCS using conditional logistic regression analysis, accounting for surgeon and patient-level factors. BCVA, RE. The analysis of visual outcomes included both eyes of 13 711 DSBCS and 3561 ISBCS patients. Because of the large sample size, some statistical differences lacked clinical significance. Ocular comorbidities were slightly more prevalent in DSBCS patients. Postoperative BCVA was 20/20 or better in 48% DSBCS eyes, 49% of DSBCS second eyes, 53% of ISBCS right eyes, and 51% of ISBCS left eyes. The within-person difference in postoperative BCVA averaged zero (0.00) between the first and second DSBCS eyes, and between the ISBCS right and left eyes. After adjustment, average postoperative BCVA was better in ISBCS patients, although the difference was not statistically significant (compared with 20/20 or better: odds ratio for worse than 20/20 was 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.83-1.01). Emmetropia (spherical equivalent -0.5 to 0 was achieved 61% of first DSBCS eyes, 61% of second DSBCS eyes, 63% of ISBCS right eyes, and 63% of ISBCS left eyes. After adjustment, average postoperative RE was no different in ISBCS compared with DSBCS patients (compared with emmetropia: odds ratio for ametropia was 1.02, confidence interval 0.92-1.12). We confirmed 1 case of postoperative endophthalmitis in 10 494 ISBCS eyes (1.0 per 10 000 eyes) and 2 cases in 38 736 DSBCS eyes (0.5 per 10 000 eyes) (P = 0.6), and no patient had bilateral endophthalmitis. Compared with DSBCS, we found no evidence that ISBCS was associated with worse postoperative BCVA or RE, or with an increased Between Medication Adherence and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor Control in Elderly Patients With Diabetes The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare Star program provides incentives to health plans when their patients with diabetes meet adherence targets to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) and statins. While a link between adherence and cardiovascular risk factor control is established, most studies included young patients with few comorbidities. Whether the Star adherence target is associated with reduced blood pressure or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in complex older patients is not well understood. Determine correlates of adherence and examine the effect of meeting Star adherence targets on blood pressure and LDL-C in the Medicare-aged diabetes population. Retrospective cohort study of 129,040 patients with diabetes aged 65 or older. Adherence estimated using proportion of days covered target 0.8; blood pressure < 140/90 mg Hg; LDL-C < 100 mg/dl. Modified Poisson regression used to assess relationships. Adherence differed little across elderly age groups. Compared to no comorbidity, high comorbidity ( 4) was associated with lower ACEI/ARB (risk ratio [RR] 0.88 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-0.89]) or statin (RR 0.91 [0.90-0.92]) adherence. ACEI/ARB adherence was not associated with blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg in patients 85 years (RR 1.01 [0.96-1.07]) or with multiple comorbidities (e.g., 3: RR 1.04 [0.99-1.08]). Statin adherence and LDL-C < 100 mg/dl were associated in all elderly age groups (e.g., 85: RR 1.13 [1.09-1.16]) and comorbidity levels (e.g., 4: RR 1.13 [1.12-1.15]). Adherence to ACEI/ARB is not linked with reduced blood pressure in patients with diabetes who are at least 85 years or with multiple comorbidities. Authors: Raebel 2017 Jul 28. Innovation and Technology: Electronic Intensive Care Unit Diaries Hospitalization in the intensive care unit can be a stressful time for patients and their family members. Patients' family members often have difficulty processing all of the information that is given to them. Therefore, an intensive care unit diary can serve as a conduit for synthesizing information, maintaining connection with patients, and maintaining a connection with family members outside the intensive care unit. Paper intensive care unit diaries have been used outside the United States for many years. This article explores the development of an electronic intensive care unit diary using a rapid prototyping model to accelerate the process. Initial results of design testing demonstrate that it is feasible, useful, and desirable to consider the implementation of electronic intensive care unit diaries for patients at risk for post-intensive care syndrome.

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Program Implementation in 2 Surgical Populations in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System Novel approaches to perioperative surgical care focus on optimizing nutrition, mobility, and pain management to minimize adverse events after surgical procedures. To evaluate the outcomes of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program among 2 target populations: patients undergoing elective colorectal resection and patients undergoing emergency hip fracture repair. A pre-post difference-in-differences study before and after ERAS implementation in the target populations compared with contemporaneous surgical comparator groups (patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery and emergency orthopedic surgery). Implementation began in February and March 2014 and concluded by the end of 2014 at 20 medical centers within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated health care delivery system. A multifaceted ERAS program designed with a particular focus on perioperative pain management, mobility, nutrition, and patient engagement. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes included hospital mortality, home discharge, 30-day readmission rates, and complication rates. The study included a total of 3768 patients undergoing elective colorectal resection (mean years; 1812 [48.1%] male) and 5002 patients undergoing repair (mean [SD] age, 79.5 [11.8] years; 1586 [31.7%] male). Comparator surgical included 5556 patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery and 1523 patients undergoing emergency orthopedic surgery. Most process metrics had significantly greater changes in the ERAS target populations after implementation compared with comparator surgical populations, including those for ambulation, nutrition, and opioid use. Hospital length of stay and postoperative complication rates were also significantly lower among ERAS target populations after implementation. The rate ratios for postoperative complications were 0.68 (95% CI, 0.46-0.99; P = .04) patients undergoing resection and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.45-0.99, P = .05) for patients with hip fracture. Among patients undergoing colorectal resection, ERAS implementation was associated with decreased rates of hospital mortality (0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.86; P = .03), whereas among patients with hip fracture, implementation was associated with increased rates of home discharge (1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.44; P = .007). Multicenter implementation of an ERAS program among patients undergoing elective colorectal resection and patients undergoing emergency hip fracture repair successfully altered processes of care and was associated with significant absolute and relative decreases in hospital length of stay and postoperative complication rates. Rapid, large-scale implementation of a multidisciplinary ERAS program is feasible and effective in improving surgical outcomes. Authors: Liu in endophthalmitis Antibiotic prophylaxis in cataract surgery is intended to minimize endophthalmitis. We describe pathogenic organisms, antibiotic sensitivities and antibiotic prophylaxis in culture-proven endophthalmitis cases. Retrospective consecutive case series and community-based setting were used. Two hundred fifteen cases of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery performed during 2007-2012 in Kaiser Permanente, California. Descriptive analysis of isolated organisms and antibiotic sensitivities in relation to antibiotic prophylaxis in culture-proven endophthalmitis cases. The majority of culture-confirmed organisms (n = 83) were Gram positive (96%), most notably coagulase-negative Staphylococci (n = 34, 52%), of which all that underwent testing were sensitive to vancomycin (n = 32). Among 19 cases that had received only topical antibiotic prophylaxis, seven (37%) were resistant to the antibiotic given: 50% of cases (5 of 10 isolates) that had received ofloxacin were resistant to this antibiotic, 40% (2 of 5 isolates) that had received gatifloxacin were resistant. In contrast, 100% of cases (n = 4) that had received aminoglycosides were susceptible. Few culture-confirmed cases occurred in patients who received intracameral antibiotic (n = 4). In cases where fluoroquinolones were administered as antibiotic prophylaxis, isolates demonstrated a degree of bacterial resistance. The majority of endophthalmitis cases isolated occured following topical antibiotic prophylaxis only and were attributed to Gram-positive organisms, while few occurred in association with Feasibility Study of Supply and Demand for Diabetes Prevention Programs in North Carolina. INTRODUCTION: Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPPs) have shown that healthy eating and moderate physical activity are effective ways of delaying and preventing type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance. We assessed willingness to pay for DPPs from the perspective of potential recipients and the cost of providing these programs from the perspective of community health centers and local health departments in North Carolina.METHODS: We used contingent valuation to determine how much potential recipients would be willing to pay to participate in DPPs under 3 different models: delivered by registered professionals (traditional model), by community health workers, or online. By using information on the minimum reimbursement rate at which public health agencies would be prepared to provide the 3 models, we estimated the marginal costs per person of supplying the programs. Matching supply and demand, we estimated the degree of cost sharing between recipients and providers.RESULTS: Potential program recipients (n = 99) were willing to pay more for programs led by registered professionals than by community health workers, and they preferred face-to-face contact to an online format. Socioeconomic status (measured by education and employment) and age played the biggest roles in determining willingness to pay. Leaders of public health agencies (n = 27) reported up to a 40% difference in the cost of providing the DPP, depending on the delivery model.CONCLUSION: By using willingness to pay to understand demand for DPPs and computing the provider's marginal cost of providing these services, we can estimate cost sharing and market coverage of these services and thus compare the viability of alternate approaches to scaling up and sustaining DPPs with available resources.

Hypoglycemia Patients and Transport by EMS in Alameda County, 2013-15 To estimate the rate, characteristics, and dispositions of hypoglycemia events among persons who received care from Alameda County, California, Emergency Medical Services (EMS). This study was based on data for 601,077 Alameda County EMS encounters during 2013-15. Subjects were defined as having hypoglycemia if EMS personnel recorded a primary impression of hypoglycemia or low blood glucose (<60 mg/dl or \"unspecified low\"). The outcome of interest was patient transport or non-transport to an emergency department or other care setting; we excluded 33,177 (6%) encounters which lacked clear disposition outcomes. Among 567,900 eligible encounters, 8,332 (1.47%) were attributed to hypoglycemia, of which 1,125 (13.5%) were not transported. Non-transport was more likely among males, adult patients age <60, initial blood glucose >60 mg/dl or EMS arrival time 18:00-6:00. Without an understanding of EMS encounters and non-transport rates, surveillance based solely on emergency department and hospital data will significantly underestimate rates of severe hypoglycemia. Additionally, given that hypoglycemia is often safely and effectively treated by non-physicians, EMS protocols should provide guidance for non-transport of hypoglycemic patients whose blood glucose levels have Association Between Neighborhood Supermarket Presence and Glycated Hemoglobin Levels Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus We estimated associations between neighborhood supermarket gain or loss and glycemic control (assessed by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values) in patients from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry (n = 434,806 person-years; 2007-2010). Annual clinical measures were linked to metrics from a geographic information system for each patient's address of longest residence. We estimated the association between change in supermarket presence (gain, loss, or no change) and change in HbA1c value, adjusting for individual- and area-level attributes and according to baseline glycemic control (near normal, <6.5%; good, 6.5%-7.9%; moderate, 8.0%-8.9%; and poor, 9.0%). Supermarket loss was associated with worse HbA1c trajectories for those with good, moderate, and poor glycemic control at baseline, while supermarket gain was associated with marginally better HbA1c outcomes only among patients with near normal HbA1c values at baseline. Patients with the poorest baseline HbA1c values (9.0%) had the worst associated changes in glycemic control following either supermarket loss or gain. Differences were not clinically meaningful relative to no change in supermarket presence. For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, gaining neighborhood supermarket presence did not benefit glycemic control in a substantive way. The significance of supermarket changes on health depends on a complex interaction of resident, neighborhood, and store characteristics. Authors: Zhang Epidemiol. 2017 Jun 15;185(12):1297-1303. Effects of acute exercise on fear extinction in rats and exposure therapy in humans: Null findings from five experiments. BACKGROUND: Exposure therapy is an established learning-based intervention for the treatment of anxiety disorders with an average response rate of nearly 50%, leaving room for improvement. Emerging strategies to enhance exposure therapy in humans and fear extinction retention in animal models are primarily pharmacological. These approaches are limited as many patients report preferring non-pharmacological approaches in therapy. With general cognitive enhancement effects, exercise has emerged as a plausible non-pharmacological augmentation strategy. The present study tested the hypothesis that fear extinction and exposure therapy would be enhanced by a pre-training bout of exercise. METHODS: We conducted four experiments with rats that involved a standardized conditioning and extinction paradigm and a manipulation of exercise. In a fifth experiment, we manipulated vigorous-intensity exercise prior to a standardized virtual reality exposure therapy session among adults with fear of heights. RESULTS: In experiments 1-4, exercise did not facilitate fear extinction, long-term memory, or fear relapse tests. In experiment 5, human participants showed an overall reduction in fear of heights but exercise did not enhance symptom improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Although acute exercise prior to fear extinction or exposure therapy, as operationalized in the present 5 studies, did not enhance outcomes, these results must be interpreted within the context of a broader literature that includes positive findings. Taken all together, this suggests that more research is necessary to identify optimal parameters and key individual differences so that exercise can be implemented successfully to treat anxiety disorders. 2017 Jun 4. The Diabetes Strengths and Resilience Measure for Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes (DSTAR-Teen): Validation of a New, Brief Self-Report Measure. OBJECTIVE: Despite the challenges of managing type 1 diabetes, many adolescents achieve optimal outcomes. A validated measure of diabetes-specific strengths is needed to measure adaptive behaviors and attitudes associated with overcoming challenges and achieving \"resilient\" outcomes. Baseline data from 260 adolescents (age 14-18 years, M = 15.7 \u00b1 1.1, 60% female, 33% Non-Caucasian, M A1c = 9.1 \u00b1 1.9%) and caregivers in a behavioral intervention trial were analyzed to evaluate psychometric properties of the 12-item self-report Diabetes Strengths and Resilience measure for adolescents (DSTAR-Teen). Reliability and validity were examined in relation to measures of related constructs, regimen adherence, and glycemic outcomes, and confirmatory factor analysis was conducted. Reliability was good (internal consistency: = .89; item-total correlations: r range = .55-.78). Significant correlations demonstrated construct and criterion validity. A two-factor structure reflecting intrapersonal and interpersonal processes fit the data better than a one-factor solution. The DSTAR-Teen has strong psychometric properties, captures adaptive aspects of adolescents' diabetes management (i.e., \"strengths\"), and is related [Epub of print] Concurrent Treatment with Prolonged Exposure for Co-Occurring Full or Subthreshold Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Substance Use Disorders: A Randomized Clinical Trial. BACKGROUND: To test whether an integrated prolonged exposure (PE) approach could address posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms effectively in individuals with co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD), we compared concurrent treatment of PTSD and SUD using PE (COPE) to relapse prevention therapy (RPT) for SUD and an active monitoring control group (AMCG). METHODS: We conducted a randomized 12-week trial with participants (n = 110; 64% males; 59% African Americans) who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision criteria for full or subthreshold PTSD and SUD. Participants were randomly assigned to COPE (n = 39), RPT (n = 43), or AMCG (n = 28). RESULTS: At the end-of-treatment, COPE and RPT demonstrated greater reduction in PTSD symptom severity relative to AMCG (COPE-AMCG = -34.06, p < 0.001; RPT-AMCG = -22.58, p = 0.002). Although the difference between COPE and RPT was not significant in the complete sample, the subset of participants with full (vs. subthreshold) PTSD demonstrated significantly greater reduction of PTSD severity in COPE relative to RPT. Both treatments were superior to AMCG in reducing the days of primary substance use (COPE-AMCG = -0.97, p = 0.01; RPT-AMCG = -2.07, p < 0.001). Relative to COPE, RPT showed significantly more improvement in SUD outcome at end-of-treatment (RPT-COPE = -1.10, p = 0.047). At 3-month follow-up, COPE and RPT maintained their treatment gains and were not significantly different in PTSD severity or days of primary substance use. CONCLUSION: COPE and RPT reduced PTSD and SUD severity in participants with PTSD + SUD. Findings suggest that among those with full PTSD, COPE improves PTSD symptoms more than a SUD-only treatment. The use of PE for PTSD was associated with significant decreases in PTSD symptoms without worsening of substance difference in medical trainees' attitudes toward Latino patients: A pilot study of an intervention to modify implicit and explicit attitudes. Negative attitudes and discrimination against Latinos exist in the dominant U.S. culture and in healthcare systems, contributing to ongoing health disparities. This article provides findings of a pilot test of Yo Veo Salud (I See Health), an intervention designed to positively modify attitudes toward Latinos among medical trainees. The research question was: Compared to the comparison group, did the intervention group show lower levels of implicit bias against Latinos versus Whites, and higher levels of ethnocultural empathy, healthcare empathy, and patient-centeredness? We used a sequential cohort, post-test design to evaluate Yo Veo Salud with a sample of 69 medical trainees. The intervention setting was an academic medical institution in a Southeastern U.S. state with a fast-growing Latino population. The intervention was delivered, and data were collected online, between July and December of 2014. Participants in the intervention group showed greater ethnocultural empathy, healthcare empathy, and patient-centeredness, compared to the comparison group. The implicit measure assessed four attitudinal dimensions (pleasantness, responsibility, compliance, and safety). Comparisons between our intervention and comparison groups did not find any average differences in implicit anti-Latino bias between the groups. However, in a subset analysis of White participants, White participants in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly decreased level of implicit bias in terms of pleasantness. A dose response was also founded indicating that participants involved in more parts of the intervention showed more change on all measures. Our findings, while modest in size, provide proof of concept for Yo Veo Salud as a means for increasing ethno-cultural and physician empathy, and patient-centeredness among medical residents and decreasing implicit provider bias toward Latinos.

Food Environment and Weight Change: Does Residential Mobility Matter?: The Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) Associations between neighborhood food environment and adult body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) derived using cross-sectional or longitudinal random-effects models may be biased due to unmeasured confounding and measurement and methodological limitations. In this study, we assessed the within-individual association between change in food environment from 2006 to 2011 and change in BMI among adults with type 2 diabetes using clinical data from the Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Registry collected from 2007 to 2011. Healthy food environment was measured using the kernel density of healthful food venues. Fixed-effects models with a 1-year-lagged BMI were estimated. Separate models were fitted for persons who moved and those who did not. Sensitivity analysis using different lag times and kernel density bandwidths were tested to establish the consistency of findings. On average, patients lost 1 pound (0.45 kg) for each standard-deviation improvement in their food environment. This relationship held for persons who remained in the same location throughout the 5-year study period but not among persons who moved. Proximity to food venues that promote nutritious foods alone may not translate into clinically meaningful diet-related health changes. Community-level policies for improving the food environment need multifaceted strategies to invoke clinically meaningful change in BMI among adult patients with diabetes. Authors: Laraia BA; Population Health Management for Diabetes: Health Care System-Level Approaches for Improving Quality and Addressing Disparities Population care approaches for diabetes have the potential to improve the quality of care and decrease diabetes-related mortality and morbidity. Population care strategies are particularly relevant as accountable care organizations (ACOs), patient-centered medical homes (PCMH), and integrated delivery systems are increasingly focused on managing chronic disease care at the health system level. This review outlines the key elements of population care approaches for diabetes in the current health care environment. Population care approaches proactively identify diabetes patients through disease registries and electronic health record data and utilize multidisciplinary care teams, personalized provider feedback, and decision support tools to target and care for patients at risk for poor outcomes. Existing evidence suggests that these strategies can improve care outcomes and potentially ameliorate existing race/ethnic disparities in health care. However, such strategies may be less effective for patients who are disengaged from the health care system. As population care for diabetes continues to evolve, future initiatives should consider ways to tailor population care to meet individual patient needs, while leveraging improvements in clinical information systems and care integration to optimally manage and prevent diabetes in the Rep. 2017 May;17(5):31. High rates of severe hypoglycemia among African American patients with diabetes: the surveillance, prevention, and Management of Diabetes Mellitus (SUPREME-DM) network Seven-year surveillance study (2005-2011) to evaluate race/ethnic differences in the trends in rates of severe hypoglycemia (SH) in a population of insured, at-risk adults with diabetes. SH events were identified via any primary or principal diagnosis from emergency department or inpatient encounters among African American, Asian, Latino and White adult diabetes patients treated with insulin or secretagogues (Sulfonylureas or Meglitinides), receiving care from integrated healthcare delivery systems across the United States. We calculated age- and sex-standardized annual SH rates and average annual percent change (AAPC) in SH rates. Annual SH rates ranged from 1.8% to 2.1% during this 7-year observation period (2,200,471 person-years). African Americans had consistently higher SH rates compared with Whites, while Latinos and Asians had consistently lower rates compared with Whites in each of the 7 years (all p < 0.01). The trend increased significantly only among African Americans (AAPC = +4.3%; 95% CI: +2.1, +6.5%); in the other groups, the AAPC was not significantly different from zero. Surveillance efforts should monitor the racial/ethnic-specific rates. The factors underlying substantially higher rates of hypoglycemia in African Americans should be evaluated. Clinically and culturally-appropriate strategies to reduce the risk of SH need to be developed and tested. Authors: Karter AJ; SUPREME-DM May;31(5):869-873. Epub 2017-02-21. Association of the Affordable Care Act With Smoking and Tobacco Treatment Utilization Among Adults Newly Enrolled in Health Care To examine rates of smoking and tobacco treatment utilization by insurance coverage status (Medicaid, commercial, exchange) among newly enrolled patients in the post Affordable Care Act (ACA) era. We examined new members who enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California through Medicaid, the California exchange, or nonexchange commercial plans (N=122,298) in the first 6 months of 2014 following ACA implementation. We compared these groups on smoking prevalence and tested whether smokers in each group differed on sociodemographic characteristics and in their utilization of tobacco treatment (pharmacotherapy and counseling) in 2014. Smoking prevalence was higher among Medicaid (22%) than exchange (13%) or commercial (12%) patients (P<0.0001). Controlling for key sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, Medicaid (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-1.73) smokers had greater odds of tobacco treatment use than commercial smokers. Other groups at risk for underuse included men, younger patients, Asians, and Latinos. In this cohort of newly enrolled patients after ACA implementation, Medicaid patients were more likely to be smokers compared with exchange and commercial patients, but they were also more likely to use tobacco treatment. Low tobacco treatment use among exchange and commercial plan smokers, as well as younger men, Asians and Latinos poses a significant obstacle to improving public health and additional targeted outreach strategies may be needed to engage these patients with available health services. 2017 May;55(5):535-541. Reducing Out-of-Pocket Costs to Coordinate Prescription Medication Benefit Design with Chronic Disease Outreach and Clinical Care Authors: Reed M J Gen Intern Med. 2017 05;32(5):495-496. Shared decision making in contraceptive counseling Shared decision making (SDM) is a potentially valuable but underexplored approach to contraceptive counseling. We determined the correlation between patient report of SDM and of whether their provider had a method preference with measures of satisfaction. Women reporting SDM were more likely to be satisfied with counseling than those reporting a provider-driven decision and were more likely to be satisfied with their method than those reporting a patient-driven decision. Patients who felt that the provider had a method preference were less likely to be satisfied with their method. SDM in contraceptive counseling is associated with Pain Management Following Implementation of a Geriatric Hip Fracture Program. INTRODUCTION: Over 300,000 patients in the United States sustain low-trauma fragility hip fractures annually. Multidisciplinary geriatric fracture programs (GFP) including early, multimodal pain management reduce morbidity and mortality. Our overall goal was to determine the effects of a GFP on the emergency department (ED) pain management of geriatric fragility hip fractures. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study including patients age >/=65 years with fragility hip fractures two years before and two years after the implementation of the GFP. Outcomes were time to (any) first analgesic, use of acetaminophen and fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) in the ED, and amount of opioid medication administered in the first 24 hours. We used permutation tests to evaluate differences in ED pain management following GFP implementation. RESULTS: We studied 131 patients in the pre-GFP period and 177 patients in the post-GFP period. In the post-GFP period, more patients received FICB p<0.001) in the ED. Patients in the post-GFP period also had a shorter time to first analgesic (103 vs. 93 minutes; p=0.04) and received fewer morphine equivalents in the first 24 hours (15mg vs. 10mg, p<0.001) than patients in the pre-GFP period. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a GFP was associated with improved ED pain management for geriatric patients with fragility hip fractures. Future studies should evaluate the effects of these changes in pain management on longer-term outcomes. Epub 2017 Apr Approach to the Management of Neonatal Early-Onset Sepsis Current algorithms for management of neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) result in medical intervention for large numbers of uninfected infants. We developed multivariable prediction models for estimating the risk of EOS among late preterm and term infants based on objective data available at birth and the newborn's clinical status. To examine the effect of neonatal EOS risk prediction models on sepsis evaluations and antibiotic use and assess their safety in a large integrated health care system. The study cohort includes 204 485 infants born at 35 weeks' gestation or later at a Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospital from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2015. The study compared 3 periods when EOS management was based on (1) national recommended guidelines (baseline period [January 1, 2010, through November 31, 2012]), (2) multivariable estimates of sepsis risk at birth (learning period [December 1, 2012, through June 30, 2014]), and (3) the multivariable risk estimate combined with the infant's clinical condition in the first 24 hours after birth (EOS calculator period [July 1, 2014, through December 31, 2015]). The primary outcome was antibiotic administration in the first 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included blood culture use, antibiotic administration between 24 and 72 hours, clinical outcomes, and readmissions for EOS. The study cohort included 204 485 infants born at 35 weeks' gestation or later: 95 343 in the baseline period (mean [SD] age, 39.4 [1.3] weeks; 46 651 male [51.0%]; 37 007 white, non-Hispanic [38.8%]), 52 881 in the learning period (mean [SD] age, 39.3 [1.3] weeks; 27 067 male [51.2%]; 20 175 white, non-Hispanic [38.2%]), and 56 261 in the EOS calculator period (mean [SD] age, 39.4 [1.3] weeks; 28 575 male [50.8%]; 20 484 white, non-Hispanic [36.4%]). In a comparison of the baseline period with the EOS calculator period, blood culture use decreased from 14.5% to 4.9% (adjusted difference, -7.7%; 95% CI, -13.1% to -2.4%). Empirical antibiotic administration in the first 24 hours decreased from 5.0% to 2.6% (adjusted difference, -1.8; 95% CI, -2.4% to -1.3%). No increase in antibiotic use occurred between 24 and 72 hours after birth; use decreased from 0.5% to 0.4% (adjusted difference, 0.0%; 95% CI, -0.1% to 0.2%). The incidence of culture-confirmed EOS was similar during the 3 periods (0.03% in the baseline period, 0.03% in the learning period, and 0.02% in the EOS calculator period). Readmissions for EOS (within 7 days of birth) were rare in all periods (5.2 per 100 000 births in the baseline period, 1.9 per 100 000 births in the learning period, and 5.3 per 100 000 births in the EOS calculator period) and did not differ statistically (P = .70). Incidence of adverse clinical outcomes, including need for inotropes, mechanical ventilation, meningitis, and death, was unchanged after introduction of the EOS calculator. Clinical care algorithms based on individual infant estimates of EOS risk derived from a multivariable risk prediction model reduced the proportion of newborns undergoing laboratory testing and receiving empirical antibiotic treatment without apparent adverse effects.

Primary care visit preparation and communication for patients with poorly controlled diabetes: A qualitative study of patients and physicians The purpose of this study was to examine how patients with diabetes and their primary care physicians identify and discuss visit priorities prior to and during visits. We conducted a qualitative study involving patients with diabetes (4 focus groups, n=29) and primary care physicians (6 provider practice meeting discussions, n=67). Four key themes related to prioritization were identified: 1) the value of identifying visit priorities before the visit; 2) challenges to negotiating priorities during the time-limited visit; 3) the importance of \"non-medical\" priorities; and 4) the need for strategies to help patients prepare for visits. Both patients and physicians felt that identifying a concise list of key priorities in advance of the visit could help establish collaborative visit agendas and treatment plans. Identifying and communicating mutually agreed upon priorities for discussion is a key challenge for time-limited primary care visits. Communication between primary care physicians and their patients with diabetes could be improved by strategies that help patients identify their top visit priorities before the visit.

Natural language processing to ascertain two key variables from operative reports in ophthalmology Antibiotic prophylaxis is critical to ophthalmology and other surgical specialties. We performed natural language processing (NLP) of 743 838 operative notes recorded for 315 246 surgeries to ascertain two variables needed to study the comparative effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in cataract surgery. The first key variable was an exposure variable, intracameral antibiotic injection. The second was an intraoperative complication, posterior capsular rupture (PCR), which functioned as a potential confounder. To help other researchers use NLP in their settings, we describe our NLP protocol and lessons learned. For each of the two variables, we used SAS Text Miner and other SAS text-processing modules with a training set of 10 000 (1.3%) operative notes to develop a lexicon. The lexica identified misspellings, abbreviations, and negations, and linked words into concepts (e.g. \"antibiotic\" linked with \"injection\"). We confirmed the NLP tools by iteratively obtaining random samples of 2000 (0.3%) notes, with replacement. The NLP tools identified approximately 60 000 intracameral antibiotic injections and 3500 cases of PCR. The positive and negative predictive values for intracameral antibiotic injection exceeded 99%. For the intraoperative complication, they exceeded 94%. NLP was a valid and feasible method for obtaining critical variables needed for a research study of surgical safety. These NLP tools were intended for use in the study sample. Use with external datasets or future datasets in our own setting would require further testing. Copyright \u00a9 2017 John Wiley the Great Recession: Was the Foreclosure Crisis Harmful to the Health of Individuals With Diabetes? The housing foreclosure crisis was harmful to the financial well-being of many households. In the present study, we investigated the health effects of the housing foreclosure crisis on glycemic control within a population of patients with diabetes. We hypothesized that an increase in the neighborhood foreclosure rate could worsen glycemic control by activating stressors such as higher neighborhood crime, lower housing prices, and erosion of neighborhood social cohesion. To test this, we linked public foreclosure records at the census-block level with clinical records from 2006 to 2009 of patients with diabetes. We specified individual fixed-effects models and controlled for individual time-invariant confounders and area-level time-varying confounders, including housing prices and unemployment rate, to estimate the effect of the foreclosure rate per census-block group on glycated hemoglobin. We found no statistically significant relationship between changes in the neighborhood foreclosure rate per block group in the prior year and changes in glycated hemoglobin. There is no evidence that increased foreclosure rates worsened glycemic control in this continuously insured population with diabetes. More research is needed to inform our knowledge of the role of insurance and health-care delivery systems in protecting the health of diabetic patients during times of economic stress. Authors: Downing J; Racial-Ethnic Differences in Fall Prevalence among Older Women: A Cross-Sectional Survey Study Falls are the leading cause of hip fracture in older women, with important public health implications. Fall risk increases with age and other clinical factors, and varies by race/ethnicity. International studies suggest that fall risk is lower in Asians, although data are limited in U.S. This study examines racial/ethnic differences in fall prevalence among older U.S. women within a large integrated healthcare delivery system. This cross-sectional study used data from 6277 women ages 65-90 who responded to the 2008 or 2011 Kaiser Permanente Northern California Member Health Survey (KPNC-MHS). The KPNC-MHS is a mailed questionnaire sent to a random sample of adult members stratified by age, gender, and geographic location, representing a population estimate of >200,000 women age 65 years. Age, race/ethnicity, self-reported health status, presence of diabetes, arthritis or prior stroke, mobility limitations and number of falls in the past year were obtained from the KPNC-MHS. The independent association of race/ethnicity and recent falls was examined, adjusting for known risk factors. The weighted sample was 76.7% non-Hispanic white, 6.2% Hispanic, 6.8% black and 10.3% Asian. Over 20% reported having fallen during the past year (28.5% non-Hispanic white, 27.8% Hispanic, 23.4% black and 20.1% Asian). Older age was associated with greater fall risk, as was having diabetes (OR 1.24, CI 1.03-1.48), prior stroke (OR 1.51, CI 1.09-2.07), arthritis (OR 1.61, CI 1.39-1.85) and mobility limitations (OR 2.82, CI 2.34-3.39), adjusted for age. Compared to whites, Asian (OR 0.64, CI 0.50-0.81) and black (OR 0.73, CI 0.55-0.95) women were much less likely to have 1 fall in the past year, adjusting for age, comorbidities, mobility limitation and poor health status. Asians were also less likely to have 2 falls (OR 0.62, CI 0.43-0.88). Among older women, the risk of having a recent fall was substantially lower for black and Asian women when compared to white women. This may contribute to their lower rates of hip fracture. Future studies should examine cultural and behavioral factors that contribute to these observed racial/ethnic differences in fall risk among U.S. women. Authors: Geng Lo association turnover (the \"July Effect\") and survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest. IMPORTANCE: The July Effect refers to adverse outcomes that occur as a result of turnover of the physician workforce in teaching hospitals during the month of June.OBJECTIVE: As a surrogate for physician turnover, we used a multivariable difference-in-difference approach to determine if there was a difference in outcomes between May and July in teaching versus non-teaching hospitals.DESIGN: We used prospectively collected observational data from United States hospitals participating in the Get With The Guidelines\u00ae-Resuscitation registry. Participants were adults with index in-hospital cardiac arrest between 2005-2014. They were a priori divided by location of arrest (general medical/surgical ward, intensive care unit, emergency department). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included neurological outcome at discharge, return of spontaneous circulation, and several process measures.RESULTS: We analyzed 16,328 patients in intensive care units, 11,275 in general medical/surgical wards and 3790 in emergency departments. Patient characteristics were similar between May and July in both teaching and non-teaching hospitals. The models for intensive care unit patients indicated the presence of a July Effect with the difference-in-difference ranging between 1.9-3.1%, which reached statistical significance (p0.20 for all models).CONCLUSIONS: There may be a July Effect in the intensive care unit but the results were mixed. Most survival models showed a statistically significant difference but this was not supported by the secondary analyses of return of spontaneous circulation and neurological outcome. We found no July Effect in the emergency department or the medical/surgical ward for patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Authors: Myers, Identifying attendance patterns in a smoking cessation treatment and their relationships with quit success. BACKGROUND: While important for substance use outcomes, knowledge about treatment attendance patterns, and their relation with clinical outcomes is limited. We examined the association between attendance patterns and smoking outcomes in a randomized, controlled smoking cessation intervention trial. METHODS: In addition to standard smoking cessation treatment, participants were randomized to 15 weeks of an exercise intervention (n=72) or an education control condition (n=64). Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) tested whether intervention attendance would be better modeled as qualitatively distinct attendance patterns rather than as a single mean pattern. Multivariate generalized linear mixed modeling (GLMM) was used to evaluate associations between the attendance patterns and abstinence at the end of treatment and at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: The LCGA solution with three patterns characterized by high probability of attendance throughout (Completers, 46.3%), gradual decreasing probability of attendance (Titrators, 23.5%), and high probability of dropout within the first few weeks (Droppers, 30.1%) provided the best fit. The GLMM analysis indicated an interaction of attendance pattern by treatment condition, such that titration was associated with lower probability of quit success for those in the control condition. Probability of quit success was not significantly different between Titrators and Completers in the exercise condition. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of examining how treatment efficacy may vary as a function of attendance patterns. Importantly, treatment discontinuation is not necessarily indicative of poorer abstinence outcome. Authors: Epub 2017 Mar 6. Defining Team Effort Involved in Patient Care from the Primary Care Physician's Perspective A better understanding of the attributes of patients who require more effort to manage may improve risk adjustment approaches and lead to more efficient resource allocation, improved patient care and health outcomes, and reduced burnout in primary care clinicians. To identify and characterize high-effort patients from the physician's perspective. Cohort study. Ninety-nine primary care physicians in an academic primary care network. From a list of 100 randomly selected patients in their panels, PCPs identified patients who required a high level of team-based effort and patients they considered complex. For high-effort patients, PCPs indicated which factors influenced their decision: medical/care coordination, behavioral health, and/or socioeconomic factors. We examined differences in patient characteristics based on PCP-defined effort and complexity. Among 9594 eligible patients, PCPs classified 2277 (23.7 %) as high-effort and 2676 (27.9 %) as complex. Behavioral health issues were the major driver of effort in younger patients, while medical/care coordination issues predominated in older patients. Compared to low-effort patients, high-effort patients were significantly (P < 0.01 for all) more likely to have higher rates of medical (e.g. 23.2 % vs. 6.3 % for diabetes) and behavioral health problems (e.g. 9.8 % vs. 2.9 % for substance use disorder), more frequent primary care visits (10.9 vs. 6.0 visits), and higher acute care utilization rates (25.8 % vs. 7.7 % for emergency department [ED] visits and 15.0 % vs. 3.9 % for hospitalization). Almost one in five (18 %) patients who were considered high-effort were not deemed complex by the same PCPs. Patients defined as high-effort by their primary care physicians, not all of whom were medically complex, appear to have a high burden of psychosocial issues that may not be accounted for in current chronic disease-focused risk adjustment approaches.

Improvements in access and care through the Affordable Care Act To examine the impact of enrolling in a healthcare plan through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) healthcare exchanges on self-reported access to care. Cohort study using self-reported data of patients newly enrolled in Kaiser Permanente California and Kaiser Permanente Colorado through the ACA healthcare exchanges for coverage beginning January 1, 2014. Baseline and follow-up surveys conducted via mail and telephone, with response rates of 45% and 51%, respectively. We found significant increases in the percentage of people who reported having a personal healthcare provider (59% vs 73%; P <.01) and significant decreases in those who reported delaying needed medical care due to costs (37% vs 25%; P <.01) before and after ACA enrollment. There was also a significant increase in the percentage of patients who reported receiving a flu shot during the prior year (41% vs 52%; P <.01). Among the people who reported having less than 4 months of healthcare coverage in 2013, these improvements were even more pronounced. This group also showed significant increases in the percentages who felt they had a place to go when they needed medical care (43% vs 56%; P <.01) and who reported they received advice to quit smoking or using tobacco (46% vs 72%; P <.05). These findings are an important addition to the evidence base that the ACA is improving the healthcare experience and reducing barriers due to costs for individuals obtaining insurance coverage through the healthcare exchanges.

Failure Modes and Effects Analysis of bilateral same-day cataract surgery To systematically analyze potential process failures related to bilateral same-day cataract surgery toward the goal of improving patient safety. Twenty-one Kaiser Permanente surgery centers, Northern California, USA. Retrospective cohort study. Quality experts performed a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) that included an evaluation of sterile processing, pharmaceuticals, perioperative clinic and surgical center visits, and biometry. Potential failures in human factors and communication (modes) were identified. Rates of endophthalmitis, toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS), and unintended intraocular lens (IOL) implantation were assessed in eyes having bilateral same-day surgery from 2010 through 2014. The study comprised 4754 eyes. The analysis identified 15 significant potential failure modes. These included lapses in instrument processing and compounding errors of intracameral antibiotics that could lead to endophthalmitis or TASS, and ambiguous documentation of IOL selection by surgeons, which could lead to unintended IOL implantation. Of the study sample, 1 eye developed endophthalmitis, 1 eye had unintended IOL implantation (rates, 2 per 10 000; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1-12.0 per 10 000), and no eyes developed TASS (upper 95% CI, 8 per 10 000). Recommendations included improving oversight of cleaning and sterilization practices, separating lots of compounded drugs for each eye, and enhancing IOL verification procedures. Potential failure modes and recommended actions in bilateral same-day cataract surgery were determined using an FMEA. These findings might help improve the reliability and safety of bilateral same-day cataract surgery based on current evidence and Insurance Design Benefit Offsets Reductions In Medication Adherence Associated With Switch To Deductible Plan Enrollment in high-deductible health plans is increasing out-of-pocket spending. But innovative plans that pair deductibles with value-based insurance designs can help preserve low-cost access to high-value treatments for patients by aligning coverage with clinical value. Among adults in high-deductible health plans who were prescribed medications for chronic conditions, we examined what impact a value-based pharmacy benefit that offered free chronic disease medications had on medication adherence. Overall, we found that the value-based plan offset reductions in medication adherence associated with switching to a deductible plan. The value-based plan appeared particularly beneficial for patients who started with low levels of medication adherence. Patients with additional clinical complexity or vulnerable populations living in neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic status, however, did not show adherence improvements and might not be taking advantage of value-based insurance design provisions. Additional efforts may be needed to educate patients about their nuanced benefit plans to help overcome initial confusion about these complex plans.

Adherence to Newly Prescribed Diabetes Medications Among Insured Latino and White Patients With Diabetes Medication adherence is essential to diabetes care. Patient-physician language barriers may affect medication adherence among Latino individuals. To determine the association of patient race/ethnicity, preferred language, and physician language concordance with patient adherence to newly prescribed diabetes medications. This observational study was conducted from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2012, at a large integrated health care delivery system with professional interpreter services. Insured patients with type 2 diabetes, including English-speaking white, English-speaking Latino, or limited English proficiency (LEP) Latino patients with newly prescribed diabetes medication. Patient race/ethnicity, preferred language, and physician self-reported Spanish-language fluency. Primary nonadherence (never dispensed), early-stage nonpersistence (dispensed only once), late-stage nonpersistence (received 2 dispensings, but discontinued within 24 months), and inadequate overall medication adherence (>20% time without sufficient medication supply during 24 months after initial prescription). Participants included 21 878 white patients, 5755 English-speaking Latino patients, and 3205 LEP Latino patients with a total of 46 131 prescriptions for new diabetes medications. Among LEP Latino patients, 50.2% (n = 1610) had a primary care physician reporting high Spanish fluency. For oral medications, early adherence varied substantially: 1032 LEP Latino patients (32.2%), 1565 English-speaking Latino patients and 4004 white patients (18.3%) were either primary nonadherent or early nonpersistent. Inadequate overall adherence was observed in 1929 LEP Latino patients (60.2%), 2975 English-speaking Latino patients (51.7%), and For insulin, early-stage nonpersistence was 42.8% among LEP Latino patients (n = 1372), 34.4% among English-speaking Latino patients (n = 1980), and 28.5% among white patients (n = 6235). After adjustment for patient and physician characteristics, LEP Latino patients were more likely to be nonadherent to oral medications and insulin than English-speaking Latino patients (relative risks from 1.11 [95% CI, 1.06-1.15] to 1.17 [95% CI, 1.02-1.34]; P < .05) or white patients (relative risks from 1.36 [95% CI, 1.31-1.41] to 1.49 [95% CI, 1.32-1.69]; P < .05). English-speaking Latino patients were more likely to be nonadherent compared with white patients (relative risks from 1.23 [95% CI, 1.19-1.27] to 1.30 [95% CI, 1.23-1.39]; P < .05). Patient-physician language concordance was not associated with rates of nonadherence among LEP Latinos (relative risks from 0.92 [95% CI, 0.71-1.19] to 1.04 [95% CI, 0.97-1.1]; P > .28). Nonadherence to newly prescribed diabetes medications is substantially greater among Latino than white patients, even among English-speaking Latino patients. Limited English proficiency Latino patients are more likely to be nonadherent than English-speaking Latino patients independent of the Spanish-language fluency of their physicians. Interventions beyond access to interpreters or patient-physician language concordance will be required to improve medication adherence among Latino patients with diabetes. Authors: Language Concordance and Glycemic Control for Limited-English Proficiency Latinos With Type 2 Diabetes Providing culturally competent care to the growing number of limited-English proficiency (LEP) Latinos with diabetes in the United States is challenging. To evaluate changes in risk factor control among LEP Latinos with diabetes who switched from language-discordant (English-only) primary care physicians (PCPs) to language-concordant (Spanish-speaking) vice versa. This pre-post, difference-in-differences study selected 1605 adult patients with diabetes who self-identified as Latino, whose preferred language was Spanish, and who switched PCPs between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2013. Study participants were members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care system (an integrated health care delivery system with access to bilingual PCPs and/or professional interpreter services). Spanish-speaking and English-only PCPs were identified by self-report or utilization data. Change in patient-PCP language concordance after switching PCPs. Glycemic > low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) control (LDL < 100 mg/dL), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) control (SBP < 140 mm Hg). Overall, 1605 LEP Latino adults with diabetes (mean [SD] age, 60.5 [13.1] years) were included in this study, and there was a significant net improvement in glycemic and LDL control among patients who switched from language-discordant PCPs to concordant PCPs relative to those who switched from one discordant PCP to another discordant PCP. After adjustment and accounting for secular trends, the prevalence of glycemic control increased by 10% (95% CI, 2% to 17%; P = .01), poor control decreased by 4% (95% CI, -10% to 2%; P = .16) and LDL control increased by 9% (95% CI, 1% to 17%; P = .03). No significant changes were observed in SBP control. Prevalence of LDL control increased 15% (95% CI, 7% to 24%; P < .001) among LEP Latinos who switched from concordant to discordant PCPs. Risk factor control did not worsen following a PCP switch in any group. We observed significant improvements in glycemic control among LEP Latino patients with diabetes who switched from language-discordant to concordant PCPs. Facilitating language-concordant care may be a strategy for diabetes management among LEP Latinos. Telephone-Based Coaching: A Comparison of Tobacco Cessation Programs in an Integrated Health Care System Many Americans continue to smoke, increasing their risk of disease and premature death. Both telephone-based counseling and in-person tobacco cessation classes may improve access for smokers seeking convenient support to quit. Little research has assessed whether such programs are effective in real-world clinical populations. Retrospective cohort study comparing wellness coaching participants with two groups of controls. Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care delivery system. Two hundred forty-one patients who participated in telephonic tobacco cessation coaching from January 1, 2011, to March 31, 2012, and two control groups: propensity-score-matched controls, and controls who participated in a tobacco cessation class during the same period. Wellness coaching participants received an average of two motivational interviewing-based coaching sessions that engaged the patient, evoked their reason to consider quitting, and helped them establish a quit plan. Self-reported quitting of tobacco and fills of tobacco cessation medications within 12 months of follow-up. Logistic regressions adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and primary language. After adjusting for confounders, tobacco quit rates were higher among coaching participants vs. matched controls (31% vs. 23%, p < .001) and comparable to those of class attendees (31% vs. 29%, p = .28). Coaching participants and class attendees filled tobacco-cessation prescriptions at a higher rate (47% for both) than matched controls (6%, p < .001). Telephonic wellness coaching was as effective as in-person classes and was associated with higher rates of quitting compared to no treatment. The telephonic modality may increase convenience and scalability for health care systems looking to reduce tobacco use and improve health. Authors: Epub 2016-11-18.

Impact of Cannabis Use on Treatment Outcomes among Adults Receiving Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for PTSD and Substance Use Disorders. BACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated a strong link between trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD and substance use disorders (SUDs) in general and cannabis use disorders in particular. Yet, few studies have examined the impact of cannabis use on treatment outcomes for individuals with co-occurring PTSD and SUDs. METHODS: Participants were 136 individuals who cognitive-behavioral therapies for co-occurring PTSD and SUD. Multivariate regressions were utilized to examine the associations between baseline cannabis use and end-of-treatment outcomes. Multilevel linear growth models were fit to the data to examine the cross-lagged associations between weekly cannabis use and weekly PTSD symptom severity and primary substance use during treatment. RESULTS: There were no significant positive nor negative associations between baseline cannabis use and end-of-treatment PTSD symptom severity and days of primary substance use. Cross-lagged models revealed that as cannabis use increased, subsequent primary substance use decreased and vice versa. Moreover, results revealed a crossover lagged effect, whereby higher cannabis use was associated with greater PTSD symptom severity early in treatment, but lower weekly PTSD symptom severity later in treatment. CONCLUSION: Cannabis use was not associated with adverse outcomes in end-of-treatment PTSD and primary substance use, suggesting independent pathways of change. The theoretical and clinical implications of the reciprocal associations between weekly cannabis use and subsequent PTSD and primary substance use symptoms during treatment are 10.3390/jcm6020014. Response to Comment on Pathak et al. Severe Hypoglycemia Requiring Medical Intervention in a Large Cohort of Adults With Diabetes Receiving Care in U.S. Integrated Health Care Delivery Systems: in Survivors: Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2017 02;14(2):170-171. Evaluating Frameworks That Provide Value Measures for Health Care Interventions The recent acceleration of scientific discovery has led to greater choices in health care. New technologies, diagnostic tests, and pharmaceuticals have widely varying impact on patients and populations in terms of benefits, toxicities, and costs, stimulating a resurgence of interest in the creation of frameworks intended to measure value in health. Many of these are offered by providers and/or advocacy organizations with expertise and interest in specific diseases (e.g., cancer and heart disease). To help assess the utility of and the potential biases embedded in these frameworks, we created an evaluation taxonomy with seven basic components: 1) define the purpose; 2) detail the conceptual approach, including perspectives, methods for obtaining preferences of decision makers (e.g., patients), and ability to incorporate multiple dimensions of value; 3) discuss inclusions and exclusions of elements included in the framework, and whether the framework assumes clinical intervention or offers alternatives such as palliative care or watchful waiting; 4) evaluate data sources and their scientific validity; 5) assess the intervention's effect on total costs of treating a defined population; 6) analyze how uncertainty is incorporated; and 7) illuminate possible conflicts of interest among those creating the framework. We apply the taxonomy to four representative value frameworks recently published by professional organizations focused on treatment of cancer and heart disease and on vaccine use. We conclude that each of these efforts has strengths and weaknesses when evaluated using our taxonomy, and suggest pathways to enhance the utility of value-assessing frameworks for policy and clinical decision making.

The impact of telephonic wellness coaching on weight loss: A \"Natural Experiments for Translation in Diabetes (NEXT-D)\" study To evaluate the impact of a population-based telephonic wellness coaching program on weight loss. Individual-level segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series data comparing the BMI trajectories in the 12 months before versus the 12 months after initiating coaching among a cohort of Kaiser Permanente Northern California members (n = 954) participating in The Permanente Medical Group Wellness Coaching program in 2011. The control group was a 20:1 propensity-score matched control group (n = 19,080) matched with coaching participants based on baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. Wellness coaching participants had a significant upward trend in BMI in the 12 months before their first wellness coaching session and a significant downward trend in BMI in the 12 months after their first session equivalent to a clinically significant reduction of greater than one unit of baseline BMI (P < 0.01 for both). The control group did not have statistically significant decreases in BMI during the post-period. Wellness coaching has a positive impact on BMI reduction that is both statistically and clinically significant. Future research and quality improvement efforts should focus on disseminating wellness coaching for weight loss in patients with diabetes and those at risk for developing the disease. self-disclosure during contraceptive counseling Provider self-disclosure (PSD) - defined as providers making statements regarding personal information to patients - has not been well characterized in the context of contraceptive counseling. In this study, we describe the incidence, content and context of contraceptive PSD. This mixed methods analysis used data from the Provider-Patient Contraceptive Counseling study, for which 349 family planning patients were recruited from 2009 to 2012 from six clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area. Audio-recordings from their visits were analyzed for the presence or absence of PSD, and those visits with evidence of PSD were analyzed using qualitative methods. The associations of patient and provider demographics and patient satisfaction measures, obtained from survey data, with PSD were analyzed using bivariable and multivariable analyses. Thirty-seven percent of providers showed evidence of PSD during at least one visit, and PSD occurred in 9% of clinic visits. Fifty-four percent of PSD statements were about intrauterine devices. About half of PSD statements occurred prior to the final selection of the contraceptive method and appeared to influence the choice of method. In post-visit surveys, all patients who reported receiving PSD considered it to be appropriate, and patient-reported PSD was not statistically associated with measures of patient satisfaction. This study provides some support for the appropriateness of PSD during family planning encounters, at least as practiced during the sampled visits. Further research could explore whether this counseling strategy has an impact on patients' ability to identify the best contraceptive methods for them. In this study, PSD did not have a demonstrated negative effect on the provider-patient relationship. In almost half of visits, PSD appeared to influence patients' choice of a method; whether this influence is beneficial needs further research. data. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 isoform A (CPT1A) is a crucial enzyme for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria. The CPT1A p.P479L variant is found in high frequencies among indigenous populations residing on the west and north coasts of Alaska and Canada and in northeast Siberia and Greenland. Epidemiological studies have reported a statistical association between P479L homozygosity and infant death in Alaska Native and Canadian Inuit populations. Here, we review the available evidence about the P479L variant and apply to these data the epidemiological criteria for assessing causal associations. We found insufficient evidence to support a causal association with infant death and, further, that if a causal association is present, then the genotype is likely to be only one of a complex set of factors contributing to an increased risk of infant death. We conclude that additional research is needed to clarify the observed association and to inform effective preventative measures for infant death. In light of these findings, we discuss the policy implications for public health efforts because policies based on the observed association between P479L homozygosity and infant death data are premature.Genet Med advance online publication 26 January 2017. Authors: Identifies African-Specific Susceptibility Loci in African Americans With Inflammatory Bowel Disease The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) cause significant morbidity and are increasing in prevalence among all populations, including African Americans. More than 200 susceptibility loci have been identified in populations of predominantly European ancestry, but few loci have been associated with IBD in other ethnicities. We performed 2 high-density, genome-wide scans comprising 2345 cases of African Americans with IBD (1646 with CD, 583 with UC, and 116 inflammatory bowel disease unclassified) and 5002 individuals without IBD (controls, identified from the Health Retirement Study and Kaiser Permanente database). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at P < 5.0 \u00d7 10-8 in meta-analysis with a nominal evidence (P < .05) in each scan were considered to have genome-wide significance. We detected SNPs at HLA-DRB1, and African-specific SNPs at ZNF649 and LSAMP, with associations of genome-wide significance for UC. We detected SNPs at USP25 with associations of genome-wide significance for IBD. No associations of genome-wide significance were detected for CD. In addition, 9 genes previously associated with IBD contained SNPs with significant evidence for replication (P \u00d7 10-6): ADCY3, CXCR6, for CD; and KCNQ2 (near TNFRSF6B) for UC. Several of these genes, such as TNC (near TNFSF15), CXCR6, and genes associated with IBD at the HLA locus, contained SNPs with unique association patterns with African-specific alleles. We performed a genome-wide association study of African Americans with IBD and identified loci associated with UC in only this population; we also replicated IBD, CD, and UC loci identified in European populations. The detection of variants associated with IBD risk in only people of African descent demonstrates the importance of studying the genetics of IBD and other complex diseases in populations beyond those of European ancestry. Authors: Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection: A 12-Year Population-Based Study BACKGROUND Considerable efforts have been dedicated to developing strategies to prevent and treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI); however, evidence of the impact of rCDI on patient healthcare utilization and outcomes is limited. OBJECTIVE To compare healthcare utilization and 1-year mortality among adults who had rCDI, nonrecurrent CDI, or no CDI. METHODS We performed a nested case-control study among adult Kaiser Foundation Health Plan members from September 1, 2001, through December 31, 2013. We identified CDI through the presence of a positive laboratory test result and divided patients into 3 groups: patients with rCDI, defined as CDI in the 14-57 days after initial CDI; patients with nonrecurrent CDI; and patients who never had CDI. We conducted 3 matched comparisons: (1) rCDI vs (2) (3) nonrecurrent CDI vs no CDI. We followed patients for 1 year and compared healthcare utilization between groups, after matching patients on age, sex, and comorbidity. RESULTS We found that patients with rCDI consistently have substantially higher levels of healthcare utilization in various settings and greater 1-year mortality risk than both patients who had nonrecurrent CDI and patients who never had CDI. CONCLUSIONS Patients who develop an initial CDI are generally characterized by excess underlying, severe illness and utilization. However, patients with rCDI experience even greater adverse consequences of their disease than patients who do not experience rCDI. Our results further support the need for continued emphasis on identifying and using novel approaches to prevent and treat rCDI. Infect 2016-10-20. The Kaiser Permanente Northern California Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Program: Design, Development, and Implementation Complications are common after surgery, highlighting the need for innovations that reduce postsurgical morbidity and mortality. In this report, we describe the design, development, and implementation of an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated health care delivery system. This program was implemented and disseminated in 2014, targeting patients who underwent elective colorectal resection and those who underwent emergent hip fracture repair across 20 Medical Centers. The program leveraged multidisciplinary and broad-based leadership, high-quality data and analytic infrastructure, patient-centered education, and regional-local mentorship alignment. This program has already had an impact on more than 17,000 patients in Northern California. It is now in its fourth phase of planning and implementation, expanding Enhanced Recovery pathways to all surgical patients across Kaiser Permanente Northern California.

Influence of Language and Culture in the Primary Care of Spanish-Speaking Latino Adults with Poorly Controlled Diabetes: A Qualitative Study We examined the role of language and culture in the interactions between Spanish-speaking Latino patients with poorly controlled diabetes - a fast-growing population in the United States - and their primary care providers. We conducted four focus groups with 36 non-US born Spanish-speaking patients with elevated HbA1c. Participants were insured health plan members with either English-speaking (2 groups) or Spanish-speaking (2 groups) primary care providers. Moderated discussions focused on visit preparation, communication during visit, and role of other care team members. Key themes derived from these discussions were then linked to corresponding Latino cultural constructs. Patients had a mean age of 57.9 (\u00b111.2) years and last measured HbA1c was 8.6% (1.5%). Two communication-related themes (reluctance to switch providers and use of intermediaries) and two visit-related themes (provider-driven visit agendas and problem-based visits) emerged from our analyses. These themes reflected the cultural constructs of confianza (trust), familismo (family), respeto (deference), and simpat\u00eda (harmonious relationship). Trust in the patient-provider relationship led many participants to remain with English-speaking providers who treated them well. Patients with either language concordant and discordant providers reported reliance on family or other intermediaries to close communication gaps. Deference to physician expertise and authority led to visit expectations that it is the doctor's job to know what to ask and that visits were intended to address specific, often symptom-driven problems. Spanish-speaking Latino patients' cultural expectations play an important role in framing their primary care interactions. Recognizing culturally influenced visit expectations is an important step toward improving patient-provider communication. symptoms and adherence to cardiometabolic therapies across phases of treatment among adults with diabetes: the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) Among adults with diabetes, depression is associated with poorer adherence to cardiometabolic medications in ongoing users; however, it is unknown whether this extends to early adherence among patients newly prescribed these medications. This study examined whether depressive symptoms among adults with diabetes newly prescribed cardiometabolic medications are associated with early and long-term nonadherence. An observational follow-up of 4,018 adults with type 2 diabetes who completed a survey in 2006 and were newly prescribed oral antihyperglycemic, antihypertensive, or lipid-lowering agents within the following year at Kaiser Permanente Northern California was conducted. Depressive symptoms were examined based on Patient Health Questionnaire-8 scores. Pharmacy utilization data were used to identify nonadherence by using validated methods: early nonadherence (medication never dispensed or dispensed once and never refilled) and long-term nonadherence (new prescription medication gap [NPMG]: percentage of time without medication supply). These analyses were conducted in 2016. Patients with moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms had poorer adherence than nondepressed patients (8.3% more patients with early nonadherence, P=0.01; 4.9% patients with NPMG, nonadherence [medication gap >20%], P=0.03). After adjustment for confounders, the models remained statistically significant for new NPMG (3.7% difference, P=0.02). There was a graded association between greater depression severity and nonadherence for all the models (test of trend, P<0.05). Depressive symptoms were associated with modest differences in early and long-term adherence to newly prescribed cardiometabolic medications in diabetes patients. Interventions targeting adherence among adults with diabetes and depression need to address both initiation and maintenance of medication use. Authors: Bauer AM; The Next Frontier in Communication and the ECLIPPSE Study: Bridging the Linguistic Divide in Secure Messaging Health systems are heavily promoting patient portals. However, limited health literacy (HL) can restrict online communication via secure messaging (SM) because patients' literacy skills must be sufficient to convey and comprehend content while clinicians must encourage and elicit communication from patients and match patients' literacy level. This paper describes the Employing Computational Linguistics to Improve Patient-Provider Secure Email (ECLIPPSE) study, an interdisciplinary effort bringing together scientists in communication, computational linguistics, and health services to employ computational linguistic methods to (1) create a novel Linguistic Complexity Profile (LCP) to characterize communications of patients and clinicians and demonstrate its validity and (2) examine whether providers accommodate communication needs of patients with limited HL by tailoring their SM responses. We will study >5 million SMs generated by >150,000 ethnically diverse type 2 diabetes patients and >9000 clinicians from two settings: an integrated delivery system and a public (safety net) system. Finally, we will then create an LCP-based automated aid that delivers real-time feedback to clinicians to reduce the linguistic complexity of their SMs. This research will support health systems' journeys to become health literate healthcare organizations and reduce HL-related disparities in diabetes care.

Missing laboratory results data in electronic health databases: implications for monitoring diabetes risk Laboratory test (lab) results may be useful to detect incident diabetes in electronic health record and claims-based studies. Using the Mini-Sentinel distributed database, we assessed the value of lab results added to diagnosis codes and dispensing claims to identify incident diabetes. Inclusion of lab results increased the number of diabetes outcomes identified by 21%. In settings where capture of lab results was relatively complete, the absence of lab results was associated with implausibly low rates of the outcome. Lab results can increase sensitivity of algorithms for detecting diabetes, and missing lab results are associated with much lower rates of diabetes ascertainment regardless of algorithm. Patterns of missing lab results may Epub 2016-12-09. Nearly One-Third Of Enrollees In California's Individual Market Missed Opportunities To Receive Financial Assistance The Affordable Care Act includes financial assistance that reduces both premiums and cost-sharing amounts for lower-income Americans, to increase the affordability of health insurance coverage and care. To receive both types of assistance, enrollees must purchase a qualified health plan through a public insurance exchange, and those eligible for the cost-sharing reduction must purchase a silver-tier plan. We estimate that 31 percent of individual-market enrollees in California who were likely eligible for financial assistance purchased plans that were not silver tier or that were not sold on the state's exchange and thus missed opportunities to receive premium or cost-sharing assistance or both. Lower-income enrollees who chose plans not eligible for subsidies had two to three times higher odds of reporting difficulty paying premiums and out-of-pocket expenses during the year, compared to those who chose eligible plans. Regardless of how the structure of the individual market evolves in the coming years, efforts are likely needed to steer lower-income enrollees away from financially suboptimal plan Jan 01;36(1):21-31. Patterns and predictors of severe postpartum anemia after Cesarean section Postpartum anemia is associated with maternal and perinatal morbidity. Population-level data may inform guideline development for postpartum anemia screening. Our objectives were to evaluate the associations between potential predictors (predelivery anemia and postpartum hemorrhage [PPH]) with severe postpartum anemia after Cesarean section. Data were collected from 70,939 hospitalizations for Cesarean section performed at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities between 2005 and 2013. Severe postpartum anemia was defined as a hemoglobin (Hb) level of less than 8 g/dL before hospital discharge. Using multivariable logistic regression, we assessed the associations between predelivery anemia and PPH with severe postpartum anemia. Distributions of these characteristics among women with severe postpartum anemia were evaluated. The overall rate of severe postpartum anemia was 7.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.1%-7.4%). Severe postpartum anemia was strongly associated with a predelivery Hb level between 10 and 10.9 g/dL [aOR], 5.4; 95% CI, The proportions of women with severe postpartum anemia were highest for those experiencing PPH but no predelivery anemia (12.2%; 95% CI, 11.0%-13.6%) and those who did incur PPH nor predelivery anemia (10.7%; 95% CI, 9.6%-12.0%). Our findings suggest that PPH and predelivery anemia are strong independent risk factors for severe postpartum anemia. Optimization of patients' Hb before delivery may reduce the incidence of severe anemia after Cesarean section. Authors: Butwick AJ; 2016-09-13. Changes in Medication Use After Dementia Diagnosis in an Observational Cohort of Individuals with Diabetes Mellitus To assess changes in medication use after a diagnosis of dementia in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Difference-in-differences analysis of changes in the number of dispensed chronic medications between individuals with and without newly diagnosed dementia. Integrated healthcare delivery system, Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Individuals aged 50 and older without prevalent dementia with type 2 diabetes mellitus enrolled in a baseline survey. During 5 years of follow-up, 193 individuals with a new diagnosis of dementia were identified, and risk-set sampling was used to randomly select five reference subjects per case matched on 5-year age categories and sex (965 matched participants), resulting in an analytical sample of 1,158. The exposure was new diagnosis of dementia. The primary outcome was change in number of current chronic medications (total, cardiovascular (blood pressure and lipid control), diabetes mellitus) at three times: 1 year before index date (preindex date), date of diagnosis of dementia or matched reference date (index date), and up to 1 year after index date or end of follow-up if censored before 1 year (postindex date). After adjustment, the number of chronic medications and the subset of cardiovascular medications declined after a dementia diagnosis in the overall cohort and in age-, sex-, and time-matched reference individuals, but the decline was significantly greater in the group with dementia (0.71 medications fewer than the reference group, P = .02). The number of diabetes mellitus medications declined in both groups, but the declines were not statistically different (0.18 medications fewer than the reference group, P = .008). Use of cardiometabolic medications fell after a diagnosis of dementia, as recommended in national guidelines. outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus: The Diabetes & Aging Study To classify trajectories of long term HbA1c values in patients after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and examine each trajectory's associations with subsequent microvascular and macrovascular events and mortality. A longitudinal follow-up of 28,016 patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes was conducted. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify ten-year HbA1c trajectories. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess how HbA1c trajectories were associated with events (microvascular and macrovascular) After adjusting for average HbA1c, compared to the low stable trajectory, all non-stable trajectories were associated with higher incidences of microvascular events (hazard ratio (HR) range, 1.28 (95% CI, 1.08-1.53) (high decreasing early) to 1.45 (95% CI, 1.20-1.75) (moderate peaking early)). The high decreasing early trajectory was associated with an increased mortality risk (HR, 1.27 (95% CI, 1.03-1.58)). Trajectories were not associated with macrovascular events. Non-stable HbA1c trajectories were associated with greater risk of microvascular events and mortality. These findings suggest a potential benefit of early diabetes detection, prioritizing good glycemic control, and maintaining control over Complicat. 2017 Jan;31(1):94-100. Epub 2016-07-26. Altered resting state functional connectivity of fear and reward circuitry in comorbid PTSD and major depression. BACKGROUND: Individuals with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder (PTSD-MDD) often exhibit greater functional impairment and poorer treatment response than individuals with PTSD alone. Research has not determined whether PTSD-MDD is associated with different network connectivity abnormalities than PTSD alone. METHODS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) patterns of brain regions involved in fear and reward processing in three groups: patients with PTSD-alone (n = 27), PTSD-MDD (n = 21), and trauma-exposed healthy controls (TEHCs, n = 34). Based on previous research, seeds included basolateral amygdala (BLA), centromedial amygdala of of BLA-orbitalfrontal cortex (OFC) and CMA-thalamus pathways, key to fear processing, and fear expression, respectively. PTSD-MDD, compared to PTSD-alone and TEHC, was associated with decreased connectivity across multiple amygdala and striatal-subcortical pathways: BLA-OFC, NAcc-thalamus, and pathways were correlated Comorbid PTSD-MDD may be associated with multifaceted functional connectivity alterations in both fear and reward systems. Clinical implications are discussed. 2016 Dec 28. A cross species study of heterogeneity in fear extinction learning in relation to FKBP5 variation and expression: Implications for the acute treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder. Deficits in fear extinction learning are hypothesized to underlie the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Such deficits may, in part, be due to genetic and epigenetic variation in the stress related gene FKBP5. Conversely, altering FKBP5 epigenetic responses during memory consolidation may rescue extinction deficits making it a target for acute intervention to prevent the development of PTSD. Study 1 (Humans) examines if FKBP5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and PTSD symptom domains (re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, hyperarousal) are associated with abnormal fear extinction phenotypes identified using latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM). Study 2 (Mice) tests if increasing doses of dexamethasone administered prior to extinction alters Fkbp5 mRNA production in the amygdala after extinction and recall and prevents the development of abnormal extinction phenotypes. In humans, abnormal extinction was associated with the TT homozygous genotype of FKBP5 SNPs RS9470080 mug/kg was associated with increased amygdala Fkbp5 mRNA following extinction and robust extinction learning while lower doses were not associated with amygdala Fkbp5 mRNA or differences in extinction learning. Further, mice that extinguished on dexamethasone 300 mug/kg maintained low levels of freezing behavior during recall training while mRNA levels were no longer elevated. Together, findings indicate that FKBP5 confers risk for fear extinction deficits. However, this risk may be ameliorated by increasing fkbp5 mRNA expression in the amygdala during memory consolidation making this mechanism a plausible point of acute intervention to prevent the development 23.

Association of Acculturation and Health Literacy with Prevalent Dysglycemia and Diabetes Control Among Latinos in the Boston Area Community Health (BACH) Survey This study assessed the effect of acculturation on type 2 diabetes and whether health literacy may mediate this association. The Boston Area Community Health cohort is a multi-stage stratified random sample of adults from Boston including 744 Latinos. We defined dysglycemia as a HbA1c 5.7 %. Multivariable analyses examined the associations between acculturation and health literacy adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. Similar analyses were performed among participants with HbA1c 7.0 % to assess the association between acculturation and diabetes control. Among an insured primarily foreign born Spanish speaking Latino population, with a long residence period in the US and good healthcare utilization, higher levels of acculturation were not associated with dysglycemia. Lower levels of acculturation were associated with worse diabetes control. Health literacy level did not modify these associations. Elucidating the components of heterogeneity among Latinos will be essential for understanding the influence of acculturation Dec;18(6):1266-1273. Randomised controlled trial of alternative messages to increase enrolment in a healthy food programme among individuals with diabetes We compared the effectiveness of diabetes-focused messaging strategies at increasing enrolment in a healthy food programme among adults with diabetes. Vitality is a multifaceted wellness benefit available to members of Discovery Health, a South Africa-based health insurer. One of the largest Vitality programmes is HealthyFood (HF), an incentive-based programme designed to encourage healthier diets by providing up to 25% cashback on healthy food purchases. We randomised adults with type 2 diabetes to 1 of 5 arms: (1) control, (2) a diabetes-specific message, (3) a message with a recommendation of HF written from the perspective of a HF member with diabetes, (4) a message containing a physician's recommendation of HF, or (5) the diabetes-specific message from arm 2 paired with an 'enhanced active choice'(EAC). In an EAC, readers are asked to make an immediate choice (in this case, to enrol or not enrol); the pros and cons associated with the preferred and non-preferred options are highlighted. HF enrolment was assessed 1 month following the first emailed message. We randomised 3906 members. After excluding those who enrolled in HF or departed from the Vitality programme before the first intervention email, 3665 (94%) were included in a modified intent-to-treat analysis. All 4 experimental arms had significantly higher HF enrolment rates compared with control (p<0.0001 for all comparisons). When comparing experimental arms, the diabetes-specific message with the EAC had a significantly higher enrolment rate (12.6%) than the diabetes-specific message alone (7.6%, p=0.0016). Messages focused on diabetes were effective at increasing enrolment in a healthy food programme. The addition of a framed active choice to a message significantly raised enrolment rates in this population. These findings suggest that simple, low-cost interventions can enhance enrolment in health promoting programmes and also be pragmatically tested within those programmes. Prospective Case-Control Study of Abnormal Bleeding after Outpatient Corticosteroid Injection This study is aimed at evaluating the incidence of bleeding among women having outpatient corticosteroid injection compared to matched controls, using mailed surveys and electronic health records. Prospective survey study of women receiving outpatient corticosteroid injection for joint or back pain (cases) compared to women matched for visit, diagnosis of joint/back pain, and age, who did not receive an injection (controls). A survey was mailed 45 days following outpatient visit, inquiring about menstrual history, abnormal bleeding, and potential risk factors. The proportion of women reporting abnormal bleeding was compared between cases and controls, and stratified by menopausal status. One thousand and sixty two surveys were mailed to 531 identified cases/control pairs, and 40% response was seen from each group. Of 379 analyzable responders, 135 (36%) were premenopausal and 244 (64%) postmenopausal. Postmenopausal women who had a corticosteroid injection were more likely to report recent abnormal bleeding compared to controls (17 vs. 7%, p = 0.02), whereas rates were similar among premenopausal women (50 vs. 43%, p = 0.39). When logistic regression was performed, injection was associated with bleeding among postmenopausal women, independent of body mass index and hormone use. Corticosteroid injection is associated with increased abnormal vaginal bleeding among postmenopausal women. Authors: Suh-Burgmann E; Liu JY Gynecol Obstet Invest. 2016 Nov 23. Chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired fear extinction in humans. The use of fear conditioning and extinction paradigms to examine intermediate phenotypes of anxiety and stress-related disorders has facilitated the identification of neurobiological mechanisms that underlie specific components of abnormal psychological functioning. Across species, acute pharmacologic manipulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system has provided evidence of its critical role in fear extinction, but the effects of chronic cannabis on extinction are relatively understudied. In rats, chronic cannabinoid administration impairs fear extinction in a drug-free state. Here we examine whether chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired fear extinction in humans. Participants were healthy chronic cannabis users (n = 20) and nonuser controls with minimal lifetime cannabis use (n = 20) matched on age, sex, and race who all screened negative for psychiatric disorders. A 2-day differential fear conditioning paradigm was used to test the hypothesis that chronic cannabis use would be associated with impaired extinction of the skin conductance response. Consistent with hypotheses, chronic cannabis use was associated with reduced within-session extinction of skin conductance response on Day 1 (d = 0.78), and between-session extinction on Day 2 (d = 0.76). Unexpectedly, cannabis use was also associated with reduced subjective differentiation between threat and safety stimuli during conditioning. Replication and translation of findings are necessary to test potential mechanisms directly and examine whether impairments can be reversed pharmacologically or after a period of 2016 Nov 3. Incorporating an Early Detection System Into Routine Clinical Practice in Two Community Hospitals Efforts to improve outcomes of patients who deteriorate outside the intensive care unit have included the use of rapid response teams (RRTs) as well as manual and automated prognostic scores. Although automated early warning systems (EWSs) are starting to enter clinical practice, there are few reports describing implementation and the processes required to integrate early warning approaches into hospitalists' workflows. We describe the implementation process at 2 community hospitals that deployed an EWS. We employed the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act approach. Our basic workflow, which relies on having an RRT nurse and the EWS's 12-hour outcome time frame, has been accepted by clinicians and has not been associated with patient complaints. Whereas our main objective was to develop a set of workflows for integrating the electronic medical record EWS into clinical practice, we also uncovered issues that must be addressed prior to disseminating this intervention to other hospitals. One problematic area is that of documentation following an alert. Other areas that must be addressed prior to disseminating the intervention include the need for educating clinicians on the rationale for deploying the EWS, careful consideration of interdepartment service agreements, clear definition of clinician responsibilities, pragmatic documentation standards, and how to communicate with patients. In addition to the deployment of the EWS to other hospitals, a future direction for our teams will be to characterize process-outcomes relationships in the clinical response itself.

Implementation of a multicenter performance improvement program for early detection and treatment of severe sepsis in general medical-surgical wards Sepsis is a leading cause of in-hospital death, and evidence suggests a higher mortality in patients presenting with sepsis on the ward compared to those presenting to the emergency department. Ward patients who develop severe sepsis may have poor outcomes for a variety of reasons, including delayed diagnosis, lack of readily available staffing, and delayed treatment. We report on a multihospital quality improvement program for early detection and treatment of sepsis on general medical-surgical wards. We describe a multipronged approach to improve severe sepsis outcomes using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Plan-Do-Study-Act model. Sixty sites engaged in a collaborative implementation process that aligned people, process, and technology. Based on our experience, we recommend a stepwise approach to implement such a program: (1) both administrative and clinical leadership commit to a common goal; (2) appoint clinical champions and give them authority to engage other clinicians to improve timeliness of interventions; (3) map workflows and processes to rely heavily on the nursing staff's ability to evaluate and report severe sepsis screening results; (4) if available, design and deploy technology with the assistance of clinical informaticians (eg, to enable electronic health records-based continuous screening); (5) to determine success, consider tracking screening compliance and process, and outcome measures such as length of stay and mortality.

Piloting electronic medical record-based early detection of inpatient deterioration in community hospitals Patients who deteriorate in the hospital outside the intensive care unit (ICU) have higher mortality and morbidity than those admitted directly to the ICU. As more hospitals deploy comprehensive inpatient electronic medical records (EMRs), attempts to support rapid response teams with automated early detection systems are becoming more frequent. We aimed to describe some of the technical and operational challenges involved in the deployment of an early detection system. This 2-hospital pilot, set within an integrated healthcare delivery system with 21 hospitals, had 2 objectives. First, it aimed to demonstrate that severity scores and probability estimates could be provided to hospitalists in real time. Second, it aimed to surface issues that would need to be addressed so that deployment of the early warning system could occur in all remaining hospitals. To achieve these objectives, we first established a rationale for the development of an early detection system through the analysis of risk-adjusted outcomes. We then demonstrated that EMR data could be employed to predict deteriorations. After addressing specific organizational mandates (eg, defining the clinical response to a probability estimate), we instantiated a set of equations into a Java application that transmits scores and probability estimates so that they are visible in a commercially available EMR every 6 hours. The pilot has been successful and deployment to the remaining hospitals has begun. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2016;11:S18-S24. \u00a9 2016 Society of Hospital Medicine. Nov;11 Suppl 1:S18-S24. Early detection, prevention, and mitigation of critical illness outside intensive care settings Patients who deteriorate outside the intensive care unit (ICU) are known to have elevated mortality and morbidity. Rapid response teams (RRTs) were developed to address such deterioration. It has not been possible to establish that RRTs employing manual detection methods have definitively improved hospital outcomes. Because of this, automated early detection systems based on data from modern electronic medical records have been developed. This article attempts to establish a conceptual framework for early detection, prevention, and mitigation of critical illness in hospitalized patients outside the ICU. Taking a step back from the now voluminous clinical and statistical literature on early warning systems, this article focuses on definitional issues (What is early detection? What does it aim to detect, and how?). Particular attention is given to how early detection systems interface with patients who are near the end of life. Also addressed are problems of how one quantifies benefit, which includes consideration of downsides such as potential harms of early detection.

Data that drive: Closing the loop in the learning hospital system The learning healthcare system describes a vision of US healthcare that capitalizes on science, information technology, incentives, and care culture to drive improvements in the quality of health care. The inpatient setting, one of the most costly and impactful domains of healthcare, is an ideal setting in which to use data and information technology to foster continuous learning and quality improvement. The rapid digitization of inpatient medicine offers incredible new opportunities to use data from routine care to generate new discovery and thus close the virtuous cycle of learning. We use an object lesson-sepsis care within the 21 hospitals of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated healthcare delivery system-to offer insight into the critical elements necessary for developing a learning hospital system. We then describe how a hospital-wide data-driven approach to inpatient care can facilitate improvements in the quality of hospital care.

Early detection of critical illness outside the intensive care unit: Clarifying treatment plans and honoring goals of care using a supportive care team Given the high mortality experienced by patients who deteriorate outside the intensive care unit, issues related to patient preferences around escalation of care are common. However, the literature on early warning systems (EWSs) provides limited information on how respecting patient preferences can be incorporated into clinical workflows. In this report, we describe how we developed workflows for integrating supportive care with an automated EWS in the context of a 2-hospital pilot. We used the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Plan-Do-Study-Act approach to achieve consensus with clinicians and administrators. The workflows will serve as the basis for dissemination to an additional 19 hospitals. We were successful in integrating an automated EWS with supportive care. Our workflows take local resource availability into account and have been well received by hospitalists, nurses, and families. Our work demonstrates that one can achieve integration of proactive supportive care into the operation of an EWS. Creation of a palliative care response arm that is complementary to a clinical rescue arm ensures that patient preferences are respected.

Self-reported depression and perceived financial burden among long-term rectal cancer survivors Types of surgery for rectal cancer (RC), including permanent ostomy (PO) or temporary ostomy followed by anastomosis (TO) or initial anastomosis (AN), can affect psychological and financial well-being during active treatment. However, these relationships have not been well studied among long-term survivors (5 years post-diagnosis). A mailed survey with 576 long-term RC survivors who were members of Kaiser Permanente was conducted in 2010-2011. Prevalence of current depression was ascertained using a score of 45.6 on the Short Form-12 version 2 mental component summary. Perceived financial burden was assessed using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (severe). Regression analyses were used to measure associations after adjustment for covariates. The overall prevalence of depression was 24% among RC survivors with the highest prevalence among those with a history of PO (31%). The adjusted odds of depression among TO and AN survivors were lower than that among PO survivors, 0.42 (CI95% 0.20-0.89) and 0.59 (CI95% 0.37-0.93), respectively. Twenty-two percent perceived moderate-to-high current financial burden (4 points). PO survivors also reported higher mean financial burden than AN survivors (2.6 vs. 1.6, respectively; p = 0.002), but perceived burden comparably to TO survivors (2.3). Self-reported depression was associated with higher perceived financial burden (p < 0.001); surgical procedure history did not modify this relationship. Depression was reported frequently among these long-term RC survivors, particularly among PO survivors. Depression was associated with greater perception of financial burden. Screening for depression and assessing financial well-being might improve care among long-term RC survivors.Copyright \u00a9 Spanish Language Competent Physicians: The Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) Language barriers negatively impact health care access and quality for US immigrants. Latinos are the second largest immigrant group and the largest, fastest growing minority. Health care systems need simple, low cost and accurate tools that they can use to identify physicians with Spanish language competence. We sought to address this need by validating a simple and low-cost tool already in use in a major health plan. A web-based survey conducted in 2012 among physicians caring for patients in a large, integrated health care delivery system. Of the 2,198 survey respondents, 111 were used in additional analysis involving patient report of those physicians' fluency. We compared health care physicians' responses to a single item, Spanish language self-assessment tool (measuring \"medical proficiency\") with patient-reported physician language competence, and two validated physician self-assessment tools (measuring \"fluency\" and \"confidence\"). Concordance between medical proficiency was moderate with patient reports (weighted Kappa .45), substantial with fluency (weighted Kappa .76), and moderate-to-substantial with confidence (weighted Kappas .53 to .66). The single-question self-reported medical proficiency tool is a low-cost tool useful for quickly identifying Spanish competent physicians and is potentially suitable for use in clinical settings. A reasonable approach for health systems is to designate only those physicians who self-assess their Spanish medical proficiency as \"high\" as competent to provide care without an Epub 2016-Oct-20. Neural changes in extinction recall following prolonged exposure treatment for PTSD: A longitudinal fMRI study. BACKGROUND: Neurobiological models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) implicate fear processing impairments in the maintenance of the disorder. Specific deficits in extinction recall, the retention of learned extinction, have been demonstrated. While deficient extinction recall, and the associated activation pattern of prefrontal and hippocampal regions, distinguishes individuals with PTSD from controls, research has not yet examined changes following treatment. We examined the behavioral and neural correlates of extinction recall before and after cognitive behavioral treatment of PTSD. METHODS: Fifty-eight participants (30 with PTSD, 28 trauma-exposed matched controls) underwent a 2-day behavioral fear conditioning, extinction, and recall paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The same procedures were repeated 10 weeks later, after PTSD patients had completed prolonged exposure treatment. We analyzed fMRI data from 32 subjects (16 PTSD; 16 controls) and skin conductance response (SCR) data from 33 subjects (16 PTSD; 17 controls). Neural activity during extinction recall, SCR, and PTSD symptoms were compared across groups and over time. RESULTS: PTSD patients exhibited pre- to post-treatment reduction in rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) activation during extinction recall, and increase in functional coherence between the rACC and the symptom severity from pre- to post-treatment was significantly associated with reduced subgenual ACC and parahippocampal activation during this task. SCR during the extinction recall phase did not significantly change with treatment in the PTSD group, but change in SCR was associated with reduction in PTSD symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged exposure treatment appears to alter neural activation in PTSD patients during recall of fear extinction, and change in extinction recall (measured by SCR) is associated with symptom reduction. We discuss results in the context of neural systems involved in response to affective 2016. Dietary quality and household food insecurity among Mexican children and adolescents. Seventy percent of Mexican households experience some level of food insecurity (FI). Studies have shown positive associations between FI and poor dietary quality. As far as it is known, this is the first time the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) has been used to assess dietary quality of children and adolescents in Mexico, and to examine if FI is related to it. The objective of this research is to assess dietary quality and its association with FI among Mexican children and adolescents from a nationally representative cross-sectional sample. We analyzed data from 4635 2-19-year-old Mexican children and adolescents participating in the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey (Ensanut 2012). FI was measured using the Latin American and Caribbean Household Food Security Scale (ELCSA) and dietary quality with the HEI-2010. We examined the association between FI and dietary quality using multivariate linear regressions. Dietary quality was worst as FI became more severe among children and adolescents compared with their counterparts living in households with food security. Specifically, FI had a negative association with fruits, vegetables, and protein foods, and a positive association with refined grains consumption. Dairy intake was negatively associated with FI among older children and adolescents. Added sugars were not associated with FI, but intake was excessive across the population at 15% of total daily energy intake. Decreasing FI may help improve dietary quality of Mexican children and adolescents. Nov 14. Police-Recorded Crime and Perceived Stress among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) While stress has been linked to poor health outcomes, little is known about the impact of objective measures of neighborhood crime on stress in patients with chronic disease. Using the Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE), we examined associations between police-recorded crime (2005-2007) and stress (Perceived Stress Scale-4) in four large Northern California cities (Oakland, Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Jose). We performed stratified analysis by gender and race/ethnicity using generalized linear regression models. In our study sample (n = 3188, mean age 59, range 30-77), 10 % reported high stress. In adjusted analyses, higher neighborhood all crimes rate was associated with modest increase in high stress for African-American (OR = 1.10; 95 % CI 1.02-1.22) and Latina women (OR = 1.36; 95 % CI 1.10-1.67) and property crime showed similar associations with stress for these groups of women. Visible crime was associated with stress only for Latina women (OR = 1.43; 95 % CI 1.14-1.78). We found no association between crime and stress among men or other racial/ethnic groups of women. High crime levels may disproportionately impact health among certain subpopulations. Studies using additional measures of stress are necessary to differentiate the health impact of crime-related stress from other forms of stressors among individuals living with diabetes.

Clinical Characteristics Associated with the Use of a Decision Tool for Disposition of ED Patients with Pulmonary Embolism Adoption of clinical decision support (CDS) tools by clinicians is often limited by workflow barriers. We sought to assess characteristics associated with clinician use of an electronic health record-embedded clinical decision support system (CDSS). In a prospective study on emergency department (ED) activation of a CDSS tool across 14 hospitals between 9/1/14 to 4/30/15, the CDSS was deployed at 10 active sites with an on-site champion, education sessions, iterative feedback, and up to 3 gift cards/clinician as an incentive. The tool was also deployed at 4 passive sites that received only an introductory educational session. Activation of the CDSS - which calculated the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) score and provided guidance - and associated clinical data were collected prospectively. We used multivariable logistic regression with random effects at provider/facility levels to assess the association between activation of the CDSS tool and characteristics at: 1) patient level (PESI score), 2) provider level (demographics and clinical load at time of activation opportunity), and 3) facility level (active vs. passive site, facility ED volume, and ED acuity at time of activation opportunity). Out of 662 eligible patient encounters, the CDSS was activated in 55%: sites: 68% (346/512); passive sites 13% (20/150). In bivariate analysis, active sites had an increase in activation rates based on the number of prior gift cards the physician had received (96% if 3 prior cards versus 60% if 0, p<0.0001). At passive sites, physicians < age 40 had higher rates of activation (p=0.03). In multivariable analysis, active site status, low ED volume at the time of diagnosis and PESI scores I or II (compared to III or higher) were associated with higher likelihood of CDSS activation. Performing on-site tool promotion significantly increased odds of CDSS activation. Optimizing CDSS adoption requires active education. Sep 21;7(3):883-98. Epub 2016-09-21. Development and Validation of an Electronic Medical Record-Based Alert Score for Detection of Inpatient Deterioration Outside the ICU Patients in general medical-surgical wards who experience unplanned transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) show evidence of physiologic derangement 6 to 24 hours prior to their deterioration. With increasing availability of electronic medical records (EMRs), automated early warning scores (EWSs) are becoming feasible. To describe the development and performance of an automated EWS based on EMR data. We used a discrete-time logistic regression model to obtain an hourly risk score to predict unplanned transfer to the ICU within the next 12 hours. The model was based on hospitalization episodes from all adult patients (18 years) admitted to 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) hospitals from 1/1/2010 to 12/31/2013. Eligible patients met these entry criteria: initial hospitalization occurred at a KPNC hospital; the hospitalization was not for childbirth; and the EMR had been operational at the hospital for at least 3 months. We evaluated the performance of this risk score, called Advanced Alert Monitor (AAM) and compared it against two other EWSs (eCART and NEWS) in terms of their sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (c statistic). A total of 649,418 hospitalization episodes involving 374,838 patients met inclusion criteria, with 19,153 of the episodes experiencing at least one outcome. The analysis data set had 48,723,248 hourly observations. Predictors included physiologic data (laboratory tests and vital signs); neurological status; severity of illness and longitudinal comorbidity indices; care directives; and health services indicators (e.g. elapsed length of stay). AAM showed better performance compared to NEWS and eCART in all the metrics and prediction intervals. The AAM AUC was 0.82 compared to 0.79 and 0.76 for eCART and NEWS, respectively. Using a threshold that generated 1 alert per day in a unit with a patient census of 35, the sensitivity of AAM was 49% (95% CI: 47.6-50.3%) compared to the sensitivities of scores of 44% (42.3 -45.1) and 40% (38.2-40.9), respectively. For all three scores, about half of alerts occurred within 12 hours of the event, and almost two thirds within 24 hours of the event CONCLUSION: The AAM score is an example of a score that takes advantage of multiple data streams now available in modern EMRs. It highlights the ability to harness complex algorithms to maximize signal extraction. The main challenge in the future is to develop detection approaches for patients in whom data are sparser because their baseline risk is lower. Authors: Inform. 2016 Sep 19. Conversations for Providers Caring for Patients With Rectal Cancer: Comparison of Long-Term Patient-Centered Outcomes for Patients With Low Rectal Cancer Facing Ostomy or Sphincter-Sparing Surgery For some patients with low rectal cancer, ostomy (with elimination into a pouch) may be the only realistic surgical option. However, some patients have a choice between ostomy and sphincter-sparing surgery. Sphincter-sparing surgery has been preferred over ostomy because it offers preservation of normal bowel function. However, this surgery can cause incontinence and bowel dysfunction. Increasingly, it has become evident that certain patients who are eligible for sphincter-sparing surgery may not be well served by the surgery, and construction of an ostomy may be better. No validated assessment tool or decision aid has been published to help newly diagnosed patients decide between the two surgeries or to help physicians elicit long-term surgical outcomes. Furthermore, comparison of long-term outcomes and late effects after the two surgeries has not been synthesized. Therefore, this systematic review summarizes controlled studies that compared long-term survivorship outcomes between these two surgical groups. The goals are: 1) to improve understanding and shared decision-making among surgeons, oncologists, primary care providers, patients, and caregivers; 2) to increase the patient's participation in the decision; 3) to alert the primary care provider to patient challenges that could be addressed by provider attention and intervention; and 4) ultimately, to improve patients' long-term quality of life. This report includes discussion points for health care providers to use with their patients during initial discussions of ostomy and sphincter-sparing surgery as well as questions to ask during follow-up examinations to ascertain any long-term challenges facing the patient.

A Learning Behavioral Health Care System: Opportunities to Enhance Research Sweeping changes in health care financing combined with the increased use of technology across health care systems are making it possible to address long-standing challenges to the behavioral health services delivery system. This Open Forum outlines opportunities and challenges facing health services researchers in this rapidly changing landscape. Inspired by a 2012 report by the Institute of Medicine, the authors discuss innovative research endeavors, promising study designs, and challenges involved in integrating high-impact behavioral health services research within a learning behavioral health care framework. The Open Forum concludes with a discussion of the critical next steps in this process: building consensus around common metrics for high-quality care, relevant outcomes, and contextual factors; connecting researchers to community and clinical settings; creating a data commons to pool information across sites; and designing and evaluating evidence-based decision support tools to drive improved care and outcomes.

Risk of Serious Infection for Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Starting Glucocorticoids with or without Antimalarials To compare serious infection risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients starting glucocorticoids (GC), antimalarials (AM), or their combination. We conducted a new-user, historical cohort study, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, 1997-2013. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to calculate adjusted HR and 95% CI. The study included 3030 patients with SLE followed an average of 4 years. Compared with patients starting AM without GC (9 infections/1461 patient-yrs), the HR for the risk of infection was 3.9 (95% CI 1.7-9.2) for those starting GC 15 mg/day without AM (14 infections/252 patient-yrs), while it was 0.0 (0 infections/128 patient-yrs) for those starting the combination. We split the 14 patients with a serious infection and with GC < 15 mg/day into 2 groups: < 7.5 and 7.5-15 mg/day. The HR for < 7.5 mg/day was 4.6 (95% CI 1.8-11.4) and for 7.5-15 mg/day, 3.1 (95% CI 1.0-9.7). For patients starting GC > 15 mg/day (reflecting more severe SLE), the risk of infection was nearly the same for the combination of GC and AM (9 infections/135 patient-yrs) and GC alone (41 infections/460 patient-yrs), but the combination users had evidence of more severe disease. Patients with SLE had a 6- to 7-fold greater risk of serious infection than the general population. Our findings suggest that the benefits of AM treatment for SLE may extend to preventing serious infections. Although the study included > 3000 patients, the statistical power to examine GC dosages < 15 mg/day was The Digital Divide and Patient Portals: Internet Access Explained Differences in Patient Portal Use for Secure Messaging by Age, Race, and Income Online access to health records and the ability to exchange secure messages with physicians can improve patient engagement and outcomes; however, the digital divide could limit access to web-based portals among disadvantaged groups. To understand whether sociodemographic differences in patient portal use for secure messaging can be explained by differences in internet access and care preferences. Cross-sectional survey to examine the association between patient sociodemographic characteristics and internet access and care preferences; then, the association between sociodemographic characteristics and secure message use with and without adjusting for internet access and care preference. One thousand forty-one patients with chronic conditions in a large integrated health care delivery system (76% response rate). Internet access, portal use for secure messaging, preference for in-person or online care, and sociodemographic and health characteristics. Internet access and preference mediated some of the differences in secure message use by age, race, and income. For example, using own computer to access the internet explained 52% of the association between race and secure message use and 60% of the association between income and use (Sobel-Goodman mediation test, P<0.001 for both). Education and sex-related differences in portal use remained statistically significant when controlling for internet access and preference. As the availability and use of patient portals increase, it is important to understand which patients have limited access and the barriers they may face. Improving internet access and making portals available across multiple platforms, including mobile, may reduce some disparities in secure message use.

In-hospital mortality following treatment with red blood cell transfusion or inotropic therapy during early goal-directed therapy for septic shock: a retrospective propensity-adjusted analysis We sought to investigate whether treatment of subnormal (<70%) central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) with inotropes or red blood cell (RBC) transfusion during early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) for septic shock is independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Retrospective analysis of a prospective EGDT patient database drawn from 21 emergency departments with a single standardized EGDT protocol. Patients were included if, during EGDT, they concomitantly achieved a central venous pressure (CVP) of ?8 mm Hg and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ?65 mm Hg while registering a ScvO2?70%. Treatment propensity scores for either RBC transfusion or inotrope administration were separately determined from independent patient sub-cohorts. Propensity-adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted to test for associations between treatments and in-hospital mortality. Of 2,595 EGDT patients, 572 (22.0%) met study inclusion criteria. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 20.5%. Inotropes or RBC transfusions were administered for an ScvO2?70% to 51.9% of patients. Patients were not statistically more likely to achieve an ScvO2 of ?70% if they were treated with RBC transfusion (29/59, 49.2%, P?=?0.19), inotropic therapy alone inotropic therapy P?=?0.23) as compared to no therapy (108/275, 39.3%). Following adjustment for treatment propensity score, RBC transfusion was associated with a decreased adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of in-hospital mortality among patients with hemoglobin values less than 10 g/dL (aOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.97, P?=?0.04) while inotropic therapy was not associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with hemoglobin values of 10 g/dL or greater (aOR 1.16, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.96, P?=?0.57). Among patients with septic shock treated with EGDT in the setting of subnormal ScvO2 values despite meeting CVP and MAP target goals, treatment with RBC transfusion may be independently associated with decreased in-hospital fourth edition.

Towards Smarter Lumping and Smarter Splitting: Rethinking Strategies for Sepsis and ARDS Clinical Trial Design Both quality improvement and clinical research efforts over the past few decades have focused on consensus definition of sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although clinical definitions based on readily available clinical data have advanced recognition and timely use of broad supportive treatments, they likely hinder the identification of more targeted therapies that manipulate select biological mechanisms underlying critical illness. Sepsis and ARDS are by definition heterogeneous, and patients vary in both their underlying biology and their severity of illness. We have long been able to identify subtypes of sepsis and ARDS that confer different prognoses. The key is that we are now on the verge of identifying subtypes that may confer different response to therapy. In this perspective, inspired by a 2015 American Thoracic Society International Conference Symposium entitled \"Lumpers and Splitters: Phenotyping in Critical Illness,\" we highlight promising approaches to uncovering patient subtypes that may predict treatment responsiveness and not just differences in prognosis. We then discuss how this information can be leveraged to improve the success and translatability of clinical trials by using predictive enrichment and other design strategies. Last, we discuss the challenges and limitations to identifying biomarkers and endotypes and incorporating them into routine Jul 15;194(2):147-55. Trans-ethnic Meta-Analysis and Functional Annotation Illuminates the Genetic Architecture of Fasting Glucose and Insulin Knowledge of the genetic basis of the type 2 diabetes (T2D)-related quantitative traits fasting glucose (FG) and insulin (FI) in African ancestry (AA) individuals has been limited. In non-diabetic subjects of AA (n = 20,209) and European ancestry (EA; n = 57,292), we performed trans-ethnic (AA+EA) fine-mapping of 54 established EA FG or FI loci with detailed functional annotation, assessed their relevance in AA individuals, and sought previously undescribed loci through trans-ethnic (AA+EA) meta-analysis. We narrowed credible driving signals for 22/54 EA-associated loci; 18/22 credible overlapped with active or transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and 21/22 contained at least one TF motif. Of the 54 EA-associated loci, 23 were shared between EA and AA. Replication with an additional 10,096 AA individuals identified two previously annotation illuminate the genetic architecture of glycemic traits and suggest gene regulation as a target to advance precision medicine for T2D. Our approach to utilize state-of-the-art functional annotation and implement trans-ethnic association analysis for discovery and fine-mapping offers a framework for further follow-up and characterization of GWAS signals of complex trait loci.

Methods for using clinical laboratory test results as baseline confounders in multi-site observational database studies when missing data are expected Our purpose was to quantify missing baseline laboratory results, assess predictors of missingness, and examine performance of missing data methods. Using the Mini-Sentinel Distributed Database from three sites, we selected three exposure-outcome scenarios with laboratory results as baseline confounders. We compared hazard ratios (HRs) or risk differences (RDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from models that omitted laboratory results, included only available results (complete cases), and included results after applying missing data methods (multiple imputation [MI] regression, MI predictive mean matching [PMM] indicator). Scenario 1 considered glucose among second-generation antipsychotic users and diabetes. Across sites, glucose was available for 27.7-58.9%. Results differed between complete case and missing data models (e.g., olanzapine: HR 0.92 [CI 0.73, 1.12] vs 1.02 [0.90, 1.16]). Across-site models different MI approaches provided similar HR and CI; site-specific models provided differing estimates. Scenario 2 evaluated creatinine among individuals starting high versus low dose lisinopril and hyperkalemia. Creatinine availability: 44.5-79.0%. Results differed between complete case and missing data models (e.g., HR 0.84 [CI 0.77, 0.92] vs. 0.88 [0.83, 0.94]). HR and CI were identical across MI methods. Scenario 3 examined international normalized ratio (INR) among warfarin users starting interacting versus noninteracting antimicrobials and bleeding. INR availability: 20.0-92.9%. Results differed between ignoring INR versus including INR using missing data methods (e.g., RD 0.05 [CI -0.03, 0.13] vs 0.09 [0.00, 0.18]). Indicator and PMM gave similar estimates. Multi-site studies must consider site variability in missing data. Different missing data methods performed similarly. Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Jul;25(7):798-814.

Differences in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) can occur based on ostomy status (permanent ostomy vs anastomosis). To describe alterations in sexual function and HRQOL based on ostomy status in long-term (5 years) survivors of RC. Survivors of RC with an ostomy (n = 181) or anastomosis (n = 394) were surveyed using validated HRQOL and functional status tools. We compared sexuality outcomes between the ostomy and anastomosis groups and reported differences adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics. Qualitative data from one open-ended question on survivors' greatest challenges since their surgery were analyzed to explore sexuality, symptoms, and relationships. Whether sexually active, satisfaction with sexual activity, and select sexual dysfunction items from the Modified City of Hope Quality of Life-Colorectal. Survivors with a permanent ostomy were more likely to have been sexually inactive after surgery if it occurred before 2000 and experience dissatisfaction with appearance, interference with personal relationships and intimacy, and lower overall HRQOL. Female survivors of RC with an ostomy were more likely to have problems with vaginal strictures and vaginal pain after surgery that persisted at the time of the survey (5 years later). Radiation treatment, tumor stage, soilage of garments in bed, and higher Charlson-Deyo comorbidity scores were negatively associated with outcomes. Six qualitative themes emerged: loss of and decreased sexual activity, psychological issues with sexual activity, physical issues with sexual activity, partner rejection, ostomy interference with sexual activity, and positive experiences with sexuality. Sexual dysfunction is a common long-term sequela of RC treatment, with more problems observed in survivors with a permanent ostomy. This warrants widespread implementation of targeted interventions to manage sexual dysfunction and improve HRQOL for these survivors. Med. 2016 Jul;13(7):1071-9. Is a reduction in distance to nearest supermarket associated with BMI change among type 2 diabetes patients? We examined whether residing within 2 miles of a new supermarket opening was longitudinally associated with a change in body mass index (BMI). We identified 12 new supermarkets that opened between 2009 and 2010 in 8 neighborhoods. Using the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, we identified members with type 2 diabetes residing continuously in any of these neighborhoods 12 months prior to the first supermarket opening until 10 months following the opening of the last supermarket. Exposure was defined as a reduction (yes/no) in travel distance to the nearest supermarket as a result of a new supermarket opening. First difference regression models were used to estimate the impact of reduced supermarket distance on BMI, adjusting for longitudinal changes in patient and neighborhood characteristics. Among patients in the exposed group, new supermarket openings reduced travel distance to the nearest supermarket by 0.7 miles on average. However, reduced distance to nearest supermarket was not associated with BMI changes. Overall, we found no evidence that reduced supermarket distance was associated with reduced levels of obesity for residents with type 2 diabetes. Authors: Zhang 2016-05-07. Big data in health care: using analytics to identify and manage high-risk and high-cost patients The US health care system is rapidly adopting electronic health records, which will dramatically increase the quantity of clinical data that are available electronically. Simultaneously, rapid progress has been made in clinical analytics-techniques for analyzing large quantities of data and gleaning new insights from that analysis-which is part of what is known as big data. As a result, there are unprecedented opportunities to use big data to reduce the costs of health care in the United States. We present six use cases-that is, key examples-where some of the clearest opportunities exist to reduce costs through the use of big data: high-cost patients, readmissions, triage, decompensation (when a patient's condition worsens), adverse events, and treatment optimization for diseases affecting multiple organ systems. We discuss the types of insights that are likely to emerge from clinical analytics, the types of data needed to obtain such insights, and the infrastructure-analytics, algorithms, registries, assessment scores, monitoring devices, and so forth-that organizations will need to perform the necessary analyses and to implement changes that will improve care while reducing costs. Our findings have policy implications for regulatory oversight, ways to address privacy concerns, and the support of research on analytics.

Health-Specific Information and Communication Technology Use and Its Relationship to Obesity in High-Poverty, Urban Communities: Analysis of a Population-Based Biosocial Survey More than 35% of American adults are obese. For African American and Hispanic adults, as well as individuals residing in poorer or more racially segregated urban neighborhoods, the likelihood of obesity is even higher. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) may substitute for or complement community-based resources for weight management. However, little is currently known about health-specific ICT use among urban-dwelling people with obesity. We describe health-specific ICT use and its relationship to measured obesity among adults in high-poverty urban communities. Using data collected between November 2012 and July 2013 from a population-based probability sample of urban-dwelling African American and Hispanic adults residing on the South Side of Chicago, we described patterns of ICT use in relation to measured obesity defined by a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m(2). Among those with BMI30 kg/m(2), we also assessed the association between health-specific ICT use and diagnosed versus undiagnosed obesity as well as differences in health-specific ICT use by self-reported comorbidities, including diabetes and hypertension. The survey response rate was 44.6% (267 completed surveys/598.4 eligible or likely eligible individuals); 53.2% were African American and 34.6% were Hispanic. More than 35% of the population reported an annual income of less than US $25,000. The population prevalence of measured obesity was 50.2%. People with measured obesity (BMI30 kg/m(2)) were more likely to report both general 67.0%, P=.04) and health-specific (61.1% vs 41.2%, P=.01) ICT use. In contrast, among those with measured obesity, being told of this diagnosis by a physician was not associated with increased health-specific ICT use. People with measured obesity alone had higher rates of health-specific use than those with comorbid hypertension and/or diabetes diagnoses (77.1% vs 60.7% vs 47.4%, P=.04). In conclusion, ICT-based health resources may be particularly useful for people in high-poverty urban communities with isolated measured obesity, a population that is at high risk for poor health Med Internet Res. 2016 Jun 28;18(6):e182.

Rationale and Design of the Randomized Evaluation of Default Access to Palliative Services (REDAPS) Trial The substantial nationwide investment in inpatient palliative care services stems from their great promise to improve patient-centered outcomes and reduce costs. However, robust experimental evidence of these benefits is lacking. The Randomized Evaluation of Default Access to Palliative Services (REDAPS) study is a pragmatic, stepped-wedge, cluster randomized trial designed to test the efficacy and costs of specialized palliative care consultative services for hospitalized patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, or end-stage renal disease, as well as the overall effectiveness of ordering such services by default. Additional aims are to identify the types of services that are most beneficial and the types of patients most likely to benefit, including comparisons between ward and ICU patients. We hypothesize that patient-centered outcomes can be improved without raising costs by simply changing the default option for palliative care consultation from opt-in to opt-out for patients with life-limiting illnesses. Patients aged 45 years or older are enrolled at 11 hospitals using an integrated electronic health record (EHR). As a pragmatic trial designed to enroll between 12,000 and 15,000 patients, eligibility is determined using a validated, EHR-based algorithm, and all outcomes are captured via the EHR and billing systems data. The time at which each hospital transitions from control, opt-in palliative care consultation to intervention, opt-out consultation, is randomly assigned. The primary outcome is a composite measure of in-hospital mortality and length of stay. Secondary outcomes include palliative care process measures and clinical and economic outcomes. The REDAPS trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02505035 on M; Halpern SD Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2016 Jun 27. Association Among ICU Congestion, ICU Admission Decision, and Patient Outcomes To employ automated bed data to examine whether ICU occupancy influences ICU admission decisions and patient outcomes. Retrospective study using an instrumental variable to remove biases from unobserved differences in illness severity for patients admitted to ICU. Fifteen hospitals in an integrated healthcare delivery system in California. Seventy thousand one hundred thirty-three episodes involving patients admitted via emergency departments to a medical service over a 1-year period between 2008 and 2009. None. A third of patients admitted via emergency department to a medical service were admitted under high ICU congestion (more than 90% of beds occupied). High ICU congestion was associated with a 9% lower likelihood of ICU admission for patients defined as eligible for ICU admission. We further found strong associations between ICU admission and patient outcomes, with a 32% lower likelihood of hospital readmission if the first inpatient unit was an ICU. Similarly, hospital length of stay decreased by 33% and likelihood of transfer to ICU from other units-including ICU readmission if the first unit was an ICU-decreased by 73%. High ICU congestion is associated with a lower likelihood of ICU admission, which has important operational implications and can affect patient outcomes. By taking advantage of our ability to identify a subset of patients whose ICU admission decisions are affected by congestion, we found that, if congestion were not a barrier and more eligible patients were admitted to ICU, this hospital system could save approximately 7.5 hospital readmissions and 253.8 hospital days per year. These findings could help inform future capacity planning and staffing decisions. Authors: Kim SH; Chan CW; Olivares M; Escobar GJ Crit Care Med. 2016 Jun 21. The Diabetes Telephone Study: Design and challenges of a pragmatic cluster randomized trial to improve diabetic peripheral neuropathy treatment Challenges to effective pharmacologic management of symptomatic diabetic peripheral neuropathy include the limited effectiveness of available medicines, frequent side effects, and the need for ongoing symptom assessment and treatment titration for maximal effectiveness. We present here the rationale and implementation challenges of the Diabetes Telephone Study, a randomized trial designed to improve medication treatment, titration, and quality of life among patients with symptomatic diabetic peripheral neuropathy. We implemented a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of an automated interactive voice response tool designed to provide physicians with real-time patient-reported data about responses to newly prescribed diabetic peripheral neuropathy medicines. A total of 1834 primary care physicians treating patients in the diabetes registry at Kaiser Permanente Northern California were randomized into the intervention or control arm. In September 2014, we began identification and recruitment of patients assigned to physicians in the intervention group who receive three brief interactive calls every 2 months after a medication is prescribed to alleviate diabetic peripheral neuropathy symptoms. These calls provide patients with the opportunity to report on symptoms, side effects, self-titration of medication dose and overall satisfaction with treatment. We plan to compare changes in self-reported quality of life between the intervention group and patients in the control group who receive three non-interactive automated educational phone calls. Successful implementation of this clinical trial required robust stakeholder engagement to help tailor the intervention and to address pragmatic concerns such as provider time constraints. As of 27 October 2015, we had screened 2078 patients, 1447 of whom were eligible for participation. We consented and enrolled 1206 or 83% of those eligible. Among those enrolled, 53% are women and the mean age is 67 (standard deviation = 12) years. The racial ethnic make-up is 56% White, 8% Asian, 13% Black or African American, and 19% Hispanic or Latino. Innovative strategies are needed to guide improvements in healthcare delivery for patients with symptomatic diabetic peripheral neuropathy. This trial aims to assess whether real-time collection and clinical feedback of patient treatment experiences can reduce patient symptom burden. Implementation of a clinical trial closely involving clinical care required researchers to partner with clinicians. If successful, this intervention provides a critical information feedback loop that would optimize diabetic peripheral neuropathy medication titration through widely available interactive voice Clin Trials. 2016 Jun;13(3):286-93.

Multicenter Implementation of a Treatment Bundle for Sepsis Patients with Intermediate Lactate Values Treatments for patients with sepsis with intermediate lactate values (?2 and <4 mmol/L) are poorly defined. To evaluate multicenter implementation of a treatment bundle (including timed intervals for antibiotics, repeat lactate testing, and intravenous fluids) for hemodynamically stable patients with sepsis and intermediate lactate values in the emergency department. We evaluated patients in annual intervals before and after bundle implementation in March 2013. We evaluated bundle compliance and compared outcome measures across groups with multivariable logistic regression. Because of their perceived risk for iatrogenic fluid overload, we also evaluated patients with a history of heart failure and/or chronic kidney disease. We identified 18,122 patients with sepsis and intermediate lactate values, including 36.1% treated after implementation. Full bundle compliance increased from 32.2% in 2011 to 44.9% after bundle implementation (P?0.01). Hospital mortality was 8.8% in 2011, 9.3% in 2012, and 7.9% in 2013 (P?=?0.02). Treatment after bundle implementation was associated with an adjusted hospital mortality odds ratio of 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.99; P?=?0.04). Decreased hospital mortality was observed primarily in patients with a heart failure and/or kidney disease history (P?0.01) compared with patients without this history (P?>?0.40). This corresponded to notable changes in the volume of fluid resuscitation in patients with heart failure and/or kidney disease after implementation. Multicenter implementation of a treatment bundle for patients with sepsis and intermediate lactate values improved bundle compliance and was associated with decreased hospital mortality. These decreases were mediated by improved mortality and increased fluid administration among patients with a history of heart failure and/or chronic kidney disease.

Developing a framework for implementing intensive care unit diaries: a focused review of the literature Intensive care unit diaries have been shown to improve post-critical illness recovery, however, prior reports of diary implementation are heterogeneous. We sought to construct a common framework for designing and implementing Intensive Care Unit diaries based on prior studies. We conducted a focused review of the literature regarding intensive care diaries based on a systematic search of several databases. Two reviewers assessed 56 studies and data were abstracted from a total of 25 eligible studies conducted between 1990 and 2014. We identified key information regarding the development, design, and implementation of the journals. We then grouped elements that appeared consistently across these studies within three main categories: (1) diary target populations; (2) diary format and content; and (3) the manner of diary return and follow-up. Most studies were conducted in European countries in adult intensive care units and targeted patients in both medical and surgical units. The timing of diary initiation was based on the elapsed length of stay or duration of mechanical ventilation. We categorised diary format and content as: entry content, authors, use of standardised headings, type of language, initiation, frequency of entries, and physical location of diaries. Diaries were hand written and many studies found that photographs were an essential element in ICU diaries. We categorised the manner of diary return and follow-up. The context in which intensive care unit diaries were returned were felt to be important factors in improving the use of diaries in recovery. In conclusion, we describe a common framework for the future development of intensive care unit diaries that revolves around the target population for the diaries, their format and content, and the timing of their use. Future studies should address how these elements impact the mechanisms by which intensive are diaries exert beneficial effects. Authors: Beg M; Scruth E; Liu V Aust Crit Care. 2016 May 27. Greater hippocampal volume is associated with PTSD treatment response. Previous research associates smaller hippocampal volume with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear, however, whether treatment affects hippocampal volume or vice versa. Seventy-six subjects, 40 PTSD patients and 36 matched trauma-exposed healthy resilient controls, underwent clinical assessments and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, and 10 weeks later, during which PTSD patients completed ten weeks of Prolonged Exposure (PE) treatment. The resilient controls and treatment responders (n=23) had greater baseline hippocampal volume than treatment non-responders (n=17) (p=0.012 and p=0.050, respectively), perhaps due to more robust fear-extinction capacity in both the initial phase after exposure to trauma and during treatment. 30;252:36-39. doi: 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2016.05.001.

The Natural History of Changes in Preferences for Life-Sustaining Treatments and Implications for Inpatient Mortality in Younger and Older Hospitalized Adults To compare changes in preferences for life-sustaining treatments (LSTs) and subsequent mortality of younger and older inpatients. Retrospective cohort study. Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Individuals hospitalized at 21 KPNC hospitals between 2008 and 2012 (N = 227,525). Participants were divided according to age (<65, 65-84, 85). The effect of age on adding new and reversing prior LST limitations was evaluated. Survival to inpatient discharge was compared according to age group after adding new LST limitations. At admission, 18,254 (54.2%) of those aged 85 and older, 18,349 (20.8%) of those aged 65 to 84, and 3,258 (3.1%) of those younger than 65 had requested that the use of LST be limited. Of the 187,664 participants who initially did not request limitations on the use of LST, 15,932 (8.5%) had new LST limitations added; of the 39,861 admitted with LST limitations, 3,017 (7.6%) had these reversed. New limitations were more likely to be seen in older participants (aged 65-84, odds ratio (OR) = 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.16-2.39; aged 85, OR = 6.43, 95% CI = 6.05-6.84), and reversals of prior limitations were less likely to be seen in older individuals (aged 65-84, OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.65-0.83; aged 85, OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.41-0.53) than in those younger than 65. Survival rates to inpatient discharge were 71.7% of subjects aged 85 and older who added new limitations, 57.2% of those aged 65 to 84, and 43.4% of those younger than 65 (P < .001). Changes in preferences for LSTs were common in hospitalized individuals. Age was an important determinant of likelihood of adding new or reversing prior LST limitations. Of subjects who added LST limitations, those who were older were more likely than those who were younger to survive to hospital discharge.

Communication Barriers and the Clinical Recognition of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in a Diverse Cohort of Adults: The DISTANCE Study The purpose of this study was to explore communication barriers as independent predictors and potential mediators of variation in clinical recognition of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). In this cross-sectional analysis, we estimated the likelihood of having a DPN diagnosis among 4,436 patients with DPN symptoms. We controlled for symptom frequency, demographic and clinical characteristics, and visit frequency using a modified Poisson regression model. We then evaluated 4 communication barriers as independent predictors of clinical documentation and as possible mediators of racial/ethnic differences: difficulty speaking English, not talking to one's doctor about pain, limited health literacy, and reports of suboptimal patient-provider communication. Difficulty speaking English and not talking with one's doctor about pain were independently associated with not having a diagnosis, though limited health literacy and suboptimal patient-provider communication were not. Limited English proficiency partially attenuated, but did not fully explain, racial/ethnic differences in clinical documentation among Chinese, Latino, and Filipino patients. Providers should be encouraged to talk with their patients about DPN symptoms, and health systems should consider enhancing strategies to improve timely clinical recognition of DPN among patients who have difficult speaking English. More work is needed to understand persistent racial/ethnic differences in diagnosis. Authors: 2016 May;21(5):544-53. Epub 2016-04-26. Associations of perceived neighborhood safety and crime with cardiometabolic risk factors among a population with type 2 diabetes Little is known about how neighborhood crime may relate to health in diabetes patients. We examined associations between individuals' perceptions of neighborhood safety or violent crime and stress, physical activity, body mass index (BMI) or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in a sample (n=721) of adults (mean age:63) with diabetes. Self-reported neighborhood safety, violent crime, physical activity, and stress were collected and linked to clinical measures of BMI and HbA1c. Approximately 54% and 15% of patients reported neighborhood safety concerns and violent crimes, respectively. Any neighborhood safety concerns (=1.14, 95% C.I. 0.04-2.24) and were associated with BMI in adjusted analysis. Any violent crime was associated with class II-III obesity (BMI35) (OR=1.34, 95% C.I.: 1.02, 1.75). There were no significant associations between neighborhood safety concerns or violent crime with stress, physical activity, or HbA1c. Neighborhood safety is associated with BMI and obesity. Further studies, including longitudinal designs, are needed to study how people with diabetes may be influenced by a sense of poor personal safety in their neighborhoods. Epub 2016-04-08.

Financial Strain and Medication Adherence among Diabetes Patients in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System: The Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) To examine self-reported financial strain in relation to pharmacy utilization adherence data. Survey, administrative, and electronic medical data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Retrospective cohort design (2006, n = 7,773). We compared survey self-reports of general and medication-specific financial strain to three adherence outcomes from pharmacy records, specifying adjusted generalized linear regression models. Eight percent and 9 percent reported general and medication-specific financial strain. In adjusted models, general strain was significantly associated with primary nonadherence (RR = 1.37; 95 percent CI: 1.04-1.81) and refilling (RR = 1.34; 95 percent CI: 1.07-1.66); and medication-specific strain was associated with primary nonadherence (RR = 1.42, 95 percent CI: 1.09-1.84). Simple, minimally intrusive questions could be used to identify patients at risk of poor adherence due to financial barriers. Authors: Refilling medications through an online patient portal: consistent improvements in adherence across racial/ethnic groups Online patient portals are being widely implemented; however, no studies have examined whether portals influence health behaviors or outcomes similarly across patient racial/ethnic subgroups. We evaluated longitudinal changes in statin adherence to determine whether racial/ethnic minorities initiating use of the online refill function in patient portals had similar changes over time compared with Whites. We examined a retrospective cohort of diabetes patients who were existing patient portal users. The primary exposure was initiating online refill use (either exclusively for all statin refills or occasionally for some refills), compared with using the portal for other tasks (eg, exchanging secure messages with providers). The primary outcome was change in statin adherence, measured as the percentage of time a patient was without a supply of statins. Adjusted generalized estimating equation models controlled for race/ethnicity as a primary interaction term. Fifty-eight percent of patient portal users were white, and all racial/ethnic minority groups had poorer baseline statin adherence compared with Whites. In adjusted difference-in-difference models, statin adherence improved significantly over time among patients who exclusively refilled prescriptions online, even after comparing changes over time with other portal users (4% absolute decrease in percentage of time without medication). This improvement was statistically similar across all racial/ethnic groups. Patient portals may encourage or improve key health behaviors, such as medication adherence, for engaged patients, but further research will likely be required to reduce underlying racial/ethnic differences in adherence. In a well-controlled examination of diabetes patients' behavior when using a new online feature for their healthcare management, patient portals were linked to better medication adherence across all racial/ethnic Med Inform Assoc. 2016 Apr;23(e1):e28-33.

Diabetes and Prior Coronary Heart Disease are Not Necessarily Risk Equivalent for Future Coronary Heart Disease Events For more than a decade, the presence of diabetes has been considered a coronary heart disease (CHD) \"risk equivalent\". The objective of this study was to revisit the concept of risk equivalence by comparing the risk of subsequent CHD events among individuals with or without history of diabetes or CHD in a large contemporary real-world cohort over a period of 10 years (2002 to 2011). Population-based prospective cohort analysis. We studied a cohort of 1,586,061 adult members (ages 30-90 years) of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated health care delivery system. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) from Cox proportional hazard models for CHD among four fixed cohorts, defined by prevalent (baseline) risk group: no history of diabetes or CHD (None), prior CHD alone (CHD), diabetes alone (DM), and diabetes and prior CHD (DM?+?CHD). We observed 80,012 new CHD events over the follow-up period (~10,980,800 person-years). After multivariable adjustment, the HRs (reference: None) for new CHD events were as follows: CHD alone, 2.8 (95% CI, 2.7-2.85); DM alone 1.7 (95% CI, 1.66-1.74); DM?+?CHD, 3.9 (95% CI, 3.8-4.0). Individuals with diabetes alone had significantly lower risk of CHD across all age and sex strata compared to those with CHD alone (12.2 versus 22.5 per 1000 person-years). The risk of future CHD for patients with a history of either DM or CHD was similar only among those with diabetes of long duration (?10 years). Not all individuals with diabetes should be unconditionally assumed to be a risk equivalent of those with prior CHD. Authors: Rana JS; Liu JY; Moffet HH; 2016 Apr;31(4):387-93. Epub 2015-12-14. Acceptance of Lean redesigns in primary care: A contextual analysis Lean is a leading change strategy used in health care to achieve short-term efficiency and quality improvement while promising longer-term system transformation. Most research examines Lean intervention to address isolated problems, rather than to achieve broader systemic changes to care delivery. Moreover, no studies examine contextual influences on system-wide Lean implementation efforts in primary care. The aim of this study was to identify contextual factors most critical to implementing and scaling Lean redesigns across all primary care clinics in a large, ambulatory care delivery system. Over 100 interviews and focus groups were conducted with frontline physicians, clinical staff, and operational leaders. Data analysis was guided by a modified Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), a popular implementation science framework. On the basis of expert recommendations, the modified framework targets factors influencing the implementation of process redesigns. This modified framework, the CFIR-PR, informed our identification of contextual factors that most impacted Lean acceptance among frontline physicians and staff. Several domains identified by the CFIR-PR were critical to acceptance of Lean redesigns. Regarding the implementation process acceptance was influenced by time and intensity of exposure to changes, \"top-down\" versus \"bottom-up\" implementation styles, and degrees of employee engagement in developing new workflows. Important factors in the inner setting were the clinic's culture and style of leadership, along with availability of information about Lean's effectiveness. Last, implementation efforts were impacted by individual and team characteristics regarding changed work roles and related issues of professional identity, authority, and autonomy. This study underscores the need for change leaders to consider the contextual factors that surround efforts to implement Lean in primary care. As Lean redesigns are scaled across a system, special attention is warranted with respect to the implementation approach, internal clinic setting, and implications for professional roles and identities of physicians and staff.

Added sugar intake and metabolic syndrome in US adolescents: cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2012. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between added sugar intake and metabolic syndrome among adolescents. DESIGN: Dietary, serum biomarker, anthropometric and physical activity data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles between 2005 and 2012 were analysed using multivariate logistic regression models. Added sugar intake in grams per day was estimated from two 24 h standardized dietary recalls and then separated into quintiles from lowest to highest consumption. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were adjusted for physical activity, age, BMI Z-score and energy intake, and their interactions with race were included. SETTING: Nationally representative sample, USA. SUBJECTS: US adolescents aged 12-19 years (n 1623). RESULTS: Added sugar was significantly associated with metabolic syndrome. The adjusted prevalence odds ratios for having metabolic syndrome comparing adolescents in the third, fourth and fifth quintiles v. those in the lowest quintile of added sugar were 5.3 (95 % CI 1.4, 20.6), 9.9 (95 % CI 1.9, 50.9) and 8.7 (95 % CI 1.4, 54.9), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that higher added sugar intake, independent of total energy intake, physical activity or BMI Z-score, is associated with increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome in US adolescents. Further studies are needed to determine if reducing intake of added sugar may help US adolescents prevent or reverse metabolic Epub 2016 Mar 2. Severe Hypoglycemia Requiring Medical Intervention in a Large Cohort of Adults With Diabetes Receiving Care in U.S. Integrated Health Care Delivery Systems: 2005-2011 Appropriate glycemic control is fundamental to diabetes care, but aggressive glucose targets and intensive therapy may unintentionally increase episodes of hypoglycemia. We quantified the burden of severe hypoglycemia requiring medical intervention in a well-defined population of insured individuals with diabetes receiving care in integrated health care delivery systems across the U.S. This observational cohort study included 917,440 adults with diabetes receiving care during 2005 to 2011 at participating SUrveillance, PREvention, and ManagEment of Diabetes Mellitus (SUPREME-DM) network sites. Severe hypoglycemia rates were based on any occurrence of hypoglycemia-related ICD-9 codes from emergency department or inpatient medical encounters and reported overall and by age, sex, comorbidity status, antecedent A1C level, and medication use. Annual rates of severe hypoglycemia ranged from 1.4 to 1.6 events per 100 person-years. Rates of severe hypoglycemia were higher among those with older age, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, cardiovascular disease, depression, and higher A1C levels, and in users of insulin, insulin secretagogues, or ?-blockers (P < 0.001 for all). Changes in severe hypoglycemia occurrence over time were not clinically significant in the cohort as a whole but were observed in subgroups of individuals with chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and cardiovascular disease. Risk of severe hypoglycemia in clinical settings is considerably higher in identifiable patient subgroups than in randomized controlled trials. Strategies that reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in high-risk patients are needed. Authors: Pathak RD; Karter AJ; Pre-visit prioritization for complex patients with Diabetes: Randomized Trial Design and Implementation within an Integrated Health Care system Despite robust evidence to guide clinical care, most patients with diabetes do not meet all goals of risk factor control. Improved patient-provider communication during time-limited primary care visits may represent one strategy for improving diabetes care. We designed a controlled, cluster-randomized, multi-site intervention (Pre-Visit Prioritization for Complex Patients with Diabetes) that enables patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes to identify their top priorities prior to a scheduled visit and sends these priorities to the primary care physician progress note in the electronic medical record. In this paper, we describe strategies to address challenges to implementing our health IT-based intervention study within a large health care system. This study is being conducted in 30 primary care practices within a large integrated care delivery system in Northern California. Over a 12-week period (3/1/2015-6/6/2015), 146 primary care physicians consented to enroll in the study (90.1%) and approved contact with 2496 of their patients (97.6%). Implementation challenges included: (1) navigating research vs. quality improvement requirements; (2) addressing informed consent considerations; and (3) introducing a new clinical tool into a highly time-constrained workflow. Strategies for successfully initiating this study included engagement with institutional leaders, Institutional Review Board members, and clinical stakeholders at multiple stages both before and after notice of Federal funding; flexibility by the research team in study design; and strong support from institutional leadership for \"self-learning health system\" research. By paying careful attention to identifying and collaborating with a wide range of key clinical stakeholders, we have shown that researchers embedded within a learning care system can successfully apply rigorous clinical trial methods to test new care innovations.

Evaluation Following Staggered Implementation of the \"Rethinking Critical Care\" ICU Care Bundle in a Multicenter Community Setting To evaluate process metrics and outcomes after implementation of the \"Rethinking Critical Care\" ICU care bundle in a community setting. Retrospective interrupted time-series analysis. Three hospitals in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated healthcare delivery system. ICU patients admitted between January 1, 2009, and August 30, 2013. Implementation of the Rethinking Critical Care ICU care bundle which is designed to reduce potentially preventable complications by focusing on the management of delirium, sedation, mechanical ventilation, mobility, ambulation, and coordinated care. Rethinking Critical Care implementation occurred in a staggered fashion between October 2011 and November 2012. We measured implementation metrics based on electronic medical record data and evaluated the impact of implementation on mortality with multivariable regression models for 24,886 first ICU episodes in 19,872 patients. After implementation, some process metrics (e.g., ventilation start and stop times) were achieved at high rates, whereas others (e.g., ambulation distance), available late in the study period, showed steep increases in compliance. Unadjusted mortality decreased from 12.3% to 10.9% (p < 0.01) before and after implementation, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for hospital mortality after implementation was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.99) and for 30-day mortality was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80-0.97) compared with before implementation. However, the mortality rate trends were not significantly different before and after Rethinking Critical Care implementation. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay also did not demonstrate incrementally greater declines after implementation. Rethinking Critical Care implementation was associated with changes in practice and a 12-15% reduction in the odds of short-term mortality. However, these findings may represent an evaluation of changes in practices and outcomes still in the midimplementation phase and cannot be directly attributed to the elements of bundle implementation.

Developing a New Definition and Assessing New Clinical Criteria for Septic Shock: For the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) Septic shock currently refers to a state of acute circulatory failure associated with infection. Emerging biological insights and reported variation in epidemiology challenge the validity of this definition. To develop a new definition and clinical criteria for identifying septic shock in adults. The Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine convened a task force (19 participants) to revise current sepsis/septic shock definitions. Three sets of studies were conducted: (1) a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies in adults published between January 1, 1992, and December 25, 2015, to determine clinical criteria currently reported to identify septic shock and inform the Delphi process; (2) a Delphi study among the task force comprising 3 surveys and discussions of results from the systematic review, surveys, and cohort studies to achieve consensus on a new septic shock definition and clinical criteria; and (3) cohort studies to test variables identified by the Delphi process using Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) (2005-2010; n?=?28,150), University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) (2009-2013; n?=?1,847,165) electronic health record (EHR) data sets. Evidence for and agreement on septic shock definitions and criteria. The systematic review identified 44 studies reporting septic shock outcomes (total of 166,479 patients) from a total of 92 sepsis epidemiology studies reporting different cutoffs and combinations for blood pressure (BP), fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, serum lactate level, and base deficit to identify septic shock. The septic shock-associated crude mortality was 46.5% (95% serum lactate level, and vasopressor therapy as variables to test using cohort studies. Based on these 3 variables alone or in combination, 6 patient groups were generated. Examination of the SSC database demonstrated that the patient group requiring vasopressors to maintain mean BP 65 mm Hg or greater and having a serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) after fluid resuscitation had a significantly higher mortality (42.3% [95% CI, 41.2%-43.3%]) in risk-adjusted comparisons with the other 5 groups derived using either serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L alone or combinations of hypotension, vasopressors, and serum lactate level 2 mmol/L or lower. These findings were validated in the UPMC and KPNC data sets. Based on a consensus process using results from a systematic review, surveys, and cohort studies, septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone. Adult patients with septic shock can be identified using the clinical criteria of hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy to maintain mean BP 65 mm Hg or greater and having a serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L after Force JAMA. 2016 Feb 23;315(8):775-87. Assessment of Clinical Criteria for Sepsis: For the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) The Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force defined sepsis as \"life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection.\" The performance of clinical criteria for this sepsis definition is unknown. To evaluate the validity of clinical criteria to identify patients with suspected infection who are at risk of sepsis. Among 1.3 million electronic health record encounters from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012, at 12 hospitals in southwestern Pennsylvania, we identified those with suspected infection in whom to compare criteria. Confirmatory analyses were performed in 4 data sets of 706,399 out-of-hospital and hospital encounters at 165 US and non-US hospitals ranging from January 1, 2008, until December 31, 2013. Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS) score, and a new model derived using multivariable logistic regression in a split sample, the quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score (range, 0-3 points, with 1 point each for hypotension [?100 mm Hg], tachypnea [?22/min], or altered mentation). For construct validity, pairwise agreement was assessed. For predictive validity, the discrimination for outcomes (primary: in-hospital mortality; secondary: in-hospital mortality or intensive care unit [ICU] length of stay ?3 days) more common in sepsis than uncomplicated infection was determined. Results were expressed as the fold change in outcome over deciles of baseline risk of death and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). In the primary cohort, 148,907 encounters had suspected infection (n?=?74,453 derivation; n?=?74,454 validation), of whom 6347 (4%) died. Among ICU encounters in the validation cohort (n?=?7932 with suspected infection, of whom 1289 [16%] died), the predictive validity for in-hospital mortality was SIRS both). Among non-ICU encounters in the validation cohort (n?=?66?522 with suspected infection, of whom 1886 [3%] died), qSOFA had predictive validity (AUROC?=?0.81; 95% CI, was qSOFA scores lower than 2, encounters with qSOFA scores of 2 or higher had a 3- to 14-fold increase in hospital mortality across baseline risk deciles. Findings were similar in external data sets and for the secondary outcome. Among ICU encounters with suspected infection, the predictive validity for in-hospital mortality of SOFA was not significantly different than the more complex LODS but was statistically greater than SIRS and qSOFA, supporting its use in clinical criteria for sepsis. Among encounters with suspected infection outside of the ICU, the predictive validity for in-hospital mortality of qSOFA was statistically greater than SOFA and SIRS, supporting its use as a prompt to consider possible sepsis.

PTSD REMISSION AFTER PROLONGED EXPOSURE TREATMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX THINNING AND VOLUME REDUCTION. BACKGROUND: Brain structures underlying posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been a focus of imaging studies, but associations between treatment outcome and alterations in brain structures remain largely unexamined. We longitudinally examined the relation of structural changes in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), a previously identified key region in the PTSD fear network, to outcome of prolonged exposure (PE) treatment. METHOD: The sample included 78 adults (53 women): 41 patients with PTSD and 37 trauma-exposed healthy volunteers (TE-HCs). Patients underwent a 10-week course of PE treatment and completed pre- and posttreatment assessments and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural scans. TE-HCs also underwent assessment and MRI at baseline and 10 weeks later. PE remitters (n = 11), nonremitters (n = 14), and TE-HCs, were compared at baseline on demographic and clinical characteristics and ACC structure. Remitters, nonremitters, and TE-HCs were compared for pre- to posttreatment clinical and structural ACC change, controlling for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: There were no baseline differences in structure between PTSD and TE-HCs or remitters and nonremitters. Following treatment, PTSD remitters exhibited cortical thinning and volume decrease in the left rACC compared with PTSD nonremitters and TE-HCs. CONCLUSIONS: These results, while in need of replication, suggest that PE treatment for PTSD, by extinguishing maladaptive trauma associations, may promote synaptic plasticity and structure change in rACC.

The Value of Ultrasound Monitoring of Adnexal Masses for Early Detection of Ovarian Cancer Although ultrasound has so far been found to be ineffective as a screening tool for ovarian cancer, it is commonly used as a means of evaluating or following ovarian or adnexal masses once they are detected. We review the use of serial ultrasound for the management of adnexal masses and propose an approach to monitoring based on an understanding of the overall risk of cancer among the population in question and an assessment of how the potential benefit of monitoring compares with potential risk. In our approach, masses that are symptomatic, large (>10?cm), associated with an elevated CA 125 level or overt signs of malignancy, or that are determined to have a worrisome appearance by stringent ultrasound criteria should be evaluated surgically. Women with masses that have none of these characteristics should be offered monitoring. Short-term initial ultrasound monitoring carries significant potential benefit in terms of aiding detection of early malignancy and avoidance of unnecessary surgery. However, if a mass remains stable but persistent, the potential benefit of ongoing monitoring wanes with time, whereas the potential harms, in terms of patient anxiety, cost, and the risk of incidental findings and unnecessary surgery increase. Therefore, monitoring of stable lesions should be limited in duration in order to limit potential harms from overtreatment and overdiagnosis. Adherence Does Not Explain Black-White Differences in Cardiometabolic Risk Factor Control among Insured Patients with Diabetes Among patients with diabetes, racial differences in cardiometabolic risk factor control are common. The extent to which differences in medication adherence contribute to such disparities is not known. We examined whether medication adherence, controlling for treatment intensification, could explain differences in risk factor control between black and white patients with diabetes. We identified three cohorts of black and white patients treated with oral medications and who had poor risk factor control at baseline (2009): those with glycated >130 mm Hg (n?=?63,641). Subjects included insured adults with diabetes who were receiving care in one of nine U.S. integrated health systems comprising the SUrveillance, PREvention, and ManagEment of Diabetes Mellitus (SUPREME-DM) consortium. Baseline and follow-up risk factor control, sociodemographic, and clinical characteristics were obtained from electronic health records. Pharmacy-dispensing data were used to estimate medication adherence (i.e., medication refill adherence [MRA]) and treatment intensification (i.e., dose increase or addition of new medication class) between baseline and follow-up. County-level income and educational attainment were estimated via geocoding. Logistic regression models were used to test the association between race and follow-up risk factor control. Models were specified with and without medication adherence to evaluate its role as a mediator. We observed poorer medication adherence among black patients than white patients (p?0.01): 50.6 % of blacks versus 39.7 % of whites were not highly adherent (i.e., MRA <80 %) to HbA1c oral medication(s); 58.4 % of blacks and 46.7 % of whites were not highly adherent to lipid medication(s); and 33.4 % of blacks and 23.7 % of whites were not highly adherent to BP medication(s). Across all cardiometabolic risk factors, blacks were significantly less likely to achieve control (p?0.01): 41.5 % of blacks and 45.8 % of whites achieved HbA1c <8 %; 52.6 % of blacks and 60.8 % of whites achieved LDL-C <100; and 45.7 % of blacks and 53.6 % of whites achieved SBP <130. Adjusting for medication adherence/treatment intensification did not alter these patterns or model fit statistics. Medication adherence failed to explain observed racial differences in the achievement of HbA1c, LDL-C, and SBP control among Intern Med. 2016 Feb;31(2):188-95. Comparative Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Cataract Surgery Intracameral injection is an effective method for preventing infection, but no controlled study has been published in the United States. We conducted an observational, longitudinal cohort study to examine the effect of topical and injected antibiotics on risk of endophthalmitis. We identified 315 246 eligible cataract procedures in 204 515 members of Kaiser Permanente, California, 2005-2012. The study used information from the membership, medical, pharmacy, and surgical records from the electronic health record. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association of antibiotic prophylaxis (route and agent) with risk of endophthalmitis was estimated using logistic regression analysis. We confirmed 215 cases of endophthalmitis (0.07% or 0.7/1000). Posterior capsular rupture was associated 3.68-fold increased risk of endophthalmitis (CI, 1.89-7.20). Intracameral antibiotic was more effective than topical agent alone (OR, 0.58; CI, 0.38-0.91). Combining topical gatifloxacin or ofloxacin with intracameral agent was not more effective than using an intracameral agent alone (compared with intracameral only: intracameral plus 1.63; CI, 0.48-5.47). Compared with topical gatifloxacin, prophylaxis using topical aminoglycoside was ineffective (OR, 1.97; CI, 1.17-3.31). Surgical complication remains a key risk factor for endophthalmitis. Intracameral antibiotic was more effective for preventing post-cataract extraction endophthalmitis than topical antibiotic alone. Topical antibiotic was not shown to add to the effectiveness of an intracameral Effectiveness of Etanercept and Adalimumab in Patient Reported Outcomes and Injection-Related Tolerability To describe patient preferences in selecting specific biologics and compare clinical response using patient reported outcomes (PROs) among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) started on different anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies. Participants were enrollees in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Patients with RA who had at least two provider visits and started a new anti-TNF therapy from 10/2010-8/2011, were eligible for participation in this longitudinal study. Using a telephone survey, patient preferences in biologic selection and RAPID3, MDHAQ, and SF-12 scores were collected at baseline and at 6 months. Patient scores rating injection/infusion-site burning and stinging (ISBS) were collected at 6 months. In all, 267 patients with RA responded to the baseline survey, of whom 57% preferred an injectable biologic, 22% preferred an infused biologic, and 21% had no preference. Motivation for injectable biologics was convenience (92%) and for infusion therapy was dislike or lack of self-efficacy for self-injection (16%). After 6 months of treatment with anti-TNF, 70% of the 177 patients who answered the ISBS question reported ISBS with the last dose; on a scale of 1 (none) to 10 (worst), 41% of these reported a score of 2-5; and 29% reported a score of 6-10. Adalimumab users experienced 3.2 times (95% confidence interval 1.2-8.6) the level of ISBS that etanercept users experienced. There were no significant differences in RAPID3, MDHAQ, or SF-12 scores between etanercept or adalimumab initiators. Convenience and fear of self-injection were important considerations to patients selecting a biologic drug. Although more convenient, adalimumab associated with more ISBS than did etanercept, and this rate was higher than reported in clinical trials. At 6 months, PROs did not differ between etanercept and 2016;11(3):e0149781. Epub 2016-03-23. No Spillover Effect of the Foreclosure Crisis on Weight Change: The Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) The emerging body of research suggests the unprecedented increase in housing foreclosures and unemployment between 2007 and 2009 had detrimental effects on health. Using data from electronic health records of 105,919 patients with diabetes in Northern California, this study examined how increases in foreclosure rates from 2006 to 2010 affected weight change. We anticipated that two of the pathways that explain how the spike in foreclosure rates affects weight gain-increasing stress and declining salutary health behaviors- would be acute in a population with diabetes because of metabolic sensitivity to stressors and health behaviors. Controlling for unemployment, housing prices, temporal trends, and time-invariant confounders with individual fixed effects, we found no evidence of an association between the foreclosure rate in each patient's census block of residence and body mass index. Our results suggest, although more than half of the population was exposed to at least one foreclosure within their census block, the foreclosure crisis did not independently impact weight change. Authors: Downing J; Differences in Access to and Preferences for Using Patient Portals and Other eHealth Technologies Based on Race, Ethnicity, and Age: A Database and Survey Study of Seniors in a Large Health Plan Patients are being encouraged to go online to obtain health information and interact with their health care systems. However, a 2014 survey found that less than 60% of American adults aged 65 and older use the Internet, with much lower usage among black and Latino seniors compared with non-Hispanic white seniors, and among older versus younger seniors. Our aims were to (1) identify race/ethnic and age cohort disparities among seniors in use of the health plan's patient portal, (2) determine whether race/ethnic and age cohort disparities exist in access to digital devices and preferences for using email- and Web-based modalities to interact with the health care system, (3) assess whether observed disparities in preferences and patient portal use are due simply to barriers to access and inability to use the Internet, and (4) learn whether older adults not currently using the health plan's patient portal or website have a potential interest in doing so in the future and what kind of support might be best suited to help them. We conducted two studies of seniors aged 65-79 years. First, we used administrative data about patient portal account status and utilization in 2013 for a large cohort of English-speaking non-Hispanic white (n=183,565), black (n=16,898), Latino (n=12,409), Filipino (n=11,896), and Chinese (n=6314) members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health plan. Second, we used data from a mailed survey conducted in 2013-2014 with a stratified random sample of this population (final sample: 849 non-Hispanic white, 567 black, 653 Latino, 219 Filipino, and 314 Chinese). These data were used to examine race/ethnic and age disparities in patient portal use and readiness and preferences for using digital communication for health-related purposes. Adults aged 70-74 and 75-79 were significantly less likely than 65-69 year olds to be registered to use the patient portal, and among those registered, to have used the portal to send messages, view lab test results, or order prescription refills. Across all age groups, non-Hispanic whites and Chinese seniors were significantly more likely than black, Latino, and Filipino seniors to be registered and to have performed these actions. The survey found that black, Latino, and Filipino seniors and those 75 years old and older were significantly less likely to own digital devices (e.g., computers, smartphones), use the Internet and email, and be able and willing to use digital technology to perform health care-related tasks, including obtaining health information, than non-Hispanic whites, Chinese, and younger seniors (aged 65-69), respectively. The preference for using non-digital modalities persisted even among Internet users. Health plans, government agencies, and other organizations that serve diverse groups of seniors should include social determinants such as race/ethnicity and age when monitoring trends in eHealth to ensure that eHealth disparities do not induce greater health status and health care disparities between more privileged and less privileged groups.

User-Centered Design of a Tablet Waiting Room Tool for Complex Patients to Prioritize Discussion Topics for Primary Care Visits Complex patients with multiple chronic conditions often face significant challenges communicating and coordinating with their primary care physicians. These challenges are exacerbated by the limited time allotted to primary care visits. Our aim was to employ a user-centered design process to create a tablet tool for use by patients for visit discussion prioritization. We employed user-centered design methods to create a tablet-based waiting room tool that enables complex patients to identify and set discussion topic priorities for their primary care visit. In an iterative design process, we completed one-on-one interviews with 40 patients and their 17 primary care providers, followed by three design sessions with a 12-patient group. We audiorecorded and transcribed all discussions and categorized major themes. In addition, we met with 15 key health communication, education, and technology leaders within our health system to further review the design and plan for broader implementation of the tool. In this paper, we present the significant changes made to the tablet tool at each phase of this design work. Patient feedback emphasized the need to make the tablet tool accessible for patients who lacked technical proficiency and to reduce the quantity and complexity of text presentation. Both patients and their providers identified specific content choices based on their personal experiences (eg, the ability to raise private or sensitive concerns) and recommended targeting new patients. Stakeholder groups provided essential input on the need to augment text with video and to create different versions of the videos to match sex and race/ethnicity of the actors with patients. User-centered design in collaboration with patients, providers, and key health stakeholders led to marked evolution in the initial content, layout, and target audience for a tablet waiting room tool intended to assist complex patients with setting visit discussion Kaiser Permanente Northern California Adult Member Health Survey The Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Member Health Survey (MHS) is used to describe sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of the adult membership of this large, integrated health care delivery system to monitor trends over time, identify health disparities, and conduct research. To provide an overview of the KPNC MHS and share findings that illustrate how survey statistics and data have been and can be used for research and programmatic purposes. The MHS is a large-scale, institutional review board-approved survey of English-speaking KPNC adult members. The confidential survey has been conducted by mail triennially starting in 1993 with independent age-sex and geographically stratified random samples, with an option for online completion starting in 2005. The full survey sample and survey data are linkable at the individual level to Health Plan and geocoded data. Respondents are assigned weighting factors for their survey year and additional weighting factors for analysis of pooled survey data. Statistics from the 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, and 2011 surveys show trends in sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and access to the Internet and e-mail for the adult membership aged 25 to 79 years and for 6 age-sex subgroups. Pooled data from the 2008 and 2011 surveys show many significant differences in these characteristics across the 5 largest race/ethnic groups in KPNC (non-Hispanic whites, blacks, Latinos, Filipinos, and Chinese). The KPNC MHS has yielded unique insights and provides an opportunity for researchers and public health organizations outside of KPNC to leverage our survey-generated statistics and collaborate on epidemiologic and health services research studies.

Diagnostic Prevalence of Ankylosing Spondylitis Using Computerized Health Care Data, 1996 to 2009: Underrecognition in a US Health Care Setting Few studies have assessed the prevalence and features of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and ankylosing spondylitis in diverse, population-based, community settings. We used computerized diagnoses to estimate the prevalence of axSpA and ankylosing spondylitis in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). We identified persons aged 18 years or older with 1 or more International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis Code 720.X (ankylosing spondylitis and other inflammatory spondylopathies) in clinical encounter data from 1996 through 2009 to estimate the prevalence of axSpA and ankylosing spondylitis. We reviewed medical records to confirm the diagnosis in a random sample and estimated the positive predictive value of computerized data to identify confirmed cases using various case definitions. In the computerized data, 5568 adults had diagnostic codes indicating axSpA. On the basis of our case-finding approach using a single physician diagnosis code for ICD-9 720.X, the point prevalence of these conditions, standardized to the 2000 US Census, was 2.26 per 1000 persons for axSpA and 1.07 per 1000 for ankylosing spondylitis. Less than half of suspected cases saw a rheumatologist. The most specific algorithm for confirmed ankylosing spondylitis required 2 or more computerized diagnoses assigned by a rheumatologist, with 67% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 64%-69%) and 81% positive predictive value (95% confidence interval, 79%-83%). Observed prevalence in the KPNC population, compared with national estimates for axSpA and ankylosing spondylitis, suggests there is substantial underrecognition of these conditions in routine clinical practice. However, use of computerized data is able to identify true cases of ankylosing spondylitis, 2016-07-29. The Patient Outcomes Research To Advance Learning (PORTAL) Network Adult Overweight and Obesity Cohort: Development and Description The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) created a new national network infrastructure to enable large-scale observational comparative effectiveness research across diverse clinical care settings. As part of testing the feasibility of this effort, each clinical data research network (CDRN) was required to construct cohorts of patients, including one of patients with overweight and obesity. The aim of this paper is to report on the development of the Patient Outcomes Research to Advance Learning (PORTAL) overweight and obese cohort, which includes patients from 10 health plans located across the United States. Information was gathered from each plan's electronic health records (EHR). Eligibility included 18 years of age or older, a valid height and weight in 2012 or 2013, and body mass index (BMI) greater than 22.9 kg/m(2). Pre-diabetes and diabetes status was defined using the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria, using lab values of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or fasting glucose available in the EHR. Hypertension was identified from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes. Individuals were classified into BMI categories: healthy (>50.0 kg/m(2)). A cohort of 5,293,458 non-pregnant adults was created. Weight status was 20.39% (1,079,289/5,293,458) healthy weight, (1,817,438/5,293,458) met the definition of hypertension, 20.49% (1,660,940/5,293,458) of individuals met the criteria for pre-diabetes, and 14.98% (793,069/5,293,458) met criteria for diabetes. Prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes varied across health plans to a greater extent than expected based on hypertension prevalence and BMI status variability. This large, race, ethnic, and geographically diverse cohort will be useful for future studies of rare exposures or outcomes and differences in health care practices.

Treatment of Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome with Dexmedetomidine Studies suggest that dexmedetomidine-an intravenous central-acting ?2-adrenergic agonist that effectively reduces anxiety among critically ill patients-is being used in patients with severe alcohol withdrawal. However, evidence supporting its use is limited, and it is not approved for this indication. To assess the effect of dexmedetomidine on severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms and to compare its use with benzodiazepines alone. A retrospective, cohort study of 77 patients admitted to the adult medical intensive care unit with severe alcohol withdrawal between January 1, 2009, and October 31, 2013. The difference in lorazepam equivalents and Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol scores in the 24 hours before and after initiation of dexmedetomidine therapy. The frequency of dexmedetomidine use increased dramatically between 2009 and 2013 (16.7% vs 82.4%; p = 0.01). Initiation of dexmedetomidine therapy was associated with significant improvements in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol scores over corresponding 24-hour intervals (14.5 vs 8.5; p < 0.01). Benzodiazepine use also decreased, but the difference was not statistically significant at 24 hours (p = 0.10). Dexmedetomidine was well tolerated, requiring discontinuation of therapy in only 4 patients (10.5%). Dexmedetomidine use was also associated with significantly longer hospitalizations (p < 0.01). Dexmedetomidine initiation was associated with a reduction in short-term alcohol withdrawal symptoms in patients in the intensive care unit, with only a few patients experiencing adverse events. However, its use was also associated with longer hospitalizations. Further research is necessary to evaluate whether dexmedetomidine is efficacious or cost-effective in severe alcohol withdrawal. Consensus Statement on Electronic Health Predictive Analytics: A Guiding Framework to Address Challenges The recent explosion in available electronic health record (EHR) data is motivating a rapid expansion of electronic health care predictive analytic (e-HPA) applications, defined as the use of electronic algorithms that forecast clinical events in real time with the intent to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. There is an urgent need for a systematic framework to guide the development and application of e-HPA to ensure that the field develops in a scientifically sound, ethical, and efficient manner. Building upon earlier frameworks of model development and utilization, we identify the emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA, propose a framework that enables us to realize these opportunities, address these challenges, and motivate e-HPA stakeholders to both adopt and continuously refine the framework as the applications of e-HPA emerge. To achieve these objectives, 17 experts with diverse expertise including methodology, ethics, legal, regulation, and health care delivery systems were assembled to identify emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA and to propose a framework to guide the development and application of e-HPA. The framework proposed by the panel includes three key domains where e-HPA differs qualitatively from earlier generations of models and algorithms (Data Barriers, Transparency, and ETHICS) and areas where current frameworks are insufficient to address the emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA (Regulation and Certification; and Education and Training). The following list of recommendations summarizes the key points of the framework: Data Barriers: Establish mechanisms within the scientific community to support data sharing for predictive model development and testing.Transparency: Set standards around e-HPA validation based on principles of scientific transparency and reproducibility. Develop both individual-centered and society-centered risk-benefit approaches to evaluate e-HPA.Regulation and Certification: Construct a self-regulation and certification framework within e-HPA.Education and Training: Make significant changes to medical, nursing, and paraprofessional curricula by including training for understanding, evaluating, and utilizing predictive models.

Population Variations in Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment and Outcomes, Northern California, 1998-2009 To assess variations in rheumatoid arthritis treatment and outcomes at the community level from 1998 through 2009. The study used computerized data from 16 Kaiser Permanente Northern California Medical Centers. Mixed modeling was used to assess patterns across time and clinic. The analysis accounted for patient demographics, clustering of patients within Medical Centers, and repeated measures of patients over time. The metric used to measure drug use, months of use per patient per year, included both users and nonusers in the denominator, to account for both prevalence and duration of use. Assessment was performed of 28,601 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, with all levels of severity. From 1998 through 2009, methotrexate use doubled in the typical patient to include 23% of the time they were observed; sulfasalazine and hydrochloroquine use declined. By 2008 through 2009, leflunomide and antitumor necrosis factor agents were used by the typical patient 4% and 9% of the time, respectively. Between 1998 and 2009, disease-modifying antirheumatic drug use increased in the typical patient from 38% to 63% of the time, and oral prednisone use declined from 23% to 15% of the time, whereas opioid use initially rose but then fell to 23% of the time. No variations over time were observed for the rate of hospitalized pneumonia or opportunistic infection. Variation across clinics, measured by the difference in drug use between clinics at the 75th and 25th percentiles, was lowest for opioids (25% vs 20% of the time) and greatest for infliximab (< 1% to 3%). Increased use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and declines in prednisone are encouraging. need Winter;20(1):4-12. Epub 2015-12-21. Parental Views on Expanded Newborn Screening Using Whole-Genome Sequencing The potential application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to state-mandated standard newborn screening (NBS) challenges the traditional public health approach to NBS and raises ethical, policy, and clinical practice issues. This article examines the perspectives and values of diverse healthy pregnant women and parents of children diagnosed with a primary immunodeficiency disorder about traditional NBS and expanded NBS with the use of WGS. We conducted 4 focus groups (3 in English and 1 in Spanish) with socioeconomically and ethnically diverse pregnant women (n = 26), and a comparison group with parents of children diagnosed with a primary immunodeficiency disorder (n = 5). Pediatric policy-relevant themes that emerged from our analysis of the focus group data are presented within 4 categories: (1) perspectives on traditional NBS, (2) informed consent, (3) return of results, and (4) storage and retrieval of results. Analyses indicate that study participants desired greater inclusion in the NBS process. Despite an optimistic orientation to the potential benefits and limited harms likely to result from genomic applications of NBS, parents voiced concerns about privacy and control over test results. Limited trust in the medical system and the state-run NBS program informed these concerns. Expanded NBS with WGS for pediatricians may require management of more genetic conditions, including mutations that convey risk to both the child and parents for adult-onset disorders, and an informed-consent process to manage the genomic data and storage of blood spots. Attention to how these technologies are understood in diverse populations is needed for effective implementation. Authors: Joseph G; Chen F; Harris-Wai J; Pediatrics. 2016 Jan;137 Suppl 1:S36-46. Genetics, Diet, and Season Are Associated with Serum 25-Hydroxycholecalciferol Concentration in a Yup'ik Study Population from Southwestern Alaska. BACKGROUND:Low blood vitamin D concentration is a concern for people living in circumpolar regions, where sunlight is insufficient for vitamin D synthesis in winter months and the consumption of traditional dietary sources of vitamin D is decreasing.OBJECTIVE:The objective was to characterize the effects of diet, genetic variation, and season on serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D3] concentrations in Yup'ik Alaska Native people living in rural southwest Alaska.METHODS:This study was a cross-sectional design that assessed the associations of traditional diet (via a biomarker, the RBC (15)N value), age, gender, body mass index (BMI), community location, and genotype of select single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in (GC) with serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations in 743 Yup'ik male and female participants, aged 14-93 y, recruited between September 2009 and December 2013.RESULTS:Yup'ik participants, on average, had adequate concentrations of serum 25(OH)D3 (31.1 \u00b1 1.0 ng/mL). Variations in diet, BMI, age, gender, season of sample collection, and inland or coastal community geography were all significantly associated with serum 25(OH)D3 concentration. In models not adjusting for other covariates, age, diet, and seasonal effects explained 33.7%, 20.7%, and 9.8%, respectively, of variability in serum 25(OH)D3 Of the 8 SNPs interrogated in CYP2R1 and DHCR7, only rs11023374 in CYP2R1 significantly explaining of The GC haplotype explained an additional 2.8% of variability. Together, age, diet, gender, season of sample collection, BMI, geography of the community, and genotype at rs11023374 explained 52.5% of the variability in serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations.CONCLUSIONS:Lower consumption of the traditional diet was associated with lower serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3. Younger adults and youth in this community may be at increased risk of adverse outcomes associated with vitamin D insufficiency compared with older members of the community, especially during seasons of low sunlight exposure, because of lower consumption of dietary sources of vitamin D.

Patient-initiated e-mails to providers: associations with out-of-pocket visit costs, and impact on care-seeking and health To understand when patients use secure e-mail messaging with healthcare providers across several types of questions or concerns, associations between out-of-pocket costs for in-person visits and use of secure messaging, and to examine patient-reported impacts on care-seeking behavior and overall health. Cross-sectional survey of patients in an integrated healthcare delivery system, with access to a patient portal to send secure e-mail messages to providers at no out-of-pocket cost. The study included patients with a chronic condition (N = 1041). We described patient-reported preferences for contacting providers and patient-reported impact of e-mail use on phone calls, in-person visits, and overall health. We used multivariate analyses to examine patient characteristics associated with using e-mail as a first contact method, and effects on care-seeking and health. Overall, 56% of patients sent their provider an e-mail within 1 year, and 46% reported e-mail as their first method of contact for 1 or more types of medical concerns. After adjustment, higher out-of-pocket costs for in-person visits were significantly associated with choosing e-mail as a first method of contact (P < .05). Among patients who had e-mailed their provider, 42% reported that it reduced their phone contacts, 36% reduced in-person office visits and 32% reported e-mailing improved their overall health. Patients reported using e-mail broadly to initiate conversations with their providers, and patients with higher out-of-pocket costs for in-person visits were more likely to choose e-mail as a first contact method. Use of secure e-mails reduced patients' use of other types of healthcare and resulted in improved overall health. Authors: Reed M; Graetz I; Gordon N; Fung Manag Care. 2015 Dec 01;21(12):e632-9.

Emergency Department Management of Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter and Patient Quality of Life at One Month Postvisit We identify characteristics of patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter associated with favorable assessments of emergency department (ED) effectiveness and 30-day quality of life. As part of a prospective observational study of ED management and short-term outcomes of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or flutter, we adapted a disease-specific quality-of-life instrument. By telephone, we administered the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-life survey to patients 30 days after an ED visit in which they were treated for newly diagnosed or recent-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter and discharged home. We also asked respondents to rate the effectiveness of ED treatment. Using data prospectively collected in the ED and extracted from electronic health records, we recorded rhythm management (cardioversion attempts and type) and patient and ED treatment characteristics. Using multivariable regression, we examined the association between these characteristics and patient-reported effectiveness of ED treatment (\"very effective\" or not) and any atrial fibrillation or flutter quality-of-life effect. Six hundred fifty-two eligible ED patients (response rate 89%) treated between May 2011 and November 2012 completed follow-up. Of these patients, 454 (69.6%) reported that their ED treatment was \"very effective\" and 113 (17.3%) reported no quality-of-life influence. In multivariable analyses, there was an association between ED electrocardioversion and perceived ED effectiveness (P<.05) but none between treatment strategy and 30-day atrial fibrillation or flutter quality-of-life score. Respondents who were younger, women, and had worse pre-ED self-reported health (P<.05) were more likely to report a quality-of-life effect. In this observational study, ED rhythm management strategy was associated with greater perceived effectiveness of the ED visit but not with a difference in 30-day quality-of-life score.

Evaluating a Model to Predict Primary Care Physician-Defined Complexity in a Large Academic Primary Care Practice-Based Research Network Improving the ability to risk-stratify patients is critical for efficiently allocating resources within healthcare systems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a physician-defined complexity prediction model against outpatient Charlson score (OCS) and a commercial risk predictor (CRP). Using a cohort in which primary care physicians reviewed 4302 of their adult patients, we developed a predictive model for estimated physician-defined complexity (ePDC) and categorized our population using ePDC, OCS and CRP. 143,372 primary care patients in a practice-based research network participated in the study. For all patients categorized as complex in 2007 by one or more risk-stratification method, we calculated the percentage of total person time from 2008-2011 for which eligible cancer screening was incomplete, HbA1c was ? 9 %, and LDL was ? 130 mg/dl (in patients with cardiovascular disease). We also calculated the number of emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions per person year (ppy). There was modest agreement among individuals classified as complex using ePDC compared with OCS (36.7 %) and CRP (39.6 %). Over 4 follow-up years, eligible ePDC-complex patients had higher proportions (p?0.001) of time with: incomplete cervical (17.8 % vs. 13.3 % for OCS; 19.4 % vs. 11.2 % for CRP), breast (21.4 % vs. 14.9 % for OCS; 22.7 % vs. 15.0 % for CRP), and colon (25.9 % vs. 18.7 % for OCS; 27.0 % vs. 18.2 % for CRP) cancer screening; HbA1c???9 % (15.6 % vs. 8.1 % for OCS; 15.9 % vs. 6.9 % for CRP); and LDL???130 mg/dl (12.4 % vs. 7.9 % for OCS; 11.8 % vs 9.0 % for CRP). ePDC-complex patients had higher rates (p?0.003) of: ED visits (0.21 vs. 0.11 ppy for OCS; 0.17 vs. 0.15 ppy for CRP), and admissions in patients 45-64 and ? 65 years old (0.11 vs. 0.10 ppy AND 0.24 vs. 0.21 ppy for OCS). Our measure for estimated physician-defined complexity compared favorably to commonly used risk-prediction approaches in identifying future suboptimal quality and utilization outcomes.

Dietary and Behavioral Adjustments to Manage Bowel Dysfunction After Surgery in Long-Term Colorectal Cancer Survivors Bowel dysfunction is a known complication of colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery. Poor bowel control has a detrimental impact on survivors' health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This analysis describes the dietary and behavioral adjustments used by CRC survivors to manage bowel dysfunction and compares adjustments used by survivors with permanent ostomy to those with anastomosis. This mixed-methods analysis included pooled data from several studies that assessed HRQOL in CRC survivors. In all studies, CRC survivors with or without permanent ostomies (N = 856) were surveyed using the City of Hope Quality of Life Colorectal Cancer tool. Dietary adjustments were compared by ostomy status and by overall HRQOL score (high vs. low). Qualitative data from 13 focus groups and 30 interviews were analyzed to explore specific strategies used by survivors to manage bowel dysfunction. CRC survivors made substantial, permanent dietary, and behavioral adjustments after surgery, regardless of ostomy status. Survivors who took longer after surgery to become comfortable with their diet or regain their appetite were more likely to report worse HRQOL. Adjustments to control bowel function were divided into four major strategies: dietary adjustments, behavioral adjustments, exercise, and medication use. CRC survivors struggled with unpredictable bowel function and may fail to find a set of management strategies to achieve regularity. Understanding the myriad adjustments used by CRC survivors may lead to evidence-based interventions to foster positive adjustments after surgery and through long-term survivorship. 2015-07-10. Implementation of Computerized Physician Order Entry Is Associated With Increased Thrombolytic Administration for Emergency Department Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke Electronic health record systems with computerized physician order entry and condition-specific order sets are intended to standardize patient management and minimize errors of omission. However, the effect of these systems on disease-specific process measures and patient outcomes is not well established. We seek to evaluate the effect of computerized physician order entry electronic health record implementation on process measures and short-term health outcomes for patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke. We conducted a quasi-experimental cohort study of patients hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke with concurrent controls that took advantage of the staggered implementation of a comprehensive computerized physician order entry electronic health record across 16 medical centers within an integrated health care delivery system from 2007 to 2012. The study population included all patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency department (ED) for acute ischemic stroke, with an initial neuroimaging study within 2.5 hours of ED arrival. We evaluated the association between the availability of a computerized physician order entry electronic health record and the rates of ED intravenous tissue plasminogen activator administration, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and inhospital and 90-day mortality, using doubly robust estimation models to adjust for demographics, comorbidities, secular trends, and concurrent primary stroke center certification status at each center. Of 10,081 eligible patients, 6,686 (66.3%) were treated in centers after the computerized physician order entry electronic health record had been implemented. Computerized physician order entry was associated with significantly higher rates of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator administration (rate difference 3.4%; 95% confidence interval 0.8% to 6.0%) but not with significant rate differences in pneumonia or mortality. For patients hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke, computerized physician order entry use was associated with increased use of intravenous tissue plasminogen Dec;66(6):601-10. Epub 2015-09-08. Metabolic Dyslipidemia and Risk of Coronary Heart in 28,318 Adults With Diabetes Mellitus and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol <100 mg/dl The risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) in subjects with diabetes and \"metabolic dyslipidemia\" (high triglyceride [TGs] and low high-density cholesterol levels) remains a matter of concern. Little is known regarding the risk of CHD for this phenotype with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels <100 mg/dl. We analyzed a diabetes cohort of 28,318 members (aged 30 to 90 years) of Kaiser Permanente Northern California during 2002 to 2011 (192,356 person-years [p-y] follow-up), with LDL-C levels <100 mg/dl and without known CHD. We compared the incidence and hazard ratios (HRs) for CHD events in groups using Cox models: normal high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and TG (reference; n = 25.7%); normal HDL and high TG (? 150 mg/dl; n = 4,484,15.8%); low HDL (? 50 mg/dl for women and ? 40 mg/dl for men) and normal TG (n = 4,048, 14.3%); low HDL and high 44%). 19.0/1,000 p-y for women and men, respectively). After multivariate adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, hypertension, smoking, statin use, duration of diabetes, and hemoglobin A1c, we observed an increased CHD risk in women (HR 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.60) and men (HR 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.43 to 1.83) with metabolic dyslipidemia compared to those with normal HDL and TG. Even in subjects with an LDL-C <100 mg/dl, presence of metabolic dyslipidemia in adults with diabetes is associated with an increased risk of CHD. In conclusion, effective CHD prevention strategies are needed for adults with diabetes and metabolic Cardiol. Dec 1;116(11):1700-4. Epub 2015-09-10. Comparative Effectiveness of Three Prophylactic Strategies to Prevent Clinical Macular Edema after Phacoemulsification Surgery To study the relationship of chemoprophylaxis and other factors with the occurrence of acute, clinical, postoperative macular edema. Retrospective cohort study. The drug regimens consisted of postoperative topical prednisolone acetate (PA) alone or with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or intraoperative subconjunctival injection of 2 mg triamcinolone acetonide (TA) alone. Patients undergoing phacoemulsification at Kaiser Permanente, Diablo Service Area, Northern California, from 2007 through 2013. We identified incident macular edema diagnoses that had been recorded 5 to 120 days after phacoemulsification with visual acuity 20/40 or worse and evidence of macular thickening by optical coherence tomography. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from logistic regression analysis, conditioned on the surgeon and adjusted for year, patient age and race, diabetic retinopathy status, other ocular comorbidities, systemic comorbidities, and posterior capsular status. Incident rates of acute, clinical, postoperative macular edema. We confirmed 118 cases among 16 070 cataract surgeries (incidence, 0.73%). Compared with PA alone, the OR for the relationship of macular edema with PA+NSAID was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.21-0.95) and that for TA injection was 1.21 (95% CI, 0.48-3.06). The frequency of intraocular pressure spikes of 30 mmHg or more between postoperative days 16 and 45 was 0.6% in the topical PA group, 0.3% in the topical PA+NSAID group (P = 0.13), and 0.8% for the TA group (P = 0.52). Black race was associated with a risk of macular edema (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.41-5.79). Adding a prophylactic NSAID to PA treatment was associated with a reduced risk of macular edema with visual acuity of 20/40 or worse. The risk and safety of TA injection were similar to those of PA alone. Further research is needed on the prognostic significance of postoperative macular edema, the role of prophylaxis, the risk among black people, and the effectiveness of depot medications. Authors: Shorstein screening: a cost analysis Novel health information technology (IT)-based strategies harnessing patient registry data seek to improve care at a population level. We analyzed costs from a randomized trial of 2 health IT strategies to improve cancer screening compared with usual care from the perspective of a primary care network. Monte Carlo simulations were used to compare costs across management strategies. We assessed the cost of the software, materials, and personnel for baseline usual care (BUC) compared with augmented usual care (AUC [ie, automated patient outreach]) and augmented usual care with physician input (AUCPI [ie, outreach mediated by physicians' knowledge of their patient panels]) over 1 year. AUC and AUCPI each reduced the time physicians spent on cancer screening by 6.5 minutes per half-day clinical session compared with BUC without changing cancer screening rates. Assuming the value of this time accrues to the network, total costs of cancer screening efforts over the study year were $3.83 million for AUC, $3.88 million for AUCPI, and cost-saving BUC 87.1% AUCPI was cost-saving relative to BUC in 82.5% of simulations. Ongoing per patient costs were lower for both AUC ($35.63) and AUCPI ($35.58) relative to BUC ($39.51). Over the course of the study year, the value of reduced physician time devoted to preventive cancer screening outweighed the costs of the interventions. Primary care networks considering similar interventions will need to capture adequate physician time savings to offset the costs of expanding IT infrastructure.

The impact of electronic health records and teamwork on diabetes care quality Evidence of the impact electronic health records (EHRs) have on clinical outcomes remains mixed. The impact of EHRs likely depends on the organizational context in which they are used. This study focuses on one aspect of the organizational context: cohesion of primary care teams. We examined whether team cohesion among primary care team members changed the association between EHR use and changes in clinical outcomes for patients with diabetes. Retrospective longitudinal study. We combined provider-reported primary care team cohesion with lab values for patients with diabetes collected during the staggered EHR implementation (2005-2009). We used multivariate regression models with patient-level fixed effects to assess whether team cohesion levels changed the association between outpatient EHR use and clinical outcomes for patients with diabetes. Subjects were comprised of 80,611 patients with diabetes, in whom we measured changes in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). For A1C, EHR use was associated with an average decrease of 0.11% for patients with higher-cohesion primary care teams compared with a decrease of 0.08% for patients with lower-cohesion teams (difference = 0.02% in A1C; 95% CI, 0.01%-0.03%). For LDL-C, EHR use was associated with a decrease of 2.15 mg/dL for patients with higher-cohesion primary care teams compared with a decrease of 1.42 mg/dL for patients with lower-cohesion teams (difference = 0.73 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.41-1.11 mg/dL). Patients cared for by higher cohesion primary care teams experienced modest but statistically significantly greater EHR-related health outcome improvements, compared with patients cared for by providers practicing in lower cohesion teams.

Patient reported outcomes for diabetic peripheral neuropathy Multiple patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have been used to assess symptoms among patients with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN). However, there is little consistent application of measures in clinical or research settings. Our goal was to identify and compare patient reported outcome measures (PROs) specifically evaluated in neuropathy populations. Literature search, summary, and qualitative comparison of PROs validated in neuropathy populations. We identified 12 studies of PROs evaluated in neuropathy populations that included DPN patients. Two assessed sleep quality, 5 assessed painful symptoms, and 5 assessed quality of life. The number of items per measure ranged from one to 97, and the number of domains ranged from one to 18. All had adequate internal consistency (Chronbach's Alpha>0.70). There was mild to moderate standardization of domains across measures and only a few instruments used common comparators. The spectrum of DPN symptoms addressed included: sensory symptoms, autonomic symptoms, and function, beliefs, role participation, sleep quality, and perceptions of illness. There remains a need for a gold standard for DPN symptom assessment. Few existing instruments are adequately validated and the domains assessed are inconsistent. Current instrument selection should depend on the clinical and social context of the assessment. 2015-08-22. Variation in the Contents of Sepsis Bundles and Quality Measures: A Systematic Review Sepsis contributes to one in every two to three inpatient hospital deaths. Early recognition and treatment are instrumental in reducing mortality, yet there are substantial quality gaps. Sepsis bundles containing quality metrics are often used in efforts to improve outcomes. Several prominent organizations have published their own bundles, but there are few head-to-head comparisons of content. We sought to determine the degree of agreement on component elements of sepsis bundles and the associated timing goals for completion of each element. We additionally sought to evaluate the amount of variation between metrics associated with bundles. We reviewed the components of and level of agreement among several sepsis resuscitation and management bundles. We compared the individual bundle elements, together with their associated goals and metrics. We performed a systematic review (PubMed 2008-2015) and searched publically available online content, supplemented by interviews with key informants, to identify eight distinct bundles. Bundles are presented as current as of April 2015. Broadly, elements of care covered early resuscitation and short-term management. Bundles varied from 6 to 10 elements, and there were 12 distinct elements listed across all bundles. Only lactate collection and broad-spectrum antibiotics were common to all eight bundles, although there were seven elements included in at least 75% of the bundles. Timing goals for the collection of lactate and antibiotic administration varied among bundles from within 1 to 6 hours of diagnosis or admission. Notably, no bundle included metrics evaluating timeliness or completeness of sepsis recognition. There is a lack of consensus on component elements and timing goals across highly recognized sepsis bundles. These differences highlight an urgent need for comparative effectiveness research to guide future implementation and for metrics to evaluate progress. None of the widely instituted bundles include metrics to evaluate sepsis recognition or diagnostic accuracy.

A total of 360,036 surviving adults who experienced 609,393 overnight hospitalizations at 21 hospitals between June 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013. A composite outcome (nonelective rehospitalization and/or death within 7 or 30 days of discharge). Nonelective rehospitalization rates at 7 and 30 days were 5.8% and 12.4%; mortality rates were 1.3% and 3.7%; and composite outcome rates were 6.3% and 14.9%, respectively. Using data from a comprehensive EMR, we developed 4 models that can generate risk estimates for risk of the combined outcome within 7 or 30 days, either at the time of admission or at 8 AM on the day of discharge. The best was the 30-day discharge day model, which had a c-statistic of 0.756 (95% confidence interval, 0.754-0.756) of (0.171-0.178) in the validation dataset. The most important predictors-a composite acute physiology score and end of life care directives-accounted for 54% of the predictive ability of the 30-day model. Incorporation of diagnoses (not reliably available for real-time use) did not improve model performance.

Employer-Based Screening for Diabetes and Prediabetes in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System: A Natural Experiment for Translation in Diabetes (NEXT-D) Study This study evaluates an employer-based diabetes/prediabetes screening intervention that invited at-risk employees via letters, secure e-mails, and automated voice messages to complete blood glucose testing at a health plan facility. Quasi-experimental cohort study among health plan members insured by two employers that received the intervention and three employers that were selected as control sites. The proportion of at-risk members that completed a screening was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (36% vs 13%, P?0.001, adjusted for patient characteristics). Among those screened in the intervention group, the presence of obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco use were significant predictors of having a result that indicated diabetes or prediabetes (P?0.05, all comparisons). A low-intensity, employer-based intervention conducted in collaboration with a health care delivery system effectively increased screening for diabetes/prediabetes. Does well-child care have a future in pediatrics? The most common adult chronic diseases affect 1 in 3 adults and account for more than three-quarters of US health care spending. The major childhood drivers of adult disease are distinctly nonmedical: poverty, poor educational outcomes, unhealthy social and physical environments, and unhealthy lifestyle choices. Ideally, well-child care (WCC) would address these drivers and help create healthier adults with more productive lives and lower health care costs. For children without serious acute and chronic medical problems, however, traditional pediatric preventive services may be largely ineffective in addressing the outcomes that really matter; that is, improving lifelong health and reducing the burden of adult chronic disease. In this article, we examine what role WCC has in addressing the major childhood drivers of adult disease and consider various models for the future of WCC within pediatrics.

Implicit Racial/Ethnic Bias Among Health Care Professionals and Its Influence on Health Care Outcomes: A Systematic Review. BACKGROUND: In the United States, people of color face disparities in access to health care, the quality of care received, and health outcomes. The attitudes and behaviors of health care providers have been identified as one of many factors that contribute to health disparities. Implicit attitudes are thoughts and feelings that often exist outside of conscious awareness, and thus are difficult to consciously acknowledge and control. These attitudes are often automatically activated and can influence human behavior without conscious volition.OBJECTIVES: We investigated the extent to which implicit racial/ethnic bias exists among health care professionals and examined the relationships between health care professionals' implicit attitudes about racial/ethnic groups and health care outcomes.SEARCH METHODS: To identify relevant studies, we searched 10 computerized bibliographic databases and used a reference harvesting technique.SELECTION CRITERIA: We assessed eligibility using double independent screening based on a priori inclusion criteria. We included studies if they sampled existing health care providers or those in training to become health care providers, measured and reported results on implicit racial/ethnic bias, and were written in English.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We included a total of 15 studies for review and then subjected them to double independent data extraction. Information extracted included the citation, purpose of the study, use of theory, study design, study site and location, sampling strategy, response rate, sample size and characteristics, measurement of relevant variables, analyses performed, and results and findings. We summarized study design characteristics, and categorized and then synthesized substantive findings.MAIN RESULTS: Almost all studies used cross-sectional designs, convenience sampling, US participants, and the Implicit Association Test to assess implicit bias. Low to moderate levels of implicit racial/ethnic bias were found among health care professionals in all but 1 study. These implicit bias scores are similar to those in the general population. Levels of implicit bias against Black, Hispanic/Latino/Latina, and dark-skinned people were relatively similar across these groups. Although some associations between implicit bias and health care outcomes were nonsignificant, results also showed that implicit bias was significantly related to patient-provider interactions, treatment decisions, treatment adherence, and patient health outcomes. Implicit attitudes were more often significantly related to patient-provider interactions and health outcomes than treatment processes.CONCLUSIONS: Most health care providers appear to have implicit bias in terms of positive attitudes toward Whites and negative attitudes toward people of color. Future studies need to employ more rigorous methods to examine the relationships between implicit bias and health care outcomes. Interventions targeting implicit attitudes among health care professionals are needed because implicit bias may contribute to health disparities for people of color.

Potential harms outweigh benefits of indefinite monitoring of stable adnexal masses The management of women with asymptomatic adnexal masses should aim to balance potential benefit with potential harm. While masses with highly worrisome features or other signs of malignancy should be referred for surgery, the vast majority of masses have an indeterminate or benign appearance and are candidates for observation. Evidence supports the use of initial short-term serial ultrasound in distinguishing between benign and malignant masses. However, benefit from prolonged, potentially life-long monitoring of stable masses has not been demonstrated. Since the goal of monitoring an adnexal mass is to observe for worrisome growth or increasing complexity as an indicator of malignancy, if the mass remains stable, the likelihood of malignancy and therefore, the potential benefit of observation wanes with time. The recognition that Type 2 high grade serous cancers, which are responsible for the majority of deaths from ovarian cancer, arise from fallopian tube rather than ovarian precursors, further diminishes the likelihood that monitoring a stable ovarian mass will lead to early diagnosis of high grade disease. While some Type 1 cancers may develop from ovarian precursors, the available data suggest that any measurable benefit of monitoring known lesions for detection of these cancers is realized within the first year of observation. The argument in favor of indefinite, potentially life-long monitoring of stable masses also fails to adequately account for the risks of perpetual imaging, which include the risk of incidental findings, an increased likelihood of unnecessary surgery, patient anxiety and cost. It is not always better to order a test than not order a test. Given the absence of evidence of benefit, observation of stable small adnexal masses should be limited in duration in order to minimize potential harms.

Lessons From the SUPREME-DM Cohort Study Examining trends in cardiovascular events and mortality in US health systems can guide the design of targeted clinical and public health strategies to reduce cardiovascular events and mortality rates. We conducted an observational cohort study from 2005 to 2011 among 1.25 million diabetic subjects and 1.25 million nondiabetic subjects from 11 health systems that participate in the Surveillance, Prevention and Management of Diabetes Mellitus (SUPREME-DM) DataLink. Annual rates (per 1000 person-years) of myocardial coronary syndrome (International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision, 410.0-410.91, 411.1-411.8), stroke (International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision, 430-432.9, 433-434.9), heart failure (International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision, 428-428.9), and all-cause mortality were monitored by diabetes mellitus (DM) status, age, sex, race/ethnicity, and a prior cardiovascular history. We observed significant declines in cardiovascular events and mortality rates in subjects with and without DM. However, there was substantial variation by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and prior cardiovascular history. Mortality declined from 44.7 to 27.1 (P<0.0001) for those with DM and cardiovascular disease (CVD), from 11.2 to 10.9 (P=0.03) for those with DM only, and from 18.9 to 13.0 (P<0.0001) for those with CVD only. Yet, in the [almost equal to]85% of subjects with neither DM nor CVD, overall mortality (7.0 to 6.8; P=0.10) and stroke rates (1.6-1.6; P=0.77) did not decline and heart failure rates increased (0.9-1.15; P=0.0005). To sustain improvements in myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and mortality, health systems that have successfully focused on care improvement in high-risk adults with DM or CVD must broaden their improvement strategies to target lower risk adults who have not yet developed DM or CVD.

An algorithm to identify medication nonpersistence using electronic pharmacy databases Identifying patients who are medication nonpersistent (fail to refill in a timely manner) is important for healthcare operations and research. However, consistent methods to detect nonpersistence using electronic pharmacy records are presently lacking. We developed and validated a nonpersistence algorithm for chronically used medications. Refill patterns of adult diabetes patients (n?=?14,349) prescribed cardiometabolic therapies were studied. We evaluated various grace periods (30-300 days) to identify medication nonpersistence, which is defined as a gap between refills that exceeds a threshold equal to the last days' supply dispensed plus a grace period plus days of stockpiled medication. Since data on medication stockpiles are typically unavailable for ongoing users, we compared nonpersistence to rates calculated using algorithms that ignored stockpiles. When using grace periods equal to or greater than the number of days' supply dispensed (i.e., at least 100 days), this novel algorithm for medication nonpersistence gave consistent results whether or not it accounted for days of stockpiled medication. The agreement (Kappa coefficients) between nonpersistence rates using algorithms with versus without stockpiling improved with longer grace periods and ranged from 0.63 (for 30 days) to 0.98 (for a 300-day grace period). Our method has utility for health care operations and research in prevalent (ongoing) and new user cohorts. The algorithm detects a subset of patients with inadequate medication-taking behavior not identified as primary nonadherent or secondary nonadherent. Healthcare systems can most comprehensively identify patients with short- or long-term medication underutilization by identifying primary nonadherence, secondary Assoc. 2015 Sep;22(5):957-61.

Changes in physical activity among adults with diabetes: a longitudinal cohort study of inactive patients with Type 2 diabetes who become physically active To identify the predictors and clinical effects among inactive patients with diabetes who become physically active, in the setting of a large integrated health system. We studied adults with Type 2 diabetes with at least two clinic visits between December 2011 and November 2012 who reported being inactive at their first visit. The mean (\u00b1sd) interval between their first and last visit was 6.2 (\u00b12.3) months. We analysed self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity data collected using a structured intake form during routine clinical care. The study cohort (N = 6853) had a mean age of 60.2 years; 51.4% were women and 53.6% were non-white. n = 4280) reported remaining physically inactive, while 16.0% reported achieving the recommended moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels (? 150 min/week) by the last visit of the study period. Female gender (odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.67, 35 kg/m(2) : odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.42, 0.70), chronic kidney disease (odds ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.65, 0.94) and depression (odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.62, 0.96) were each independently associated with not achieving the recommended moderate-to-vigorous physical activity level, while physician referral to lifestyle education was a positive predictor (odds ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.09, 1.85). Controlling for baseline differences, patients achieving the recommended moderate-to-vigorous physical activity target lost 1.0 kg more weight compared with patients remaining inactive (P < 0.001). Patients with diabetes in a real-world clinical setting lost weight after becoming physically active; however, nearly two-thirds of patients remained inactive. Novel interventions to address physical inactivity in primary care should address barriers faced by older patients with medically complex disease. Ethnic Differences in Geriatric Conditions and Diabetes Complications Among Older, Insured Adults With Diabetes: The Diabetes and Aging Study The aim of this study was to evaluate ethnic differences in burden of prevalent geriatric conditions and diabetic complications among older, insured adults with diabetes. An observational study was conducted among 115,538 diabetes patients, aged \u00b360, in an integrated health care system with uniform access to care. Compared with Whites, Asians and Filipinos were more likely to be underweight but had substantively lower prevalence of falls, urinary incontinence, polypharmacy, depression, and chronic pain, and were least likely of all groups to have at least one geriatric condition. African Americans had significantly lower prevalence of incontinence and falls, but higher prevalence of dementia; Latinos had a lower prevalence of falls. Except for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), Whites tended to have the highest rates of prevalent diabetic complications. Among these insured older adults, ethnic health patterns varied substantially; differences were frequently small and rates were often better among select minority groups, suggesting progress toward the Healthy People 2020 objective to reduce health disparities.

Reach and Validity of an Objective Medication Adherence Measure Among Safety Net Health Plan Members with Diabetes: A Cross-Sectional Study With the expansion of Medicaid and low-cost health insurance plans among diverse patient populations, objective measures of medication adherence using pharmacy claims could advance clinical care and translational research for safety net care.

To evaluate the performance of continuous medication gap (CMG) for diverse, low-income managed care members with diabetes. We conducted this cross-sectional analysis using administrative and clinical data for 680 members eligible for a self-management support trial at a nonprofit, government-sponsored managed care plan. We applied CMG methodology to cardiometabolic medication claims for English- , Cantonese- , or Spanish-speaking members with diabetes. We inclusiveness (the proportion with calculable CMG) and selectivity (sociodemographic and medical differences from members without CMG). For validity, we examined unadjusted associations of suboptimal adherence (CMG?> ?20%) with suboptimal cardiometabolic control. 429 members (63%) had calculable CMG. Compared with members without CMG, members with CMG were younger, more likely employed, and had poorer glycemic control but had better blood pressure and lipid control. Suboptimal adherence occurred more frequently among members with poor cardiometabolic control than among members with optimal control (28% vs. 12%, P?=?0.02). CMG demonstrated acceptable inclusiveness and validity in a diverse, low-income safety net population, comparable with its performance in studies among other insured populations. CMG may provide a useful tool to measure adherence among increasingly diverse Medicaid populations, complemented by other strategies to reach those not captured by 2015 Aug;21(8):688-98. Why the C-statistic is not informative to evaluate early warning scores and what metrics to use Metrics typically used to report the performance of an early warning score (EWS), such as the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve or C-statistic, are not useful for pre-implementation analyses. Because physiological deterioration has an extremely low prevalence of 0.02 per patient-day, these metrics can be misleading. We discuss the statistical reasoning behind this statement and present a novel alternative metric more adequate to operationalize an EWS. We suggest that pre-implementation evaluation of EWSs should include at least two metrics: sensitivity; and either the positive predictive value, number needed to evaluate, or estimated rate of alerts. We also argue the importance of reporting each individual cutoff value. Authors: Romero-Brufau Variation in genes controlling warfarin disposition and response in American Indian and Alaska Native people: CYP2C9, VKORC1, CYP4F2, CYP4F11, GGCX. OBJECTIVES:Pharmacogenetic testing is projected to improve health outcomes and reduce the cost of care by increasing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing drug toxicity. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people historically have been excluded from pharmacogenetic research and its potential benefits, a deficiency we sought to address. The vitamin K antagonist warfarin is prescribed for prevention of thromboembolic events, although its narrow therapeutic index and wide interindividual variability necessitate close monitoring of drug response. Therefore, we were interested in variation in CYP2C9, VKORC1, CYP4F2, CYP4F11, and GGCX, which encode enzymes important for the activity of warfarin and synthesis of vitamin K-dependent blood clotting factors.METHODS:We resequenced these genes in 188 AI/AN people in partnership with Southcentral Foundation in Anchorage, Alaska and 94 Yup'ik people living in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of southwest Alaska to identify known or novel function-disrupting variation. We conducted genotyping for specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in larger cohorts of each study population (380 and 350, respectively).RESULTS:We identified high frequencies of the lower-warfarin dose VKORC1 haplotype (-1639G>A and 1173C>T) and the higher-warfarin dose CYP4F2*3 variant. We also identified two relatively common, novel, and potentially function-disrupting variants in CYP2C9 (M1L and N218I), which, along with CYP2C9*3, CYP2C9*2, and CYP2C9*29, predict that a significant proportion of AI/AN people will have decreased CYP2C9 activity.CONCLUSION:Overall, we predict a lower average warfarin dose requirement in AI/AN populations in Alaska than that seen in non-AI/AN populations of the USA, a finding consistent with clinical experience in Alaska.

Building Equity Improvement into Quality Improvement: Reducing Socioeconomic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Screening as Part of Population Health Management Improving colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates for patients from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds is a recognized public health priority. Our aim was to determine if implementation of a system-wide screening intervention could reduce disparities in the setting of improved overall screening rates. This was an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis before and after a population management intervention. Patients eligible for CRC screening (age 52-75 years without prior total colectomy) in an 18-practice research network from 15 June 2009 to 15 June 2012 participated in the study. The Technology for Optimizing Population Care (TopCare) intervention electronically identified patients overdue for screening and facilitated contact by letter or telephone scheduler, with or without physician involvement. Patients identified by algorithm as high risk for non-completion entered into intensive patient navigation. Patients were dichotomized as???high school diploma (? HS), an indicator of socioeconomic disadvantage, vs. >HS diploma (> HS). The monthly disparity between???HS and?>?HS with regard to CRC screening completion was examined. At baseline, 72% of 47,447 eligible patients had completed screening, compared with 75% of 51,442 eligible patients at the end of follow-up (p?0.001). CRC screening completion was lower in???HS vs. >HS patients in June 2009 (65.7% vs. 74.5%, p?0.001) and remained lower in June 2012 (69.4% vs. 76.7%, p?0.001). In the ITS analysis, which accounts for secular trends, TopCare was associated with a significant decrease in the CRC screening disparity (0.7%, p?0.001). The effect of TopCare represents approximately 99 additional???HS patients screened above prevailing trends, or 26 life-years gained had these patients remained unscreened. A multifaceted population management intervention sensitive to the needs of vulnerable patients modestly narrowed disparities in CRC screening, while also increasing overall screening rates. Embedding interventions for vulnerable patients within larger population management systems represents an effective approach to increasing overall quality of care while also decreasing disparities.

Prevalence of chronic kidney disease among individuals with diabetes in the SUPREME-DM Project, 2005-2011 Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Different methods of CKD ascertainment may impact prevalence estimates. We used data from 11 integrated health systems in the United States to estimate CKD prevalence in adults with diabetes (2005-2011), and compare the effect of different ascertainment methods on prevalence estimates. We used the SUPREME-DM DataLink (n = 879,312) to estimate annual CKD prevalence. Methods of CKD ascertainment included: diagnosis codes alone, impaired estimated glomerular (eGFR) alone (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), alone (spot urine albumin creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g or equivalent), and combinations of these approaches. CKD prevalence was 20.0% using diagnosis codes, 17.7% using impaired eGFR, 11.9% using albuminuria, and 32.7% when one or more method suggested CKD. The criteria had poor concordance. After age- and sex-standardization to the 2010 U.S. Census population, prevalence using diagnosis codes increased from 10.7% in 2005 to 14.3% in 2011 (P < 0.001). The prevalence using eGFR decreased from 9.7% in 2005 to 8.6% in 2011 (P < 0.001). Our data indicate that CKD prevalence and prevalence trends differ according to the CKD ascertainment method, highlighting the necessity for multiple sources of data to accurately estimate and track CKD prevalence.

Outreach to diversify clinical trial participation: A randomized recruitment study Racial and ethnic minorities remain underrepresented in clinical research, yet few recruitment strategies have been rigorously evaluated. We experimentally tested whether targeted recruitment letters acknowledging diabetes health disparities and health risks specific to recipients' racial/ethnic group improved two metrics of trial participation: willingness to be screened and enrollment. This experiment was efficiently nested within a randomized clinical trial examining a preventive lifestyle intervention among women at high risk for diabetes. Pregnant women with gestational diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (N?=?445) were randomized to receive a targeted recruitment letter with health risk information specific to their racial/ethnic group (n?=?216), or a standard letter with risk information for the general population (n?=?229). All letters were bilingual in English and Spanish. The targeted as compared to the standard letter did not improve screening or enrollment rates overall or within separate racial/ethnic groups. Among Latina women who preferred Spanish, the targeted letter showed trends for improved screening (66.7% vs 33.3%, p?=?.06) and enrollment rates (38.9% vs 13.3%, p?=?.13). In contrast, among Latina women who preferred English, the targeted letter significantly lowered screening (29.6% vs 57.1%, p?=?.04) and showed trends for lowered enrollment rates (25.9% vs 50.0%, p?=?.07). Results from this randomized study appear to suggest that recruitment letters with diabetes health risk information targeted to recipients' race/ethnicity may improve one metric of clinical trial participation among Latina women who prefer Spanish, but not English. Larger experimental studies, incorporating input from diverse participant stakeholders, are needed to develop evidence-based minority recruitment strategies. Evaluating diabetes health policies using natural experiments: the natural experiments for translation in diabetes study The high prevalence and costs of type 2 diabetes makes it a rapidly evolving focus of policy action. Health systems, employers, community organizations, and public agencies have increasingly looked to translate the benefits of promising research interventions into innovative policies intended to prevent or control diabetes. Though guided by research, these health policies provide no guarantee of effectiveness and may have opportunity costs or unintended consequences. Natural experiments use pragmatic and available data sources to compare specific policies to other policy alternatives or predictions of what would likely have happened in the absence of any intervention. The Natural Experiments for Translation in Diabetes (NEXT-D) Study is a network of academic, community, industry, and policy partners, collaborating to advance the methods and practice of natural experimental research, with a shared aim of identifying and prioritizing the best policies to prevent and control diabetes. This manuscript describes the NEXT-D Study group's multi-sector natural experiments in areas of diabetes prevention or control as case examples to illustrate the selection, design, analysis, and challenges inherent to natural experimental study approaches to inform development or evaluation of health Am J Prev Med. 2015 Jun;48(6):747-54. Methods for engaging stakeholders in comparative effectiveness research: A patient-centered approach to improving diabetes care Engaging stakeholders in the research process has the potential to improve quality of care and the patient care experience. Online patient community surveys can elicit important topic areas for comparative effectiveness research. Stakeholder meetings with substantial patient representation, as well as representation from health care delivery systems and research funding agencies, are a valuable tool for selecting and refining pilot research and quality improvement projects. Giving patient stakeholders a deciding vote in selecting pilot research topics helps ensure their 'voice' is heard. Researchers and health care leaders should continue to develop best-practices and strategies for increasing patient involvement in comparative effectiveness and delivery science research. Authors: Schmittdiel JA; Records and the Evolution of Diabetes Care: A Narrative Review Adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has increased dramatically since the 2009 implementation of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that the majority of U.S. hospitals and nearly half of U.S. health care professionals have implemented an EHR with advanced functionality.(1) The goals of the HITECH act were not only to incentivize the adoption of EHRs, but also to increase the quality, safety, and efficiency of health care by promoting the concept of \"meaningful use.\"(2,3) The stepwise implementation of \"meaningful use\" is now entering the latter stages with a focus on improving patient outcomes.(4).

Impact of Relative Contraindications to Home Management in Emergency Department Patients with Low-Risk Pulmonary Embolism Studies of adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) suggest that those who are low risk on the PE Severity Index (classes I and II) can be managed safely without hospitalization. However, the impact of relative contraindications to home management on outcomes has not been described. To compare 5-day and 30-day adverse event rates among low-risk ED patients with acute PE without and with outpatient ineligibility criteria. We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study of adults presenting to the ED with acute low-risk PE between 2010 and 2012. We evaluated the association between outpatient treatment eligibility criteria based on a comprehensive list of relative contraindications and 5-day adverse events and 30-day outcomes, including major hemorrhage, recurrent venous thromboembolism, and all-cause mortality. Of 423 adults with acute low-risk PE, 271 (64.1%) had no relative contraindications to outpatient treatment (outpatient eligible), whereas 152 (35.9%) had at least one contraindication (outpatient ineligible). Relative contraindications were categorized as no 5-day events in the outpatient-eligible group (95% upper confidence limit, 1.7%) and two events (1.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1-5.0%) in the outpatient-ineligible group (P?=?0.13). At 30 days, there were five events (two recurrent venous thromboemboli and three major bleeding events) in the outpatient-eligible group (1.8%; 95% CI, 0.7-4.4%) compared with nine in the ineligible group (5.9%; 95% CI, 2.7-10.9%; P?0.05). This difference remained significant when controlling for PE severity class. Nearly two-thirds of adults presenting to the ED with low-risk PE were potentially eligible for outpatient therapy. Relative contraindications to outpatient management were associated with an increased frequency of adverse events at 30 days among adults with low-risk PE.

Randomized Trial of a Health IT Tool to Support Between-Visit-Based Laboratory Monitoring for Chronic Disease Medication Prescriptions Lack of timely medication intensification and inadequate medication safety monitoring are two prevalent and potentially modifiable barriers to effective and safe chronic care. Innovative applications of health information technology tools may help support chronic disease management. To examine the clinical impact of a novel health IT tool designed to facilitate between-visit ordering and tracking of future laboratory testing. Clinical trial randomized at the provider level (n = 44 primary care physicians); patient-level outcomes among 3,655 primary care patients prescribed 5,454 oral medicines for hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and/or hypertension management over a 12-month period. Time from prescription to corresponding follow-up laboratory testing; proportion of follow-up time that patients achieved corresponding risk factor control (A1c, LDL); adverse event laboratory monitoring 4 weeks after medicine prescription. Patients whose physicians were allocated to the intervention (n = 1,143) had earlier LDL laboratory assessment compared to similar patients (n = 703) of control physicians [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.15 (1.01-1.32), p = 0.04]. Among patients with elevated LDL (486 intervention, 324 control), there was decreased time to LDL goal in the intervention group [aHR 1.26 (0.99-1.62)]. However, overall there were no significant differences between study arms in time spent at LDL or HbA1c goal. Follow-up safety monitoring (e.g., creatinine, potassium, or transaminases) was relatively infrequent (ranging from 7 % to 29 % at 4 weeks) and not statistically different between arms. Intervention physicians indicated that lack of reimbursement for non-visit-based care was a barrier to use of the tool. A health IT tool to support between-visit laboratory monitoring improved the LDL testing interval but not LDL or HbA1c control, and it did not alter safety monitoring. Adoption of innovative tools to support physicians in non-visit-based chronic disease management may be limited by current visit-based financial and productivity incentives.

Does Food Vendor Density Mediate the Association Between Neighborhood Deprivation and BMI?: A G-computation Mediation Analysis In previous research, neighborhood deprivation was positively associated with body mass index (BMI) among adults with diabetes. We assessed whether the association between neighborhood deprivation and BMI is attributable, in part, to geographic variation in the availability of healthful and unhealthful food vendors. Subjects were 16,634 participants of the Diabetes Study of Northern California, a multiethnic cohort of adults living with diabetes. Neighborhood deprivation and healthful (supermarket and produce) and unhealthful (fast food outlets and convenience stores) food vendor kernel density were calculated at each participant's residential block centroid. We estimated the total effect, controlled direct effect, natural direct effect, and natural indirect effect of neighborhood deprivation on BMI. Mediation effects were estimated using G-computation, a maximum likelihood substitution estimator of the G-formula that allows for complex data relations such as multiple mediators and sequential causal pathways. We estimated that if neighborhood deprivation was reduced from the most deprived to the least deprived quartile, average BMI would change by -0.73 units (95% confidence interval: -1.05, -0.32); however, we did not detect evidence of mediation by food vendor density. In contrast to previous findings, a simulated reduction in neighborhood deprivation from the most deprived to the least deprived quartile was associated with dramatic declines in both healthful and unhealthful food vendor density. Availability of food vendors, both healthful and unhealthful, did not appear to explain the association between neighborhood deprivation and BMI in this population of adults with diabetes.

Preventable Major Cardiovascular Events Associated With Uncontrolled Glucose, Blood Pressure, and Lipids and Active Smoking in Adults With Diabetes With and Without Cardiovascular Disease: A Contemporary Analysis The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of major cardiovascular (CV) hospitalization events and all-cause deaths among adults with diabetes with or without CV disease (CVD) associated with inadequately controlled glycated hemoglobin (A1C), high LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), high blood pressure (BP), and current smoking. Study subjects included 859,617 adults with diabetes enrolled for more than 6 months during 2005-2011 in a network of 11 U.S. integrated health care organizations. Inadequate risk factor control was classified as LDL-C ?100 mg/dL, A1C ?7% (53 mmol/mol), BP ?140/90 mm Hg, or smoking. Major CV events were based on primary hospital discharge diagnoses for myocardial infarction (MI) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stroke, or heart failure (HF). Five-year incidence rates, rate ratios, and average attributable fractions were estimated using multivariable Poisson regression models. Mean (SD) age at baseline was 59 (14) years; 48% of subjects were female, 45% were white, and 31% had CVD. Mean follow-up was 59 months. Event rates per 100 person-years for adults with diabetes and CVD versus those without CVD were 6.0 vs. 1.7 for MI/ACS, 5.3 vs. 1.5 for stroke, 8.4 vs. 1.2 for HF, 18.1 vs. 40 for all CV events, and 23.5 vs. 5.0 for all-cause mortality. The percentages of CV events and deaths associated with inadequate risk factor control were 11% and 3%, respectively, for those with CVD and 34% and 7%, respectively, for those without CVD. Additional attention to traditional CV risk factors could yield further substantive reductions in CV events and mortality in adults with diabetes.

Determinants of Adherence to Diabetes Medications: Findings From a Large Pharmacy Claims Database Adults with diabetes typically take multiple medications for hyperglycemia, diabetes-associated conditions, and other comorbidities. Medication adherence is associated with improved outcomes, including reduced health care costs, hospitalization, and mortality. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a large pharmacy claims database to examine patient, medication, and prescriber factors associated with adherence to antidiabetic medications. We extracted data on a cohort of >200,000 patients who were treated for diabetes with noninsulin medications in the second half of 2010 and had continuous prescription benefits eligibility through 2011. Adherence was defined as a medication possession ratio ? 0.8. We used a modified adherence measure that accounted for switching therapies. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors independently associated with adherence. Sixty-nine percent of patients were adherent. Adherence was independently associated with older age, male sex, higher education, higher income, use of mail order versus retail pharmacies, primary care versus nonendocrinology specialist prescribers, higher daily total pill burden, and lower out-of-pocket costs. Patients who were new to diabetes therapy were significantly less likely to be adherent. Several demographic, clinical, and potentially modifiable system-level factors were associated with adherence to antidiabetic medications. Patients typically perceived to be healthy (those who are younger, new to diabetes, and on few other medications) may be at risk for nonadherence. For all patients, efforts to reduce out-of-pocket costs and encourage use of mail order pharmacies may result in higher adherence. Epub 2015-01-08. Health Care System-level Factors Associated With Performance on Medicare STAR Adherence Metrics in a Large, Integrated Delivery System The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provide significant incentives to health plans that score well on Medicare STAR metrics for cardiovascular disease risk factor medication adherence. Information on modifiable health system-level predictors of adherence can help clinicians and health plans develop strategies for improving Medicare STAR scores, and potentially improve cardiovascular disease outcomes. To examine the association of Medicare STAR adherence metrics with system-level factors. A cross-sectional study. A total of 129,040 diabetes patients aged 65 years and above in 2010 from 3 Kaiser Permanente regions. Adherence to antihypertensive, antihyperlipidemic, and oral antihyperglycemic medications in 2010, defined by Medicare STAR as the proportion of days covered ? 80%. After controlling for individual-level factors, the strongest predictor of achieving STAR-defined medication adherence was a mean prescribed medication days' supply of > 90 days (RR=1.61 for antihypertensives, oral antihyperglycemics, and statins; all P < 0.001). Using mail order pharmacy to fill medications > 50% of the time was independently associated with better adherence with these medications (RR = 1.07, 1.06, 1.07; P < 0.001); mail order use had an increased positive association among black and Hispanic patients. Medication copayments ? $10 for 30 days' supply (RR = 1.02, 1.02, 1.02; P < 0.01) and annual individual out-of-pocket maximums ? $2000 (RR = 1.02, 1.01, 1.02; P < 0.01) were also significantly associated with higher adherence for all 3 therapeutic groupings. Greater medication days' supply and mail order pharmacy use, and lower copayments and out-of-pocket maximums, are associated with better Medicare STAR adherence. Initiatives to improve adherence should focus on modifiable health system-level barriers to obtaining Med Care. 2015 Apr;53(4):332-7. Impact of a Pharmacy Benefit Change on New Use of Mail Order Pharmacy among Diabetes Patients: The Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) To assess the impact of a pharmacy benefit change on mail order pharmacy (MOP) uptake. Race-stratified, random sample of diabetes patients in an integrated health care delivery system. In this natural experiment, we studied the impact of a pharmacy benefit change that conditionally discounted medications if patients used MOP and prepaid two copayments. We compared MOP uptake among those exposed to the benefit change (n = 2,442) and the reference group with no benefit change (n = 8,148), and estimated differential MOP uptake across social strata using a difference-in-differences framework. Ascertained MOP uptake (initiation among previous nonusers). Thirty percent of patients started using MOP after receiving the benefit change versus 9 percent uptake among the reference group (p < .0001). After adjustment, there was a 26 percentage point greater MOP uptake (benefit change effect). This benefit change effect was significantly smaller among patients with inadequate health literacy (15 percent less), limited English proficiency (14 percent less), and among Latinos and Asians (24 and 16 percent less compared to Caucasians). Conditionally discounting medications delivered by MOP effectively stimulated MOP uptake overall, but it unintentionally widened previously existing social gaps in MOP use because it stimulated less MOP uptake in vulnerable populations.

Stakeholder engagement in policy development: challenges and opportunities for human genomics Along with rapid advances in human genomics, policies governing genomic data and clinical technologies have proliferated. Stakeholder engagement is widely lauded as an important methodology for improving clinical, scientific, and public health policy decision making. The purpose of this paper is to examine how stakeholder engagement is used to develop policies in genomics research and public health areas, as well as to identify future priorities for conducting evidence-based stakeholder engagements. We focus on exemplars in biobanking and newborn screening to illustrate a variety of current stakeholder engagement in policy-making efforts. Each setting provides an important context for examining the methods of obtaining and integrating informed stakeholder voices into the policy-making process. While many organizations have an interest in engaging stakeholders with regard to genomic policy issues, there is broad divergence with respect to the stakeholders involved, the purpose of engagements, when stakeholders are engaged during policy development, methods of engagement, and the outcomes reported. Stakeholder engagement in genomics policy development is still at a nascent stage. Several challenges of using stakeholder engagement as a tool for genomics policy development remain, and little evidence regarding how to best incorporate stakeholder feedback into policy-making processes is currently available.Genet Med advance online publication 12 trajectories following trauma-informed treatment of women with co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorders. INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Despite advances towards integration of care for women with co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), low abstinence rates following SUD/PTSD treatment remain the norm. The utility of investigating distinct substance use trajectories is a critical innovation in the detection and refining of effective interventions for this clinical population. DESIGN AND METHODS: The present study reanalysed data from the largest randomised clinical trial to date for co-occurring SUD and PTSD in women (National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network; Women and Trauma Study). Randomised participants (n = 353) received one of two interventions in addition to treatment as usual for SUD: (i) trauma-informed integrative treatment for PTSD/SUD; or (ii) an active control psychoeducation course on women's health. The present study utilised latent growth mixture models (LGMM) with multiple groups to estimate women's substance use patterns during the 12-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Findings provided support for three different trajectories of substance use in the post-treatment year: (i) consistently low likelihood and use frequency; (ii) consistently high likelihood and use frequency; and (iii) high likelihood and moderate use frequency. Covariate analyses revealed improvement in PTSD severity was associated with membership in a specific substance use trajectory, although receiving trauma-informed treatment was not. Additionally, SUD severity, age and after-care efforts were shown to be related to trajectory membership. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the necessity of accounting for heterogeneity in post-treatment substance use, relevance of trauma-informed care in SUD recovery and benefits of incorporating methodologies like LGMM when evaluating SUD treatment doi: 10.1111/dar.12230.

Effects of Eliminating Drug Caps on Racial Differences in Antidepressant Use Among Dual Enrollees With Diabetes and Depression Black patients with diabetes are at greater risk of underuse of antidepressants even when they have equal access to health insurance. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of removing a significant financial barrier to prescription medications (drug caps) on existing black-white disparities in antidepressant treatment rates among patients with diabetes and comorbid depression. We used an interrupted time series with comparison series design and a 5% representative sample of all fee-for-service Medicare and Medicaid dual enrollees to evaluate the removal of drug caps on monthly antidepressant treatment rates. We evaluated the impact of drug cap removal on racial gaps in treatment by modeling the month-to-month white-black difference in use within age strata (younger than 65 years of age or 65 years of age or older). We compared adult dual enrollees with diabetes and comorbid depression living in states with strict drug caps (n = 221) and those without drug caps (n = 1133) before the policy change. Our primary outcome measures were the proportion of patients with any antidepressant use per month and the mean standardized monthly doses (SMDs) of antidepressants per month. The removal of drug caps in strict drug cap states was associated with a sudden increase in the proportion of patients treated for depression (4 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.03-0.05, P < 0.0001) and in the intensity of antidepressant use (SMD: 0.05; 95% CI, 0.03-0.07, P < 0.001). Although antidepressant treatment rates increased for both white and black patients, the white-black treatment gap increased immediately after Part D (0.04 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.01-0.08) and grew over time (0.04 percentage points per month; 95% CI, 0.002-0.01; P < 0.001). Policies that remove financial barriers to medications may increase depression treatment rates among patients with diabetes overall while exacerbating treatment disparities. Tailored outreach may be needed to address nonfinancial barriers to mental health services use among black patients with diabetes. Authors: Adams AS; Madden JM; et al. 1;37(3):597-609.

Patients who self-monitor blood glucose and their unused testing results To investigate the prevalence, predictors, and costs associated with unused results from self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Observational cohort study. We studied 7320 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were not prescribed insulin and who reported SMBG. Patients reported whether they used SMBG results to make adjustments to diet, exercise, or medicines; and whether their physician/provider reviewed their SMBG results. We categorized SMBG results as \"used\" (by patient and/or provider) or \"unused\" (not used by either patient or provider). SMBG results were unused by patient and provider in 15.2% of patients. In separate models adjusted for demographic and clinical differences, major predictors of SMBG without patient or physician using the results included a patient reporting that diabetes was not a high priority (relative risk [RR], 1.81; 95% CI, 1.58-2.07); the physician not engaging in shared decision making (RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.46-1.90); and no healthcare professional teaching the patient how to adjust diet/medicines based on SMBG results in the past year (RR, 2.27; 95% CI, 2.00-2.57). Patients with unused results were dispensed 171 \u00b1 191 test strips per year at an estimated annual cost of $168. Nearly 1 in 6 non-insulin-treated patients practiced SMBG without either the patient or physician using the results. This represents a wasteful and ineffective practice for patients and health systems alike. Our results suggest that the decision to initiate and continue SMBG must be made in concert with the patient's own priorities, and, if prescribed, SMBG requires effective patient provider communication and patient education.

OBJECTIVE: The current study marks the first randomized controlled trial to test the benefit of combining Seeking Safety (SS), a present-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy for co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), with sertraline, a front-line medication for PTSD shown to also impact drinking outcomes. METHOD: Sixty-nine participants (81% female; 59% African American) with primarily childhood sexual (46%) and physical (39%) trauma exposure, and drug dependence in addition to AUD were randomized to receive a partial-dose (12 sessions) of SS with either sertraline (n = 32; M = 7 sessions) or placebo (n = 37; M = 6 sessions). Assessments conducted at baseline, end-of-treatment, 6- and 12-months posttreatment measured PTSD and AUD symptom severity. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in PTSD symptoms. The SS plus sertraline group exhibited a significantly greater reduction in PTSD symptoms than the SS plus placebo group at end-of-treatment (M difference = -16.15, p = .04, d = 0.83), which was sustained at 6- and 12-month follow-up (M difference = -13.81, p = .04, d = 0.71, and M difference = -12.72, p = .05, d = 0.65, respectively). Both SS groups improved significantly on AUD severity at all posttreatment time points with no significant differences between SS plus sertraline and SS plus placebo. CONCLUSION: Results support the combining of a cognitive-behavioral therapy and sertraline for PTSD/AUD. Clinically significant reductions in both PTSD and AUD severity were achieved and sustained through 12-months follow-up, Moreover, greater mean improvement in PTSD symptoms was observed across all follow-up assessments in the SS plus sertraline group. and rare exome chip variants associate with fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes susceptibility Fasting glucose and insulin are intermediate traits for type 2 diabetes. Here we explore the role of coding variation on these traits by analysis of variants on the HumanExome BeadChip in 60,564 non-diabetic individuals and in 16,491 T2D cases and 81,877 controls. We identify a novel a low-frequency the first intron of ABO at the putative promoter of an associating with higher FG (?=0.02\u00b10.004?mmol?l(-1), P=1.3 \u00d7 10(-8)). Our approach identifies novel coding variant associations and extends the allelic spectrum of variation underlying diabetes-related quantitative traits Authors: Coaching for People With Prediabetes: A Randomized Encouragement Trial to Evaluate Outreach Methods at Kaiser Permanente, Northern California, 2013 Health coaching can improve lifestyle behaviors known to prevent or manage chronic conditions. Little is known about effective ways to encourage health and wellness coaching among people who might benefit. The purpose of this randomized encouragement trial was to assess the relative success of 3 outreach methods (secured email message, telephone message, and mailed letter) on the use of wellness coaching by people with prediabetes. A total of 14,584 Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) patients with diagnosed prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose, 110-125mg/dL) were randomly assigned to be contacted via 1 of 4 intervention arms from January through May 2013. The uptake rate (making an appointment at the Wellness Coaching Center [WCC]) was assessed, and the association between uptake rate and patient characteristics was examined via multivariable logistic regression. The overall uptake rate across intervention arms was 1.9%. Secured email message had the highest uptake rate (3.0%), followed by letters and telephone messages (P < .05 for all pairwise comparisons). No participants in the usual-care arm (ie, no outreach) made an appointment with the WCC. For each year of increased age, the estimated odds of the uptake increased by 1.02 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04). Women were nearly twice as likely to make an appointment at the WCC as men (OR = 1.87; 95% CI, 1.40-2.51). Our results suggest that the WCC can recruit and encourage KPNC members with prediabetes to participate in the WCC. Future research should focus on increasing participation rates in health coaching among patients who may benefit. Authors: Accuracy of parent-reported information for estimating prevalence of overweight and obesity in a race-ethnically diverse pediatric clinic population aged 3 to 12 There is conflicting evidence about the accuracy of estimates of childhood obesity based on parent-reported data. We assessed accuracy of child height, weight, and overweight/obesity classification in a pediatric clinic population based on parent data to learn whether accuracy differs by child age and race/ethnicity. Parents of patients ages 3-12 (n = 1,119) completed a waiting room questionnaire that asked about their child's height and weight. Child's height and weight was then measured and entered into the electronic health record (EHR) by clinic staff. The child's EHR and questionnaire data were subsequently linked. Accuracy of parent-reported height, weight, overweight/obesity classification, and parent perception of child's weight status were assessed using EHR data as the gold standard. Statistics were calculated for the full sample, two age groups (3-5, 6-12), and four racial/ethnic groups (nonHispanic White, Black, Latino, Asian). A parent-reported height was available for 59.1% of the children, weight for 75.6%, and weight classification for 53.0%. Data availability differed by race/ethnicity but not age group. Parent-reported height was accurate for 49.2% of children and weight for 58.2%. Latino children were less likely than nonHispanic Whites to have accurate height and weight data, and weight data were less accurate for 6-12 year than 3-5 year olds. Concordance of parent- and EHR-based classifications of the child as overweight/obese and obese was approximately 80% for all subgroups, with kappa statistics indicating moderate agreement. Parent-reported data significantly overestimated prevalence of overweight/obesity (50.2% vs. 35.2%) and obesity (32.1% vs. 19.4%) in the full sample and across all age and racial/ethnic subgroups. However, the percentages of parents who perceived their child to be overweight or very overweight greatly underestimated actual prevalence of overweight/obesity and obesity. Missing data did not bias parent-based overweight/obesity estimates and was not associated with child's EHR weight classification or parental perception of child's weight. While the majority of parents of overweight or obese children tend to be unaware that their child is overweight, use of parent-reported height and weight data for young children and pre-teens will likely result in overestimates of prevalence of youth overweight and Rapid-Turnaround Solution to Get Quality Improvement Data into the Hands of Medical Specialists The cost to build and to maintain traditional registries for many dire, complex, low-frequency conditions is prohibitive. The authors used accessible technology to develop a platform that would generate miniregistries (small, routinely updated datasets) for surveillance, to identify patients who were missing elected utilization and to influence clinicians to change practices to improve care. The platform, tested in 5 medical specialty departments, enabled the specialists to rapidly and effectively communicate clinical questions, knowledge of disease, clinical workflows, and improve opportunities. Each miniregistry required 1 to 2 hours of collaboration by a specialist. Turnaround was 1 to 14 days. Authors: Epub 2015-03-01. Functional Limitations, Medication Support, and Responses to Drug Costs among Medicare Beneficiaries Standard Medicare Part D prescription drug benefits include substantial and complex cost-sharing. Many beneficiaries also have functional limitations that could affect self-care capabilities, including managing medications, but also have varying levels of social support to help with these activities. We examined the associations between drug cost responses, functional limitations, and social support. We conducted telephone interviews in a stratified random sample of community-dwelling Medicare Advantage beneficiaries (N = 1,201, response rate = 70.0%). Participants reported their functional status (i.e., difficulty with activities of daily living) and social support (i.e., receiving help with medications). Drug cost responses included cost-reducing behaviors, cost-related non-adherence, and financial stress. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess associations among functional status, help with medications, and drug cost responses, adjusting for patient characteristics. Respondents with multiple limitations who did not receive help with their medications were more likely to report cost-related non-adherence (OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 1.2-8.5) and financial stress (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3-4.5) compared to subjects with fewer limitations and no help; however, those with multiple limitations and with medication help had similar odds of unfavorable cost responses as those with fewer limitations. The majority of beneficiaries with functional limitations did not receive help with medications. Support with medication management for beneficiaries who have functional limitations could improve adherence and outcomes. Authors: Whaley C; Reed 2015;10(12):e0144236. Epub 2015-12-07. The organizational dynamics enabling patient portal impacts upon organizational performance and patient health: a qualitative study of Kaiser Permanente Patient portals may lead to enhanced disease management, health plan retention, changes in channel utilization, and lower environmental waste. However, despite growing research on patient portals and their effects, our understanding of the organizational dynamics that explain how effects come about is limited. This paper uses qualitative methods to advance our understanding of the organizational dynamics that influence the impact of a patient portal on organizational performance and patient health. The study setting is Kaiser Permanente, the world's largest not-for-profit integrated delivery system, which has been using a portal for over ten years. We interviewed eighteen physician leaders and executives particularly knowledgeable about the portal to learn about how they believe the patient portal works and what organizational factors affect its workings. Our analytical framework centered on two research questions. (1) How does the patient portal impact care delivery to produce the documented effects?; and (2) What are the important organizational factors that influence the patient portal's development? We identify five ways in which the patient portal may impact care delivery to produce reported effects. First, the portal's ability to ease access to services improves some patients' satisfaction as well as changes the way patients seek care. Second, the transparency and activation of information enable some patients to better manage their care. Third, care management may also be improved through augmented patient-physician interaction. This augmented interaction may also increase the 'stickiness' of some patients to their providers. Forth, a similar effect may be triggered by a closer connection between Kaiser Permanente and patients, which may reduce the likelihood that patients will switch health plans. Finally, the portal may induce efficiencies in physician workflow and administrative tasks, stimulating certain operational savings and deeper involvement of patients in medical decisions. Moreover, our analysis illuminated seven organizational factors of particular importance to the portal's development-and thereby ability to impact care delivery: alignment with financial incentives, synergy with existing IT infrastructure and operations, physician-led governance, inclusive decision making and knowledge sharing, regional flexibility to implementation, continuous innovation, and emphasis on patient-centered design. These findings show how organizational dynamics enable the patient portal to affect care delivery by summoning organization-wide support for and use of a portal that meets patient needs.

Factors associated with use and non-use of the Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) kit for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Response to a 2012 outreach screening program: a survey study The one-sample fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is gaining popularity for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening of average-risk people. However, uptake and annual use remain suboptimal. In 2013, we mailed questionnaires to three groups of nonHispanic White, Black, and Latino Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) members ages 52-76 who received FIT kits in 2010-2012: Continuers did the FIT all 3 years; Converts in 2012, but not 2010 or 2011; and Nonusers in none of the 3 years. The questionnaires covered social influences, perceived CRC risk, reasons for using (Continuers, Converts) or avoiding using (Nonusers) the FIT, and recommendations for improving the kit. Continuers (n?=?607, response rate 67.5%), Converts (n?=?317, response rate 35.6%), and Nonusers (n?=?215, response rate 21.1%) did not differ in perceived risk or family history of CRC, but Nonusers were less likely than Continuers and Converts to know someone who had polyps or CRC. Continuers, Converts, and Nonusers did not differ in social network encouragement of CRC screening, but did differ in believing that it was very important that they be screened (88.3%, 68.4%, 47.7%) and that their medical team thought it very important that they be screened (88.6%, 79.9%, 53.9%). Approximately half of Continuers and Converts completed the FIT to please their doctor. Converts were less likely than Continuers to use the FIT to \"make sure they were OK\" (53.7% vs. 72.6%) or \"protect their health\" (46.1% vs. 76.4%). Nearly half of Converts completed the FIT out of guilt. Approximately half of FIT kit users suggested adding a disposable glove, extra paper, and wider-mouth tube to the kit. Nonusers' reasons for not using the FIT included discomfort, disgust, or embarrassment (59.6%); thinking it unnecessary (32.9%); fatalism/fear (15.5%); and thinking it too difficult to use (14.5%), but <10% did not want CRC screening at all. Nonusers and irregular users of the FIT are less intrinsically motivated to get CRC screening than long-term users and more averse to preparing their stool sample. Changes to the FIT kit to address discomfort and difficulty factors might improve uptake and continued use. Authors: Gordon NP; Green BB BMC Public Health. 2015;15:546. Epub 2015-06-11. Trends in Diabetes Incidence Among 7 Million Insured Adults, 2006-2011: The SUPREME-DM Project An observational cohort analysis was conducted within the Surveillance, Prevention, and Management of Diabetes Mellitus (SUPREME-DM) DataLink, a consortium of 11 integrated health-care delivery systems with electronic health records in 10 US states. Among nearly 7 million adults aged 20 years or older, we estimated annual diabetes incidence per 1,000 persons overall and by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index. We identified 289,050 incident cases of diabetes. Age- and sex-adjusted population incidence was stable between 2006 and 2010, ranging from 10.3 per 1,000 adults (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.8, 10.7) to 11.3 per 1,000 adults (95% CI: 11.0, 11.7). Adjusted incidence was significantly higher in 2011 (11.5, 95% CI: 10.9, 12.0) than in the 2 years with the lowest incidence. A similar pattern was observed in most prespecified subgroups, but only the differences for persons who were not white were significant. In 2006, 56% of incident cases had a glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c) test as one of the pair of events identifying diabetes. By 2011, that number was 74%. In conclusion, overall diabetes incidence in this population did not significantly increase between 2006 and 2010, but increases in hemoglobin A1c testing may have contributed to rising diabetes incidence among nonwhites in 2011.

Bringing patients' social context into the examination room: an investigation of the discussion of social influence during contraceptive counseling Although social networks are an increasingly recognized influence on contraceptive use, little is known about if and how social influences are discussed during women's contraceptive counseling visits. We performed a mixed-methods analysis of audio recordings of contraceptive counseling visits. We examined predictors of discussion of social influence arising in a contraceptive counseling visit and analyzed the content and process of social influence discussions. Social influences were mentioned in 42% of the 342 visits included in the sample, with these discussions most commonly initiated by patients. Younger patients were more likely to have social influence mentioned than older patients. The content of social influence focused on side effects and adverse events, with the sources of influence being predominantly patients' friends and the media, with little input from partners. Providers were more likely to engage around the content of the social influence than the social influence itself. The frequency with which social influence was mentioned in these visits supports the importance of women's social context on their contraceptive decision making. However, the fact that patients initiated the discussion in the majority of cases suggests that providers may not recognize the relevance of these influences or may not be comfortable engaging with them. Increasing providers' ability to elicit and engage patients about their social context with regard to contraception could enhance providers' ability to understand women's contraceptive preferences and provide appropriate counseling to address their specific concerns or questions. Timing of Discharge Follow-up for Acute Pulmonary Embolism: Retrospective Cohort Study Historically, emergency department (ED) patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) have been admitted for several days of inpatient care. Growing evidence suggests that selected ED patients with PE can be safely discharged home after a short length of stay. However, the optimal timing of follow up is unknown. We hypothesized that higher-risk patients with short length of stay (<24 hours from ED registration) would more commonly receive expedited follow up (?3 days). This retrospective cohort study included adults treated for acute PE in six community EDs. We ascertained the PE Severity Index risk class (for 30-day mortality), facility length of stay, the first follow-up clinician encounter, unscheduled return ED visits readmissions, and 30-day all-cause mortality. Stratifying by risk class, we used multivariable analysis to examine age- and sex-adjusted associations between length of stay and expedited follow up. The mean age of our 175 patients was 63.2 (\u00b116.8) years. Overall, 93.1% (n=163) of our cohort received follow up within one week of discharge. Fifty-six patients (32.0%) were sent home within 24 hours and 100 (57.1%) received expedited follow up, often by telephone (67/100). The short and longer length-of-stay groups were comparable in age and sex, but differed in rates of low-risk status (63% vs 37%; p<0.01) and expedited follow up (70% vs 51%; p=0.03). After adjustment, we found that short length of stay was independently associated with expedited follow up in higher-risk patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.5; 95% [0.8-5.7]; p=0.11). Adverse outcomes were uncommon (<2%) and were not significantly different between the two length-of-stay groups. Higher-risk patients with acute PE and short length of stay more commonly received expedited follow up in our community setting than other groups of patients. These practice patterns are associated with low rates of 30-day adverse events. Authors: Vinson DR; Emerg Med. 2015 Jan;16(1):55-61. Epub 2015-01-12. Pneumothorax is a rare complication of thoracic central venous catheterization in community EDs The rate of iatrogenic pneumothorax associated with thoracic central venous catheterization in community emergency departments (EDs) is poorly described, although such information is vital to inform the procedure's risk/benefit analysis. We undertook this multicenter study to estimate the incidence of immediate catheter-related pneumothorax in community EDs and to determine associations with site of access, failed access, and positive pressure ventilation. This was a secondary analysis of 2 retrospective cohort studies of adults who underwent attempted thoracic central venous catheterization in 1 of 21 EDs. Pneumothorax was identified by postprocedural anteroposterior chest radiograph or emergent evacuation for presumed tension pneumothorax. Frequencies were compared using Fisher's exact test. Among 1249 patient encounters, the initial vein of catheterization was internal jugular in 1054 cases (84.4%) and subclavian in 195 cases (15.6%). Success at the initial internal jugular vein was more common than at the initial subclavian vein (95.4% vs 83.6%, P < .001). Periprocedural positive pressure ventilation was administered in 316 patients (25.3%). We identified 6 pneumothoraces (0.5%; 95% confidence interval, 0.2%-1.1%). The incidence of pneumothorax was higher with the subclavian vein than the internal jugular vein (2.3% vs 0.1%, P < .001), with failed access at the initial vein (2.5% vs 0.3%, P = .05), and among patients receiving positive pressure ventilation (1.6% vs 0.1%, P < .01). The incidence of pneumothorax from thoracic central venous catheterization in community EDs is low. The risk of pneumothorax is higher with a subclavian vein approach, failed access at the initial vein, and positive pressure ventilation. Authors: Vinson Am J Emerg Med. 2015 Jan;33(1):60-6.

The Study to Understand the Genetics of the Acute Response to Metformin and Glipizide in Humans (SUGAR-MGH): Design of a pharmacogenetic Resource for Type 2 Diabetes Genome-wide association studies have uncovered a large number of genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes or related phenotypes. In many cases the causal gene or polymorphism has not been identified, and its impact on response to anti-hyperglycemic medications is unknown. The Study to Understand the Genetics of the Acute Response to Metformin and Glipizide in Humans (SUGAR-MGH, NCT01762046) is a novel resource of genetic and biochemical data following glipizide and metformin administration. We describe recruitment, enrollment, and phenotyping procedures and preliminary results for the first 668 of our planned 1,000 participants enriched for individuals at risk of requiring anti-diabetic therapy in the future. All individuals are challenged with 5 mg glipizide \u00d7 1; twice daily 500 mg metformin \u00d7 2 days; and 75-g oral glucose tolerance test following metformin. Genetic variants associated with glycemic traits and blood glucose, insulin, and other hormones at baseline and following each intervention are measured. Approximately 50% of the cohort is female and 30% belong to an ethnic minority group. Following glipizide administration, peak insulin occurred at 60 minutes and trough glucose at 120 minutes. Thirty percent of participants experienced non-severe symptomatic hypoglycemia and required rescue with oral glucose. Following metformin administration, fasting glucose and insulin were reduced. Common genetic variants were associated with fasting glucose levels. SUGAR-MGH represents a viable pharmacogenetic resource which, when completed, will serve to characterize genetic influences on pharmacological perturbations, and help establish the functional relevance of newly discovered genetic loci to therapy of type 2 2015-03-26. An Innovative Approach to Informing Research: Gathering Perspectives on Diabetes Care Challenges From an Online Patient Community Funding agencies and researchers increasingly recognize the importance of patient stakeholder engagement in research. Despite calls for greater patient engagement, few studies have engaged a broad-based online community of patient stakeholders in the early stages of the research development process. The objective of our study was to inform a research priority-setting agenda by using a Web-based survey to gather perceptions of important and difficult aspects of diabetes care from patient members of a social networking site-based community. Invitations to participate in a Web-based survey were sent by email to members of the PatientsLikeMe online diabetes community. The survey asked both quantitative and qualitative questions addressing individuals' level of difficulty with diabetes care, provider communication, medication management, diet and exercise, and relationships with others. Qualitative responses were analyzed using content analysis. Of 6219 PatientsLikeMe members with diabetes who were sent survey invitations, 1044 (16.79%) opened the invitation and 320 (5.15% of 6219; 30.65% of 1044) completed the survey within 23 days. Of the 320 respondents, 33 (10.3%) reported having Type 1 diabetes; 107 (33.4%), Type 2 diabetes and taking insulin; and 180 (56.3%), Type 2 diabetes and taking oral agents or controlling their diabetes with lifestyle modifications. Compared to 2005-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data for individuals with diabetes, our respondents were younger (mean age 55.8 years, SD 9.9 vs 59.4 years, SE 0.5); less likely to be male (111/320, 34.6% vs 48.4%); and less likely to be a racial or ethnic minority (40/312, 12.8% vs 37.5%). Of 29 potential challenges in diabetes care, 19 were categorized as difficult by 20% or more of respondents. Both quantitative and qualitative results indicated that top patient challenges were lifestyle concerns (diet, physical activity, weight, and stress) and interpersonal concerns (trying not to be a burden to others, getting support from family/friends). In our quantitative analysis, similar concerns were expressed across patient subgroups. Lifestyle and interpersonal factors were particularly challenging for our online sample of adults with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Our study demonstrates the innovative use of social networking sites and online communities to gather rapid, meaningful, and relevant patient perspectives that can be used to inform the development of research agendas.

Creating patient-centered health care systems to improve outcomes and reduce disparities Health care delivery systems that are designed to understand and meet patient preferences for care have the potential to improve health outcomes and reduce disparities. Studies that rigorously assess patient care preferences in minority and underserved populations, stakeholder engagement, and policies that promote a diverse health care workforce that can address patient preferences are important levers for improving care for vulnerable populations.

The Accuracy of an Electronic Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index Auto-Populated from the Electronic Health Record: Setting the stage for computerized clinical decision support The Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Severity Index identifies emergency department (ED) patients with acute PE that can be safely managed without hospitalization. However, the Index comprises 11 weighted variables, complexity that can impede its integration into contextual workflow. We designed a computerized version of the PE Severity Index (e-Index) to automatically extract the required variables from discrete fields in the electronic health record (EHR). We tested the e-Index on the study population to determine its accuracy compared with a gold standard generated by physician abstraction of the EHR on manual chart review. This retrospective cohort study included adults with objectively-confirmed acute PE in four community EDs from 2010-2012. Outcomes included performance characteristics of the e-Index for individual values, the number of cases requiring physician editing, and the accuracy of the e-Index risk category (low vs. higher). For the 593 eligible patients, there were 6,523 values automatically extracted. Fifty one of these needed physician editing, yielding an accuracy at the value-level of 99.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 99.0%-99.4%). and specificity was 99.8% (95% CI, 99.7%-99.9%). The 51 corrected values were distributed among 47 cases: 43 cases required the correction of one variable and four cases required the correction of two. At the risk-category level, the e-Index had an accuracy of 96.8% 3 low-risk cases (0.5%). Our automated extraction of variables from the EHR for the e-Index demonstrates substantial accuracy, requiring a minimum of physician editing. This should increase user acceptability and implementation success of a computerized clinical decision support system built around the e-Index, and may serve as a model to automate other complex risk stratification instruments. Authors: Vinson DR; of Pediatric-Onset Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Objectives. To assess the relationship between infections and the risk of pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods. We conducted a nested case-control study of 501 incident cases aged ?17 years and 9,442 controls who were members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California for at least one consecutive year between 1996 and 2006. IBD was confirmed and the incidence date was adjudicated by pediatric gastroenterologists. Hospitalized infections were identified from the principal diagnosis code of electronic inpatient records. Medications to treat infections were identified during the hospitalization. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the associations between hospitalized infections, medications, and Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Results. In the year prior to diagnosis, both hospitalized infection of any system (OR 6.3; 95% CI 1.6-23.9) and hospitalized intestinal infection (OR 19.4; 95% CI 2.6-143.2) were associated with CD. Hospitalized infections of any system were inversely associated with UC after excluding the year prior to diagnosis (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2-0.9). No UC case had a hospitalized gastrointestinal infection prior to diagnosis. Conclusion. Infections appear to play opposite roles prior to the diagnosis of CD and UC. Infections may be associated with an increased risk of CD and a decreased risk of UC.

Linguistic characteristics in a non-trauma-related narrative task are associated with PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity. Linguistic characteristics of trauma narratives have been linked to the development and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, it remains unclear if linguistic markers of PTSD exist beyond the scope of trauma narratives. This study used ambiguous visual prompts to elicit spontaneous narratives from trauma-exposed individuals with (n = 23) and without PTSD (n = 30). Individuals with PTSD used more singular pronouns and death-related words, and fewer plural pronouns. Within the PTSD group, increased severity of reexperiencing symptoms was associated with greater use of singular pronouns and lower use of cognitive words; increased severity of avoidance symptoms was associated with lower use of death words; and increased severity of hyperarousal symptoms was associated with less frequent use of anxiety words. Together, these linguistic variables accounted for 53% of the variance in total PTSD symptom severity. These findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that language use is a strong predictor of PTSD psychopathology, and extend the evidence to include the linguistic characteristics of non-trauma-related 2014 Dec 22. Randomized Trial of Telephone Outreach to Improve Medication Adherence and Metabolic Control in Adults With Diabetes Medication nonadherence is a major obstacle to better control of glucose, blood pressure (BP), and LDL cholesterol in adults with diabetes. Inexpensive effective strategies to increase medication adherence are needed. In a pragmatic randomized trial, we randomly assigned 2,378 adults with diabetes mellitus who had recently been prescribed a new class of medication for treating elevated levels of glycated hemoglobin (A1C) ?8% (64 mmol/mol), BP ?140/90 mmHg, cholesterol ?100 mg/dL, to receive 1) one scripted telephone call from a diabetes educator or clinical pharmacist to identify and address nonadherence to the new medication or 2) usual care. Hierarchical linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the impact on 1) the first medication fill within 60 days of the prescription; 2) two or more medication fills within 180 days of the prescription; and 3) clinically significant improvement in levels of A1C, BP, or LDL cholesterol. Of the 2,378 subjects, 89.3% in the intervention group and 87.4% in the usual-care group had sufficient data to analyze study outcomes. In intent-to-treat analyses, intervention was not associated with significant improvement in primary adherence, medication persistence, or intermediate outcomes of care. Results were similar across subgroups of patients defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and study site, and when limiting the analysis to those who completed the intended intervention. This low-intensity intervention did not significantly improve medication adherence or control of glucose, BP, or LDL cholesterol. Wide use of this strategy does not appear to be warranted; alternative approaches to identify and improve medication adherence and persistence are needed.

Medicare Star excludes diabetes patients with poor CVD risk factor control CMS recently added medication adherence to antihypertensives, antihyperlipidemics, and oral antihyperglycemics to its Medicare Star quality measures. These CMS metrics exclude patients with <2 medication fills (ie, \"early nonadherence\") and patients concurrently taking insulin. This study examined the proportion of patients with diabetes prescribed cardiovascular disease (CVD) medications excluded from Star adherence metrics and assessed the relationship of both Star-defined adherence and exclusion from Star metrics with CVD risk factor control. Cross-sectional, population-based analysis of 129,040 patients with diabetes aged ?65 years in 2010 from 3 Kaiser Permanente regions. We estimated adjusted risk ratios to assess the relationship between achieving Star adherence and being excluded from Star adherence metrics, with CVD risk factor control (glycated hemoglobin [A1C]<8.0%, mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure [SBP]<130 mm Hg) in patients with diabetes. Star metrics excluded 27% of patients with diabetes prescribed oral medications. Star-defined nonadherence was negatively associated with CVD risk factor [RR], Exclusion from Star metrics due to early nonadherence was also strongly associated with poor control (RR, 0.83, 0.56, 0.87 for A1C, LDL-C, and SBP control, respectively; P<.001). Exclusion for insulin use was negatively associated with A1C control (RR, 0.78; P<.0001). Medicare Star adherence measures underestimate the prevalence of medication nonadherence in diabetes and exclude patients at high risk for poor CVD outcomes. Up to 3 million elderly patients with diabetes may be excluded from these measures nationally.

Electronic Health Record (EHR) use could improve care quality and efficiency in part by facilitating care coordination. We examined the association between EHR use and clinician perceptions of care coordination for patients transferred across clinicians and delivery sites. Repeated surveys of primary care clinicians during the staggered implementation of an outpatient EHR (2005-2008), followed by an integrated inpatient EHR (2006-2010). We measured the association between EHR use stages (no use, outpatient EHR only, and integrated inpatient-outpatient EHR) and care coordination using logistic regression, adjusting for clinician characteristics, study year, and medical center. Adult primary care clinicians in a large Integrated Delivery System. Three measures of clinician-reported care coordination for patient care transferred across clinicians (eg, from specialist to primary care team) and across delivery sites (eg, from the hospital to outpatient care). Outpatient EHR use was associated with higher reports of access to complete and timely clinical information and higher agreement on clinician roles and responsibilities for patients transferred across clinicians, but not for patients transferred across delivery sites. Use of the integrated outpatient-inpatient EHR was associated with higher reports of access to timely and complete clinical information, clinician agreement on the patient's treatment plan for patients transferred across delivery sites, and with all coordination measures for patients transferred across clinicians. Use of an integrated EHR with health information exchange across delivery settings improved patient care coordination. Authors: Med Care. 2014 Dec;52(12):1037-41. Outcomes from ultrasound follow-up of small complex adnexal masses in women over 50 The discovery of a complex adnexal mass in an older woman often raises concern for cancer. We evaluate outcomes for a large population-based cohort of women older than age 50 years with a small complex adnexal mass reported on ultrasound, without elevated CA125 or other evidence of malignancy, including time to detection of malignancy and stage at diagnosis for those initially observed. Women older than age 50 years who had an ultrasound during 2007-2011 reporting a complex adnexal mass 1-6 cm in size were identified. Previous or subsequent pelvic ultrasounds were reviewed to determine when the mass was first identified and whether there was change over time. Women with concurrent elevated CA125, evidence of metastatic disease, or less than 24 months of clinical follow-up were excluded. Surgical pathology from removal and diagnoses of ovarian cancer within 24 months of follow-up were identified. Among 1363 complex masses identified, 18 cancers or borderline tumors (1.3%; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-2.1%) were found. Six cases were diagnosed among 204 women who had immediate surgery after initial ultrasound (15%), and 12 additional cases were found among 994 women with at least 1 repeat ultrasound (73%). Growth was apparent on ultrasound by 7 months for all borderline and epithelial ovarian cancers. Of the 12 cases diagnosed during follow-up, 10 were found to be stage 1 at surgery. Among isolated adnexal masses reported as complex and 1-6 cm on pelvic ultrasound in women older than 50 years, the overall risk of malignancy is low. All cases of epithelial cancer and borderline tumor demonstrated growth by 7 months of observation. Authors: Suh-Burgmann E; Hung YY; 2014 Dec;211(6):623.e1-7. Epub 2014-07-25. Social Support and Lifestyle vs. Medical Diabetes Self-Management in the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) In chronic illness self-care, social support may influence some health behaviors more than others. Examine social support's association with seven individual chronic illness self-management behaviors: two healthy \"lifestyle\" behaviors (physical activity, diet) and five more highly skilled and diabetes-specific (medical) behaviors (checking feet, oral medication adherence, insulin adherence, self-monitored blood glucose, primary care appointment attendance). Using cross-sectional administrative and survey data from 13,366 patients with type 2 diabetes, Poisson regression models estimated the adjusted relative risks (ARR) of practicing each behavior at higher vs lower levels of social support. Higher emotional support and social network scores were significantly associated with increased ARR of both lifestyle behaviors. Both social support measures were also associated with increased ARR for checking feet. Neither measure was significantly associated with other medical behaviors. Findings suggest that social support diminished in importance as self-care progresses from lifestyle to more Med. 2014 Dec;48(3):438-47. Reliability and validity of a survey to measure bowel function and quality of life in long-term rectal cancer survivors Examination of reliability and validity of a specialized health-related quality of life questionnaire for rectal cancer (RC) survivors (?5 years post-diagnosis). We mailed 1,063 Kaiser Permanente (KP) RC survivors (313 ostomy and 750 anastomosis) a questionnaire containing the Modified City of Hope Quality of Life-Ostomy (mCOH-QOL-O), SF-12v2, Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire (FSSQ), and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Bowel Function Index (BFI). We adapted certain BFI items for use by subjects with intestinal ostomies. We evaluated reliability for all instruments with inter-item correlations and Cronbach's alpha. We assessed construct validity only for the BFI in the ostomy group, because such use has not been reported. The overall response rate was 60.5 % (577 respondents/953 eligible). Compared with non-responders, participants were on average 2 years younger and more likely non-Hispanic white, resided in educationally non-deprived areas, and had KP membership through a group. The mCOH-QOL-O, SF-12, and FSSQ were found to be highly reliable for RC survivors. In the ostomy group, BFI Urgency/Soilage and Dietary subscales were found to be reliable, but Frequency was not. Factor analysis supported the construct of Urgency/Soilage and Dietary subscales in the ostomy group, although one item had a moderate correlation with all three factors. The BFI also demonstrated good concurrent validity with other instruments in the ostomy group. With possible exception of the BFI Frequency subscale in populations with ostomies, components of our survey can be used for the entire population of RC survivors, no matter whether they received Epub 2014-06-03. Incidence of Remission in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: The Diabetes & Aging Study To estimate the incidence of remission in adults with type 2 diabetes not treated with bariatric surgery and to identify variables associated with remission. We quantified the incidence of diabetes remission and examined its correlates among 122,781 adults with type 2 diabetes in an integrated healthcare delivery system. Remission required the absence of ongoing drug therapy and was defined as follows: 1) partial: at least 1 year level 5.7-6.4% level <5.7% [<39 mmol/mol]); and 3) prolonged: complete remission for at least 5 years. The incidence density (remissions per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI) of partial, complete, or prolonged remission was 2.8 (2.6-2.9), 0.24 (0.20-0.28), and 0.04 (0.01-0.06), respectively. The 7-year cumulative incidence of partial, complete, or prolonged remission was 1.47% (1.40-1.54%), 0.14% (0.12-0.16%), and 0.007% (0.003-0.020%), respectively. The 7-year cumulative incidence of achieving any remission was 1.60% in the whole cohort (1.53-1.68%) and 4.6% in the subgroup with new-onset diabetes (<2 years since diagnosis) (4.3-4.9%). After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, correlates of remission included age >65 years, African American race, <2 years since diagnosis, baseline HbA?c level <5.7% (<39 mmol/mol), and no diabetes medication at baseline. In community settings, remission of type 2 diabetes does occur without bariatric surgery, but it is very S; Epub Comparative Effectiveness of Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Gastric Bypass Laparoscopic bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (AGB) are 2 of the most commonly performed bariatric procedures worldwide. However, few large, multisite studies have directly compared the benefits and harms of these procedures. To compare the effect of laparoscopic RYGB vs AGB on short- and long-term health outcomes. A retrospective cohort study of 7457 individuals 21 years or older who underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009, with follow-up through December 31, 2010. All individuals were participants in the Scalable Partnering Network, a network of 10 demographically and geographically distributed health care systems in the United States. The primary outcomes were (1) change in body mass index (BMI), (2) a composite end point of 30-day rate of major adverse outcomes (death, venous thromboembolism, subsequent intervention, and failure to discharge from the hospital), (3) subsequent hospitalization, and (4) subsequent intervention. We identified 7457 patients who underwent laparoscopic AGB or RYGB procedures with a median follow-up time of 2.3 years (maximum, 6 years). The mean maximum BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) loss was 8.0 (95% CI, 7.8-8.3) for AGB patients and 14.8 (95% CI, 14.6-14.9) for RYGB patients (P < .001). In propensity score-adjusted models, the hazard ratio for AGB vs RYGB patients experiencing any 30-day major adverse event was 0.46 (95% CI, 0.27-0.80; P = .006). The hazard ratios comparing AGB vs RYGB patients experiencing subsequent intervention and hospitalization were 3.31 (95% CI, 2.65-4.14; P < .001) and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.61-0.88; P < .001), respectively. In this large bariatric cohort from 10 health care systems, we found that RYGB resulted in much greater weight loss than AGB but had a higher risk of short-term complications and long-term subsequent hospitalizations. On the other hand, RYGB patients had a lower risk of long-term subsequent intervention procedures than AGB patients. Bariatric surgery candidates should be well informed of these benefits and risks when they make their decisions about treatment. Authors: Arterburn D; Dec;149(12):1279-87. Trends in Elective Labor Induction for Six United States Health Plans, 2001-2007 To describe trends in labor induction, including elective induction, from 2001 to 2007 for six U.S. health plans and to examine the validity of induction measures derived from birth certificate and health plan data. This retrospective cohort study included 339,123 deliveries at 35 weeks' gestation or greater. Linked health plan and birth certificate data provided information about induction, maternal medical conditions, and pregnancy complications. Induction was defined from diagnosis and procedure codes and birth certificate data and considered elective if no accepted indication was coded. We calculated induction prevalence across health plans and years. At four health plans, we reviewed medical records to validate induction measures. Based on electronic data, induction prevalence rose from 28% in 2001 to 32% in 2005, then declined to 29% in 2007. The trend was driven by changes in the prevalence of apparent elective induction, which rose from 11% in 2001 to 14% in 2005 and then declined to 11% in 2007. The trend was similar for subgroups by parity and gestational age. Elective induction prevalence varied considerably across plans. On review of 86 records, 36% of apparent elective inductions identified from electronic data were confirmed as valid. Elective induction appeared to peak in 2005 and then decline. The decrease may reflect quality improvement initiatives or changes in policies, patient or provider attitudes, or coding practices. The low validation rate for measures of elective induction defined from electronic data has important implications for existing quality measures and for research studies examining induction's outcomes.

Despite the lack of clinical research, marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids have been approved to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in several states in the United States. This review critically examines preclinical research on the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in order to evaluate three key questions that are relevant to PTSD: (1) Does ECS dysfunction impact fear extinction? (2) Can stress-related symptoms be prevented by ECS modulation? (3) Is the ECS a potential target for enhancing PTSD treatment? Disruption of the ECS impaired fear extinction in rodents, and ECS abnormalities have been observed in PTSD. Targeting fear memories via the ECS had mixed results in rodents, whereas augmented cannabinoid receptor activation typically facilitated extinction. However, the translational value of these findings is limited by the paucity and inconsistency of human research. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether incorporating cannabinoids in treatment would benefit individuals with PTSD, with cautious attention to Nov 4. At the crossroads: the intersection of substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The co-occurrence of substance use disorders with anxiety disorders and/or posttraumatic stress disorder has been widely documented and when compared to each disorder alone, consistently linked to increased risk for a host of negative outcomes including greater impairment, poorer treatment response, and higher rates of symptom relapse. This article focuses on recent advances in the understanding and effective treatment of this common and highly complex comorbidity. Prevalence and epidemiological data are introduced, followed by a review of contemporary models of etiology and associative pathways. Conceptualizations of effective treatment approaches are discussed alongside evidence from the past decade of clinical research trials. Highlighted are ongoing questions regarding the benefit of sequential, parallel, and integrated approaches and the necessity of further investigation into the mechanisms underlying treatment efficacy. Lastly, recent contributions from neuroscience research are offered as a promising bridge for the development and testing of novel, interdisciplinary Non-viral opportunistic infections in new users of tumour necrosis factor inhibitor therapy: results of the SAfety Assessment of Biologic ThERapy (SABER) Study To determine among patients with autoimmune diseases in the USA whether the risk of non-viral opportunistic infections (OI) was increased among new users of tumour necrosis factor ? inhibitors (TNFI), when compared to users of non-biological agents used for active disease. We identified new users of TNFI among cohorts of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis-psoriatic arthritis-ankylosing spondylitis patients during 1998-2007 using combined data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, two pharmaceutical assistance programmes for the elderly, Tennessee Medicaid and US Medicaid/Medicare programmes. We compared incidence of non-viral OI among new TNFI users and patients initiating non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) overall and within each disease cohort. Cox regression models were used to compare propensity-score and steroid- adjusted OI incidence between new TNFI and non-biological DMARD users. Within a cohort of 33?324 new TNFI users we identified 80 non-viral OI, the most common of which was pneumocystosis (n=16). In the combined cohort, crude rates of non-viral OI among new users of TNFI compared to those initiating non-biological DMARD was 2.7 versus 1.7 per 1000-person-years (aHR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.6). Baseline corticosteroid use was associated with non-viral OI (aHR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.0). In the RA cohort, rates of non-viral OI among new users of infliximab were higher when compared to patients newly starting non-biological DMARD (aHR 2.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.6) or new etanercept users (aHR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5 to 5.4). In the USA, the rate of non-viral OI was higher among new users of TNFI with autoimmune diseases compared to non-biological DMARD users. Authors: JW; Solomon Dis. 2014 Nov;73(11):1942-8.

Lack of improved outcomes with increased use of targeted temperature management following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A multicenter retrospective cohort study To assess whether increased use of targeted temperature management (TTM) within an integrated healthcare delivery system resulted in improved rates of good neurologic outcome at hospital discharge (Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2). Retrospective cohort study of patients with OHCA admitted to 21 medical centers between January 2007 and December 2012. A standardized TTM protocol and educational program were introduced throughout the system in early 2009. Comatose patients eligible for treatment with TTM were included. Adjusted odds of good neurologic outcome at hospital discharge and survival to hospital discharge were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. A total of 1119 patients were admitted post-OHCA with coma, 59.1% (661 of 1119) of which were eligible for TTM. The percentage of patients treated with TTM markedly increased during the study period: 10.5% in the years preceding (2007-2008) vs. 85.1% in the years following (2011-2012) implementation of the practice improvement initiative. However, unadjusted in-hospital survival (37.3% vs. 39.0%, p=0.77) and good neurologic outcome at hospital discharge (26.3% vs. 26.6%, p=1.0) did not change. The adjusted odds of survival to hospital discharge (AOR 1.0, 95% CI 0.85-1.17) or a good neurologic outcome (AOR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79-1.11) were likewise non-significant. Despite a marked increase in TTM rates across hospitals in an integrated delivery system, there was no appreciable change in the crude or adjusted odds of in-hospital survival or good neurologic outcomes at hospital discharge among eligible post-arrest patients. Authors: DG; of the Modified Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale among Women with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Substance Use Disorders Receiving Outpatient Group Treatments. OBJECTIVE: The use of psychometrically sound measures to assess and monitor PTSD treatment response over time is critical for better understanding the relationship between PTSD symptoms and Substance Use Disorder (SUD) symptoms throughout treatment. We examined the psychometric properties of the Modified Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptom Scale, Self-Report (MPSS-SR). METHODS: Three hundred fifty three women diagnosed with co-occurring PTSD (full or sub-threshold) and SUD who participated in a multisite treatment trial completed the MPSS-SR at pre-treatment, weekly during treatment, and posttreatment. Reliability and validity analyses were applied to the data. RESULTS: Internal consistency was excellent throughout the course of the trial demonstrating the MPSS-SR's high reliability. Strong correlations between MPSS-SR scores and the Brief Symptom Inventory and the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) severity scores demonstrated the MPSS-SR's convergent and concurrent validity. We conducted a classification analysis at posttreatment and compared the MPSS-SR at various cutoff scores with the CAPS diagnosis. A cutoff score of 29 on the MPSS-SR yielded a sensitivity rate of 89%, a specificity rate of 77%, and an overall classification rate of 80%, indicating the measure's robust ability to accurately identify individuals with PTSD in our sample at posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the use of the MPSS-SR as a reliable and valid tool to assess and monitor changes in PTSD symptoms over the course of treatment and as an alternative to structured clinical interviews to assess PTSD symptoms among doi: 10.4172/2324-8947.1000139.

Trends in red blood cell transfusion and 30-day mortality among hospitalized patients Blood conservation strategies have been shown to be effective in decreasing red blood cell (RBC) utilization in specific patient groups. However, few data exist describing the extent of RBC transfusion reduction or their impact on transfusion practice and mortality in a diverse inpatient population. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using comprehensive electronic medical record data from 21 medical facilities in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We examined unadjusted and risk-adjusted RBC transfusion and 30-day mortality coincident with implementation of RBC conservation strategies. The inpatient study cohort included 391,958 patients who experienced 685,753 hospitalizations. From 2009 to 2013, the incidence of RBC transfusion decreased from 14.0% to 10.8% of hospitalizations; this change coincided with a decline in pretransfusion hemoglobin (Hb) levels from 8.1 to 7.6?g/dL. Decreased RBC utilization affected broad groups of admission diagnoses and was most pronounced in patients with a nadir Hb level between 8 and 9?g/dL (n?=?73,057; 50.8% to 19.3%). During the study period, the standard deviation of risk-adjusted RBC transfusion incidence across hospitals decreased by 44% (p?0.001). Thirty-day mortality did not change significantly with declines in RBC utilization in patient groups previously studied in clinical trials nor in other subgroups. After the implementation of blood conservation strategies, RBC transfusion incidence and pretransfusion Hb levels decreased broadly across medical and surgical patients. Variation in RBC transfusion incidence across hospitals decreased from 2010 to 2013. Consistent with clinical trial data, more restrictive transfusion practice did not appear to impact 30-day mortality.

Initiation of TNF change in physiologic measures in psoriasis Psoriasis may predispose to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor in mediating this risk is controversial. To assess this relationship, we estimated change in metabolic physiologic measures before and after initiation of TNF inhibitor therapy compared with methotrexate (MTX) therapy among psoriasis patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study, 2007-2012, using computerized clinical data for 1274 new users of TNF inhibitor and 979 new users of MTX therapy to compare change in blood pressure, lipids, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and body mass index (BMI) before and after start of TNF inhibitors or MTX. The study was restricted to new users. We computed within-person change in each measure, so that each patient served as their own control. In addition, we compared TNF inhibitor patients to MTX patients, by computing the adjusted difference in their group means. In secondary analyses, we examined phototherapy as a comparator. Among starters of TNF inhibitor and MTX therapy, within-person change in physiologic measures at 6 months did not differ significantly. We observed no important or significant changes in any of the physiologic measures with initiation of TNF inhibitor compared with MTX. The same results were found in subgroup analyses focused on men, and on those with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or obesity. The same results were observed with phototherapy, except that diastolic blood pressure declined by 0.6 mmHg within person during the 6 months after starting phototherapy (P < 0.05). The study provides no evidence for improvement of physiologic measures associated with the metabolic syndrome resulting from TNF 2013-11-07. Identifying profiles of recovery from reward devaluation in rats. In humans and other mammals, the unexpected loss of a resource can lead to emotional conflict. Consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC) is a laboratory model of reward devaluation meant to capture that conflict. In this paradigm, animals are exposed to a sharp reduction in the sucrose concentration of a solution after several days of access. This downshift in sucrose content leads to behavioral responses such as the suppression of consumption and physiologic responses including elevation of corticosterone levels. However, response heterogeneity in cSNC has yet to be explored and may be relevant for increasing the validity of this model, as humans demonstrate clinically meaningful heterogeneity in response to resource loss. The current analysis applied latent growth mixture modeling to test for and characterize heterogeneity in recovery from cSNC among rats (N=262). Although most animals exhibited recovery of consummatory behavior after a sharp drop in consumption in the first postshift trial (Recovery class; 83%), two additional classes were identified including animals that did not change their consumption levels after downshift (No Contrast class; 6%), and animals that exhibited an initial response similar to that of the Recovery class but did not recover to preshift consumption levels (No Recovery class; 11%). These results indicate heterogeneity in recovery from reward loss among rats, which may increase the translatability of this animal model to understand diverse responses to loss among humans.

Association of African genetic ancestry with fasting glucose and HbA1c levels in non-diabetic individuals: the Boston Area Community Health (BACH) Prediabetes Study To test among diabetes-free urban community-dwelling adults the hypothesis that the proportion of African genetic ancestry is positively associated with glycaemia, after accounting for other continental ancestry proportions, BMI and socioeconomic status (SES). The Boston Area Community Health cohort is a multi-stage 1:1:1 stratified random sample of self-identified African-American, Hispanic and white adults from three Boston inner city areas. We measured 62 ancestry informative markers, fasting glucose (FG), HbA1c, BMI and SES (income, education, occupation and insurance status) and analysed 1,387 eligible individuals (379 African-American, 411 Hispanic, 597 white) without clinical or biochemical evidence of diabetes. We used three-heritage multinomial linear regression models to test the association of FG or HbA1c with genetic ancestry proportion adjusted for: (1) age and sex; (2) age, sex and BMI; and (3) age, sex, BMI and SES. Mean age- and sex-adjusted FG levels were 5.73 and 5.54 mmol/l among those with 100% African or European ancestry, respectively. Using per cent European ancestry as the referent, each 1% increase in African ancestry proportion was associated with an age- and sex-adjusted FG increase of 0.0019 mmol/l (p = 0.01). In the BMI- and SES-adjusted model the slope was 0.0019 (p = 0.02). Analysis of HbA1c gave similar results. A greater proportion of African genetic ancestry is independently associated with higher FG levels in a non-diabetic community-based cohort, even accounting for other ancestry proportions, obesity and SES. The results suggest that differences between African-Americans and whites in type 2 diabetes risk may include genetically mediated differences in glucose 2014 Sep;40(9):1568. Update on Health Literacy and Diabetes Inadequate literacy is common among patients with diabetes and may lead to adverse outcomes. The authors reviewed the relationship between literacy and health outcomes in patients with diabetes and potential interventions to improve outcomes. We reviewed 79 articles covering 3 key domains: (1) evaluation of screening tools to identify inadequate literacy and numeracy, (2) the relationships of a range of diabetes-related health outcomes with literacy and numeracy, and (3) interventions to reduce literacy-related differences in health outcomes. Several screening tools are available to assess patients' print literacy and numeracy skills, some specifically addressing diabetes. Literacy and numeracy are consistently associated with diabetes-related knowledge. Some studies suggest literacy and numeracy are associated with intermediate outcomes, including self-efficacy, communication, and self-care (including adherence), but the relationship between literacy and glycemic control is mixed. Few studies have assessed more distal health outcomes, including diabetes-related complications, health care utilization, safety, or quality of life, but available studies suggest low literacy may be associated with increased risk of complications, including hypoglycemia. Several interventions appear to be effective in improving diabetes-related outcomes regardless of literacy status, but it is unclear if these interventions can reduce literacy-related differences in outcomes. Low literacy is associated with less diabetes-related knowledge and may be related to other important health outcomes. Further studies are needed to better elucidate pathways by which literacy skills affect health outcomes. Promising interventions are available to improve diabetes outcomes for patients with low literacy; more research is needed to determine their effectiveness outside of research settings.

Hospital readmission and healthcare utilization following sepsis in community settings Sepsis, the most expensive cause of hospitalization in the United States, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, healthcare utilization patterns following sepsis are poorly understood. To identify patient-level factors that contribute to postsepsis mortality and healthcare utilization. A retrospective study of sepsis patients drawn from 21 community-based hospitals in Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2010. We determined 1-year survival and use of outpatient and facility-based healthcare before and after sepsis and used logistic regression to identify the factors that contributed to early readmission (within 30 days) and high utilization (? 15% of living days spent in facility-based care). Among 6344 sepsis patients, 5479 (86.4%) survived to hospital discharge. Mean age was 72 years with 28.9% of patients aged <65 years. Postsepsis survival was strongly modified by age; 1-year survival was 94.1% for <45 year olds and 54.4% for ? 85 year olds. A total of 978 (17.9%) patients were readmitted within 30 days; only a minority of all rehospitalizations were for infection. After sepsis, adjusted healthcare utilization increased nearly 3-fold compared with presepsis levels and was strongly modified by age. Patient factors including acute severity of illness, hospital length of stay, and the need for intensive care were associated with early readmission and high healthcare utilization; however, the dominant factors explaining variability-comorbid disease burden and high presepsis utilization-were present prior to sepsis admission. Postsepsis survival and healthcare utilization were most strongly influenced by patient factors already present prior to sepsis hospitalization. Authors: Associations Between Antidepressant Adherence and Shared Decision-Making, Patient-Provider Trust, and Communication Among Adults with Diabetes: Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) Depression and adherence to antidepressant treatment are important clinical concerns in diabetes care. While patient-provider communication patterns have been associated with adherence for cardiometabolic medications, it is unknown whether interpersonal aspects of care impact antidepressant medication adherence. To determine whether shared decision-making, patient-provider trust, or communication are associated with early stage and ongoing antidepressant adherence. Observational new prescription cohort study. Kaiser Permanente Northern California. One thousand five hundred twenty-three adults with type 2 diabetes who completed a survey in 2006 and received a new antidepressant prescription during 2006-2010. Exposures included items based on the Trust in Physicians and Interpersonal Processes of Care instruments and the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) communication scale. Measures of adherence were estimated using validated methods with physician prescribing and pharmacy dispensing data: primary non-adherence (medication never dispensed), early non-persistence (dispensed once, never refilled), and new prescription medication gap (NPMG; proportion of time without medication during 12 months after initial prescription). After adjusting for potential confounders, patients' perceived lack of shared decision-making was significantly non-adherence (RR?=?1.34, p?0.01) greater gap in medication supply, p?0.01). Less trust in provider was significantly associated with early non-persistence (RRs 1.22-1.25, ps?0.05) and NPMG (estimated NPMG differences 5-8%, ps?0.01). All patients were insured and had consistent access to and quality of care. Patients' perceptions of their relationships with providers, including lack of shared decision-making or trust, demonstrated strong associations with antidepressant non-adherence. Further research should explore whether interventions for healthcare providers and systems that foster shared decision-making and trust might also improve medication adherence.

Pharmacotherapy for Incident Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Practice Patterns and Quality Metrics This study examines incident treatment patterns for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children seen in eight integrated healthcare delivery systems and identifies factors associated with adherence to Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures developed by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). A retrospective cohort analysis using electronic healthcare data from children aged 3 through 17 years with newly diagnosed ADHD between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010 was conducted. NCQA quality definitions for initiation and for continuation and maintenance (C&M) of ADHD medications were expanded to include preschoolers and adolescents. Poisson regression models with robust error variance were used to evaluate the association between NCQA HEDIS adherence measures, provider type, patient characteristics and care process measures. Of 6864 children aged 3-17 years old qualifying for incident treatment analyses, 5538 (80.7%) were started on ADHD medication within a year of diagnosis. Adherence to NCQA HEDIS measures was 49.8% for initiation and 45.8% for C&M, with adherence rates higher for mental health than non-mental health providers, school-aged children than adolescents, and for patients concurrently on other psychotropic medications than those who were not. Of those started on ADHD medication, 62.3% were not eligible for C&M analyses according to HEDIS guidelines, because they did not receive continuous (210 of 300 days) ADHD medication treatment, with adolescents less likely than school-aged children to persist with medications. Study limitations must be considered, including reliance on electronic medical record data, absence of patient race and sociodemographic data, and limited generalizability to other care contexts. Nevertheless, findings suggest novel strategies are needed to improve the quality of ADHD care processes for children of all ages, because even within integrated delivery systems less than half of children with ADHD received care consistent with NCQA HEDIS standards for initiation and C&M care. RESULTS suggest the need to refine quality measures by including follow-up care in those children not receiving or discontinuing medication treatment, a considerable quality concern not currently captured in NCQA HEDIS standards.

Combining Immature and Total Neutrophil Counts to Predict Early Onset Sepsis in Term and Late Preterm Newborns: Use of the I/T2 The absolute neutrophil count and the immature/total neutrophil ratio (I/T) provide information about the risk of early onset sepsis in newborns. However, it is not clear how to combine their potentially overlapping information into a single likelihood ratio. We obtained electronic records of blood cultures and of complete blood counts with manual differentials drawn <1 hour apart on 66,846 infants ? 34 weeks gestation and <72 hours of age born at Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Brigham and Women's Hospitals. We hypothesized that dividing the immature neutrophil count (I) by the total neutrophil count (T) squared (I/T) would provide a useful summary of the risk of infection. We evaluated the ability of the I/T to discriminate newborns with pathogenic bacteremia from other newborns tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (c). Discrimination of the I/T (c = 0.79; 95% confidence interval: 0.76-0.82) was similar to that of logistic models with indicator variables for each of 24 combinations of the absolute neutrophil count and the proportion of immature neutrophils (c = 0.80, 95% confidence interval: 0.77-0.83). Discrimination of the I/T improved with age, from 0.70 at <1 hour to 0.87 at ? 4 hours. However, 60% of I/T had likelihood ratios of 0.44-1.3, thus only minimally altering the pretest odds of disease. Calculating the I/T could enhance prediction of early onset sepsis, but the complete blood counts will remain helpful mainly when done at >4 hours of age and when the pretest probability of infection is close to the treatment threshold.

Maternal Acculturation and the Prenatal Care Experience Acculturation may influence women's perceptions of health care experiences and may explain the epidemiologic paradox, whereby foreign-born women have lower rates of adverse birth outcomes than United States (US)-born women. We evaluated the relationship between maternal acculturation and specific dimensions of prenatal interpersonal processes of care (IPC) in ethnically diverse women. Cross-sectional analysis of 1243 multiethnic, postpartum women who delivered at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Walnut Creek or San Francisco General Hospital. Women retrospectively reported on their experiences in seven domains of IPC during their pregnancy pertaining to communication, decision making, and interpersonal style. The primary independent variables were four measures of maternal acculturation: birthplace, English language proficiency, the number of years residing in the US, and age at immigration to the US. Generalized linear models, stratified by infant outcome, measured the association between each maternal acculturation measure and specific IPC domains while adjusting for type of health insurance, demographic, and reproductive factors. Approximately 60% of the sample was foreign-born, 36% reported low English proficiency, 43% had resided in the US <10 years, and 35% were age 20 years or older when they immigrated to the US. Over 64% of the women reported having public insurance during pregnancy. In adjusted analyses among women who delivered term and normal birth weight infants, less acculturated women and women with non-private health insurance were more likely to have higher mean IPC scores when compared to more acculturated or US-born women and women with private health insurance, respectively. In a large and ethnically diverse sample of childbearing women in Northern California, less acculturated pregnant women reported better prenatal care experiences than more acculturated and US-born women, another dimension of the \"epidemiologic paradox.\" However, the relationship between acculturation and IPC, as reported during the postpartum period, differed according to infant outcomes.

Changes in Use of Lipid-lowering Medications Among Black and White Dual Enrollees With Diabetes Transitioning From Medicaid to Medicare Part D Drug Coverage The use of lipid-lowering agents is suboptimal among dual enrollees, particularly blacks. To determine whether the removal of restrictive drug caps under Medicare Part D reduced racial differences among dual enrollees with diabetes. An interrupted time series with comparison series design (ITS) cohort study. A total of 8895 black and white diabetes patients aged 18 years and older drawn from a nationally representative sample of fee-for-service dual enrollees (January 2004-December 2007) in states with and without drug caps before Part D. We examined the monthly (1) proportion of patients with any use of lipid-lowering therapies; and (2) intensity of use. Stratification measures included age (less than 65, 65 y and older), race (white vs. black), and sex. At baseline, lipid-lowering drug use was higher in no drug cap states (drug cap: 54.0% vs. nondrug cap: 66.8%) and among whites vs. 44.9%, no drug cap: 68.4% vs. 61.9%). In strict drug cap states only, Part D was associated with an increase in the proportion with any use [nonelderly: +0.07 absolute percentage +0.08 (0.06-0.10), P<0.001] regardless of race. However, we found no evidence of a change in the white-black gap in the proportion of users despite the removal of a significant financial barrier. Medicare Part D was associated with increased use of lipid-lowering drugs, but racial gaps persisted. Understanding non-coverage-related barriers is critical in maximizing the potential benefits of coverage expansions for disparities reduction. Authors: Adams AS; Med Care. 2014 Aug;52(8):695-703. Hospital Deaths in Patients With Sepsis From 2 Independent Cohorts Authors: Liu V; Jul Prescription medication burden in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes: A SUrveillance, PREvention, and ManagEment of Diabetes Mellitus (SUPREME-DM) study To understand the burden of medication use for patients with newly diagnosed diabetes both before and after diabetes diagnosis and to identify subpopulations of patients with newly diagnosed diabetes who face a relatively high drug burden. Retrospective cohort study. 11 integrated health systems in the United States. 196,654 insured adults 20 years of age or older newly diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes from January 2005 through December 2009. Number of unique therapeutic classes of drugs dispensed in the 12 months before and 12 months after diagnosis of diabetes in five categories: overall, antihypertensive agents, antihyperlipidemic agents, mental health agents, and antihyperglycemic agents (in the postdiagnosis period only). The mean number of drug classes used by newly diagnosed patients with diabetes is high before diagnosis (5.0) and increases significantly afterward (6.6). Of this increase, 81% is due to antihyperglycemic initiation and increased use of medications to control hypertension and lipid levels. Multivariate analyses showed that overall drug burden after diabetes diagnosis was higher in women, older, white, and obese patients, as well as among those with higher glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations and comorbidity levels (significant for all comparisons). The overall number of drug classes used by newly diagnosed patients with diabetes after diagnosis decreased slightly but significantly between 2005 and 2009. Patients newly diagnosed with diabetes face a substantially increased burden of medications used to control diabetes and other comorbidities. This study shows an increased focus on cardiovascular disease risk factor control after diagnosis of diabetes. However, total drug burden may be slightly decreasing over time.

Intensification of antihyperglycemic therapy among patients with incident diabetes: a Surveillance Prevention and Management of Diabetes Mellitus (SUPREME-DM) study Antihyperglycemic medication intensification practices among patients with incident diabetes are incompletely understood. We characterized the first intensification the year after oral antihyperglycemic medication initiation among incident diabetes patients. This retrospective cohort study across 11 US health systems included adults identified with incident diabetes between 2005 and 2009 who started oral antihyperglycemic monotherapy or combination therapy within 6?months after diabetes identification. We determined intensification, defined as increased index medication dosage, addition of another oral medication, or switch to/addition of insulin 31-365?days after initial antihyperglycemic dispensing. Cox regression was used to assess intensification for patient, temporal, and system covariates, adjusting for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as a time-dependent variable. Among 41,233 patients, 33.5% and 45.3% had treatment intensified within 6 and 12?months, respectively. This first intensification was most often with increased index medication dosage (78%), least often with insulin (<1%). HbA1c% was strongly associated with intensification (adjusted hazard ratios [HR] 1.59, 3.62, 4.44, ?8%, respectively, all P?0.001, compared with HbA1c?6.5%). In patients initially on monotherapy, age modified the HbA1c effect: at HbA1c?7%, the HR differed little between middle-aged and older patients; at HbA1c???7%, the HR decreased with older age (e.g., age 40-49?years and HbA1c???8%: HR 8.14; age???80?years and achieved HbA1c?8%; 65.1% achieved HbA1c?7%. Clinicians appear to be applying treatment intensification guidelines and individualizing therapy by considering patient age, achieving glycemic control among most incident diabetes patients. Individualizing HbA1c targets for patients with diabetes: impact of an automated algorithm within a primary care network To develop glycaemic goal individualization algorithms and assess potential impact on a healthcare system and different segments of the population with diabetes. A cross-sectional observational study of patients with diabetes in a primary care network age > 18 years with an HbA1c measured between 1 January and 31 December 2011. We applied diabetes guidelines to create targeted algorithms 1 and 2, which assigned HbA1c goals based on age, duration of diabetes (< 15 years or < 10 years), diabetes complications and Charlson co-morbidity score (< 6 or < 4) [targeted algorithm 2 was designed to assign more patients a goal < 64 mmol/mol (8.0%) than targeted algorithm 1]. Each patient's HbA1c was compared with these targeted goals and to the 'standard' goal < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). Agreement was tested using McNemar's test. Overall, 55.7% of 12 199 patients would be considered controlled under the 'standard' approach, 61.2% under targeted algorithm 1 and 67.5% under targeted algorithm 2. Targeted algorithm 1 reclassified 1213 (23.6%) patients considered uncontrolled under the standard approach to controlled, P < 0.001. Targeted algorithm 2 reclassified 1844 (35.2%) patients, P < 0.001. Compared with those controlled under the standard goal, there was no significant difference in the proportion of those controlled using targeted goals who had Medicaid, had less than a high school diploma or received primary care in a federally qualified health centre. Two automated targeted algorithms would reclassify one quarter to one third of patients from uncontrolled to controlled within a primary care network without differentially affecting vulnerable patient subgroups.

Increased one-year health care utilization in survivors of severe sepsis Hospitalizations for severe sepsis are common, and a growing number of patients survive to hospital discharge. Nonetheless, little is known about survivors' post-discharge healthcare use. To measure inpatient healthcare use of severe sepsis survivors compared with patients' own presepsis resource use and the resource use of survivors of otherwise similar nonsepsis hospitalizations. This is an observational cohort study of survivors of severe sepsis and nonsepsis hospitalizations identified from participants in the Health and Retirement Study with linked Medicare claims, 1998-2005. We matched severe sepsis and nonsepsis hospitalizations by demographics, comorbidity burden, premorbid disability, hospitalization length, and intensive care use. Using Medicare claims, we measured patients' use of inpatient facilities (hospitals, long-term acute care hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities) in the 2 years surrounding hospitalization. Severe sepsis survivors spent more days (median, 16 [interquartile range, 3-45] vs. 7 [0-29]; P < 0.001) and a higher proportion of days alive (median, 9.6% [interquartile range, 1.4-33.8%] vs. 1.9% [0.0-7.9%]; P < 0.001) admitted to facilities in the year after hospitalization, compared with the year prior. The increase in facility-days was similar for nonsepsis hospitalizations. However, the severe sepsis cohort experienced greater post-discharge mortality (44.2% [95% confidence interval, 41.3-47.2%] vs. 31.4% [95% confidence interval, 28.6-34.2%] at 1 year), a steeper decline in days spent at home (difference-in-differences, -38.6 d [95% confidence interval, -50.9 to 26.3]; P < 0.001), and a greater increase in the proportion of days alive spent in a facility (difference-in-differences, 5.4% [95% confidence interval, 2.8-8.1%]; P < 0.001). Healthcare use is markedly elevated after severe sepsis, and post-discharge management may be an opportunity to reduce resource use. Prescott HC; Langa Respir Crit Care Med. 2014 Jul 1;190(1):62-9. Implications of different laboratory-based incident diabetic kidney disease definitions on comparative effectiveness studies Comparative effectiveness studies using electronic health records (EHRs) often define chronic kidney disease (CKD) outcomes using laboratory-based definitions. Recommendations for defining CKD require multiple longitudinal measurements. The implications of applying these definitions to EHR data are poorly understood. Using a cohort of 36,025 individuals with diabetes from three health systems who initiated a new glucose-lowering medication, we compared concordance and CKD incidence rates and rate ratios for glucose-lowering medication classes for laboratory-based CKD definitions requiring one versus multiple abnormal tests. CKD incidence rates differed more than twofold based on the definition. Reassuring for CER, incidence rate ratios for glucose-lowering medication classes on risk of developing CKD were relatively unaffected by CKD definition.

Non-visit-based cancer screening using a novel population management system Advances in information technology (IT) now permit population-based preventive screening, but the best methods remain uncertain. We evaluated whether involving primary care providers (PCPs) in a visit-independent population management IT application led to more effective cancer screening. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial involving 18 primary care practice sites and 169 PCPs from June 15, 2011, to June 14, 2012. Participants included adults eligible for breast, cervical, and/or colorectal cancer screening. In practices randomized to the intervention group, PCPs reviewed real-time rosters of their patients overdue for screening and provided individualized contact (via a letter, practice delegate, or patient navigator) or deferred screening (temporarily or permanently). In practices randomized to the comparison group, overdue patients were automatically sent reminder letters and transferred to practice delegate lists for follow-up. Intervention patients without PCP action within 8 weeks defaulted to the automated control version. The primary outcome was adjusted average cancer screening completion rates over 1-year follow-up, accounting for clustering by physician or practice. Baseline cancer screening rates (80.8% vs 80.3%) were similar among patients in the intervention (n = 51,071) and comparison group (n = 52,799). Most intervention providers used the IT application (88 of 101, 87%) and users reviewed 7984 patients overdue for at least 1 cancer screening (73% sent reminder letter, 6% referred directly to a practice delegate or patient navigator, and 21% deferred screening). In addition, 6128 letters were automatically sent to patients in the intervention group (total of 12,002 letters vs 16,378 letters in comparison practices; P < .001). Adjusted average cancer screening rates did not differ among intervention and comparison practices for all cancers combined (81.6% vs 81.4%; P = .84) nor breast (82.7% vs 82.7%; P = .96), cervical (84.1% vs 84.7%; P = .60), or colorectal cancer (77.8% vs 76.2%; P = .33). Involving PCPs in a visit-independent population management IT application resulted in similar cancer screening rates compared with an automated reminder system, but fewer patients were sent reminder letters. This suggests that PCPs were able to identify and exclude from contact patients who would have received automated reminder letters but not undergone screening.

National Trends in US Hospital Admissions for Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia Among Medicare Beneficiaries, 1999 to 2011 The increasing intensity of diabetes mellitus management over the past decade may have resulted in lower rates of hyperglycemic emergencies but higher rates of hospital admissions for hypoglycemia among older adults. Trends in these hospitalizations and subsequent outcomes are not known. To characterize changes in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia hospitalization rates and subsequent mortality and readmission rates among older adults in the United States over a 12-year period, and to compare these results according to age, sex, and race. Retrospective observational study using data from 33,952,331 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries 65 years or older from 1999 to 2011. Hospitalization rates for hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, 30-day and 1-year mortality rates, and 30-day readmission rates. A total of 279,937 patients experienced 302,095 hospitalizations for hyperglycemia, and 404,467 patients experienced 429,850 hospitalizations for hypoglycemia between 1999 and 2011. During this time, rates of admissions for hyperglycemia declined by 38.6% (from 114 to 70 admissions per 100,000 person-years), while admissions for hypoglycemia increased by 11.7% (from 94 to 105 admissions per 100,000 person-years). In analyses designed to account for changing diabetes mellitus prevalence, admissions for hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia declined by 55.2% and 9.5%, respectively. Trends were similar across age, sex, and racial subgroups, but hypoglycemia rates were 2-fold higher for older patients (?75 years) when compared with younger patients (65-74 years), and admission rates for both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia were 4-fold higher for black patients compared with white patients. The 30-day and 1-year mortality and 30-day readmission rates improved during the study period and were similar after an index hospitalization for either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia (5.4%, 17.1%, and 15.3%, in 2010; 4.4%, 19.9%, and 16.3% after hypoglycemia hospitalizations). Hospital admission rates for hypoglycemia now exceed those for hyperglycemia among older adults. Although admissions for hypoglycemia have declined modestly since 2007, rates among black Medicare beneficiaries and those older than 75 years remain high. Hospital admissions for severe hypoglycemia seem to pose a greater health threat than those for hyperglycemia, suggesting new opportunities for improvement in care of persons with diabetes mellitus.

Developing a data infrastructure for a learning health system: the PORTAL network The Kaiser Permanente & Strategic Partners Patient Outcomes Research To Advance Learning (PORTAL) network engages four healthcare delivery systems (Kaiser Permanente, Group Health Cooperative, HealthPartners, and Denver Health) and their affiliated research centers to create a new national network infrastructure that builds on existing relationships among these institutions. PORTAL is enhancing its current capabilities by expanding the scope of the common data model, paying particular attention to incorporating patient-reported data more systematically, implementing new multi-site data governance procedures, and integrating the PCORnet PopMedNet platform across our research centers. PORTAL is partnering with clinical research and patient experts to create cohorts of patients with a common diagnosis (colorectal cancer), a rare diagnosis (adolescents and adults with severe congenital heart disease), and adults who are overweight or obese, including those with pre-diabetes or diabetes, to conduct large-scale observational comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials across diverse clinical care settings.

Bleeding complications of central venous catheterization in septic patients with abnormal hemostasis Central venous catheterization (CVC) is thought to be relatively contraindicated in patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy. We measured the 24-hour incidence of bleeding in septic emergency department (ED) patients undergoing CVC. This multicenter, retrospective cohort study included septic ED patients undergoing CVC with one of the following: platelets less than 100,000/?L, international normalized ratio at least 1.3, or partial thromboplastin time at least 35 seconds. Major bleeding included radiographically confirmed intrathoracic, mediastinal, or internal neck hemorrhage or line-related bleeding causing hemodynamic compromise. Minor bleeding included local oozing or superficial hematoma. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine the association between candidate variables and hemorrhagic complications. Of the 936 cases, mean age was 68.1 years; 535 (57.2%) were male. Two or more qualifying laboratory abnormalities were present in 204 cases (21.8%). The proceduralists were predominately attendings (790; 84.4%). The initial were the internal 800; 85.5%), subclavian femoral (n = 13; 1.4%). Initial access was successful in 872 cases (93.2%). We found one case (95% upper confidence limit: 0.6%) of major bleeding and 37 cases (4.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8%-5.4%) of minor bleeding. Only failed access at the initial site was independently associated with hemorrhagic outcomes: adjusted odds ratio 8.2 (95% CI, 3.7-18.0). Major bleeding from CVC in ED patients with abnormal hemostasis is rare. Minor bleeding is uncommon and infrequently requires intervention. Successful catheterization on the initial attempt is associated with fewer hemorrhagic complications. These results can inform the risk/benefit calculus for CVC in this population.

Initial Persistence With Antihypertensive Therapies Is Associated With Depression Treatment Persistence, But Not Depression The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the presence of clinical depression and persistence to drug therapy treatment for depression with early nonpersistence to antihypertensive therapies in a large, diverse cohort of newly treated hypertension patients. Using a hypertension registry at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, the authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of 44,167 adults (18 years and older) with hypertension who were new users of antihypertensive therapy in 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to model the relationships between the presence of clinical depression and early nonpersistence (defined as failing to refill the first prescription within 90 days after the end of the first fill days' supply) to antihypertensive therapies, controlling for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors. Within the group of 1484 patients who had evidence of clinical depression in the 12 months prior to the initiation of antihypertensive therapy, the authors examined the relationship between drug therapy treatment for depression and 6-month persistence with antidepressant therapy with early nonpersistence with antihypertensive therapies. No association was found between the presence of clinical depression and early nonpersistence to antihypertensive therapies after adjustment for individual demographic and clinical characteristics and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status. However, among the subset of 1484 patients with documented evidence of clinical depression in the 12 months prior to the initiation of antihypertensive therapy, being prescribed and persistence with antidepressant therapy was strongly associated with lower odds of early nonpersistence to antihypertensive medications (odds ratio, 0.64; confidence interval, 0.42-0.96). In an integrated delivery system, the authors found that treatment for depression was associated with higher levels of antihypertensive persistence. Improving quality of depression care in patients with comorbid hypertension may be an important strategy in decreasing cardiovascular disease risk in these patients. Authors: From diagnosis health-care experiences of colorectal cancer survivors with ostomies The journey from diagnosis through treatment to survivorship can be challenging for colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors with permanent ostomies. Memories of both the positive and negative health-care interactions can persist years after the initial diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this paper is to describe the health-care experiences of long-term (>5 years) CRC survivors with ostomies. Thirty-three CRC survivors with ostomies who were members of Kaiser Permanente, an integrated care organization, in Oregon, southwestern Washington and northern California participated in eight focus groups. Discussions from the focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for potential categories and themes. Health-care-related themes described CRC survivors' experiences with diagnosis, treatment decision-making, initial experiences with ostomy, and survivorship. Participants discussed both positive and negative health-care-related experiences, including the need for continued access to trained nurses for ostomy self-care, access to peer support, and resources related to managing persistent, debilitating symptoms. Long-term CRC survivors with ostomies have both positive and negative health-care experiences, regardless of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and gender. Long-term support mechanisms and quality survivorship care that CRC survivors with ostomies can access are needed to promote positive adjustments and improved HRQOL. The current literature in CRC survivorship suggests that HRQOL concerns can persist years after treatment completion. The coordination of care to manage persistent late- and long-term effects are still lacking for CRC survivors living with an ostomy. Findings from this qualitative analysis will aid in the development of support strategies that foster more positive adjustments for CRC survivors living with an ostomy and support their ongoing Epub 2014-01-19. Emergency Physician Perspectives on Central Venous Catheterization in the Emergency Department: A Survey-based Study The objective was to assess clinician experience, training, and attitudes toward central venous catheterization (CVC) in adult emergency department (ED) patients in a health system promoting increased utilization of CVC for severely septic ED patients. The authors surveyed all emergency physicians (EPs) within a 21-hospital integrated health care delivery system that had recently instituted a modified Rivers protocol for providing early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) to patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, including CVC if indicated. This initiative was accompanied by a structured, but optional, systemwide hands-on training for EPs in real-time ultrasound-guided CVC (US CVC). EPs' responses to questions regarding self-reported experience with CVC in the ED are reported. Data included frequency of CVC (by type) and US CVC training opportunities: both during and after residency and informal (\"on-the-job training involving actual ED patients under the oversight of someone more experienced than yourself\") and formal (\"off-the-job training not involving actual ED patients\"). The survey also asked respondents to report their comfort levels with different types of CVC as well as their agreement with possible barriers (philosophical, time-related, equipment-related, and complication-related) to CVC in the ED. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression was used to identify provider characteristics and responses associated with higher yearly CVC volumes. The survey response rate among eligible participants was 365 of 465 (78%). Overall, 154 of 365 (42%) respondents reported performing 11 or more CVCs a year, while 46 of 365 (13%) reported doing two or fewer. Concerning CVC techniques, 271 of 358 (76%) of respondents reported being comfortable with the internal jugular approach with US guidance, compared to 200 of 345 (58%) with the subclavian approach without US. Training rates were reported as 1) in residency, formal 167 of 358 (47%) and informal 189 of 364 (52%); and 2) postresidency, formal 236 of 359 (66%) and informal 260 of 365 (71%). The most commonly self-reported barriers to CVC were procedural time (56%) and complication risk (61%). After multivariate adjustment, the following were significantly associated with greater self-reported CVC use (p < 0.01): 1) informal bedside CVC training after residency, 2) male sex, 3) disagreement with complication-related barrier questions, and 4) self-reported comfort with placing US-guided internal jugular catheters. In this cross-sectional survey-based study, EPs reported varying experience with CVC in the ED and reported high comfort with the US CVC technique. Postresidency informal training experience, male sex, negative responses to complication-related barrier questions, and comfort with placing US-guided internal jugular catheters were associated with yearly CVC volume. These results suggest that higher rates of CVC in eligible patients might be achieved by informal training programs in US and/or by disseminating existing evidence about the low risk of complications associated with the procedure.

Results from the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes Study To compare the strength of the association between depression and mortality between elderly and younger individuals with diabetes mellitus. A survival analysis conducted in a longitudinal cohort study of persons with diabetes mellitus to test the association between depression and mortality in older (? 65) and younger (18-65) adults. Managed care. Persons aged 18 and older with diabetes mellitus who participated in the Wave 2 survey of the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) Study (N = 3,341). The primary outcome was mortality risk, which was measured as days until death using linked data from the National Death Index. Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire. After controlling for age, sex, race and ethnicity, income, and other comorbidities, mortality risk in persons with diabetes mellitus was 49% higher in those with depression than in those without, although results varied according to age. After controlling for the same variables, mortality risk in persons aged 65 and older with depression was 78% greater than in those without. For those younger than 65, the effect of depression on mortality was smaller and not statistically significant. This analysis suggests that the effect of depression on mortality in persons with diabetes mellitus is most significant for older adults. Because there is evidence in the literature that treatment of depression in elderly adults can lead to lower mortality, these results may suggest that older adults with diabetes mellitus should be considered a high-priority population for depression screening Jun;62(6):1017-22.

Low Socioeconomic Status is Associated with Increased Risk for Hypoglycemia in Diabetes Patients: The Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) Social risk factors for hypoglycemia are not well understood. Cross-sectional analysis from the DISTANCE study, a multi-language, ethnically-stratified random sample of adults in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California diabetes registry, conducted in 2005-2006 (response rate 62%). Exposures were income and educational attainment; outcome was patient report of severe hypoglycemia. To test the association, we used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for demographic and clinical factors. 14,357 patients were included. Reports of severe hypoglycemia were common (11%), and higher in low-income vs. high-income (16% vs. 8.8) low-education vs. high-education (11.9% vs. 8.9%) groups. In multivariable 1.51 95%CI 1.19-1.91), $15,000-$24,999 (OR 1.57 95%CI 1.27-1.94), and high school or less education (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.24-1.63) were associated with increased hypoglycemia, similar to insulin use (OR 1.44 95%CI 1.19-1.74). Low income and educational attainment are important J Poor Underserved. 2014 May;25(2):478-90. Promotion of Lung Health: NHLBI Workshop on the Primary Prevention of Chronic Lung Diseases Lung-related research primarily focuses on the etiology and management of diseases. In recent years, interest in primary prevention has grown. However, primary prevention also includes \"health promotion\" (actions in a population that keep an individual healthy). We encourage more research on population-based (public health) strategies that could not only maximize lung health but also mitigate \"normal\" age-related declines-not only for spirometry but across multiple measures of lung health. In developing a successful strategy, a \"life course\" approach is important. Unfortunately, we are unable to achieve the full benefit of this approach until we have better measures of lung health and an improved understanding of the normal trajectory, both over an individual's life span and possibly across generations. We discuss key questions in lung health promotion, with an emphasis on the upper (healthier) end of the distribution of lung functioning and resiliency and briefly summarize the few interventions that have been studied to date. We conclude with suggestions regarding the most promising future research for this important, but largely neglected, area of lung research. Authors: Suppl 3:S125-38. Accuracy of hospital standardized mortality rates: effects of model calibration Risk-adjusted mortality rates are commonly used in quality report cards to compare hospital performance. The risk adjustment depends on models that are assessed for goodness-of-fit using various discrimination and calibration measures. However, the relationship between model fit and the accuracy of hospital comparisons is not well characterized. To evaluate the impact of imperfect model calibration (miscalibration) on the accuracy of hospital comparisons. We constructed Monte Carlo simulations where a risk-adjustment model is used in a population with a different mortality distribution than in the original model. We estimated the power of calibration metrics to detect miscalibration. We estimated the sensitivity and specificity of a hospital comparisons method under different imperfect model calibration scenarios using an empirical method. The U-statistics showed the highest power to detect intercept and slope deviations in the calibration curve, followed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow, and the calibration intercept and slope tests. The specificity decreased with increased intercept and slope deviations and with hospital size. The effect of an imperfect model fit on sensitivity is a function of the true standardized mortality ratio, the underlying mortality rate, sample size, and observed intercept and slope deviations. Poorly performing hospitals can appear as good performers and vice versa, depending on the deviation magnitude and direction. Deviations from perfect model calibration have a direct impact on the accuracy of hospital comparisons. Publishing the calibration intercept and slope of risk-adjustment models would allow the users to monitor their performance against the true standard population.

An electronic order set for acute myocardial infarction is associated with improved patient outcomes through better adherence to clinical practice guidelines Adherence to evidence-based recommendations for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains unsatisfactory. Quantifying association between using an electronic AMI order set (AMI-OS) and hospital processes and outcomes. Retrospective cohort study. Twenty-one community hospitals. A total of 5879 AMI patients were hospitalized between September 28, 2008 and December 31, 2010. We ascertained whether patients were treated using the AMI-OS or individual orders (a la carte). Dependent process variables were use of evidence-based care; outcome variables were mortality and rehospitalization. Use of individual and combined therapies improved outcomes (eg, 50% lower odds of 30-day mortality for patients with ?3 therapies). The 3531 patients treated using the AMI-OS were more likely to receive evidence-based therapies (eg, 50% received 5 different therapies vs 36% a la carte). These patients had lower 30-day mortality (5.7% vs 8.5%) than the 2348 treated using a la carte orders. Although AMI-OS patients' predicted mortality risk was lower (3.2%) than that of a la carte patients (4.8%), the association of improved processes and outcomes with the use of the AMI-OS persisted after risk adjustment. For example, after inverse probability weighting, the relative risk for inpatient mortality in the AMI-OS group was 0.67 (95% confidence interval: 0.52-0.86). Inclusion of use of recommended therapies in risk adjustment eliminated the benefit of the AMI-OS, highlighting its mediating effect on adherence to evidence-based treatment. Use of an electronic order set is associated with increased adherence to evidence-based care and better AMI outcomes. Authors: Ballesca MA; Effects of Medicare Part D on Guideline-Concordant Pharmacotherapy for Bipolar I Disorder Among Dual Beneficiaries In January 2006 insurance coverage for medications shifted from Medicaid to Medicare Part D private drug plans for the six million individuals enrolled in both programs. Dual beneficiaries faced new formularies and utilization management policies. It is unclear whether Part D, compared with Medicaid, relaxed or tightened psychiatric medication management, which could affect receipt of recommended pharmacotherapy, and emergency department use related to treatment discontinuities. This study examined the impact of the transition from Medicaid to Part D on guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy for bipolar I disorder and emergency department use. Using interrupted-time-series analysis and Medicaid and Medicare administrative data from 2004 to 2007, the authors analyzed the effect of the coverage transition on receipt of guideline-concordant antimanic medication, guideline-discordant antidepressant monotherapy, and emergency department visits for a nationally representative continuous cohort of 1,431 adults with diagnosed bipolar I disorder. Sixteen months after the transition to Part D, the proportion of the population with any recommended use of antimanic drugs was an estimated 3.1 percentage points higher than expected once analyses controlled for baseline trends. The monthly proportion of beneficiaries with seven or more days of antidepressant monotherapy was 2.1 percentage points lower than expected. The number of emergency department visits per month temporarily increased by 19% immediately posttransition. Increased receipt of guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy for bipolar I disorder may reflect relatively less restrictive management of antimanic medications under Part D. The clinical significance of the change is unclear, given the small effect sizes. However, increased emergency department visits merit attention for the Medicaid beneficiaries who continue to transition to Part D. Authors: Burns ME; Busch AB; 1;65(3):323-9. Characteristics of Diabetic Patients associated with Achieving and Maintaining Blood Pressure Targets in the Adherence and Intensification of Medications Program To determine patient characteristics associated with achieving and sustaining blood pressure (BP) targets in the Adherence and Intensification of Medications program, a program led by pharmacists trained in motivational interviewing and authorized to make BP medication changes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with diabetes and persistent hypertension in Kaiser Permanente and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Using two-level logistic regression, baseline survey data from 458 program participants were examined to determine patient characteristics associated with (1) discharge from the program with a target BP (short-term success) and (2) maintenance of the target BP over a nine-month period (long-term success). In multivariable analyses, patients who screened positive for depression or had a higher baseline systolic BP were less likely to achieve short-term success (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) p?0.01; respectively). Patients who reported at baseline one or more barriers to medication adherence were less likely to achieve long-term success (AOR 0.50 [0.26-0.94], p?=?0.03). Although almost 90% of patients achieved short-term success, only 28% achieved long-term success. Baseline barriers to adherence were associated with lack of long-term success and could be the target of maintenance programs for patients who achieve short-term Use of the Refill Function Through an Online Patient Portal is Associated With Improved Adherence to Statins in an Integrated Health System Online patient portals are being widely implemented, but their impact on health behaviors are not well-studied. To determine whether statin adherence improved after initiating use of the portal refill function. Observational cohort study within an integrated health care delivery system. Diabetic patients on statins who had registered for online portal access by 2010. A total of 8705 subjects initiated the online refill function use within the study window, including \"exclusive\" and \"occasional\" users (ie, requesting all vs. some refills online, respectively). Using risk-set sampling, we temporally matched 9055 reference group patients who never used online refills. We calculated statin adherence before and after refill function initiation, assessed as percent time without medications (nonadherence defined as a gap of >20%). Secondary outcome was [low-density lipoprotein nonadherence and dyslipidemia, comparing refill function users to the reference group and adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, medications, frequency of portal use, and outpatient visits. In unadjusted examinations, nonadherence decreased only among patients initiating occasional or exclusive use of the refill function (26%-24% and 22%-15%, respectively). In adjusted models, nonadherence declined by an absolute 6% (95% confidence interval, 4%-7%) among exclusive users, without significant changes among occasional users. Similar LDL decreases were also seen among exclusive users. Compared with portal users who did not refill medications online, adherence to statin medications and LDL levels improved among diabetic patients who initiated and exclusively used the patient portal for refills, suggesting that wider adoption of online refills may improve adherence.

Rates of Complications and Mortality in Older Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: The Diabetes and Aging Study In the coming decades, the population of older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus is expected to grow substantially. Understanding the clinical course of diabetes in this population is critical for establishing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations, identifying research priorities, allocating resources, and setting health care policies. OBJECTIVE To contrast the rates of diabetes complications and mortality across age and diabetes duration categories. This cohort study (2004-2010) included 72,310 older (? 60 years) patients with type 2 diabetes enrolled in a large, integrated health care delivery system. Incidence densities (events per 1000 person-years) were calculated for each age category (60-69, 70-79, and ? 80 years) and duration of diabetes (shorter [0-9 years] vs longer [? 10 years]). Incident acute hyperglycemic events, acute hypoglycemic events (hypoglycemia), microvascular complications (end-stage renal disease, peripheral vascular disease, lower limb amputation, and diabetic eye disease), cardiovascular complications (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and congestive heart failure), and all-cause mortality. Among older adults with diabetes of short duration, cardiovascular complications followed by hypoglycemia were the most common nonfatal complications. For example, among individuals aged 70 to 79 years with a short duration of diabetes, coronary artery disease and hypoglycemia rates were higher (11.47 per 1000 person-years and 5.03 per 1000 person-years, respectively) compared with end-stage renal disease (2.60 per 1000 person-years), lower limb amputation (1.28 per 1000 person-years), and acute hyperglycemic events (0.82 per 1000 person-years). We observed a similar pattern among patients in the same age group with a long duration of diabetes, with some of the highest incidence rates in coronary artery disease and hypoglycemia (18.98 per 1000 person-years and 15.88 per 1000 person-years, respectively) compared with end-stage renal disease (7.64 per 1000 person-years), lower limb amputation (4.26 per 1000 person-years), and acute hyperglycemic events (1.76 per 1000 person-years). For a given age group, the rates of each outcome, particularly hypoglycemia and microvascular complications, increased dramatically with longer duration of the disease. However, for a given duration of diabetes, rates of hypoglycemia, cardiovascular complications, and mortality increased steeply with advancing age, and rates of microvascular complications remained stable or declined. Duration of diabetes and advancing age independently predict diabetes morbidity and mortality rates. As long-term survivorship with diabetes increases and as the population ages, more research and public health efforts to reduce hypoglycemia will be needed to complement ongoing efforts to reduce cardiovascular and microvascular complications. Authors: Med. Pharmacologic Therapies for the Management of Crohn's Disease: Comparative Effectiveness The purpose of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of biologics, immunomodulators, corticosteroids, and aminosalicylates in the treatment of Crohn's disease. We searched MEDLINE(\u00ae) (1966 through June 2011), Embase(\u00ae) (1974 through June 2011), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 2, 2011). Two reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and articles, and included English-language articles that reported on induction or maintenance of remission in placebo-controlled or head-to-head randomized controlled trials. We also included observational studies with a comparison group if they reported on the safety of treatment. Two reviewers extracted study information using standardized forms and independently assessed study quality. Efficacy was measured by induction and maintenance of remission. Remission was defined using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index, mucosal healing, the absence of Crohn's disease hospitalizations or surgeries, reduction of steroids, fistula healing, and patient-reported outcomes. A difference of 10 percentage points in the outcome between treatment groups was considered clinically meaningful. The safety outcomes of interest were mortality, occurrence of lymphomas and other cancers, infections, infusion- and injection-site reactions, and bone fractures for adults and children. Growth was an additional safety concern for children. We included 136 studies involving 148,733 patients. Twenty-three percent of trials directly compared different treatment strategies. The majority of trials excluded patients with mild disease and those with a history of surgical resection. The majority of trials allowed patients to take other Crohn's disease treatments during the trial. For adults, infliximab and 6-methyl-prednisolone were consistently favored over placebo across the induction and maintenance outcomes. Natalizumab and azathioprine were favored over placebo across the maintenance outcomes. Other comparisons either did not have more than one outcome reported or had inconsistent results. The quality of the safety evidence was poor due to poor reporting of the methods in trials and poor confounding control in observational studies, and no strong signals of harm were identified. For children, the strength of evidence was low or insufficient to support the efficacy of any medication to induce or maintain remission. No pediatric study reported on serious adverse events such as mortality, lymphoma, or other cancers. Measuring the efficacy of medications using multiple outcomes, infliximab and 6-methyl-prednisolone induce and maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease. Natalizumab and azathioprine maintain remission. Comparing Crohn's disease medications directly using pragmatic clinical trials will help to understand the effectiveness of medications in clinical practice using outcomes other than the Crohn's Disease Activity Index. for Healthcare Research and Quality (US); 2014. The Association between EHRs and Care Coordination Varies by Team Cohesion To examine whether primary care team cohesion changes the association between using an integrated outpatient-inpatient electronic health record (EHR) and clinician-rated care coordination across delivery sites. Self-administered surveys of primary care clinicians in a large integrated delivery system, collected in 2005 (N=565), 2006 (N=678), and 2008 (N=626) during the staggered implementation of an integrated EHR (2005-2010), including validated questions on team cohesion. Using multivariable regression, we examined the combined effect of EHR use and team cohesion on three dimensions of care coordination across delivery sites: access to timely and complete information, treatment agreement, and responsibility agreement. Among clinicians working in teams with higher cohesion, EHR use was associated with significant improvements in reported access to timely and complete information (53.5 percent with EHR vs. 37.6 percent without integrated-EHR), agreement on treatment goals (64.3 percent vs. 50.6 percent), and agreement on responsibilities (63.9 percent vs. 55.2 percent, all p<.05). We found no statistically significant association between use of the integrated-EHR and reported care coordination in less cohesive teams. The association between EHR use and reported care coordination varied by level of team cohesion. EHRs may not improve care coordination in less cohesive Feb;49(1 Pt 2):438-52. Epub 2013-12-21. Novel Use and Utility of Integrated Electronic Health Records to Assess Rates of Prediabetes Recognition and Treatment: Brief Report From an Integrated Electronic Health Records Pilot Study This study uses novel methods to examine the frequency of diagnosis and treatment of prediabetes in real-world clinical settings using electronic health record (EHR) data. We identified a cohort of 358,120 adults with incident prediabetes (fasting plasma or glycated hemoglobin 5.7-6.4% [39-46 mmol/mol]) between 2006 and 2010 and examined rates of diagnosis and treatment in the 6 months after identification. In the 6 months after identification of prediabetes, 18% of patients had their blood glucose levels retested; 13% received a physician diagnosis of prediabetes/hyperglycemia; 31.0% had prediabetes, diabetes, or lifestyle documented in the clinical notes; and <0.1% initiated metformin. initiation rates of follow-up and treatment for prediabetes are low. EHR data may be a valuable tool to improve identification and treatment of prediabetes in the U.S. Authors: 2014 Feb;37(2):565-8. Epub 2013-11-22. Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health Care Utilization and Outcomes Among Ulcerative Colitis Patients in an Integrated Health-Care Organization Current knowledge of racial disparities in healthcare utilization and disease outcomes for ulcerative colitis (UC) is limited. We sought to investigate these differences among Caucasian, African American, Asian, and Hispanic patients with ulcerative colitis in Kaiser Permanente, a large integrated health-care system in Northern California. This retrospective cohort study used computerized clinical data from 5,196 Caucasians, 387 African-Americans, 550 Asians, and 801 Hispanics with prevalent UC identified between 1996 and 2007. Healthcare utilization and outcomes were compared at one and five-year follow-up by use of multivariate logistic regression analysis. Compared with whites, the male-to-female ratio differed for African-Americans (0.68 vs. 0.91, p < 0.01) and Asians (1.3 vs. 0.91, p < 0.01). Asians had fewer co-morbid conditions (p < 0.01) than whites, whereas more African-Americans had hypertension and asthma (p < 0.01). Use of immunomodulators did not differ significantly among race and/or ethnic groups. Among Asians, 5-ASA use was highest (p < 0.05) and the incidence of surgery was lowest (p < 0.01). Prolonged steroid exposure was more common among Hispanics (p < 0.05 at 1-year) who also had more UC-related surgery (p < 0.01 at 5-year) and hospitalization (<0.05 at 5-year), although these differences were not significant in multivariate analysis. In this population of UC patients with good access to care, overall health-care utilization patterns and clinical outcomes were similar across races and ethnicity. Asians may have milder disease than other races whereas Hispanics had a trend toward more aggressive disease, although the differences we observed were modest. These differences may be related to biological factors or different treatment preferences. Authors: Li D; of Unattempted Central Venous Catheterization in Septic Patients Eligible for Early Goal-directed Therapy Central venous catheterization (CVC) can be an important component of the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. CVC, however, is a time- and resource-intensive procedure associated with serious complications. The effects of the absence of shock or the presence of relative contraindications on undertaking central line placement in septic emergency department (ED) patients eligible for early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) have not been well described. We sought to determine the association of relative normotension (sustained systolic blood pressure >90 mmHg independent of or in response to an initial crystalloid resuscitation of 20 mL/kg), obesity (body mass thrombocytopenia (platelet <50,000 ?2.0) with unattempted CVC in EGDT-eligible patients. This was a retrospective cohort study of 421 adults who met EGDT criteria in 5 community EDs over a period of 13 months. We compared patients with attempted thoracic (internal jugular or subclavian) CVC with those who did not undergo an attempted thoracic line. We also compared patients with any attempted CVC (either thoracic or femoral) with those who did not undergo any attempted central line. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to calculate adjusted odd ratios (AORs). In our study, 364 (86.5%) patients underwent attempted thoracic CVC and 57 (13.5%) did not. Relative normotension associated with CVC (AOR When assessing for attempted catheterization of any central venous site (thoracic or femoral), 382 (90.7%) patients underwent attempted catheterization and 39 (9.3%) patients did not. Relative normotension was not (AOR 0.6; 95% was not significantly associated with unattempted CVC, either thoracic in location or at any site. Septic patients eligible for EGDT with relative normotension and those with moderate thrombocytopenia were less likely to undergo attempted CVC at any site. Those with coagulopathy were also less likely to undergo attempted thoracic central line placement. Knowledge of the decision-making calculus at play for physicians considering central venous catheterization in this population can help inform physician education and performance improvement programs.

Exercise as a Vital Sign: A Quasi-Experimental Analysis of a Health System Intervention to Collect Patient-Reported Exercise Levels Lack of regular physical activity is highly prevalent in U.S. adults and significantly increases mortality risk. To examine the clinical impact of a newly implemented program (\"Exercise as a Vital Sign\" [EVS]) designed to systematically ascertain patient-reported exercise levels at the beginning of each outpatient visit. The EVS program was implemented in four of 11 medical centers between April 2010 and October 2011 within a single health delivery system (Kaiser Permanente Northern California). We used a quasi-experimental analysis approach to compare visit-level and patient-level outcomes among practices with and without the EVS program. Our longitudinal observational cohort included over 1.5 million visits by 696,267 adults to 1,196 primary care providers. Exercise documentation in physician progress notes; lifestyle-related referrals (e.g. exercise programs, nutrition and weight loss consultation); patient report of physician exercise counseling; weight change among overweight/obese patients; and HbA1c changes among patients with diabetes. EVS implementation was associated with greater exercise-related progress note documentation (26.2 % vs 23.7 % of visits, aOR 1.12 [95 % CI: 1.11-1.13], p?0.001) and vs 1.7 %; aOR 1.14 [1.11-1.18], p?0.001) compared to visits without EVS. Surveyed patients (n?=?6,880) were more likely to report physician exercise counseling (88 % vs. 76 %, p?0.001). Overweight patients (BMI 25-29 kg/m(2), n?=?230,326) had greater relative weight loss (0.20 [0.12 - 0.28] lbs, p?0.001) and patients with diabetes and baseline HbA1c?>?7.0 % (n?=?30,487) had greater relative HbA1c decline (0.1 % %-0.13 %], p?0.001) in EVS practices compared to non-EVS practices. Systematically collecting exercise information during outpatient visits is associated with small but significant changes in exercise-related clinical processes and outcomes, and represents a valuable first step towards addressing the problem of inadequate physical activity.

A pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial of diabetes prevention strategies for women with gestational diabetes: design and rationale of the Gestational Diabetes' Effects on Moms (GEM) study Women with gestational diabetes (GDM) are at high risk of developing diabetes later in life. After a GDM diagnosis, women receive prenatal care to control their blood glucose levels via diet, physical activity and medications. Continuing such lifestyle skills into early motherhood may reduce the risk of diabetes in this high risk population. In the Gestational Diabetes' Effects on Moms (GEM) study, we are evaluating the comparative effectiveness of diabetes prevention strategies for weight management designed for pregnant/postpartum women with GDM and delivered at the health system level. The GEM study is a pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial of 44 medical facilities at Kaiser Permanente Northern California randomly assigned to either the intervention or usual care conditions, that includes 2,320 women with a GDM diagnosis between March 27, 2011 and March 30, 2012. A Diabetes Prevention Program-derived print/telephone lifestyle intervention of 13 telephonic sessions tailored to pregnant/postpartum women was developed. The effectiveness of this intervention added to usual care is to be compared to usual care practices alone, which includes two pages of printed lifestyle recommendations sent to postpartum women via mail. Primary outcomes include the proportion of women who reach a postpartum weight goal and total weight change. Secondary outcomes include postpartum glycemia, blood pressure, depression, percent of calories from fat, total caloric intake and physical activity levels. Data were collected through electronic medical records and surveys at baseline (soon after GDM diagnosis), 6 weeks (range 2 to 11 weeks), 6 months (range 12 to 34 weeks) and 12 months postpartum (range 35 to 64 weeks). There is a need for evidence regarding the effectiveness of lifestyle modification for the prevention of diabetes in women with GDM, as well as confirmation that a diabetes prevention program delivered at the health system level is able to successfully reach this population. Given the use of a telephonic case management model, our Diabetes Prevention Program-derived print/telephone intervention has the potential to be adopted in other settings and to inform policies to promote the prevention of diabetes among women with GDM. Medicare star excludes diabetes patients with poor CVD risk factor control CMS recently added medication adherence to antihypertensives, antihyperlipidemics, and oral antihyperglycemics to its Medicare Star quality measures. These CMS metrics exclude patients with <2 medication fills (ie, \"early nonadherence\") and patients concurrently taking insulin. This study examined the proportion of patients with diabetes prescribed cardiovascular disease (CVD) medications excluded from Star adherence metrics and assessed the relationship of both Star-defined adherence and exclusion from Star metrics with CVD risk factor control. Cross-sectional, population-based analysis of 129,040 patients with diabetes aged ?65 years in 2010 from 3 Kaiser Permanente regions. We estimated adjusted risk ratios to assess the relationship between achieving Star adherence and being excluded from Star adherence metrics, with CVD risk factor control (glycated hemoglobin [A1C]<8.0%, mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure [SBP]<130 mm Hg) in patients with diabetes. Star metrics excluded 27% of patients with diabetes prescribed oral medications. Star-defined nonadherence was negatively associated with CVD risk factor [RR], Exclusion from Star metrics due to early nonadherence was also strongly associated with poor control (RR, 0.83, 0.56, 0.87 for A1C, LDL-C, and SBP control, respectively; P<.001). Exclusion for insulin use was negatively associated with A1C control (RR, 0.78; P<.0001). Medicare Star adherence measures underestimate the prevalence of medication nonadherence in diabetes and exclude patients at high risk for poor CVD outcomes. Up to 3 million elderly patients with diabetes may be excluded from these measures nationally. Quality measures designed to encourage effective medication use should focus on all patients treated for CVD Care. 2014;20(12):e573-81. Epub 2014-12-01. Predicting red blood cell transfusion in hospitalized patients: role of hemoglobin level, comorbidities, and illness severity Randomized controlled trial evidence supports a restrictive strategy of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, but significant variation in clinical transfusion practice persists. Patient characteristics other than hemoglobin levels may influence the decision to transfuse RBCs and explain some of this variation. Our objective was to evaluate the role of patient comorbidities and severity of illness in predicting inpatient red blood cell transfusion events. We developed a predictive model of inpatient RBC transfusion using comprehensive electronic medical record (EMR) data from 21 hospitals over a four year period (2008-2011). Using a retrospective cohort study design, we modeled predictors of transfusion events within 24 hours of hospital admission and throughout the entire hospitalization. Model predictors included administrative data (age, sex, comorbid conditions, admission type, and admission diagnosis), admission hemoglobin, severity of illness, prior inpatient RBC transfusion, admission ward, and hospital. The study cohort included 275,874 patients who experienced 444,969 hospitalizations. The 24 hour and overall inpatient RBC transfusion rates were 7.2% and 13.9%, respectively. A predictive model for transfusion within 24 hours of hospital admission had a C-statistic of 0.928 and pseudo-R2 of 0.542; corresponding values for the model examining transfusion through the entire hospitalization were 0.872 and 0.437. Inclusion of the admission hemoglobin resulted in the greatest improvement in model performance relative to patient comorbidities and severity of illness. Data from electronic medical records at the time of admission predicts with very high likelihood the incidence of red blood transfusion events in the first 24 hours and throughout hospitalization. Patient comorbidities and severity of illness on admission play a small role in predicting the likelihood of RBC transfusion relative to the admission hemoglobin.

Spatial pattern of body mass index among adults in the diabetes study of Northern California (DISTANCE) The role that environmental factors, such as neighborhood socioeconomics, food, and physical environment, play in the risk of obesity and chronic diseases is not well quantified. Understanding how spatial distribution of disease risk factors overlap with that of environmental (contextual) characteristics may inform health interventions and policies aimed at reducing the environment risk factors. We evaluated the extent to which spatial clustering of extreme body mass index (BMI) values among a large sample of adults with diabetes was explained by individual characteristics and contextual factors. We quantified spatial clustering of BMI among 15,854 adults with diabetes from the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) cohort using the Global and Local Moran's I spatial statistic. As a null model, we assessed the amount of clustering when BMI values were randomly assigned. To evaluate predictors of spatial clustering, we estimated two linear models to estimate BMI residuals. First we included individual factors (demographic and socioeconomic characteristics). Then we added contextual factors (neighborhood deprivation, food environment) that may be associated with BMI. We assessed the amount of clustering that remained using BMI residuals. Global Moran's I indicated significant clustering of extreme BMI values; however, after accounting for individual socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, there was no longer significant clustering. Twelve percent of the sample clustered in extreme high or low BMI clusters, whereas, only 2.67% of the sample was clustered when BMI values were randomly assigned. After accounting for individual characteristics, we found clustering of 3.8% while accounting for neighborhood characteristics resulted in 6.0% clustering of BMI. After additional adjustment of neighborhood characteristics, clustering was reduced to 3.4%, effectively accounting for spatial clustering of BMI. We found substantial clustering of extreme high and low BMI values in Northern California among adults with diabetes. Individual characteristics explained somewhat more of clustering of the BMI values than did neighborhood characteristics. These findings, although cross-sectional, may suggest that selection into neighborhoods as the primary explanation of why individuals with extreme BMI values live close to one another. Further studies are needed to assess causes of extreme BMI clustering, and to identify any community level role to influence behavior change. Geogr. 2014;13:48. Epub 2014-12-04. Diabetes care and outcomes for American Indians and Alaska natives in commercial integrated delivery systems: a SUrveillance, PREvention, and ManagEment of Diabetes Mellitus (SUPREME-DM) Study To compare cardiovascular disease risk factor testing rates and intermediate outcomes of care between American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) patients with diabetes and non-Hispanic Caucasians enrolled in nine commercial integrated delivery systems in the USA. We used modified Poisson regression models to compare the annual testing rates and risk factor control levels for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and of unique diabetes drug classes; insulin use; and oral diabetes drug medication adherence between insured AI/AN and non-Hispanic white adults with diabetes aged ?18 in 2011. 5831 AI/AN patients (1.8% of the cohort) met inclusion criteria. After adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, insulin use, and geocoded socioeconomic status, AI/AN patients had similar rates of annual HbA1c, LDL-C, and SBP testing, and LDL-C and SBP control, compared with non-Hispanic Caucasians. However, AI/AN patients were significantly more likely to have HbA1c >9% (>74.9?mmol/mol; RR=1.47, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.58), and significantly less likely to adhere to their oral diabetes medications (RR=0.90, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.93) compared with non-Hispanic Caucasians. AI/AN patients in commercial integrated delivery systems have similar blood pressure and cholesterol testing and control, but significantly lower rates of HbA1c control and diabetes medication adherence, compared with non-Hispanic Caucasians. As more AI/ANs move to urban and suburban settings, clinicians and health plans should focus on addressing disparities in diabetes care and outcomes in this population.

Stratification of Risk of Early-Onset Sepsis in >=34 Weeks' Gestation To define a quantitative stratification algorithm for the risk of early-onset sepsis (EOS) in newborns ? 34 weeks' gestation. We conducted a retrospective nested case-control study that used split validation. Data collected on each infant included sepsis risk at birth based on objective maternal factors, demographics, specific clinical milestones, and vital signs during the first 24 hours after birth. Using a combination of recursive partitioning and logistic regression, we developed a risk classification scheme for EOS on the derivation dataset. This scheme was then applied to the validation dataset. Using a base population of 608,014 live births ? 34 weeks' gestation at 14 hospitals between 1993 and 2007, we identified all 350 EOS cases <72 hours of age and frequency matched them by hospital and year of birth to 1063 controls. Using maternal and neonatal data, we defined a risk stratification scheme that divided the neonatal population into 3 groups: treat empirically (4.1% of all live births, 60.8% of all EOS cases, sepsis incidence of 8.4/1000 live births), observe and evaluate (11.1% of births, 23.4% of cases, 1.2/1000), and continued observation (84.8% of births, 15.7% of cases, incidence 0.11/1000). It is possible to combine objective maternal data with evolving objective neonatal clinical findings to define more efficient strategies for the evaluation and treatment of EOS in term and late preterm infants. Judicious application of our scheme could result in decreased antibiotic treatment in 80,000 to 240,000 US newborns each year. Authors: 2013-12-23. The DISTANCE model for collaborative research: distributing analytic effort using scrambled data sets Data-sharing is encouraged to fulfill the ethical responsibility to transform research data into public health knowledge, but data sharing carries risks of improper disclosure and potential harm from release of individually identifiable data. The study objective was to develop and implement a novel method for scientific collaboration and data sharing which distributes the analytic burden while protecting patient privacy. A procedure was developed where in an investigator who is external to an analytic coordinating center (ACC) can conduct original research following a protocol governed by a Publications and Presentations (P&P) Committee. The collaborating investigator submits a study proposal and, if approved, develops the analytic specifications using existing data dictionaries and templates. An original data set is prepared according to the specifications and the external investigator is provided with a complete but de-identified and shuffled data set which retains all key data fields but which obfuscates individually identifiable data and patterns; this\" scrambled data set\" provides a \"sandbox\" for the external investigator to develop and test analytic code for analyses. The analytic code is then run against the original data at the ACC to generate output which is used by the external investigator in preparing a manuscript for journal submission. The method has been successfully used with collaborators to produce many published papers and conference reports. By distributing the analytic burden, this method can facilitate collaboration and expand analytic capacity, resulting in more science for less money. Authors: Leisure-Time Activity Categorical Item (L-Cat): a single categorical item sensitive to physical activity changes in overweight/obese women Physical activity is essential for chronic disease prevention, yet <40% of overweight/obese adults meet the national activity recommendations. For time-efficient counseling, clinicians need a brief, easy-to-use tool that reliably and validly assesses a full range of activity levels, and, most importantly, is sensitive to clinically meaningful changes in activity. The Stanford Leisure-Time Activity Categorical Item (L-Cat) is a single item comprising six descriptive categories ranging from inactive to very active. This novel methodological approach assesses national activity recommendations as well as multiple clinically relevant categories below and above the recommendations, and incorporates critical methodological principles that enhance psychometrics (reliability, validity and sensitivity to change). We evaluated the L-Cat's psychometrics among 267 overweight/obese women who were asked to meet the national activity recommendations in a randomized behavioral weight-loss trial. The L-Cat had excellent test-retest reliability (?=0.64, P<0.001) and adequate concurrent criterion validity; each L-Cat category at 6 months was associated with 1059 more daily pedometer steps (95% CI 712-1407, ?=0.38, P<0.001) and 1.9% greater initial weight months (95% CI -2.4 to -1.3, ?=-0.38, P<0.001). Of interest, L-Cat categories differentiated from each other in a dose-response gradient for steps and weight loss (Ps<0.05) with excellent face validity. The L-Cat was sensitive to change in response to the trial's activity component. Women increased one L-Cat category at 6 months (M=1.0\u00b11.4, P<0.001); 55.8% met the recommendations at 6 months whereas 20.6% did at baseline (P<0.001). Even among women not meeting the recommendations at both baseline and 6 months (n=106), women who moved ?1?L-Cat categories at 6 months lost more weight than those who did not (M=-4.6%, 95% CI -6.7 to -2.5, P<0.001). Given strong psychometrics, the L-Cat has timely potential for clinical use such as tracking activity changes via electronic medical records, especially among overweight/obese populations who are unable or unlikely to reach national recommendations. Authors: Kiernan in Women with Diabetes Mellitus Although many studies have shown that diabetes increases the risk for urinary incontinence, it is unclear whether poor glycemic control in women with diabetes is associated with incontinence. This study aims to determine the relationship between the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level and urinary incontinence in a large, diverse cohort of older women. We examined 6026 older women who responded to a survey (62% response rate) and were enrolled in the Diabetes and Aging Study, an ethnically stratified random sample of patients with diabetes enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Our primary independent variable was the mean of all HbA1c measurements in the year preceding the survey. Outcomes included the presence/absence of incontinence and limitations in daily activities due to incontinence. We used modified Poisson regression and ordinal logistic regression models to account for age, race, body mass index, parity, diabetes treatment, duration of diabetes, and comorbidity. Sixty-five percent of women reported incontinence (mean age 59\u00b110 years). After adjustment, HbA1c levels were not associated with the presence or absence of incontinence. However, among women reporting incontinence, HbA1c ?9% was associated with more limitations due to incontinence than HbA1c <6% (adjusted odds ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-2.57). In this cross-sectional analysis, HbA1c level is not associated with the presence or absence of incontinence. However, for women with incontinence, poor glycemic control (HbA1c ?9%) is associated with more limitations in daily activities due to incontinence. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether improving glycemic control to HbA1c <9% leads to fewer limitations in daily activities due to incontinence.

Hospital readmissions and emergency department visits in moderate preterm, late preterm, and early term infants The increased vulnerability of late preterm infants is no longer a novel concept in neonatology, with many studies documenting excess morbidity and mortality in these infants during the birth hospitalization. Because outcomes related to gestational age constitute a continuum, it is important to analyze data from the gestational age groups that bookend late preterm infants infants-moderate preterm infants (31-32 weeks) and early term infants (37-38 weeks). This article evaluates hospital readmissions and emergency department visits in the first 30 days after discharge from birth hospitalization in a large cohort of infants greater than or equal to 31 weeks' gestation. visit priorities for complex patients: A summary of the literature and conceptual model to guide innovative interventions With the aging of the population and continuing advances in health care, patients seen in the primary care setting are increasingly complex. At the same time, the number of screening and chronic condition management tasks primary care providers are expected to cover during brief primary care office visits has continued to grow. These converging trends mean that there is often not enough time during each visit to address all of the patient's concerns and needs, a significant barrier to effectively providing patient-centered care. For complex patients, prioritization of which issues to address during a given visit must precede discrete decisions about disease-specific treatment preferences and goals. Negotiating this process of setting priorities represents a major challenge for patient-centered primary care, as patient and provider priorities may not always be aligned. In this review, we present a synthesis of recent research on how patients and providers negotiate the visit process and describe a conceptual model to guide innovative approaches to more effective primary care visits for complex patients based on defining visit priorities. The goal of this model is to inform interventions that maximize the value of available time during the primary care encounter by facilitating communication between a prepared patient who has had time before the visit to identify his/her priorities and an informed provider who is aware of the patient's care priorities at the beginning of the visit. We conclude with a discussion of key questions that should guide future research and intervention development in this area. Authors: Grant RW; 2013 Dec;1(3-4):117-122. Branched chain and aromatic amino acids change acutely following two medical therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus Elevated circulating levels of branched chain and aromatic amino acids (BCAA/AAAs) are associated with insulin resistance and incident type 2 diabetes (T2D). BCAA/AAAs decrease acutely during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a diagnostic test for T2D. It is unknown whether changes in BCAA/AAAs also signal an early response to commonly used medical therapies for T2D. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach was used to measure BCAA/AAAs in 30 insulin sensitive (IS) and 30 insulin resistant (IR) subjects before and after: (1) one dose of a sulfonylurea medication, glipizide, 5 mg orally; (2) two days of twice daily metformin 500 mg orally; and (3) a 75-g OGTT. Percent change in BCAA/AAAs was determined after each intervention. Following glipizide, which increased insulin and decreased glucose in both subject groups, BCAA/AAAs decreased in the IS subjects only (all P<0.05). Following metformin, which decreased glucose and insulin in only the IR subjects, 4 BCAA/AAAs increased in the IR subjects at or below P=0.05, and none changed in the IS subjects. Following OGTT, which increased glucose and insulin in all subjects, BCAA/AAAs decreased in all subjects (P<0.05). BCAA/AAAs changed acutely during glipizide and metformin administration, and the magnitude and direction of change differed by the insulin resistance status of the individual and the intervention. These results indicate that BCAA/AAAs may be useful biomarkers for monitoring the early response to therapeutic interventions for T2D. Authors: Self-Reported physical functioning and mortality among individuals with type 2 diabetes: insights from TRIAD To examine the association between physical functioning and mortality in people with type 2 diabetes, and determine if this association differs by race/ethnicity in managed care. We studied 7894 type 2 diabetic patients in Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD), a prospective observational study of diabetes care in managed care. Physical functioning was assessed with the Short Form Health Survey. The National Death Index was searched for deaths over 10years of follow-up (2000-2009). At baseline, mean age was 61.7years, 50% were non-Hispanic White, 22% were Black, and 16% of participants reported good physical functioning. Over 10years, 28% of participants died; 39% due to cardiovascular disease. Relative to those reporting good functioning, those reporting poor physical functioning had a 39% higher all-cause death rate after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, body mass index, smoking, and comorbidities (Hazard Ratio=1.39; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.16, 1.67). Although Blacks were less likely than Whites to report good functioning (p<0.01), the association between functioning and mortality did not differ by race/ethnicity. In this managed care population, self-reported physical functioning was a robust independent predictor of mortality and may be a useful benchmark for tailoring clinical care.

HbA1c and Risk of Severe Hypoglycemia in Type 2 Diabetes: The Diabetes and Aging Study We examined the association between HbA1c level and self-reported severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetic patients in a large, integrated healthcare system, who were 30-77 years of age and treated with glucose-lowering therapy, were asked about severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance in the year prior to the Diabetes Study of Northern California survey conducted in 2005-2006 (62% response rate). The main exposure of interest was the last HbA1c level collected in the year preceding the observation period. Poisson regression models adjusted for selected demographic and clinical variables were specified to evaluate the relative risk (RR) of severe hypoglycemia across HbA1c levels. We also tested whether the HbA1c-hypoglycemia association differed across potential effect modifiers (age, diabetes duration, and category of diabetes medication). Among 9,094 eligible survey respondents (mean age 59.5 \u00b1 9.8 years, mean HbA1c 7.5 \u00b1 1.5%), 985 (10.8%) reported experiencing severe hypoglycemia. Across HbA1c levels, rates of hypoglycemia were 9.3-13.8%. Compared with those with HbA1c of 7-7.9%, the RR of hypoglycemia was 1.25 (95% CI 0.99-1.57), 1.01 (0.87-1.18), 0.99 (0.82-1.20), HbA1c <6, 6-6.9, 8-8.9, and ?9%, respectively, in a fully adjusted model. Age, diabetes duration, and category of diabetes medication did not significantly modify the HbA1c-hypoglycemia relationship. Severe hypoglycemia was common among patients with type 2 diabetes across all levels of glycemic control. Risk tended to be higher in patients with either near-normal glycemia or very Epub 2013-07-30. Safety and effectiveness of mail order pharmacy use in diabetes Although research suggests that mail order pharmacy use is associated with greater medication adherence and cardiovascular disease risk factor control, no research has examined the potential impact of mail order pharmacy use on patient safety and utilization. To compare safety and utilization outcomes in patients using mail order versus local pharmacies. Cross-sectional, observational study of 17,217 Kaiser Permanente Northern California adult diabetes patients prescribed new cardiometabolic medications in 2006. Multivariate logistic regressions assessed the association between mail order pharmacy use and all-cause and preventable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits; laboratory tests for monitoring persistent medications; and overlapping days of supply of contraindicated medications. Results were stratified by patient age and converted to adjusted predicted percentages. Patients aged less than 65 years using mail order had fewer ED visits (33.8% vs 40.2%; P <.001); preventable laboratory or diuretic initiation (41.2% vs 47.2%; P <.01). Among patients aged 65 or more years, mail order users had fewer preventable ED visits (13.4% vs 16.3%; P <.01); but slightly more occurrences of overlapping days of supply of contraindicated medications (1.1% vs 0.7%; P <.01). Mail order pharmacy use is not associated with adverse outcomes in most diabetes patients, and is associated with lower ED use. Interventions to increase mail order pharmacy use should use a patient-centered approach that is sensitive to primary and preventive care access.

Patient-provider communication and trust in relation to use of an online patient portal among diabetes patients: The Diabetes and Aging Study Patient-provider relationships influence diabetes care; less is known about their impact on online patient portal use. Diabetes patients rated provider communication and trust. In this study, we linked responses to electronic medical record data on being a registered portal user and using secure messaging (SM). We specified regression models to evaluate main effects on portal use, and subgroup analyses by race/ethnicity and age. 52% of subjects were registered users; among those, 36% used SM. Those reporting greater trust were more likely to be registered users (relative risk (RR)=1.14) or SM users (RR=1.29). In subgroup analyses, increased trust was associated with being a registered user among white, Latino, and older patients, as well as SM use among white patients. Better communication ratings were also related to being a registered user among older patients. Since increased trust and communication were associated with portal use within subgroups, this suggests that patient-provider relationships encourage portal engagement.

Screening for impaired fasting glucose and diabetes using available health plan data To develop and validate prediction equations to identify individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes using existing health plan data. Health plan data from 2005 to 2009 from 18,527 members of a Midwestern HMO without diabetes, 6% of whom had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ?110mg/dL, and health plan data from 2005 to 2006 from 368,025 members of a West Coast-integrated delivery system without diabetes, 13% of whom had FPG ?110mg/dL were analyzed. Within each health plan, we used multiple logistic regression to develop equations to predict FPG ?110mg/dL for half of the population and validated the equations using the other half. We then externally validated the equations in the other health plan. Areas under the curve for the most parsimonious equations were 0.665 to 0.729 when validated internally. Positive predictive values were 14% to 32% when validated internally and 14% to 29% when validated externally. Multivariate logistic regression equations can be applied to existing health plan data to efficiently identify persons at higher risk for dysglycemia who might benefit from definitive diagnostic testing and interventions to prevent or treat diabetes. 2013-04-12. Responses to Medicare Drug Costs among Near-Poor versus Subsidized Beneficiaries There is limited information on the protective value of Medicare Part D low-income subsidies (LIS). We compared responses to drug costs for LIS recipients with near-poor (?200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level) and higher income beneficiaries without the LIS. Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in 2008. We examined three drug cost responses using multivariate logistic regression: cost-reducing behaviors (e.g., switching to generics), nonadherence (e.g., not refilling prescriptions), and financial stress (e.g., going without necessities). Telephone interviews in a stratified random sample (N = 1,201, 70 percent response rate). After adjustment, a comparable percentage of unsubsidized near-poor (26 percent) and higher income beneficiaries reported cost-reducing behaviors (23 percent, p = .63); fewer LIS beneficiaries reported cost-reducing behaviors (15 percent, p = .019 vs near-poor). Unsubsidized near-poor beneficiaries were more likely to reduce adherence (8.2 percent) than higher income (3.5 percent, p = .049) and LIS beneficiaries (3.1 percent, p = .027). Near-poor beneficiaries also more frequently experienced financial stress due to drug costs (20 percent) than higher income beneficiaries (11 percent, p = .050) and LIS beneficiaries (11 percent, p = .015). Low-income subsidies provide protection from drug cost-related nonadherence and financial stress. Beneficiaries just above the LIS income threshold are most at risk for these potentially adverse behaviors.

Fluid Volume, Lactate Values, and Mortality in Sepsis Patients with Intermediate Lactate Values Patients with severe sepsis without shock or tissue hypoperfusion face substantial mortality; however, treatment guidelines are lacking. To evaluate the association between intravenous fluid resuscitation, lactate clearance, and mortality in patients with \"intermediate\" lactate values of 2 mmol/L or greater and less than 4 mmol/L. This was a retrospective study of 9,190 patients with sepsis with intermediate lactate values. Interval changes between index lactate values and those at 4, 8, and 12 hours were calculated with corresponding weight-based fluid volumes. Outcomes included lactate change and mortality. Repeat lactate tests were completed in 94.7% of patients within 12 hours. Hospital and 30-day mortality were 8.2 and 13.3%, respectively, for patients with lactate clearance; they were 18.7 and 24.7%, respectively, for those without lactate clearance. Each 10% increase in repeat lactate values was associated with a 9.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.8-11.1%) increase in the odds of hospital death. Within 4 hours, patients received 32 (\u00b1 18) ml/kg of fluid. Each 7.5 ml/kg increase was associated with a 1.3% (95% CI = 0.6-2.1%) decrease in repeat lactate. Across an unrestricted range, increased fluid was not associated with improved mortality. However, when limited to less than 45 ml/kg, additional fluid was associated with a trend toward improved survival (odds ratio = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.82-1.03) that was statistically significant among patients with highly concordant fluid records. Early fluid administration, below 45 ml/kg, was associated with modest improvements in lactate clearance and potential improvements in mortality. Further study is needed to define treatment strategies in this prevalent and morbid group of patients with sepsis. Authors: Soc. 2013 Oct;10(5):466-73. Initial Antihyperglycemic Drug Therapy Among 241 327 Adults With Newly Identified Diabetes From 2005 Through 2010: A Surveillance, Prevention, and Management of Diabetes Mellitus (SUPREME-DM) Study Among adults with incident diabetes, data are lacking about first antihyperglycemic initiation and whether medication choice aligns with recommendations. To identify predictors of initiating any antihyperglycemic, and specifically sulfonylurea versus metformin. This retrospective cohort study included 241 327 patients from 11 US health systems, 2005 through 2010. Assessments included antihyperglycemic initiation within 6 months of diabetes identification, first medication initiated, and initiation predictors. Only 40.3% (n = 97 350) started any antihyperglycemic; 75.2% (n = 73 221) started metformin. Glycosylated hemoglobin predicted initiating risk [RR] 3.94, 95% CI 4.07, vs HbA1c >6.5%-7%). Age modified the HbA1c effect: at higher HbA1c, likelihood of starting antihyperglycemics differed little across ages; at lower HbA1c, older patients were less likely to start antihyperglycemics (P < .001). Individuals with elevated serum creatinine (SCr) were more likely to started RR >2 times (2.94, 10.65) likely to start sulfonylurea versus those with HbA1c >6.5%-7% and normal SCr. Age sulfonylurea initiation (20-39 years, RR = 0.87 [0.79, 0.95]; ? 80 years, RR = 2.41 [2.20, 2.65] vs 50-59 years). Among adults with incident diabetes, metformin was generally the first antihyperglycemic initiated. However, 59.7% did not start any antihyperglycemic at diabetes identification.

Implementation of an outpatient electronic health record and emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and office visits among patients with diabetes IMPORTANCE: The US federal government is spending billions of dollars in physician incentives to encourage the meaningful use of electronic health records (EHRs). Although the use of EHRs has potential to improve patient health outcomes, the existing evidence has been limited and inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between implementing a commercially available outpatient EHR and emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and office visits for patients with diabetes mellitus. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Staggered EHR implementation across outpatient clinics in an integrated delivery system (Kaiser Permanente Northern California) between 2005 and 2008 created an opportunity for studying changes associated with EHR use. Among a population-based sample of 169,711 patients with diabetes between 2004 and 2009, we analyzed 4,997,585 person-months before EHR implementation and 4,648,572 person-months after an EHR was being used by patients' physicians. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We examined the association between EHR use and unfavorable clinical events (ED visits and hospitalizations) and office visit use among patients with diabetes, using multivariable regression with patient-level fixed-effect analyses and adjustment for trends over time. RESULTS: In multivariable analyses, use of the EHR was associated with a statistically significantly decreased number of ED visits, 28.80 fewer visits per 1000 patients annually (95% CI, 20.28 to 37.32), from a mean of 519.12 visits per 1000 patients annually without using the EHR to 490.32 per 1000 patients when using the EHR. The EHR was also associated with 13.10 fewer hospitalizations per 1000 patients annually (95% CI, 7.37 to 18.82), from a mean of 251.60 hospitalizations per 1000 patients annually with no EHR to 238.50 per 1000 patients annually when using the EHR. There were similar statistically significant reductions in nonelective hospitalizations (10.92 fewer per 1000 patients annually) and hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (7.08 fewer per 1000 patients annually). There was no statistically significant association between EHR use and office visit rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with diabetes, use of an outpatient EHR in an integrated delivery system was associated with modest reductions in ED visits and hospitalizations but not office visit rates. Further studies are needed to quantify the association of EHR use with changes in costs. Authors: Reed M; Sep 11;310(10):1060-5. Adherence to Immunoprophylaxis Regimens for Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Insured and Medicaid Populations Immunoprophylaxis is the only pharmaceutical intervention for mitigating respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Patient level data on adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) immunoprophylaxis recommendations are limited. This study characterizes adherence to AAP guidelines in privately insured and Medicaid populations. We performed a retrospective birth cohort study of 211 174 privately insured children in Northern California; and 458 837 publicly insured children in Tennessee born between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2008. Adherence to the AAP guideline was defined for eligible infants as the number of doses of RSV immunoprophylaxis administered over the number recommended for 4 mutually exclusive eligibility groups: chronic lung disease, prematurity <29 weeks, prematurity <32 weeks, and other eligibility. We identified 3456 California (Kaiser Permanente Northern California [KPNC]) and 12 251 Tennessee (Tennessee Medicaid [TennCare]) infants meeting AAP eligibility criteria. Immunoprophylaxis administration increased over the study period, from 15% for all eligible groups in 1998 to 54% in 2007. Adherence was highest among babies with chronic lung disease (KPNC 67% and TennCare 55%). Nonadherence (0% adherence) was greatest among infants of African American mothers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .98-1.78); those with mothers with less than a high school education (AOR = 1.58; CI = 1.09-2.30) in KPNC; and in infants of Hispanic mothers in TennCare (AOR = 1.65; CI = 1.24-2.20). In KPNC, 0.11% of ineligible term infants and 5% of ineligible premature infants received immunoprophylaxis; the corresponding proportions in TennCare were 1% and 11%. Overall adherence with AAP guidelines has increased over time. Considerable overuse and underuse of immunoprophylaxis are evident with identifiable risk groups to target for improvement.

Obesity and the Food Environment: Income and Ethnicity Differences Among People With Diabetes: The Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) It is unknown whether any association between neighborhood food environment and obesity varies according to individual income and/or race/ethnicity. The objectives of this study were to test whether there was an association between food environments and obesity among adults with diabetes and whether this relationship differed according to individual income or race/ethnicity. Subjects (n = 16,057) were participants in the Diabetes Study of Northern California survey. Kernel density estimation was used to create a food environment score for each individual's residence address that reflected the mix of healthful and unhealthful food vendors nearby. Logistic regression models estimated the association between the modeled food environment and obesity, controlling for confounders, and testing for interactions between food environment and race/ethnicity and income. The authors found that more healthful food environments were associated with lower obesity in the highest income groups (incomes 301-600% and >600% of U.S. poverty line) among whites, Latinos, and Asians. The association was negative, but smaller and not statistically significant, among high-income blacks. On the contrary, a more healthful food environment was associated with higher obesity among participants in the lowest-income group (<100% poverty threshold), which was statistically significant for black participants in this income category. These findings suggest that the availability of healthful food environments may have different health implications when financial resources are severely constrained. Association Between Estimated GFR, Health-Related Quality of Life, and Depression Among Older Adults With Diabetes: The Diabetes and Aging Study BACKGROUND: Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a highly prevalent condition among older adults with diabetes, the associations between health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and severity of CKD in this population are not well understood. The objective of this study was to assess HRQoL and depressive symptoms across estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) stages. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 5,805 members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, 60 years or older with diabetes, from the 2005-2006 Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) survey. PREDICTOR: eGFR categories were defined using the modified Short Form-8 Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-8. RESULTS: In unadjusted linear regression analyses, physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) HRQoL scores were significantly lower with worsening eGFR level. However, after adjustment for sociodemographics, diabetes duration, obesity, and cardiovascular comorbid conditions and taking into account interactions with proteinuria, none of the eGFR categories was significantly or substantively associated with PCS or MCS score. In both unadjusted and adjusted analyses, higher risk of depressive symptoms was observed in respondents with eGFR =29 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (relative risk, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.10-3.71; P < 0.05) compared with the referent group. However, this eGFR-depression relationship was no longer significant after adjusting for hemoglobin level. LIMITATIONS: Participants are part of a single health care delivery system. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the need for greater attention to and potential interventions for depression in patients with reduced eGFR.

Abnormal vaginal bleeding after epidural steroid injection: a paired observation cohort study OBJECTIVE: The use of epidural steroid injections has increased dramatically, but knowledge of potential adverse effects is lacking. An association between steroid injection and subsequent abnormal vaginal bleeding has been suspected clinically, but evidence has been limited to anecdotal reports. STUDY DESIGN: Paired observational retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records from a large integrated health care system. Participants were all nonhysterectomized women who underwent epidural steroid injections in 2011. For each steroid injection, encounters for abnormal vaginal bleeding during the 60 days preceding and 60 days after the injection were compared as paired observations. For women found to have bleeding, medical records review was performed to examine menopausal status and bleeding evaluation outcomes. RESULTS: Among 8166 epidural steroid injection procedures performed on 6926 nonhysterectomized women, 201 (2.5%) procedures were followed by at least 1 outpatient visit for abnormal vaginal bleeding. Women were 2.8 times more likely to present with abnormal vaginal bleeding during the postinjection period compared with the preinjection period (P < .0001). Of the 197 women with postinjection bleeding, 137 (70%) were premenopausal and 60 (30%) were Postinjection bleeding prompted endometrial biopsy evaluation in 103 (52%) cases, with benign findings for 100% of premenopausal and 95% of postmenopausal women (42/44). CONCLUSION: Epidural steroid injections are associated with subsequent abnormal vaginal bleeding for both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Women undergoing epidural steroid injection should be advised of abnormal bleeding as a potential adverse effect and providers should be aware of this association when evaluating abnormal bleeding.

Automated identification of pneumonia in chest radiograph reports in critically ill patients Prior studies demonstrate the suitability of natural language processing (NLP) for identifying pneumonia in chest radiograph (CXR) reports, however, few evaluate this approach in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. From a total of 194,615 ICU reports, we empirically developed a lexicon to categorize pneumonia-relevant terms and uncertainty profiles. We encoded lexicon items into unique queries within an NLP software application and designed an algorithm to assign automated interpretations ('positive', 'possible', or 'negative') based on each report's query profile. We evaluated algorithm performance in a sample of 2,466 CXR reports interpreted by physician consensus and in two ICU patient subgroups including those admitted for pneumonia and for rheumatologic/endocrine diagnoses. Most reports were deemed 'negative' (51.8%) by physician consensus. Many were 'possible' (41.7%); only 6.5% were 'positive' for pneumonia. The lexicon included 105 terms and uncertainty profiles that were encoded into 31 NLP queries. Queries identified 534,322 'hits' in the full sample, with 2.7 \u00b1 2.6 'hits' per report. An algorithm, comprised of twenty rules and probability steps, assigned interpretations to reports based on query profiles. In the validation set, the algorithm had 92.7% sensitivity, 91.1% specificity, 93.3% positive predictive value, and 90.3% negative predictive value for differentiating 'negative' from 'positive'/'possible' reports. In the ICU subgroups, the algorithm also demonstrated good performance, misclassifying few reports (5.8%). Many CXR reports in ICU patients demonstrate frank uncertainty regarding a pneumonia diagnosis. This electronic tool demonstrates promise for assigning automated interpretations to CXR reports by leveraging both terms and uncertainty profiles. Authors: V; Mak. 2013;13:90. Epub 2013-08-15.

Standardizing terminology and definitions of medication adherence and persistence in research employing electronic databases OBJECTIVE: To propose a unifying set of definitions for prescription adherence research utilizing electronic health record prescribing databases, prescription dispensing databases, and pharmacy claims databases and to provide a conceptual framework to operationalize these definitions consistently across studies. METHODS: We reviewed recent literature to identify definitions in electronic database studies of prescription-filling patterns for chronic oral medications. We then develop a conceptual model and propose standardized terminology and definitions to describe prescription-filling behavior from electronic databases. RESULTS: The conceptual model we propose defines 2 separate constructs: medication adherence and persistence. We define primary and secondary adherence as distinct subtypes of adherence. Metrics for estimating secondary adherence are discussed and critiqued, including a newer metric (New Prescription Medication Gap measure) that enables estimation of both primary and secondary adherence. DISCUSSION: Terminology currently used in prescription adherence research employing electronic databases lacks consistency. We propose a clear, consistent, broadly applicable conceptual model and terminology for such studies. The model and definitions facilitate research utilizing electronic medication prescribing, dispensing, and/or claims databases and encompasses the entire continuum of prescription-filling behavior. CONCLUSION: Employing conceptually clear and consistent terminology to define medication adherence and persistence will facilitate future comparative effectiveness research and meta-analytic studies that utilize electronic prescription and of diagnostic codes and prevalence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in a managed care population, 1996-2009 Few population-based studies have reported the prevalence of psoriatic disease. We validated computerized diagnoses to estimate the prevalence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We identified adults with ?1 ICD-9 diagnosis codes of 696.0 (psoriatic arthritis) or 696.1 (psoriasis) in clinical encounter data during 1996-2009 and used chart review to confirm the diagnoses in random samples of patients. We then used the best performing case-finding algorithms to estimate the point prevalence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The number of persons with a diagnosis for psoriasis (ICD-9 code 696.1) was 87?827. Chart review of a random sample of 101 cases with at least one dermatologist-rendered psoriasis code revealed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 90% (95% CI, 83-95) with Psoriatic arthritis (code 696.0) was recorded for 5187 patients, with the best performing algorithm requiring ?2 diagnoses recorded by a rheumatologist or ?1 diagnosis recorded by a rheumatologist together with ?1 psoriasis diagnoses recorded by a dermatologist; (95% 63-82). Among KPNC adults, the point prevalence of psoriasis, with or without psoriatic arthritis, was 939 (95% CI, 765-1142) per 100?000, and the overall prevalence of psoriatic arthritis, with or without psoriasis, was 68 (95% CI, 54-84) per 100?000. Within an integrated health care delivery system, the use of computerized diagnoses rendered by relevant disease specialists is a valid method for identifying individuals with psoriatic disease.

Persistent recurring wheezing in the fifth year of life after laboratory-confirmed, medically attended respiratory syncytial virus infection in infancy Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infancy is associated with subsequent recurrent wheezing. A retrospective cohort study examined children born at ?32 weeks gestation between 1996-2004. All children were enrolled in an integrated health care delivery system in Northern California and were followed through the fifth year of life. The primary endpoint was recurrent wheezing in the fifth year of life and its association with laboratory-confirmed, medically-attended RSV infection during the first year, prematurity, and supplemental oxygen during birth hospitalization. Other outcomes measured were recurrent wheezing quantified through outpatient visits, inpatient hospital stays, and asthma prescriptions. The study sample included 72,602 children. The rate of recurrent wheezing in the second year was 5.6% and fell to 4.7% by the fifth year. Recurrent wheezing rates varied by risk status: the rate was 12.5% among infants with RSV hospitalization, 8% among infants 32-33 weeks gestation, and 18% in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In multivariate analyses, increasing severity of respiratory syncytial virus infection was significantly associated with recurrent wheezing in year 5; compared with children without RSV infection in infancy, children who only had an outpatient RSV encounter had an adjusted odds ratio of 1.38 (95% CI,1.03-1.85), while children with a prolonged RSV hospitalization had an adjusted odds ratio of 2.59 (95% CI, 1.49-4.50). Laboratory-confirmed, medically attended RSV infection, prematurity, and neonatal exposure to supplemental oxygen have independent associations with development of recurrent wheezing in the fifth year of life. Authors: Escobar GJ; the use of placebo treatments: telephone survey OBJECTIVE: To examine the attitudes of US patients about the use of placebo treatments in medical care. DESIGN: One time telephone surveys. SETTING: Northern California. PARTICIPANTS: 853 members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, aged 18-75, who had been seen by a primary care provider for a chronic health problem at least once in the prior six months. RESULTS: The response rate was 53.4% (853/1598) of all members who were eligible to participate, and 73.2% (853/1165) of all who could be reached by telephone. Most respondents (50-84%) judged it acceptable for doctors to recommend placebo treatments under conditions that varied according to doctors' level of certainty about the benefits and safety of the treatment, the purpose of the treatment, and the transparency with which the treatment was described to patients. Only 21.9% of respondents judged that it was never acceptable for doctors to recommend placebo treatments. Respondents valued honesty by physicians regarding the use of placebos and believed that non-transparent use could undermine the relationship between patients and physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients in this survey seemed favorable to the idea of placebo treatments and valued honesty and transparency in this context, suggesting that physicians should consider engaging with patients to discuss their values and attitudes about the appropriateness of using treatments aimed at promoting placebo responses in the context of clinical decision making. Authors: Tomography Results: External Validation of a Clinical and Imaging Prediction Rule STUDY OBJECTIVE: Clinical variables can reliably exclude a diagnosis of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with negative cranial computed tomography (CT) results. We externally validated 2 decision rules with 100% reported sensitivity for a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage, among patients undergoing lumbar puncture after a negative cranial CT result: (1) clinical rule: presence of any combination of age 40 years and older, neck pain or stiffness, loss of consciousness, or headache onset during exertion; and (2) imaging rule: cranial CT performed within 6 hours of headache onset. METHODS: This was a matched case-control study of patients presenting to 21 emergency departments between 2000 and 2011. Patients with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage as determined by lumbar puncture after a negative cranial CT result were screened for inclusion. A matched control cohort was selected among patients with a diagnosis of headache after negative cranial CT and lumbar puncture results. RESULTS: Fifty-five cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage meeting inclusion criteria were identified, 34 (62%) of which were attributed to cerebral aneurysms. External validation of the clinical rule demonstrated a sensitivity of 97.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 88.6% to 22.7% (95% CI 16.6% to 29.8%), and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.13 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.61) for a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage. External validation of the imaging rule revealed that 11 of 55 subarachnoid hemorrhage cases (20%) had negative cranial CT results for tests performed within 6 hours of headache onset. CONCLUSION: The clinical rule demonstrated useful Bayesian test characteristics when retrospectively validated against this patient cohort. The imaging rule, however, failed to identify 20% of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with Crest Network Investigators Ann Emerg Med. 2013 Jul;62(1):1-10.e1. Epub 2012 Sep 29.

Initiation of Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNFalpha) antagonists and risk of fractures in patients with selected rheumatic and autoimmune diseases OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that initiation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) antagonists reduced the risk of fractures compared to nonbiologic comparators in patients with autoimmune diseases. METHODS: Using 4 large administrative databases, we assembled retrospective cohorts of patients with autoimmune diseases who initiated either a TNFalpha antagonist or a nonbiologic medication. We identified 3 mutually exclusive disease groups: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and a combined group: psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We used baseline covariate data to calculate propensity scores (PS) for each disease group and used Cox regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We compared the risk of combined hip, radius/ulna, humerus, or pelvic fractures between PS-matched cohorts of new users of TNFalpha antagonists and nonbiologic RESULTS: We TNFalpha nonbiologic comparator use in RA, IBD, and PsO-PsA-AS cohorts, respectively. The risk of combined fractures was similar between new users of TNFalpha antagonists and nonbiologic comparators for each disease (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.91-1.51; HR 1.49, 95% CI 0.72-3.11; and 95% CI 0.47-1.82 for RA, IBD, and PsO-PsA-AS, respectively). In RA, the risk of combined fractures was associated with an average daily dosage of prednisone equivalents >10 mg/day at baseline compared with no glucocorticoid (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.03-2.30). CONCLUSION: The risk of fractures did not differ between initiators of a biologic agent and a nonbiologic comparator for any disease studied. Among RA patients, use of >10 mg/day of prednisone equivalents at baseline increased the fracture risk. Authors: Kawai VK; Liu L; Griffin MR; et al.

Incidence and Prevalence of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Among Children in a Managed Care Population, 1996-2009 Few studies based in well-defined North American populations have examined the occurrence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and none has been based in an ethnically diverse population. We used computerized healthcare information from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California membership to validate JIA diagnoses and estimate the incidence and prevalence of the disease in this well-characterized population. We identified children aged ? 15 years with ? 1 relevant International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, diagnosis code of 696.0, 714, or 720 in computerized clinical encounter data during 1996-2009. In a random sample, we then reviewed the medical records to confirm the diagnosis and diagnosis date and to identify the best-performing case-finding algorithms. Finally, we used the case-finding algorithms to estimate the incidence rate and point prevalence of JIA. A diagnosis of JIA was confirmed in 69% of individuals with at least 1 relevant code. Forty-five percent were newly diagnosed during the study period. The age- and sex-standardized incidence rate of JIA per 100,000 person-years was 11.9 (95% CI 10.9-12.9). It was 16.4 (95% CI 14.6-18.1) in girls and 7.7 (95% CI 6.5-8.9) in boys. The peak incidence rate occurred in children aged 11-15 years. The prevalence of JIA per 100,000 persons was 44.7 (95% CI 39.1-50.2) on December 31, 2009. The incidence rate of JIA observed in the Kaiser Permanente population, 1996-2009, was similar to that reported in Rochester, Minnesota, USA, but 2 to 3 times higher than Canadian estimates. Authors: Effectiveness and Reach of the FLU-FIT Program in an Integrated Health Care System: A Multisite Randomized Trial OBJECTIVES: We tested the effectiveness of offering home fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) during influenza vaccination clinics to increase colorectal cancer screening (CRCS). METHODS: In a clinical trial at Kaiser Permanente Northern California influenza clinics in Redwood City, Richmond, South San Francisco, Union City, and Fresno, we randomly assigned influenza clinic dates to intervention (FIT offered) or control (FIT not offered) and compared subsequent CRCS activity. RESULTS: Clinic staff provided FITs to 53.9% (1805/3351) of intervention patients aged 50 to 75 years. In the intent-to-treat analysis, 26.9% (900/3351) and 11.7% (336/2884) of intervention and control patients completed an FIT, respectively, within 90 days of vaccination (P = .001). The adjusted odds ratio for completing FIT in the intervention versus the control arm was 2.75 (95% confidence interval = 2.40, 3.16). In the per protocol analysis, 35.4% (648/1830) of patients given FIT and 13.3% (588/4405) of patients not given FIT completed FIT within 90 days of vaccination (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: This intervention may increase CRCS among those not reached by other forms of CRCS outreach. Future research should include the extent to which these programs can be disseminated and implemented nationally. Authors: Potter MB; Ackerson Am J Public Health. 2013 Jun;103(6):1128-33.

Differences in the clinical recognition of depression in diabetes patients; the diabetes study of northern california (DISTANCE) It is unknown to what extent the gap between need and care for depression among patients with diabetes differs across racial/ethnic groups. We compared, by race/ethnicity, the likelihood of clinical recognition of depression (diagnosis or treatment) of patients who reported depressive symptoms in a well-characterized community-based population with diabetes. We used a survey follow-up study of 20,188 patients with diabetes from Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Analyses were limited to 910 patients who scored 10 or higher on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) which was included in the survey and who had no clinical recognition of depression in the 12 months prior to survey. Clinical recognition of depression was defined by a depression diagnosis, referral to mental health services, or antidepressant medication prescription. Among the 910 patients reporting moderate to severe depressive symptoms on the survey and who had no clinical recognition in the prior year, 12%, 8%, 8%, 14%, and 15% of African American, Asian, Filipino, Latino, and white patients, respectively, were clinically recognized for depression in the subsequent 12 months. After adjusting for sociodemographics, limited English proficiency, and depressive symptom severity, racial/ethnic minorities were less likely to be clinically recognized for depression compared with whites (relative risk: Filipino: 0.30, African American: 0.62). More work is needed to understand the modifiable patient and provider factors that influence clinical recognition of depression among diabetes patients from different racial/ethnic groups, and the potential impact of low rates of clinical recognition on quality of care.

Risk-adjusting Hospital Mortality Using a Comprehensive Electronic Record in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System OBJECTIVE: Using a comprehensive inpatient electronic medical record, we sought to develop a risk-adjustment methodology applicable to all hospitalized patients. Further, we assessed the impact of specific data elements on model discrimination, explanatory power, calibration, integrated discrimination improvement, net reclassification improvement, performance across different hospital units, and hospital rankings. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using logistic regression with split validation. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 248,383 patients who experienced 391,584 hospitalizations between January 1, 2008 and August 31, 2011. SETTING: Twenty-one hospitals in an integrated health care delivery system in Northern California. RESULTS: Inpatient and 30-day mortality rates were 3.02% and 5.09%, respectively. In the validation dataset, the greatest improvement in discrimination (increase in c statistic) occurred with the introduction of laboratory data; however, subsequent addition of vital signs and end-of-life care directive data had significant effects on integrated discrimination improvement, net reclassification improvement, and hospital rankings. Use of longitudinally captured comorbidities did not improve model performance when compared with present-on-admission coding. Our final model for inpatient mortality, which included laboratory test results, vital signs, and care directives, had a c statistic of 0.883 and a pseudo-R of 0.295. Results for inpatient and 30-day mortality were virtually identical. CONCLUSIONS: Risk-adjustment of hospital mortality using comprehensive electronic medical records is feasible and permits one to develop statistical models that better reflect actual clinician experience. In addition, such models can be used to assess hospital performance across specific subpopulations, including patients admitted to intensive care.

Near real-time adverse drug reaction surveillance within population-based health networks: methodology considerations for data accrual PURPOSE: This study describes practical considerations for implementation of near real-time medical product safety surveillance in a distributed health data network. METHODS: We conducted pilot active safety surveillance comparing generic divalproex sodium to historical branded product at four health plans from April to October 2009. Outcomes reported are all-cause emergency room visits and fractures. One retrospective data extract was completed (January 2002-June 2008), followed by seven prospective monthly extracts (January 2008-November 2009). To evaluate delays in claims processing, we used three analytic approaches: near real-time sequential analysis, sequential analysis with 1.5 month delay, and nonsequential (using final retrospective data). Sequential analyses used the maximized sequential probability ratio test. Procedural and logistical barriers to active surveillance were documented. RESULTS: We identified 6586 new users of generic divalproex sodium and 43,960 new users of the branded product. Quality control methods identified 16 extract errors, which were corrected. Near real-time extracts captured 87.5% of emergency room visits and 50.0% of fractures, which improved to 98.3% and 68.7% respectively with 1.5 month delay. We did not identify signals for either outcome regardless of extract timeframe, and slight differences in the test statistic and relative risk estimates were found. CONCLUSIONS: Near real-time sequential safety surveillance is feasible, but several barriers warrant attention. Data quality review of each data extract was necessary. Although signal detection was not affected by delay in analysis, when using a historical control group differential accrual between exposure and outcomes may theoretically bias near real-time risk estimates towards the null, causing failure to detect a signal.

Some Families Who Purchased Health Coverage Through The Massachusetts Connector Wound Up With High Financial Burdens Health insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act will offer coverage to people who lack employer-sponsored insurance or have incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid. However, plans offered through an exchange may include high levels of cost sharing. We surveyed families participating in unsubsidized plans offered in the Massachusetts Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority, an exchange created prior to the 2010 national health reform law, and found high levels of financial burden and higher-than-expected costs among some enrollees. The financial burden and unexpected costs were even more pronounced for families with greater numbers of children and for families with incomes below 400 percent of the federal poverty level. We conclude that those with lower incomes, increased health care needs, and more children will be at particular risk after they obtain coverage through exchanges in 2014. Policy makers should develop strategies to further mitigate the financial burden for enrollees who are most susceptible to encountering higher-than-expected out-of-pocket costs, such as providing cost calculators or Epub 2013-04-17. Drug safety data mining with a tree-based scan statistic PURPOSE: In post-marketing drug safety surveillance, data mining can potentially detect rare but serious adverse events. Assessing an entire collection of drug-event pairs is traditionally performed on a predefined level of granularity. It is unknown a priori whether a drug causes a very specific or a set of related adverse events, such as mitral valve disorders, all valve disorders, or different types of heart disease. This methodological paper evaluates the tree-based scan statistic data mining method to enhance drug safety surveillance. METHODS: We use a three-million-member electronic health records database from the HMO Research Network. Using the tree-based scan statistic, we assess the safety of selected antifungal and diabetes drugs, simultaneously evaluating overlapping diagnosis groups at different granularity levels, adjusting for multiple testing. Expected and observed adverse event counts were adjusted for age, sex, and health plan, producing a log likelihood ratio test statistic. RESULTS: Out of 732 evaluated disease groupings, 24 were statistically significant, divided among 10 non-overlapping disease categories. Five of the 10 signals are known adverse effects, four are likely due to confounding by indication, while one may warrant further investigation. CONCLUSION: The tree-based scan statistic can be successfully applied as a data mining tool in drug safety surveillance using observational data. The total number of statistical signals was modest and does not imply a causal relationship. Rather, data mining results should be used to generate candidate drug-event pairs for rigorous epidemiological studies to evaluate the individual and comparative safety profiles of drugs.

Neighborhood Deprivation and Change in BMI Among Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: The Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) To compare associations between neighborhood deprivation and measures of BMI change among adults with type 2 diabetes. Using data from the Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) survey, we estimated the association between neighborhood deprivation and two measures of BMI change over 3 years: 1) a continuous measure and 2) a categorical measure of clinically substantive BMI loss or gain (?7% of baseline BMI) versus stable BMI. The sample included 13,609 adults. On average, there was little change in BMI (-0.12, SD 3.07); 17.0 and 16.1% had clinically substantive BMI loss or gain, respectively, at follow-up. There was a positive association between neighborhood deprivation and BMI change for adults in the most versus least-deprived quartile of neighborhood deprivation (? = 0.22, P = 0.02) in adjusted models. In addition, relative to the least-deprived quartile (Q1), adults in more-deprived quartiles of neighborhood deprivation were more likely to experience either substantive BMI loss (Q2 relative risk ratio 1.19, 95% CI 1.04-1.49; Q4 1.45, 1.20-1.75). Greater neighborhood deprivation was positively associated with BMI change among adults with diabetes as well as with clinically substantive BMI loss or gain. Findings stress the importance of allowing for simultaneous associations with both gain and loss in future longitudinal studies of neighborhood deprivation and weight change, which may be particularly true for studies of patients with diabetes for whom both weight loss and gain have health implications.

Visitation policies and practices in United States intensive care units Prior reports suggest that restrictive ICU visitation policies can negatively impact patients and their loved ones. However, visitation practices in US ICUs, and the hospital factors associated with them, are not well described. A telephone survey was made of ICUs, stratified by US region and hospital type (community, federal, or university), between 2008 and 2009. Hospital characteristics were self-reported and included the hospitals' bed number, critical care unit number, and presence of ICU leadership. Hospital and ICU visitation restrictions were based on five criteria: visiting hours; visit duration; number of visitors; age of visitors; and membership in the patient's immediate family. Hospitals or ICUs without restrictions had open visitation policies; those with any restriction had restrictive policies. The study surveyed 606 hospitals in the Northeast (17.0%), Midwest (26.2%), South (36.6%), and West (20.1%) regions; most were community hospitals (n = 401, 66.2%). The mean hospital size was 239 \u00b1 217 beds; the mean percentage of ICU beds was 11.6% \u00b1 13.4%. Hospitals often had restrictive hospital (n = 463, 76.4%) and ICU (n = 543, 89.6%) visitation policies. Many ICUs had ? 3 restrictions (n = 375; 61.9%), most commonly related to visiting hours and visitor number or age. Nearly all ICUs allowed visitation exceptions (n = 474; 94.8%). ICUs with open policies were more common in hospitals with < 150 beds. Among restrictive ICUs, the bed size, hospital type, number of critical care units, and ICU leadership were not associated with the number of restrictions. On average, hospitals in the Midwest had the least restrictive policies, while those in the Northeast had the most restrictive. In 2008 the overwhelming majority of US ICUs in this study had restrictive visitation policies. Wide variability in visitation policies suggests that further study into the impact of ICU visitations on care and outcomes remains necessary to standardize practice. Authors: Liu V; Read of time-dependent covariates to a survival model significantly improved predictions for daily risk of hospital death RATIONAL, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The study aims to determine the extent to which the addition of post-admission information via time-dependent covariates improved the ability of a survival model to predict the daily risk of hospital death. METHOD: Using administrative and laboratory data from adult inpatient hospitalizations at our institution between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2009, we fit both a time-dependent and a time-fixed Cox model for hospital mortality on a randomly chosen 66% of hospitalizations. We compared the predictive performance of these models on the remaining hospitalizations. RESULTS: All comparative measures clearly indicated that the addition of time-dependent covariates improved model discrimination and prominently improved model calibration. The time-dependent model had a significantly higher concordance probability (0.879 versus 0.811) and predicted significantly closer to the number of observed deaths within all risk deciles. Over the first 32 admission days, the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement (NRI) were consistently above zero (average IDI of +0.0200 and average NRI of 62.7% over the first 32 days). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of time-dependent covariates significantly improved the ability of a survival model to predict a patient's daily risk of hospital death. Researchers should consider adding time-dependent covariates when seeking to improve the performance of survival models. Authors: Wong J; Taljaard M; Forster Clin Pract. 2013 Apr;19(2):351-7.

Promoting healthy weight with 'stability skills first': A randomized trial Although behavioral weight-loss interventions produce short-term weight loss, long-term maintenance remains elusive. This randomized trial examined whether learning a novel set of \"stability skills\" before losing weight improved long-term weight management. Stability skills were designed to optimize individuals' current satisfaction with lifestyle and self-regulatory habits while requiring the minimum effort and attention necessary. Overweight/obese women (N = 267) were randomly assigned to one of two 6-month interventions and assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months. Maintenance First women participated first in an 8-week stability skills maintenance module and then in a standard 20-week behavioral weight-loss program. Weight Loss First women participated first in a standard 20-week behavioral weight-loss program and then in a standard 8-week problem-solving skills maintenance module. There was no intervention staff contact during the 12-month follow-up period (6-18 months). As designed, Maintenance First participants lost the same percentage of initial weight during the 6-month intervention period as Weight Loss First participants (M = -8.6%, SD = 5.7, vs. M = -9.1%, SD = 6.9; t = -0.6, p = .52). However, Maintenance First participants regained significantly less weight during the 12-month follow-up period (6-18 months) than Weight Loss First participants (M = 3.2 lb, SD = 10.4, vs. M = 7.3 lb, SD = 9.9 [M = 1.4 kg, SD = 4.7, vs. M = 3.3 kg, SD = 4.5]; t = 3.3, p = .001, d = 0.4). Learning stability skills before losing weight was successful in helping women to maintain weight loss without intervention staff contact during follow-up. These results can inform the study design of future innovative interventions. Authors: Kiernan M; Epub 2012-10-29. Impaired Fasting Glucose and Impaired Glucose Tolerance Have Distinct Lipoprotein and Apolipoprotein Changes: The Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study CONTEXT: Cardiovascular risk is increased in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG); however, those with IGT appear to be at greater risk. Lipoprotein abnormalities occur also in the prediabetic state. OBJECTIVE: The authors examined lipoprotein composition in IGT and IFG. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional analysis of a large epidemiological study was done. PARTICIPANTS: The Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study had a total of 1107 participants. MAIN MEASURES: Lipoproteins and apolipoproteins were measured by conventional methods and lipoprotein composition by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: Compared with normal glucose tolerance, apolipoprotein B (105.2 vs 99.8 mg/dL, P < .05) was high in isolated IFG, triglyceride (1.48 vs 1.16 mmol/L, P < .001) was high in isolated IGT, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was low in combined IFG/IGT (1.12 vs 1.26 mmol/L, P < .001). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed additional changes: increased total low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles (1190 vs 1096 nmol/L, P < .01) in isolated IFG; increased large very-low-density lipoprotein (3.61 vs 2.47 nmol/L, P < .01) and small LDL subclass particles (665 vs 541 nmol/L, P < .05) and decreased large LDL subclass particles (447 vs 513 nmol/L, P < .01) in isolated IGT; and decreased large high-density lipoprotein subclass particles in combined IFG/IGT (4.24 vs 5.39 mumol/L, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Isolated IFG is characterized by increased apolipoprotein B and total LDL particles, whereas isolated IGT is associated with increased triglycerides, large very-low-density lipoprotein subclass particles, and structural remodeling of LDL particles. These results may help to explain differences in cardiovascular disease risk in the prediabetic and interstitial lung disease BACKGROUND: Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) agents have been hypothesized to increase the risk of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including its most severe manifestation, pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study among autoimmune disease patients who were members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, 1998-2007. We obtained therapies from pharmacy data and diagnoses of ILD from review of X-ray and computed tomography reports. We compared new users of anti-TNF-alpha agents to new users of non-biologic therapies using Cox proportional hazards analysis to adjust for baseline propensity scores and time-varying use of glucocorticoids. We also made head-to-head comparisons between anti-TNF-alpha agents. RESULTS: Among the 8417 persons included in the analysis, 38 (0.4%) received a diagnostic code for ILD by the end of follow-up, including 23 of 4200 (0.5%) who used anti-TNF-alpha during study follow-up, and 15 of 5423 (0.3%) who used only non-biologic therapies. The age-standardized and gender-standardized incidence rate of ILD, per 100 person-years, was 0.21 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0-0.43] for rheumatoid arthritis and appreciably lower for other autoimmune diseases. Compared with the use of non-biologic therapies, use of anti-TNF-alpha therapy was not associated with a diagnosis of ILD among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95%CI 0.51-2.07), nor did head-to-head comparisons across anti-TNF-alpha agents suggest important differences in risk, although the number of cases available for analysis was limited. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that compared with non-biologic therapies, anti-TNF-alpha therapy does not increase the occurrence of ILD among patients with autoimmune diseases and informs research design of future safety studies of ILD.

Early-onset sepsis: a predictive model based on maternal risk factors PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) is a very low-incidence, but potentially fatal condition among term and late preterm newborns. EOS algorithms based on risk-factor threshold values result in evaluation and empiric antibiotic treatment of large numbers of uninfected newborns, leading to unnecessary antibiotic exposures and maternal/infant separation. Ideally, risk stratification should be quantitative, employ information conserving strategies, and be readily transferable to modern comprehensive electronic medical records. RECENT FINDINGS: We performed a case-control study of infants born at or above 34 weeks' gestation with blood culture-proven EOS. We defined the relationship of established predictors to the risk of EOS, then used multivariate analyses and split validation to develop a predictive model using objective data. The model provides an estimation of sepsis risk that can identify the same proportion of EOS cases by evaluating fewer infants, as compared with algorithms based on subjective diagnoses and cut-off values for continuous predictors. SUMMARY: An alternative approach to EOS risk assessment based only on objective data could decrease the number of infants evaluated and empirically treated for EOS, compared with currently recommended algorithms. Prospective evaluation is needed to determine the accuracy and safety of using the sepsis risk model to guide clinical decision-making. Physicians' Knowledge and Attitudes of Clinical Decision Support in the Electronic Health Record: A Survey-based Study OBJECTIVES: The objective was to investigate clinician knowledge of and attitudes toward clinical decision support (CDS) and its incorporation into the electronic health record (EHR). METHODS: This was an electronic survey of emergency physicians (EPs) within an integrated health care delivery system that uses a complete EHR. Randomly assigned respondents completed one of two questionnaires, both including a hypothetical vignette and self-reported knowledge of and attitudes about CDS. One vignette version included CDS, and the other did not (NCDS). The vignette described a scenario in which a cranial computed tomography (CCT) is not recommended by validated prediction rules (the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network [PECARN] rules). In both survey versions, subjects responded first with their likely approach to evaluation and then again after receiving either CDS (the PECARN prediction rules) or no additional support. Descriptive statistics were used for self-reported responses and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of self-reported knowledge and use of the PECARN rules, as well as use of vignette responses. RESULTS: There were 339 respondents (68% response rate), with 172 of 339 (51%) randomized to the CDS version. Initially, 25% of respondents to each version indicated they would order CCTs. After CDS, 30 of 43 (70%) of respondents who initially would order CCTs changed their management decisions to no CCT versus two of 41 (5%) with the NCDS version (chi-square, p = 0.003). In response to self-report questions, 81 of 338 respondents (24%) reported having never heard of the PECARN prediction rules, 122 of 338 (36%) were aware of the rules but not their specifics, and 135 of 338 (40%) reported knowing the rules and their specifics. Respondents agreed with favorable statements about CDS (75% to 96% agreement across seven statements) and approaches to its implementation into the EHR (60% to 93% agreement across seven statements). In multivariable analyses, EPs with tenure of 5 to 14 years (odds ratio [AOR] = 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.30 to 0.86) and for 15 years or more (AOR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.20 to 0.70) were significantly less likely to report knowing the specifics of the PECARN prediction rules compared with EPs who practiced for fewer than 5 years. In addition, in the initial vignette responses (across both versions), physicians with >/=15 years of ED tenure compared to those with fewer than 5 years of experience (AOR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.69), and those reporting knowing the specifics of the PECARN prediction rules were less likely to order CCTs (AOR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.30 to 0.92). CONCLUSIONS: EPs incorporated pediatric head trauma CDS via the EHR into their clinical judgment in a hypothetical scenario and reported favorable opinions of CDS in general and their inclusion into the EHR.

Genetic susceptibility testing for chronic disease and intention for behavior change in healthy young adults Genetic testing for chronic disease susceptibility may motivate young adults for preventive behavior change. This nationally representative survey gave 521 young adults hypothetical scenarios of receiving genetic susceptibility results for heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and stroke and asked their (1) interest in such testing, (2) anticipated likelihood of improving diet and physical activity with high- and low-risk test results, and (3) readiness to make behavior change. Responses were analyzed by presence of established disease-risk factors. Respondents with high phenotypic diabetes risk reported increased likelihood of improving their diet and physical activity in response to high-risk results compared with those with low diabetes risk (odds ratio (OR), 1.82 (1.03, 3.21) for diet and OR, 2.64 (1.24, 5.64) for physical activity). In contrast, poor baseline diet (OR, 0.51 (0.27, 0.99)) and poor physical activity (OR, 0.53 (0.29, 0.99)) were associated with decreased likelihood of improving diet. Knowledge of genetic susceptibility may motivate young adults with higher personal diabetes risk for improvement in diet and exercise, but poor baseline behaviors are associated with decreased intention to make these changes. To be effective, genetic risk testing in young adults may need to be coupled with other strategies to enable behavior change. Authors: 2013 Apr;4(2):263-71. Epub 2013 Feb 24. Health Literacy and Antidepressant Medication Adherence Among Adults with Diabetes; The Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) Previous studies have reported that health literacy limitations are associated with poorer disease control for chronic conditions, but have not evaluated potential associations with medication adherence. To determine whether health literacy limitations are associated with poorer antidepressant medication adherence. Observational new prescription cohort follow-up study. Adults with type 2 diabetes who completed a survey in 2006 and received a new antidepressant prescription during 2006-2010 (N?=?1,366) at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Validated three-item self-report scale measured health literacy. Discrete indices of adherence based on pharmacy dispensing data according to validated methods: primary non-adherence (medication never dispensed); early non-persistence (dispensed once, never refilled); non-persistence at 180 and 365 days; and new prescription medication gap (NPMG; proportion of time that the person is without medication during 12 months after the prescription date). Seventy-two percent of patients were classified as having health literacy limitations. After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical covariates, patients with health literacy limitations had significantly poorer adherence compared to patients with no limitations, whether measured as early non-persistence (46 % versus 38 %, p < 0.05), non-persistence at 180 days (55 % versus 46 %, p < 0.05), or NPMG (41 % versus 36%, p < 0.01). There were no significant associations with primary adherence or non-persistence at 365 days.Poorer antidepressant adherence among adults with diabetes and health literacy limitations may jeopardize the continuation and maintenance phases of depression pharmacotherapy. Findings underscore the importance of national efforts to address health literacy, simplify health communications regarding treatment options, improve public understanding of depression treatment, and monitor antidepressant adherence.

Association between the initiation of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy and the risk of herpes zoster IMPORTANCE: Herpes zoster reactivation disproportionately affects patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear whether anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy elevates herpes zoster risk. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain whether initiation of anti-TNF therapy compared with nonbiologic comparators is associated with increased herpes zoster risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We identified new users of anti-TNF therapy among cohorts of patients with RA, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis from 1998 through 2007 within a large US multi-institutional collaboration combining data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly, Tennessee Medicaid, and national Medicaid/Medicare programs. We compared herpes zoster incidence between new anti-TNF nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (n=25,742) within each inflammatory disease cohort (last participant follow-up December 31, 2007). Within these cohorts, we used Cox regression models to compare propensity score-adjusted herpes zoster incidence between new anti-TNF and nonbiologic DMARD users while controlling for baseline corticosteroid use. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of herpes zoster cases occurring after initiation of new anti-TNF or nonbiologic DMARD therapy. RESULTS: Among 33,324 new users of anti-TNF therapy, we identified 310 herpes zoster cases. Crude incidence rates among anti-TNF users were 12.1 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI, 10.7-13.6) for RA, 11.3 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI, 7.7-16.7) for inflammatory bowel disease, and 4.4 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI, 2.8-7.0) for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Baseline use of corticosteroids of 10 mg/d or greater among all disease indications was associated with elevated risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.13 [95% CI, 1.64-2.75]) compared with no baseline use. For patients with RA, adjusted incidence rates were similar between anti-TNF and nonbiologic DMARD initiators (adjusted HR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.77-1.29]) and comparable between all 3 anti-TNF therapies studied. Across all disease indications, the adjusted HR was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.88-1.36). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with RA and other inflammatory diseases, those who initiated anti-TNF therapies were not at higher risk of herpes zoster compared with patients who initiated KL; al.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasing in prevalence, in tandem with the U.S. obesity epidemic, in both children and adults. Identifying specific dietary components that drive NASH is important for successful management of this disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Weight loss of 5-10% improves NASH. In addition, fructose and trans-fats, two components of the Western 'fast-food' diet, have unique metabolic effects that suggest they may be key contributors to NASH. However, further research is needed to clarify the utility of restricting these nutrients in treating NASH. SUMMARY: Overall reductions in body weight, through reduced calorie intake and increased physical activity, are the current mainstays of NASH treatment. Reducing fructose and trans-fat intake, independent of weight loss, may be critical to improving or preventing progression of NASH. interpersonal processes of care and perceived social position: The Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) A patient's sense of his/her standing in the social hierarchy may impact interpersonal processes of care (IPC) within the patient-provider encounter. We investigated the association of perceived social position with patient-reported IPC. We used survey data from the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE), studying 11,105 insured patients with diabetes cared for in an integrated healthcare delivery system. Perceived social position was based on the MacArthur subjective social status ladder. Patient-reported IPC was based on a combined scale adapted from the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Study provider communication subscale and the Trust in Physicians scale. Lower perceived social position was associated with poorer reported IPC (p<0.001). The relationship remained statistically significant after controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, depressive symptoms, physical functioning, income and education. Beyond objective measures of SES, patients' sense of where they fall in the social hierarchy may represent a pathway between social position and patient satisfaction with the quality of patient-provider communication in chronic disease. Interventions to address disparities in communication in primary care should incorporate notions of patients' social 2011-08-19. Elevated Rates of Diabetes in Pacific Islanders and Asian Subgroups: The Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) OBJECTIVE: We estimated the prevalence and incidence of diabetes among specific subgroups of Asians and Pacific Islanders (APIs) in a multiethnic U.S. population with uniform access to care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective cohort analysis included 2,123,548 adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, including 1,704,363 with known race/ethnicity (white, 56.9%; Latino, 0.6%; Pacific Islander, 0.5%; South Asian, 0.4%; and Southeast Asian, Korean, and Vietnamese, 0.1% each). We calculated age-standardized (to the 2010 U.S. population) and sex-adjusted diabetes prevalence at baseline and incidence (during the 2010 calendar year). Poisson models were used to estimate relative risks. RESULTS: There were 210,632 subjects with prevalent diabetes as of 1 January 2010 and 15,357 incident cases of diabetes identified during 2010. The crude diabetes prevalence was 9.9% and the incidence was 8.0 cases per 1,000 person-years and, after standardizing by age and sex to the 2010 U.S. Census, 8.9% and 7.7 cases per 1,000 person-years. There was considerable variation among the seven largest API subgroups. Pacific Islanders, South Asians, and Filipinos had the highest prevalence (18.3, 15.9, and 16.1%, respectively) and the highest incidence (19.9, 17.2, and 14.7 cases per 1,000 person-years, respectively) of diabetes among all racial/ethnic groups, including minorities traditionally considered high risk (e.g., African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans). CONCLUSIONS: High rates of diabetes among Pacific Islanders, South Asians, and Filipinos are obscured by much lower rates among the large population of Chinese and several smaller Asian subgroups.

Characteristics of Primary Care Safety-Net Providers and Their Quality Improvement Attitudes and Activities: Results of a National Survey of Physician Professionalism No current national data exist to characterize safety-net physicians and their attitudes toward and participation in quality improvement activities compared with non-safety-net physicians. The authors conducted a national random sample survey of internal medicine, family practice, and pediatrics primary care physicians (PCPs) and used weighted multivariable regression models to assess attitudes and participation in quality improvement activities. After multivariable adjustment, there were no significant differences in provider attitudes about or participation in quality improvement activities between safety-net and non-safety-net physicians. However, safety-net providers were almost twice as likely to look for racial/ethnic disparities in care within their practices and are as likely to be involved in quality improvement activities as non-safety-net providers; their attitudes are consistent with providing equitable and universal care.

Use of an electronic medical record 'dotphrase' data template for a prospective head injury study INTRODUCTION: The adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) in emergency departments (EDs) has changed the way that healthcare information is collected, charted, and stored. A challenge for researchers is to determine how EMRs may be leveraged to facilitate study data collection efforts. Our objective is to describe the use of a unique data collection system leveraging EMR technology and to compare data entry error rates to traditional paper data collection. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of data collection methods during a multicenter study of ED, anti-coagulated, head injury patients. On-shift physicians at 4 centers enrolled patients and prospectively completed data forms. These physicians had the option of completing a paper data form or an electronic 'dotphrase' (DP) data form. A feature of our Epic(R)-based EMR is the ability to use DPs to assist in medical information entry. A DP is a preset template that may be inserted into the EMR when the physician types a period followed by a code phrase (in this case '.ichstudy'). Once the study DP was inserted at the bottom of the electronic ED note, it prompted enrolling physicians to answer study questions. Investigators then extracted data directly from the EMR. RESULTS: From July 2009 through December 2010, we enrolled 883 patients. DP data forms were used in 288 (32.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 29.5, 35.7%) cases and 151 physicians enrolling patients used DP data entry at least once. Using multivariate analysis, we found no association between physician age, gender, or tenure and DP use. Data entry errors were more likely on paper forms (234/595, 39.3%; 95% CI 35.4, 3.7, in CI 27.9, 37.6%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: DP data collection is a feasible means of data collection. DP data forms maintain all study data within the secure EMR environment, obviating the need to maintain and collect paper data forms. This innovation was embraced by many of our emergency physicians and resulted in lower data entry error rates. Med. 2013 Mar;14(2):109-13. Communication and Medication Refill Adherence: The Diabetes Study of Northern California BACKGROUND: Poor medication refill adherence contributes to poor cardiometabolic control and diabetes outcomes. Studies linking communication between patients and health care providers to adherence often use self-reported adherence and have not explored differences across communication domains or therapeutic indications. METHODS: To investigate associations between patient communication ratings and cardiometabolic medication refill adherence, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 9377 patients in the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE), a race-stratified, random sample of Kaiser Permanente survey respondents. Eligible participants received 1 or more oral hypoglycemic, lipid-lowering, or antihypertensive medication in the 12 months preceding the survey. Communication was measured with a 4-item Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey (CAHPS) score and 4 items from the Trust in Physicians and Interpersonal Processes of Care instruments. Poor adherence was classified as greater than a 20% continuous medication gap for ongoing medication therapies. Using modified least squares regression, we calculated differences in poor adherence prevalence for a 10-point decrease in CAHPS score and compared higher vs lower communication ratings on other items, adjusting for necessary sociodemographic and medical confounders derived from a directed acyclic graph. RESULTS: In this cohort, 30% had poor cardiometabolic medication refill adherence. For each 10-point decrease in CAHPS score, the adjusted prevalence of poor adherence increased by 0.9% (P=.01). Compared with patients offering higher ratings, patients who gave health care providers lower ratings for involving patients in decisions, understanding patients' problems with treatment, and eliciting confidence and trust were more likely to have poor adherence, with absolute differences of 4% (P=.04), 5% (P=.02), and 6% (P=.03), respectively. Associations between communication and adherence were somewhat larger for hypoglycemic medications than for other medications. CONCLUSIONS: Poor communication ratings were independently associated with objectively measured inadequate cardiometabolic medication refill adherence, particularly for oral hypoglycemic medications. Future studies should investigate whether improving communication skills among clinicians with poorer patient communication ratings could improve their patients' cardiometabolic medication refill Med. 2013 Feb 11;173(3):210-8. Benefits of Early Hypertension Control on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Diabetes OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of early hypertension (HT) control on occurrence of subsequent major cardiovascular events in those with diabetes and recent-onset HT. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Study subjects were 15,665 adults with diabetes but no diagnosed coronary or cerebrovascular disease at baseline who met standard criteria for new-onset HT. Poisson regression models assessed whether adequate blood pressure control within 1 year of HT onset predicts subsequent occurrence of major cardiovascular events with and without adjustment for baseline Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and other covariates. RESULTS: Mean age was 51.5 years, and mean blood pressure at HT onset was 136.8/80.8 mmHg. In the year after HT onset, mean blood pressure decreased to 131.4/78.0 mmHg and was <130/80 mmHg in 32.9% of <140/90 mmHg in 80.2%. Over a mean follow-up of 3.2 years, age-adjusted rates of major cardiovascular events in those with mean 1-year blood pressure measurements of <130/80, = 0.004). In FRS-adjusted models, rates of major cardiovascular events were significantly higher in those with mean blood pressure >/=140/90 mmHg in the first year after HT onset (rate ratio 1.30 [95% CI 1.01-1.169]; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Failure to adequately control BP within 1 year of HT onset significantly increased the likelihood of major cardiovascular events within 3 years. Prompt control of new-onset HT in patients with diabetes may provide important Diabetes Care. 2013 Feb;36(2):322-7. Epub 2012 Sep 10. Intensification of diabetes medication and risk for 30-day readmission AIM: To examine the association of in-hospital diabetes regimen intensification with subsequent 30-day risk for unplanned readmission/emergency department admission. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 1949 adults with Type 2 diabetes receiving primary care within an academic health network admitted to the hospital between January 2007 and December 2009. Glucose therapy intensification was defined as new start of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents, or addition of prandial insulin or insulin mixtures. The association of glucose therapy intensification with subsequent 30-day risk for unplanned readmission/emergency department admission was examined, with focus on medicine service patients with poorly controlled glycaemia (baseline HbA(1c) >/= 64 mmol/mol). RESULTS: One in six patients (324/1949, 17%) had early readmission/emergency department admission. Compared with patients without early readmission, readmitted patients were more often male (58 vs. 52%, P = 0.03), had higher Charlson co-morbidity score [mean (sd) 3.0 (2.0) vs. 2.8 (1.8), P = 0.02], longer length of stay [5 (4.4) vs. 3.9 (3.3) days, P < 0.01] and were more often discharged home with nursing services (38 vs. 32%, P = 0.03). Overall, glucose therapy intensification was not associated with early hospital readmission/emergency department admission (odds ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.64-1.37, P = 0.74). However, among medicine service patients with baseline HbA(1c) >/= 64 mmol/mol (8%), glucose therapy intensification was associated with a significantly decreased early readmission risk (adjusted odds ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.88, P = 0.03) and decrease (1.4)%], P < 0.01}. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes medical regimen intensification during hospitalization was not associated with early readmission. Among patients with elevated HbA(1c) , glucose therapy intensification was associated with a decreased 30-day readmission/emergency department admission risk and lower outpatient HbA(1c) levels. Our findings support the safety and durable impact of diabetes regimen optimization during hospital admission. Authors: Wei NJ; Wexler DJ; Nathan DM; Risk of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage in patients with head injury and preinjury warfarin use OBJECTIVES: Appropriate use of cranial computed tomography (CT) scanning in patients with mild blunt head trauma and preinjury anticoagulant or antiplatelet use is unknown. The objectives of this study were: 1) to identify risk factors for immediate traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (tICH) in patients with mild head trauma and preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel use and 2) to derive a clinical prediction rule to identify patients at low risk for immediate tICH. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study at two trauma centers and four community hospitals that enrolled adult emergency department (ED) patients with mild blunt head trauma (initial ED Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 13 to 15) and preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel use. The primary outcome measure was immediate tICH, defined as the presence of ICH or contusion on the initial cranial CT. Risk for immediate tICH was analyzed in 11 independent predictor variables. Clinical prediction rules were derived with both binary recursive partitioning and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 982 patients with a mean (+/- standard deviation [SD]) age of 75.4 (+/-12.6) years were included in the analysis. Sixty patients (6.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.7% to 7.8%) had immediate tICH. History of vomiting (relative risk [RR] = 3.53; 95% CI = 1.80 to 6.94), abnormal mental status (RR = 2.85; 95% CI = 1.65 to 4.92), clopidogrel use (RR = 2.52; 95% CI = 1.55 to 4.10), and headache (RR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.11 to 2.96) were associated with an increased risk for immediate tICH. Both binary recursive partitioning and multivariable logistic regression were unable to derive a clinical prediction model that identified a subset of patients at low risk for immediate tICH. CONCLUSIONS: While several risk factors for immediate tICH were identified, the authors were unable to identify a subset of patients with mild head trauma and preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel use who are at low risk for immediate tICH. Thus, the recommendation is for urgent and liberal cranial CT imaging in this patient population, even in the absence of clinical findings.

Health System Factors and Antihypertensive Adherence in a Racially and Ethnically Diverse Cohort of New Users BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify potential health system solutions to suboptimal use of antihypertensive therapy in a diverse cohort of patients initiating treatment. METHODS: Using a hypertension registry at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 44 167 adults (age, >/=18 years) with hypertension who were new users of antihypertensive therapy in 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to model the relationships between race/ethnicity, specific health system factors, and early nonpersistence (failing to refill the first prescription within 90 days) and nonadherence (<80% of days covered during the 12 months following the start of treatment), respectively, controlling for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors. RESULTS: More than 30% of patients were early nonpersistent and 1 in 5 were nonadherent to therapy. Nonwhites were more likely to exhibit both types of suboptimal medication-taking behavior compared with whites. In logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic, clinical, and health system factors, nonwhite race was associated with early nonpersistence (black: [1.31-1.63]). The likelihood of early nonpersistence varied between Asians and Hispanics by choice of first-line therapy. In addition, racial and ethnic differences in nonadherence were appreciably attenuated when medication co-payment and mail-order pharmacy use were accounted for in the models. CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic differences in medication-taking behavior occur early in the course of treatment. However, health system strategies designed to reduce patient co-payments, ease access to medications, and optimize the choice of initial therapy may be effective tools in narrowing persistent gaps in the use of these and other clinically effective therapies.

Mycobacterial diseases and antitumour necrosis factor therapy in USA OBJECTIVE: In North America, tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease rates associated with antitumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) therapy are unknown. METHODS: At Kaiser Permanente Northern California, the authors searched automated pharmacy records to identify inflammatory disease patients who received anti-TNF therapy during 2000-2008 and used validated electronic search algorithms to identify NTM and tuberculosis cases occurring during anti-TNF drug exposure. RESULTS: Of 8418 anti-TNF users identified, 60% had rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Among anti-TNF users, 18 developed NTM and 16 tuberculosis after drug start. Anti-TNF associated rates of NTM and tuberculosis were 74 (95% CI: 37 to 111) and 49 (95% CI: 18 to 79) per 100 000 person-years, respectively. Rates (per 100, 000 person-years) for NTM and tuberculosis respectively for etanercept were 35 (95% CI: 1 to 69) and CI: 0 to 41); infliximab, 116 (95% CI: and 10 to 156); and adalimumab, 122 (95% CI: 3 to 241) and 91 (95% CI: 19 to 267). Background rates for NTM and tuberculosis in unexposed RA-patients were 19.2 (14.2 to 25.0) and 8.7 (5.3 to 13.2), and in the general population were 4.1 (95% CI 3.9 to 4.4) and 2.8 (95% CI 2.6 to 3.0) per 100, 000 person-years. Among anti-TNF users, compared with uninfected individuals, NTM case-patients were older (median age 68 vs 50 years, p<0.01) and more likely to have RA (100% vs 60%, p<0.01); whereas, tuberculosis case-patients were more likely to have diabetes (37% vs 16%, p=0.02) or chronic renal disease (25% p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Among anti-TNF users in USA, mycobacterial disease rates are elevated, and NTM is associated with RA. Authors: Winthrop KL; al. Ann Rheum Jan;72(1):37-42. Epub 2012 Apr 20. Initiation of Anti-TNF Therapy and the Risk of Optic Neuritis; From the Safety Assessment of Biologic ThERapy (SABER) Study PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence of optic neuritis (ON) in patients using anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective, population-based cohort study. METHODS: We identified new users 2000-2007 from the following data sources: Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly, Tennessee Medicaid, and National Medicaid/Medicare. Within this cohort, we used validated algorithms to identify ON cases occurring after onset of new drug exposure. We then calculated and compared ON incidence rates between exposure groups. RESULTS: We identified 61 227 eligible inflammatory disease patients with either new anti-TNF or new nonbiologic DMARD use. Among this cohort, we found 3 ON cases among anti-TNF new users, occurring a median of 123 days (range, 37-221 days) after anti-TNF start. The crude incidence rate of ON across all disease indications among anti-TNF new users was 10.4 (95% CI 3.3-32.2) cases per 100 000 person-years. In a sensitivity analysis considering current or past anti-TNF or DMARD use, we identified a total of 6 ON cases: 3 among anti-TNF users and 3 among DMARD users. Crude ON rates were similar among anti-TNF and DMARD groups: 4.5 (95% CI 1.4-13.8) and per 100 000 person-years, respectively. CONCLUSION: Optic neuritis is rare among those who initiate anti-TNF therapy and occurs with similar frequency among those with DMARD exposure.

The experience of massachusetts shows that consumers will need help in navigating insurance exchanges In 2022 twenty-five million people are expected to purchase health insurance through exchanges to be established under the Affordable Care Act. Understanding how people seek information and make decisions about the insurance plans that are available to them may improve their ability to select a plan and their satisfaction with it. We conducted a survey in 2010 of enrollees in one plan offered through Massachusetts's unsubsidized health insurance exchange to analyze how a sample of consumers selected their plans. More than 40 percent found plan information difficult to understand. Approximately one-third of respondents had help selecting plans-most commonly from friends or family members. However, one-fifth of respondents wished they had had help narrowing plan choices; these enrollees were more likely to report negative experiences related to plan understanding, satisfaction with affordability and coverage, and unexpected costs. Some may have been eligible for subsidized plans. Exchanges may need to provide more resources and decision-support tools to improve consumers' experiences in selecting 2013 Jan;32(1):78-86. An electronic simplified acute physiology score-based risk adjustment score for critical illness in an integrated healthcare system* OBJECTIVE: Risk adjustment is essential in evaluating the performance of an ICU; however, assigning scores is time-consuming. We sought to create an automated ICU risk adjustment score, based on the Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3, using only data available within the electronic medical record (Kaiser Permanente HealthConnect). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The eSimplified Acute Physiology Score 3 was developed by adapting Kaiser Permanente HealthConnect structured data to Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 criteria. The model was tested among 67,889 first-time ICU admissions at 21 hospitals between 2007 and 2011 to predict hospital mortality. Model performance was evaluated using published Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 global and North American coefficients; a first-level customized version of the eSimplified Acute Physiology Score 3 was also developed in a 40% derivation cohort and tested in a 60% validation cohort. MEASUREMENTS: Electronic variables were considered 'directly' available if they could be mapped exactly within Kaiser Permanente HealthConnect; they were considered 'adapted' if no exact electronic corollary was identified. Model discrimination was evaluated with area under receiver operating characteristic curves; calibration was assessed using Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests. MAIN RESULTS: Mean age at ICU admission was 65 +/- 17 yrs. Mortality in the ICU was 6.2%; total in-hospital mortality was 11.2%. The majority of Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 variables were considered 'directly' available; others required adaptation based on diagnosis coding, medication records, or procedure tables. Mean eSimplified Acute Physiology Score 3 scores were 45 +/- 13. Using published Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 global and North American coefficients, the eSimplified Acute Physiology Score 3 demonstrated good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.80-0.81); however, it overpredicted mortality. The customized eSimplified Acute Physiology Score 3 score demonstrated good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.82) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit chi-square p = 0.57) in the validation cohort. The eSimplified Acute Physiology Score 3 demonstrated stable performance when cohorts were limited to specific hospitals and years. CONCLUSIONS: The customized eSimplified Acute Physiology Score 3 shows good potential for providing automated risk adjustment in the intensive care unit. Authors: Liu Cancer: Long-term, Persistent Ostomy-Specific Concerns and Adaptations The purpose of this article was to describe persistent ostomy-specific concerns and adaptations in long-term (>5 years) colorectal cancer survivors with ostomies. Thirty-three colorectal cancer survivors who participated in 8 gender- and health-related quality of life stratified focus groups and 130 colorectal cancer survivors who provided written comments to 2 open-ended questions on ostomy location and pouch problems participated in the study. Data were collected on health maintenance organization members in Oregon, southwestern Washington, and northern California. Qualitative data were analyzed for the 8 focus groups and written comments from 2 open-ended survey questions. Discussions from the focu s groups were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using content analysis. Written content from the open-ended questions was derived from a mailed questionnaire on health-related quality of life in survivors with ostomies and analyzed using content analysis. Discussions related to persistent ostomy-related issues more than 5 years after formation were common. Persistent ostomy-related issues were focused on clothing restrictions and adaptations, dietary concerns, issues related to ostomy equipment and self-care, and the constant need to find solutions to adjust and readjust to living with an ostomy. Ostomy-specific concerns persist 5 years and more for long-term colorectal cancer survivors after initial ostomy formation. Adaptations tend to be individualized and based on trial and error. Findings underscore the need to develop long-term support mechanisms that survivors can access to promote better coping and adjustment to living with an ostomy. Nurs. 2013 Jan-Feb;40(1):61-72. Personalized Genetic Risk Counseling to Motivate Diabetes Prevention: A randomized trial OBJECTIVE: To examine whether diabetes genetic risk testing and counseling can improve diabetes prevention behaviors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial of diabetes genetic risk counseling among overweight patients at increased phenotypic risk for type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomly allocated to genetic testing versus no testing. Genetic risk was calculated by summing 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes. Participants in the top and bottom score quartiles received individual genetic counseling before being enrolled with untested control participants in a 12-week, validated, diabetes prevention program. Middle-risk quartile participants were not studied further. We examined the effect of this genetic counseling intervention on patient self-reported attitudes, program attendance, and weight loss, separately comparing higher-risk and lower-risk result recipients with control participants. RESULTS: The 108 participants enrolled in the diabetes prevention program included 42 participants at higher diabetes genetic risk, 32 at lower diabetes genetic risk, and 34 untested control subjects. Mean age was 57.9 +/- 10.6 years, 61% were men, and average BMI was 34.8 kg/m(2), with no differences among randomization groups. Participants attended 6.8 +/- 4.3 group sessions and lost 8.5 +/- 10.1 pounds, with 33 of 108 (30.6%) losing >/=5% body weight. There were few statistically significant differences in self-reported motivation, program attendance, or mean weight loss when higher-risk recipients and lower-risk recipients were compared with control subjects (P > 0.05 for all but one comparison). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes genetic risk counseling with currently available variants does not significantly alter self-reported motivation or prevention program adherence for overweight individuals at risk for diabetes.

Health-Plan and Employer-Based Wellness Programs to Reduce Diabetes Risk: The Kaiser Permanente Northern California NEXT-D Study Primary prevention of diabetes is increasingly recognized by both health plans and employers as an important strategy to improve the health of insured populations. As a part of the Natural Experiments in Translation for Diabetes (NEXT-D) network, the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Division of Research is assessing the effectiveness of 2 health plan-initiated programs to prevent the onset of diabetes in patients at high risk. The first study evaluates a telephonic health-coaching program that provides counseling on healthful eating, active living, and weight loss to KPNC members. The second evaluation examines a postpartum glucose screening and educational diabetes prevention program for women with gestational diabetes mellitus that KPNC implemented in 2006. Identifying effective approaches to preventing diabetes will be of value to health care systems, policy makers, and public health officials seeking to understand the roles systems and employers can play in preventing chronic illness.

Patient Satisfaction and Perceived Success with a Telephonic Health Coaching Program: The Natural Experiments for Translation in Diabetes (NEXT-D) Study, Northern California, 2011 Health coaching can improve lifestyle behaviors known to prevent or manage chronic conditions such as diabetes. However, little is known about the patient experience with telephonic coaching programs in real-world care settings. We examined patient satisfaction, patient's perceived success in achieving program goals, and the patient-level correlates of these outcomes in a voluntary telephonic coaching program at a large integrated health care delivery system in northern California. Kaiser Permanente Northern California patients who participated in a telephonic coaching program in 2011 were sent a cross-sectional survey about their satisfaction with health coaching and perceived success with program goals. We examined associations with patient characteristics. The survey response rate was 34%; analyses were based on the 32% who completed the survey. Of those who had completed 2 or more sessions (n = 232 [52%]), most reported being satisfied (70%) or neutral (20%) with the program, and 71% would recommend health coaching. Healthy weight, healthful eating, and physical activity were the most common topics discussed (88%). Adjusting for demographic characteristics, 73% of those who had 2 or more sessions reported that health coaching helped achieve their weight-related goal. Outcomes were positively correlated with patient activation but not consistently correlated with patient demographic characteristics. Levels of satisfaction and perceived success with telephonic health coaching provided by a health plan were high and positively correlated with the number of sessions completed and patient activation. Voluntary telephonic health coaching programs should promote retention and assess patients' 2013-10-31. Drug Adverse Event Detection in Health Plan Data Using the Gamma Poisson Shrinker and Comparison to the Tree-based Scan Statistic Background: Drug adverse event (AE) signal detection using the Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS) is commonly applied in spontaneous reporting. AE signal detection using large observational health plan databases can expand medication safety surveillance. Methods: Using data from nine health plans, we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the implementation and findings of the GPS approach for two antifungal drugs, terbinafine and itraconazole, and two diabetes drugs, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. We evaluated 1676 diagnosis codes grouped into 183 different clinical concepts and four levels of granularity. Several signaling thresholds were assessed. GPS results were compared to findings from a companion study using the identical analytic dataset but an alternative statistical method-the tree-based scan statistic (TreeScan). Results: We identified 71 statistical signals across two signaling thresholds and two methods, including closely-related signals of overlapping diagnosis definitions. Initial review found that most signals represented known adverse drug reactions or confounding. About 31% of signals met the highest signaling threshold. Conclusions: The GPS method was successfully applied to observational health plan data in a distributed data environment as a drug safety data mining method. There was substantial concordance between the GPS and TreeScan approaches. Key method implementation decisions relate to defining exposures and outcomes and informed choice of signaling thresholds. Authors: Brown JS; Pawloski PA; Decreased postoperative endophthalmitis rate after institution of intracameral antibiotics in a Northern California eye department PURPOSE: To evaluate post-cataract-surgery endophthalmitis rates in relation to changing practice patterns in antibiotic administration. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente, Diablo Service Area, California. DESIGN: Ecological time-trend study. METHODS: During 2007 through 2011, 3 time periods were identified based on increasing adoption of intracameral injections after phacoemulsification cataract surgery. In 2007, patients primarily received postoperative antibiotic drops without intracameral injection. During 2008 and 2009, in addition to the surgeons' usual postoperative topical drop regimen, patients received intracameral cefuroxime unless contraindicated by allergy or posterior capsule rupture (PCR). During 2010 and 2011, all patients received an intracameral injection of cefuroxime, moxifloxacin, or vancomycin while topical antibiotics were used according to surgeon preference. The rates of postoperative endophthalmitis during these 3 periods were calculated. Also evaluated separately were consecutive patients without PCR from a subgroup of 3 surgeons who used intracameral injection alone without perioperative topical antibiotics. RESULTS: Nineteen cases of endophthalmitis occurred in 16,264 cataract surgeries. The respective rates per 1000 during the 3 time periods (2007, 2008 and 2009, 2010 and 2011) were as follows: 3.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-5.93); 1.43 (95% 0.14 (95% CI, 0-0.78). One case of endophthalmitis was observed in 2038 patients without PCR who received intracameral injection only without topical antibiotics (rate per 1000: 0.49; 95% CI, 0.01-2.73). CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of intracameral antibiotic injection coincided with a decline in the rate of postoperative endophthalmitis, and a low infection rate was observed alone. Epub 2012 Oct 2. Risk factors for unplanned transfer to intensive care within 24 hours of admission from the emergency department in an integrated healthcare system BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) ward admissions subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 24 hours have higher mortality than direct ICU admissions. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS: Describe risk factors for unplanned ICU transfer within 24 hours of ward arrival from the ED. METHODS: Evaluation of 178,315 ED non-ICU admissions to 13 US community hospitals. We tabulated the outcome of unplanned ICU transfer by patient characteristics and hospital volume. We present factors associated with unplanned ICU transfer after adjusting for patient and hospital differences in a hierarchical logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 4,252 (2.4%) non-ICU admissions transferred to the ICU within 24 hours. Admitting diagnoses most associated with unplanned transfer, listed by descending prevalence were: pneumonia (odds ratio [OR] 1.5; CI 1.1-1.9), sepsis (OR 2.3; 1.7-3.0). Other significant predictors included: male sex, Comorbidity Points Score >145, Laboratory Acute Physiology Score >/=7, arriving on the ward between 11 PM and 7 AM. Decreased risk was found with admission to monitored transitional care units (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.77-0.90) and to higher volume hospitals (OR 0.94 per 1,000 additional annual ED inpatient admissions; 95% CI 0.91-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: ED patients admitted with respiratory conditions, MI, or sepsis are at modestly increased risk for unplanned ICU transfer and may benefit from better triage from the ED, earlier intervention, or closer monitoring to prevent acute decompensation. More research is needed to determine how intermediate care units, hospital volume, time of day, and sex affect unplanned ICU transfer. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2013.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor therapy and cancer risk in chronic immune mediated diseases OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of cancer following tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) inhibitor therapy to that with commonly used alternative therapies across multiple immune-mediated diseases. METHODS: The Safety Assessment of Biological Therapeutics study used data from 4 sources: national Medicaid and Medicare databases, Tennessee Medicaid, pharmacy benefits plans for Medicare beneficiaries in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Propensity score-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were computed to estimate the relative rates of cancer, comparing those treated with TNFalpha inhibitors to those treated with alternative disease-modifying therapies. The cancer-finding algorithm had a positive predictive value ranging from 31% for any leukemia to 89% for female breast cancer. RESULTS: We included 29,555 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (13,102 person-years), 6,357 patients with inflammatory with psoriasis (371 person-years), and 2,498 patients with psoriatic arthritis (618 person-years). The incidence of any solid cancer was not elevated in RA (HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.59-1.08]), inflammatory bowel disease (HR psoriasis during TNFalpha inhibitor therapy compared to disease-specific alternative therapy. Among RA patients, the incidence of any of the 10 most common cancers in the US and of nonmelanoma skin cancer was not increased with TNFalpha inhibitor therapy compared to treatment with comparator drugs. CONCLUSION: Short-term cancer risk was not elevated among patients treated with TNFalpha inhibitor therapy relative to commonly used therapies for immune- mediated chronic inflammatory diseases in this study.

Variation in vitamin D supplementation among adults in a multi-race/ethnic health plan population, 2008 BACKGROUND: Vitamin D may have a role in many chronic conditions in addition to bone health. Nutritional surveys among Americans have reported high levels of vitamin D insufficiency, especially among Blacks and Latinos. Our study examined variation in vitamin D supplementation practices in an adult health plan population by age, gender, and race-ethnicity. METHODS: Self-report data from a 2008 general health survey in a large Northern California health plan were used to characterize number and types of sources of vitamin D supplementation (multivitamin, calcium with D, singular D) among women and men aged 25-85, overall, by race-ethnicity, and for obese, diabetic, and hypertensive subgroups. RESULTS: In this population, 40% of women and 54% of men = 50, and 24% of women and 53% of men aged 51-85 get no vitamin D from dietary supplements. Higher vitamin D supplementation among women > 50 is associated with higher reported intake of calcium with D. Black and Latina women aged 25-85 and Filipinas in the = 50 age group were significantly less likely than non-Hispanic Whites to get vitamin D from supplements, whereas vitamin D supplementation practices among Chinese women did not significantly differ from non-Hispanic Whites. Among men, Latinos aged 25-85 and Black and Chinese = 50 were significantly less likely than non-Hispanic Whites to get vitamin D from supplements. Similar race-ethnic differences in vitamin D supplementation patterns were observed for people in the obese, diabetic, and hypertensive groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey results suggest that in 2008, a large percentage of women and an even larger percentage of men in a large Northern California health plan get no vitamin D from dietary supplements, and that Blacks and Latinos and obese adults, who are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, are also the least likely to get any vitamin D from dietary supplements.

Detection and recognition of hypertension in anxious and depressed patients OBJECTIVE:: Hypertension management requires detection (i.e. confirmation of persistently high blood pressure (BP) after an initial elevated measurement) and recognition of the condition (evidenced by a formal diagnosis and/or initiation of treatment). Our objective was to determine whether disparities exist in detection of elevated BP and recognition (i.e. diagnosis or treatment) of hypertension in patients with depression and anxiety. METHODS:: Using data from the Cardiovascular Research Network Hypertension Registry, we assessed time-to-detection of elevated BP and recognition of hypertension in patients with comorbid anxiety and depression compared with patients with neither disorder. We performed multivariable survival analysis of time to detection and recognition in patients who entered the registry in 2002-2006. We adjusted for primary care visit rate and other relevant clinical factors. RESULTS:: In 168 630 incident hypertension patients, detection occurred earlier among patients with anxiety and depression compared with patients without these diagnoses [adjusted hazard ratio for anxiety and depression 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-1.35]. Recognition of hypertension within 12 months of the second elevated BP was similar (adjusted hazard ratio for anxiety and depression 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-1.00) or delayed (adjusted hazard ratio for anxiety 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.99 and for depression 0.93, 95% CI 0.90-0.97). CONCLUSIONS:: Detection of elevated BP occurred earlier in patients with anxiety and depression. Time from detection to diagnosis or treatment was similar or delayed in patients with and without these diagnoses. Our findings suggest that as-yet-unidentified factors contribute to disparities in hypertension detection and recognition. PJ J Hypertens. 2012 Dec;30(12):2293-8. Symptom Burden of Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Across the Disease Course: Diabetes & Aging Study BACKGROUND: Reducing symptom burden is paramount at the end-of-life, but typically considered secondary to risk factor control in chronic disease, such as diabetes. Little is known about the symptom burden experienced by adults with type 2 diabetes and the need for symptom palliation. OBJECTIVE: To examine pain and non-pain symptoms of adults with type 2 diabetes over the disease course - at varying time points before death and by age. DESIGN: Survey follow-up study. PARTICIPANTS: 13,171 adults with type 2 diabetes, aged 30-75 years, from Kaiser Permanente, Northern California, who answered a baseline symptom survey in 2005-2006. MAIN MEASURES: Pain and non-pain symptoms were identified by self-report and medical record data. Survival status from baseline was categorized into = 6, >6-24, or alive >24 months. KEY RESULTS: Mean age was 60 years; 48 % were women, and 43 % were non-white. Acute pain was prevalent (41.8 %) and 39.7 % reported chronic pain, 24.6 % fatigue, 23.7 % neuropathy, 23.5 % depression, 24.2 % insomnia, and 15.6 % physical/emotional disability. Symptom burden was prevalent in all survival status categories, but was more prevalent among those with shorter survival, p< .001. Adults >/= 60 years who were alive >24 months reported more physical symptoms such as acute pain and dyspnea, whereas participants <60 years reported more psychosocial symptoms, such as depressed mood and insomnia. Adjustment for duration of diabetes and comorbidity reduced the association between age and pain, but did not otherwise change our results. CONCLUSIONS: In a diverse cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes, pain and non-pain symptoms were common among all patients, not only among those near the end of life. However, symptoms were more prevalent among patients with shorter survival. Older adults reported more physical symptoms, whereas younger adults reported more psychosocial symptoms. Diabetes care management should include not only good cardiometabolic control, but also symptom palliation across the Gen Intern Med. 2012 Dec;27(12):1674-81. Epub 2012 Aug 2. In consumer-directed health plans, a majority of patients were unaware of free or low-cost preventive care Consumer-directed health plans are plans with high deductibles that typically require patients to bear no out-of-pocket costs for preventive care, such as annual physicals or screening tests, in order to ease financial barriers and encourage patients to seek such care. We surveyed people in California who had a consumer-directed health plan and found that fewer than one in five understood that their plan exempted preventive office visits, medical tests, and screenings from their deductible, meaning that this care was free or had a modest copayment. Roughly one in five said that they had delayed or avoided a preventive office visit, test, or screening because of cost. Those who were confused about the exemption were significantly more likely to report avoiding preventive visits because of cost concerns. Special efforts to educate consumers about preventive care cost-sharing exemptions may be necessary as more health plans, including Medicare, adopt this model.

Association between anti-TNF-alpha therapy and all-cause mortality PURPOSE: To compare mortality among patients with selected autoimmune diseases treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) agents with similar patients treated with non-biologic therapies. METHODS: Cohort study set within several large health care programs, 1998-2007. Autoimmune disease patients were identified using diagnoses from computerized healthcare data. Use of anti-TNF-alpha agents and comparison of non-biologic therapies were identified from pharmacy data, and mortality was identified from vital records and other sources. We compared new users of anti-TNF-alpha agents to new users of non-biologic therapies using propensity scores and Cox proportional hazards analysis to adjust for baseline differences. We also made head-to-head comparisons among anti-TNF-alpha agents. RESULTS: Among the 46 424 persons included in the analysis, 2924 (6.3%) had died by the end of follow-up, including 1754 (6.1%) of the 28 941 with a dispensing of anti-TNF-alpha agent and 1170 (6.7%) of the 17 483 who used non-biologic treatment alone. Compared to use of non-biologic therapies, use of anti-TNF-alpha therapy was not associated with an increased mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.93 with 95% (CI) ankylosing spondylitis (combined aHR 0.81 with CI 0.61-1.06; or inflammatory bowel disease (aHR 1.12 with CI 0.85-1.46). Mortality rates did not differ to an important degree between patients treated with etanercept, adalimumab, or infliximab. CONCLUSION: Anti-TNF-alpha therapy was not associated with increased mortality among patients with autoimmune diseases. Authors: Saf. 2012 Dec;21(12):1311-20. Epub 2012 Oct 15. Direct medical expenditure associated with rheumatoid arthritis in a nationally representative sample from the medical expenditure panel survey OBJECTIVE: To quantify the incremental direct medical expenditure associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the US population from a payer's perspective. METHODS: A probability-weighted sample of adult respondents from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2008) was used to identify a cohort of patients with RA and compared to a control cohort without RA. Annual expenditure outcomes, including total expenditure and subgroups related to pharmacy, office-based visits, emergency department visits, hospital inpatient stays, and residual expenditures were estimated. Differences between the RA and control cohort were adjusted for sociodemographic factors, employment status, insurance coverage, health behavior, and health status using a generalized linear model with log link and gamma distribution. Statistical inferences on difference in expenditures between RA and non-RA controls were based on nonparametric cluster bootstrapping using percentiles. RESULTS: The adjusted average annual total expenditure of the RA cohort in 2008 US dollars (USD) was $13,012 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] $1,737-$47,081), while that of the control cohort was $4,950 (95% CI $567-$17,425). The incremental total expenditure of the RA patients as compared to non-RA controls was $2,085 (95% CI $250-$7,822). RA patients also had a significantly higher pharmacy expenditure of $5,825 (95% CI $446-$30,998) that was on average $1,380 (95% CI $94-$7,492) higher as compared to the controls. The summated total incremental expenditure of all RA patients in the US was $22.3 billion (2008 USD). CONCLUSION: RA exerts considerable incremental economic burden on US health care, which is primarily driven by the incremental pharmacy expenditure. Authors: The association of psoriasis with autoimmune diseases BACKGROUND: Previous studies provide evidence that there is a greater frequency of autoimmune diseases among patients with psoriasis than in the general population. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the association between psoriasis and 21 common autoimmune diseases, specified a priori. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among persons who were members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California from 2004 to 2011. A total of 25,341 patients with 2 or more diagnosis codes for any psoriatic disease were evaluated. Five persons not meeting this case definition were matched to each psoriatic patient based on age, sex, and length of enrollment. RESULTS: Patients with psoriasis were more likely to have at least 1 other autoimmune disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-1.7) and to have at least 2 other autoimmune diseases (1.9; 95% CI 1.6-2.4). Of the 17 conditions evaluated, associations with 14 were found to be statistically significant. The strongest association was with rheumatoid arthritis (3.6; 95% CI 3.4-3.9). LIMITATIONS: Patients with autoimmune conditions are likely to have a greater number of health care encounters, which may result in overascertainment and misascertainment of immune-mediated conditions, although the patients included in the study averaged 5.2 years of observation and the comparison subjects were matched on length of enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests a genetic or environmental cause common across autoimmune diseases. Further investigation of individuals with multiple autoimmune diseases may yield important clues about the origin and pathogenesis of the disease. Authors: Wu Epub 2012 Jun 2. Adverse outcomes associated with delayed intensive care unit transfers in an integrated healthcare system BACKGROUND: Patients with intensive care unit (ICU) transfers from hospital wards have higher mortality than those directly admitted from the emergency department. OBJECTIVE: To describe the association between the timing of unplanned ICU transfers and hospital outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS: Evaluation of 6369 early (within 24 hours of hospital admission) unplanned ICU transfer cases and matched directly admitted ICU controls from an integrated healthcare system. Cohorts were matched by predicted mortality, age, gender, diagnosis, and admission characteristics. Hospital mortality of cases and controls were compared based on elapsed time and diagnosis. RESULTS: More than 5% of patients admitted through the emergency department experienced an unplanned ICU transfer; the incidence and rates of transfers were highest within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. Multivariable matching produced 5839 (92%) case-control pairs. Median length of stay was higher among cases (5.0 days) than controls (4.1 days, P < 0.01); mortality was also higher among cases (11.6%) than controls (8.5%, P < 0.01). Patients with early unplanned transfers were at an increased risk of death (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.64; P < 0.01); an increased risk of death was observed even among patients transferred within 8 hours of hospitalization. Hospital mortality differed based on admitting diagnosis categories. While it was higher among cases admitted for respiratory infections and gastrointestinal bleeding, it was not different for those with acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Early unplanned ICU transfers-even within 8 hours of hospitalization-are associated with increased mortality; outcomes vary by elapsed time to transfer and admitting diagnosis.

Outpatient electronic health records and the clinical care and outcomes of patients with diabetes mellitus BACKGROUND: Physicians can receive federal payments for meaningful use of complete certified electronic health records (EHRs). Evidence is limited on how EHR use affects clinical care and outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between use of a commercially available certified EHR and clinical care processes and disease control in patients with diabetes. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental design with outpatient EHR implementation sequentially across 17 medical centers. Multivariate analyses adjusted for patient characteristics, medical center, time trends, and facility-level clustering. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated delivery system. PATIENTS: 169 711 patients with diabetes mellitus. INTERVENTION: Use of a commercially available certified EHR. MEASUREMENTS: Drug treatment intensification and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) testing and values. RESULTS: Use of an EHR was associated with statistically significant improvements in treatment intensification after HbA1c values of 9% or greater (odds ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.15]) or LDL-C values of 2.6 to 3.3 mmol/L (100 to 129 mg/dL) (odds ratio, 1.06 [CI, 1.00 1.12]); increases in 1-year retesting for HbA1c and LDL-C levels among all patients, with the most dramatic change among patients with the worst disease control (HbA1c levels >/=9% or HbA1c levels less than 7% or LDL-C levels less than 2.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL). The EHR was also associated with statistically significant reductions in HbA1c and LDL-C levels, with the largest reductions among patients with the worst control (0.06-mmol/L [2.19-mg/dL] reduction among patients with baseline [>/=130 mg/dL]; P < 0.001). LIMITATION: The EHR was implemented in a setting with strong baseline performance on cardiovascular care quality measures. CONCLUSION: Use of a commercially available certified EHR was associated with improved drug treatment intensification, monitoring, and physiologic control among patients with diabetes, with greater improvements among patients with worse control and less testing in patients already meeting guideline-recommended glycemic and lipid targets.

Genetic Counseling as a Tool for Type 2 Diabetes Prevention: A Genetic Counseling Framework for Common Polygenetic Disorders Advances in genetic epidemiology have increased understanding of common, polygenic preventable diseases such as type 2 diabetes. As genetic risk testing based on this knowledge moves into clinical practice, we propose that genetic counselors will need to expand their roles and adapt traditional counseling techniques for this new patient set. In this paper, we present a genetic counseling intervention developed for a clinical trial [Genetic Counseling/Lifestyle Change for Diabetes Prevention, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01034319] designed to motivate behavioral changes for diabetes prevention. Seventy-two phenotypically high-risk participants received counseling that included their diabetes genetic risk score, general education about diabetes risk factors, and encouragement to participate in a diabetes prevention program. Using two validated genetic counseling scales, participants reported favorable perceived control and satisfaction with the counseling session. Our intervention represents one model for applying traditional genetic counseling principles to risk testing for polygenetic, preventable diseases, such as type Oct;21(5):684-91. practices in long-term survivors of colorectal cancer with colostomies For some patients diagnosed with rectal cancer, surgery will involve the creation of a temporary or permanent ostomy. When the colostomy is located in the sigmoid or descending colon, regulation of fecal output can occur through irrigation, a procedure that involves instilling fluid into the bowel to flush out gas and fecal material. When successfully used, irrigation can prevent fecal output between irrigations, providing some control over colostomy output. The purpose of this article is to describe participants of a large, multisite, multi-investigator study of health-related quality of life in long-term colorectal cancer survivors who answered questions about colostomy irrigation and reported the potential advantages and disadvantages of the procedure. The article also will explore healthcare professionals' role in ensuring patients and family members are educated and well informed about their options regarding temporary or permanent Was the Carrot Enticing Enough? OBJECTIVE: To help preserve continuity of health insurance coverage during the recent recession, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided a 65 percent Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) premium subsidy for workers laid off in 2008-2010. We examined COBRA enrollment levels with the subsidy and the health, access, and financial consequences of enrollment decisions. STUDY DESIGN/DATA COLLECTION: Telephone interviews linked with health system databases for 561 respondents who were laid off in 2009 and eligible for the COBRA subsidy (80 percent response rate). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Overall, 38 percent reported enrolling in COBRA and 54 percent reported having some gaps in insurance coverage since being laid off. After adjustments, we found that those who had higher cost-sharing, who had higher incomes, were older, or were sicker were more likely to enroll in COBRA. COBRA enrollees less frequently reported access problems or that their health suffered because of poor access, but they reported greater financial stress due to health care spending. CONCLUSION: Despite the substantial subsidy, a majority of eligible individuals did not enroll in COBRA, and many reported insurance coverage gaps. Nonenrollees reported more access problems and that their health worsened. Without a mandate, subsidies may need to be widely publicized and larger to encourage health insurance enrollment among individuals who suffer a negative income shock.

Risk of preterm delivery in non-diabetic women with polycystic ovarian syndrome OBJECTIVE: To examine the risk and etiology of preterm delivery in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study comparing preterm delivery rate among non-diabetic PCOS and non-PCOS women with singleton pregnancy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of preterm delivery among PCOS women. RESULT: Among 908 PCOS women with singleton pregnancy, delivered preterm compared with 7.4% among non-PCOS women (P<0.01). Causes of preterm delivery (9%) intrauterine fetal demise (5%). age, race/ethnicity and nulliparity were significant predictors of preterm delivery in PCOS, whereas body mass index and fertility medications were not. CONCLUSION: A higher proportion of PCOS women delivered preterm (12.9%) compared with non-PCOS women, with the majority of cases due to spontaneous preterm birth. Future studies should explore etiologies and strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes in Perinatol. 2012 Oct;32(10):770-6. Epub 2012 Jan 19. Effects of an online personal health record on medication accuracy and safety: a cluster-randomized trial OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a personal health record (PHR)-linked medications module on medication accuracy and safety. DESIGN: From September 2005 to March 2007, we conducted an on-treatment sub-study within a cluster-randomized trial involving 11 primary care practices that used the same PHR. Intervention practices received access to a medications module prompting patients to review their documented medications and identify discrepancies, generating 'eJournals' that enabled rapid updating of medication lists during subsequent clinical visits. MEASUREMENTS: A sample of 267 patients who submitted medications eJournals was contacted by phone 3 weeks after an eligible visit and compared with a matched sample of 274 patients in control practices that received a different PHR-linked intervention. Two blinded physician adjudicators determined unexplained discrepancies between documented and patient-reported medication regimens. The primary outcome was proportion of medications per patient with unexplained discrepancies. RESULTS: Among 121,046 patients in eligible practices, 3979 participated in the main trial and 541 participated in the sub-study. The proportion of medications per patient with unexplained discrepancies was 42% in the intervention arm and 51% in the control arm (adjusted OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.94, p=0.01). The number of unexplained discrepancies per patient with potential for severe harm was 0.03 in the intervention arm and 0.08 in the control arm (adjusted RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.92, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: When used, concordance between documented and patient-reported medication regimens and reduction in potentially harmful medication discrepancies can be improved with a PHR medication review tool linked to the provider's medical record.

Does primary stroke center certification change ED diagnosis, utilization, and disposition of patients with acute stroke? BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We examined the impact of primary stroke center (PSC) certification on emergency department (ED) use and outcomes within an integrated delivery system in which EDs underwent staggered certification. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 30 461 patients seen in 17 integrated delivery system EDs with a primary diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA), intracranial hemorrhage, or ischemic stroke between 2005 and 2008 was conducted. We compared ED stroke patient visits across hospitals for (1) temporal trends and (2) pre- and post-PSC certification-using logistic and linear regression models to adjust for comorbidities, patient characteristics, and calendar time, to examine major outcomes (ED throughput time, hospital admission, radiographic imaging utilization and throughput, and mortality) across certification stages. RESULTS: There were 15 687 precertification ED visits and 11 040 postcertification visits. Primary stroke center certification was associated with significant changes in care processes associated with PSC certification process, including (1) ED throughput for patients with intracranial hemorrhage (55 minutes faster), (2) increased utilization of cranial magnetic resonance imaging for patients with ischemic stroke (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-2.60), and (3) decrease in time to radiographic imaging for most modalities, including cranial computed tomography done within 6 hours of ED arrival (TIA: 12 minutes faster, ischemic stroke: 11 minutes faster), magnetic resonance imaging for patients with ischemic stroke (197 minutes faster), and carotid Doppler sonography for TIA patients (138 minutes faster). There were no significant changes in survival. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke center certification was associated with significant changes in ED admission and radiographic utilization patterns, without measurable improvements in survival.

Patient awareness and knowledge of breast cancer-related lymphedema in a large, integrated health care delivery system Breast cancer patients have voiced dissatisfaction regarding their education on breast cancer-related lymphedema risk and risk reduction strategies from their clinicians. Informing patients about lymphedema can contribute to decrease their risk of developing the condition, or among those already affected, prevent it from progressing further. In this cross-sectional study, a lymphedema awareness score was calculated based on responses to a brief telephone interview conducted among 389 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 2000 to 2008 and had a previous record of a lymphedema-related diagnosis or procedure in their electronic medical record. During the telephone interview, women self-reported a lymphedema clinical diagnosis, lymphedema symptoms but no lymphedema diagnosis, or neither a diagnosis nor symptoms, and responded to questions on lymphedema education and support services as well as health knowledge. Multivariable logistic regression [odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI)] was used to determine the associations of selected sociodemographic and clinical factors with the odds of having lymphedema awareness (adequate vs. inadequate). The median (range) of the lymphedema awareness score was 4 (0-7). Compared with patients <50 years of age, patients 70+ years of age at breast cancer diagnosis had lower odds of adequate lymphedema awareness (OR 0.25; 95 % CI 0.07, 0.89), while patients 50-59 and 60-69 years had greater odds of adequate awareness although not statistically significant (OR 2.05; 95 % CI 0.88, 4.78 and OR 1.55; 95 % CI 0.60, 4.02, respectively; p for trend = 0.09). Higher educational level and greater health literacy were suggestive of adequate awareness yet were not significant. These results can help inform educational interventions to strengthen patient knowledge of lymphedema risk and risk reduction practices, particularly in an integrated health care delivery setting. With the growing population of breast cancer survivors, increasing patient awareness and education about lymphedema risk reduction and care after cancer diagnosis is warranted.

Evidence from Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) AIMS: To examine the relationship between physical function limitations and diabetes self-management, processes of care and intermediate outcomes in adults >/= 65 years of age with Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We studied 1796 participants 65 years of age and older in managed care health plans enrolled in Translating Research into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD). Physical functioning was assessed at baseline with the Physical Component Summary of the Short Form-12 Health Survey. Diabetes self-management was assessed with follow-up surveys, and processes of care (eye examinations, urine microalbumin testing, foot examinations, etc.) and intermediate health outcomes (HbA(1c), blood pressure, LDL cholesterol) were assessed with medical chart reviews. Multivariate regression models were constructed to examine the associations between physical function limitations and outcomes. RESULTS: Frequency of eye examinations (odds ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.99) was the only process of care that was worse for participants with physical function limitations (n = 573) compared with those without limitations (n = 618). Neither self-management nor intermediate outcomes differed by whether patients had or did not have physical function limitations. CONCLUSION: Limitations in physical functioning as assessed by the Short Form-12 were not associated with substantial difference in diabetes care in adults >/= 65 years of age enrolled in managed care health Sep;29(9):e321-5. The association between sepsis and potential medical injury among hospitalized patients BACKGROUND: Patient safety remains a national priority, but the role of disease-specific characteristics in safety is not well characterized. METHODS: We identified potentially preventable medical injuries using patient safety indicators (PSIs) and annual data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2003 and 2007. We compared the rate of selected PSIs among patients hospitalized with and without sepsis. Among patients with sepsis, we also compared PSI rates across severity strata. Using multivariable case-control matching and regression analyses, we estimated the excess adverse outcomes associated with PSI events in patients with sepsis. RESULTS: Patients hospitalized with sepsis accounted for 2% to 4% of hospital discharges; however, they accounted for 9% to 26% of all potential medical injuries. PSI rates varied considerably; among patients hospitalized for sepsis, they were lowest for accidental puncture or laceration and highest for postoperative respiratory failure. Nearly all PSI rates were higher among patients with sepsis compared with patients without sepsis. Among those with sepsis, most PSI rates increased as sepsis severity increased. Compared with matched sepsis control subjects, increased length of stay and hospital charges were associated with PSI events in sepsis cases. However, only decubitus ulcer, iatrogenic pneumothorax, and postoperative metabolic and physiologic respiratory failure were associated with excess mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients hospitalized for sepsis, compared with the general hospital population, were at a substantially increased risk of potential medical injury; their risk rose as disease severity increased. Future patient safety efforts may benefit from focusing on medically vulnerable populations. Authors: Liu V; Turk Chest. 2012 Sep;142(3):606-13. The Association Between Medication Adherence and Treatment Intensification With Blood Pressure Control in Resistant Hypertension Patients with resistant hypertension are at risk for poor outcomes. Medication adherence and intensification improve blood pressure (BP) control; however, little is known about these processes or their association with outcomes in resistant hypertension. This retrospective study included patients from 2002 to 2006 with incident hypertension from 2 health systems who developed resistant hypertension or uncontrolled BP despite adherence to >/=3 antihypertensive medications. Patterns of hypertension treatment, medication adherence (percentage of days covered), and treatment intensification (increase in medication class or dose) were described in the year after resistant hypertension identification. Then, the association between medication adherence and intensification with 1-year BP control was assessed controlling for patient characteristics. Of the 3550 patients with resistant hypertension, 49% were male, and mean age was 60 years. One year after resistance hypertension determination, fewer patients were taking diuretics (77.7% versus 70.1%; P<0.01) compared with baseline. Rates of BP control improved over 1 year (22% versus 55%; P<0.01). During this year, adherence was not associated with 1-year BP control (adjusted odds ratio, 1.18 [95% CI: 0.94-1.47]). Treatment was intensified in 21.6% of visits with elevated BP. Increasing treatment intensity was associated with 1-year BP control (adjusted odds ratio, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.58-1.71]). In this cohort of patients with resistant hypertension, treatment intensification but not medication adherence was significantly associated with 1-year BP control. These findings highlight the need to investigate why patients with uncontrolled BP do not receive treatment intensification. Authors: Daugherty SL; 2012 Aug;60(2):303-9. Epub 2012 Jun 25. Diabetes differentially affects depression and self-rated health by age in the U.S OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the relationship between age and physical and mental health varies by diabetes status in older U.S. adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, a national sample of 3,005 adults aged 57-85 years, we tested the significance of the interaction between age and diabetes in association with health states. RESULTS: Respondents with diabetes in the youngest age cohort had more medical conditions than those without diabetes, a difference that narrowed with age (P for interaction <0.01). The youngest cohort with diabetes had a higher rate of depression compared to those without diabetes (14 vs. 8%). Depression declined with age and did not differ by diabetes status in the oldest respondents (P = 0.01 for age-diabetes interaction). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes differentially affects self-rated overall health and depression by age, with convergence in the oldest age-group with and without diabetes. Care. 2012 Jul;35(7):1575-7.

The impact of maternal characteristics on the moderately premature infant: an antenatal maternal transport clinical prediction rule OBJECTIVE: Moderately premature infants, defined here as those born between 30(0)/(7) and 34(6)/(7) weeks gestation, comprise 3.9% of all births in the United States and 32% of all preterm births. Although long-term outcomes for these infants are better than for less mature infants, morbidity and mortality are still substantially increased in comparison with infants born at term. There is an added survival benefit resulting from birth at a tertiary neonatal care center, and although many of these infants require tertiary level care, delivery at lower level hospitals and subsequent neonatal transfer are still common. Our primary aim was to determine the impact of maternal characteristics and antenatal medical management on the early neonatal course of the moderately premature infant. The secondary aim was to create a clinical prediction rule to determine which infants require intubation and mechanical ventilation in the first 24 h of life. Such a prediction rule could inform the decision to transfer maternal-fetal patients before delivery to a facility with a Level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where optimal care could be provided without the requirement for a neonatal transfer. STUDY DESIGN: Data for this analysis came from the cohort of infants in the Moderately Premature Infant Project (MPIP) database, a multicenter cohort study of 850 infants born at gestational age 30(0)/(7) and 34(6)/(7) weeks, with birth weight between 1500 and 2499 g, who were discharged to home alive. We built a logistic regression model to identify maternal characteristics associated with need for tertiary care, as measured by administration of surfactant. Using statistically significant covariates from this model, we then created a numerical decision rule to predict need for tertiary care. RESULT: In multivariate modeling, four factors were associated with reduction in the need for tertiary care, including non-White race (odds ratio (OR)=0.5, (0.3, 0.7)), older gestational age, female gender (OR=0.6 (0.4, 0.8)) and use of antenatal corticosteroids (OR=0.5, (0.3, 0.8)). The clinical prediction rule to discriminate between infants who received surfactant, versus those who did not, had an area under the curve of 0.77 (0.73, 0.8). CONCLUSION: Four antenatal risk factors are associated with a requirement for Level III NICU care as defined by the need for surfactant administration. Future analyses will examine a broader spectrum of antenatal characteristics and revalidate the prediction rule in 2012 Jul;32(7):532-8. Epub 2011 Nov 10. Consumer-directed Health Plans With Health Savings Accounts: Whose Skin is in the Game and How do Costs Affect Care Seeking? BACKGROUND: Employers are increasingly offering high-deductible health insurance plans with associated health savings accounts (HSAs), but there is limited information on account contributions or effects on patient care seeking. OBJECTIVE: We examined HSA contributions and their source, patient-reported effects of costs on care seeking, and reports of financial burden. RESEARCH DESIGN: We conducted telephone interviews with 488 adult members of small group of employer-sponsored HSA-eligible plans within an integrated delivery system. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: HSA contribution sources and amounts varied with 32% receiving an employer contribution and also making their own employee contribution, 35% only receiving an employer contribution (no employee contribution), 19% only making their own contribution (no employer contribution), and 14% with no HSA contribution from either source. After adjustment for respondent characteristics, those who made their own HSA contributions in addition to their employer's contribution were significantly more likely to report that costs affected their care-seeking behavior, compared with those with only employer contributions (39% vs. 31% for emergency department and 60% vs. 49% for office visits, all P<0.05). Respondents who contributed to their HSA or who paid out-of-pocket for care were significantly more likely to report financial burdens than those with only employer contributions (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of consumers receive employer contributions to their HSA, but few have fully funded accounts. Those with only an employer contribution reported fewer changes in their care-seeking behavior and were less likely to report experiencing financial burdens.

Minority recruitment into clinical trials: experimental findings and practical implications Racial and ethnic minorities in the US suffer disproportionately from obesity and related comorbidities, yet remain underrepresented in health research. To date, research on practical strategies to improve minority reach and recruitment into clinical trials is primarily descriptive rather than experimental. Within a randomized behavioral weight management trial for obese women, this recruitment experiment examined whether two characteristics of direct mail letters, an ethnically-targeted statement and personalization, increased the response rate among minority women. The ethnically-targeted statement noted ethnic-specific information about health risks of obesity. Personalized letters included recipients' names/addresses in the salutation and a handwritten signature on high-quality letterhead. Of women sent direct mail letters (N=30,000), those sent letters with the ethnically-targeted statement were more likely to respond than women sent letters with the generic statement, 0.8% (n=121) vs. 0.6% (n=90) respectively, p=.03, a 34.4% increase. Women sent personalized letters were no more likely to respond than women sent non-personalized letters, p=.53. In the weight management trial itself, of 267 women randomized into the trial, 33.7% (n=90) were minorities. Of minority women randomized into the trial, 68.9% (n=62) were recruited by direct mail letters: 75.8% (n=47) of those were sent a letter and 24.2% (n=15) were referred by friends/family who were sent a letter. The results indicate that a simple modification to a standard recruitment letter can have a meaningful impact on minority reach and recruitment rates. Practical implications include using ethnically-targeted, non-personalized direct mail letters and recruiting through friends/family at no additional cost. Authors: Jul;33(4):620-3. Epub 2012 Mar 16. Racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of placenta previa OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of placenta previa among different racial and ethnic groups. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine the prevalence of placenta previa among five major racial and ethnic groups: African American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic and Native American. We included all deliveries >/= 20 weeks gestation from a large northern Californian Health Maintenance Organization from 1995-2006. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to control for potential confounders. RESULT: Of the 394 083 deliveries in our cohort, 1580 (0.40%) were complicated by previa. The was: 0.60%, Hispanic 0.34% and unknown 0.31% (P<0.001). In our multivariable logistic regression model, only Asians (odds ratio (OR) 1.73, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.53-1.95) and African Americans (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19-1.72) were at increased risk for having placenta previa, compared with Caucasians.

Interpersonal Processes of Care and Cesarean Delivery in Two Health Care Settings OBJECTIVES: We examined whether interpersonal processes of care (IPC) were associated with cesarean delivery. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 1308 postpartum women at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Walnut Creek, CA (KP-WC), and San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) from 2004 to 2006. Using interview and medical record data, logistic regression analyses estimated the odds of cesarean delivery as a function of IPC domains. RESULTS: After adjustment for demographic and reproductive factors, women at KP-WC who reported higher scores for their provider's 'elicitation of patient concerns and responsiveness' were less likely to have delivered by cesarean, whereas women who reported higher scores for 'empowerment and self-care' were more likely. At KP-WC, women who reported low English proficiency were less likely to have delivered by cesarean than women who reported high proficiency. At SFGH, none of the IPC measures were significant; however, younger age was associated with a lower risk of cesarean delivery, whereas higher educational attainment was associated with an increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce record-high rates of cesarean delivery, more emphasis should be placed on addressing the nonmedical factors associated with operative delivery.

Improving Blood Pressure Control through a Clinical Pharmacist Outreach Program in Diabetes Patients in Two-High Performing Health Systems: The Adherence and Intensification of Medications (AIM) Cluster Randomized Controlled Pragmatic Trial BACKGROUND: Even in high-performing health systems, some patients with diabetes mellitus have poor blood pressure (BP) control because of poor medication adherence and lack of medication intensification. We examined whether the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention, a pharmacist-led intervention combining elements found in efficacy studies to lower BP, improved BP among patients with diabetes mellitus with persistent hypertension and poor refill adherence or insufficient medication intensification in 2 high-performing health systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective, multisite cluster randomized pragmatic trial with randomization of 16 primary care teams at 5 medical centers (3 Veterans Affairs and 2 Kaiser Permanente) to the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention or usual care. The primary outcome was relative change in systolic BP (SBP), comparing 1797 intervention with 2303 control team patients, from 6 months preceding to 6 months after the 14-month intervention period. We examined shorter-term changes in SBP as a secondary outcome. The mean SBP decrease from 6 months before to 6 months after the intervention period was approximately 9 mm Hg in both arms. Mean SBPs of eligible intervention patients were 2.4 mm Hg lower (95% CI: -3.4 to -1.5; P<0.001) immediately after the intervention than those achieved by control patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Adherence and Intensification of Medications program more rapidly lowered SBPs among intervention patients, but usual-care patients achieved equally low SBP levels by 6 months after the intervention period. These findings show the importance of evaluating in different real-life clinical settings programs found in efficacy trials to be effective before urging their widespread adoption in all settings.

Frequency, duration and predictors of bronchiolitis episodes of care among infants [greater than or equal to]32 weeks gestation in a large integrated healthcare system: a retrospective cohort study BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is common in the first two years of life and is the most frequent cause of hospitalization in this age group. No previous studies have used an episode-of-care analysis to describe the frequency, duration, and predictors of bronchiolitis episodes of care during the first two years. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 123,264 infants >/=32 weeks gestation born at 6 Northern California Kaiser Permanente hospitals between 1996 and 2002. We used electronic medical records to concatenate hospital, emergency department and outpatient health care encounters for bronchiolitis into discrete episodes of care. We used descriptive statistics to report frequency and duration of bronchiolitis episodes and used logistic regression to assess the effect of gestational age and other clinical and demographic predictors on the outcome of bronchiolitis episodes. RESULTS: Among all infants, the rate of bronchiolitis episodes was 162 per 1000 children during the first 2 years of life; approximately 40% required >1 day of medical attention with a mean duration of 7.0 +/- 5.9 days. Prematurity was associated with increased risk of bronchiolitis episodes and longer duration. Bronchiolitis episodes rates per 1000 infants were 246 for 32-33 weeks gestational age, 204 for 34-36 weeks, and 148-178 for >36 weeks. Male gender, African-American and Hispanic race/ethnicity, and parental history of asthma were associated with an increased risk of having a bronchiolitis episode and/or longer duration. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchiolitis episodes of care are frequent during the first two years of life and the duration ranges from 1 to 27 days. Prematurity was associated with more frequent and longer duration of bronchiolitis episodes of care, which may reflect illness severity and/or perceived vulnerability. Authors: Jun 8;12:144. Predictors of Mortality Over 8 Years in Type 2 Diabetic Patients: Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) OBJECTIVE: To examine demographic, socioeconomic, and biological risk factors for all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes over 8 years and to construct mortality prediction equations. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Beginning in 2000, survey and medical record information was obtained from 8,334 participants in Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD), a multicenter prospective observational study of diabetes care in managed care. The National Death Index was searched annually to obtain data on deaths over an 8-year follow-up period (2000-2007). Predictors examined included age, sex, race, education, income, smoking, age at diagnosis of diabetes, duration and treatment of diabetes, BMI, complications, comorbidities, and medication use. RESULTS: There were 1,616 (19%) deaths over the 8-year period. In the most parsimonious equation, the predictors of all-cause mortality included older age, male sex, white race, lower income, smoking, insulin treatment, nephropathy, history of dyslipidemia, higher LDL cholesterol, angina/myocardial infarction/other coronary disease/coronary angioplasty/bypass, congestive heart failure, aspirin, beta-blocker, and diuretic use, and higher Charlson Index. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of death can be predicted in people with type 2 diabetes using simple demographic, socioeconomic, and biological risk factors with fair reliability. Such prediction equations are essential for computer simulation models of diabetes progression and may, with further validation, be useful for 2012 Mar 19. Immediate and delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage in patients with head trauma and preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel use STUDY OBJECTIVE: Patients receiving warfarin or clopidogrel are considered at increased risk for traumatic intracranial hemorrhage after blunt head trauma. The prevalence of immediate traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and the cumulative incidence of delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage in these patients, however, are unknown. The objective of this study is to address these gaps in knowledge. METHODS: A prospective, observational study at 2 trauma centers and 4 community hospitals enrolled emergency department (ED) patients with blunt head trauma and preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel use from April 2009 through January 2011. Patients were followed for 2 weeks. The prevalence of immediate traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and the cumulative incidence of delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage were calculated from patients who received initial cranial computed tomography (CT) in the ED. Delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as traumatic intracranial hemorrhage within 2 weeks after an initially normal CT scan result and in the absence of repeated head trauma. RESULTS: A total of 1,064 patients were enrolled (768 warfarin [72.2%] patients [27.8%]). There were 364 patients (34.2%) from Level I or II trauma centers and 700 patients (65.8%) from community hospitals. One thousand patients received a cranial CT scan in the ED. Both warfarin and clopidogrel groups had similar demographic and clinical characteristics, although concomitant aspirin use was more prevalent among patients receiving clopidogrel. The prevalence of immediate traumatic intracranial hemorrhage was higher in patients receiving 1.48 to 3.63). Delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage was identified in 4 of 687 (0.6%; 95% CI 0.2% to 1.5%) patients receiving warfarin of 243 95% CI 0% to 1.5%) patients receiving clopidogrel. CONCLUSION: Although there may be unmeasured confounders that limit intergroup comparison, patients receiving clopidogrel have a significantly higher prevalence of immediate traumatic intracranial hemorrhage compared with patients receiving warfarin. Delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage is rare and occurred only in patients receiving warfarin. Discharging patients receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications from the ED after a normal cranial CT scan result is reasonable, but appropriate instructions are required because delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage may Holmes JF; Clinical Research in Emergency Services and Treatment (CREST) Network Ann Emerg Med. 2012 Jun;59(6):460-8.e1-7.

Gastrointestinal Disease Outbreak Detection Using Multiple Data Streams from Electronic Medical Records BACKGROUND: Passive reporting and laboratory testing delays may limit gastrointestinal (GI) disease outbreak detection. Healthcare systems routinely collect clinical data in electronic medical records (EMRs) that could be used for surveillance. This study's primary objective was to identify data streams from EMRs that may perform well for GI outbreak detection. METHODS: Zip code-specific daily episode counts in 2009 were generated for 22 syndromic and laboratory-based data streams from Kaiser Permanente Northern California EMRs, covering 3.3 million members. Data streams included outpatient and inpatient diagnosis codes, antidiarrheal medication dispensings, stool culture orders, and positive microbiology tests for six GI pathogens. Prospective daily surveillance was mimicked using the space-time permutation scan statistic in single and multi-stream analyses, and space-time clusters were identified. Serotype relatedness was assessed for isolates in two Salmonella clusters. RESULTS: Potential outbreaks included a cluster of 18 stool cultures ordered over 5 days in one zip code and a Salmonella cluster in three zip codes over 9 days, in which at least five of six cases had the same rare serotype. In all, 28 potential outbreaks were identified using single stream analyses, with signals in outpatient diagnosis codes most common. Multi-stream analyses identified additional potential outbreaks and in one example, improved the timeliness of detection. CONCLUSIONS: GI disease-related data streams can be used to identify potential outbreaks when generated from EMRs with extensive regional coverage. This process can supplement traditional GI outbreak reports to health departments, which frequently consist of outbreaks in well-defined settings (e.g., day care centers and restaurants) with no laboratory-confirmed pathogen. Data streams most promising for surveillance included microbiology test results, stool culture orders, and outpatient diagnoses. In particular, clusters of microbiology tests positive for specific pathogens could be identified in EMRs and used to prioritize further testing at state health departments, potentially improving outbreak detection.

Comparative safety of infliximab and etanercept on the risk of serious infections: does the association vary by patient characteristics? PURPOSE: Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal anti-TNFalpha antibody, has been found to increase the risk of serious infections compared with the TNF receptor fusion protein etanercept in some studies. It is unclear whether the risk varies by patient characteristics. We conducted a study to address this question. METHODS: We identified members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who initiated infliximab (n = 793) or etanercept (n = 2692) in 1997-2007. Using a Cox model, we estimated the propensity-score-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of serious infections requiring hospitalization or opportunistic infections comparing infliximab initiators to etanercept initiators. We tested whether the adjusted HR differed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and smoking status. RESULTS: The crude incidence rate of serious infections per 100 person-years was 5.4 (95%CI: 3.8, 7.5) in patients <65 years and 16.0 (95%CI: 10.4, 23.4) in patients >/=65 years during the first 3 months following treatment initiation. Compared with etanercept, the adjusted HR during this period was elevated for infliximab in patients <65 years (HR: 3.01; 95%CI: 1.49, 6.07), >/=65 years (HR 0.94; 95%CI: 0.41, 2.13). Findings did not suggest that the HR varied by the other patient characteristics examined. CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk of serious infections associated with infliximab relative to etanercept did not appear to be modified by patients' sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, or smoking status. There was an indication that the increased risk might be limited to patients <65 years. Additional studies are warranted to verify or refute this finding. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The value of additional pathology comments indicating suspicion of adenocarcinoma among women diagnosed preoperatively with complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia Over 40% of women with a preoperative diagnosis of complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) will have endometrial cancer at hysterectomy. CAH diagnoses are often qualified by comments indicating suspicion of cancer. We examine whether these comments correlate with cancer found at hysterectomy. Pathology reports for 824 women with CAH diagnoses who underwent hysterectomy were reviewed to identify those qualified by comments indicating concern for cancer. The rate of cancer, severity of disease, and effects of endometrial sampling method and age were determined. Comments indicating suspicion of cancer qualified 219 of 824 (27%) CAH diagnoses and were associated with a significantly higher cancer rate at hysterectomy (69% versus 40%; P<0.0001), regardless of whether sampling consisted of curettage or biopsy. Cancer severity correlated independently with age. Comments indicating concern for underlying cancer frequently qualify CAH diagnoses and are associated with a high likelihood of cancer and with more extensive disease, especially for older women.

Total Serum Bilirubin Exceeding Exchange Transfusion Thresholds in the Setting of Universal Screening OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence and predictors of total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels that meet or exceed American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) exchange transfusion (ET) thresholds in the setting of universal screening. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of electronic data on 18 089 newborns >/=35 weeks gestation born at Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program hospitals implementing universal TSB screening in 2005 to 2007, with chart review for subjects with TSB levels reaching the AAP threshold for ET. RESULTS: The outcome developed in 22 infants (0.12%); 14 (63.6%) were <38 weeks gestation. Only one infant received an ET; none of the infants had documented sequelae. The first TSB was at least high-intermediate risk on the AAP risk-nomogram for all 22 infants and high-risk for those >/=38 weeks, but was less than the phototherapy level in 15 infants (68%). Of these 15 infants, 2 failed phototherapy and 13 did not have a TSB repeated in <24 hours. However, re-testing all infants at high-intermediate risk or greater would have required 2166 additional bilirubin tests. CONCLUSION: Screening was sensitive but not specific for predicting exchange threshold. Authors: Flaherman VJ; Epub 2011 Dec 1.

A comparison between antihypertensive medication adherence and treatment intensification as potential clinical performance measures BACKGROUND: Medication adherence and treatment intensification have been advocated as performance measures to assess the quality of care provided. Whereas previous studies have shown that adherence and treatment intensification (TI) of antihypertensive medications is associated with blood pressure (BP) control at the patient level, less is known about whether adherence and TI is associated with BP control at the clinic level. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 162 879 patients among 89 clinics in the Cardiovascular Research Network Hypertension Registry with incident hypertension who were started on antihypertensive medications. Adherence was measured by the proportion of days covered (PDC). TI was defined by the standard based method with scores ranging between -1 to 1 and categorized as: -1 indicated no TI occurred when BP was elevated; 0 indicated TI occurred when BP was elevated; and 1 indicated that TI was made at all visits, even when BP was not elevated. Logistic regression models assessed the association between adherence and TI with blood pressure control (BP = 140/90 at the clinic visit closest to 12 months after study entry) at the patient and clinic levels. Mean adherence was 0.77 +/- 0.28 (PDC +/- SD) at the patient level and 0.78 +/- 0.05 at the clinic level. Mean TI was 0.026 +/- 0.23 at the patient level and 0.01 +/- 0.04 at the clinic level. At the patient level, for each 0.25 increase in adherence and TI, the odds (OR) of achieving blood pressure control increased by 28% and 55%, respectively [OR for adherence, 1.28 (1.26-1.29), and for TI, 1.55 (1.53-1.57)]. At the clinic level, each 0.04 increment increase in treatment intensification was associated with a 25% increased odds of achieving blood pressure control (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.21-1.27). In contrast, there was an inverse association between increasing adherence and BP control (OR, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Patient adherence to antihypertensive medications is not associated with BP control at the clinic level and may not be suitable as a performance measure. TI is associated with BP control, but its use as a performance measure may be constrained by challenges in measuring it and by concerns about unintended consequences of aggressive hypertension treatment in some subgroups of patients.

Early detection of impending physiologic deterioration among patients who are not in intensive care: Development of predictive models using data from an automated electronic medical record BACKGROUND: Ward patients who experience unplanned transfer to intensive care units have excess morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To develop a predictive model for prediction of unplanned transfer from the medical-surgical ward to intensive care (or death on the ward in a patient who was 'full code') using data from a comprehensive inpatient electronic medical record (EMR). DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study; unit of analysis was a 12-hour patient shift. Shifts where a patient experienced an unplanned transfer were event shifts; shifts without a transfer were comparison shifts. Hospitalization records were transformed into 12-hour shift records, with 10 randomly selected comparison shifts identified for each event shift. Analysis employed logistic regression and split validation. SETTING: Integrated healthcare delivery system in Northern California. PATIENTS: Hospitalized adults at 14 hospitals with comprehensive inpatient EMRs. MEASUREMENTS: Predictors included vital signs, laboratory test results, severity of illness scores, longitudinal chronic illness burden scores, transpired hospital length of stay, and care directives. Patients were also given a retrospective, electronically (not manually assigned) Modified Early Warning Score, or MEWS(re). Outcomes were transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the ward or transitional care unit, or death outside the ICU among patients who were 'full code'. RESULTS: We identified 4,036 events and 39,782 comparison shifts from a cohort of 102,422 patients' hospitalizations. The MEWS(re) had a c-statistic of 0.709 in the derivation and 0.698 in the validation dataset; corresponding values for the EMR-based model were 0.845 and 0.775. LIMITATIONS: Using these algorithms requires hospitals with comprehensive inpatient EMRs and longitudinal data. CONCLUSIONS: EMR-based detection of impending deterioration outside the ICU is feasible in integrated healthcare delivery systems. Authors: Escobar GJ; LaGuardia JC; Med. 2012 May-Jun;7(5):388-95.

Large clinical trials and lengthy observational cohort studies have clearly established the importance of glycemic, blood pressure and lipid level control. Indeed, most elements of guideline-based diabetes care can be supported by clinical research evidence. While such studies are critical for establishing treatment recommendations, the evidence derived from clinical trial participants applies to populations of patients rather than to the individual sitting before the clinician. An important next step in diabetes care would be to develop and implement a framework for personalizing care. In this article, we highlight the major reasons for personalization and discuss what the future of personalized diabetes care may hold. Authors: Grant RW; Wexler DJ A Randomized Controlled Trial CONTEXT: Patients with depression and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease (CHD), or both have higher medical complication rates and higher health care costs, suggesting that more effective care management of psychiatric and medical disease control might also reduce medical service use and enhance quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a multicondition collaborative treatment program (TEAMcare) compared with usual primary care (UC) in outpatients with depression and poorly controlled diabetes or CHD. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of a systematic care management program aimed at improving depression scores and hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. SETTING: Fourteen primary care clinics of an integrated health care system. Patients Population-based screening identified 214 adults with depressive disorder and poorly controlled diabetes or CHD. Intervention Physician-supervised nurses collaborated with primary care physicians to provide treatment of multiple disease risk factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blinded assessments evaluated depressive symptoms, SBP, and HbA(1c) at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Fasting LDL-C concentration was assessed at baseline and at 12 and 24 months. Health plan accounting records were used to assess medical service costs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assessed using a previously developed regression model based on intervention vs UC differences in HbA(1c), LDL-C, and SBP levels over 24 months. RESULTS: Over 24 months, compared with UC controls, intervention patients had a mean of 114 (95% CI, 79 to 149) additional depression-free days and an estimated 0.335 (95% CI, -0.18 to 0.85) additional QALYs. Intervention patients also had lower mean outpatient health costs of $594 per patient (95% CI, -$3241 to $2053) relative to UC patients. CONCLUSIONS: For adults with depression and poorly controlled diabetes, CHD, or both, a systematic intervention program aimed at improving depression scores and HbA(1c), SBP, and LDL-C levels seemed to be a high-value program that for no or modest additional cost markedly improved QALYs.

Ethnic Differences in Appointment-Keeping and Implications for the Patient-Centered Medical Home-Findings from the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) OBJECTIVE: To examine ethnic differences in appointment-keeping in a managed care setting. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE), 2005-2007, n = 12,957. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. Poor appointment-keeping (PAK) was defined as missing >1/3 of planned, primary care appointments. Poisson regression models were used to estimate ethnic-specific relative risks of PAK (adjusting for demographic, socio-economic, health status, and facility effects). DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Administrative/electronic health records and survey responses. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Poor appointment-keeping rates differed >2-fold across ethnicities: Latinos (12 percent), African Americans (10 percent), Filipinos (7 percent), Caucasians (6 percent), and Asians (5 percent), but also varied by medical center. Receiving >50 percent of outpatient care via same-day appointments was associated with a 4-fold greater PAK rate. PAK was associated with 20, 30, and 40 percent increased risk of elevated HbA1c (>7 percent), CONCLUSIONS: Latinos and African Americans were at highest risk of missing planned primary care appointments. PAK was associated with a greater reliance on same-day visits and substantively poorer clinical outcomes. These results have important implications for public health and health plan policy, as primary care rapidly expands toward open access to care supported by the patient-centered medical home model.

Place matters: Neighborhood deprivation and cardiometabolic risk factors in the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) While neighborhood deprivation is associated with prevalence of chronic diseases, it is not well understood whether neighborhood deprivation is also associated with cardiometabolic risk factors among adults with chronic disease. Subjects (n = 19,804) from the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) cohort study, an ethnically-stratified, random sample of members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated managed care consortium, with type 2 diabetes who completed a survey between 2005 and 2007 and who lived in a 19 county study area were included in the analyses. We estimated the association between a validated neighborhood deprivation index (NDI) and four cardiometabolic risk factors: body mass index (BMI = kg/m(2)), glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c), low density lipoproteins (LDL) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) using multi-level models. Outcomes were modeled in their continuous form and as binary indicators of poor control (severe obesity: NDI (p < 0.001 in each case); however, LDL was significantly associated with NDI only when comparing the most to the least deprived quartile. NDI remained significantly associated with BMI and A1c after adjusting for individual level factors including income and education. A linear trend (p < 0.001) was observed in the relative risk ratios for dichotomous indicators of severe obesity, poor glycemic control, and 2 or more poorly controlled cardiometabolic risk factors across NDI quartile. In adjusted models, higher levels of neighborhood deprivation were positively associated with indicators of cardiometabolic risk among adults with diabetes, suggesting that neighborhood level deprivation may influence individual outcomes. However, longitudinal data are needed to test the causal direction of these Med. 2012 Apr;74(7):1082-90. Epub 2012 Jan 28. Association of Depression With Increased Risk of Dementia in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: The Diabetes and Aging Study CONTEXT: Although depression is a risk factor for dementia in the general population, its association with dementia among patients with diabetes mellitus has not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether comorbid depression in patients with type 2 diabetes increases the risk of development of dementia. DESIGN: The Diabetes and Aging Study was a cohort investigation that surveyed a racially/ethnically stratified random sample of patients with type 2 diabetes. SETTING: A large, integrated, nonprofit managed care setting in Northern California. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 19 239 diabetes registry members 30 to 75 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Patient Health Questionnaire 8, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnoses of depression, and/or antidepressant prescriptions in the 12 months prior to baseline were used to identify prevalent cases of depression. Clinically recognized dementia was identified among subjects with no prior ICD-9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnoses of dementia. To exclude the possibility that depression was a prodrome of dementia, dementia diagnoses were only based on ICD-9-CM diagnoses identified in years 3 to 5 postbaseline. The risk of dementia for patients with depression and diabetes relative to patients with diabetes alone was estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models that adjusted for sociodemographic, clinical, and health risk factors and health use. RESULTS: During the 3- to 5-year period, 80 of 3766 patients (2.1%) with comorbid depression and diabetes (incidence rate of 5.5 per 1000 person-years) vs 158 of 15 473 patients (1.0%) with diabetes alone (incidence rate of 2.6 per 1000 person-years) had 1 or more ICD-9-CM diagnoses of dementia. Patients with comorbid depression had a 100% increased risk of dementia during the 3 to 5 years postbaseline (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.73-2.35). CONCLUSION: Depression in patients with diabetes was associated with a substantively increased risk for development of dementia compared with those with diabetes alone.

Clinician awareness and knowledge of breast cancer-related lymphedema in a large, integrated health care delivery setting Breast cancer survivors have reported dissatisfaction regarding their education on risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) from clinicians. We describe clinician knowledge and treatment referral of patients with BCRL among active oncologists, surgeons, and primary care physicians in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Medical Care Program. A total of 887 oncologists, surgeons, and primary care clinicians completed a 10-minute web survey from May 2, 2010 to December 31, 2010 on BCRL knowledge, education, and referral patterns. A knowledge score of BCRL was calculated based on clinician responses. Multivariable regression models were used to determine the associations of selected covariates with BCRL knowledge score and clinician referral, respectively. Compared with primary care clinicians, oncologists had the highest mean score followed closely by surgeons (P < 0.0001). In multivariable analyses, being female, an oncologist or surgeon, and recently receiving BCRL materials were each significantly associated with higher BCRL knowledge scores. About 44% of clinicians (n = 381) indicated they had ever made a BCRL referral (100% oncologists, 79% surgeons, and 36% primary care clinicians). Clinicians with a higher knowledge score were more likely to make referrals. In stratified analyses by specialty, the significant associated factors remained for primary care but became non-significant for oncology and surgery. These results can inform educational interventions to strengthen clinician knowledge of the clinical management of BCRL, especially among primary care clinicians. With the growing number of breast cancer survivors, increasing clinician education about BCRL across all specialties is Cancer Res Treat. 2012 Feb;131(3):1029-38. Epub 2011 Oct 29. Potential for overuse of corticosteroids and vasopressin in septic shock Authors: the gap: eliminating health care disparities among Latinos with diabetes using health information technology tools and patient navigators Latinos have higher rates of diabetes and diabetes-related complications compared to non-Latinos. Clinical diabetes self-management tools that rely on innovative health information technology (HIT) may not be widely used by Latinos, particularly those that have low literacy or numeracy, low income, and/or limited English proficiency. Prior work has shown that tailored diabetes self-management educational interventions are feasible and effective in improving diabetes knowledge and physiological measures among Latinos, especially those interventions that utilize tailored coaching and navigator programs. In this article, we discuss the role of HIT for diabetes management in Latinos and describe a novel 'eNavigator' role that we are developing to increase HIT adoption and thereby reduce health care disparities.

The incidence of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in a large managed care organization, with reference to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, Northern California, 2000-2006 BACKGROUND: Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, has been reported following TNF-alpha-blocker therapy. To better understand this relationship, we conducted an epidemiologic study in the Kaiser Permanente membership. METHODS: The retrospective cohort study was conducted among Northern California members of all ages. The Kaiser Permanente Cancer Registry, supplemented with review of medical charts and pathology slides, was used to identify and confirm cases of HSTCL. Medical histories were obtained, and we computed the standardized incidence rate for the 7-year period 2000-2006, when immunohistochemical staining was fully established throughout the health plan for diagnosing lymphoma. RESULTS: Six cases were diagnosed during 2000-2006, for an annual age-standardized incidence rate of 0.3 (95%CI, 0.11-0.65) per million person-years. One case had a prior diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS); another had a prior diagnosis of Crohn's disease treated with steroids, thiopurine and infliximab. CONCLUSION: Prior cases of HIV/AIDS-linked HSTCL are uncommon in the existing literature. Multiple case reports of HSTCL in the setting of Crohn's disease treated with anti-TNF plus thiopurine have been published, but HSTCL is rare, making epidemiologic assessments difficult.

Getting Under the Skin of Clinical Inertia in Insulin Initiation: The Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) Insulin Starts Project PURPOSE: The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to explore primary care providers' (PCPs) perceptions about barriers to initiating insulin among patients. Studies suggest that many patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes do not receive insulin initiation by PCPs.METHODS: As part of the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes study, the authors conducted structured interviews in health systems in Indiana, New Jersey, and California, asking PCPs about the importance of insulin initiation and factors affecting this decision. The authors calculated proportions choosing each multiple-choice response option and listed the most frequently offered open-ended response categories.RESULTS: Among 83 PCPs, 45% were women; 60% were white; and they averaged years in practice. Four-fifths of PCPs endorsed guideline-concordant glycemic targets, but 54% individualized targets based on patient age, life expectancy, medical comorbidities, self-management capacity, and willingness. Most (64%) reported that many patients were resistant to new oral or insulin therapies due to fears about the therapy and what it meant about their disease progression. Two-thirds (64%) cited patient resistance as a barrier to insulin initiation, and 43% cited problems with patient self-management, including cognitive or mental health issues, dexterity, or ability to adhere. Eighty percent felt that patient nonadherence would dissuade them from initiating insulin at least some of the time.CONCLUSIONS: PCPs perceived that patient resistance and poor self-management skills were significant barriers to initiating insulin. Future studies should investigate whether systems-level interventions to improve patient-provider communication about insulin and enhance providers' perceptions of patient self-management capacity can 2012 Jan 5.

Evaluation of risk equations for prediction of short-term coronary heart disease events in patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes: the translating research into action for diabetes (triad) study ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: To evaluate the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and Framingham risk equations for predicting short-term risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events among adults with long-standing type 2 diabetes, including those with and without preexisting CHD. METHODS: Prospective cohort of U.S. managed care enrollees aged >= 18 years and mean diabetes duration of more than 10 years, participating in the Translating Research into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) study, was followed for the first occurrence of CHD events from 2000 to 2003. The UKPDS and Framingham risk equations were evaluated for discriminating power and calibration. RESULTS: A total of 8303 TRIAD participants, were identified to evaluate the UKPDS (n=5914, 120 events), Framingham-initial (n=5914, 218 events) and Framingham-secondary (n=2389, 374 events) risk equations, according to their prior CHD history. All of these equations exhibited low discriminating power with Harrell's c-index <0.65. All except the Framingham-initial equation for women and the Framingham-secondary equation for men had low levels of calibration. After adjsusting for the average values of predictors and event rates in the TRIAD population, the calibration of these equations greatly improved. CONCLUSIONS: The UKPDS and Framingham risk equations may be inappropriate for predicting the short-term risk of CHD events in patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes, partly due to changes in medications used by patients with diabetes and other improvements in clinical care since the Frmaingham and UKPDS studies were conducted. Refinement of these equations to reflect contemporary CHD profiles, diagnostics and therapies are needed to provide reliable risk estimates to inform effective treatment. Authors: Lu 9;12:12. Improving treatment intensification to reduce cardiovascular disease risk: a cluster randomized trial BACKGROUND: Blood pressure, lipid, and glycemic control are essential for reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Many health care systems have successfully shifted aspects of chronic disease management, including population-based outreach programs designed to address CVD risk factor control, to non-physicians. The purpose of this study is to evaluate provision of new information to non-physician outreach teams on need for treatment intensification in patients with increased CVD risk. METHODS: Cluster randomized trial (July 1-December 31, 2008) in Kaiser Permanente Northern California registry of members with diabetes mellitus, prior CVD diagnoses and/or chronic kidney disease who were high-priority for treatment intensification: blood pressure >/= to current medications; no recent treatment intensification). Randomization units were medical center-based outreach teams (4 intervention; 4 control). For intervention teams, priority flags for intensification were added monthly to the registry database with recommended next pharmacotherapeutic steps for each eligible patient. Control teams used the same database without this information. Outcomes included 3-month rates of treatment intensification and risk factor levels during follow-up. RESULTS: Baseline risk factor control rates were high (82-90%). In eligible patients, the intervention was associated with significantly greater 3-month intensification rates for blood pressure (34.1 vs. 30.6%) and LDL-cholesterol (28.0 vs 22.7%), but not A1c. No effects on risk factors were observed at 3 months or 12 months follow-up. Intervention teams initiated outreach for only 45-47% of high-priority patients, but also for 27-30% of lower-priority patients. Teams reported difficulties adapting prior outreach strategies to incorporate the new information. CONCLUSIONS: Information enhancement did not improve risk factor control compared to existing outreach strategies at control centers. Familiarity with prior, relatively successful strategies likely reduced uptake of the innovation and its potential for success at intervention centers. BMC Serv Res. 2012 Jul 2;12:183. Implementation of a web-based tool for patient medication self-management: the Medication Self-titration Evaluation Programme (Med-STEP) for blood pressure control BACKGROUND: Informatics tools may help support hypertension management. OBJECTIVE: To design, implement and evaluate a web-based system for patient anti-hypertensive medication self-titration. METHODS: Study stages included: six focus groups (50 patients) to identify barriers/facilitators to patient medication self-titration, software design informed by qualitative analysis of focus group responses and a six-month single-arm pilot study (20 patients) to assess implementation feasibility. RESULTS: Focus groups emphasised patient need to feel confident that their own primary care providers were directly involved and approved of the titration protocol. Physicians required 3.3 +/- 2.8 minutes/patient to create individualised six-step medication pathways for once-monthly blood pressure evaluations. Pilot participants (mean age of 51.5 +/- 11 years, 45% women, mean baseline blood pressure 139/84 +/- 12.2/7.5 mmHg) had five medication increases, two non-adherence self-reports, 52 months not requiring medication changes, 24 skipped months and 17 months with no evaluations due to technical issues. Four pilot patients dropped out before study completion. From baseline to study completion, blood pressure decreased among the 16 patients remaining in the study (8.0/4.7 mmHg, p = 0.03 for both systolic and diastolic pressures). CONCLUSIONS: Lessons learned included the benefit of qualitative patient analysis prior to system development and the feasibility of physicians designing individual treatment pathways. Any potential clinical benefits were offset by technical problems, the tendency for patients to skip their monthly self-evaluations and drop outs. To be more widely adopted such systems must effectively generalise to a wider range of patients and be integrated into clinical Prim Care. 2012;20(1):57-67. Defining patient complexity from the primary care physician's perspective: a cohort study. BACKGROUND: Patients with complex health needs are increasingly the focus of health system redesign.OBJECTIVE: To characterize complex patients, as defined by their primary care physicians (PCPs), and to compare this definition with other commonly used algorithms.DESIGN: Cohort study.SETTING: 1 hospital-based practice, 4 community health centers, and 7 private practices in a primary care network in the United States.PARTICIPANTS: 40 physicians who reviewed a random sample of 120 of their own patients.MEASUREMENTS: After excluding patients for whom they were not directly responsible, PCPs indicated which of their patients they considered complex. These patients were characterized, independent predictors of complexity were identified, and PCP-defined complexity was compared with 3 comorbidity-based methods (Charlson score, Higashi score, and a proprietary Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services algorithm).RESULTS: Physicians identified 1126 of their 4302 eligible patients (26.2%) as complex and assigned a mean of 2.2 domains of complexity per patient (median, 2.0 [interquartile range, 1 to 3]). Mental health and substance use were identified as major issues in younger complex patients, whereas medical decision making and care coordination predominated in older patients (P<0.001 for trends by decade). Major independent predictors of PCP-defined complexity (P<0.001) included age (probability of complexity increased from 14.8% to 19.8% with age increasing from 55 to 65 years), poorly controlled diabetes (from 12.7% to 47.6% if hemoglobin A1c level9%), use 31.8%), alcohol-related (from 12.9% to 27.4%), and inadequate insurance (from 12.5% to 19.2%). Classification agreement for complex patients ranged from 26.2% to 56.0% when PCP assignment was compared with each of the other methods.LIMITATION: Results may not be generalizable to other primary care settings.CONCLUSION: Primary care physicians identified approximately one quarter of their patients as complex. Medical, social, and behavioral factors all contributed to PCP-defined complexity. Physician-defined complexity had only modest agreement with 3 comorbidity-based algorithms.

Initiation of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha Antagonists and the Risk of Hospitalization for Infection in Patients With Autoimmune Diseases CONTEXT: Although tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists are increasingly used in place of nonbiologic comparator medications, their safety profile remains incomplete. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether initiation of TNF-alpha antagonists compared with nonbiologic comparators is associated with an increased risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Within a US multi-institutional collaboration, we assembled retrospective cohorts (1998-2007) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis (psoriasis and spondyloarthropathies) combining data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, New Jersey and Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical Assistance programs, Tennessee Medicaid, and national Medicaid/Medicare. TNF-alpha antagonists and nonbiologic regimens were compared in disease-specific propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts using Cox regression models with nonbiologics as the reference. Baseline glucocorticoid use was evaluated as a separate covariate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Infections requiring hospitalization (serious infections) during the first 12 months after initiation of TNF-alpha antagonists or nonbiologic regimens. RESULTS: psoriasis and spondyloarthropathies matched pairs using TNF-alpha antagonists and comparator medications. Overall, we identified 1172 serious infections, most of which (53%) were pneumonia and skin and soft tissue infections. Among patients with RA, serious infection hospitalization rates were 8.16 (TNF-alpha antagonists) and 7.78 (comparator regimens) per 100 person-years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.05 [95% CI, 0.91-1.21]). Among patients with IBD, rates were 10.91 (TNF-alpha antagonists) and 9.60 (comparator) per 100 person-years (aHR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.83-1.46]). Among patients with psoriasis and spondyloarthropathies, rates were 5.41 (TNF-alpha antagonists) and 5.37 (comparator) per 100 person-years (aHR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.76-1.45]). Among patients with RA, infliximab was associated with a significant increase in serious infections compared with etanercept (aHR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.07-1.47]) and adalimumab (aHR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.02-1.48]). Baseline glucocorticoid use was associated with a dose-dependent increase in infections. CONCLUSION: Among patients with autoimmune diseases, compared with treatment with nonbiologic regimens, initiation of TNF-alpha antagonists was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalizations for serious infections.

Provider factors and patient-reported healthcare discrimination in the Diabetes Study of California (DISTANCE) OBJECTIVE: We examined provider-level factors and reported discrimination in the healthcare setting. METHODS: With data from the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) - a race-stratified survey of diabetes patients in Kaiser Permanente Northern California - we analyzed patient-reported racial/ethnic discrimination from providers. Primary exposures were characteristics of the primary care provider (PCP, who coordinates care in this system), including specialty/type, and patient-provider relationship variables, including racial concordance. RESULTS: included black, 20% Latino, 30% white, and 6% other patients, with 2-8% reporting discrimination by racial/ethnic group. Patients seeing nurse practitioners as their PCP (OR=0.09; 95% CI: 0.01-0.67) and those on communication (OR=0.70; 95% CI: 0.66-0.74) were less likely to report discrimination, while those with more visits (OR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.03-1.18) were more likely to report discrimination. Racial concordance was not significant once adjusting for patient race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Among diverse diabetes patients in managed care, provider type and communication were significantly related to patient-reported discrimination. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Given potential negative impacts on patient satisfaction and treatment decisions, future studies should investigate which interpersonal aspects of the provider-patient relationship reduce patient perceptions of unfair 2011 May 24. Role of Thiopurine and Anti-TNF Therapy in Lymphoma in Inflammatory Bowel Disease OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) medications in relation to lymphoma risk. METHODS: Information on IBD and relevant medications and other utilization was obtained from the Kaiser Permanente IBD Registry, 1996-2009. Lymphoma cases were ascertained from the Kaiser Permanente Cancer Registry. Lymphoma incidence was compared between the IBD cohort and the general Kaiser Permanente population. RESULTS: Of the 16,023 IBD patients without human immunodeficiency virus followed an average 5.8 years, 43 developed lymphoma. IBD patients with and without lymphoma did not differ with respect to past IBD-related visits, procedures, or tests. The standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR) for lymphoma among IBD patients with no dispensing of thiopurine or anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was 1.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.96-1.1). Of anti-TNF dispensings, the SIRR was 0.3 (95% CI: 0.2-0.4) for use and 1.4 for current use (95% CI: 1.2-2.7). Among patients with dispensing of anti-TNF (with and without thiopurine), the SIRR was 5.5 for past use (95% CI: 4.5-6.6) and 4.4 for current use (95% CI: study provides evidence that IBD alone is not associated with the risk of lymphoma. Use of anti-TNF with thiopurine and current use of thiopurine alone were associated with increased risk, although the effect of disease severity merits further evaluation.

The Comparative Effectiveness of Mail Order Pharmacy Use vs. Local Pharmacy Use on LDL-C Control in New Statin Users BACKGROUND: Mail order pharmacies are commonly used to deliver CVD risk factor medications. Previous studies have shown that mail order pharmacy use is associated with greater medication adherence; however, no studies have examined whether mail order pharmacy use is related to improved CVD risk factor outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the comparative effectiveness of mail order pharmacy vs. local pharmacy use on LDL-C control in new statin users. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. PATIENTS: 100,298 adult Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) members who were new users of statins between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2007. MEASUREMENTS: The main outcome measure was LDL-C control in the 3-15 month period after statin therapy was initiated. RESULTS: After adjustment for patient, clinical, and census-block characteristics, and for potential unmeasured differences between mail order and local KPNC pharmacy users with instrumental variables analysis, 85.0% of patients who used the mail order pharmacy to deliver their statin at any time achieved target LDL-C levels compared with 74.2% of patients who only used the local KPNC pharmacy to dispense the statin (p < 0.001). Greater adjusted rates of LDL-C control in mail order pharmacy users were seen across all gender and race/ethnicity subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Mail order pharmacy use was positively associated with LDL-C control in new statin users. Future research should continue to explore the relationship between mail order pharmacy use and outcomes, and address how to appropriately target mail order services to patients most likely to benefit without compromising patient choice, care, and safety.

Ethnic differences in the development of albuminuria: the DISTANCE study Objectives: To determine whether ethnic differences in the incidence of albuminuria are present in patients with diabetes, and to identify social, behavioral, and provider factors that explain ethnic differences. Study Design: Survey follow-up design with a race-stratified baseline survey (2005-2006) in diabetic patients from a nonprofit, fully integrated healthcare system in Northern California. We followed the 10,596 respondents (30% whites, 20% blacks, 23% Hispanics, 14% Asians, and 13% Filipinos) without evidence of prevalent albuminuria at baseline. Methods: Incident albuminuria was defined by positive urine albumin to creatinine level (>30 mg/g), and confirmed with repeat testing at least 3 months later. Results: The 27,292 person-years of observation yielded 981 incident albuminuria events. Agestandardized rates of albuminuria (per 1000 person-years) ranged from 13.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.5-17.0) in whites to 27.8 (CI 18.2- 38.3) in blacks. In fully adjusted Cox models, the hazard ratio for blacks (1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.38), Asians (1.35, 95% CI 1.13-1.61), and Filipinos (1.93, 95% CI 1.61-2.32), but not Hispanics, was significantly greater than it was for whites. In some cases, point estimates changed markedly from the base model when fully adjusted for potential confounders. Moreover, adjustment for an array of potentially mediating factors explained only a small proportion of the observed ethnic disparities. Conclusions: Despite uniform medical care coverage, Filipinos, blacks, and Asians with diabetes developed albuminuria at higher rates than white and Hispanic adults.

Study design for a comprehensive assessment of biologic safety using multiple healthcare data systems BACKGROUND: Although biologic treatments have excellent efficacy for many autoimmune diseases, safety concerns persist. Understanding the absolute and comparative risks of adverse events in patient and disease subpopulations is critical for optimal prescribing of biologics. PURPOSE: The Safety Assessment of Biologic Therapy collaborative was federally funded to provide robust estimates of rates and relative risks of adverse events among biologics users using data from national Medicaid and Medicare plus Medicaid dual-eligible programs, Tennessee Medicaid, Kaiser Permanente, and state pharmaceutical assistance programs supplementing New Jersey and Pennsylvania Medicare programs. This report describes the organizational structure of the collaborative and the study population and methods. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study (1998-2007) examined risks of seven classes of adverse events in relation to biologic treatments prescribed for seven autoimmune diseases. Propensity scores were used to control for confounding and enabled pooling of individual-level data across data systems while concealing personal health information. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to analyze study hypotheses. RESULTS: The cohort was composed of 159 000 subjects with rheumatic diseases, 33 000 with psoriasis, and 46 000 with inflammatory bowel disease. This report summarizes demographic characteristics and drug exposures. Separate reports will provide outcome definitions and estimated hazard ratios for adverse events. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive research will improve understanding of the safety of these treatments. The methods described may be useful to others planning similar evaluations.

Estimating the probability of neonatal early-onset infection on the basis of maternal risk factors OBJECTIVE: To develop a quantitative model to estimate the probability of neonatal early-onset bacterial infection on the basis of maternal intrapartum risk factors. METHODS: This was a nested case-control study of infants born at >/=34 weeks' gestation at 14 California and Massachusetts hospitals from 1993 to 2007. Case-subjects had culture-confirmed bacterial infection at <72 hours; controls were randomly selected, frequency-matched 3:1 according to year and birth hospital. We performed multivariate analyses and split validation to define a predictive model based only on information available in the immediate perinatal period. RESULTS: We identified 350 case-subjects from a cohort of 608 014 live births. Highest intrapartum maternal temperature revealed a linear relationship with risk of infection below 100.5 degrees F, above which the risk rose rapidly. Duration of rupture of membranes revealed a steadily increasing relationship with infection risk. Increased risk was associated with both late-preterm and postterm delivery. Risk associated with maternal group B Streptococcus colonization is diminished in the era of group B Streptococcus prophylaxis. Any form of intrapartum antibiotic given >4 hours before delivery was associated with decreased risk. Our model showed good discrimination and calibration (c statistic = 0.800 and Hosmer-Lemeshow P = .142 in the entire data set). CONCLUSIONS: A predictive model based on information available in the immediate perinatal period performs better than algorithms based on risk-factor threshold values. This model establishes a prior probability for newborn sepsis, which could be combined with neonatal physical examination and laboratory values to establish a posterior probability to guide treatment decisions.

We hypothesized that initiation of a new disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) would decrease the use of corticosteroids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and narcotics.Methods. Using administrative databases, we assembled 4 retrospective cohorts of RA patients (1998-2005) and identified 5 groups initiating DMARD regimens: methotrexate (MTX) with (new MTX) or without (first use of other nonbiologic DMARDs the (SSZ; new HCQ/SSZ)and new leflunomide (new LEF), both with previous use of MTX; and new tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) antagonists(new anti-TNF). We compared within-person differences in any use of cotherapies (>/= prescription) between the 6 months before and the 6-12 months after DMARD initiation.Results. Among increased by 15%, 5%,and 6%, respectively, in the 6 months before initiation compared to the previous 6 months, suggesting worsening of the disease. In the 6-12 months after initiation for most initiator groups, more patients stopped using corticosteroids and NSAIDs than started, with overall decreases of 8.9% The proportion of narcotic users changed little (overall decrease of 2.5%; 95% CI 1.9-3.0%).Conclusion. Use of all 3 cotherapies increased in the 6 months before initiation of new DMARD regimens for RA. Use of corticosteroids and NSAIDs decreased modestly 6-12 months after initiation, but there was only a very small decrease in narcotic use. These differential changes require further study.

Patient-Reported Racial/Ethnic Healthcare Provider Discrimination and Medication Intensification in the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) BACKGROUND: Racial/ethnic minority patients are more likely to report experiences with discrimination in the healthcare setting, potentially leading to reduced access to appropriate care; however, few studies evaluate reports of discrimination with objectively measured quality of care indicators. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether patient-reported racial/ethnic discrimination by healthcare providers was associated with evidence of poorer quality care measured by medication intensification. RESEARCH DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Baseline data from the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE), a random, race-stratified sample from the Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Registry from 2005-2006, including both survey and medical record data. MAIN MEASURES: Self-reported healthcare provider discrimination (from survey data) and medication intensification (from electronic prescription records) for poorly controlled diabetes patients (A1c >/=9.0%; 14% had and 32% had hypertension. Of those with hyperglycemia, 59% had their medications intensified, along with 40% with hyperlipidemia, 33% with hypertension, and 47% in poor control of any risk factor. In adjusted log-binomial GEE models, discrimination was not associated with medication intensification [RR = 0.96 (95% CI: RR 0.88, 1.33) for the composite cohort]. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that patient-reported healthcare discrimination was associated with less medication intensification. While not associated with this technical aspect of care, discrimination could still be associated with other aspects of care (e.g., patient-centeredness, Intern Med. 2011 Oct;26(10):1138-44.

Medicare part d and changes in prescription drug use and cost burden: national estimates for the medicare population, 2000 to 2007 CONTEXT: The full effect of Medicare Part D, after the initial policy transition period and across the United States Medicare population, remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To estimate nationally representative changes in prescription drug use and out-of-pocket drug costs 2 years after implementation of Part D. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We examined study outcomes over 8 years (2000 to 2007) and estimated changes after Part D, accounting for earlier trends. Our analyses used the community-dwelling sample of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (unweighted unique n=38,798). Actual post-Part D outcomes were compared with projected values using 2000 to 2005 data. Subgroup analyses and standardization weights were used to address population-level shifts over time in health status and demographic characteristics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Annual prescription drug fills and out-of-pocket drug costs. RESULTS: We observed significant average per person increases of 1.8 prescription fills [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.5] in 2006 and 3.4 prescription fills (95% CI, 2.7-4.1) in 2007 above pre-Part D increases of 0.9 prescription fills per year. Average out-of-pocket drug costs decreased significantly by $143 (95% CI, -182.5-103.1) in 2006 and $148 (95% CI, -181.2-114.1) in 2007 above average pre-Part D increases of $12 per year. Prescription fills did not change for beneficiaries with fair to poor health until 2007 when large increases occurred (increases of 3.7 to 11.0 fills above pre-Part D trends). Significant reductions in OOP drug costs occurred in 2006 and persisted into 2007 across all groups except for sick and poor beneficiaries without Medicaid. CONCLUSIONS: After the transition year of 2006, the impact of Part D seemed larger and more consistent across the Medicare population. Of note, sick and poor beneficiaries experienced significant improvements in prescription drug use in 2007. Authors: Briesacher BA; Sep;49(9):834-41. Cross-sectional and longitudinal changes of glucose effectiveness in relation to glucose tolerance: the insulin resistance atherosclerosis study OBJECTIVE: Glucose effectiveness (S(G)), the capacity of glucose to enhance its own disposition, is an independent predictor of future diabetes. However, there are data on cross-sectional and longitudinal changes of S(G) and its components, basal insulin effect on S(G) (BIE) and S(G) at zero insulin (GEZI), but the natural course of S(G) has not been described in a large population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: S(G) was measured at baseline in 1,265 participants (aged 40-69 years) and at the 5-year examination in 827 participants in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) using the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. None of these participants were treated with glucose-lowering agents. RESULTS: In cross-sectional analyses, S(G), BIE, and GEZI deteriorated with worsening of glucose tolerance (P < 0.001 for all three associations). In longitudinal analyses among subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at baseline, S(G), BIE, and GEZI declined in those who progressed to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or diabetes (P < 0.001 for all three measures). More modest longitudinal changes were demonstrated in individuals with IGT. The transition back to NGT (as opposed to no change) compared with the transition to diabetes was statistically significant for S(G) (P = 0.049) and BIE (P = 0.042) and was not a statistically significant trend for GEZI (P = 0.332). In individuals with diabetes, only BIE had a significant decline (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: S(G), BIE, and GEZI decline in subjects whose glycemic status worsens. S(G) and GEZI deteriorate more in the initial stages of the disease Epub 2011 Jul 25. Gender differences in quality of life among long-term colorectal cancer survivors with ostomies PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To describe how gender shapes the concerns and adaptations of long-term (i.e., more than five years) colorectal cancer survivors with ostomies. DESIGN: Qualitative study using content analysis of focus group content. SETTING: Oregon, southwestern Washington, and northern California. SAMPLE: Four female and four male focus groups (N = 33) selected from 282 quantitative survey participants with health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) scores in the highest or lowest quartile. METHODS: Eight focus groups discussed the challenges of living with an ostomy. Content was recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using directive and summative content analysis. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: HRQOL domains of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. FINDINGS: All groups reported avoiding foods that cause gas or rapid transit and discussed how limiting the amount of food eaten controlled the output. All groups discussed physical activities, getting support from friends and family, and the importance of being resilient. Both genders identified challenges with sexuality and intimacy. Coping and adjustment difficulties mostly were discussed by women, with men only discussing these issues to a small extent. Difficulties with sleep primarily were identified by women with low HRQOL. Problems with body image and depression were discussed only by women with low HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: Common issues included diet management, physical activity, social support, and sexuality. Although both genders identified challenges, women described more specific psychological and social issues than men. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Application of these gender-based differences can inform educational interventions for colorectal cancer 2011 Sep;38(5):587-96. Correlates of quality of life in older adults with diabetes: the diabetes & aging study OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between health-related quality of life (HRQL) and geriatric syndromes, diabetes complications, and hypoglycemia in older adults with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A race-stratified random sample of 6,317 adults with type 2 or type 1 diabetes, aged 60 to 75 years, enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, who completed a survey that included a HRQL instrument based on the Short Form 8-item health survey. Administrative records were used to ascertain diagnoses of geriatric syndromes, diabetes complications, and hypoglycemia. Associations were estimated between HRQL and exposures in exposure-specific and combined exposure models (any syndrome, any complication, or hypoglycemia). Conservatively, differences of >/=3 points were considered the minimally important difference in HRQL scores. RESULTS: HRQL was lower with nearly all exposures of interest. The lowest physical HRQL was associated with amputation. In combined exposure models, geriatric syndromes (-5.3 [95% CI -5.8 complications (-3.5 [-4.0 to -2.9], P < 0.001) were associated with lower physical HRQL. The lowest mental HRQL was associated with depression, underweight (BMI <18 kg/m(2)), amputation, and hypoglycemia. In combined exposure models, only hypoglycemia was associated with lower mental HRQL (-4.0 [-7.0 to -1.1], P = 0.008). and hypoglycemia are associated with lower HRQL to a comparable degree as diabetes complications. Addressing geriatric syndromes and avoiding hypoglycemia should be given as high a priority as preventing diabetes complications in older adults with diabetes. 2011 Aug;34(8):1749-53.

Epidemiology of apnea and bradycardia resolution in premature infants BACKGROUND: There is little epidemiologic evidence to assess the maturation of respiratory control in premature infants. OBJECTIVE: To measure the success rate or the percentage of infants who have no additional events of various apnea- or bradycardia-free intervals after correcting for gestational age, postmenstrual age of the last apnea or bradycardia event, and the severity of the event. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age or earlier at 1 of 5 Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program hospitals between 1998 and 2001. The success rates of various apnea- or bradycardia-free intervals were calculated after stratifying according to gestational age, postmenstrual age of the last event, or event severity. RESULTS: Among the 1403 infants identified in this study, 84.2% did not have an apnea event and 78.5% did not have a bradycardia event after they were otherwise ready for discharge. For the entire cohort, a 95% success rate was statistically reached, with a 7-day apnea- or bradycardia-free interval. Infants with a gestational age of 30 weeks or less had a 5% to 15% lower success rate than infants with a gestational age more than 30 weeks for any given apnea- or bradycardia-free interval. The success rate was reduced by an additional 5% to 10% if the last apnea or bradycardia event occurred at a postmenstrual age of more than 36 weeks. Including only the most severe events slightly improved the success rate of a given interval. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of recurrence for apnea or bradycardia differs depending on the gestational age of the infant and the postmenstrual age of the last apnea 2011 Jul 11. Derivation and validation of a model to predict daily risk of death in hospital BACKGROUND: As electronic patient data from automated hospital databases become increasingly available, it is important to explore the ways in which these data could be used for the purposes other than patient care, such as quality assurance and improvement. OBJECTIVE: To determine if information from automated patient databases can be used to derive a model that can predict patients' daily risk of death in hospital. Such a model could be used to improve the ability to risk-adjust hospital mortality rates. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort study of 159,794 hospitalizations at The Ottawa Hospital between April 1, 2004 and March 31, 2009. The model was derived using time-dependent Cox regression methods on a random two-thirds of admissions. The model was validated by applying the coefficients to the other third of admissions. RESULTS: Inpatient mortality was 5%. The final model included: patient age; admission type; intensive care unit status; alternative level of care status; and separate scores for patient comorbidity, in-hospital procedures, and acute illness (using information from 14 laboratory tests). In the validation set, the model had excellent discrimination (c-statistic 0.879, 95% confidence interval: 0.872-0.886) and calibration in all risk strata over all admission days. CONCLUSION: We found that information from our hospital's automated patient databases could be used to accurately predict patients' daily risk of death in hospital. The predictions from this model could be used in quality of care analyses to more accurately risk-adjust hospital mortality rates and by hospitals to improve triage processes and patient flow.

Preservation of fertility after partial resection of bilateral ovarian cystadenofibromas: a case report BACKGROUND: Benign cystadenofibromas and adenofibromas may represent precursors to malignant lesions. CASE: A 20-year-old woman undergoing infertility treatment was found to have cystadenofibromas involving both ovaries, with no separable normal ovarian tissue visible. Because complete resection of the tumors would have required bilateral oophorectomy, the tumors were only partially resected using a shave technique. This patient subsequently had 3 normal-term deliveries over 7 years and did not have any clinically significant regrowth of her tumors during this time. CONCLUSION: It may be reasonable to delay removing benign tumors in a young woman who has not completed her childbearing. Authors: Ewing TL; Suh-Burgmann B J Reprod Med. 2011 Jul-Aug;56(7-8):364-5. Temporal trends in recording of diabetes on death certificates: results from Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency that diabetes is reported on death certificates of decedents with known diabetes and describe trends in reporting over 8 years. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were obtained from 11,927 participants with diabetes who were enrolled in Translating Research into Action for Diabetes, a multicenter prospective observational study of diabetes care in managed care. Data on decedents (N=2,261) were obtained from the National Death Index from 1 January 2000 through 31 December 2007. The primary dependent variables were the presence of the ICD-10 codes for diabetes listed anywhere on the death certificate or as the underlying cause of death. RESULTS: Diabetes was recorded on 41% of death certificates and as the underlying cause of death for 13% of decedents with diabetes. Diabetes was significantly more likely to be reported on the death certificate of decedents dying of cardiovascular disease than all other causes. There was a statistically significant trend of increased reporting of diabetes as the underlying cause of death over time (P<0.001), which persisted after controlling for duration of diabetes at death. The increase in reporting of diabetes as the underlying cause of death was associated with a decrease in the reporting of cardiovascular disease as the underlying cause of death (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Death certificates continue to underestimate the prevalence of diabetes among decedents. The increase in reporting of diabetes as the underlying cause of death over the past 8 years will likely impact estimates of the burden of diabetes in the U.S. 2011 Glycemic control, complications, and death in older diabetic patients: the diabetes and aging study OBJECTIVE: To identify the range of glycemic levels associated with the lowest rates of complications and mortality in older diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study (2004-2008) of 71,092 patients with type 2 diabetes, aged >/=60 years, enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We specified Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the relationships between baseline glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and subsequent outcomes (nonfatal complications [acute metabolic, microvascular, and events] and 71.0 +/- 7.4 years [means had a mean of 7.0 +/- 1.2%. The risk of any nonfatal complication rose monotonically for levels of A1C >6.0% (e.g., adjusted hazard ratio 1.09 [95% CI A1C 6.0-6.9% and 1.86 [1.63-2.13] >/=11.0%). Mortality had a U-shaped relationship with A1C. Compared with the risk with A1C <6.0%, mortality risk was lower for A1C levels between 6.0 and 9.0% (e.g., 0.83 [0.76-0.90] 7.0-7.9%) and higher at A1C >/=11.0% (1.31 [1.09-1.57]). Risk of any end point (complication or death) became significantly higher at A1C >/=8.0%. Patterns generally were consistent across age-groups (60-69, 70-79, and >/=80 years). CONCLUSIONS: Observed relationships between A1C and combined end points support setting a target of A1C <8.0% for older patients, with the caution that A1Cs <6.0% were associated with increased mortality risk. Additional research is needed to evaluate the low A1C-mortality relationship, as well as protocols for individualizing diabetes care. Huang ES; Liu JY; Diabetes Care. 2011 Jun;34(6):1329-36.

Racial and ethnic disparities in postpartum depression care among low-income women OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to characterize racial-ethnic differences in mental health care utilization associated with postpartum depression in a multiethnic cohort of Medicaid recipients. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, administrative claims data from New Jersey's Medicaid program were obtained for 29,601 women (13,001 whites, 13,416 blacks, and 3,184 Latinas) who delivered babies between July 2004 and October 2007. Racial-ethnic differences were estimated with logistic regression for initiation of antidepressant medication or outpatient mental health visits within six months of delivery, follow-up (a prescription refill or second visit), and continued mental health care (at least three visits or three filled antidepressant prescriptions within 120 days). RESULTS: Nine percent (N=1,120) of white women initiated postpartum mental health care, compared with 4% (N=568) of black women and 5% (N=162) of Latinas. With analyses controlling for clinical factors, the odds of initiating treatment after delivery were significantly (p<.001) lower for blacks (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=.43) and Latinas (AOR=.59) compared with whites. Among those who initiated treatment, blacks and Latinas were less likely than whites to receive follow-up treatment (blacks, AOR=.66, p<.001; AOR=.67, p<.05). Among those who initiated antidepressant treatment, black women and Latinas were less likely than whites to refill a prescription. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant racial-ethnic differences in depression-related mental health care after delivery. Suboptimal treatment was prevalent among all low-income women in the study. However, racial and ethnic disparities in the initiation and continuation of postpartum depression care were particularly troubling and warrant clinical and policy attention.

Advancing the science of patient safety Despite a decade's worth of effort, patient safety has improved slowly, in part because of the limited evidence base for the development and widespread dissemination of successful patient safety practices. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality sponsored an international group of experts in patient safety and evaluation methods to develop criteria to improve the design, evaluation, and reporting of practice research in patient safety. This article reports the findings and recommendations of this group, which include greater use of theory and logic models, more detailed descriptions of interventions and their implementation, enhanced explanation of desired and unintended outcomes, and better description and measurement of context and of how context influences interventions. Using these criteria and measuring and reporting contexts will improve the science of patient safety. Authors: Shekelle PG; Adams AS; Walshe K; et al. Ann Intern Med. 2011 May 17;154(10):693-6. Social disparities in internet patient portal use in diabetes: evidence that the digital divide extends beyond access The authors investigated use of the internet-based patient portal, kp.org, among a well-characterized population of adults with diabetes in Northern California. Among 14,102 diverse patients, 5671 (40%) requested a password for the patient portal. Of these, 4311 (76%) activated their accounts, and 3922 (69%), logged on to the patient portal one or more times; 2990 (53%) participants viewed laboratory results, 2132 (38%) requested medication refills, 2093 (37%) sent email messages, and 835 (15%) made medical appointments. After adjustment for age, gender, race/ethnicity, immigration status, educational attainment, and employment status, compared to non-Hispanic Caucasians, African-Americans and Latinos had higher odds of never logging on (OR 2.6 (2.3 to 2.9); OR 2.3 (1.9 to 2.6)), as did those without an educational degree (OR compared to college graduates, 2.3 (1.9 to 2.7)). Those most at risk for poor diabetes outcomes may fall further behind as health systems increasingly rely on the internet and limit current modes of access and communication.

Age-dependent gender differences in hypertension management OBJECTIVE: Despite gender-neutral guidelines, prior studies suggest that women have lower rates of hypertension control and these differences may vary with age. Accordingly, we compared rates of hypertension control between women and men as a function of age. METHODS: Within three integrated healthcare systems in the Cardiovascular Research Network, we studied all patients seen from 2001 to 2007 with incident hypertension. Within 1 year of cohort entry, patient's hypertension was categorized as controlled based upon achieving guideline-recommended blood pressure levels, recognized if hypertension was diagnosed or a hypertension medication dispensed, and treated based on hypertension medications dispensed. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed the association between gender and 1-year hypertension outcomes, adjusted for patient characteristics. RESULTS: Among the 152,561 patients with incident hypertension, 55.6% were women. Compared to men, women were older, had more kidney disease and more blood pressure measures during follow-up. Overall, men tended to have lower rates of hypertension control compared to women (41.2 vs. 45.7%, adjusted odds ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.91-0.95). A significant gender by age interaction was found with men aged 18-49 having 17% lower odds of hypertension control and men aged at least 65 having 12% higher odds of hypertension control compared to women of similar ages (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: In this incident hypertension cohort, younger men and older women had lower rates of hypertension control compared to similarly aged peers. Future studies should investigate why gender differences vary by age in order to plan appropriate means of improving hypertension management regardless of gender or age.

Primary Language, Income and the Intensification of Anti-glycemic Medications in Managed Care: the (TRIAD) Study BACKGROUND: Patients who speak Spanish and/or have low socioeconomic status are at greater risk of suboptimal glycemic control. Inadequate intensification of anti-glycemic medications may partially explain this disparity. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between primary language, income, and medication intensification. DESIGN: Cohort study with 18-month follow-up. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine patients with Type 2 diabetes who were not using insulin enrolled in the Translating Research into Action for Diabetes Study (TRIAD), a study of diabetes care in managed care. MEASUREMENTS: Using administrative pharmacy data, we compared the odds of medication intensification for patients with baseline A1c >/= 8%, by primary language and annual income. Covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, Charlson score, diabetes duration, baseline A1c, type of diabetes treatment, and health plan. RESULTS: Overall, 42.4% of patients were taking intensified regimens at the time of follow-up. We found no difference in the odds of intensification for English speakers versus Spanish speakers. However, compared to patients with incomes <$15,000, patients with incomes of $15,000-$39,999 (OR 1.43, 1.07-1.92), $40,000-$74,999 (OR 1.62, 1.16-2.26) or >$75,000 (OR 2.22, 1.53-3.24) had increased odds of intensification. This latter pattern did not differ statistically by race. CONCLUSIONS: Low-income patients were less likely to receive medication intensification compared to higher-income patients, but primary language (Spanish vs. English) was not associated with differences in intensification in a managed care setting. Future studies are needed to explain the reduced rate of intensification among low income patients in managed care. J Gen Intern Med. 2011 May;26(5):505-11. Epub 2010 Dec 21. Adherence to laboratory test requests by patients with diabetes: the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) OBJECTIVES: To estimate rates and predictors of clinical laboratory test completion by patients with diabetes after provider referral. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Among 186,306 adult members with diabetes in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, we searched the electronic medical records (July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009) of each patient for the first outpatient order to obtain the following laboratory tests commonly used to measure risk factor control or adverse effects of pharmacotherapy: levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, low urinary albumin, creatine kinase (the latter only among persons using statins). We measured laboratory test attendance as completion of an order (including time to results) within 6 months of the referral date and looked for variations by subgroups. RESULTS: Laboratory test attendance ranged from 86% for glycosylated hemoglobin level to 73% for serum creatinine level. Time to laboratory test attendance was a median of 7 to 11 days and a mean of 25 to 30 days. Laboratory test attendance was more likely for women and older patients or for orders after a face-to-face provider visit and was less likely for orders by a pharmacist. However, most variations (even by laboratory copayment) were small or not clinically substantive. In subanalyses, we observed no clinically significant variations by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, trust in provider, or patient-provider communication and found no association with depressive symptoms, health literacy, or English fluency. CONCLUSION: The fact that 1 in 7 patients did not complete laboratory tests within 6 months of the provider referral may help explain why healthcare services seem to fall short of optimal diabetes Am J Manag Care. 2011 May;17(5):339-44. Competing demands for time and self-care behaviors, processes of care, and intermediate outcomes among people with diabetes: Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) OBJECTIVE: To determine whether competing demands for time affect diabetes self-care behaviors, processes of care, and intermediate outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used survey and medical record data from 5,478 participants in Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) and hierarchical regression models to examine the cross-sectional associations between competing demands for time and diabetes outcomes, including self-management, processes of care, and intermediate health outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of participants reported no competing demands, 7% reported caregiving responsibilities only, 36% reported employment responsibilities only, and 6% reported both caregiving and employment responsibilities. For both women and men, employment responsibilities (with or without caregiving responsibilities) were associated with lower rates of diabetes self-care behaviors, worse processes of care, and, in men, worse HbA(1c). CONCLUSIONS: Accommodations for competing demands for time may promote self-management and improve the processes and outcomes of care for employed adults with diabetes. Authors: Apr 4. Interpreting conjugated bilirubin levels in newborns OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical significance of elevated conjugated bilirubin (CB) levels in newborns. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective study evaluated a birth cohort of 271 186 full-term newborns born within a Northern California hospital network from 1995 to 2004. All CB and direct bilirubin (DB) levels were available in a database and were correlated with the patients' inpatient and outpatient International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision diagnoses. RESULTS: The 99th percentile for CB is 0.5 mg/dL, and the 99th percentile for DB is 2.1 mg/dL. CB levels between 0.5 and 1.9 mg/dL can be associated with infection, but most often remain unexplained. Liver and biliary disease become increasingly likely as CB levels increase; for CB >/=5 mg/dL, 47% of newborns have biliary disease and 43% have liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: CB and DB levels are not interchangeable. In newborns with CB levels >/=0.5 mg/dL and <2 mg/dL, infection must be ruled out, and the newborn should be observed. In newborns with levels >/=2 mg/dL, a more in-depth assessment of the hepatobiliary system is indicated. Authors: Davis AR; Rosenthal Newman 2011 Apr;158(4):562-565.e1. Epub 2010 Nov 12. Heterogeneity of diabetes outcomes among asians and pacific islanders in the US; the diabetes study of northern california (DISTANCE) OBJECTIVE: Ethnic minorities with diabetes typically have lower rates of cardiovascular outcomes and higher rates of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) compared with whites. Diabetes outcomes among Asian and Pacific Islander subgroups have not been disaggregated. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study (1996-2006) of patients enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry. There were 64,211 diabetic patients, including whites (n = 40,286), blacks (n = 8,668), Latinos (n = 7,763), Filipinos (n = 3,572), Chinese (n = 1,823), Japanese (n = 951), Pacific Islanders (n = 593), and South Asians (n = 555), enrolled in the registry. We calculated incidence rates (means +/- SD; 7.2 +/- 3.3 years follow-up) and created Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, educational attainment, English proficiency, neighborhood deprivation, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, exercise, medication adherence, type and duration of diabetes, HbA(1c), hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, and LDL cholesterol. Incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure, stroke, ESRD, and lower-extremity amputation (LEA) were age and sex adjusted. RESULTS: Pacific Islander women had the highest incidence of MI, whereas other ethnicities had significantly lower rates of MI than whites. Most nonwhite groups had higher rates of ESRD than whites. Asians had ~60% lower incidence of LEA compared with whites, African Americans, or Pacific Islanders. Incidence rates in Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos were similar for most complications. For the three macrovascular complications, Pacific Islanders and South Asians had rates similar to whites. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of complications varied dramatically among the Asian subgroups and highlights the value of a more nuanced ethnic stratification for public health surveillance Diabetes Care. 2011 Apr;34(4):930-7.

Missed opportunities in cardiovascular disease prevention?: low rates of hypertension recognition for women at medicine and obstetrics-gynecology clinics Younger women use both internal medicine and obstetrics-gynecology (OBGYN) clinics as primary sources of health care. However, the role of OBGYN clinics in cardiovascular disease prevention is largely unexplored. The objective of this study was to examine rates of hypertension recognition in women<50 years of age who presented with elevated blood pressures in family practice and internal medicine (medicine) OBGYN clinics and to compare these rates across clinic type. The study's population consisted of 34 627 nonpregnant women ages 18 to 49 years with new-onset hypertension (defined as 2 consecutive visits with elevated blood pressures of systolic blood pressure>/=140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure>/=90 mm Hg with no previous hypertension history) from 2002 to 2006. Multivariate logistic regressions predicting the clinical recognition of hypertension (a recorded diagnosis of hypertension and/or an antihypertensive prescription by any provider within 1 year of the second elevated blood pressure) assessed the association between hypertension recognition and the clinic where the second elevated blood pressure was recorded. Analysis showed that hypertension was recognized in <33% of women with new-onset hypertension. Women whose second consecutive elevated blood pressure was recorded in OBGYN clinics were less likely to be recognized as having hypertension within 12 months by any provider compared with women whose second consecutive elevated blood pressure was recorded in a medicine clinic (odds ratio: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.48 to 0.54]). This study suggests that further attention be paid to identifying and treating cardiovascular disease risk factors in women<50 years of age presenting in both medicine and OBGYN clinics and that improved coordination across care settings has the potential to improve cardiovascular disease prevention in young women.

The reliability of diagnostic coding and laboratory data to identify tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterial disease among rheumatoid arthritis patients using anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy PURPOSE: Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF) therapies are associated with severe mycobacterial infections in rheumatoid arthritis patients. We developed and validated electronic record search algorithms for these serious infections. METHODS: The study used electronic clinical, microbiologic, and pharmacy records from Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center (PVAMC). We identified suspect tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) cases using inpatient and outpatient diagnostic codes, culture results, and anti-tuberculous medication dispensing. We manually reviewed records to validate our case-finding algorithms. RESULTS: We identified 64 tuberculosis and 367 NTM potential cases, respectively. For tuberculosis, diagnostic code positive predictive value (PPV) was 54% at KPNC and 9% at PVAMC. Adding medication dispensings improved these to 87% and 46%, respectively. Positive tuberculosis cultures had a PPV of 100% with sensitivities of 79% (KPNC) and 55% (PVAMC). KPNC, >/= and 74%) species PVAMC, culture identified 76% of cases with PPV of 41%. Application of the American Thoracic Society NTM the highest PPV (100% KPNC, 78% PVAMC). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and predictive value of electronic microbiologic data for tuberculosis and NTM infections is generally high, but varies with different facilities or models of care. Unlike NTM, tuberculosis diagnostic codes have poor PPV, and in the absence of laboratory data, should be combined with anti-tuberculous therapy dispensings for Complications among colorectal cancer survivors: preference-weighted quality of life scores BACKGROUND: Societal preference-weighted health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores enable comparing multidimensional health states across diseases and treatments for research and policy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of living with a permanent intestinal stoma, compared with a major bowel resection, among colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional multivariate linear regression analysis to explain preference-weighted HRQOL scores. SUBJECTS: In all, 640 CRC survivors (>/= 5 years) from 3 group model health maintenance organizations; ostomates and nonostomates with colorectal resections for CRC were matched on gender, age (+/- 5 years), time since diagnosis, and tumor site (rectum vs. colon). MEASURES: SF-6D scoring system was applied to Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 version 2 (SF-36v2); City of Hope Quality of Life-Ostomy; and Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index. METHODS: Survey of CRC survivors linked to respondents' clinical data extracted from health maintenance organization files. RESULTS: Response rate was 52%. Ostomates and nonostomates had similar sociodemographic characteristics. Mean SF-6D was 0.69 for ostomates, compared with 0.73 for nonostomates (P < 0.001), but other factors explained this difference. Complications of initial cancer surgery, and previous year comorbidity burden, and hospital use were negatively associated with SF-6D scores, whereas household income was positively associated. CONCLUSIONS: CRC survivors' SF-6D scores were not associated with living with a permanent ostomy after other factors were taken into account. Surgical complications, comorbidities, and metastatic disease lowered the preference-weighted HRQOL of CRC survivors with and without ostomies.

Triglycerides and amputation risk in patients with diabetes: ten-year follow-up in the DISTANCE study OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between triglyceride levels and lower-extremity amputation (LEA) risk in a large diabetic cohort. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a 10-year survey follow-up study (from 1995-2006) of 28,701 diabetic patients with a baseline triglyceride measure. All patients were fully insured members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program and responded to a survey at baseline that included information on ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, behavioral factors, and information required to determine type of diabetes. The relationship between triglycerides and time to incident nontraumatic LEA, defined by primary hospitalization discharge or procedures, was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Triglyceride level was an independent, stepwise risk factor for nontraumatic LEAs within this large diabetic cohort: triglycerides 150-199 Hypertriglyceridemia is a significant risk factor for LEA in diabetic patients even after controlling for known socioeconomic, health behavioral, and clinical factors. This previously unrecognized clinical risk needs to be further investigated to determine if treatment of triglycerides can reduce amputation risk. Authors: Epub 2011 Feb 1. A syndemic model of substance abuse, intimate partner violence, HIV infection, and mental health among Hispanics. Hispanics are disproportionately affected by substance abuse, HIV infection, intimate partner violence, and mental health conditions. To address health disparities among Hispanics and other vulnerable groups, it is necessary to understand the complex interactions between health conditions clustering together (e.g., substance abuse, intimate partner violence, and HIV) and the social ecology in which these conditions exist. A syndemic orientation, a consideration of clustering epidemics and common individual, relationship, cultural, and socioenvironmental factors linking these conditions, may be helpful in developing comprehensive models that expand our ability to understand and address health disparities. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a Syndemic Model of Substance Abuse, Intimate Partner Violence, HIV Infection, and Mental Health among Hispanics, and provide evidence from the research literature to support the central relationships and risk and protective factors (i.e., potential links between conditions) depicted by the model. The development and evaluation of interventions aimed at the prevention of substance abuse, intimate partner violence, HIV/AIDS, and mental health problems as a syndemic affecting Hispanics is urgently needed. Public health nurses can initiate this endeavor with the guidance of a Syndemic Model.

Association between prior authorization for medications and health service use by Medicaid patients with bipolar disorder OBJECTIVE: This study examined the association between a Medicaid prior-authorization policy for second-generation antipsychotic and anticonvulsant agents and medication discontinuation and health service use by patients with bipolar disorder. METHODS: A pre-post design with a historical comparison group was used to analyze Maine Medicaid and Medicare claims data. A total of 946 newly treated patients were identified during the eight-month policy (July 2003-February 2004), and a comparison group of 1,014 was identified from the prepolicy period (July 2002-February 2003). Patients were stratified by number of visits to community mental health centers (CMHCs) before medication initiation (proxy for illness severity): CMHC attenders, at least two visits; nonattenders, fewer than two. Changes in rates of medication discontinuation and outpatient, emergency room, and hospital visits were estimated. RESULTS: Compared with nonattenders, at baseline CMHC attenders had substantially higher rates of comorbid mental disorders and use of medications and health services. The policy was associated with increased medication discontinuation among attenders and nonattenders, reductions in mental health visits after discontinuation among attenders (-.64 per patient per month; p<.05), and increases in emergency room visits after discontinuation among nonattenders (.16 per patient per month; p<.05). During the eight-month policy period, the policy had no detectable impact on hospitalization risk. CONCLUSIONS: The prior-authorization policy was associated with increased medication discontinuation and subsequent changes in health service use. Although small, these unintended effects raise concerns about quality of care for a group of vulnerable patients. Long-term consequences of prior-authorization policies on patient outcomes warrant further investigation. Authors: Lu to improve postpartum depression care did not change treatment patterns for women on medicaid Identification and treatment of postpartum depression are the increasing focus of state and national legislation, including portions of the Affordable Care Act. Some state policies and proposals are modeled directly on programs in New Jersey, the first state to require universal screening for postpartum depression among mothers who recently delivered babies. We examined the impact of these policies on a particularly vulnerable population, Medicaid recipients, and found that neither the required screening nor the educational campaign that preceded it was associated with improved treatment initiation, follow-up, or continued care. We argue that New Jersey's policies, although well intentioned, were predicated on an inadequate base of evidence and that efforts should now be undertaken to build that base. We also argue that to improve detection and treatment, policy makers contemplating or implementing postpartum depression mandates should consider additional measures. These could include requiring mechanisms to monitor and enforce the screening requirement; paying providers to execute screening and follow-up; and preliminary testing of interventions before policy changes are enacted. Authors: Kozhimannil KB; Adams Language barriers, physician-patient language concordance, and glycemic control among insured Latinos with diabetes: the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of US Latinos with diabetes have limited English proficiency (LEP). Whether language barriers in health care contribute to poor glycemic control is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between limited English proficiency (LEP) and glycemic control and whether this association is modified by having a language-concordant physician. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, observational study using data from the 2005-2006 Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE). Patients received care in a managed care setting with interpreter services and self-reported their English language ability and the Spanish language ability of their physician. Outcome was poor glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin A1c > 9%). KEY RESULTS: The unadjusted percentage of patients with poor glycemic control was similar among Latino patients with LEP (n = 510) and Latino English-speakers (n = 2,683), and higher in both groups than in whites (n = 3,545) (21% vs 18% vs. 10%, p < 0.005). This relationship differed significantly by patient-provider language concordance (p < 0.01 for interaction). LEP patients with language-discordant physicians (n = 115) were more likely than LEP patients with language-concordant physicians (n = 137) to have poor glycemic control (27.8% vs 16.1% p = 0.02). After controlling for potential demographic and clinical confounders, LEP Latinos with language-concordant physicians had similar odds of poor glycemic control as Latino English speakers (OR 0.89; CI 0.53-1.49), whereas LEP Latinos with language-discordant physicians had greater odds of poor control than Latino English speakers (OR 1.76; CI 1.04-2.97). Among LEP Latinos, having a language discordant physician was associated with significantly poorer glycemic control (OR 1.98; CI 1.03-3.80). CONCLUSIONS: Language barriers contribute to health disparities among Latinos with diabetes. Limited English proficiency is an independent predictor for poor glycemic control among insured US Latinos with diabetes, an association not observed when care is provided by language-concordant physicians. Future research should determine if strategies to increase language-concordant care improve glycemic control among US 2011 Feb;26(2):170-6. Epub 2010 Sep 29. Urine bisphenol-A (BPA) level in relation to semen quality OBJECTIVE: To determine whether urine bisphenol-A (BPA) levels are associated with lower semen quality. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Four regions in China where high exposure to BPA in the workplace existed. PATIENT(S): 218 men with and without BPA exposure in the workplace. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Semen parameters. RESULT(S): After adjustment for potential confounders using linear regression, increasing urine BPA level was statistically significantly associated with [1] decreased sperm concentration, [2] decreased total sperm count, [3] decreased sperm vitality, and [4] decreased sperm motility. Compared with men who did not have detectable urine BPA levels, those with detectable urine BPA had more than three times the risk of lowered sperm concentration and lower sperm vitality, more than four times the risk of lower sperm count, and more than twice the risk of lower sperm motility. The urine BPA level was not associated with semen volume or abnormal sperm morphology. Similar dose-response associations were observed among men with environmental BPA exposure at levels comparable with those in the U.S population. Despite a markedly reduced sample size, the inverse correlation between increased urine BPA levels and decreased sperm concentration and total sperm count remained statistically significant. CONCLUSION(S): These results provide the first epidemiologic evidence of an adverse effect of BPA on semen quality. Authors: Li DK; 2010 Oct 29. Correlates of patient-reported racial/ethnic health care discrimination in the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) OBJECTIVES: We examined possible determinants of self-reported health care discrimination. METHODS: We examined survey data from the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE), a race-stratified sample of Kaiser diabetes patients. Respondents reported perceived discrimination, and regression models examined socioeconomic, acculturative, and psychosocial correlates. RESULTS: Subjects East 11% Filipinos, and 27% Whites. Three percent and 20% reported health care and general discrimination. Health care discrimination was more frequently reported by minorities (ORs ranging from 2.0 to 2.9 compared with Whites) and those with poorer health literacy (OR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.04-1.16), addition to race/ethnicity, health literacy and English proficiency may be bases of discrimination.

Impact of prior authorization on the use and costs of lipid-lowering medications among Michigan and Indiana dual enrollees in Medicaid and Medicare: results of a longitudinal, population-based study BACKGROUND: Some Medicaid programs have adopted prior-authorization (PA) policies that require prescribers to request approval from Medicaid before prescribing drugs not included on a preferred drug list. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the association between PA policies for lipid-lowering agents in Michigan and Indiana and the use and cost of this drug class among dual enrollees in Medicare and Medicaid. METHODS: Michigan and Indiana claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were assessed. Michigan Medicaid instituted a PA requirement for several lipid-lowering medications in March 2002; Indiana implemented a PA policy for drugs in this class in September 2002. Although the PA policies affected some statins, they predominantly targeted second-line treatments, including bile acid sequestrants, fibrates, and niacins. Individuals aged >/=18 years who were continuously dually enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid from July 2000 through September 2003 were included in this longitudinal, population-based study, which included a 20-month observation period before the implementation of PA in Michigan and a 12-month follow-up period after the Indiana PA policy was initiated. Interrupted time series analysis was used to examine changes in prescription rates and pharmacy costs for lipid-lowering drugs before and after policy implementation. RESULTS: A total of 38,684 dual enrollees in Michigan and 29,463 in Indiana were included. Slightly more than half of the cohort were female (Michigan, 53.3% [20,614/38,684]; Indiana, 56.3% [16,595/29,463]); nearly half were aged 45 to 64 years (Michigan, 43.7% [16,921/38,684]; Indiana, 45.2% [13,321/29,463]). [29,957/38,684]; Indiana: 84.9% [25,022/29,463]). The PA policy was associated with an immediate 58% reduction in prescriptions for nonpreferred medications in Michigan and a corresponding increase in prescriptions for preferred agents. However, the PA policy had no apparent effect in Indiana, where there had been little use of nonpreferred medications before the policy was implemented (3.3%). The policies were associated with an immediate reduction of $24,548 in prescription expenditures in Michigan and an immediate reduction of $16,070 in Indiana. CONCLUSIONS: The PA policy was associated with substantially lower use of nonpreferred lipid-lowering drugs in Michigan, offset by increases in the use of preferred medications, but there was less change in Indiana. Data limitations did not permit the evaluation of the impact of policy-induced switching on clinical outcomes such as cholesterol levels. The monetary benefit of PA policies for lipid-lowering agents should be weighed against administrative costs and the burden on patients and health care providers. Authors: Lu CY; Variation in diagnosis of apnea in moderately preterm infants predicts length of stay OBJECTIVE: Apnea of prematurity is one of the most common diagnoses in the NICU. Because resolution of apnea is a usual precondition for discharge from the hospital, different monitoring practices might affect length of stay for premature infants. Our objective was to compare the proportion of 33 to 34 weeks' gestational age infants diagnosed with apnea in different NICUs and to assess whether variability in length of stay would be affected by the rate of documented apnea. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of moderately preterm infants who survived to discharge in 10 NICUs in Massachusetts and California. RESULTS: The study population comprised 536 infants born between 33 and 34/7 weeks of which 264 (49%) were diagnosed with apnea. The mean postmenstrual age at discharge was higher in infants diagnosed with apnea compared with those without apnea (36.4 +/- 1.3 vs 35.7 +/- 0.8; P < .001, analysis of variance). Significant inter-NICU variation existed in the proportion of infants diagnosed with apnea (range: 24%-76%; P < .001). Postmenstrual age at discharge also varied between NICUs (range: 35.5 +/- 0.6 to 36.7 +/- 1.5 weeks; P < .001). As much as 28% of the variability in postmenstrual age at discharge between NICUs could be explained by the variability in the proportion of infants diagnosed with apnea. CONCLUSIONS: NICUs vary in the proportion of moderately preterm infants diagnosed with apnea, which significantly affects length of stay. Standardization of monitoring practices and definition of clinically significant cardiorespiratory events could have a significant impact on reducing the length of stay in moderately preterm infants.

Correlates of depression among people with diabetes: The Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) study AIM: The broad objective of this study was to examine multiple dimensions of depression in a large, diverse population of adults with diabetes. Specific aims were to measure the association of depression with: (1) patient characteristics; (2) outcomes; and (3) diabetes-related quality of care. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses were performed using survey and chart data from the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) study, including 8790 adults with diabetes, enrolled in 10 managed care health plans in 7 states. Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Patient characteristics, outcomes and quality of care were measured using validated survey items and chart data. RESULTS: Nearly 18% of patients had major depression, with prevalence 2-3 times higher among patients with low socioeconomic status. Pain and limited mobility were strongly associated with depression, controlling for other patient characteristics. Depression was associated with slightly worse glycemic control, but not other intermediate clinical outcomes. Depressed patients received slightly fewer recommended diabetes-related processes of care. CONCLUSIONS: In a large, diverse cohort of patients with diabetes, depression was most prevalent among patients with low socioeconomic status and those with pain, and was associated with slightly worse glycemic control and quality of care.

Respiratory syncytial virus testing during bronchiolitis episodes of care in an integrated health care delivery system: a retrospective cohort study BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis has the highest incidence rate of any lower respiratory infection among infants and children <2 years of age. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common etiology of bronchiolitis. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend routine RSV testing for infants and children with bronchiolitis. The clinical predictors of RSV testing are unknown. Objectives: The aims of this study were to identify the rates and predictors of RSV testing during bronchiolitis and to explore the relationship between RSV test results and antibiotic treatment among infants and children aged <2 years. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of 123,264 infants >/=32 weeks' gestational age (GA) who were born at 1 of 6 Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Center Program hospitals between 1996 and 2004. A bronchiolitis episode of care (EOC) was defined as >/=1 medical encounters with a bronchiolitis diagnosis code followed by 14 clear days without a bronchiolitis-related medical encounter. Descriptive statistics were used to report the frequency of tests, and logistic regression was used to assess the effect of hospitalization, chronologic age, gestational age, and season on the frequency of testing for RSV. Rapid direct fluorescent antibody testing was performed during the study. RESULTS: The birth cohort was 51.2% male and 42.7% white, 20.8% Hispanic, 20.3% Asian, for 44.2% of all tests were positive for RSV. Physicians ordered RSV tests in 30.4% and 26.7% of bronchiolitis EOCs for infants born at 32 to 33 and 34 to 36 weeks' GA, respectively, compared with 17.9% of bronchiolitis EOCs for infants born at >/=41 Bronchiolitis hospitalization, younger chronologic age, prematurity, and RSV season were associated with RSV testing in a multivariate model controlling for other variables, with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 28.55 (95% CI, 2.24-2.74) for RSV season (December-March). Among hospitalized infants who were tested and had a diagnostic code suggesting treatment with antibiotics, use of antibiotics was significantly lower among those with a positive RSV test (63.4%) than those with a negative RSV (chi(2) test; P < children with bronchiolitis EOCs were tested for RSV; of those tested, about half were positive. In this integrated health care system, hospitalization with bronchiolitis, chronologic age, gestational age <37 weeks, neonatal oxygen exposure, and bronchiolitis EOC during the RSV season were the factors associated with testing visits in high-deductible health plans OBJECTIVE: To examine how enrollment in high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) affects use of well-child visits relative to traditional plans, when preventive care is exempt from the deductible. STUDY DESIGN: Pre-post comparison between groups. METHODS: We selected children aged <18 years enrolled in a large Massachusetts health plan through employers offering only 1 type of plan. Children were in traditional plans for a 12-month baseline period between 2001 and 2004, then were either switched by a decision of the parent's employer to an HDHP or kept in the traditional plan (controls) for a 12-month follow-up period. Preventive and other office visits were exempt from the deductible and subject to copayments, as in traditional plans. The primary outcome was whether the child received well-child visits recommended for the 12-month period. Using generalized linear mixed models, we compared the change in receipt of recommended well-child visits between baseline and follow-up for the HDHP group relative to controls. RESULTS: We identified 1598 children who were switched to HDHPs and 10,093 controls. Between baseline and follow-up, the mean proportion of recommended well-child visits received by HDHP children decreased slightly from 0.846 to 0.841, and from 0.861 to 0.855 for controls. In adjusted models, there was no significant difference in the change in probability that recommended well-child visits were received by HDHP children compared with controls (P = .69). CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of recommended well-child visits did not change for children switching from traditional plans to HDHPs that exempt preventive care from the Am J Manag Care. 2010 Nov;16(11):833-40. Interpreting complete blood counts soon after birth in newborns at risk for sepsis BACKGROUND: A complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell differential is commonly ordered to evaluate newborns at risk for sepsis. OBJECTIVES: To quantify how well components of the CBC predict sepsis in the first 72 hours after birth. METHODS: For this retrospective cross-sectional study we identified 67 623 term and late-preterm (>/= 34 weeks gestation) newborns from 12 northern California Kaiser hospitals and 1 Boston, Massachusetts hospital who had a CBC and blood culture within 1 hour of each other at <72 hours of age. We compared CBC results among newborns whose blood cultures were and were not positive and quantified discrimination by using receiver operating characteristic curves and likelihood ratios. RESULTS: Blood cultures of 245 infants (3.6 of 1000 tested newborns) were positive. Mean white blood cell (WBC) counts and mean absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) were lower, and mean proportions of immature neutrophils were higher in newborns with infection; platelet counts did not differ. Discrimination improved with age in the first few hours, especially for WBC counts and ANCs (eg, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for WBC counts was 0.52 at <1 hour and 0.87 at >/= 4 hours). Both WBC counts and ANCs were most informative when very low (eg, the likelihood ratio for ANC < 1000 was 115 at >/= 4 hours). No test was very sensitive; the lowest likelihood ratio (for WBC count >/= 20 000 at >/= 4 hours) was 0.16. CONCLUSION: Optimal interpretation of the CBC requires using interval likelihood ratios for the newborn's age in hours. Authors: Epub 2010 Oct 25. Adherence to cardiovascular disease race/ethnicity and language concordance may improve medication adherence and reduce disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) by fostering trust and improved patient-physician communication. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of patient race/ethnicity and language and patient-physician race/ethnicity and language concordance on medication adherence rates for a large cohort of diabetes patients in an integrated delivery system. DESIGN: We studied 131,277 adult diabetes patients in Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2005. Probit models assessed the effect of patient and physician race/ethnicity and language on adherence to CVD medications, after controlling for patient and physician characteristics. RESULTS: Ten percent of African American, 11 % of Hispanic, 63% of Asian, and 47% of white patients had same race/ethnicity physicians. 24% of Spanish-speaking patients were linguistically concordant with their physicians. African American (46%), Hispanic (49%) and Asian (52%) patients were significantly less likely than white patients (58%) to be in good adherence to all of their CVD medications (p<0.001). Spanish-speaking patients were less likely than English speaking patients to be in good adherence (51% versus 57%, p<0.001). Race concordance for African American patients was associated with adherence to all their CVD medications (53% vs. 50%, p<0.05). Language concordance was associated with medication adherence for Spanish-speaking patients (51% vs. 45%, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Increasing opportunities for patient-physician race/ethnicity and language concordance may improve medication adherence for African American and Spanish-speaking patients, though a similar effect was not observed for Asian patients or English-proficient 2010 Nov;25(11):1172-7.

Prevalence of colorectal cancer surveillance for ulcerative colitis in an integrated health care delivery system BACKGROUND & AIMS: The absence of grade A supporting evidence for surveillance colonoscopy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) has led to controversy regarding its benefit, yet it is routinely recommended in practice guidelines. Limited data are available on rates of colonoscopy surveillance and factors associated with surveillance. METHODS: A retrospective study of UC patients receiving care between 2006 and 2007 with >/= 8 years history of UC was conducted. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients who underwent surveillance during this 2-year study period. Sociodemographic and disease factors were identified a priori from variables recorded electronically in the medical record; multivariable associations with surveillance were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 771 patients with >/= 8 years history of UC, 24.6% of patients underwent at least 1 surveillance colonoscopy within the 2-year study period, with a maximum of 38.5% observed among patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. In a multivariable analysis, gender, age, race, and education were not associated with surveillance. Factors associated with increasing surveillance included lack of significant comorbidity (Charlson-Deyo index 0 vs 1+: odds ratio [OR], confidence interval: 1.1-2.5), (OR, Utilization of surveillance colonoscopy in a 2-year period was low, even among high-risk patients. Although specific factors recorded in computerized data were identified to be associated with surveillance, a greater understanding of how patients and physicians decide on surveillance is needed.

The impact of limited English proficiency and physician language concordance on reports of clinical interactions among patients with diabetes: the DISTANCE study OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of limited English proficiency (LEP) and physician language concordance with patient reports of clinical interactions. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 8638 Kaiser Permanente Northern California patients with diabetes. Patient responses were used to define English proficiency and physician language concordance. Quality of clinical interactions was based on 5 questions drawn from validated scales on communication, 2 on trust, and 3 on discrimination. RESULTS: Respondents included 8116 English-proficient and 522 LEP patients. Among LEP patients, 210 were language concordant and 153 were language discordant. In fully adjusted models, LEP patients were more likely than English-proficient patients to report suboptimal interactions on 3 out of 10 outcomes, including 1 communication and 2 discrimination items. In separate analyses, LEP-discordant patients were more likely than English-proficient patients to report suboptimal clinician-patient interactions on 7 out of 10 outcomes, including 2 communication, 2 trust, and 3 discrimination items. In contrast, LEP-concordant patients reported similar interactions to English-proficient patients. CONCLUSIONS: Reports of suboptimal interactions among patients with LEP were more common among those with language-discordant physicians. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Expanding access to language concordant physicians may improve clinical interactions among patients with LEP.

Recurrent wheezing in the third year of life among children born at 32 weeks' gestation or later: relationship to laboratory-confirmed, medically attended infection with respiratory syncytial virus during the first year of life OBJECTIVE: To quantify the relationship between recurrent wheezing (RW) in the third year of life and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, prematurity, and neonatal oxygen exposure. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study linking inpatient, outpatient, and laboratory databases for cohort assembly and logistic regression analysis. SETTING: Integrated health care delivery system in Northern California. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 71,102 children born from 1996 to 2002 at 32 weeks' gestational age or later who were health plan members for 9 or more months in their first and third years. MAIN EXPOSURES: Laboratory-confirmed, medically attended RSV infection during first year and supplemental oxygen during birth hospitalization. OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrent wheezing, quantified through outpatient visits, inpatient hospital stays, and asthma prescriptions. RESULTS: The rate of RW in the third year of life was 16.23% among premature infants with RSV and 6.22% among those without RSV. The risk of RW increased among infants who had an RSV outpatient encounter (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], CI, 2.01-5.82) compared with infants without RSV encounters. Gestational age of 34 to 36 weeks was associated with increased risk of RW (AOR, 1.23; 95% CI 1.07-1.41) compared with 38 to 40 weeks, while a gestational age of 41 weeks or more was protective (AOR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99). Supplemental oxygen exposure was associated with increased risk at all levels. CONCLUSION: Laboratory-confirmed, medically attended RSV infection, prematurity, and exposure to supplemental oxygen during the neonatal period have independent associations with the development of RW in the third year of life. Thiazolidinediones and fractures: evidence from translating research into action for diabetes BACKGROUND: Thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment has been associated with fractures. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between TZD treatment and fractures in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: Using data from Translating Research into Action for Diabetes, a multicenter prospective observational study of diabetes care in managed care, we conducted a matched case-control study to assess the odds of TZD exposure in patients with type 2 diabetes with and without fractures. We identified 786 cases based on fractures detected in health plan administrative data. Up to four controls without any fracture diagnoses were matched to each case. Controls were matched on health plan, date of birth within 5 yr, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index within 5 kg/m(2). We performed conditional logistic regression for premenopausal and postmenopausal women and men to assess the odds of exposure to potential risk factors for fracture, including medications, self-reported limited mobility, and lower-extremity amputations. RESULTS: We found statistically significant increased odds of exposure to TZDs, glucocorticoids, loop diuretics, and self-reported limited mobility for women 50 yr of age and older with fractures. Exposure to both loop diuretics and TZDs, glucocorticoids, and insulin and limited mobility and lower-extremity amputation were associated with fractures in men. CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal women taking TZDs and the subset of men taking both loop diuretics and TZDs were at increased risk for fractures. In postmenopausal women, risk was associated with higher TZD dose. No difference between rosiglitazone 2010 Oct;95(10):4560-5. Epub 2010 Jul 14. Length of stay and imminent discharge probability distributions from multistage models: variation by diagnosis, severity of illness, and hospital Multistage models have been effective at describing length of stay (LOS) distributions for diverse patient groups. Our study objective was to determine whether such models could be used for patient groups restricted by diagnosis, severity of illness, or hospital in order to facilitate comparisons conditioned on these factors. We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from 317,876 hospitalizations occurring over 2 years in 17 hospitals in a large, integrated health care delivery system. We estimated model parameters using data from the first year and validated them by comparing the predicted LOS distribution to the second year of data. We found that 3- and 4-stage models fit LOS data for either the entire hospital cohort or for subsets of patients with specific conditions (e.g. community-acquired pneumonia). Probability distributions were strongly influenced by the degree of physiologic derangement on admission, pre-existing comorbidities, or a summary mortality risk combining these with age, sex, and diagnosis. The distributions for groups with greater severity of illness were shifted slightly to the right, but even more notable was the increase in the dispersion, indicating the LOS is harder to predict with greater severity of illness. Multistage models facilitate computation of the hazard function, which shows the probability of imminent discharge given the elapsed LOS, and provide a unified method of fitting, summarizing, and studying the effects of factors affecting LOS distributions. Future work should not be restricted to expected LOS comparisons, but should incorporate examination of LOS probability distributions.

CONTEXT: Physicians have increasingly become the focus of clinical performance measurement.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between patient panel characteristics and relative physician clinical performance rankings within a large academic primary care network.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort study using data from 125,303 adult patients who had visited any of the 9 hospital-affiliated practices or 4 community health centers between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2005, (162 primary care physicians in 1 physician organization linked by a common electronic medical record system in Eastern Massachusetts) to determine changes in physician quality ranking based on an aggregate of Health Plan Employer and Data Information Set (HEDIS) measures after adjusting for practice site, visit frequency, and patient panel characteristics.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Composite physician clinical performance score based on 9 HEDIS quality measures (reported by percentile, with lower scores indicating higher quality).RESULTS: Patients of primary care physicians in the top quality performance tertile compared with patients of primary care physicians in the bottom quality tertile were older (51.1 years [95% confidence interval {CI}, vs 46.6 years [95% CI, 43.8-49.5 years], P < .001), had a (0.91 [95% CI, 0.83-0.98] vs 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66-0.95]; P = .008), and made more frequent primary care practice visits (71.0% [95% CI, 68.5%-73.5%] vs 61.8% [95% visits/year; P = .003). Top tertile primary care physicians compared with the bottom tertile physicians had fewer minority patients (13.7% [95% CI, 10.6%-16.7%] 25.6% 10.2% [95% CI, 5.5%-14.9%]; P <.001), and patients with Medicaid coverage or without insurance (9.6% [95% CI, 7.5%-11.7%] vs 17.2% [95% CI, 13.5%-21.0%]; P <.001). After accounting for practice site and visit frequency differences, adjusting for patient panel factors resulted in a relative mean change in physician rankings of 7.6 percentiles (95% CI, 6.6-8.7 percentiles) per primary care physician, with more than one-third (36%) of primary care physicians (59/162) reclassified into different quality tertiles.CONCLUSION: Among primary care physicians practicing within the same large academic primary care system, patient panels with greater proportions of underinsured, minority, and non-English-speaking patients were associated with lower quality rankings for primary care physicians.

Disposition index, glucose effectiveness, and conversion to type 2 diabetes: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) OBJECTIVE: Disposition index (DI) and glucose effectiveness (S(G)) are risk factors for diabetes. However, the effect of DI and S(G) on future diabetes has not been examined in large epidemiological studies using direct measures. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Insulin sensitivity index (S(I)), acute insulin response (AIR), and S(G) were measured in 826 participants (aged 40-69 years) in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. DI was expressed as S(I) x AIR. At the 5-year follow-up examination, 128 individuals (15.5%) had developed diabetes. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of a model with S(I) and AIR was similar to that of DI (0.767 vs. 0.774, P = 0.543). In a multivariate logistic regression model that included both DI and S(G), conversion to diabetes was predicted by both S(G) (odds ratio x 1 SD, 0.61 [0.47-0.80]) and DI (0.68 [0.54-0.85]) after adjusting for demographic variables, fasting and 2-h glucose concentrations, family history of diabetes, and measures of obesity. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, glucose tolerance status, obesity, and family history of diabetes did not have a significant modifying impact on the relation of S(G) and DI to incident diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The predictive power of DI is comparable to that of its components, S(I) and AIR. S(G) and DI independently predict conversion to diabetes similarly across race/ethnic groups, varying states of glucose tolerance, family history of diabetes, and obesity. Premature infants born to adolescent mothers: health care utilization after initial discharge OBJECTIVE: Premature infants have increased health care utilization after initial discharge compared with term infants. Young maternal age has been shown to impact health care utilization among term infants, but little is known about the impact of maternal age on health care utilization among premature infants. We compared health care utilization among premature infants of adolescent (aged < or = 19 years) and young adult (aged 20-29 years) mothers, hypothesizing that premature infants of adolescent mothers would have increased acute care utilization, while having decreased preventive care utilization. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed health care utilization of premature infants born to adolescent mothers (n = 76) compared with premature infants born to young adult mothers (n = 587) within a cohort of premature infants born between 1998 and 2001 in an integrated health care delivery system. RESULTS: After controlling for illness severity, premature infants born to adolescent mothers had significantly increased odds of medical rehospitalizations (odds ratio 3.57, 95% confidence interval, 1.81-7.05) and emergency department visits (odds ratio 3.67, 95% confidence interval, 2.11-6.39) during the first year after initial discharge compared with premature infants born to young adult mothers. Differences in rehospitalization rates were significant within the first 3 months after discharge (P < .001). Frequency of preventive care visits was not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar severity of chronic illness and similar preventive care utilization, premature infants born to adolescent mothers had significantly increased rates of rehospitalizations and emergency department visits compared with premature infants born to young adult mothers.

Hypoglycemia is more common among type 2 diabetes patients with limited health literacy: the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) BACKGROUND: Little is known about the frequency of significant hypoglycemic events in actual practice. Limited health literacy (HL) is common among patients with type 2 diabetes, may impede diabetes self-management, and thus HL could increase the risk of hypoglycemia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of ambulatory, pharmacologically-treated patients with type 2 diabetes reporting > or =1 significant hypoglycemic events in the prior 12 months, and evaluate whether HL is associated with hypoglycemia. RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis in an observational cohort, the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE). SUBJECTS: The subjects comprised 14,357 adults with pharmacologically-treated, type 2 diabetes who are seen at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a non-profit, integrated health care delivery system. MEASURES: Patient-reported frequency of significant hypoglycemia (losing consciousness or requiring outside assistance); patient-reported health literacy. RESULTS: At least one significant hypoglycemic episode in the prior 12 months was reported by 11% of patients, with the highest risk for those on insulin (59%). Patients commonly reported limited health literacy: 53% reported problems learning about health, 40% needed help reading health materials, and 32% were not confident filling out medical forms by themselves. After adjustment, problems learning (OR 1.4, CI 1.1-1.7), needing help reading (OR 1.3, CI 1.1-1.6), and lack of confidence with forms (OR 1.3, CI 1.1-1.6) were independently associated with significant hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Significant hypoglycemia was a frequent complication in this cohort of type 2 diabetes patients using anti-hyperglycemic therapies; those reporting limited HL were especially vulnerable. Efforts to reduce hypoglycemia and promote patient safety may require self-management support that is appropriate for those with limited HL, and consider more vigilant surveillance, conservative glycemic targets or avoidance of the most Intern Med. 2010 Sep;25(9):962-8.

A1C between 5.7 and 6.4% as a marker for identifying pre-diabetes, insulin sensitivity and secretion, and cardiovascular risk factors: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) OBJECTIVE: A1C is an optional method for diagnosing diabetes and also for detecting individuals at increased risk of the disease. However, how A1C compares with fasting (FPG) and 2-h plasma glucose for detecting at-risk individuals is not well known. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 2-h glucose tolerance test, frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, and A1C were obtained at the follow-up examination in 855 participants in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS). For this report, 385 individuals were at increased risk of diabetes as defined by A1C between 5.7 and 6.4%, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and/or impaired fasting glucose (IFG). RESULTS: IFG and IGT identified 69.1 and 59.5% of all individuals at increased risk of diabetes, respectively. A1C 5.7-6.4% detected 23.6% of all at-risk individuals, although more African Americans (31.4%) and Hispanics (35.2%) than non-Hispanic whites (9.9%). Relative to A1C, FPG was more strongly related to fasting insulin (r = 0.38 vs. 0.26; P < 0.01), acute insulin response (r = - 0.20 vs. - 0.09; P < 0.01), and waist circumference (r = 0.43 vs. 0.25; P < 0.001) by the Spearman correlation test. Similarly, 2-h plasma glucose was more strongly related to Si (r = - 0.40 vs. - 0.27; P < 0.01) and triglycerides (r = 0.30 vs. 0.08; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A1C 5.7-6.4% is sensitive for detecting at-risk individuals than IFG and IGT, particularly among non-Hispanic whites. Single determinations of FPG and 2-h plasma glucose seem to be more precise correlates of insulin resistance and secretion than A1C and, in general, better for 2010 Jun 23. Relationship between urine bisphenol-A level and declining male sexual function The adverse effect of bisphenol-A (BPA) on the male reproductive system observed in animal studies has not been well examined in human populations. BPA is potentially a serious public health problem because of its widely detected presence in the human body. This study was conducted among 427 male workers in regions where high levels of BPA exposure existed. All participants provided urine samples, which were tested for BPA concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. Male sexual dysfunction was ascertained using standard male sexual function inventories. Male sexual dysfunction was measured in 4 domains using 7 indices. After controlling for potential confounders using linear regression, increasing urine BPA level was associated with worsening male sexual function on a continuous scale. All 7 indices demonstrated this negative linear correlation. Increasing urine BPA level was associated with decreased sexual desire (P < .001), more difficulty having an erection (P < .001), lower ejaculation strength (P < .001), and lower level of overall satisfaction with sex life (P < .01). A similar negative correlation was also observed among participants exposed to BPA from only environmental sources (no occupational exposure to BPA), although the estimates in this group were less stable because of a smaller sample size. Our results reveal a correlation between a biological measure of urine BPA level and declining male sexual function. This finding may enhance the understanding of the BPA effect in human populations, and may have important public health implications given the widespread human exposure to BPA.

Incidence, prevalence, and time trends of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease in Northern California, 1996 to 2006 OBJECTIVE: To examine the incidence and prevalence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during 1996-2006 in a community-based health-care delivery system. STUDY DESIGN: Members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California aged 0 to 17 years with IBD were identified by use of computerized medical information with confirmation obtained through review of the medical record. RESULTS: The average annual incidence of IBD per 100000 was 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-3.1) for Crohn's disease (CD) and 3.2 (CI, 2.8-3.6) for ulcerative colitis (UC). During the 11-year study period, the annual incidence per 100000 increased from 2.2 to 4.3 for CD (P = .09) and from 1.8 to 4.9 for UC (P < .001). The ratio of incident CD cases to incident UC cases was 0.9 in non-Hispanic whites, 1.6 in African Americans (P = .12), 0.3 in Hispanics (P < .001) and 0.4 in Asians (P = .04). The average length of enrollment during the 11-year study period exceeded 8 years. The point prevalence on December 31, 2006, per 100000 was 12.0 for CD (CI, 9.6-14.4) and 19.5 (CI, 16.5-22.6) for UC. CONCLUSIONS: In this population the incidence of UC increased significantly by 2.7-fold and CD increased 2.0-fold without reaching statistical significance. Hispanic and Asian children had development of UC more often than CD, suggesting possible etiologic differences across racial and ethnic Epub 2010 Apr 18. Length of stay predictions: improvements through the use of automated laboratory and comorbidity variables BACKGROUND: Length of stay (LOS) is a common measure of hospital resource utilization. Most methods for risk-adjusting LOS are limited by the use of only administrative data. Recent studies suggest that adding automated clinical data to these models improves performance. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of adding 'point of admission' automated laboratory and comorbidity measures-the Laboratory Acute Physiology Score (LAPS) and Comorbidity Point Score (COPS)-to risk adjustment models that are based on administrative data. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 155,474 hospitalizations between 2002 and 2005 at 17 Northern California Kaiser Permanente hospitals. We evaluated the benefit of adding LAPS and COPS in linear regression models using full, trimmed, truncated, and log-transformed LOS, as well as in logistic and generalized linear models. RESULTS: Mean age was 61 +/- 19 years; females represented 55.2% of subjects. The mean LOS was 4.5 +/- 7.7 days; median LOS was 2.8 days (interquartile range, 1.3-5.1 days). Adding LAPS and COPS to the linear regression model improved R by 29% from 0.113 to 0.146. Similar improvements with the inclusion of LAPS and COPS were observed in other regression models. Together, these variables were responsible for >50% of the predictive ability of logistic regression models that identified outliers with longer LOS. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of automated laboratory and comorbidity data improved LOS predictions in all models, underscoring the need for more widespread adoption of comprehensive electronic medical records.

Thiazolidinediones, cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality: translating research into action for diabetes (TRIAD) BACKGROUND: Studies have associated thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and questioned whether the two available TZDs, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have different CVD risks. We compared CVD incidence, cardiovascular (CV), and all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetic patients treated with rosiglitazone or pioglitazone as their only TZD. METHODS: We analyzed survey, medical record, administrative, and National Death Index (NDI) data from 1999 through 2003 from Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD), a prospective observational study of diabetes care in managed care. Medications, CV procedures, and CVD were determined from health plan (HP) administrative data, and mortality was from NDI. Adjusted hazard rates (AHR) were derived from Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, history of diabetic nephropathy, history of CVD, insulin use, and HP. RESULTS: Across TRIAD's 10 HPs, patients (24%) for only rosiglitazone, 711 (10%) for only pioglitazone, and 331 (4%) for multiple TZDs. In the seven HPs using both TZDs, 1,159 patients (33%) filled a prescription a TZD, (16%) for only rosiglitazone, 334 (10%) for only and 261 (7%) for multiple TZDs. For all CV events, CV, and all-cause mortality, we found no significant difference between rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. CONCLUSIONS: In this relatively small, prospective, observational study, we found no statistically significant differences in CV outcomes for rosiglitazone- compared to pioglitazone-treated patients. There does not appear to be a pattern of clinically meaningful differences in CV outcomes for rosiglitazone- propensity score-based pooling of multiple databases applied to a study of biologics INTRODUCTION: A large study on the safety of biologics required pooling of data from multiple data sources, but while extensive confounder adjustment was necessary, private, individual-level covariate information could not be shared. OBJECTIVES: To describe the methods of pooling data that investigators considered, and to detail the strengths and limitations of the chosen method: a propensity score (PS)-based approach that allowed for full multivariate adjustment without compromising patient privacy. RESEARCH DESIGN: The project had a central data coordinating center responsible for collection and analysis of data. Private data could not be transmitted to the data coordinating center. Investigators assessed 4 methods for pooled analyses: full covariate sharing, cell-aggregated sharing, meta-analysis, and the PS-based method. We evaluated each method for protection of private information, analytic integrity and flexibility, and ability to meet the study's operational and statistical needs. RESULTS: Analysis of 4 example datasets yielded substantially similar estimates if data were pooled with a PS versus individual covariates (0%-3% difference in point estimates). Several practical challenges arose. (1) PSs are best suited for dichotomous exposures but 6 or more exposure categories were desired; we chose a series of exposure contrasts with a common referent group. (2) Subgroup analyses had to be specified a priori. (3) Time-varying exposures and confounders required appropriate analytic handling including re-estimation of PSs. (4) Detection of heterogeneity among centers was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: The PS-based pooling method offered strong protection of patient privacy and a reasonable balance between analytic integrity and flexibility of study execution. We would recommend its use in other studies that require pooling of databases, multivariate adjustment, and privacy predictors of patient-physician race and ethnic concordance: a medical facility fixed-effects approach OBJECTIVE: To examine the predictors of patient-physician race/ethnicity concordance among diabetes patients in an integrated delivery system. DATA SOURCE: Kaiser Permanente's Northern California Diabetes Registry of 2005. STUDY DESIGN: Logistic regression predicted concordance for each racial/ethnic group. Availability of a concordant physician, whether a patient chose their physician, and patient language were main explanatory variables. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: The study population consisted of 109,745 patients and 1,750 physicians. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients who chose their physicians were more likely to have a same race/ethnicity physician with OR of 2.2 (95 percent CI 1.74-2.82) for African American patients, 1.71 (95 percent CI 1.44-2.04) for Hispanic patients, 1.11 (95 percent CI 1.04-1.18) for white patients, and 1.38 (95 percent CI 1.23, 1.55) for Asian patients. Availability of a same race/ethnicity physician was also a predictor of concordance for African American patients (OR 2.7; 95 percent CI 2.45-2.98) and marginally significant for Hispanic patients (OR 1.02; 95 percent CI 1.01-1.02), white patients (OR 1.02; 95 percent CI 1.00-1.04), and Asian patients (OR 1.05; 95 percent CI 1.03, 1.07). Limited English language was a strong predictor of concordance for Hispanic patients (OR 4.81; 95 percent CI 4.2-5.51) and Asian patients (OR 9.8; 95 percent CI 7.7, 12.6). CONCLUSION: Patient language, preferences, and the racial composition of the physician workforce Epub 2010 Mar 10. Developing a policy-relevant research agenda for the patient-centered medical home: a focus on outcomes BACKGROUND: The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) is a widely endorsed model of delivery system reform that emphasizes primary care. Pilot demonstration projects are underway in many states, sponsored by Medicare, Medicaid, major health plans and multi-payer coalitions. METHODS: In this paper we consider the development of a long-term policy-relevant research agenda on outcomes of the PCMH. We provide an overview of potential measures of PCMH impact, identify measurement challenges and recommend areas for further study. Although the PCMH should not be expected to solve every problem in the health care system, developing a research agenda for measuring outcomes of delivery system innovations such as the PCMH should be considered in the context of the larger effort to improve the US health care system, with the ultimate goal to improve population health. RESULTS: As a framework for our discussion, we have chosen the Institute of Medicine's six specific aims for 21st century health care: (1) safe, (2) effective, (3) patient-centered, (4) timely, (5) efficient and (6) equitable. In addition, we include potential areas of PCMH outcomes that do not easily fall under this framework and consider unintended consequences. CONCLUSION: Multi-stakeholder involvement will be essential in developing a long-term policy-relevant research agenda for outcomes of the PCMH.

Entering and exiting the Medicare part D coverage gap: role of comorbidities and demographics BACKGROUND: Some Medicare Part D enrollees whose drug expenditures exceed a threshold enter a coverage gap with full cost-sharing, increasing their risk for reduced adherence and adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine comorbidities and demographic characteristics associated with gap entry and exit. DESIGN: We linked 2005-2006 pharmacy, outpatient, and inpatient claims to enrollment and Census data. We used logistic regression to estimate associations of 2006 gap entry and exit with 2005 medical comorbidities, demographics, and Census block characteristics. We expressed all results as predicted percentages. PATIENTS: 287,713 patients without gap coverage, continuously enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Part D (MAPD) plan serving eight states. Patients who received a low-income subsidy, could not be geocoded, or had no 2006 drug fills were excluded. RESULTS: Of enrollees, 15.9% entered the gap, 2.6% within the first 180 days; among gap enterers, only 6.7% exited again. Gap entry was significantly associated with female gender and all comorbidities, particularly dementia (39.5% gap entry rate) and diabetes (28.0%). Among dementia patients entering the gap, anti-dementia drugs together for 40% of pre-gap expenditures. Among diabetic patients, rosiglitazone accounted for 7.2% of pre-gap expenditures. Having dementia was associated with twice the risk of gap exit. CONCLUSIONS: Certain chronically ill MAPD enrollees are at high risk of gap entry and exposure to unsubsidized medication costs. Clinically vulnerable populations should be counseled on how to best manage costs through drug substitution or discontinuation of specific, non-essential medications.

Social disparities in dental insurance and annual dental visits among medically insured patients with diabetes: the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) Survey INTRODUCTION: People with diabetes are at increased risk of periodontal disease and tooth loss. Healthy People 2010 set a goal that 71% or more of people with diabetes should have an annual dental exam. METHODS: We assessed dental insurance and annual dental visits among dentate respondents from the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) Survey cohort (N = 20,188), an ethnically stratified, random sample of patients with diabetes aged 30 to 75 years receiving medical care from Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We calculated predicted probabilities for an annual dental visit (PPADV) by using regression models that incorporated age, sex, education level, annual household income, and self-reported race/ethnicity, stratified by whether the respondent had dental insurance. RESULTS: Among 12,405 dentate patients, 9,257 (75%) had dental insurance. Annual dental visits were reported by 7,557 (82%) patients with dental insurance and 1,935 (61%) patients without dental insurance. The age-sex adjusted odds ratio for an annual dental visit was 2.66 (95% confidence interval, 2.33-3.03) for patients with dental insurance compared to those without dental insurance. For patients with dental insurance, the PPADV was 71% or more for all except those with the lowest household income. In contrast, for those without dental insurance, the PPADV was less than 71% for all except those with the most education or the highest income. We found some racial/ethnic subgroups were more likely than others to take advantage of dental insurance to have an annual dental visit. CONCLUSION: Patients with diabetes in this managed care population who lacked dental insurance failed to meet the Healthy People 2010 goal for an annual dental visit. An increased effort should be made to promote oral health among people with diabetes. Authors: May;7(3):A57. Epub 2010 May 15. Generic-only drug coverage in the Medicare Part D gap and effect on medication cost-cutting behaviors for patients with diabetes mellitus: the translating research into action for diabetes study OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between drug coverage during the Medicare Part D coverage gap and medication cost-cutting behaviors of beneficiaries with diabetes mellitus who use and do not use insulin. DESIGN: The study was cross-sectional. SETTING: A network-model health system. PARTICIPANTS: 2007 survey of Medicare Advantage Part D (MAPD) and Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) beneficiaries who entered the gap by October 2006 (N=1,468, 57% response rate). MEASUREMENTS: The primary predictor variable was no gap coverage versus generic-only gap coverage. Seven cost-cutting behaviors were examined as dependent variables, including cost-related nonadherence (CRN) to any medication. Covariates included race or ethnicity, education, health status, income, and comorbidities, as well as generic medication use in the first quarter. Logistic regression models were constructed using nonresponse weights to generate predicted percentages. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, beneficiaries taking insulin were less likely to report CRN if they had generic-only gap coverage than if they had no gap coverage (16% vs 29%, P=.03). No differences in CRN according to type of gap coverage were seen between beneficiaries not taking insulin. CONCLUSION: Medicare beneficiaries using insulin are at high risk of CRN. Generic-only coverage during the gap is associated with an attenuated risk of CRN in insulin users, possibly because of savings on other, generic medications. Future research should evaluate CRN within alternative benefit designs covering selected brand name medications, such as insulin, during the gap. Authors: Geriatr Soc. 2010 May;58(5):822-8.

Effect of choice of estimation method on inter-hospital mortality rate comparisons OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the use of 6 different methods for calculating expected mortality rates and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) when performing interhospital mortality rate comparisons. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using actual and simulated hospitalization data to evaluate the use of (1) fixed-effects, (2) Generalized Linear Mixed Model, and (3) Bayesian (Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based) random-effects models on both aggregated and individual-level data to estimate SMRs by hospital. SETTING: Seventeen hospitals in a large integrated health care delivery system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Inpatient mortality. RESULTS: Results from the 6 different methods compared in this study were highly correlated both on log(SMR) values and hospital ranks (range, 0.91-1). All the methods had high specificity (>87%) for finding true underlying mortality effects. The fixed-effects models had higher overall sensitivity than the random-effects models. The individual-level random effects model had generally higher sensitivity than the aggregated random-effects models. All methods showed a high correlation with the true ranks. DISCUSSION: When comparing mortality rates across hospitals, it is important to focus not only on the method used to measure patient sickness but also on the analytical technique used to estimate hospital-specific adjusted mortality rates. When an illness severity measure including detailed physiologic data was used, the simplest method we examined, a fixed-effects aggregate-level approach in common usage, out-performed the other methods when both specificity and sensitivity are considered. Use of a severity measure that correlates less well with mortality than the one we employed would be expected to reduce the sensitivity of all of the methods examined.

System-based participatory research in health care: an approach for sustainable translational research and quality improvement Translational research seeks to improve health care by promoting action and change in real-world health care settings. Although translational research advocates a break from the traditional researcher-initiated approach to science, strategies to successfully engage clinicians and leaders of health care delivery organizations in research are still under development. We propose that applying the principles of community-based participatory research in a way that considers delivery systems-including their leaders, clinicians, and staff-as a focal community can enhance the ability of translational research to improve health care. Applying participatory research methods, such as engaging in collaborative partnerships, building on existing community strengths, investing in long-term relationships, and engaging in research as a cyclical, iterative process, can be a successful approach to sustainable quality improvement at the systems level. Authors: Schmittdiel social support, and associations with diabetes self-care and clinical outcomes in NHANES PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate how social support and race/ethnicity were associated with diabetes self-care behaviors and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Using the cross-sectional 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the authors examined white, black, and Latino respondents who self-reported a diabetes diagnosis (n = 450), estimating the associations of social support on diabetes outcomes. The primary exposure was a social support index (0-5), which assessed the number of sources of support in one's life. Outcomes were self-care behaviors (controlling weight, exercising, controlling fat/caloric intake, checking feet, and self-monitoring blood glucose) and intermediate clinical outcomes (hemoglobin A1C, diastolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein [LDL]). RESULTS: There were no differences in social support by race/ethnicity. The authors observed several significant race/ethnicity by social support interactions in adjusted models, controlling for age, gender, education, self-reported health, depression, functional disability, insurance status, and insulin use. Among blacks, social support was associated with controlling weight (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55, P = .03), exercising (OR = 1.38, P = .03), controlling fat/calories (OR = 1.84, P = .03), and lower diastolic blood pressure (beta = -3.07, P = .02). Among whites, social support was associated with lower LDL (beta = -9.45, P = .01). No significant effects were noted for Latinos. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship of social support with diabetes management differed by race/ethnicity, with the strongest findings among blacks. Social support may be influential for maintaining self-care behaviors among blacks and controlling lipid levels among whites. Authors: Rees CA; Karter AJ; Young BA Diabetes Educ. Epub 2010 Mar 23. Maternal and paternal race/ethnicity are both associated with gestational diabetes OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the rates of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) associated with both maternal and paternal race/ethnicity. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of all women delivered within a managed care network. Rates of GDM were calculated for maternal, paternal, and combined race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Among the 139,848 women with identified race/ethnicity, Asians had the highest rate (P < .001) of GDM (6.8%) as compared with whites (3.4%), African Americans (3.2%), and Hispanics (4.9%). When examining race/ethnicity controlling for potential confounders, we found that the rates of GDM were higher among Asian (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.5; confidence and Hispanic (aOR, 1.3; 95% 1.2-1.4) men as compared with their white counterparts. CONCLUSION: We found that rates of GDM are affected by both maternal and paternal race/ethnicity. In both Asians and Hispanics, maternal and paternal race are equally associated with an increase in GDM. These differences may inform further investigation of the 2010 Jun;202(6):616.e1-5.

Impact of two Medicaid prior-authorization policies on antihypertensive use and costs among Michigan and Indiana residents dually enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare: results of a longitudinal, population-based study BACKGROUND: In response to rising pharmaceutical costs, many state Medicaid programs have implemented policies requiring prior authorization for high-cost medications, even for established users. However, little is known about the impact of these policies on the use of antihypertensive medicines in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this longitudinal, population-based study was to assess comprehensive prior-authorization programs for antihypertensives on drug use and costs in a vulnerable Medicaid population in Michigan and Indiana. METHODS: A prior-authorization policy for antihypertensives was implemented in Michigan in March 2002 and in Indiana in September 2002; Indiana also implemented an antihypertensive stepwise-therapy requirement in July 2003. Our study cohort included individuals aged >or=18 years in Michigan and Indiana who were continuously enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare from July 2000 through September 2003. Claims data were obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We included all antihypertensive medications, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, II receptor blockers. We used interrupted time-series analysis to study policy-related changes in the total number and cost of antihypertensive prescriptions. RESULTS: Overall, 38,684 enrollees in Michigan and 29,463 in Indiana met our inclusion criteria. Slightly more than half of our cohort in both states was female (53.29%in Michigan and 56.32%in Indiana). In Michigan, 20.23% of patients were aged >or=65 years; 77.44% were white, 20.11% were black, and the remainder were Hispanic, Native American, Asian, or of other or unknown race. In Indiana, 20.07% were aged >or=65 years; 84.93% were white, 13.64% were black, and the remainder were Hispanic, Native American, Asian, or of other or unknown race. The implementation of both policies was associated with large and immediate reductions in the use of nonpreferred medications: 83.33% reduction in the use of such drugs in Michigan (-84.30 prescriptions per 1000 enrollees per month; P < 0.001) and 35.76% in Indiana (-64.45 prescriptions per 1000 enrollees per month; P < 0.001). As expected, use of preferred medications also increased substantially in both states (P < 0.001). Overall, antihypertensive therapy immediately dropped 0.16% in Michigan (P = 0.04) and 1.82% in Indiana (P = 0.02). Implementation of the policies was also associated with reductions in pharmacy reimbursement of $616,572.43 in Michigan and $868,265.97 in Indiana in the first postpolicy year. CONCLUSIONS: Prior authorization was associated with lower use of nonpreferred antihypertensive drugs that was largely offset by increases in the use of preferred drugs. The possible clinical consequences of policy-induced drug switching for individual patients remain unknown because the present study did not include access to medical record data. Further research is needed to establish whether large-scale switches in medicines following the inception of prior-authorization policies have any long-term health effects.

Barriers to insulin initiation: the translating research into action for diabetes insulin starts project OBJECTIVE: Reasons for failing to initiate prescribed insulin (primary nonadherence) are poorly understood. We investigated barriers to insulin initiation following a new prescription. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We surveyed insulin-naive patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, already treated with two or more oral agents who were recently prescribed insulin. We compared responses for respondents prescribed, but never initiating, insulin (n = 69) with those dispensed insulin (n = 100). RESULTS: Subjects failing to initiate prescribed insulin commonly reported misconceptions regarding insulin risk (35% believed that insulin causes blindness, renal failure, amputations, heart attacks, strokes, or early death), plans to instead work harder on behavioral goals, sense of personal failure, low self-efficacy, injection phobia, hypoglycemia concerns, negative impact on social life and job, inadequate health literacy, health care provider inadequately explaining risks/benefits, and limited insulin self-management training. CONCLUSIONS: Primary adherence for insulin may be improved through better provider communication regarding risks, shared decision making, and insulin 19. Effect of neonatal jaundice and phototherapy on the frequency of first-year outpatient visits OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether either hyperbilirubinemia or inpatient phototherapy is associated with increased subsequent outpatient visit rates, a possible effect of the 'vulnerable child syndrome.' METHODS: We compared 3 groups of otherwise well term and late-preterm infants who were born between 1995 and 2004 in Northern California Kaiser hospitals: group 1 never had a documented total serum bilirubin (TSB) level > or =12 mg/dL (n = 128 417); group 2 had a TSB level > or =17 and <23 mg/dL as outpatients between 48 hours and 7 days of age and did not receive inpatient phototherapy (n = 6777); and group 3 met criteria for group 2 but did receive inpatient phototherapy (n = 1765). We compared outpatient visit rates from 15 to 364 days of age adjusting for other predictors of visit rates by using Poisson and linear regression. RESULTS: The mean total number of visits between 15 and 364 days was 9.83. Compared with group 1, adjusted total first-year visit rates were slightly increased in group 2 (adjusted incidence rate ratio: 1.04 [95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.05]) and group 3 (incidence rate ratio: 1.07 [95% confidence interval: 1.05-1.10]). The increases in visit rates were greatest for visits from 15 to 59 days of age, for specialty visits, and for unspecified diagnoses. These rates correspond to adjusted increases in total first-year visits (compared with group 1) of 0.36 visits in group 2 and 0.73 visits in group 3. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal jaundice and inpatient phototherapy are associated with only small increases in first-year outpatient visit rates, consistent with mild or infrequent contribution to the vulnerable child syndrome in this population.

Falling into the coverage gap: Part D drug costs and adherence for Medicare Advantage prescription drug plan beneficiaries with diabetes OBJECTIVE: To compare drug costs and adherence among Medicare beneficiaries with the standard Part D coverage gap versus supplemental gap coverage in 2006. DATA SOURCES: Pharmacy data from Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) plans. STUDY DESIGN: Parallel analyses comparing beneficiaries aged 65+ with diabetes in an integrated MAPD with a gap versus no gap (n=28,780); and in a network-model MAPD with a gap versus generic-only coverage during the gap (n=14,984). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Drug spending was 3 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 1-4 percent) and 4 percent (CI: 1-6 percent) lower among beneficiaries with a gap versus full or generic-only gap coverage, respectively. Out-of-pocket expenditures were 189 percent higher (CI: 185-193 percent) and adherence to three chronic drug classes was lower among those with a gap versus no gap (e.g., odds ratio=0.83, CI: 0.79-0.88, for oral diabetes drugs). Annual out-of-pocket spending was 14 percent higher (CI: 10-17 percent) for beneficiaries with a gap versus generic-only gap coverage, but levels of adherence were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Among Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes, having the Part D coverage gap resulted in lower total drug costs, but higher out-of-pocket spending and worse adherence compared with having no gap. Having generic-only coverage during the gap appeared to confer limited benefits compared with having no gap coverage. Authors: Fung Dec 30. Patient race/ethnicity and patient-physician race/ethnicity concordance in the management of cardiovascular disease risk factors for patients with diabetes OBJECTIVE Patient-physician race/ethnicity concordance can improve care for minority patients. However, its effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) care and prevention is unknown. We examined associations of patient race/ethnicity and patient-physician race/ethnicity concordance on CVD risk factor levels and appropriate modification of treatment in response to high risk factor values (treatment intensification) in a large cohort of diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The study population included 108,555 adult diabetic patients in Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2005. Probit models assessed the effect of patient race/ethnicity on risk factor control and treatment intensification after adjusting for patient and physician-level characteristics. RESULTS African American patients were less likely than whites to have A1C <8.0% (64 vs. 69%, P < 0.0001), LDL cholesterol mg/dl (40 vs. (SBP) <140 mmHg (70 vs. 78%, P < 0.0001). Hispanic patients were less likely than whites to have A1C <8% (62 vs. 69%, P < 0.0001). African American patients were less likely than whites to have A1C treatment intensification (73 vs. 77%, P < 0.0001; odds ratio [OR] 0.8 [95% CI 0.7-0.9]) but more likely to receive treatment intensification for SBP (78 vs. 71%, P < 0.0001; 1.5 [1.3-1.7]). Hispanic patients were more likely to have LDL cholesterol treatment intensification (47 vs. 45%, P < 0.05; 1.1 [1.0-1.2]). Patient-physician race/ethnicity concordance was not significantly associated with risk factor control or treatment intensification.

Physicians' perceptions of barriers to cardiovascular disease risk factor control among patients with diabetes: results from the translating research into action for diabetes (TRIAD) study INTRODUCTION: Many patients with diabetes have poorly controlled blood glucose, lipid, or blood pressure levels, increasing their risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other complications. Relatively little is known about what physicians perceive to be barriers to good CVD risk factor control or their own role in helping patients achieve good control. METHODS: We interviewed 34 primary care physicians in 4 states to assess their perceptions of patients' barriers to CVD risk factor control. Interviews were coded and analyzed for emergent themes. RESULTS: Physicians attributed barriers primarily to patients (socioeconomic issues, competing medical conditions, and lack of motivation) or to health system barriers (cost of care or lack of a multidisciplinary team). Physicians also expressed high levels of frustration with their efforts to address barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians felt that barriers to CVD risk factor control often were beyond their abilities to address. Training physicians or other members of the primary health care team to address patients' personal barriers and health system barriers to good control could help alleviate high frustration levels, improve relationships with patients, and improve the treatment of diabetes. Supporting such efforts with adequate reimbursement should be a focus of health care Board Fam Med. 2010 Mar-Apr;23(2):171-8. Intra-hospital transfers to a higher level of care: contribution to total hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and length of stay (LOS) BACKGROUND: Patients who experience intra-hospital transfers to a higher level of care (eg, ward to intensive care unit [ICU]) are known to have high mortality. However, these findings have been based on single-center studies or studies that employ ICU admissions as the denominator. OBJECTIVE: To employ automated bed history data to examine outcomes of intra-hospital transfers using all hospital admissions as the denominator. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A total of 19 acute care hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 150,495 patients, who experienced 210,470 hospitalizations, admitted to these hospitals between November 1st, 2006 and January 31st, 2008. MEASUREMENTS: Predictors were age, sex, admission type, admission diagnosis, physiologic derangement on admission, and pre-existing illness burden; outcomes were: 1) occurrence of intra-hospital transfer, 2) death following admission to the hospital, 3) death following transfer, and 4) total hospital length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: A total of 7,868 hospitalizations that began with admission to either a general medical surgical ward or to a transitional care unit (TCU) had at least one transfer to a higher level of care. These hospitalizations constituted only 3.7% of all admissions, but accounted for 24.2% of all ICU admissions, 21.7% of all hospital deaths, and 13.2% of all hospital days. Models based on age, sex, preadmission laboratory test results, and comorbidities did not predict the occurrence of these transfers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients transferred to higher level of care following admission to the hospital have excess mortality and LOS. Authors: Escobar GJ; Greene JD; Med. 2011 Feb;6(2):74-80.

Early and late complications among long-term colorectal cancer survivors with ostomy or anastomosis PURPOSE: Among long-term (>or=5 y) colorectal cancer survivors with permanent ostomy or anastomosis, we compared the incidence of medical and surgical complications and examined the relationship of complications with health-related quality of life. BACKGROUND: The incidence and effects of complications on long-term health-related quality of life among colorectal cancer survivors are not adequately understood. METHODS: Participants (284 survivors with ostomies and 395 survivors with anastomoses) were long-term colorectal cancer survivors enrolled in an integrated health plan. Health-related quality of life was assessed via mailed survey questionnaires from 2002 to 2005. Information on colorectal cancer, surgery, comorbidities, and complications was obtained from computerized data and analyzed by use of survival analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS: Ostomy and anastomosis survivors were followed up for an average of 12.1 and 11.2 years, respectively. Within 30 days of surgery, 19% of ostomy survivors and 10% of anastomosis survivors experienced complications (P < .01). From 31 days on, the percentages were 69% and 67% (after adjustment, P < .001). Bleeding and postoperative infection were common early complications. Common long-term complications included hernia, urinary retention, hemorrhage, skin conditions, and intestinal obstruction. Ostomy was associated with long-term fistula (odds ratio, 5.4; 95% CI 1.4-21.2), and among ostomy survivors, fistula was associated with reduced health-related quality of life (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Complication rates remain high despite recent advances in methods of surgical treatment. Survivors with ostomy have more complications early in their survivorship period, but complications among anastomosis survivors catch up after 20 years, when the 2 groups have convergent complication rates. Among colorectal cancer survivors with ostomy, fistula has especially important implications for health-related 2010 Feb;53(2):200-12. Meaningful variation in performance: what does variation in quality tell us about improving quality? BACKGROUND: Variance reduction is sometimes considered as a goal of clinical quality improvement. Variance among physicians, hospitals, or health plans has been evaluated as the proportion of total variance (or intraclass correlation, ICC) in a quality measure; low ICCs have been interpreted to indicate low potential for quality improvement at that level. However, the absolute amount of variation, expressed in clinically meaningful units, is less frequently reported. Moreover, changes in variance components have not been studied as quality improves. OBJECTIVES: To examine changes in variance components at primary care physician and medical facility levels as performance improved for 4 quality indicators: systolic blood pressure levels in hypertension; low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in hyperlipidemia; patient-reported care experience scores after primary care visits; and mammography screening rates. POPULATION: Adult members (n = 62,596-410,976) of Kaiser Permanente in Northern California, served by more than 1000 primary care physicians in 35 facilities, from 2001 to 2006. METHODS: Multilevel linear and logistic regression to examine the interphysician and interfacility variances in 4 quality indicators over 6 years, after case-mix adjustment. RESULTS: ICCs were low for all 4 indicators at both levels (0.0021-0.086). Nevertheless, variances at both levels were statistically and clinically significant. For systolic blood pressure and the care experience score, interfacility and interphysician variance as well as ICCs decreased further as quality improved; declines were greater at the facility level. For low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, variability at both levels increased with quality improvement; and for screening mammography, small declines were not statistically significant for either physicians or facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Low proportions of variance do not predict low potential for quality improvement. Despite low ICCs for facilities, quality improvement efforts directed primarily at facilities improved quality for all 4 indicators. Authors: Selby Med Care. 2010 Feb;48(2):133-9. Meaningful variation in performance: a systematic literature review BACKGROUND: Recommendations for directing quality improvement initiatives at particular levels (eg, patients, physicians, provider groups) have been made on the basis of empirical components of variance analyses of performance. OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on use of multilevel analyses of variability in quality. RESEARCH DESIGN: Systematic literature review of English-language articles (n = 39) examining variability and reliability of performance measures in Medline using PubMed (1949-November 2008). RESULTS: Variation was most commonly assessed at facility (eg, hospital, medical center) (n = 19) and physician (n = 18) levels; most articles reported variability as the proportion of total variation attributable to given levels (n = 22). Proportions of variability explained by aggregated levels were generally low (eg, <19% for physicians), and numerous authors concluded that the proportion of variability at a specific level did not justify targeting quality interventions to that level. Few articles based their recommendations on absolute differences among physicians, hospitals, or other levels. Seven of 12 articles that assessed reliability found that reliability was poor at the physician or hospital level due to low proportional variability and small sample sizes per unit, and cautioned that public reporting or incentives based on these measures may be inappropriate. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of variability at levels higher than patients is often found to be 'low.' Although low proportional variability may lead to poor measurement reliability, a number of authors further suggested that it also indicates a lack of potential for quality improvement. Few studies provided additional information to help determine whether variation was, nevertheless, clinically meaningful. Authors: Fung 2010 Feb;48(2):140-8. The association between the number of prescription medications and incident falls in a multi-ethnic population of adult type-2 diabetes patients: the diabetes and aging study BACKGROUND: Use of four or more prescription medications is considered a risk factor for falls in older people. It is unclear whether this polypharmacy-fall relationship differs for adults with diabetes. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association between number of prescription medications and incident falls in a multi-ethnic population of type-2 diabetes patients in order to establish an evidence-based medication threshold for fall risk in diabetes. DESIGN: Baseline survey (1994-1997) with 5 years of longitudinal follow-up. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible subjects (N = 46,946) had type-2 diabetes, were >or=18 years old, and enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified clinically recognized incident falls based on diagnostic codes (ICD-9 codes: E880-E888). Relative to regimens of 0-1 medications, regimens including 4 or more prescription medications were significantly associated with an increased risk of falls [4-5 medications adjusted HR 1.22 (1.04, 1.43), 6-7 medications 1.33 (1.12, 1.58), >7 medications 1.59 (1.34, 1.89)]. None of the individual glucose-lowering medications was found to be significantly associated with a higher risk of falls in predictive models. CONCLUSIONS: The prescription of four or more medications was associated with an increased risk of falls among adult diabetes patients, while no specific glucose-lowering agent was linked to increased risk. Baseline risk of falls and number of baseline medications are additional factors to consider when deciding whether to intensify diabetes treatments.

The role of outpatient facilities in explaining variations in risk-adjusted readmission rates between hospitals OBJECTIVE: Validate risk-adjusted readmission rates as a measure of inpatient quality of care after accounting for outpatient facilities, using premature infants as a test case. STUDY SETTING: Surviving infants born between January 1, 1998 and December 12, 2001 at five Northern California Kaiser Permanente neonatal intensive care units (NICU) with 1-year follow-up at 32 outpatient facilities. STUDY DESIGN: Using a retrospective cohort of premature infants (N=898), Poisson's regression models determined the risk-adjusted variation in unplanned readmissions between 0-1 month, 0-3 months, 3-6 months, and 3-12 months after discharge attributable to patient factors, NICUs, and outpatient facilities. DATA COLLECTION: Prospectively collected maternal and infant hospital data were linked to inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy databases. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Medical and sociodemographic factors explained the largest amount of variation in risk-adjusted readmission rates. NICU facilities were significantly associated with readmission rates up to 1 year after discharge, but the outpatient facility where patients received outpatient care can explain much of this variation. Characteristics of outpatient facilities, not the NICUs, were associated with variations in readmission rates. CONCLUSION: Ignoring outpatient facilities leads to an overstatement of the effect of NICUs on readmissions and ignores a significant cause 2010 Feb;45(1):24-41. Epub 2009 Sep 24. Prevalence of osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with oral bisphosphonate exposure PURPOSE: Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a serious complication associated with bisphosphonate therapy, but its epidemiology in the setting of oral bisphosphonate therapy is poorly understood. The present study examined the prevalence of ONJ in patients receiving chronic oral bisphosphonate therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We mailed a survey to 13,946 members who had received chronic oral bisphosphonate therapy as of 2006 within a large integrated health care delivery system in Northern California. Respondents who reported ONJ, exposed bone or gingival sores, moderate periodontal disease, persistent symptoms, or complications after dental procedures were invited for examination or to have their dental records reviewed. ONJ was defined as exposed bone (of >8 weeks' duration) in the maxillofacial region in the absence of previous radiotherapy. RESULTS: Of the 8,572 survey respondents (71 +/- 9 years, 93% women), 2,159 (25%) reported pertinent dental symptoms. Of these 2,159 patients, 1,005 were examined and an additional 536 provided dental records. Nine ONJ cases were identified, representing a prevalence of 0.10% (95% confidence interval 0.05% to 0.20%) among the survey respondents. Of the 9 cases, 5 had occurred spontaneously (3 in palatal tori) and 4 occurred in previous extraction sites. An additional 3 patients had mandibular osteomyelitis (2 after extraction and 1 with implant failure) but without exposed bone. Finally, 7 other patients had bone exposure that did not fulfill the criteria for ONJ. CONCLUSIONS: ONJ occurred in 1 of 952 survey respondents with oral bisphosphonate exposure (minimum prevalence of 1 in 1,537 of the entire mailed cohort). A similar number had select features concerning for ONJ that did not meet the criteria. The results of the present study provide important data on the spectrum of jaw complications among patients with oral bisphosphonate exposure.

Occupational exposure to bisphenol-A (BPA) and the risk of self-reported male sexual dysfunction BACKGROUND: Animal studies have suggested that bisphenol-A (BPA) is a potential human endocrine disrupter; but evidence from human studies is needed. METHODS: We conducted an occupational cohort study to examine the effect of occupational exposure to BPA on the risk of male sexual dysfunction. Current workers from BPA-exposed and control factories were recruited. The exposed workers were exposed to very high BPA levels in their workplace. Male sexual function was ascertained through in-person interviews using a standard male sexual function inventory. RESULTS: BPA-exposed workers had consistently higher risk of male sexual dysfunction across all domains of male sexual function than the unexposed workers. After controlling for matching variables and potential confounders, exposed workers had a significantly increased risk of reduced sexual desire [odds ratios (OR) = 3.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.8-8.6), erectile difficulty (OR = 4.5, 95% 2.1-9.8), ejaculation difficulty (OR = 7.1, 95% CI 2.9-17.6), and reduced satisfaction with sex life (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 2.3-6.6). A dose-response relationship was observed with an increasing level of cumulative BPA exposure associated with a higher risk of sexual dysfunction. Furthermore, compared with the unexposed workers, BPA-exposed workers reported significantly higher frequencies of reduced sexual function within 1 year of employment in the BPA-exposed factories. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide the first evidence that exposure to BPA in the workplace could have an adverse effect on male sexual dysfunction. Authors: Li D; Yuan W; et al.

Patient-to-nurse ratios and outcomes of moderately preterm infants OBJECTIVE: Moderately preterm infants (30-34(6/7) weeks' gestational age) represent the largest population of NICU residents. Whether their clinical outcomes are associated with differences in NICU nurse-staffing arrangements has not been assessed. The objective of this study was to test the influence of patient-to-nurse ratios (PNRs) on outcomes of care provided to moderately preterm infants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using data from a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study of 850 moderately preterm infants from 10 NICUs in California and Massachusetts, we tested for associations between PNR and several important clinical outcomes by using multivariate random-effects models. To correct for the influence of NICU size, we dichotomized the sample into those with an average daily census of <20 or > or =20 infants. RESULTS: Overall, we found few clinically significant associations between PNR and clinical outcomes of care. Mean PNRs were higher in large compared with small NICUs (2.7 vs 2.1; P < .001). In bivariate analyses, an increase in PNR was associated with a slightly higher daily weight gain (5 g/day), greater gestational age at discharge, any intraventricular hemorrhage, and severe retinopathy of prematurity. After controlling for case mix, NICU size, and site of care, an additional patient per nurse was associated with a decrease in daily weight gain by 24%. Other variables were no longer independently associated with PNR. CONCLUSIONS: In this population of moderately preterm infants, the PNR was associated with a decrease in daily weight gain, but was not associated with other measures of quality. In contrast with findings in the adult intensive care literature, measured clinical outcomes were similar across the range of nurse-staffing arrangements among participating NICUs. We conclude that the PNR is not useful for profiling hospitals' quality of care delivery to moderately preterm infants. Authors: J; Feb;125(2):320-6. Epub 2010 Jan 11. Unintended impacts of a Medicaid prior authorization policy on access to medications for bipolar illness OBJECTIVES: Prior authorization policies (PA) are widely used to control psychotropic medication costs by state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of a Maine Medicaid PA policy on initiation and switching of anticonvulsant and atypical antipsychotic treatments among patients with bipolar disorder. METHODS: We obtained Maine and New Hampshire (comparison state) Medicaid and Medicare claims data for 2001 to 2004; the Maine PA policy was implemented in July 2003. Among continuously enrolled patients with bipolar disorder (Maine: n = 5336; New Hampshire: n = 1376), we used an interrupted times series with comparison group design to estimate changes in rates of initiating new episodes of bipolar treatment and generalized estimating equations models to examine rates of switching therapies among patients under treatment. RESULTS: The Maine PA policy was associated with a marked decrease in rates of initiation of bipolar treatments; a relative reduction of 32.3% (95% CI: 24.8, 39.9) compared with expected rates at 4 months after policy implementation. This decrease was driven primarily by reductions in the initiation of nonpreferred agents. The policy had no discernable impact on rates of switching therapy among patients currently on treatment (RR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.39). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provide evidence that PA implementation can be a barrier to initiation of nonpreferred agents without offsetting increases in initiation of preferred agents, which is a major concern. There is a critical need to evaluate the possible unintended effects of PA policies to achieve optimal health outcomes among low-income patients with chronic mental illness. In addition, more research is needed to understand how these barriers arise and whether specific seriously mentally ill populations or drug classes should be exempted from PA policies.

Patient-provider communication regarding drug costs in Medicare Part D beneficiaries with diabetes: a TRIAD Study BACKGROUND: Little is known about drug cost communications of Medicare Part D beneficiaries with chronic conditions such as diabetes. The purpose of this study is to assess Medicare Part D beneficiaries with diabetes' levels of communication with physicians regarding prescription drug costs; the perceived importance of these communications; levels of prescription drug switching due to cost; and self-reported cost-related medication non-adherence. METHODS: Data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey (58% response rate) of 1,458 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who entered the coverage gap in 2006; adjusted percentages of patients with communication issues were obtained from multivariate regression analyses adjusting for patient demographics and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Fewer than half of patients reported discussing the cost of medications with their physicians, while over 75% reported that such communications were important. Forty-eight percent reported their physician had switched to a less expensive medication due to costs. Minorities, females, and older adults had significantly lower levels of communication with their physicians regarding drug costs than white, male, and younger patients respectively. Patients with < $25 K annual household income were more likely than higher income patients to have talked about prescription drug costs with doctors, and to report cost-related non-adherence (27% vs. 17%, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Medicare Part D beneficiaries with diabetes who entered the coverage gap have low levels of communication with physicians about drug costs, despite the high perceived importance of such communication. Understanding patient and plan-level characteristics differences in communication and use of cost-cutting strategies can inform interventions to help patients manage prescription drug costs.

Mail-order pharmacy use and adherence to diabetes-related medications OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether patients who use mail-order pharmacies were more likely to have good medication adherence than patients who use local pharmacies. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional investigation. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional analyses of patients from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) diabetes registry who received a new antiglycemic, antihypertensive, or lipid-lowering index medication between January 1, 2006, and May 31, 2006. We defined good adherence as medication availability at least 80% of the time (ie, a continuous measure of medication gaps value of < or = 20%) and compared adherence between mail-order users (> or = 66% of refills by mail) and KPNC local pharmacy users (all refills in person). Adherence was calculated from the initial dispensing through 15 months of follow-up, medication discontinuation, or May 31, 2007, whichever came first. We analyzed the data using multivariate logistic regression models, after determining that unmeasured patient-level factors and self-selection did not significantly bias our analyses. RESULTS: A total of 13,922 eligible patients refilled an index medication. Compared with those who used only local KPNC pharmacies, patients who received medications by mail were more likely to have good adherence (84.7% vs 76.9%, P <.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, including days' supply and out-of-pocket costs, mailorder users had better adherence to antiglycemic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering medications (P <.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients who obtained medication refills at local pharmacies, patients who received them by mail were more likely to have good adherence. The association between mail-order use and medication adherence should be evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. Am J Manag Care. 2010 Jan;16(1):33-40. The impact of removing financial incentives from clinical quality indicators: longitudinal analysis of four Kaiser Permanente indicators OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of financial incentives on four clinical quality indicators common to pay for performance plans in the United Kingdom and at Kaiser Permanente in California. DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis. SETTING: 35 medical facilities of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, 1997-2007. PARTICIPANTS: 2 523 659 adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Main outcomes measures Yearly assessment of patient level glycaemic control (HbA(1c) <8%), screening for diabetic retinopathy, control of hypertension (systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg), and screening for cervical cancer. RESULTS: Incentives for two indicators-screening for diabetic retinopathy and for cervical cancer-were removed during the study period. During the five consecutive years when financial incentives were attached to screening for diabetic retinopathy (1999-2003), the rate rose from 84.9% to 88.1%. This was followed by four years without incentives when the rate fell year on year to 80.5%. During the two initial years when financial incentives were attached to cervical cancer screening (1999-2000), the screening rate rose slightly, from 77.4% to 78.0%. During the next five years when financial incentives were removed, screening rates fell year on year to 74.3%. Incentives were then reattached for two years (2006-7) and screening rates began to increase. Across the 35 facilities, the removal of incentives was associated with a decrease in performance of about 3% per year on average for screening for diabetic retinopathy and about 1.6% per year for cervical cancer screening. CONCLUSION: Policy makers and clinicians should be aware that removing facility directed financial incentives from clinical indicators may mean that performance levels decline.

Ethnic differences in anemia among patients with diabetes mellitus: the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) To examine ethnic differences in hemoglobin testing practices and to test the hypothesis that ethnicity is an independent predictor of anemia among patients with diabetes mellitus. We conducted a panel study to assess the rate of hemoglobin testing during 1999-2001 and the period prevalence and incidence of anemia among 79,985 adults with diabetes mellitus receiving care within Kaiser Permanente of Northern California. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <13.0 g/dL in men or < 12.0 g/dL in women. Overall, 82.1% of the cohort was tested for anemia at least once during the 3-year study period. Mixed ethnicity patients were most likely to be tested, followed by whites, blacks, Latinos, and Asians (P < 0.0001). Fifteen percent of the cohort had prevalent anemia at baseline, and an additional 22% of those tested developed anemia during the study period. Anemia was more prevalent among blacks and mixed ethnicity persons compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Anemia was also more prevalent among those >/=70 years of age or with estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). In multivariable models, blacks had higher and Asians had lower odds of prevalent anemia and hazard ratios of incident anemia compared with whites. Within a large, diverse cohort with diabetes, ethnicity was predictive of anemia, even after adjustment for age, level of kidney function, and other potential confounders. Blacks with diabetes are at increased risk of anemia relative to whites. These differences may account for some of the observed ethnic disparities in diabetes complications. Authors: Ahmed AT; Go AS; Warton Validation of an algorithm for categorizing the severity of hospital emergency department visits BACKGROUND: Differentiating between appropriate and inappropriate resource use represents a critical challenge in health services research. The New York University Emergency Department (NYU ED) visit severity algorithm attempts to classify visits to the ED based on diagnosis, but it has not been formally validated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of the NYU algorithm. RESEARCH DESIGN: A longitudinal study in a single integrated delivery system from January 1999 to December 2001. SUBJECTS: A total of 2,257,445 commercial and 261,091 Medicare members of an integrated delivery system. MEASURES: ED visits were classified as emergent, nonemergent, or intermediate severity, using the NYU ED algorithm. We examined the relationship between visit-severity and the probability of future hospitalizations and death using a logistic model with a general estimating equation approach. RESULTS: Among commercially insured subjects, ED visits categorized as emergent were significantly more likely to result in a hospitalization within 1-day (odds ratio = 3.37, 95% CI: 3.31-3.44) 95% CI: 2.62-3.00) than visits categorized as nonemergent. We found similar results in Medicare patients and in sensitivity analyses using different probability thresholds. ED overuse for nonemergent conditions was not related to socio-economic status or insurance type. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence presented supports the validity of the NYU ED visit severity algorithm for differentiating ED visits based on need for hospitalization and/or mortality risk; therefore, it can contribute to evidence-based policies aimed at reducing the use of the ED for nonemergencies.

Insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, and conversion to type 2 diabetes in a multiethnic population: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study OBJECTIVE: Insulin resistance and beta-cell function are major predictors of type 2 diabetes, but studies using direct methods of insulin resistance and secretion are few and relatively small. Furthermore, the strength of these associations has not been tested in different ethnic groups and various states of glucose tolerance, family history of diabetes, and obesity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Predictors of incident diabetes were evaluated in Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and African American participants in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (aged 40-69 years). In 557 participants with normal glucose tolerance and 269 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), insulin sensitivity (insulin sensitivity index [S(I)]) and first-phase insulin secretion (acute insulin response [AIR]) were directly measured using the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. RESULTS: At the 5-year follow-up examination, 128 (15.5%) individuals had developed diabetes. Both S(I) (odds ratio x 1 SD 0.50 [95% CI 0.37-0.68]) and AIR (0.51 [0.40-0.65]) were independent predictors of incident diabetes even after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, center, IGT, family history of diabetes, and BMI. The strength of the relation of S(I) and AIR to incident diabetes was not significantly affected by potential interactions of age, sex, ethnicity, glucose tolerance, BMI, or family history of diabetes (P > or = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Both insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function predict conversion to diabetes in different ethnic groups and various states of glucose tolerance, family history of diabetes, and obesity. The prevention of type 2 diabetes should focus on interventions that improve both insulin resistance and insulin secretion. 2009 Oct 6. Community engagement in biobanking: Experiences from the eMERGE Network Advances in genomic technologies and the promise of 'personalised medicine' have spurred the interest of researchers, healthcare systems, and the general public. However, the success of population-based genetic studies depends on the willingness of large numbers of individuals and diverse communities to grant researchers access to detailed medical and genetic information. Certain features of this kind of research - such as the establishment of biobanks and prospective data collection from participants' electronic medical records - make the potential risks and benefits to participants difficult to specify in advance. Therefore, community input into biobank processes is essential. In this report, we describe community engagement efforts undertaken by six United States biobanks, various outcomes from these engagements, and lessons learned. Our aim is to provide useful insights and potential strategies for the various disciplines that work with communities involved in biobank-based protocol: the Adherence and Intensification of Medications (AIM) study-a cluster randomized controlled effectiveness study BACKGROUND: Many patients with diabetes have poor blood pressure (BP) control. Pharmacological therapy is the cornerstone of effective BP treatment, yet there are high rates both of poor medication adherence and failure to intensify medications. Successful medication management requires an effective partnership between providers who initiate and increase doses of effective medications and patients who adhere to the regimen. METHODS: In this cluster-randomized controlled effectiveness study, primary care teams within sites were randomized to a program led by a clinical pharmacist trained in motivational interviewing-based behavioral counseling approaches and authorized to make BP medication changes or to usual care. This study involved the collection of data during a 14-month intervention period in three Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and two Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities. The clinical pharmacist was supported by clinical information systems that enabled proactive identification of, and outreach to, eligible patients identified on the basis of poor BP control and either medication refill gaps or lack of recent medication intensification. The primary outcome is the relative change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements over time. Secondary outcomes are changes in Hemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), medication adherence determined from pharmacy refill data, and medication intensification rates. DISCUSSION: Integration of the three intervention elements-proactive identification, adherence counseling and medication intensification-is essential to achieve optimal levels of control for high-risk patients. Testing the effectiveness of this intervention at the team level allows us to study the program as it would typically be implemented within a clinic setting, including how it integrates with other elements of care.

The literacy divide: health literacy and the use of an internet-based patient portal in an integrated health system-results from the diabetes study of northern California (DISTANCE) Internet-based patient portals are intended to improve access and quality, and will play an increasingly important role in health care, especially for diabetes and other chronic diseases. Diabetes patients with limited health literacy have worse health outcomes, and limited health literacy may be a barrier to effectively utilizing internet-based health access services. We investigated use of an internet-based patient portal among a well characterized population of adults with diabetes. We estimated health literacy using three validated self-report items. We explored the independent association between health literacy and use of the internet-based patient portal, adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and income. Among 14,102 participants or other ethnicity), 6099 (62%) reported some limitation in health literacy, and 5671 (40%) respondents completed registration for the patient portal registration. In adjusted analyses, those with limited health literacy had higher odds of never signing on to the patient portal (OR 1.7, 1.4 to 1.9) compared with those who did not report any health literacy limitation. Even among those with internet access, the relationship between health literacy and patient portal use persisted (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8). Diabetes patients reporting limited health literacy were less likely to both access and navigate an internet-based patient portal than those with adequate health literacy. Although the internet has potential to greatly expand the capacity and reach of health care systems, current use patterns suggest that, in the absence of participatory design efforts involving those with limited health literacy, those most at risk for poor diabetes health outcomes will fall further behind if health systems increasingly rely on internet-based services.

Characteristics of insured patients with persistent gaps in diabetes care services: the Translating Research into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) study BACKGROUND: Although preventing diabetes complications requires long-term management, little is known about which patients persistently fail to get recommended care. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and correlates of persistent, long-term gaps in diabetes care. METHOD: : The study population included 8392 patients with diabetes. Patient surveys and medical records from 10 health plans over 3 years provided data on socioeconomic characteristics, access to care, social support, and mental and physical health, and diabetes preventive care services. We defined a 'persistent gap' as a participant's missing a preventive care service for the entire 3 years. Services considered included hemoglobin A1c, cholesterol, and albuminuria tests, and foot and dilated eye examinations. RESULTS: Thirty percent of participants had at least 1 persistent gap. The most common gaps were lipid testing (11.6%), microalbuminuria testing (9.7%), and eye examinations (9.0%). Persistent gaps were 18% to 42% higher for young patients, lean persons, those with low income, employed persons, smokers, those with diabetes less than 5 years, and patients with none or 1 comorbid conditions. Sex, education, marital status, family demands, transportation, trust in physicians, and mental health were not associated with gaps in care. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent gaps in diabetes care are common even among insured patients. Patients with lower income, younger age, fewer years of diabetes, having fewer comorbidities, taking fewer medications, and poor health behaviors are vulnerable to persistent gaps in care and a group who warrant targeted interventions to improve preventive diabetes care.

Ethnic disparities in accessing treatment for depression and substance use disorders in an integrated health plan OBJECTIVE: This study examined ethnic differences in accessing treatment for depression and substance use disorders (SUDs) among men and women in a large integrated health plan, and explored factors potentially contributing to health care disparities. METHODS: Participants were 22,543 members ages 20 to 65 who responded to health surveys in 2002 and 2005. Survey questions were linked to provider-assigned diagnoses, electronic medication, psychiatry, and chemical dependency program records. RESULTS: Among women diagnosed with depression, Latinas (p < .01) and Asian-Americans (p < .001) were less likely than Whites to fill an antidepressant prescription. Among men diagnosed with depression, African Americans (p < .01) were less likely than Whites to do so. Among women diagnosed with an SUD, African Americans (p < .05) were less likely than Whites to have one or more chemical dependency program visits. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrated ethnic differences in accessing depression and SUD treatment among patients diagnosed with these disorders, which persisted after controlling for education, income, having a regular health care provider and length of health plan enrollment. Findings highlight potential gender differences in ethnic disparities, lower antidepressant utilization among Asian Americans, and the effects of co-occurring disorders in accessing behavioral health care.

Is the Kaiser Permanente model superior in terms of clinical integration?: a comparative study of Kaiser Permanente, Northern California and the Danish healthcare system BACKGROUND: Integration of medical care across clinicians and settings could enhance the quality of care for patients. To date, there is limited data on the levels of integration in practice. Our objective was to compare primary care clinicians' perceptions of clinical integration and three sub-aspects in two healthcare systems: Kaiser Permanente, Northern California (KPNC) and the Danish healthcare system (DHS). Further, we examined the associations between specific organizational factors and clinical integration within each system. METHODS: Comparable questionnaires were sent to a random sample of primary care clinicians in KPNC (n = 1103) and general practitioners in DHS (n = 700). Data were analysed using multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: More clinicians in KPNC perceived to be part of a clinical integrated environment than did general practitioners in the DHS (OR = 3.06, 95% CI: 2.28, 4.12). Further, more KPNC clinicians reported timeliness of information transfer (OR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.62, 3.13), agreement on roles and responsibilities (OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.47) and established coordination mechanisms in place to ensure effective handoffs (OR = 6.80, 95% CI: 4.60, 10.06). None of the considered organizational factors in the sub-country analysis explained a substantial proportion of the variation in clinical integration. CONCLUSIONS: More primary care clinicians in KPNC reported clinical integration than did general practitioners in the DHS. Focused measures of clinical integration are needed to develop the field of clinical integration and to create the scientific foundation to guide managers searching for evidence based approaches.

The Kaiser Permanente inpatient risk adjustment methodology was valid in an external patient population OBJECTIVES: Accurately predicting hospital mortality is necessary to measure and compare patient care. External validation of predictive models is required to truly prove their utility. This study assessed the Kaiser Permanente inpatient risk adjustment methodology for hospital mortality in a patient population distinct from that used for its derivation. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort study at two hospitals in Ottawa, Canada, involving all inpatients admitted between January 1998 and April 2002 (n=188,724). Statistical models for inpatient mortality were derived on a random half of the cohort and validated on the other half. RESULTS: Inpatient mortality was 3.3%. The model using original parameter estimates had excellent discrimination (c-statistic 89.4, 95% 0.891-0.898) but excellent (c-statistic 0.915, 95% CI 0.912-0.918) and remained so when patient comorbidity was expressed in the model using the Elixhauser Index (0.901, 0.898-0.904) or the Charlson Index (0.894, 0.891-0.897). These models accurately predicted the risk of hospital death. CONCLUSION: The Kaiser Permanente inpatient risk adjustment methodology is a valid model for predicting hospital mortality risk. It performed equally well regardless of methods used to summarize patient comorbidity. Authors: van Walraven C; Escobar Clin Epidemiol. 2010 Jul;63(7):798-803. Epub 2009 Dec 11. Racial disparities in erectile dysfunction among participants in the California Men's Health Study INTRODUCTION: The burden of erectile dysfunction (ED) among different racial and ethnic groups is unclear, in part, because prior studies have not included all four major racial and ethnic groups in the same population-based sample. AIM: To determine the prevalence and odds of ED among all four major racial and ethnic groups after adjustment for demographic, medical, socioeconomic, and lifestyle characteristics. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using data from men, aged 45-69 years, without a diagnosis of prostate cancer (N = 78,445), who completed questionnaires as part of the California Men's Health Study, a large multiethnic cohort study with detailed demographic, medical and, socioeconomic data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Erectile dysfunction measured by a previously validated four-level response question. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of ED by age category was 13%, 24%, and 44% for men aged 45-49 years, 50 and 59 years, and 60-69 years, respectively. In a multivariable model, relative to white men, Hispanic (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99, 1.12), Asian (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.02, 1.19), and other men (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06, 1.1.21) had increased odds of moderate-severe ED, while black men were less likely to report moderate to severe ED (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81, 0.92). Black (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.61) and Asian men (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80, 1.04) were less likely to have severe ED after adjustment for age, socioeconomic status, medical co-morbidities, and lifestyle characteristics. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that the prevalence of ED among different racial and ethnic groups is likely the result of complex phenomena and depends upon the interplay of socioeconomic, demographic, medical, cultural, and lifestyle characteristics. After accounting for these factors, these data suggest that Asian and black men are less likely to have severe ED relative to white men.

The association of patient-physician gender concordance with cardiovascular disease risk factor control and treatment in diabetes BACKGROUND: Gender concordance between patients and their physicians is related to prevention screening and other quality indicators. Research suggests female physicians may place greater emphasis on preventive care than male physicians; however, little is known about whether physician gender and patient-physician gender concordance are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor levels and treatment. Our objective was to examine associations between patient gender, physician gender, and their interaction with CVD risk factor control, medication adherence, and treatment intensification in diabetes. METHODS: In this study, 157,458 Kaiser Permanente Northern California adult diabetes patients with a primary care physician (PCP) were assessed for above target levels of pressure (SBP>or=130 mm Hg) in 2005. Medication adherence and appropriate CVD treatment intensification were assessed using pharmacy data. Probit models assessed the adjusted marginal effects of patient gender, PCP gender, and their interaction on control, adherence, and intensification. RESULTS: Female patients had lower adjusted rates of LDL-C (46% 55%, p<0.001) and SBP control (52% p<0.001) than males. Female patients of female PCPs had the highest adjusted rates of HbA1c control of the four patient-physician gender dyads (70% vs. 66%-68%, p<0.05). Male patients were more likely than female patients to receive treatment intensification for high SBP (60% vs. 57%, p<0.001). Female PCPs were more likely than their male counterparts to intensify therapy for hyperlipidemia and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Patient and physician gender and gender concordance are modestly associated with CVD risk factor control and treatment in diabetes. Further understanding of these differences could lead to improved CVD outcomes of myelosuppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease: implications for monitoring recommendations BACKGROUND & AIMS: Thiopurines (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine) can induce life-threatening myelosuppression. This study determined the frequency, timing, and outcomes of mild and severe myelosuppression after initiation of thiopurine therapy. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were new users of thiopurines; those tested for thiopurine methyltransferase levels before therapy were excluded. Patients were followed from their first thiopurine prescription until the earliest of severe leukopenia (white blood cell count, <1.0 x 10(9)/L), severe thrombocytopenia (platelet level, <20 x 10(9)/L), the end of therapy, the first gap in therapy, disenrollment, or December 31, 2006. RESULTS: Among 1997 new users, the incidence of severe leukopenia per 100 person-months was 0.16 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.29; n = 6) in weeks 0 to 8, 0.00 in weeks 9 to 24, and 0.01 (95% CI, 0-0.03; n = 3) after week 26 of therapy. The incidence of severe neutropenia and severe thrombocytopenia per 100 person-months during the first 8 weeks of therapy was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.31-0.80; n = 19) and 0.08 (95% CI, 0.02-0.23; n = 3), respectively. During the first 8 weeks, the median duration from a normal white blood cell count to severe leukopenia was 13 days (range, 8-26 d) and to severe neutropenia was 14 days (range, 7-23 d). CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of severe myelosuppression justifies frequent monitoring during the first 8 weeks of therapy. Subsequently, the rate of severe myelosuppression and the proportion of patients who progress from mild to severe myelosuppression decrease, justifying less-frequent monitoring. 2009 Jul 22. Validity of computerized diagnoses, procedures, and drugs for inflammatory bowel disease in a northern California managed care organization PURPOSE: Resources for studying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are needed in evaluations of drug safety including traditional drugs and new biologics agents. We developed an IBD registry, with ascertainment from computerized visit information. OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize the positive predictive value (PPV) of IBD case-finding using computerized data compared with chart review. METHODS: We identified 2906 persons aged 89 years or younger with one or more IBD diagnoses in computerized visit data during the period of 1996-2002. The diagnosis of IBD was confirmed through chart review. Adopting chart review as the gold standard, the validity of computerized encounter data to determine IBD was estimated. RESULTS: Among the 2906 study subjects with one or more ICD-9 diagnosis codes of 555 or 556 in computerized data, 81% were confirmed as having IBD by chart review. Defining cases as those who underwent two or more visits without regard to diagnostic procedures or drug utilization maximized the correct classification of cases (PPV, 95%). CONCLUSIONS: The quality of IBD diagnoses in computerized data is adequate to meet the aims of a wide range of research studies.

A new measure of medication affordability This study developed a new measure of medication affordability that examines out-of-pocket drug expenses relative to available household resources. The authors assessed the spending patterns of approximately 2.1 million poor households (< or =100% federal poverty level) of adults aged 51 and older by Medicaid status. The data were drawn from the 2000-2001 Health and Retirement Study. Household spending was categorized into three broad types: basic living, health care, and discretionary. Older (aged 51 or older) poor households without Medicaid allocated about 72% of their total resources ($17,421, SE $783) to basic living needs. In comparison, those with Medicaid had scarcer total resources ($12,498, SE $423) and allocated 85% to basic living needs. Medication costs consumed the largest proportion of health care expenses for both types of poor households (Medicaid: $463, SE $67; non-Medicaid: $970, SE $102). After paying for basic living needs and health care costs, these families had, on average, only $16 left each week. Poor families have very few resources available for anything beyond basic living needs, even when they have Medicaid coverage. There is no great reservoir of discretionary funds to pay for increases in cost-sharing under Medicaid and Medicare Part D. Soc Work Public Health. 2009 Nov-Dec;24(6):600-12. Diabetes and poor disease control: is comorbid depression associated with poor medication adherence or lack of treatment intensification? OBJECTIVE: To hypothesize that patients with comorbid depression and diabetes and poor disease control will have poorer adherence to disease control medication and less likelihood of physician intensification of treatment. Many patients with diabetes fail to achieve American Diabetes Association Guidelines for glycemic, blood pressure and lipid control. Depression is a common comorbidity and may affect disease control through adverse effects on adherence and physician intensification of treatment. METHODS: In a cohort of 4117 patients with diabetes, depression was measured at baseline with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Patient adherence and physician intensification of treatment were measured in those who had evidence of poor disease control (HbA(1c) >or=8.0%, LDL >or=130 mg/dL, systolic blood pressure >or=140 mm Hg) over this 5-year period. Poor adherence was defined as having medication refill gaps for >or=20% of days covered for medications prescribed for each of these conditions. Treatment intensification was defined as an increased medication dosage in a class, an increase in the number of medication classes, or a switch to a different class within 3-month periods before and after notation of above target levels. RESULTS: Among patients with diabetes and poor disease control, depression was associated with an increased likelihood of poor adherence to diabetes control medications (odds ratio [OR] = 1.98; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = (OR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.47, 2.88), and LDL control medications (OR = 2.43; 95% CI = 1.19, 4.97). In patients with poor disease control who were adherent to medication or not yet started on a medication, depression was not associated with differences in likelihood of physician intensification of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with diabetes and poor disease control, depression is an important risk factor for poor patient adherence to medications, but not lack of treatment intensification by physicians.

Impact of universal bilirubin screening on severe hyperbilirubinemia and phototherapy use OBJECTIVE: The goal was to assess the impact of universal bilirubin screening on severe hyperbilirubinemia and phototherapy use. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of 358086 infants of > or =35 weeks and > or =2000 g born between January 1, 1995, and June 30, 2007, we obtained demographic data, bilirubin levels, and codes for inpatient phototherapy from existing databases. We compared the incidence of high total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels and phototherapy before and after implementation of universal screening and examined risk factors for high TSB levels. RESULTS: A total of 38182 infants (10.6%) were born at facilities that had implemented universal bilirubin screening. Compared with infants born at facilities that were not screening, these infants had a 62% lower incidence of TSB levels exceeding the American Academy of Pediatrics exchange guideline (0.17% vs 0.45%; P < .001), received twice the inpatient phototherapy (9.1% vs 4.2%; P < .001), and had slightly longer birth hospitalization lengths of stay (50.9 vs 48.7 hours; P < .001). Of those receiving phototherapy, 56% after initiation of universal screening had TSB levels at which phototherapy was recommended by the guideline, compared with 70% before screening. The adjusted odds ratio for developing TSB levels exceeding the guideline value was 0.28 (95% confidence interval: 0.20-0.40) for those born at a facility using TSB screening and 0.28 (95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.42) for those born at a facility using transcutaneous bilirubin screening. CONCLUSIONS: Universal bilirubin screening was associated with a significantly lower incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia but also with increased phototherapy use.

New prescription medication gaps: a comprehensive measure of adherence to new prescriptions OBJECTIVE: Describe a novel approach to comprehensively summarize medication adherence. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry (n approximately 220,000) STUDY DESIGN: In a new prescription cohort design (27,329 subjects prescribed new medications), we used pharmacy utilization data to estimate adherence during 24 months follow-up. Proportion of time without sufficient medications (medication gaps) was estimated using a novel measure (New Prescription Medication Gaps [NPMG]) and compared with a traditional measure of adherence. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data derived from electronic medical records and survey responses. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-two percent of patients did not become ongoing users (had zero or only one dispensing of the new prescription). The proportion of newly prescribed patients that never became ongoing users was eightfold greater than the proportion who maintained ongoing use, but with inadequate adherence. Four percent of those with at least two dispensings discontinued therapy during the 24 months follow-up. NPMG was significantly associated with high out-of-pocket costs, self-reported adherence, and clinical response to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: NPMG is a valid adherence measure. Findings also suggest a larger burden of inadequate adherence than previously thought. Public health efforts have traditionally focused on improving adherence in ongoing users; clearly more attention is needed to address nonpersistence in the very first stages after a new medication is prescribed.

Health-related quality of life among long-term rectal cancer survivors with an ostomy: manifestations by sex PURPOSE: Intestinal stomas can pose significant challenges for long-term (> or = 5 years) rectal cancer (RC) survivors. Specifying common challenges and sociodemographic or clinical differences will further the development of tailored interventions to improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a matched cross-sectional study of long-term RC survivors conducted in three Kaiser Permanente regions. The mailed questionnaire included the modified City of Hope Quality of Life-Ostomy (mCOH-QOL-Ostomy) and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, version 2 (SF-36v2). Groups surveyed were permanent ostomates (cases) and those who did not require an ostomy (controls). RC survivors were matched on sex, age, and time since diagnosis. Comparisons between groups used regression analysis with adjustment for age, comorbidity score, history of radiation therapy, income, and work status. RESULTS: Response rate was 54% (491 of 909). Cases and controls had similar demographic characteristics. On the basis of the mCOH-QOL-Ostomy, both male and female cases had significantly worse social well-being compared with controls, while only female cases reported significantly worse overall HRQOL and psychological well-being. For younger females (< age 75 years), ostomy had a greater impact on physical well-being compared with older females. Based on the SF-36v2, statistically significant and meaningful differences between female cases and controls were observed for seven of the eight scales and on the physical and mental component summary scores. CONCLUSION: Men and women report a different profile of challenges, suggesting the need for targeted or sex-specific interventions to improve HRQOL in this population. This may include focus on physical HRQOL for female ostomy survivors younger than age 75. Authors: 2009 Oct 1;27(28):4664-70. Epub 2009 Aug 31. The association of patient age with cardiovascular disease risk factor treatment and control in diabetes BACKGROUND: While inadequate treatment intensification may contribute to sub-optimal CVD risk factor control in older patients with diabetes, the relationship between patient age and treatment intensification is largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in treatment intensification and control for blood pressure (BP), lipids and A1c in older vs. younger adults with diabetes. METHODS: A total of 161,697 Kaiser Permanente Northern California adult diabetes patients were stratified by age (<50, 50-64, 65-74 and 75-85) assessed the marginal effects of patient age on treatment intensification and control for all three CVD risk factors. RESULTS: Patients aged 50-64 and 65-74 were significantly more likely to receive treatment intensification for elevated SBP than patients under 50 (74% and 76% vs. 71%) and significantly less likely to receive treatment intensification for elevated A1c (73% and 72% vs. 76%), with no differences noted for LDL-c treatment. Older patients had significantly worse SBP control, but better control of A1c and LDL-c. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatment intensification rates and control of BP, A1c and LDL cholesterol control varied somewhat by age, suggesting room for further improvement in treatment intensification and control. 2009 Sep;24(9):1049-52.

The population-level impacts of a national health insurance program and franchise midwife clinics on achievement of prenatal and delivery care standards in the Philippines OBJECTIVES: Adequate prenatal and delivery care are vital components of successful maternal health care provision. Starting in 1998, two programs were widely expanded in the Philippines: a national health insurance program (PhilHealth); and a donor-funded franchise of midwife clinics (Well Family Midwife Clinics). This paper examines population-level impacts of these interventions on achievement of minimum standards for prenatal and delivery care. METHODS: Data from two waves of the Demographic and Health Surveys, conducted before (1998) and after (2003) scale-up of the interventions, are employed in a pre/post-study design, using longitudinal multivariate logistic and linear regression models. RESULTS: After controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, the PhilHealth insurance program scale-up was associated with increased odds of receiving at least four prenatal visits (OR 1.04 [95% CI 1.01-1.06]) and receiving a visit during the first trimester of pregnancy (OR 1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.06]). Exposure to midwife clinics was not associated with significant changes in achievement of prenatal care standards. While both programs were associated with slight increases in the odds of delivery in a health facility, these increases were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that expansion of an insurance program with accreditation standards was associated with increases in achievement of minimal standards for prenatal care among women in the Philippines.

Complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia: the risk of unrecognized adenocarcinoma and value dilation and whether preoperative dilation and curettage (D&C) lowers the risk of unexpected at hysterectomy. METHODS: Women with complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia on sampling from January 2000 to May 2008 who underwent hysterectomy within 6 months were identified using a pathology database. Patient age, sampling procedures, and hysterectomy pathology were recorded. Women were categorized as having either an office biopsy-based evaluation or a curettage-based evaluation. The proportion of women with cancer at surgery was estimated and compared for the two groups. RESULTS: Of 824 women with complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia on initial sampling, 48% were found to have cancer. For 100 women, cancer was diagnosed preoperatively by additional sampling before hysterectomy. For the remaining 724, 298 (41%) had unexpected cancer at hysterectomy. The diagnosis of complex endometrial hyperplasia 531 (73%) and curettage-based for 193 (27%). The risk of cancer for women who had a D&C was significantly lower than for those who had biopsy, but still of concern (30% compared with 45%, P<.001), as was the risk of myometrial invasion (18% compared with 25%, P=.05). Age was strongly correlated to risk of cancer, invasive cancer, and deeply invasive or grade 3 disease. CONCLUSION: Dilation and curettage lowered the risk of unexpected cancer compared with biopsy, but 18% of women still had invasive cancer found at hysterectomy. The risk of unexpected cancer is strongly related to age. Dilation and curettage can help detect cancer preoperatively but is not reliable for excluding cancer. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.

Gender differences in sleep disruption and fatigue on quality of life among persons with ostomies STUDY OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to examine differences in sleep disruption and fatigue of men and women colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors with intestinal ostomies and associated health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). METHODS: Participants in this cross-sectional study of long-term (> 5 years) CRC survivors received care at Kaiser Permanente. Measures included the City of Hope QOL Ostomy questionnaire with narrative comments for ostomy-related 'greatest challenges.' The Short Form-36 Version 2 (SF-36v2) health survey provided physical (PCS) and mental composite scale (MCS) scores to examine generic HR-QOL. The 'sleep disruption' and 'fatigue' items from the ostomy questionnaire (scale from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating better HR-QOL) were dependent variables, while independent variables included age, ethnicity, education, partnered status, body mass index, and time since surgery. Data were analyzed using chi-square for nominal variables, Student t-tests for continuous variables, and logistic regression with significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: On the ostomy-specific measure, women (n = 118) compared to men (n = 168) reported more sleep disruption (p < 0.01), adjusted for age, and greater levels of fatigue (p < 0.01), adjusted for time since surgery. Women's PCS and MCS scores indicated poorer HR-QOL compared to men, and differences were clinically meaningful. Qualitative narrative comments suggested that sleep disruption could stem from ostomy-associated fear of or actual leakage during sleep. CONCLUSION: Although women CRC survivors with ostomies report more sleep disruption and fatigue, which is reflected in their reduced physical and mental health scores on the SF-36v2 compared to men with ostomies, their stated reasons for disrupted sleep are similar to their male counterparts. These findings can provide a foundation for gender-relevant ostomy interventions to improve sleep and HR-QOL in this Med. 2009 Aug 15;5(4):335-43. Time trends in therapies and outcomes for adult inflammatory bowel disease, Northern California, 1998-2005 BACKGROUND & AIMS: The management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become increasingly complicated, and it is unknown whether poor outcomes (prolonged steroid use, hospitalizations, and surgery) have declined in the general population. METHODS: This multilevel study used computerized clinical data. The study comprised 2892 adults with Crohn's disease (CD) and 5895 with ulcerative colitis (UC) who received care at 16 medical centers within an integrated care organization in Northern California between 1998 and 2005. RESULTS: Time trends included (1) a shift in gastroenterology-related visits from the gastroenterology division to primary care; (2) increased use of IBD-related drugs, except for a 7% decline in use of 5-aminosalicylate in CD and no change in steroid use for CD; (3) for the prevalence of prolonged steroid exposure (120 days of continuous use), a 36% decline for CD with a 27% increase for UC; (4) declines in the hospitalization rates of 33% for CD and 29% for UC; and (5) for the surgery rate, no significant change for CD with a 50% decline for UC. CONCLUSIONS: Declines in prolonged steroid exposure and the hospitalization rate for CD and in the hospitalization and surgery rate for UC are encouraging; however, the increase in prolonged steroid exposure for UC merits concern and further investigation. The variability in care patterns observed in this study suggests lack of standardization of care and the opportunity to identify targets for quality improvement. These findings should stimulate research to quantify the effect of current trends in IBD management. 13. High-deductible health insurance plans: efforts to sharpen a blunt instrument High deductible-based health insurance plans require consumers to pay for care until reaching the deductible amount. However, information is limited on how well consumers understand their benefits and how they respond to these costs. In telephone interviews, we found that consumers had limited knowledge about their deductibles yet frequently reported changing their care-seeking behavior because of the cost. Poor knowledge limited the effects of the deductible design, with some consumers avoiding care for services that were exempt from the deductible. Consumers need more information and decision support to understand their benefits and to differentiate when care is necessary, discretionary, or unnecessary.

Cluster randomized trials to study the comparative effectiveness of therapeutics: stakeholders' concerns and recommendations PURPOSE: To describe the concerns raised by health plan members, providers and purchasers related to studying the comparative effectiveness of therapeutics using cluster randomized trials (CRTs) within health plans. An additional goal was to develop recommendations for increasing acceptability. METHODS: Eighty-four qualitative in-depth telephone interviews were conducted; 50 with health plan members, 21 with providers, and 13 with purchasers. Interviews focused on stakeholders' concerns about and recommendations for conducting CRTs in health plans. RESULTS: Members expressed concerns that CRTs might compromise their healthcare. Providers and purchasers recognized the value of and the need for comparative effectiveness research. Providers expressed concerns that they would not have sufficient time to discuss a CRT with patients, and that participation in such a study could negatively impact their relationships with patients. Purchasers would want assurances that study participation would not result in members receiving lesser care, and that benefits would remain equitable for all members. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into how health plan members, providers and purchasers might react to a CRT being conducted in their health plan. The recommendations reported here provide guidance for researchers and policy makers considering this methodological approach and suggest that with sufficient preparation and planning CRTs can be an acceptable and efficient methodology for studying the comparative effectiveness of therapeutics in real world settings.

BACKGROUND: Research on self-care for chronic disease has not examined time requirements. Translating Research into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD), a multi-site study of managed care patients with diabetes, is among the first to assess self-care time. OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between socioeconomic position and extra time patients spend on foot care, shopping/cooking, and exercise due to diabetes. DATA: Eleven thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven patient surveys from 2000 to 2001. METHODS: Bayesian two-part models were used to estimate associations of self-reported extra time spent on self-care with race/ethnicity, education, and income, controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Proportions of patients spending no extra time on foot care, shopping/cooking, and exercise were, respectively, 37, 52, and 31%. Extra time spent on foot care and shopping/cooking was greater among racial/ethnic minorities, less-educated and lower-income patients. For example, African-Americans were about 10 percentage points more likely to report spending extra time on foot care than whites and extra time spent was about 3 min more per day. DISCUSSION: Extra time spent on self-care was greater for socioeconomically disadvantaged patients than for advantaged patients, perhaps because their perceived opportunity cost of time is lower or they cannot afford substitutes. Our findings suggest that poorly controlled diabetes risk factors among disadvantaged populations may not be attributable to self-care practices. Authors: Group Health Econ. 2009 Jun;18(6):645-63. Use of the motor performance checklist to study motor outcomes in 5-year-olds AIM: To report findings about the Motor Performance Checklist (MPC) for 5-year-olds, a simple 12-item instrument for assessing gross and fine motor skills, in a research study of neurodevelopmental outcomes after neonatal events. METHODS: We trained 10 examiners to use the MPC in a study of the outcomes of neonatal jaundice and dehydration in 339 5-year-old children. We compared MPC scores with those on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised (WPPSI-R), the Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration-Fourth Edition (VMI-4), and a standard neurological examination, and compared failure rates on each MPC item across examiners. Parent concerns about their child's development were addressed using the Parent Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS). RESULTS: Children who 'failed' the MPC had 7-10 points lower mean scores on the WPPSI-R subscales (P = 0.001), 9-10 points lower mean scores on the VMI-4 subscales (P = 0.001), and were almost twice as likely to have a 'questionable' neurological examination score (adjusted OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.00-3.53, P = 0.005). On the PEDS, only the concern about the use of arms and hands was significantly associated with MPC failure. We found significant sex differences on four of the 12 MPC items. We also found differences in failure rates by different examiners. CONCLUSIONS: MPC scores correlated with other measures of neurodevelopment. Because of different failure rates across examiners, examiner terms need to be included if it is used in research studies. Authors: Liljestrand P; Child Health. 2009 Jun;45(6):368-74.

Identifying risk factors for racial disparities in diabetes outcomes: the translating research into action for diabetes study BACKGROUND: Versus whites, blacks with diabetes have poorer control of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), and higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as well as higher rates of morbidity and microvascular complications. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether several mutable risk factors were more strongly associated with poor control of multiple intermediate outcomes among blacks with diabetes than among similar whites. DESIGN: Case-control study. SUBJECTS: A total of 764 blacks and whites with diabetes receiving care within 8 managed care health plans. MEASURES: Cases were patients with poor control of at least 2 of 3 intermediate outcomes (HbA1c > or =8.0%, SBP > or =140 mmHg, LDL cholesterol > or =130 mg/dL) and controls were patients with good control of all 3 (HbA1c <8.0%, SBP <140 mmHg, LDL cholesterol <130 mg/dL). In analyses, we determined whether each of several potentially mutable risk factors, including depression, poor adherence to medications, low self-efficacy for reducing cardiovascular risk, and poor patient-provider communication, predicted case or control status. RESULTS: Among blacks but not whites, in multivariate analyses depression (odds ratio: 2.28; 95% confidence interval: ratio: 1.96; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-3.81) were associated with greater odds of being a case rather than a control. None of the other risk factors were associated for either blacks or whites. CONCLUSIONS: Depression and missing medication doses are more strongly associated with poor diabetes control among blacks than in whites. These 2 risk factors may represent important targets for patient-level interventions to address racial disparities in diabetes CM Med Care. 2009 Jun;47(6):700-6. Numbers needed to treat with phototherapy according to American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines OBJECTIVES: Our aims were to estimate the efficacy of hospital phototherapy for neonatal jaundice and the number needed to treat to prevent one infant from reaching the exchange transfusion level. METHODS: From a cohort of 281 898 infants weighing > or =2000 g born at > or =35 weeks' gestation at 12 Northern California Kaiser hospitals from 1995 to 2004, we identified 22 547 who had a 'qualifying total serum bilirubin level' within 3 mg/dL of the American Academy of Pediatrics 2004 guideline phototherapy threshold. We used multiple logistic regression to estimate the efficacy of hospital phototherapy within 8 hours at preventing the bilirubin level from exceeding the 2004 guideline's exchange transfusion threshold within 48 hours. We combined this efficacy estimate with other predictors of risk to estimate the numbers needed to treat at different values of covariates. RESULTS: Of the 22 547 eligible newborns, 5251 (23%) received hospital phototherapy within 8 hours of their qualifying bilirubin level. Only 354 (1.6%) ever exceeded the guideline exchange transfusion threshold; 187 (0.8%) did so within 48 hours. Among infants who did not have a positive direct antiglobulin test, hospital phototherapy within 8 hours was highly effective (adjusted odds ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.34). For infants with bilirubin levels 0-0.9 mg/dL above the phototherapy threshold, the estimated number needed to treat at mean values of covariates was 222 (95% CI: 107-502) for boys and 339 from 10 > or =3-day-old 41-week girls. Hospital phototherapy was less effective for infants direct antiglobulin test-positive infants (adjusted odds ratio 0.55; 95% CI: 0.21-1.45; P = 0.01 for the direct antiglobulin test x phototherapy interaction). CONCLUSIONS: While hospital phototherapy is effective, the number needed to treat according to current guidelines varies considerably across different infant subgroups. May;123(5):1352-9. The effectiveness of diabetes care management in managed care OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of the diabetes care management (CM) program in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) by determining the proportion of enrollees that met program entry criteria and by comparing intermediate outcomes trajectories of enrollees versus similar patients who did not receive CM. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study with propensity score matching of CM patients to control subjects. METHODS: Care management program entry criteria were assessed for 179,249 adult patients with diabetes mellitus in 2003 and were compared between CM and non-CM patients in that year. Propensity score matching was used to match CM patients with comparable non-CM controls. Preprogram and (LDL-C), and systolic blood pressure levels, as well as medication adherence, and treatment intensification rates of CM patients, were compared for enrollees versus controls. RESULTS: Sixteen percent of CM patients were ineligible by program entry criteria. Small but statistically significant differences in A1C and LDL-C levels favoring CM patients were observed during 15 months of postprogram follow-up. Care management patients were more likely to receive treatment intensification for poorly controlled hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Improvements in all 3 cardiovascular risk factor levels were observed for all KPNC patients with diabetes regardless of CM participation. CONCLUSIONS: Eligibility guidelines for diabetes CM were not strictly adhered to in this program. Nevertheless, in a population with improving risk factor control, patients entering CM experienced slightly greater improvement. Authors: Schmittdiel May;15(5):295-301. Infant functional status: the timing of physiologic maturation of premature infants OBJECTIVE: To describe the maturation of physiologic milestones in preterm infants born between 24 and 32 weeks' gestational age. METHODS: We abstracted daily physiologic maturity information on 865 infants born at or =32 weeks' gestation in the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program between 1998 and 2001. Data included ventilator and incubator settings, body temperature, apnea and bradycardia spells, use of methylxanthines, feeding method, and requirements for intravenous fluids. Multivariable quantile regression models identified risk factors associated with longer postmenstrual age to achieve various physiologic milestones, including time to full oral feeding, time to wean from supplemental heat, the last day with an apnea or bradycardia episode, the last day on methylxanthine medications, and the last day on supplemental oxygen. RESULTS: Most milestones were achieved between 34 and 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, although there were wide variations between patients. In most cases, feeding and oxygen milestones were achieved last. For each milestone there was a monotonic relationship between birth gestational age and the median achievement postmenstrual age. However, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and necrotizing enterocolitis strongly influenced these results in infants of younger gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides epidemiologic data describing the achievement of basic physiologic milestones that influence the discharge of a premature infant. This work serves as an additional contribution in the development of algorithms to monitor the progress of neonates through their initial hospitalization and provides a reference population for future interventions to improve the physiologic maturation of prematurely born Prior authorization for antidepressants in Medicaid: effects among disabled dual enrollees BACKGROUND: Prior authorization is a popular, but understudied, strategy for reducing medication costs. We evaluated the impact of a controversial prior authorization policy in Michigan Medicaid on antidepressant use and health outcomes among dual Medicaid and Medicare enrollees with a Social Security Disability Insurance designation of permanent disability. METHODS: We linked Medicaid and Medicare (2000-2003) claims for dual enrollees in Michigan and a comparison state, Indiana. Using interrupted time-series and longitudinal data analysis, we estimated the impact of the policy on antidepressant medication use, treatment initiation, disruptions in therapy, and adverse health events among continuously enrolled (Michigan, n = 28 798; Indiana, n = 21 769) and newly treated (Michigan, n = 3671; Indiana, n = 2400) patients. RESULTS: In Michigan, the proportion of patients starting nonpreferred agents declined from 53% prepolicy to 20% postpolicy. The prior authorization policy was associated with a small sustained decrease in therapy initiation overall (9 per 10,000 population; P = .007). We also observed a short-term increase in switching among established users of nonpreferred agents overall (risk ratio, 2.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.87-4.42) and among those with depression (2.04; 1.22-3.42). However, we found no evidence of increased disruptions in treatment or adverse events (ie, hospitalization, emergency department use) among newly treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prior authorization was associated with increased use of preferred agents with no evidence of disruptions in therapy or adverse health events among new users. However, unintended effects on treatment initiation and switching among patients already taking the drug were also observed, lending support to the state's previous decision to discontinue prior approval for antidepressants in 2003.

Hypoglycemic episodes and risk of dementia in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus CONTEXT: Although acute hypoglycemia may be associated with cognitive impairment in children with type 1 diabetes, no studies to date have evaluated whether hypoglycemia is a risk factor for dementia in older patients with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To determine if hypoglycemic episodes severe enough to require hospitalization are associated with an increased risk of dementia in a population of older patients with type 2 diabetes followed up for 27 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A longitudinal cohort study from 1980-2007 of 16,667 patients with a mean age of 65 years and type 2 diabetes who are members of an integrated health care delivery system in northern California. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hypoglycemic events from 1980-2002 were collected and reviewed using hospital discharge and emergency department diagnoses. Cohort members with no prior diagnoses of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or general memory complaints as of January 1, 2003, were followed up for a dementia diagnosis through January 15, 2007. Dementia risk was examined using Cox proportional hazard regression models, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, duration of diabetes, 7-year mean glycated hemoglobin, diabetes treatment, duration of insulin use, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, transient cerebral ischemia, and end-stage renal disease. RESULTS: At least 1 episode of hypoglycemia was diagnosed in 1465 patients (8.8%) and dementia was diagnosed in 1822 patients (11%) during follow-up; 250 patients had both dementia and at least 1 episode of hypoglycemia (16.95%). Compared with patients with no hypoglycemia, patients with single or multiple episodes had a graded increase in risk with fully adjusted hazard ratios (HRs): for 1 episode (HR, 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.49); 2 episodes (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.37-2.36); and 3 or more episodes (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.42-2.64). The attributable risk of dementia between individuals with and without a history of hypoglycemia was 2.39% per year (95% CI, 1.72%-3.01%). Results were not attenuated when medical utilization rates, length of health plan membership, or time since initial diabetes diagnosis were added to the model. When examining emergency department admissions for hypoglycemia for association with risk of dementia (535 episodes), results were similar (compared with patients with 0 episodes) with fully adjusted HRs: for 1 episode (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.12-1.78) and for 2 or more episodes (HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.57-3.55). CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients with type 2 diabetes, a history of severe hypoglycemic episodes was associated with a greater risk of dementia. Whether minor hypoglycemic episodes increase risk of dementia is intensification and risk factor control: toward more clinically relevant quality measures BACKGROUND: Intensification of pharmacotherapy in persons with poorly controlled chronic conditions has been proposed as a clinically meaningful process measure of quality. OBJECTIVE: To validate measures of treatment intensification by evaluating their associations with subsequent control in hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus across 35 medical facility populations in Kaiser Permanente, Northern California. DESIGN: Hierarchical analyses of associations of improvements in facility-level treatment intensification rates from 2001 to 2003 with patient-level risk factor levels at the end of 2003. PATIENTS: Members (515,072 and 626,130; age >20 years) with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and/or diabetes mellitus in 2001 and 2003, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: Treatment intensification for each risk factor defined as an increase in number of drug classes prescribed, of dosage for at least 1 drug, or switching to a drug from another class within 3 months of observed poor risk factor control. RESULTS: Facility-level improvements in treatment intensification rates between 2001 and 2003 were strongly associated with greater likelihood of being in control at the end of 2003 (P < or = 0.05 for each risk factor) after adjustment for patient- and facility-level covariates. Compared with facility rankings based solely on control, addition of percentages of poorly controlled patients who received treatment intensification changed 2003 rankings substantially: 14%, 51%, and 29% of the facilities changed ranks by 5 or more positions for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment intensification is tightly linked to improved control. Thus, it deserves consideration as a process measure for motivating quality improvement and possibly for measuring clinical performance. Authors: 2009 Apr;47(4):395-402. Time to send the preemie home? Additional maturity at discharge and subsequent health care costs and outcomes OBJECTIVE: To determine whether longer stays of premature infants allowing for increased physical maturity result in subsequent postdischarge cost savings that help counterbalance increased inpatient costs. DATA SOURCES: One thousand four hundred and two premature infants born in the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program between 1998 and 2002. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Using multivariate matching with a time-dependent propensity score we matched 701 'Early' babies to 701 'Late' babies (developmentally similar at the time the earlier baby was sent home but who were discharged on average 3 days later) and assessed subsequent costs and clinical outcomes. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Late babies accrued inpatient costs after the Early baby was already home, yet costs after discharge through 6 months were virtually identical across groups, as were clinical outcomes. Overall, after the Early baby went home, the Late-Early cost difference was $5,016 (p.0001). A sensitivity analysis suggests our conclusions would not easily be altered by failure to match on some unmeasured covariate. CONCLUSIONS: In a large integrated health care system, if a baby is ready for discharge (as defined by the typical criteria), staying longer increased inpatient costs but did not reduce postdischarge costs nor Apr;44(2 Pt 1):444-63.

Exploring household income as a predictor of psychological well-being among long-term colorectal cancer survivors PURPOSE: The purpose of this analysis was to determine the unique contribution of household income to the variance explained in psychological well-being (PWB) among a sample of colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of data collected as part of the Health-Related Quality of Life in Long-Term Colorectal Cancer Survivors Study, which included CRC survivors with (cases) and without (controls) ostomies. The dataset included socio-demographic, health status, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) information. HRQOL was assessed with the modified City of Hope Quality of Life (mCOH-QOL)-Ostomy questionnaire and SF-36v2. To assess the relationship between income and PWB, a hierarchical linear regression model was constructed combining data from both cases and controls. RESULTS: After accounting for the proportion of variance in PWB explained by the other independent variables in the model, the additional variance explained by income was significant (R (2) increased from 0.228 to 0.250; P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Although the study design does not allow causal inference, these results demonstrate a significant relationship between income and PWB in CRC survivors. The findings suggest that for non-randomized group comparisons of HRQOL, income should, at the very least, be included as a control variable in the 2009 Mar;18(2):157-61. Epub 2009 Jan 10. Medicare Part D coverage gap and diabetes beneficiaries OBJECTIVE: To examine drug costs and entry and exit rates into the Part D coverage gap for beneficiaries with diabetes in Medicare Advantage managed care plans. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. METHODS: Study patients were Medicare Advantage Part D beneficiaries with diabetes from 2 large California health plans who were continuously enrolled in 2006 and had a drug coverage gap starting at $2250. Entry and exit into the gap, total drug costs, and out-of-pocket drug costs were determined using pharmacy databases. RESULTS: In 2006, 26% of the 42,801 beneficiaries with diabetes reached the coverage gap; 2% of beneficiaries exited the gap and qualified for catastrophic coverage. Beneficiaries incurred a mean of $2182 in total drug costs during 2006. Drug expenditures remained stable over the year for beneficiaries who did not enter the gap. For beneficiaries who entered the gap, total drug costs were higher overall and decreased at year's end as out-of-pocket expenses increased. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer diabetes patients in this study entered the coverage gap than had been previously estimated, but the entry rate was much higher than that of the general Medicare Advantage Part D population. Patients entering the gap had lower subsequent monthly drug expenditures; this may be due to lower-than-expected drug prices and greater use of generics in managed care, or it may potentially signal poorer drug adherence. Future work should examine these hypotheses and explore risk factors for entering the Part D coverage gap. Authors: Schmittdiel Manag Care. 2009 Mar;15(3):189-93. Early adverse drug event signal detection within population-based health networks using sequential methods: key methodologic considerations PURPOSE: Active surveillance of population-based health networks may improve the timeliness of detection of adverse events (AEs). Our objective was to expand our previous signal detection work by investigating the effect on signal detection of alternative study specifications. METHODS: We compared the signal detection performance under various study specifications using historical data from nine health plans involved in the HMO Research Network's Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (CERT). Five drug-event pairs representing generally accepted associations with an AE and two pairs representing 'negative controls' were analyzed. Alternative study specifications related to the definition of incident users and incident AEs were assessed and compared to our previous findings. RESULTS: Relaxing the incident AE exclusion criteria by (1) including members with prior outpatient diagnoses of interest and (2) halving (to 90 days) the time window specified to define incident exposure and diagnoses increased the number of members under surveillance and as a consequence increased the number of exposed days and diagnoses by about 10-20%. The alternative specifications tend to result in earlier signal detection by 10-16 months, a likely consequence of more exposures and events entering the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides additional preliminary information related to conducting prospective safety monitoring using health plan data and sequential analytic methods. Our findings support continued investigation of using health plan data and sequential analytic methods as a potentially important contribution to active drug safety surveillance.

Medication errors among adults and children with cancer in the outpatient setting PURPOSE: Outpatients with cancer receive complicated medication regimens in the clinic and home. Medication errors in this setting are not well described. We aimed to determine rates and types of medication errors and systems factors associated with error in outpatients with cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records from visits to three adult and one pediatric oncology clinic in the Southeast, Southwest, Northeast, and Northwest for medication errors using established methods. Two physicians independently judged whether an error occurred (kappa = 0.65), identified its severity (kappa = 0.76), and listed possible interventions. RESULTS: Of 1,262 adult patient visits involving 10,995 medications, 7.1% (n = 90; 95% CI, 5.7% to 8.6%) were associated with a medication error. Of 117 pediatric visits involving 913 medications, 18.8% (n = 22; 95% CI, 12.5% to 26.9%) were associated with a medication error. Among all visits, 64 of the 112 errors had the potential to cause harm, and 15 errors resulted in injury. There was a range in the rates of chemotherapy errors (0.3 to 5.8 per 100 visits) and home medication errors (0 to 14.5 per 100 visits in children) at different sites. Errors most commonly occurred in administration (56%). Administration errors were often due to confusion over two sets of orders, one written at diagnosis and another adjusted dose on the day of administration. Physician reviewers selected improved communication most often to prevent error. CONCLUSION: Medication error rates are high among adult and pediatric outpatients with cancer. Our findings suggest some practical targets for intervention, including improved communication about medication administration in the clinic and home.

Increased risk of adverse neurological development for late preterm infants OBJECTIVE: To assess the risks of moderate prematurity for cerebral palsy (CP), developmental delay/mental retardation (DD/MR), and seizure disorders in early childhood. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using hospitalization and outpatient databases from the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program. Data covered 141 321 children or =30 weeks born between Jan 1, 2000, and June 30, 2004, with follow-up through June 30, 2005. Presence of CP, DD/MR, and seizures was based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes identified in the encounter data. Separate Cox proportional hazard models were used for each of the outcomes, with crude and adjusted hazard ratios calculated for each gestational age group. RESULTS: Decreasing gestational age was associated with increased incidence of CP and DD/MR, even for those born at 34 to 36 weeks gestation. Children born late preterm were 3 times as likely (hazard ratio, 3.39; 95% CI, 2.54-4.52) as children born at term to be diagnosed with CP. A modest association with DD/MR was found for children born at 34 to 36 weeks (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.54), but not for children in whom seizures were diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: Prematurity is associated with long-term neurodevelopmental consequences, with risks increasing as gestation decreases, even in infants born at 34 to 36 weeks.

Occupational exposure levels of bisphenol A among Chinese workers OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess ambient Bisphenol A (BPA) levels in workplaces and urine BPA levels of workers. METHODS: Workers in epoxy resin and BPA manufacturing factories were recruited. Personal samples for airborne BPA were taken in the workshops and spot urine samples were collected from workers before and after their shifts. The samples were assayed with high-performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector. TWA8 of airborne PBA in the workplaces and biological BPA burden of the workers were calculated. Correlations between the external and the internal exposure levels were sought. RESULTS: Workers from the factories were occupationally exposed to BPA at median personal airborne levels of 6.67 microg/m3 (or at the mean of 450 microg/m3). More than 90% of the workers who were occupationally exposed to BPA had detectable BPA levels in their blood samples. The medians of creatinine-adjusted urinary BPA levels were 84.6 microg/g Cr Cr pre- and post-shift (means of 4,630 microg/g Cr and 5,400 microg/g Cr), respectively. The urinary BPA concentration post-shift was significantly associated with the urinary BPA level pre-shift and personal airborne BPA levels. CONCLUSIONS: It was indicated that workers in epoxy resin and BPA manufacturing factories are occupationally exposed to BPA at high levels. There is an urgent need to create occupational standards and take effective preventive measures to protect workers from the potential adverse effects of BPA.

Perspectives from deductible plan enrollees: plan knowledge and anticipated care-seeking changes BACKGROUND: Consumer directed health care proposes that patients will engage as informed consumers of health care services by sharing in more of their medical costs, often through deductibles. We examined knowledge of deductible plan details among new enrollees, as well as anticipated care-seeking changes in response to the deductible. METHODS: In a large integrated delivery system with a range of deductible-based health plans which varied in services included or exempted from deductible, we conducted a mixed-method, cross-sectional telephone interview study. RESULTS: Among 458 adults newly enrolled in a deductible plan (71% response rate), 51% knew they had a deductible, 26% knew the deductible amount, and 6% knew which medical services were included or exempted from their deductible. After adjusting for respondent characteristics, those with more deductible-applicable services and those with lower self-reported health status were significantly more likely to know they had a deductible. Among those who knew of their deductible, half anticipated that it would cause them to delay or avoid medical care, including avoiding doctor's office visits and medical tests, even services that they believed were medically necessary. Many expressed concern about their costs, anticipating the inability to afford care and expressing the desire to change plans. CONCLUSION: Early in their experience with a deductible, patients had limited awareness of the deductible and little knowledge of the details. Many who knew of the deductible reported that it would cause them to delay or avoid seeking care and were concerned about their healthcare costs.

Using drink size to talk about drinking during pregnancy: a randomized clinical trial of Early Start Plus This clinical trial compared two brief alcohol use interventions in prenatal clinics: Early Start (ES), a substance-abuse screening and treatment program integrated with prenatal care focused on abstention (n=298), and Early Start Plus (ESP), adding a computerized drink-size assessment tool and intervention focused on drinking less (n=266). Controls were untreated alcohol users (n=344). Controls had higher adverse neonatal and maternal outcome rates. Findings favored ESP for preterm labor and ES for low birth weight. No differences between ES and ESP were statistically significant. ESP provides clinicians with an innovative assessment tool that creates open dialogue about drinking during pregnancy.

Differences in reproductive risk factors for breast cancer in middle-aged women in Marin County, California and a sociodemographically similar area of Northern California BACKGROUND: The Northern California county of Marin (MC) has historically had high breast cancer incidence rates. Because of MC's high socioeconomic status (SES) and racial homogeneity (non-Hispanic White), it has been difficult to assess whether these elevated rates result from a combination of established risk factors or other behavioral or environmental factors. This survey was designed to compare potential breast cancer risks and incidence rates for a sample of middle-aged MC women with those of a demographically similar population. METHODS: A random sample of 1500 middle-aged female members of a large Northern California health plan, half from Marin County (MC) and half from a comparison area in East/Central Contra Costa County (ECCC), were mailed a survey covering family history, reproductive history, use of oral contraceptives (OC) and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), behavioral health risks, recency of breast screening, and demographic characteristics. Weighted data were used to compare prevalence of individual breast cancer risk factors and Gail scores. Age-adjusted cumulative breast cancer incidence rates (2000-2004) were also calculated for female health plan members aged 40-64 residing in the two geographic areas. RESULTS: Survey response was 57.1% (n = 427) and 47.9% (n = 359) for MC and ECCC samples, respectively. Women in the two areas were similar in SES, race, obesity, exercise frequency, current smoking, ever use of OCs and HRT, age at onset of menarche, high mammography rates, family history of breast cancer, and Gail scores. However, MC women were significantly more likely than ECCC women to be former smokers (43.6% vs. 31.2%), have Ashkenazi Jewish heritage (12.8% vs. 7.1%), have no live births before age 30 (52.7% vs. 40.8%), and be nulliparous (29.2% vs. 15.4%), and less likely to never or rarely consume alcohol (34.4% vs. 41.9%). MC and ECCC women had comparable 2000-2004 invasive breast cancer incidence rates. CONCLUSION: The effects of reproductive risks factors, Ashkenazi Jewish heritage, smoking history, and alcohol consumption with regard to breast cancer risk in Marin County should be further evaluated. When possible, future comparisons of breast cancer incidence rates between regions should adjust for differences in income and education in addition to age and race/ethnicity, preferably by using a sociodemographically similar comparison Mar 25;9:6. Care coordination and electronic health records: connecting clinicians OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between use of electronic health records (EHR) and care coordination. STUDY DESIGN: Two surveys, in 2005 and again in 2006, of primary care clinicians working in a prepaid integrated delivery system during the staggered implementation of an EHR system. Using multivariate logistic regression to adjust for clinician characteristics, we examined the association between EHR use and clinicians' perceptions of three dimensions of care coordination: timely access to complete information; treatment goal agreement; and role/responsibility agreement. RESULTS: Compared to clinicians without EHR, clinicians with 6+ months of EHR use more frequently reported timely access to complete information, and being in agreement on treatment goals with other involved clinicians. There was no significant association between EHR use and being in agreement on roles and responsibilities with other clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: EHR use is associated with aspects of care coordination involving information transfer and communication of treatment goals. Authors: Graetz I; Reed Proc. 2009 Nov 14;2009:208-12. Racial differences in long-term adherence to oral antidiabetic drug therapy: a longitudinal cohort study BACKGROUND: Adherence to oral antidiabetic medications is often suboptimal. Adherence differences may contribute to health disparities for black diabetes patients, including higher microvascular event rates, greater complication-related disability, and earlier mortality. METHODS: In this longitudinal retrospective cohort study, we used 10 years of patient-level claims and electronic medical record data (1/1/1992-12/31/2001) to assess differences in short- and long-term adherence to oral antidiabetic medication among 1906 newly diagnosed adults with diabetes (26% black, 74% white) in a managed care setting in which all members have prescription drug coverage. Four main outcome measures included: (1) time from diabetes diagnosis until first prescription of oral antidiabetic medication; (2) primary adherence (time from first prescription to prescription fill); (3) time until discontinuation of oral antidiabetic medication from first prescription; and (4) long-term adherence (amount dispensed versus amount prescribed) over a 24-month follow-up from first oral antidiabetic medication prescription. RESULTS: Black patients were as likely as whites to initiate oral therapy and fill their first prescription, but experienced higher rates of medication discontinuation (HR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) and were less adherent over time. These black-white differences increased over the first six months of therapy but stabilized thereafter for patients who initiated on sulfonylureas. Significant black-white differences in adherence levels were constant throughout follow-up for patients initiated on metformin therapy. CONCLUSION: Racial differences in adherence to oral antidiabetic drug therapy persist even with equal access to medication. Early and continued emphasis on adherence from initiation of therapy may reduce persistent racial differences in medication use and clinical outcomes. Authors: 2009 Feb 7;9:24. Influence of patient costs and requests on emergency physician decisionmaking STUDY OBJECTIVES: We examine emergency physician knowledge of, attitudes about, and responses to patient cost-sharing in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: A convenience sample of emergency physicians from an integrated delivery system completed a questionnaire including self-report questions about knowledge of and attitudes about cost-sharing and an experimental vignette. The vignette describes a patient with an uncomplicated asthma exacerbation, with a version in which she has a $100 ED visit copayment and a version in which she does not. Subjects responded with their 'best judgment' of whether they would order a chest radiograph and their decision after specific patient request. We examined the frequency of responses overall and associated characteristics with chi(2) testing. RESULTS: Of 204 respondents (349 eligible participants [58%]), 203 answered the vignette questions. No respondent reported that ordering a radiograph was clinically appropriate; however, 85% reported that they would order a radiograph if the patient requested it. There were no significant differences in the percentage of physicians ordering the test across the 2 versions. Overall, 77% of respondents reported having limited awareness of an individual patient's cost-sharing level; 67% reported that patient costs sometimes affect their clinical decisions; only 10% estimated changing their decisions in greater than 20% of encounters in which the cost-sharing level was known. CONCLUSION: Emergency physicians are usually not aware of a patient's cost-sharing level and, in instances which they are, report that this knowledge rarely affects their clinical decisions. However, emergency physicians are responsive to patient requests, even when the treatment request differs from their clinical judgment.

Practice-linked online personal health records for type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled trial BACKGROUND: Web-based personal health records (PHRs) have been advocated as a means to improve type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) care. However, few Web-based systems are linked directly to the electronic medical record (EMR) used by physicians.METHODS: We randomized 11 primary care practices. Intervention practices received access to a DM-specific PHR that imported clinical and medications data, provided patient-tailored decision support, and enabled the patient to author a \"Diabetes Care Plan\" for electronic submission to their physician prior to upcoming appointments. Active control practices received a PHR to update and submit family history and health maintenance information. All patients attending these practices were encouraged to sign up for online access.RESULTS: We enrolled 244 patients with DM (37% of the eligible population with registered online access, 4% of the overall population of patients with DM). Study participants were younger (mean age, 56.1 years vs 60.3 years; P < .001) and lived in higher-income neighborhoods (median income, $53,784 vs $49,713; P < .001) but had similar baseline glycemic control compared with nonparticipants. More patients in the intervention arm had their DM treatment regimens adjusted (53% vs 15%; P < .001) compared with active controls. However, there were no significant differences in risk factor control between study arms after 1 year (P = .53).CONCLUSIONS: Previsit use of online PHR linked to the EMR increased rates of DM-related medication adjustment. Low rates of online patient account registration and good baseline control among participants limited the intervention's impact on overall risk factor control.

Natural history of severe ulcerative colitis in a community-based health plan BACKGROUND & AIMS: We sought to evaluate long-term outcomes of patients with severe ulcerative colitis (UC) after their first hospitalization for the disease. METHODS: A cohort of 656 patients hospitalized for UC during 1996 to 2004 was followed up for 9 years through 2004. Time-to-event was estimated using actuarial methods, and the proportions of those under follow-up evaluation who experienced outcomes at month 3, year 1, and year 5 were determined. Outcome measures studied were time to subsequent colectomy, rehospitalization for inflammatory bowel disease, and restarting steroid medication. We also used survival analysis to evaluate whether patient characteristics predicted the risk of rehospitalization and colectomy. RESULTS: Among 656 patients initially hospitalized for severe UC, 20% (N = 129) underwent colectomy during their initial hospitalization. Of the remaining 527, a total of 95% (N = 498) were discharged on a steroid taper. At 1 year after discharge, 29% of those remaining under observation were rehospitalized for UC, and an additional 10% required colectomy. At 1 and 5 years after discharge, 34% and 26% received at least a 90-day supply of steroid in the preceding 9 months. Risk of rehospitalization and colectomy were unrelated to the patient's age, sex, or race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: The risk for colectomy in patients hospitalized for the first time with severe UC is 20%. In the 3 months after hospitalization the risk for colectomy is 6%. After that, risks appear to decrease proportionate to the time since initial hospitalization. 2008 Sep;6(9):999-1003. Screening differences and risk of cervical cancer in inflammatory bowel disease BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer risk is high among immune suppressed women. AIM: To evaluate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with medications and risk of cervical cancer. METHODS: Members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), 15-68 years from 1996 to 2006 with IBD were compared with age-matched women without IBD. Cervical cancer was ascertained using the KPNC Cancer Registry. IBD medications of interest were aminosalicylates (ASA), corticosteroids, immune modulators and infliximab. Odds of cervical cancer were analysed with adjusted logistic regression. The prevalence of Pap smear testing was compared using a log binomial model. RESULTS: Ten cervical cancer cases occurred among 1165 women with IBD and 72 cancers among 12 124 controls. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of IBD with risk of cervical cancer was 1.45 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-2.84]. Medication ORs were 1.65 for ASA, 2.79 for corticosteroids and 3.45 for immune modulators (all P > 0.05). No cancer case used infliximab. The adjusted absolute increase in Pap smears among IBD women compared to women without IBD was 4% (95% CI 2-5%). CONCLUSIONS: Although a trend of elevated risk for cervical cancer with IBD and IBD medications was observed, it was not statistically significant. Regular cervical cancer screening for women with IBD is recommended. Authors: 28. Cardiology clinical trial participation in community-based healthcare systems: obstacles and opportunities BACKGROUND: The objective of our study was to examine cardiologists' and organizational leaders' interest in clinical trial participation and perceived barriers and facilitators to participation within ten diverse non-profit healthcare delivery systems. Trials play a pivotal role in advancing knowledge about the safety and efficacy of cardiovascular interventions and tests. Although cardiovascular trials successfully enroll patients, recruitment challenges persist. Community-based health systems could be an important source of participants and investigators, but little is known about community cardiologists' experiences with trials. METHODS: We interviewed 25 cardiology and administrative leaders and mailed questionnaires to all 280 cardiologists at 10 U.S. healthcare organizations. RESULTS: The survey received a 73% response rate. While 60% of respondents had not participated in any trials in the past year, nearly 75% wanted greater participation. Cardiologists reported positive attitudes toward trial participation; more than half agreed that trials were their first choice of therapy for patients, if available. Almost all leaders described their organizations as valuing research but not necessarily trials. Major barriers to participation were lack of physician time and insufficient skilled research nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiologists have considerable interest in trial participation. Major obstacles to increased participation are lack of time and effective infrastructure to support trials. These results suggest that community-based health systems are a rich source for cardiovascular research but additional funding and infrastructure are needed to leverage this 2008 Mar 4. Patterns of infliximab use among Crohn's disease patients in a community setting BACKGROUND: Information on infliximab use in a community setting is important to understand patterns of medication use and to anticipate and plan for costs associated with the drug. We sought to understand predictors of initiation and discontinuation of infliximab in the community-based setting of Kaiser Permanente, Northern California, which provides integrated care to its members. METHODS: The cohort study was set during 1998-2006. Predictors of initiation were assessed among 494 Crohn's disease (CD) patients who initiated infliximab and 2470 CD patients who did not initiate infliximab (controls). Data were obtained through linkage of computerized clinical information and were analyzed using logistic regression and Cox survival analysis. RESULTS: Infliximab infusions have increased rapidly since 2001, with no evidence of leveling off. Initiators were appreciably younger than controls (P < 0.001), but were similar to controls with respect to sex and race/ethnicity. The presence of at least 1 comorbidity was related to a modest increase in the risk of initiating (compared with none: 1 comorbidity, odds ratio [OR] = 1.52 with 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-2.00; 2 comorbidities, OR = 1.38 with CI 0.89-2.13). By 3 years after initiating, only 20% of patients remained on infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: In a community-based setting infliximab use has steadily increased. Age and comorbidity are associated with initiation, but sex and race/ethnicity are not. More information is needed to determine why, in this community-based setting, a large number of patients on infliximab discontinued their treatment.(Inflamm Dis. 2008 Sep;14(9):1265-72. Incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in a Northern California managed care organization, 1996-2002 OBJECTIVE: There are few estimates of the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in North American communities. We sought to estimate the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC), among 3.2 million members of Kaiser Permanente, Northern California, for the period 1996-2002. METHODS: All health plan members who had one or more diagnoses of CD (ICD-9 code 555) or UC (ICD-9 code 556) on computerized records during the period 1996-2002 and with at least 12 months of membership were identified as possible IBD cases (N = 12,059). We randomly sampled 24% of these for chart review to confirm the diagnosis and obtain the initial diagnosis date. Incidence rates and the point prevalence on December 31, 2002 were standardized to the 2000 U. S. Census. RESULTS: The annual incidence rate per 100,000 persons was 6.3 for CD (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-7.0) and 12.0 for UC (CI, 11.0-13.0). The point prevalence per 100,000 on December 31, 2002 was 96.3 for CD (95% CI, 89.6-103.0) and 155.8 for UC (95% CI, 146.6-164.9), increasing to 100.3 and 205.8 per 100,000, respectively, when hospital discharge data from 1985 to 1995 were included. The age-specific incidence of CD was bimodal, while UC incidence rose in early adulthood and remained elevated with advancing age. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence we estimated for CD was similar to the previous U. S. estimate. Our incidence estimate for UC was much higher than the previous U.S. estimate, but similar to that of recent Canadian and European studies. The prevalence we estimated for CD was somewhat lower than previous estimates. Authors: Herrinton LJ; Liu L; Lewis J Gastroenterol. 2008 Aug;103(8):1998-2006. Predictors of sustained walking among diabetes patients in managed care: the Translating Research into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) study BACKGROUND: Although patients with diabetes may benefit from physical activity, few studies have examined sustained walking in this population. OBJECTIVE: To examine the factors associated with sustained walking among managed care patients with diabetes. DESIGN: Longitudinal, observational cohort study with questionnaires administered 2.5 years apart. PARTICIPANTS: Five thousand nine hundred thirty-five patients with diabetes walking at least 20 minutes/day at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the likelihood of sustained walking, defined as walking at least 20 minutes/day at follow-up. We evaluated a logistic regression model that included demographic, clinical, and neighborhood variables as independent predictors of sustained walking, and expressed the results as predicted percentages. RESULTS: The absence of pain was linked to walking behavior, as 62% of patients with new pain, 67% with ongoing pain, and 70% without pain were still walking at follow-up (p = .03). Obese patients were less likely (65%) to sustain walking than overweight (71%) or normal weight (70%) patients (p = .03). Patients > or =65 years (63%) were less likely to sustain walking than patients between 45 and 64 (70%) or < or =44 (73%) years (p = .04). Only 62% of patients with a new comorbidity sustained walking compared with 68% of those who did not (p < .001). We found no association between any neighborhood variables and sustained walking in this cohort of active walkers. CONCLUSIONS: Pain, obesity, and new comorbidities were moderately associated with decreases in sustained walking. Whereas controlled intervention studies are needed, prevention, or treatment of these adverse conditions may help patients with diabetes sustain walking behavior.

Risk factors for severe hyperbilirubinemia among infants with borderline bilirubin levels: a nested case-control study OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of phototherapy and other predictors on the risk of total serum bilirubin (TSB) >or= 25 mg/dL in infants with a TSB of 17 to 22.9 mg/dL at age >or= 48 hours. STUDY DESIGN: From a cohort of 285295 infants >or= 34 weeks gestation and >or= 2000 g born between 1995 and 2004 in northern California Kaiser hospitals, we identified 17986 with a TSB of 17 to 22.9 mg/dL at age >or= 48 hours. All infants exhibiting a TSB >or= 25 mg/dL were selected as cases for the study. Four randomly selected controls were matched to each case based on the difference between their qualifying TSB and the American Academy of Pediatrics' phototherapy threshold. RESULTS: A total of 62 cases were identified (0.4%). Six of these (10%) received inpatient phototherapy within 8 hours, along with 101 controls (41%) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06 to 0.40). often had lower gestational age (AOR 3.24; 95% CI 1.24 to 8.47 for 38 to 39 weeks and AOR = 3.70; 95% CI 0.61 to 22.4 for 34 to 37 weeks compared with >or= 40-week infants), bruising, (AOR CI 1.05 in preventing TSB >or= mg/dL. The strongest predictors of TSB >or= 25 mg/dL were gestational age, bruising, family history, and rapid rise in TSB. 2008 Mar 21. The health-related quality of life in long-term colorectal cancer survivors study: objectives, methods and patient sample OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to describe the complex mixed-methods design of a study conducted to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes and ostomy-related obstacles and adjustments among long-term (>5 years) colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors with ostomies (cases) and without ostomies (controls). In addition, details are provided regarding the study sample and the psychometric properties of the quantitative data collection measures used. Subsequent manuscripts will present the study findings. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study design involved a cross-sectional mail survey for collecting quantitative data and focus groups for collecting qualitative data. The study subjects were individuals identified as long-term CRC survivors within a community-based health maintenance organization's enrolled population. Focus groups comprised of cases were conducted. The groups were divided by gender and HRQOL high and low quartile contrasts (based on the mail survey data). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The modified City of Hope Quality of Life (mCOH-QOL)-Ostomy and SF-36v2 questionnaires were used in the mail survey. An abridged version of the mCOH-QOL-Ostomy was used for the control subjects. Focus groups explored ostomy-related barriers to self-care, adaptation methods/skills, and advice for others with an ostomy. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 52% (679/1308) and 34 subjects participated in focus groups. The internal consistency reliability estimates for the mCOH-QOL-Ostomy and SF-36v2 questionnaires were very acceptable for group comparisons. In addition, evidence supports the construct validity of the abridged version of the mCOH-QOL-Ostomy. Study limitations include potential non-response bias and limited minority participation. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to successfully recruit long-term CRC survivors into this study and the psychometric properties of the quantitative measures used were quite acceptable. Mixed-methods designs, such as the one used in this study, may be useful in identification and further elucidation of common problems, coping strategies, and HRQOL outcomes among Epub 2008 Jun 9. Gastroenterologists' attitudes and self-reported practices regarding inflammatory bowel disease BACKGROUND: The purpose was to assess organization-, physician-, and patient-based aspects of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) practice variation within an integrated care delivery system and the extent to which physicians are interested in adopting a chronic care model and/or nurse assistance to manage IBD patients. METHODS: As part of an observational cohort study to understand variation in IBD care and outcomes, we conducted semistructured, open-ended interviews with 17 gastroenterologists and 1 gastroenterology registered nurse at 6 clinics in an integrated care delivery system. Interviews were taperecorded and transcribed. We coded and analyzed transcripts using standard qualitative methods. RESULTS: Physicians reported a range of attitudes and practices regarding IBD. Analysis showed differences in 3 domains and 8 subdomains: 1) patient education and choices, including health education and patient use of complementary and alternative medicine; 2) decisions about diagnosis and treatment, including practice guidelines, conferring with colleagues, using infliximab, and medical hospitalization; and 3) organizational aspects of care, including primary care involvement with IBD and MD attitudes toward ancillary support. CONCLUSIONS: Standardized algorithms on care for IBD patients do not exist, but opportunities may exist to improve IBD care by: having initial work-ups and management of patients in remission in primary care; creating and maintaining opportunities for gastroenterologists to confer with colleagues and acknowledged local experts; and having nurse coordination for medications and labs and/or some type of specialty IBD clinic for high-need patients. This research highlights the need for more directed comparative efficacy and effectiveness trials that will serve to define preferred treatment strategies. Authors: When more is not better: treatment intensification among hypertensive patients with poor medication adherence BACKGROUND: Hypertension may be poorly controlled because patients do not take their medications (poor adherence) or because providers do not increase medication when appropriate (lack of medication intensification, or 'clinical inertia'). We examined the prevalence of and relationship between patient adherence and provider treatment intensification. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a retrospective cohort study of hypertensive patients who had filled prescriptions for 1 or more blood pressure (BP) medications at Veterans' Affairs (VA) healthcare facilities in a Midwestern VA administrative region. Our sample included all patients who received at least 2 outpatient BP medication refills during 2004 and had 1 or more outpatient primary care visits with an elevated systolic BP >140 but <200 mm Hg or diastolic BP >90 mm Hg during 2005 (n=38,327). For each episode of elevated BP during 2005 (68,610 events), we used electronic pharmacy refill data to examine patients' BP medication adherence over the prior 12 months and whether providers increased doses or added BP medications ('intensification'). Multivariate analyses accounted for the clustering of elevated BP events within patients and adjusted for patient age, comorbidities, number of BP medications, encounter systolic BP, and average systolic BP over the prior year. Providers intensified medications in 30% of the 68,610 elevated BP events, with almost no variation in intensification regardless of whether patients had good or poor BP medication adherence. After adjustment, intensification rates were 31% among patients who had 'gaps' of <20% (days on which patients should have had medication but no medication was available because medications had not been refilled), 34% among patients with refill gaps of 20% to 59%, and 32% among patients with gaps of 60% or more. CONCLUSIONS: Intensification of medications occurred in fewer than one third of visits in which patients had an elevated BP. Patients' prior medication adherence had little impact on providers' decisions about intensifying medications, even at very high levels of poor adherence. Addressing both patient adherence and provider intensification simultaneously would most likely result in better BP control. 3;117(22):2884-92. Epub 2008 May 27. Factors influencing parental satisfaction with neonatal intensive care among the families of moderately premature infants OBJECTIVE: The goal was to examine the factors influencing parental satisfaction with neonatal intensive care for moderately premature infants in 10 hospitals in Massachusetts and California. METHODS: A total of 677 infants without major anomalies or chromosomal disorders who were born between 30 and 34 weeks of gestation in the participating hospitals and discharged alive were included. Parental satisfaction with neonatal intensive care was ascertained 3 months after discharge by using a previously developed scale of 12 Likert items (scored 1-5), addressing such issues as perceptions regarding the staff providing emotional support, information, or education. The questionnaire, which was administered by telephone, also included parental ratings of child health and reports of subsequent health care use, sociodemographic characteristics, and history of infertility treatment. Data on the prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal course were abstracted from the medical charts, and the factors associated with parental satisfaction were analyzed. RESULTS: Parental satisfaction with neonatal intensive care varied significantly across the 10 hospitals. The major predictors of satisfaction were sociodemographic characteristics, history of infertility treatment, and especially parental ratings of child health 3 months after discharge, rather than aspects of the perinatal or neonatal course. Controlling for these factors, differences across hospitals were not statistically significant. However, the variance explained by all of the measured factors, including child health rating, was modest (19%). CONCLUSIONS: Although we included variables across the full spectrum of neonatal intensive care, we found that the major predictor of parental satisfaction with neonatal intensive care was child health at the time of the interview, followed by sociodemographic factors and previous infertility treatment. However, the variance explained was limited, which suggests that research is needed on the factors influencing satisfaction.

Medication adherence and racial differences in A1C control OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine medication adherence and other self-management practices as potential determinants of higher glycemic risk among black relative to white patients.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a retrospective, longitudinal repeated-measures design to model the contribution of medication adherence to black-white differences in A1C among type 2 diabetic patients at a large multispecialty group practice. We identified 1,806 adult (aged >/=18 at diagnosis) patients (467 black and 1,339 white) with newly initiated oral hypoglycemic therapy between 1 December 1994 and 31 December 2000. Race was identified using an electronic medical record and patient self-report. Baseline was defined as the 13 months preceding and included the month of therapy initiation. All patients were required to have at least 12 months of follow-up.RESULTS: At initiation of therapy, black patients had higher average A1C values compared with whites (9.8 vs. 8.9, a difference of 0.88; P < 0.0001). Blacks had lower average medication adherence during the first year of therapy (72 vs. 78%; P < 0.0001). Although more frequent medication refills were associated with lower average A1C values, adjustment for adherence did not eliminate the black-white gap.CONCLUSIONS: We found persistent racial differences in A1C that were not explained by differences in medication adherence. Our findings suggest that targeting medication adherence alone is unlikely to reduce disparities in glycemic control in this setting. Further research is needed to explore possible genetic and environmental determinants of higher A1C among blacks at diagnosis, which may represent a critical period for more intensive intervention..

Poor adherence versus lack of treatment intensification BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of effective hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia therapies, target levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c), and hemoglobin A1c control are often not achieved. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relative importance of patient medication nonadherence versus clinician lack of therapy intensification in explaining above target cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor levels. DESIGN: Cross-sectional assessment. PARTICIPANTS: In 2005, 161,697 Kaiser Permanente Northern California adult diabetes patients were included in the study. MEASUREMENT: 'Above target' was defined mmHg for hypertension. Poor adherence was defined as medication gaps for >/=20% of days covered for all medications for each condition separately. Treatment intensification was defined as an increase in the number of drug classes, increased dosage of a class, or a switch to a different class within the 3 months before or after notation of above target levels. RESULTS: Poor adherence was found in 20-23% of patients across the 3 conditions. No evidence of poor adherence with no treatment intensification was found in 30% of hyperglycemia patients, 47% of hyperlipidemia patients, and 36% of hypertension patients. Poor adherence or lack of therapy intensification was evident in 53-68% of patients above target levels across conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Both nonadherence and lack of treatment intensification occur frequently in patients above target for CVD risk factor levels; however, lack of therapy intensification was somewhat more common. Quality improvement efforts should focus on these modifiable barriers to CVD Epub 2008 Mar 4. Cost-related medication nonadherence and spending on basic needs following implementation of Medicare Part D CONTEXT: Cost-related medication nonadherence (CRN) has been a persistent problem for individuals who are elderly and disabled in the United States. The impact of Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D) on CRN is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To estimate changes in CRN and forgoing basic needs to pay for drugs following Part D implementation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a population-level study design, changes in study outcomes between 2005 and 2006 before and after Medicare Part D implementation were compared with historical changes between 2004 and 2005. The community-dwelling sample of the nationally representative Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (unweighted unique n = 24,234; response rate, 72.3%) was used, and logistic regression analyses were controlled for demographic characteristics, health status, and historical trends. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reports of CRN (skipping or reducing doses, not obtaining prescriptions) and spending less on basic needs to afford medicines. RESULTS: The unadjusted, weighted prevalence of CRN was 15.2% in 2004, 14.1% in 2005, and 11.5% after Part D implementation in 2006. The prevalence of spending less on basic needs was 10.6% in 2004, 11.1% in 2005, and 7.6% in 2006. Adjusted analyses comparing 2006 with 2005 and controlling for historical changes (2005 vs 2004) demonstrated significant decreases in the odds of CRN (ratio of odds ratios [ORs], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-0.98; P = .03) and spending less on basic needs (ratio of ORs, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.48-0.72; P .001). No significant changes in CRN were observed among beneficiaries with fair to poor health (ratio of ORs, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82-1.21; P = .97), despite high baseline CRN prevalence for this group (22.2% in 2005) and significant decreases among beneficiaries with good to excellent health (ratio of ORs, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95; P = .02). However, significant reductions in spending less on basic needs were observed in both groups (fair to poor health: ratio of ORs, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.75; P .001; and good to excellent health: ratio of ORs, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44-0.75; P .001). CONCLUSIONS: In this survey population, there was evidence for a small but significant overall decrease in CRN and forgoing basic needs following Part D implementation. However, no net decrease in CRN after Part D was observed among the sickest beneficiaries, who continued to experience higher rates of CRN. Authors: Madden Office visit copayments: patient knowledge, response, and communication with providers BACKGROUND: There is limited information on patients' knowledge about their cost-sharing requirements and how that influenced their care-seeking behavior. OBJECTIVE: To examine patients' knowledge of their office visit copayments, their self-reported responses to perceived and actual copayments, and discussions with physicians about costs. RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone interview study with a 71% response rate. SUBJECTS: Stratified random sample of 479 adult members of a prepaid, integrated delivery system: equal sample of members with and without a chronic disease. MEASURES: Perceived and actual office visit copayment amounts, patient self-reported behavioral responses to copayments, cost discussions with a physician, and patient attitudes about discussing costs. RESULTS: Overall, 50% of respondents correctly reported their copayment amount, with 39% underestimating and 11% overestimating. Among respondents who reported having copayments, 27% reported delaying or avoiding a visit altogether, or talking to a physician/advice nurse instead of attending an in-person visit because of their copayment. Perceived office visit copayment amounts were significantly associated with self-reported behavior changes (OR, 1.47 per $10; 95% CI, 1.06-2.05). Only 4% of respondents reported talking with their physician about their costs, with 79% believing that their providers cannot help them with their costs, and 51% believing that it is inappropriate to discuss costs with their physician. CONCLUSIONS: Patients have limited knowledge of their office visit copayment amounts, and are changing their care-seeking behavior in response to perceived costs. Moreover, most patients are making these changes without discussing their cost concerns with their physician.

Coping with prescription drug cost sharing: knowledge, adherence, and financial burden OBJECTIVE: Assess patient knowledge of and response to drug cost sharing. STUDY SETTING: Adult members of a large prepaid, integrated delivery system. STUDY DESIGN/DATA COLLECTION: Telephone interviews with 932 participants (72 percent response rate) who reported knowledge of the structures and amounts of their prescription drug cost sharing. Participants reported cost-related changes in their drug adherence, any financial burden, and other cost-coping behaviors. Actual cost sharing amounts came from administrative databases. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Overall, 27 percent of patients knew all of their drug cost sharing structures and amounts. After adjustment for individual characteristics, additional patient cost sharing structures (tiers and caps), and higher copayment amounts were associated with reporting decreased adherence, financial burden, or other cost-coping behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Patient knowledge of their drug benefits is limited, especially for more complex cost sharing structures. Patients also report a range of responses to greater cost sharing, including decreasing adherence. Authors: Reed M; Brand R; Newhouse JP; Apr;43(2):785-97. Risk-adjusting hospital inpatient mortality using automated inpatient, outpatient, and laboratory databases OBJECTIVES: To develop a risk-adjustment methodology that maximizes the use of automated physiology and diagnosis data from the time period preceding hospitalization. DESIGN: : Retrospective cohort study using split-validation and logistic regression. SETTING: Seventeen hospitals in a large integrated health care delivery system. SUBJECTS: Patients (n = 259,699) hospitalized between January 2002 and June 2005. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inpatient and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Inpatient mortality was 3.50%; 30-day mortality was 4.06%. We tested logistic regression models in a randomly chosen derivation dataset consisting of 50% of the records and applied their coefficients to the validation dataset. The final model included sex, age, admission type, admission diagnosis, a Laboratory-based Acute Physiology Score (LAPS), and a COmorbidity Point Score (COPS). The LAPS integrates information from 14 laboratory tests obtained in the 24 hours preceding hospitalization into a single continuous variable. Using Diagnostic Cost Groups software, we categorized patients as having up to 40 different comorbidities based on outpatient and inpatient data from the 12 months preceding hospitalization. The COPS integrates information regarding these 41 comorbidities into a single continuous variable. Our best model for inpatient mortality had a c statistic of 0.88 in the validation dataset, whereas the c statistic for 30-day mortality was 0.86; both models had excellent calibration. Physiologic data accounted for a substantial proportion of the model's predictive ability. CONCLUSION: Efforts to support improvement of hospital outcomes can take advantage of risk-adjustment methods based on automated physiology and diagnosis data that are not confounded by information obtained after hospital admission.

Risk adjusting community-acquired pneumonia hospital outcomes using automated databases OBJECTIVE: To describe the development and assessment of the Abbreviated Fine Severity Score (AFSS), a simplified version of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) suitable for providing risk-adjusted reports to clinicians caring for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: We defined the AFSS based on data available in administrative and laboratory databases. We downloaded and linked these hospitalization and laboratory data from 2 cohorts (11,030 patients and 6147 patients) hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia in all Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program hospitals in northern California. We then assessed the relationship between the AFSS and mortality, length of stay, intensive care unit admission, and the use of assisted ventilation. Using logistic regression analysis, we assessed the performance of the AFSS and determined the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (c statistic). Using a combination of manual and electronic medical record review, we compared the AFSS with the full PSI in 2 subsets of patients in northern California and Denver, Colorado, whose medical records were manually reviewed. RESULTS: The AFSS compares favorably with the PSI with respect to predicting mortality. It has good discrimination with respect to inhospital (c = 0.74) and 30-day (c = 0.75) mortality. It also correlates strongly with the PSI (r = 0.87 and r = 0.93 in the 2 medical record review subsets). CONCLUSIONS: The AFSS can be used to provide clinically relevant risk-adjusted outcomes reports to clinicians in an integrated healthcare delivery system. It is possible to apply risk-adjustment methods from research settings to operational ones. Authors: Escobar GJ; Fireman J Manag Care. 2008 Mar;14(3):158-66. Diffusion of aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer therapy between 1996 and 2003 in the Cancer Research Network PURPOSE: Clinical trials demonstrated adjuvant aromatase inhibitor treatment is superior for decreasing breast cancer recurrence risk over adjuvant tamoxifen treatment as early as 2001. Yet clinical use for adjuvant treatment was not recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology until 2004. Aromatase inhibitor uptake after the first public presentation of randomized trial results but before the release of national guidelines is unclear. We evaluated diffusion of aromatase inhibitor dispensings for breast cancer treatment in integrated healthcare delivery systems across the United States. METHODS: We collected automated data for 13,245 women enrolled at seven integrated healthcare delivery systems in the Cancer Research Network. All women were aged >55 and diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive, invasive breast cancer between 1996 and 2003. We used electronic pharmacy data to identify aromatase inhibitor and tamoxifen dispensings through 2004. We evaluated the proportions of women who received hormone dispensings in two ways: (1) at any point after diagnosis to capture all use, and (2) in the two-year period following diagnosis to approximate adjuvant use. RESULTS: Over time, adjuvant aromatase inhibitor use increased whereas tamoxifen use decreased. Aromatase inhibitor dispensings within 2 years of diagnosis increased from 4.1% among women diagnosed in 2000 to 13% in 2001, 24% in 2002, and 40% in 2003. Tamoxifen use declined starting in 2001 at every system. CONCLUSION: Aromatase inhibitor use rose dramatically after 2001 while tamoxifen use decreased. It appears results from early clinical trials changed practice in these integrated healthcare systems before formal changes in national guidelines. Authors: Aiello EJ; Haque R; Geiger AM; et al.

Perception of neighborhood problems, health behaviors, and diabetes outcomes among adults with diabetes in managed care: the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) study OBJECTIVE: Recent data suggest that residential environment may influence health behaviors and outcomes. We assessed whether perception of neighborhood problems was associated with diabetes behaviors and outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis included 7,830 diabetic adults enrolled in Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes, a study of diabetes care and outcomes in managed care settings. Perception of neighborhood problems was measured using a summary score of participants' ratings of crime, trash, litter, lighting at night, and access to exercise facilities, transportation, and supermarkets. Outcomes included health behaviors and clinical outcomes. Hierarchical regression models were used to account for clustering of patients within neighborhoods and to adjust for objective neighborhood socioeconomic status (percentage living in poverty) and potential individual-level confounders (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, comorbidity index, and duration of diabetes). RESULTS: After adjustment, residents of neighborhoods in the lowest tertile (most perceived problems) reported higher rates of current smoking (15 vs. 11%) than those in the highest tertile and had slightly lower participation in any weekly physical activity (95 vs. 96%). In addition, their blood pressure control was worse (25 vs. 31% <130/80 mmHg), and their Short Form 12 scores were slightly lower (44 vs. 46 units for emotional well-being and 43 vs. 44 units for physical well-being); all P < 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood problems were most strongly associated with more smoking and higher blood pressure, both of which have significant implications for cardiovascular risk. Potential mechanisms that explain these associations should be further explored in longitudinal studies. Authors: 2007 Nov 13. Race/ethnicity and economic differences in cost-related medication underuse among insured adults with diabetes: the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes Study OBJECTIVE: To examine racial/ethnic and economic variation in cost-related medication underuse among insured adults with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We surveyed 5,086 participants from the multicenter Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes Study. Respondents reported whether they used less medication because of cost in the past 12 months. We examined unadjusted and adjusted rates of cost-related medication underuse, using hierarchical regression, to determine whether race/ethnicity differences still existed after accounting for economic, health, and other demographic variables. RESULTS: Participants were 48% white, 14% African American, 14% Latino, Asian/Pacific 8% other. Overall, 14% reported cost-related medication underuse. Unadjusted rates were highest for Latinos (23%) and African Americans (17%) compared with whites (13%), Islanders (11%), and others In multivariate significantly predicted cost-related medication underuse (P = 0.048). However, adjusted rates were only slightly higher for Latinos (14%) than whites (10%) (P = 0.026) and were not significantly different for African Americans (11%), Asian/Pacific Islanders (7%), and others (11%). Income and out-of-pocket drug costs showed the greatest differences in adjusted rates of cost-related medication underuse (15 vs. 5% for Tseng CW; Karter CM; et Authors: Tseng CW; et al.

Educational disparities in rates of smoking among diabetic adults: the translating research into action for diabetes study OBJECTIVES: We assessed educational disparities in smoking rates among adults with diabetes in managed care settings. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional, survey-based (2002-2003) observational study among 6538 diabetic patients older than 25 years across multiple managed care health plans and states. For smoking at each level of self-reported educational attainment, predicted probabilities were estimated by means of hierarchical logistic regression models with random intercepts for health plan, adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Overall, 15% the participants reported current smoking. An educational gradient in smoking was observed that varied significantly (P<.003) across age groups, with the educational gradient being strong in those aged 25 to 44 years, modest in those aged 45 to 64 years, and nonexistent in those aged 65 years or older. Of particular note, the prevalence of smoking observed in adults aged 25-44 years with less than a high school education was 50% (95% confidence interval: 36% to 63%). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of poorly educated young adults with diabetes smoke, magnifying the health risk associated with early-onset diabetes. Targeted public health interventions for smoking prevention and cessation among young, poorly educated people with diabetes are needed. Authors: Karter AJ; Ettner SL; et al.

Positive, negative, and disparate-women's differing long-term psychosocial experiences of bilateral or contralateral prophylactic mastectomy Because of recent studies showing strong prevention benefit and acceptable psychosocial outcomes, more women may be considering prophylactic mastectomy. A growing literature shows some positive psychosocial outcomes for women with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, but less is known about women with contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Several surveys have shown that a large majority of women with prophylactic mastectomy report satisfaction with their decisions to have the procedure when asked in a quantitative, closed-ended format. We sought to explore the nuances of women's satisfaction with the procedure using a qualitative, open-ended format. We included open-ended questions as part of a mailed survey on psychosocial outcomes of prophylactic mastectomy. The research team coded and analyzed these responses using qualitative methods. We used simple descriptive statistics to compare the demographics of the entire survey sample to those women who answered the open-ended questions; the responses to the open- and closed-ended satisfaction questions, and the responses of women with bilateral and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Seventy-one percent of women with prophylactic mastectomy responded to the survey and 48% provided open-ended responses about psychosocial outcomes. Women's open-ended responses regarding psychosocial outcomes could be coded into one of three general categories-positive, negative, and disparate. In the subgroup of women with both open- and closed-ended responses, over 70% of women providing negative and disparate comments to the open-ended question simultaneously indicated satisfaction on a closed-ended question. Negative and disparate open-ended responses were twice as common among women with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (52%) than women with contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (26%). These findings suggest that even among women who report general satisfaction with their decision to have prophylactic mastectomy via closed-ended survey questions, lingering negative psychosocial outcomes can remain, particularly among women with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. This dichotomy could be an important factor to discuss in counseling women considering the procedure. Geiger J. 2008 Jan-Feb;14(1):25-32. Race/ethnicity and validity of self-reported pneumococcal vaccination BACKGROUND: National and state surveys show large disparities in pneumococcal vaccination status among Whites, Blacks and Latinos aged >/= 65. The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is any difference in the validity of self-report for pneumococcal vaccination by race/ethnicity that might contribute to the substantial disparities observed in population-level coverage estimates. METHODS: Self-reported vaccination status was compared with medical record documentation for samples of White, Black, and Latino members of a large health plan to examine whether differences in validity of self-report contribute to observed disparities. RESULTS: Sensitivity was significantly lower for Blacks (0.849, 95% CI 0.818-0.876) and Whites (0.931 95% CI 0.918-0.942). Specificity was somewhat higher for Blacks than for Latinos and Whites, but the differences were not statistically significant. Coverage for Whites, Blacks and Latinos, respectively, was 84.3%, 73.5%, and 82.3% based on self-report, 74.8%, 71.9%, and 84.2% based on medical records. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that differential self-report error, i.e., summative effect of over-reporting and under-reporting within a race-ethnic group, may contribute to the size and direction of race-ethnic disparities in pneumococcal vaccination observed in Jul 3;8:227. Health-related characteristics and preferred methods of receiving health education according to dominant language among Latinos aged 25 to 64 in a large Northern California health plan BACKGROUND: Latinos are a fast growing segment of the U.S. health care population. Acculturation factors, including English fluency, result in an ethnic group heterogeneous with regard to SES, health practices, and health education needs. This study examined how demographic and health-related characteristics of Spanish-dominant (SD), Bilingual (BIL), and English-dominant (ED) Latino men and women aged 25-64 differed among members of a large Northern California health plan. METHODS: This observational study was based on data from cohorts of 171 SD (requiring an interpreter), 181 BIL, and 734 ED Latinos aged 25-64 who responded to random sample health plan member surveys conducted 2005-2006. Language groups were compared separately by gender on education, income, behavioral health risks (smoking, obesity, exercise frequency, dietary practices, health beliefs), health status (overall health and emotional health, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, heartburn/acid reflux, back pain, depression), computer and Internet access, and health education modality preferences. RESULTS: Compared with ED Latinos, higher percentages of the SD and BIL groups had very low educational attainment and low income. While groups were similar in prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol, SD were less likely than ED Latinos to rate overall health and emotional well-being as good, very good, or excellent and more likely to report heartburn and back pain (women only). The groups were similar with regard to smoking and obesity, but among women, SD were more likely to be physically inactive than ED, and BIL were less likely than SD and ED groups to eat <3 servings of fruit/vegetables per day. SD and BIL of both genders were significantly less likely than ED Latinos to believe that health practices had a large impact on health. Compared to ED men and women, SD and BIL Latinos had significantly lower Internet and computer access. As a result, SD Latinos had a greater preference for lower technology health education modalities such as videos and taped phone messages. CONCLUSION: There are important differences among Latinos of different English language proficiency with regard to education, income, health status, health behaviors, IT access, and health education modality preferences that ought to be considered when planning and implementing health programs for this growing segment of the U.S. population.

Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) and improved patient-centered outcomes for chronic conditions BACKGROUND: The Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) has potential for use as a patient-centered measure of the implementation of the Chronic Care Model (CCM), but there is little research on the relationship between the PACIC and important behavioral and quality measures for patients with chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between PACIC scores and self-management behaviors, patient rating of their health care, and self-reported quality of life. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey with a 61% response rate. PARTICIPANTS: Included in the survey were 4,108 adults with diabetes, chronic pain, heart failure, asthma, or coronary artery disease in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care program across 7 regions nationally. MEASUREMENTS: The PACIC was the main independent variable. Dependent variables included use of self-management resources, self-management behaviors such as regular exercise, self-reported adherence to medications, patient rating of their health care, and quality of life. RESULTS: PACIC scores were significantly, positively associated with all measures (odds ratio [ORs] ranging from 1.20 to 2.36) with the exception of self-reported medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the PACIC, a practical, patient-level assessment of CCM implementation, could be an important tool for health systems and other stakeholders looking to improve the quality of chronic disease care.

Early detection of adverse drug events within population-based health networks: application of sequential testing methods PURPOSE: Active surveillance of population-based health networks may improve the timeliness of detection of adverse drug events (ADEs). Active monitoring requires sequential analysis methods. Our objectives were to (1) evaluate the utility of automated healthcare claims data for near real-time drug adverse event surveillance and (2) identify key methodological issues related to the use of healthcare claims data for real-time drug safety surveillance. METHODS: We assessed the ability to detect ADEs using historical data from nine health plans involved in the HMO Research Network's Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (CERT). Analyses were performed using a maximized sequential probability ratio test (maxSPRT). Five drug-event pairs representing known associations with an ADE and two pairs representing 'negative controls' were analyzed. RESULTS: Statistically significant (p < 0.05) signals of excess risk were found in four of the five drug-event pairs representing known associations; no signals were found for the negative controls. Signals were detected between 13 and 39 months after the start of surveillance. There was substantial variation in the number of exposed and expected events at signal detection. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective, periodic evaluation of routinely collected data can provide population-based estimates of medication-related adverse event rates to support routine, timely post-marketing surveillance for selected ADEs.

Understanding the gap between good processes of diabetes care and poor intermediate outcomes: Translating Research into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) BACKGROUND: Performance of diabetes clinical care processes has improved recently, but control of hemoglobin A1c (A1c) and other vascular disease risk factors has improved more slowly. OBJECTIVES: To identify patient factors associated with control of vascular disease risk factors among diabetes patients receiving recommended care processes. POPULATION: Managed care enrollees who participated in the TRIAD (Translating Research into Action for Diabetes) Study and received at least 5 of 7 recommended care processes during the 12 months before the second survey (2002-2003). METHODS: Comparison of 1003 patients with good control of A1c (<8%), systolic blood pressure (<140 mm Hg) and LDL-cholesterol (<130 mg/dL) versus 812 patients with poor control for at least 2 of these factors. RESULTS: Poorly controlled patients were younger, more frequently female, African American, with lower education and income (P < 0.001 for each). General health status was lower, body mass index higher, and insulin treatment more frequent; history of prior coronary heart disease was less frequent. They were more likely to indicate depression and hopelessness and to identify costs as a barrier to self-care; less likely to report trust in their regular physician; and more likely to smoke cigarettes and be physically inactive. Adjusting for demographic and clinical variables, concerns about costs, low trust in one's physician, current smoking, and physical inactivity remained associated with poor control. However, inclusion of these 4 variables in a single model did not diminish associations of race/ethnicity or education with control. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and behavioral factors were independently associated with poor control. However, these factors did not fully explain observed racial and socioeconomic disparities in control. Authors: Selby JV; Karter AJ; Ferrara al. Med Care. 2007 Dec;45(12):1144-53. Racial differences in the use of respiratory medications in premature infants after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of race and ethnicity on the use of oral beta-agonists, inhaled beta-agonists, and inhaled corticosteroids to treat respiratory symptoms in former premature infants after controlling for medical conditions, socioeconomic status, and site of outpatient care. STUDY DESIGN: Using a population cohort of infants born at a gestational age or = 34 weeks at 5 Northern California Kaiser Permanente hospitals between 1998 and 2001 (n = 1436), we constructed multivariable models to determine predictive factors for the receipt of respiratory medications during the first year after discharge. RESULTS: After controlling for confounding factors, black infants were more likely to receive oral beta-agonists compared with white infants (OR 4.30, 95% CI 2.33-7.94), and Hispanic infants were less likely to receive inhaled beta-agonists (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.99) or inhaled corticosteroids (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.67). These findings were not explained by more outpatient visits for respiratory symptoms in black or Hispanic infants, because the observed racial differences persisted when children of similar respiratory symptoms were examined. CONCLUSIONS: Even in a high-risk population of insured infants, substantial racial differences persist in the use of respiratory medications that could not be explained by differences in respiratory symptoms.

Mortality by medication use among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 1996-2003 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Most previous population-based studies of mortality in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) did not account for medication use. We evaluated mortality by IBD medication use among members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California IBD Registry. METHODS: The retrospective, population-based cohort study included 9032 persons who received at least one inpatient or 2 outpatient diagnoses of IBD during 1996-2002. Age and sex standardized mortality ratios measured the associations between IBD and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Age, sex, and smoking adjusted odds ratios measured the association of mortality by IBD medication use. RESULTS: Compared with health plan members without IBD, mortality was increased in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) (1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.6) but not ulcerative colitis (UC) (1.0; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2). CD was associated with increased mortality from infectious and parasitic diseases (4.1; 95% CI, 1.7-8.5), liver diseases (2.6; 95% CI, 1.0-5.3). UC was associated with increased mortality from digestive diseases other than IBD (3.9; 95% CI, 2.4-6.0). The relationship with CD mortality was 0.7 for aminosalicylates (95% CI, 0.5-1.1), 1.3 (95% CI, 1.0 (95% CI, 0.7-1.4) for corticosteroids. Among patients with UC, these odds ratios were 0.8 (95% CI, 0.5-1.1) for aminosalicylates, 0.5 (95% CI, (95% CI, 0.6-1.1) for corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is increased in CD. Infections, respiratory diseases, and digestive diseases are important specific causes of death. IBD medication use has varying associations with mortality. response to newly initiated diabetes therapies OBJECTIVE: The glycemic response to antihyperglycemic therapies for type 2 diabetes has been thoroughly evaluated in randomized controlled trials, but inadequately studied in real-world settings. STUDY DESIGN: We studied glycemic response among 15 126 type 2 diabetic patients who initiated any single new antihyperglycemic agent (metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, or insulin added to medical nutrition therapy or to existing diabetes therapies) during 1999-2000 within Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, an integrated healthcare delivery system. METHODS: Pre-post (3-12 months after initiation) change in glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) was analyzed using ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) models adjusted for baseline A1C, concurrent (ongoing) antihyperglycemic therapy, demographics, health behaviors, medication adherence, clinical factors, and processes of care. RESULTS: Mean A1C was 9.01% (95% confidence interval therapy initiation and 7.87% (95% CI 7.85%-7.90%) 3 to 12 months after initiation (mean A1C reduction 1.14 percentage points; 95% CI 1.11-1.17). Overall, achieved glycemic target (A1C < 7%). Although baseline disease severity and concurrent therapies differed greatly across therapeutic classes, after adjustment for these baseline clinical characteristics, no significant differences were noted in glucose-lowering effect across therapeutic classes. Treatment effects did not differ by age, race, diabetes duration, obesity, or level of renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin, sulfonylures, thiazolidinediones, and insulin were equally effective in improving glucose control. Nonetheless, most patients failed to achieve the glycemic target. Findings suggest that, to keep up with progressive worsening of glycemic control, patients and providers must commit to earlier, more aggressive therapy intensification, triggered promptly after A1C exceeds the recommended glycemic 2007 Nov;13(11):598-606. Cluster randomized trials: opportunities and barriers identified by leaders of eight health plans BACKGROUND: Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) offer unique advantages over standard randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and observational methodologies, and may provide a cost-efficient alternative for answering questions about the best treatments for common conditions. OBJECTIVES: To describe health plan leaders' views on CRTs, identify barriers to conducting CRTs, and solicit recommendations for increasing the acceptability of CRTs. RESEARCH DESIGN: Qualitative in-depth telephone interviews with leaders from 8 health plans. SUBJECTS: : Thirty-four health plan leaders (medical directors, pharmacy directors, Institutional Review Board leaders, ethics leaders, compliance leaders, and others). MEASURES: Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts to identify barriers, factors influencing leaders' views, ethical issues, aspects of CRTs that appeal to leaders, and recommendations for increasing acceptability of CRTs. RESULTS: Multiple barriers were identified, including financial costs, concerns about stakeholders' perceptions of CRTs, impact on physicians' prescribing habits, and formulary changes. Most leaders recognized the potential value of studying the comparative effectiveness of therapeutics, and many stressed the need for head-to-head trials. Leaders' views would be influenced by variations in study design and implementation. Recommendations for increasing acceptability of CRTs included ensuring that the fiscal impact of a CRT be budget neutral, and that researchers educate stakeholders and decision-makers about CRTs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, health plan leaders recognized the need for studies of the comparative effectiveness of therapeutics under real world conditions, and many expressed support for CRTs. However, researchers seeking to conduct CRTs in health plans are likely to face numerous barriers, and preparatory work will be essential. Authors: Oct;45(10 Supl 2):S29-37. The informed decisions toolbox: tools for knowledge transfer and performance improvement In recent years, spurred by developments in evidence-informed medicine, a movement to strengthen evidence-informed managerial decision making in healthcare organizations has emerged in the United States and in other countries. The drivers of this movement include demands by payers and consumer groups for improved quality of care, increased operational efficiency, and greater accountability from healthcare organizations. But numerous barriers to managers' use of evidence in decision making exist, including time pressures, perceived threats to autonomy, preference for colloquial knowledge based on individual experiences, difficulty accessing the relevant evidence base, reliance on external consultants (and others) to determine the quality of the information, and lack of resources. To help managers overcome these barriers, we developed the Informed Decisions Toolbox. It provides tools to help managers efficiently perform the six key steps in the evidence-informed approach to decision making: (1) framing the management question, (2) finding sources of information, (3) assessing the accuracy of the information, (4) assessing the applicability of the information, (5) assessing the actionability of the evidence, and (6) determining if the information is adequate. To build an organizational environment conducive to evidence-informed decision making, we suggest four leadership-driven strategies: (1) recognize and respond to the growing demand for accountability as a strategic issue, (2) establish organizational structures and processes for knowledge transfer, (3) build a questioning organizational culture, and (4) build organizational research capabilities. With organizational support, managers who use the tools presented in the Informed Decisions Toolbox will be able to take control of the decision-making process, will be less reliant on colloquial evidence and consultants, and will be better able to improve the performance of their organizations.

Complications at the end of life in ovarian cancer Women dying of ovarian cancer vary considerably in their complications and in the types of health care they receive. The objective of this study was to describe the complications of ovarian cancer, other than pain, and their treatment at the end of life. This study used a cohort of 421 enrollees in three nonprofit managed-care organizations who died with ovarian cancer during 1995-2000. Data were collected from abstraction of paper and electronic medical records. Proportions of women experiencing complications and undergoing treatments were calculated. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of patient characteristics with the probability of receiving an intervention for complications. The most common complications recorded in the medical record were fatigue or weakness (75%), nausea or vomiting (71%), constipation (49%), edema of the extremities (44%), and anemia (34%). The prevalence of major complications was follows: ascites, bowel disordered nutrition that required support with parenteral nutrition, 9%. Patients may not always have received interventions for major complications; for example, pleural effusion apparently was left untreated in almost half of the women with this problem. After adjustment, women who died at younger ages were more likely to receive an intervention, compared to older women (odds ratio for each decade of age, 0.71, 95% confidence interval=0.53, 0.94, P for trend=0.02). The study, which preceded the establishment of palliative care programs, suggests that care given to ovarian cancer patients at the end of life may be Pain Symptom Manage. 2007 Sep;34(3):237-43.

Incorporation of physiological trend and interaction effects in neonatal severity of illness scores: an experiment using a variant of the Richardson score OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether physiological trends and interaction terms could enhance predictive ability in a variant of the Richardson Score. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 2,222 newborns of 34 weeks or more gestation with respiratory distress. The outcome variable was assisted ventilation longer 3 days or death. Using logistic regression and split validation we fit models for a variant of the Richardson score (gestational age, worst PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio, lowest MAP, and a single interaction variable relating the lowest pH and the highest PaCO(2)) as well as models incorporating variables for trends and additional interaction terms. We assessed discrimination using the c-statistic. RESULTS: The 24-h Richardson score had a c-statistic of 0.83. In the validation dataset, adding pH trend significantly increased the c-statistic to 0.87. Adding PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio trend increased the c-statistic to 0.86. Interactions with high significance were present in the data (e.g., adding all two-way interactions to our best trend model yielded a c-statistic of 0.92) but were unstably estimated with n = 2,222. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating trend and interaction terms in severity scores can enhance predictive ability. These modeling strategies have been underutilized in severity scoring, but in an era of increasing electronic availability of detailed clinical data the incorporation of trend and interaction effects in severity scoring will become both feasible and desirable.

Agreement between self-reports and medical records was only fair in a cross-sectional study of performance of annual eye examinations among adults with diabetes in managed care BACKGROUND: Despite consensus about the importance of measuring quality of diabetes care and the widespread use of self-reports and medical records to assess quality, little is known about the degree of agreement between these data sources. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate agreement between self-reported and medical record data on annual eye examinations and to identify factors associated with agreement. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Data from interviews and medical records were available for 8409 adults with diabetes who participated in the baseline round of the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) Study. MEASURES: Agreement between self-reports and medical records was evaluated as concordance and Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: Self-reports indicated a higher performance of annual dilated eye examinations than did medical records (75.9% vs. 38.8%). Concordance between the data sources was 57.9%. Agreement was only fair (kappa coefficient = 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.26). Nearly two-thirds (64.6%) of discordance was due to lack of evidence in the medical record to support self-reported performance of the procedure. After adjustment, agreement was most strongly related to health plan (chi = 977.9, df = 9; P < 0.0001), and remained significantly better for 3 of the 10 health plans (P < 0.00001) and for persons younger than 45 years of age (P = 0.00002). CONCLUSIONS: The low level of agreement between self-report and medical records suggests that many providers of diabetes care do not have easily available accurate information on the eye examination status of their patients.

Quality of diabetes care among cancer survivors with diabetes BACKGROUND: Among patients with chronic medical conditions, unrelated conditions are often undertreated. OBJECTIVE: To compare the quality of diabetes care delivered to diabetic patients with and without cancer in a large regional integrated delivery system. DESIGN: Observational cohort study using propensity score methods to control for baseline differences between diabetic patients with and without a history of cancer. SUBJECTS: A total of 5773 Kaiser Northern California members with diabetes and previous cancer and 23,092 members with diabetes and no previous cancer. MEASURES: : Nine measures of diabetes technical quality and clinical outcomes in 2003. RESULTS: : Relative to diabetic patients without cancer, those with cancer had higher adjusted rates of HbA1c testing (66.3% vs. 64.4%; P = 0.02), HbA1c control (73.4% vs. 70.9%; P < 0.001), and urine microalbumin testing (59.1% vs. 55.2%; P < 0.001) but lower rates of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol control (40.7% vs. 42.2%; P = 0.02) and statin use if LDL >100 mg/dL (76.7% vs. 80.6%; P < 0.001). The groups had similar rates of LDL cholesterol testing, dilated retinal examinations, blood pressure control, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use for hypertension (all P >/= 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the potential for cancer-related services to compete with delivery of diabetes care, diabetic patients with cancer received care of generally similar quality relative to diabetic patients without cancer in this integrated delivery system. Nevertheless, the quality of diabetes care delivered to all patients could be improved, particularly the control of LDL cholesterol and blood pressure. Combining data from electronic disease registries has the potential for monitoring quality of care delivered to patients with more than 1 major medical illness. Authors: Minimum incidence of primary cervical dystonia in a multiethnic health care population BACKGROUND: The two existing estimates of the incidence of primary cervical dystonia were based on observations in relatively ethnically homogeneous populations of European descent. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the minimum incidence of primary cervical dystonia in the multiethnic membership of a health maintenance organization in Northern California. METHODS: Using a combination of electronic medical records followed by medical chart reviews, we identified incident cases of cervical dystonia first diagnosed between 1997 and 1999. RESULTS: We identified 66 incident cases of cervical dystonia from 8.2 million person-years of observation. The minimum estimate of the incidence of cervical dystonia in this population is 0.80 per 100,000 person-years. Ethnicity-specific incidence rates were calculated for individuals over age 30. Incidence was higher in white individuals (1.23 per 100,000 person-years) than in persons of other races (0.15 per 100,000 person-years, p < 0.0001). The minimum estimated incidence was 2.5 times higher in women than in men (1.14 vs 0.45 per 100,000 person-years, p = 0.0005). The average age at diagnosis was higher in women (56 years) than in men (45 years, p = 0.0004). There was no significant difference in reported symptom duration prior to diagnosis between women and men (3.9 vs 5.3 years). CONCLUSION: The estimated incidence of diagnosed cervical dystonia among white individuals in this Northern Californian population is similar to previous estimates in more ethnically homogeneous populations of largely European descent. The incidence in other races, including Hispanic, Asian, and black appears to be significantly lower. The incidence is also higher in women than in men. Authors: neurodevelopmental outcome of neonatal dehydration OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term outcome of neonatal dehydration. STUDY DESIGN: We identified 182 newborns who were rehospitalized with dehydration (weight loss > or =12% of birth weight and/or serum sodium > or =150 mEq/L) and 419 randomly selected controls from a cohort of 106,627 term and near-term infants with birth weight > or =2000 g born between 1995 and 1998 in northern California Kaiser Permanente hospitals. Outcomes data were obtained from electronic records, interviews, questionnaire responses, and neurodevelopmental evaluations performed in a masked fashion. RESULTS: Follow-up data to age at least 2 years were available for 173 of 182 children with a history of dehydration (95%) and 372 of 419 controls (89%) and included formal evaluation at a mean age (+/-standard deviation) of 5.1 +/- 0.12 years for 106 children (58%) and 168 children (40%), respectively. None of the cases developed shock, gangrene, or respiratory failure. Neither crude nor adjusted scores on cognitive tests differed significantly between groups. There was no significant difference between groups in the proportion of children with abnormal neurologic examinations or neurologic diagnoses. Frequencies of parental concerns and reported behavior problems also were not significantly different in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal dehydration in this managed care setting was not associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants born at or near gynecologic malignancies-new standards of care Studies on cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian and primary peritoneal cancer have consistently shown a strong correlation between cytoreduction and survival, with the best survival observed in patients who have no visible residual disease after successful cytoreductive surgery. Recent data that intraperitoneal chemotherapy further improves survival after optimal cytoreduction adds to the potential benefit of such surgery. More recently, significant survival benefit from optimal cytoreduction has also been shown for patients with recurrent disease and for women with advanced endometrial carcinoma. The selection criteria for patients and critical aspects of the operative technique and timing of cytoreductive surgery are discussed. Authors: Suh-Burgmann E; Clin N Am. Jul;16(3):667-82, x-xi. What women wish they knew before prophylactic mastectomy Although prophylactic mastectomy significantly reduces the incidence and recurrence of breast cancer, little is known about women's information needs before the procedure. We surveyed 967 women, from 6 healthcare systems, with bilateral or contralateral prophylactic mastectomy performed between 1979 and 1999. There were 2 open-ended questions: 'What one thing do you wish you had known before your prophylactic mastectomy' and 'Is there anything else you would like to share with us?' Three researchers categorized responses, and informational needs were ascertained. Seventy-one percent (684 women) responded, of which 81% answered one or both open-ended questions. There were 386 comments (made by 293 women) that related to information needs; 79% of women had bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and 58% had contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Most concerns (69%) were related to reconstruction: the longevity; look and feel of implants, pain, numbness, scarring, and reconstruction options. Many women wished they had seen photographs to better prepare them for the final result. Our findings suggest that information needs of many women undergoing prophylactic mastectomy, particularly those selecting bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, have not been sufficiently addressed. Clinicians and health educators should be aware of patient needs and must counsel women Cancer Nurs. 2007 Jul-Aug;30(4):285-91; quiz 292-3. Risk factors for mortality among patients with diabetes: the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) Study OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine demographic, socioeconomic, and biological predictors of all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Survey, medical record, and administrative data were obtained from 8,733 participants in the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes Study, a multicenter, prospective, observational study of diabetes care in managed care. Data on deaths (n = 791) and cause of death were obtained from the National Death Index after 4 years. Predictors examined included age, sex, race, education, income, duration, and treatment of diabetes, BMI, smoking, microvascular and macrovascular complications, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Predictors of adjusted all-cause mortality included older age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04 [95% CI 1.03-1.05]), male sex (1.57 [1.35-1.83]), lower income (< $15,000 vs. > $75,000, HR 1.82 [1.30-2.54]; $15,000-$40,000 vs. > $75,000, HR 1.58 [1.15-2.17]), longer duration of diabetes (> or = 9 years vs. < 9 years, HR 1.20 [1.02-1.41]), lower BMI (< 26 vs. 26-30 kg/m2, HR 1.43 [1.13-1.69]), smoking (1.44 [1.20-1.74]), nephropathy (1.46 [1.23-2.73]), macrovascular disease (1.46 [1.23-1.74]), and greater Charlson index (> or = 2-3 vs. < 1, HR 2.01 [1.04-3.90]; > or = 3 vs. < 1, HR 4.38 [2.26-8.47]). The predictors of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality were different. Macrovascular disease predicted cardiovascular but not noncardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Among people with diabetes and access to medical care, older age, male sex, smoking, and renal disease are important predictors of mortality. Even within an insured population, socioeconomic circumstance is an important independent predictor of health. Authors: Diabetes 2007 Jul;30(7):1736-41. Epub 2007 Apr 27. Effect of cost-sharing changes on self-monitoring of blood glucose OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of cost-sharing policy changes on utilization of test strips for self-monitoring of blood glucose. STUDY DESIGN: A legislative mandate (January 1, 2000) required California health plans to cover diabetes supplies, including those for self-monitoring of blood glucose. One health plan, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, initially waived established copayments and provided free test strips to members with diabetes mellitus for 2 years but later instituted a 20% coinsurance charge for a portion of their membership. METHODS: A retrospective cohort design was used to study pharmacy-based estimates of test strip utilization changes during this natural experiment. Analyses included 2 cohort investigations using pretest-posttest analysis with control subjects to study transitions from a copayment period to a free test strip period and from the free test strip period to a coinsurance period. RESULTS: During the copayment period, test strip utilization was inversely related to copayments for test strips. Offering free test strips did not increase utilization, even among those paying higher copayments before the policy change. Price-elastic patterns formed before and during the copayment period persisted, despite receiving free test strips for 2 years. The coinsurance, introduced after 2 years of receiving free test strips, resulted in statistically significant (but not clinically relevant) decreased utilization (approximately 1-3 fewer test strips/month). Change patterns did not differ by socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Offering free test strips shifted costs from patient to health plan, without improving adherence. The introduced coinsurance slightly reduced utilization and adherence to recommendations about self-monitoring of blood glucose. Neither intervention had marked clinical effect. Cross-sectional analyses should not be used to predict utilization changes in the face of rapidly evolving benefit policies. Authors: Karter AJ; Manag Care. 2007 Jul;13(7):408-16. Clustering of inflammatory bowel disease with immune mediated diseases among members of a northern california-managed care organization BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies provide evidence that some immune-mediated diseases occur at greater frequency among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients than in the general population. The present study examined the co-occurrence of IBD with common immune-mediated disorders including asthma, psoriasis, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus and Hashimoto's), and chronic glomerulonephritis. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program for the period 1996-2005. A total of 12,601 patients with at least two IBD diagnoses in computerized visit data were ascertained. Four persons without IBD were matched to each IBD patient on age, gender, and length of enrollment. Information on co-occurring diseases was obtained from computerized visit data for 1996-2005. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for the association of IBD with immune-mediated disorders after adjusting for smoking. RESULTS: Seventeen percent of the IBD patients and 10% of the persons without IBD had a diagnosis for at least one immune-mediated disease. IBD patients were more likely to have asthma (1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.6), psoriasis (1.7, 95% CI 1.5-2.0), rheumatoid and sclerosis (2.3, 95% CI 1.6-3.3). CONCLUSIONS: Among the immune-mediated diseases we studied, most were more common in IBD patients than in persons without IBD, suggesting that IBD shares common etiologic factors with Epub 2007 Apr 16. Social support among women who died of ovarian cancer GOALS OF WORK: We investigated the effects of social support in the last 6 months of life for women who died of ovarian cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included women enrolled in one of three Managed Care Organizations who died of ovarian cancer (1995-2000). Information was collected on demographics, living environment, presence of escorts to oncology encounters, comorbidities, medications, outpatient and inpatient encounters, and referrals to home health and hospice. Two characteristics of social support were examined: living with others and being escorted to one or more oncology visits. RESULTS: Of 421 subjects, both aspects of social support were known for 345 (82%). Of these, 227 (66%) lived with others and were escorted, 33 (10%) lived with others but were never escorted, 59 (17%) lived alone but were escorted, and 26 (8%) lived alone and never were accompanied. Women living alone were less likely to be taking a psychotropic medication (57% vs 70%, p = 0.021) and were somewhat less likely to receive hospice referral (42% vs 53%, p = 0.054). Women who were never escorted had fewer outpatient encounters (12.60 vs 15.77, p = 0.033) and were less likely to be referred to home health (18% vs 30%, p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that social support has some beneficial effects on receipt of personal health services. Friends and family may act as proponents for the patient in obtaining services. Health care professionals should be encouraged to assess the cancer patient's social situation and identify areas where help may be 2007 May;15(5):547-56. Epub 2006 Dec 20. Estimation of the period prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease among nine health plans using computerized diagnoses and outpatient pharmacy dispensings BACKGROUND: There are few contemporary estimates of prevalence rates for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in diverse North American communities. METHODS: We estimated the period prevalence of IBD for January 1, 1999, through June 30, 2001, among 1.8 million randomly sampled members of nine integrated healthcare organizations in the US using computerized diagnoses and outpatient pharmaceutical dispensing. We also assessed the positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivities of 1) the case-finding algorithm, and 2) the 30-month sampling period using medical chart review and linkage to a 78-month dataset, respectively. RESULTS: The PPV (95% CI, 79-89) in two different organizations. In both, the sensitivity of the optimal algorithm, compared with the most inclusive, exceeded 90%. The sensitivity of the 30-month sampling period compared with 78 months was 61% (95% CI, 57-64) in one organization. Applying a slightly more sensitive case-finding algorithm, the average period prevalence of IBD across the nine organizations, standardized to the age- and gender-distribution of the US population, 2000 census, was 388 cases (95% CI, 378-397) per 100,000 persons (range 209-784 per 100,000; average follow-up 26 months). The prevalence of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and unspecified IBD was 129, 191, and 69 per 100,000, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The observed average prevalence was similar to prevalence proportions reported for other North American populations (369-408 per 100,000). Additional research is needed to understand differences in the occurrence of IBD among diverse populations as well as practice variation in diagnosis and treatment of Bowel Dis. 2007 Apr;13(4):451-61. Predicted quality-adjusted life years as a composite measure of the clinical value of diabetes risk factor control BACKGROUND: Control of blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and A1c can lower the risk for diabetes complications. These quality indicators often are examined separately and weighted equally in performance measurement, potentially discarding important information. OBJECTIVES: We sought to create a composite indicator of the clinical benefit, or value, of diabetes risk factor control that appropriately weights the clinical importance of A1c, LDL-c, and blood pressure, and to test its usability for quality measurement. METHODS: The combined value of control for 3 diabetes risk factors, measured by predicted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), was compared in diabetes patients (n = 129,236 in 2001; n = 185,006 in 2003) in Kaiser Permanente Northern California across 16 medical center populations in 2001 and 2003 using hierarchical linear regression to adjust for case-mix differences. Patient-level QALYs, simulated from risk factor and case-mix variables in a Markov model, was the main outcome variable. RESULTS: There was significant cross-sectional variability in average case-mix adjusted QALYs for diabetes patients across centers in 2003. QALYs increased from 2001 to 2003 as the result of improved risk factor control; longitudinal improvements in QALYs also showed variation across centers. Regression analyses demonstrated the greater impact of blood pressure versus LDL-c or A1c control on QALYs, and the greater value of risk factor control in those with poor versus near or in-control blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Using predicted QALYs to measure value holds promise as a sensitive composite indicator for quality measurement. Complex, evidence-based quality indicators such as these can potentially provide accurate and useful information to health plans, providers, and consumers. 2007 Specificity of clinical breast examination in community practice BACKGROUND: Millions of women receive clinical breast examination (CBE) each year, as either a breast cancer screening test or a diagnostic test for breast symptoms. While screening CBE had moderately high specificity (approximately 94%) in clinical trials, community clinicians may be comparatively inexperienced and may conduct relatively brief examinations, resulting in even higher specificity but lower sensitivity. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the specificity of screening and diagnostic CBE in clinical practice and identify patient factors associated with specificity. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SUBJECTS: Breast-cancer-free female health plan enrollees in 5 states (WA, OR, CA, MA, and MN) who received CBE (N = 1,484). MEASUREMENTS: Medical charts were abstracted to ascertain breast cancer risk factors, examination purpose (screening vs diagnostic), and results (true-negative vs false-positive). Women were considered 'average-risk' if they had neither a family history of breast cancer nor a prior breast biopsy and 'increased-risk' otherwise. RESULTS: Among average- and increased-risk women, respectively, the specificity (true-negative proportion) of screening CBE a true-negative screening CBE (specificity) were significantly lower among women at increased risk of breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio 0.21; 95% CI: 0.10-0.46). CONCLUSIONS: Screening CBE likely has higher specificity among community clinicians compared to examiners in clinical trials of breast cancer screening, even among women at increased breast cancer risk. Highly specific examinations, however, may have relatively low sensitivity for breast cancer. Diagnostic CBE, meanwhile, is relatively nonspecific.

Quality of life after bilateral prophylactic mastectomy BACKGROUND: Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy in women with increased breast cancer risk dramatically reduces breast cancer occurrence but little is known about psychosocial outcomes. METHODS: To examine long-term quality of life after bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, we mailed surveys to 195 women who had the procedure from 1979 to 1999 and to a random sample of 117 women at increased breast cancer risk who did not have the procedure. Measures were modeled on or drawn directly from validated instruments designed to assess quality of life, body image, sexuality, breast cancer concerns, depression, health perception, and demographic characteristics. We used logistic regression to examine associations between quality of life and other domains. RESULTS: The response rate was 58%, with 106 women with and 62 women without prophylactic mastectomy returning complete surveys. Among women who underwent bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, 84% were satisfied with their decision to have the procedure; 61% reported high contentment with quality of life compared with an identical 61% of women who did not have the procedure (P = 1.0). Among all subjects, diminished contentment with quality of life was not associated with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy but with dissatisfaction with sex life (adjusted ratio [OR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-6.2), possible depression (CES-D > 16, OR = 4.9, CI = 2.0-11.8), and poor or fair general health perception (OR = 8.3, 95% CI = 2.4-29.0). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of women reported satisfaction with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and experienced psychosocial outcomes similar to women with similarly elevated breast cancer risk who did not undergo prophylactic mastectomy. Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy appears to neither positively nor negatively impact long-term psychosocial outcomes. Authors: Geiger AM; Rolnick Oncol. 2007 Feb;14(2):686-94. Epub 2006 Nov 11. Racial differences in tumor stage and survival for colorectal cancer in an insured population BACKGROUND: Despite declining death rates from colorectal cancer (CRC), racial disparities have continued to increase. In this study, the authors examined disparities in a racially diverse group of insured patients. METHODS: This study was conducted among patients who were diagnosed with CRC from 1993 to 1998, when they were enrolled in integrated healthcare systems. Patients were identified from tumor registries and were linked to information in administrative databases. The sample was restricted to non-Hispanic whites (n = 10,585), non-Hispanic blacks (n = 1479), Hispanics (n = 985), and Asians/Pacific Islanders (n = 909). Differences in tumor stage and survival were analyzed by using polytomous and Cox regression models, respectively. RESULTS: In multivariable regression analyses, blacks were more likely than whites to have distant or unstaged tumors. In Cox models that were adjusted for nonmutable factors, blacks had a higher risk of death from CRC (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.06-1.30). Hispanics had a risk of death similar to whites (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.92-1.18), whereas Asians/Pacific Islanders had a lower risk of death from CRC (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78-1.02). Adjustment for tumor stage decreased the HR to 1.11 for blacks, and the addition of receipt of surgical therapy to the model decreased the HR further to 1.06. The HR among Hispanics and Asians/Pacific Islanders was stable to adjustment for tumor stage and surgical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The relation between race and survival from CRC was complex and appeared to be related to differences in tumor stage and therapy received, even in insured populations. Targeted interventions to improve the use of effective screening and treatment among vulnerable populations may be needed to eliminate disparities in CRC.

Maternal and obstetric complications of pregnancy are associated with increasing gestational age at term OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate when rates of maternal pregnancy complications increase beyond 37 weeks of gestation. STUDY DESIGN: We designed a retrospective cohort study of all low-risk women delivered beyond 37 weeks' gestational age from 1995 to 1999 within a mature managed care organization. Rates of mode of delivery and maternal complications of labor and delivery were examined by gestational age with both bivariate and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: We found that, among the 119,254 women who delivered at 37 completed weeks and beyond, the rates of operative vaginal delivery (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.09, 1.22), 3rd- or 4th-degree perineal laceration (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24), and chorioamnionitis (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.21, 1.44) all increased at 40 weeks as compared to 39 weeks of gestation (P .001), and rates of postpartum hemorrhage (OR 1.21, 95% CI (1.10, 1.32), endomyometritis (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.14, 1.87), and primary cesarean delivery (1.28, 95% CI 1.20, 1.36) increased at 41 weeks of gestation (P .001). The cesarean indications of nonreassuring fetal heart rate (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.49, 2.19) and cephalo-pelvic disproportion (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.40, 1.94) increased at 40 weeks of gestation (P .001). CONCLUSION: We found that the risk of maternal peripartum complications increase as pregnancy progresses beyond 40 weeks of gestation. Management of pregnancies that progress past their EDC should include counseling regarding the risks of increasing gestational age. Authors: Caughey AB; 2007 Feb;196(2):155.e1-6. Neonatal intensive care unit census influences discharge of moderately preterm infants OBJECTIVE: The timely discharge of moderately premature infants has important economic implications. The decision to discharge should occur independent of unit census. We evaluated the impact of unit census on the decision to discharge moderately preterm infants. DESIGN/METHODS: In a prospective multicenter cohort study, we enrolled 850 infants born between 30 and 34 weeks' gestation at 10 NICUs in Massachusetts and California. We divided the daily census from each hospital into quintiles and tested whether discharges were evenly distributed among them. Using logistic regression, we analyzed predictors of discharge within census quintiles associated with a greater- or less-than-expected likelihood of discharge. We then explored parental satisfaction and postdischarge resource consumption in relation to discharge during census periods that were associated with high proportions of discharge. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between unit census and likelihood of discharge. When unit census was in the lowest quintile, patients were 20% less likely to be discharged when compared with all of the other quintiles of unit census. In the lowest quintile of unit census, patient/nurse ratio was the only variable associated with discharge. When census was in the highest quintile, patients were 32% more likely to be discharged when compared with all of the other quintiles of unit census. For patients in this quintile, a higher patient/nurse ratio increased the likelihood of discharge. Conversely, infants with prolonged lengths of stay, an increasing Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology II, and minor congenital anomalies were less likely to be discharged. Infants discharged at high unit census did not differ from their peers in terms of parental satisfaction, emergency department visits, home nurse visits, or rehospitalization rates. CONCLUSIONS: Discharges are closely correlated with unit census. Providers incorporate demand and case mix into their discharge decisions.

Pain management in the last six months of life among women who died of ovarian cancer Previous studies indicate that the symptoms of many dying cancer patients are undertreated and many suffer unnecessary pain. We obtained data retrospectively from three large health maintenance organizations, and examined the analgesic drug therapies received in the last six months of life by women who died of ovarian cancer between 1995 and 2000. Subjects were identified through cancer registries and administrative data. Outpatient medications used during the final six months of life were obtained from pharmacy databases. Pain information was obtained from medical charts. We categorized each medication based on the World Health Organization classification for pain management (mild, moderate, or intense). Of the 421 women, only 64 (15%) had no mention of pain in their charts. The use of medications typically prescribed for moderate to severe pain ('high intensity' drugs) increased as women approached death. At 5-6 months before death, 55% of women were either on no pain medication or medication generally used for mild pain; only 9% were using the highest intensity regimen. The percentage on the highest intensity regimen (drugs generally used for severe pain) increased to 22% at 3-4 months before death and 54% at 1-2 months. Older women (70 or older) were less likely to be prescribed the highest intensity medication than those under age 70 (44% vs. 70%, P<0.001). No differences were found in the use of the high intensity drugs by race, marital status, year of diagnosis, stage of disease, or comorbidity. Our finding that only 54% of women with pain were given high intensity medication near death indicates room for improvement in the care of ovarian cancer patients at the end of life.

We examined the patient activation measure's (PAM's) association with process and health outcomes among adults with chronic conditions. Patients with high PAM scores were significantly more likely to perform self-management behaviors, use self-management services, and report high medication adherence, compared to patients with the lowest PAM scores. This population was 10 times more likely to report high patient-satisfaction scores, 5 times more likely to report high quality-of-life scores, and reported significantly higher physical and mental functional status scores, compared to those with the lowest scores.

Understanding panel management: a comparative study of an emerging approach to population care Context: Panel management is an innovative approach for population care that is tightly linked with primary care. This approach, which is spreading rapidly across Kaiser Permanente, represents an important shift in population-care structure and emphasis, but its potential and implications have not been previously studied.Objective: To inform the ongoing spread of panel management by providing an early understanding of its impact on patients, physicians, and staff and to identify barriers and facilitators.Design: Qualitative studies at four sites, including patient focus groups, physician and staff interviews, and direct observation.Findings: Panel management allows primary care physicians to use dedicated time to direct proactive care for their patients, uses staff support to conduct outreach, and leverages new panel-based information technology tools. Patients reported appreciating the panel management outreach, although some also reported coordination issues. Two of four study sites seemed to provide a more coordinated patient experience of care; factors common to these sites included longer maturation of their panel management programs and a more circumscribed role for outreach staff. Some physicians reported tension in the approach's implementation: All believed that panel management improved care for their patients but many also expressed feeling that the approach added more tasks to their already busy days. Challenges yet to be fully addressed include providing program oversight to monitor for safe and reliable coordination of care and incorporation of self-management support.Conclusion: Subsequent spread of panel management should be informed by these lessons and findings from early adopters and should include continued monitoring of the impact of this rapidly developing approach on quality, patient satisfaction, primary care sustainability, and cost.

Educational disparities in health behaviors among patients with diabetes: the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) Study BACKGROUND: Our understanding of social disparities in diabetes-related health behaviors is incomplete. The purpose of this study was to determine if having less education is associated with poorer diabetes-related health behaviors. METHODS: This observational study was based on a cohort of 8,763 survey respondents drawn from ~180,000 patients with diabetes receiving care from 68 provider groups in ten managed care health plans across the United States. Self-reported survey data included individual educational attainment ('education') and five diabetes self-care behaviors among individuals for whom the behavior would clearly be indicated: foot exams (among those with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or a history of foot ulcers); self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG; among insulin users only); smoking; exercise; and certain diabetes-related health seeking behaviors (use of diabetes health education, website, or support group in last 12 months). Predicted probabilities were modeled at each level of self-reported educational attainment using hierarchical logistic regression models with random effects for clustering within health plans. RESULTS: Patients with less education had significantly lower predicted probabilities of being a non-smoker and engaging in regular exercise and health-seeking behaviors, while SMBG and foot self-examination did not vary by education. Extensive adjustment for patient factors revealed no discernable confounding effect on the estimates or their significance, and most education-behavior relationships were similar across sex, race and other patient characteristics. The relationship between education and smoking varied significantly across age, with a strong inverse relationship in those aged 25-44, modest for those ages 45-64, but non-evident for those over 65. Intensity of disease management by the health plan and provider communication did not alter the examined education-behavior relationships. Other measures of socioeconomic position yielded similar findings. CONCLUSION: The relationship between educational attainment and health behaviors was modest in strength for most behaviors. Over the life course, the cumulative effect of reduced practice of multiple self-care behaviors among less educated patients may play an important part in shaping the social health gradient.

The association between clinical care strategies and the attenuation of racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes care: the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) Study OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether greater implementation of clinical care strategies in managed care is associated with attenuation of known racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using cross-sectional data, we examined the quality of diabetes care as measured by frequencies of process delivery as well as medication management of intermediate outcomes, for 7426 black, Latinos, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and white participants enrolled in 10 managed care plans within 63 provider groups. We stratified models by intensity of 3 clinical care strategies at the provider group level: physician reminders, physician feedback, or use of a diabetes registry. RESULTS: Exposure to clinical care strategy implementation at the provider group level varied by race and ethnicity, with <10% of black participants enrolled in provider groups in the highest-intensity quintile for physician feedback and <10% of both black and Asian/Pacific Islander participants enrolled in groups in the highest-intensity quintile for diabetes registry use. Although disparities in care were confirmed, particularly for black relative to white subjects, we did not find a consistent pattern of disparity attenuation with increasing implementation intensity for either processes of care or medication management of intermediate outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: For the most part, high-intensity implementation of a diabetes registry, physician feedback, or physician reminders, 3 clinical care strategies similar to those used in many health care settings, are not associated with attenuation of known disparities of diabetes care in managed care.

Recent declines in hormone therapy utilization and breast cancer incidence: clinical and population-based of evidence-based quality improvement on depression in primary care: a randomized experiment CONTEXT: Previous studies testing continuous quality improvement (CQI) for depression showed no effects. Methods for practices to self-improve depression care performance are needed. We assessed the impacts of evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI), a modification of CQI, as carried out by 2 different health care systems, and collected qualitative data on the design and implementation process. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate impacts of EBQI on practice-wide depression care and outcomes. DESIGN: Practice-level randomized experiment comparing EBQI with usual care. SETTING: Six Kaiser Permanente of Northern California and 3 Veterans Administration primary care practices randomly assigned to EBQI teams (6 practices) or usual care (3 practices). Practices included 245 primary care clinicians and 250,000 patients. INTERVENTION: Researchers assisted system senior leaders to identify priorities for EBQI teams; initiated the manual-based EBQI process; and provided references and tools. EVALUATION PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred and sixty-seven representative patients with major depression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Appropriate treatment, depression, functional status, and satisfaction. RESULTS: Depressed patients in EBQI practices showed a trend toward more appropriate treatment compared with those in usual care (46.0% vs 39.9% at 6 months, P = .07), but no significant improvement in 12-month depression symptom outcomes (27.0% vs 36.1% poor depression outcome, P = .18). Social functioning improved significantly (mean score 65.0 vs 56.8 at 12 months, P = .02); physical functioning did not. CONCLUSION: Evidence-based quality improvement had perceptible, but modest, effects on practice performance for patients with depression. The modest improvements, along with qualitative data, identify potential future directions for improving CQI research and practice.

Disparities in HbA1c levels between African-American and non-Hispanic white adults with diabetes: a meta-analysis OBJECTIVE: Among individuals with diabetes, a comparison of HbA(1c) (A1C) levels between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites was evaluated. Data sources included PubMed, Web of Science, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, the Cochrane Library, the Combined Health Information Database, and the Education Resources Information Center. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We executed a search for articles published between 1993 and 2005. Data on sample size, age, sex, A1C, geographical location, and study design were extracted. Cross-sectional data and baseline data from clinical trials and cohort studies for African Americans and non-Hispanic whites with diabetes were included. Diabetic subjects aged <18 years and those with pre-diabetes or gestational diabetes were excluded. We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the difference in the mean values of A1C for African Americans and non-Hispanic whites. RESULTS: A total of 391 studies were reviewed, of which 78 contained A1C data. Eleven had data on A1C for African Americans and non-Hispanic whites and met selection criteria. A meta-analysis revealed the standard effect to be 0.31 (95% CI 0.39-0.25). This standard effect correlates to an A1C difference between groups of approximately 0.65%, indicating a higher A1C across studies for African Americans. Grouping studies by study type (cross-sectional or cohort), method of data collection for A1C (chart review or blood draw), and insurance status (managed care or nonmanaged care) showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The higher A1C observed in this meta-analysis among African Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites may contribute to disparity in diabetes morbidity and mortality in this population.

Variations in hospice use among cancer patients BACKGROUND: Previous studies have documented that hospice enrollment by terminally ill cancer patients varies substantially by patient characteristics and across broad geographic regions, but little is known about how local practice patterns and individual physicians contribute to these variations. We examined hospice use within a regional integrated health care delivery system that provides consistent insurance coverage and hospice availability for its members to evaluate the relative importance of patient characteristics, physician characteristics, individual physicians, and local health centers in explaining variations in hospice enrollment. METHODS: We examined data for 3805 Kaiser Permanente of Northern California health plan enrollees who were diagnosed with and died of lung, colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer from January 1, 1996, through June 30, 2001. We used a random-effects linear probability hierarchical model to estimate adjusted hospice enrollment rates and identify factors associated with hospice enrollment. All P values are two-sided. RESULTS: Overall, 65.4% of patients enrolled in hospice care before death. In adjusted analyses, hospice enrollment did not vary by patients' race/ethnicity or marital status (all P>.2) but varied substantially among the 11 health centers where patients were treated (standard deviation [SD] of random effect = 10.0 percentage points, corresponding to an estimated adjusted hospice enrollment rate for two-thirds of centers (2 SDs) ranging from 55% to 75%, P = .02). Hospice enrollment varied less among the 675 individual physicians (SD = 4.6 percentage points; P = .09). CONCLUSIONS: Health care within a large integrated delivery system has the potential to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in hospice use, but substantial variation in hospice use persists among local health centers. Focused efforts to understand how patients, physicians, and hospices interact at the local level are important to ensure equal access to hospice care for all terminally ill cancer patients. 2006 Aug 2;98(15):1053-9. Who is tested for diabetic kidney disease and who initiates treatment? The Translating Research Into Action For Diabetes (TRIAD) Study OBJECTIVE: We examined factors associated with screening for albuminuria and initiation of ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) treatment in diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted surveys and medical record reviews for 5,378 patients participating in a study of diabetes care in managed care at baseline (2000-2001) and follow-up (2002-2003). Factors associated with testing for albuminuria were examined in cross-sectional analysis at baseline. Factors associated with initiating ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy were determined prospectively. RESULTS: At baseline, 52% of patients not receiving ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy and without known diabetic kidney disease (DKD) were screened for albuminuria. Patients > or =65 years of age, those with higher HbA(1c), those with cardiovascular disease (CVD), and those without hyperlipidemia were less likely to be screened. Of the patients with positive screening tests, 47% began ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy. Initiation of therapy was associated with positive screening test results, BMI > or =25 kg/m(2), treatment with insulin or oral antidiabetic agents, peripheral neuropathy, systolic blood pressure > or =140 mmHg, and CVD. Of the patients receiving ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy or with known DKD, 63% were tested for albuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for albuminuria was inadequate, especially in older patients or those with competing medical concerns. The value of screening could be increased if more patients with positive screening tests initiated ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy. The efficiency of screening could be improved by limiting screening to diabetic patients not receiving ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy and without known al. Diabetes Care. 2006 Aug;29(8):1733-8.

Longitudinal study of new and prevalent use of self-monitoring of blood glucose OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess longitudinal association between self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and glycemic control in diabetic patients from an integrated health plan (Kaiser Permanente Northern California). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Longitudinal analyses of glycemic control among 1) 16,091 patients initiating SMBG (new-user cohort) and 2) 15,347 ongoing users of SMBG (prevalent-user cohort). SMBG frequency was based on pharmacy use (number of blood glucose test strips dispensed), and glycemic control was based on HbA(1c) (A1C). In the new-user cohort, ANCOVA models (pre- and posttest design) were used to assess the effect of initiating SMBG. In the prevalent-user cohort, repeated-measure, mixed-effects models with random-intercept and time-dependent covariates were used to assess changes in SMBG and A1C. All models were stratified by therapy (no medications, oral agents only, or insulin) and adjusted for baseline A1C, sociodemographics, insulin injection frequency, comorbidity index, medication adherence, smoking status, health care use, and provider specialty. RESULTS: Greater SMBG practice frequency among new users was associated with a graded decrease in A1C (relative to nonusers) regardless of diabetes therapy (P < 0.0001). Changes in SMBG frequency among prevalent users were associated with an inverse graded change in A1C only among pharmacologically treated patients (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These observational findings are consistent with short-term benefits of initiating SMBG practice for all patients but continuing benefits only for pharmacologically treated patients. Differences in effectiveness between new versus prevalent users of SMBG have implications for guideline development and interpretation of observational outcomes data.

Alcohol consumption is inversely associated with adherence to diabetes self-care behaviours AIMS: Our aim was to examine the associations of alcohol consumption with six diabetes self-care behaviours. METHODS: We determined levels of alcohol consumption and examined associations between alcohol consumption and six self-care behaviours in 65 996 adults with diabetes who received care through Kaiser Permanente Northern California and who responded to a 1994-1997 survey. Adherence with recommendations for self monitoring of blood glucose, HbA1c testing, and diabetes medications were determined from electronic records; smoking and use of diet and exercise to treat diabetes were self reported. Multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the associations between alcohol consumption (average number of drinks/day in the past year) and the probability of adherence to each self-care behaviour. RESULTS: Current alcohol consumption was reported by 50.8% of adults with diabetes. In adjusted models, we observed a gradient of increasing risk for poor adherence to diabetes self-care behaviours with increasing alcohol consumption, starting with those who consume even one drink a day. Former drinkers had the greatest compliance with each self-care behaviour, except for current smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption is a marker for poorer adherence to diabetes self-care behaviours. These findings highlight the importance of routine assessment of alcohol intake in people with diabetes, particularly as half of adults with diabetes consume alcohol. Given extant evidence that moderate alcohol intake may have cardiovascular benefits for patients with diabetes, examination of the trade-offs between cardiovascular benefits vs. potential risk of lower adherence with self-care behaviours deserves study.

Unstudied infants: outcomes of moderately premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit BACKGROUND: Newborns of 30-34 weeks gestation comprise 3.9% of all live births in the United States and 32% of all premature infants. They have been studied much less than very low birthweight infants. OBJECTIVE: To measure in-hospital outcomes and readmission within three months of discharge of moderately premature infants. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study including retrospective chart review and telephone interviews after discharge. SETTING: Ten birth hospitals in California and Massachusetts. PATIENTS: Surviving moderately premature infants born between October 2001 and February 2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (a) Occurrence of assisted ventilation during the hospital stay after birth; (b) adverse in-hospital outcomes-for example, necrotising enterocolitis; (c) readmission within three months of discharge. RESULTS: With the use of prospective cluster sampling, 850 eligible infants and their families were identified, randomly selected, and enrolled. A total of 677 families completed a telephone interview three months after hospital discharge. During the birth stay, these babies experienced substantial morbidity: 45.7% experienced assisted ventilation, and 3.2% still required supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks. Readmission within three months occurred in 11.2% of the cohort and was higher among male infants and those with chronic lung disease. CONCLUSIONS: Moderately premature infants experience significant morbidity, as evidenced by high rates of assisted ventilation, use of oxygen at 36 weeks, and readmission. Such morbidity deserves more research. Authors: Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed. 2006 Jul;91(4):F238-44. Epub 2006 Apr 12. Long-term outcomes following conservative surgery for borderline tumor of the ovary: a large population-based study OBJECTIVES: To examine outcomes in women treated with conservative surgery for borderline ovarian tumor in a large population-based cohort with long-term follow-up. METHODS: Women treated by conservative surgery for borderline tumor of the ovary from 1982-2004 within a large HMO setting were identified using electronic and tumor registry data. Chart review was performed when electronic data were incomplete. The indications for and outcomes from any subsequent gynecologic surgery and the risk of recurrent ovarian borderline and malignant tumor were determined. Risk factors for recurrence were analyzed using multivariate regression. RESULTS: Among one hundred and ninety-three patients identified, the average age was 33 (12-95), with 97% having apparent Stage I disease. Patients were followed with remaining ovarian tissue in situ for a mean of 6.9 years, with 59 women having 10 or more years of such observation. There were 21 recurrences with borderline tumor (11%) with a median time to first recurrence of 4.7 years; women treated by cystectomy recurred three times more often compared to women treated by oophorectomy (23% versus 7%). Two patients (1%) recurred with malignant disease involving remaining ovarian tissue, both within the first 3 years after surgery, with one death due to recurrence. During long-term follow-up, 19% of patients eventually underwent complete removal of ovarian tissue: in 8%, the surgery was prophylactic, in 5%, surgery was done for benign pathology, and in 6% for recurrent disease. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based HMO setting, 11% of women treated with conservative surgery for borderline tumor recurred; however, half of these recurrences were successfully managed by repeat conservative surgery, with only 6% of women overall needing eventual complete removal of ovaries for recurrent disease. Patients treated by cystectomy were three times more likely to recur than those treated by oophorectomy. Malignant recurrences were rare, and while borderline recurrences often occurred more than 3 years after initial surgery, late malignant recurrences were not observed. These favorable long-term outcomes provide support for conservative surgery for these women. Authors: Suh-Burgmann E Gynecol Oncol. 2006 Dec;103(3):841-7. Epub 2006 Jun 21. Outcomes among newborns with total serum bilirubin levels of 25 mg per deciliter or more BACKGROUND: The neurodevelopmental risks associated with high total serum bilirubin levels in newborns are not well defined. METHODS: We identified 140 infants with neonatal total serum bilirubin levels of at least 25 mg per deciliter (428 micromol per liter) and 419 randomly selected controls from a cohort of 106,627 term and near-term infants born from 1995 through 1998 in Kaiser Permanente hospitals in northern California. Data on outcomes were obtained from electronic records, interviews, responses to questionnaires, and neurodevelopmental evaluations that had been performed in a blinded fashion. RESULTS: Peak bilirubin levels were between 25 and 29.9 mg per deciliter (511 micromol per liter) in 130 of the newborns with hyperbilirubinemia and 30 mg per deciliter (513 micromol per liter) or more in 10 newborns; treatment involved phototherapy in 136 cases and exchange transfusion in 5. Follow-up data to the age of at least two years were available for 132 of 140 children with a history of hyperbilirubinemia (94 percent) and 372 of 419 controls (89 percent) and included formal evaluation at a mean (+/-SD) age of 5.1+/-0.12 years for 82 children (59 percent) and 168 children (40 percent), respectively. There were no cases of kernicterus. Neither crude nor adjusted scores on cognitive tests differed significantly between the two groups; on most tests, 95 percent confidence intervals excluded a 3-point (0.2 SD) decrease in adjusted scores in the hyperbilirubinemia group. There was no significant difference between groups in the proportion of children with abnormal neurologic findings on physical examination or with documented diagnoses of neurologic abnormalities. Fourteen of the children with hyperbilirubinemia (17 percent) had 'questionable' or abnormal findings on neurologic examination, as compared with 48 controls (29 percent; P=0.05; adjusted odds ratio, 0.47; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.98; P=0.04). The frequencies of parental concern and reported behavioral problems also were not significantly different between the two groups. Within the hyperbilirubinemia group, those with positive direct antiglobulin tests had lower scores on cognitive testing but not more neurologic or behavioral problems. CONCLUSIONS: When treated with phototherapy or exchange transfusion, total serum bilirubin levels in the range included in this study were not associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants born at or near term.

A study of a low-income population with diabetes OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether literacy mediates the relationship between education and glycemic control among diabetes patients. METHODS: We measured educational attainment, literacy using the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (s-TOFHLA), and glycemic control (HbA1c) in 395 diabetes patients at a U.S. public hospital. We performed path analysis to compare two competing models to explain glycemic control. The direct effects model estimated how education was related to HbA1c; the mediational model estimated the strength of the direct relationship when the additional pathway from education to literacy to HbA1c was added. RESULTS: Both the model with a direct effect of education on HbA1c and the model with literacy as a mediator were supported by good fit to observed data. The mediational model, however, was a significant improvement, with the additional path from literacy to HbA1c reducing the discrepancy from observed data (p < 0.01). After including this path, the direct relationship between education and HbA1c fell to a non-significant threshold. CONCLUSIONS: In a low-income population with diabetes, literacy mediated the relationship between education and glycemic control. This finding has important implications for both education and health policy. Authors: Schillinger D; Barton LR; Karter AJ; Public Health Rep. 2006 May-Jun;121(3):245-54. Cost-utility analysis in a UK setting of self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes BACKGROUND: Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in type 2 diabetes patients has been shown in meta-analyses of randomized trials to improve HbA(1c) by approximately 0.4% when compared to no SMBG. However, the cost of testing supplies is high, improvements in health utility due to improved glycaemic control may be possible and cost-effectiveness has not been evaluated. METHODS: A peer-reviewed validated model projected improvements in lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), long-term costs and cost-effectiveness of SMBG versus no SMBG. Markov/Monte Carlo modelling simulated the progression of complications (cardiovascular, neuropathy, renal and eye disease). Transition probabilities and HbA(1c)-dependent adjustments came from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and other major studies. Effects of SMBG on HbA(1c) came from clinical studies, meta-analyses and population studies, but can only be considered 'moderate' levels of evidence. Costs of complications were retrieved from published sources. Direct costs of diabetes complications and SMBG were projected over patient lifetimes from a UK National Health Service perspective. Outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Depending on the type of diabetes treatment (diet and exercise/oral medications/insulin), improvements in glycaemic control with SMBG improved discounted QALYs anywhere from 0.165 to 0.255 years, with increased total costs of 1013 pounds sterlings- 2564 pounds sterlings/patient, giving 4508 pounds sterlings: 15,515 pounds sterlings/QALY gained, well within current UK willingness-to-pay limits. Results were robust under a wide range of plausible assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the moderate level of clinical evidence available to date, improvements in glycaemic control with interventions, including SMBG, can improve patient outcomes, with acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios in the UK setting.

Therapy modifications in response to poorly controlled hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus BACKGROUND: Poorly controlled cardiovascular risk factors are common. Evaluating whether physicians respond appropriately to poor risk factor control in patients may better reflect quality of care than measuring proportions of patients whose conditions are controlled. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate therapy modifications in response to poor control of hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes in a large clinical population. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study within an 18-month period in 2002 to 2003. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente of Northern California. PATIENTS: 253,238 adult members with poor control of 1 or more of these conditions. MEASUREMENTS: The authors assessed the proportion of patients with poor control who experienced a change in pharmacotherapy within 6 months, and they defined 'appropriate care' as a therapy modification or return to control without therapy modification within 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 64% of patients experienced modifications in therapy for poorly controlled systolic blood pressure, 71% for poorly controlled diastolic blood pressure, 56% for poorly controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and 66% for poorly controlled hemoglobin A1c level. Most frequent modifications were increases in number of drug classes (from 70% to 84%) and increased dosage (from 15% to 40%). An additional 7% to 11% of those with poorly controlled blood pressure, but only 3% to 4% of those with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level or hemoglobin A1c level, returned to control without therapy modification. Patients with more than 1 of the 3 conditions, higher baseline values, and target organ damage were more likely to receive 'appropriate care.' LIMITATIONS: Patient preferences and suboptimal adherence to therapy were not measured and may explain some failures to act. CONCLUSIONS: As an additional measure of the quality of care, measuring therapy modifications in response to poor control in a large population is feasible. Many patients with poorly controlled hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes had their therapy modified and, thus, seemed to receive clinically 'appropriate care' with this new quality Med. 2006 Apr 4;144(7):475-84. Contentment with quality of life among breast cancer survivors with and without contralateral prophylactic mastectomy PURPOSE: To understand psychosocial outcomes after prophylactic removal of the contralateral breast in women with unilateral breast cancer. METHODS: We mailed surveys to women with contralateral prophylactic mastectomy after breast cancer diagnosis between 1979 and 1999 at six health care delivery systems, and to a smaller random sample of women with breast cancer without the procedure. Measures were modeled on instruments developed to assess contentment with quality of life, body image, sexual satisfaction, breast cancer concern, depression, and health perception. We examined associations between quality of life and the other domains using logistic regression. RESULTS: The response rate was 72.6%. Among 519 women who underwent contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, 86.5% were satisfied with their decision; 76.3% reported high contentment with quality of life compared with 75.4% of 61 women who did not undergo the procedure (P = .88). Among all case subjects, less contentment with quality of life was not associated with contralateral prophylactic mastectomy or demographic characteristics, but was associated with poor or fair general health perception (odds ratio [OR], 7.0; 95% CI, 3.4 to 14.1); possible depression (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.1 to 9.2); dissatisfaction with appearance when dressed (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.0 to 6.0); self-consciousness about appearance (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.7); and avoiding thoughts about breast cancer (modest: OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.5; highest: OR, 1.7; 95% 0.9 to 3.2). CONCLUSION: Most women undergoing contralateral prophylactic mastectomy report satisfaction with their decision and experience psychosocial outcomes similar to breast cancer survivors without the procedure.

Effect of primary health care orientation on chronic care management PURPOSE: It has been suggested that the best way to improve chronic illness care is through a redesign of primary care emphasizing comprehensive, coordinated care as espoused by the Chronic Care Model (CCM). This study examined the relationship between primary care orientation and the implementation of the CCM in physician organizations. METHODS: The relationship between measures of primary care orientation and the CCM was examined in a sample of 957 physician organizations from the National Study of Physician Organizations, a cross-sectional telephone survey of all US medical groups and independent practice associations with 20 or more physicians (response rate, 70%). RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, 6 of 8 measures of primary care orientation were associated with physician organizations' adoption of 11 elements of CCM chronic care management. These 6 measures were severity of chronic illness treated in primary care, health promotion activity, health education activity, any accepted financial risk for hospitalization, required reporting, and presence of an electronic standardized problem list. Presence of an electronic medical record and the 5-year primary care physician turnover rate were not associated. CONCLUSIONS: Organizations that have adopted 6 core attributes of primary care, representing comprehensive health service delivery and a commitment to overall patient health, appear to use more chronic care management practices. Policy makers and other stakeholders may wish to focus on creating an improved primary care home in their quest to close the 'quality chasm' in Mar-Apr;4(2):117-23. Place of birth and variations in management of late preterm ('near-term') infants BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to characterize variations in management late preterm infants because such variations in such a large group of neonates would have economic and health implications. METHODS: Comparison of the use of illustrative management approaches and gestational age at discharge among infants born at 33 to 34 6/7 weeks and discharged alive from 10 Massachusetts and California NICUs. RESULTS: Generally similar in birth weight and admission severity, significant differences were seen in illustrative interventions, such as the use of mechanical ventilation (range in use across hospitals from 9% to 43%) and nutritional practices (use of hyperalimentation ranged from 5% to 66%). Variations in average daily weight gain were seen with some infants averaging net losses. Postmenstrual age at discharge varied by a week between the hospital with the earliest discharge and that with the latest. CONCLUSIONS: Care for these infants would be improved by further examination of their needs and the establishment of practice guidelines to reduce unneeded variation.

Short-term outcomes of infants born at 35 and 36 weeks gestation: we need to ask more questions BACKGROUND: Newborns who are 35 to 36 weeks gestation comprise 7.0% of all live births and 58.3% of all premature infants in the United States. They have been studied much less than very low birth weight infants. OBJECTIVE: To examine available data permitting quantification of short-term hospital outcomes among infants born at 35 and 36 weeks gestation. DESIGN: Review of existing published data and, where possible, re-analysis of existing databases or retrospective cohort analyses. SETTING: Multiple hospitals and neonatal intensive care units in the United States and England. PATIENTS: Premature infant cohorts with infants whose dates of birth ranged from 1/1/98 through 6/30/04. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 1) Death, 2) respiratory distress requiring some degree of in-hospital respiratory support during the birth hospitalization, and 3) rehospitalization following discharge home after the birth hospitalization. RESULTS: Newborns born at 35 and 36 weeks gestation experienced considerable mortality and morbidity. Approximately 8% required supplemental oxygen support for at least 1 hour, almost 3 times the rate found in infants born at or =37 weeks. Among 35 to 36 week newborns who progressed to respiratory failure and who survived to 6 hours of age and did not have major congenital anomalies, the mortality rate was 0.8%. Following discharge from the birth hospitalization, 35 to 36 week infants were much more likely to be rehospitalized than term infants, and this increase was evident both within 14 days as well as within 15 to 182 days after discharge. In addition, late preterm infants experienced multiple therapies, few of which have been formally evaluated for safety or efficacy in this gestational age group. CONCLUSIONS: Greater attention needs to be paid to the management of late preterm infants. In addition, it is important to conduct formal evaluations of the therapies and follow-up strategies employed in caring for these infants.

Moderately premature infants at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in California are discharged home earlier than their peers in Massachusetts and the United Kingdom OBJECTIVE: To compare gestational age at discharge between infants born at 30-34(+6) weeks gestational age who were admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in California, Massachusetts, and the United Kingdom. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Fifty four United Kingdom, five California, and five Massachusetts NICUs. SUBJECTS: A total of 4359 infants who survived to discharge home after admission to an NICU. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gestational age at discharge home. RESULTS: The mean (SD) postmenstrual age at discharge of the infants in California, Massachusetts, and the United Kingdom were 35.9 (1.3), 36.3 (1.3), and 36.3 (1.9) weeks respectively (p = 0.001). Compared with the United Kingdom, adjusted discharge of infants occurred 3.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4 to 6.5) days earlier in California, and 0.9 (95% CI -1.2 to 3.0) days earlier in Massachusetts. CONCLUSIONS: Infants of 30-34(+6) weeks gestation at birth admitted and cared for in hospitals in California have a shorter length of stay than those in the United Kingdom. Certain characteristics of the integrated healthcare approach pursued by the health maintenance organisation of the NICUs in California may foster earlier discharge. The California system may provide opportunities for identifying practices for reducing the length of stay of moderately premature infants.

Role of self-monitoring of blood glucose in glycemic control OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in the management of diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Current trends and published evidence are reviewed. RESULTS: Despite the widespread evidence that lowering glycemic levels reduces the risks of complications in patients with diabetes, little improvement in glycemic control has been noted among patients in the United States and Europe in recent years. Although SMBG has been widely used, considerable controversy surrounds its role in achieving glycemic control. The high cost of test strips has made considerations regarding appropriate recommendations for SMBG a priority, especially in light of the current climate of health-care cost-containment. Existing clinical recommendations lack specific guidance to patients and clinicians regarding SMBG practice intensity and frequency, particularly for those patients not treated with insulin. Previous studies of the association between SMBG and glycemic control often found weak and conflicting results. CONCLUSION: A reexamination of the role of SMBG is needed, with special attention to the unique needs of patients using different diabetes treatments, within special clinical subpopulations, and during initiation of SMBG versus its ongoing use. Further understanding of the intensity and frequency of SMBG needed to reflect the variability in glycemic patterns would facilitate more specific guideline development. Educational programs that focus on teaching patients the recommended SMBG practice, specific glycemic targets, and appropriate responses to various blood glucose readings would be beneficial. Continuing medical education programs for health-care providers should suggest ways to analyze patient SMBG records to tailor medication regimens. For transfer or communication of SMBG reports to the clinical staff, a standardized format that extracts key data elements and allows quick review by health-care providers would be useful. Because the practice of SMBG is expensive, the cost-effectiveness of SMBG needs to be 2006 Jan-Feb;12 Suppl 1:110-7. Gay/Lesbian sexual orientation increases risk for cigarette smoking and heavy drinking among members of a large Northern California health plan BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: Tobacco and alcohol use and related morbidity and mortality are critical public health problems. Results of several, but not all, studies suggest that lesbians and gay men are at elevated risk for smoking tobacco and alcohol misuse. METHODS: Data from random sample general health surveys of adult members of a large Northern California Health Plan conducted in 1999 and 2002 were analyzed using gender-based multivariate logistic regression models to assess whether lesbians (n = 210) and gay men (n = 331) aged 20-65 were more likely than similarly aged heterosexual women (n = 12,188) and men (n = 9342) to be smokers and heavy drinkers. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, and survey year, lesbians were significantly more likely than heterosexual women to be heavy drinkers (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.08, 4.23) and current smokers (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.02, 2.51). Among men, gays were significantly more likely than heterosexuals to be current smokers (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.75, 3.30), with borderline significant increased risk for heavy drinking (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.96, 2.45). CONCLUSION: Lesbians and gay men may be at increased risk for morbidity and mortality due to higher levels of cigarette and alcohol use. More population-based research is needed to understand the nature of substance use in these communities so that appropriate interventions can be developed.

Prediction of type 2 diabetes mellitus with alternative definitions of the metabolic syndrome: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study BACKGROUND: In addition to predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality, the metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), itself an important risk factor for CVD. Our objective was to compare the ability of various metabolic syndrome criteria (including those recently proposed by the International Diabetes Federation), markers of insulin resistance (IR) and inflammation, and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in the prediction of DM and to determine whether various proposed modifications to the National Cholesterol Education program (NCEP) metabolic syndrome definition improved predictive ability. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 822 subjects in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study aged 40 to 69 years who were nondiabetic at baseline. After 5.2 years, 148 individuals had developed DM. IGT, metabolic syndrome definitions, and IR markers all significantly predicted DM, with odds ratios ranging from 3.4 to 5.4 (all P<0.001), although there were no significant differences in the areas under the receiver operator characteristic (AROC) curves between the definitions. Modifying or requiring obesity, glucose, or IR components in NCEP-defined metabolic syndrome did not significantly alter the predictive ability of the definition under AROC curve criteria (all P>0.05). Similarly, although IR and inflammation variables were significantly associated with incident DM when included in multivariate models with NCEP-defined metabolic syndrome (all P<0.01), expanding the definition by adding these variables as components did not significantly alter the predictive ability of the definition under AROC curve criteria (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The International Diabetes Federation and NCEP metabolic syndrome definitions predicted DM at least as well as the World Health Organization definition, despite not requiring the use of oral glucose tolerance testing or measures of IR or microalbuminuria. Modifications or additions to the NCEP metabolic syndrome definition had limited impact on the prediction Dec 13;112(24):3713-21. Race, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, and quality of care for adults with diabetes enrolled in managed care: the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) study OBJECTIVE: To examine racial/ethnic and socioeconomic variation in diabetes care in managed-care settings. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 7,456 adults enrolled in health plans participating in the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes study, a six-center cohort study of diabetes in managed care. Cross-sectional analyses using hierarchical regression models assessed processes of care (HbA(1c) [A1C], lipid, and proteinuria assessment; foot and dilated eye examinations; use or advice to use aspirin; and influenza vaccination) and intermediate health outcomes (A1C, LDL, and blood pressure control). RESULTS: Most quality indicators and intermediate outcomes were comparable across race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position (SEP). Latinos and Asians/Pacific Islanders had similar or better processes and intermediate outcomes than whites with the exception of slightly higher A1C levels. Compared with whites, African Americans had lower rates of A1C and LDL measurement and influenza vaccination, higher rates of foot and dilated eye examinations, and the poorest blood pressure and lipid control. The main SEP difference was lower rates of dilated eye examinations among poorer and less educated individuals. In almost all instances, racial/ethnic minorities or low SEP participants with poor glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control received similar or more appropriate intensification of therapy relative to whites or those with higher SEP. CONCLUSIONS: In these managed-care settings, minority race/ethnicity was not consistently associated with worse processes or outcomes, and not all differences favored whites. The only notable SEP disparity was in rates of dilated eye examinations. Social disparities in health may be reduced in managed-care settings. Authors: Brown AF; 2005 and racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes after acute myocardial infarction: a cohort study among members of a large integrated health care delivery system in northern California BACKGROUND: Previous studies have documented sex and racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but the explanation of these disparities remains limited. In a setting that controls for access to medical care, we evaluated whether sex and racial/ethnic disparities in prognosis after AMI persist after consideration of socioeconomic background, personal medical history, and medical management. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of the members (20,263 men and 10,061 women) of an integrated health care delivery system in northern California who had experienced an AMI between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2002, and were followed up for a median of 3.5 years (maximum, 8 years). Main outcome measures included AMI recurrence and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: In age-adjusted analyses relative to white men, black men (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-1.65), black women 1.26-1.72), and Asian women (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.13-1.65) were at increased risk of AMI recurrence. However, multivariate adjustment for sociodemographic background, comorbidities, medication use, angiography, and revascularization procedures effectively removed the excess risk of AMI recurrence in these 3 groups. Similarly, the increased age-adjusted risk of all-cause mortality seen in black men (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.37-1.75) and black women (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.27-1.66) was greatly attenuated in black men and reversed in black women after full multivariate adjustment. CONCLUSION: In a population with equal access to medical care, comprehensive consideration of social, personal, and medical factors could explain sex and racial/ethnic disparities in prognosis Oct 10;165(18):2105-13. Pre-pregnancy and pregnancy-related factors and the risk of excessive or inadequate gestational weight gain OBJECTIVE: Gestational weight gain consistent with the Institute of Medicine's recommendations is associated with better maternal and infant outcomes. The objective was to quantify the effect of pre-pregnancy factors, pregnancy-related health conditions, and modifiable pregnancy factors on the risks of inadequate and excessive gestational weight gain. METHOD: A longitudinal cohort of pregnant women (N=1100) who completed questions about diet and weight gain during pregnancy and delivered a singleton, full-term infant. RESULTS: Gestational weight gain was inadequate for 14% and excessive for 53%. Pre-pregnancy factors contributed 74% to excessive gain, substantially more than pregnancy-related health conditions (15%) and modifiable pregnancy factors (11%). Pre-pregnancy factors, pregnancy-related health conditions, and modifiable pregnancy factors contributed fairly equally to the risk of inadequate gain. CONCLUSION: Interventions to prevent excessive gestational gain may need to start before pregnancy. Women at risk for inadequate gain would also benefit from interventions directed toward modifiable factors during 2005 Nov;91(2):125-31. Epub 2005 Oct 3. Current evidence regarding the value of self-monitored blood glucose testing Many people with diabetes are falling short of attaining or maintaining glycemic goals. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is among the many strategies proposed to address the problem. SMBG complements hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing by providing specific information regarding the effects of diet, exercise, and medications on glycemia. Although the importance of self-monitoring is appreciated for insulin-using patients, evidence is still emerging in support of self-monitoring for patients with type 2 diabetes managed with oral agents or diet. Evaluating the available evidence requires a good understanding of the study design and methodology. Although several clinical trials involving SMBG have been insufficiently powered to detect clinically meaningful differences in HbA1c, recent meta-analyses have reproducibly supported the benefit of self-monitoring in non-insulin-treated patients. Although additional work is needed to establish optimal frequency and timing of SMBG, these studies can serve as a basis for conservative recommendations to guide patients and their healthcare providers.

A national survey OBJECTIVE: Disease registries are lists of patients with a particular chronic illness, including clinical information, to improve the care of individuals and populations. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of disease registries in physician organizations and the extent to which they are used to improve care. DESIGN: A cross-sectional national telephone survey with a response rate of 70%. SETTING: All physician organizations in the United States with 20 physicians or more. PARTICIPANTS: Chief executive officers, presidents, or medical directors of 1040 physician organizations. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of organizations reported having a registry for at least 1 chronic illness, with diabetes registries being the most common. Half (51%) of the registries were not linked to clinical data. Organizations with at least 1 registry were more likely to have implemented other chronic care improvements (P < .0001). Factors associated with the presence of registries in physician organizations include external incentives for quality and extent of information technology capabilities. CONCLUSIONS: Disease registries are not utilized by half of physician organizations. This finding is disturbing because registries have the potential to catalyze needed improvement in chronic Med. 2005 Sep;20(9):855-8. Pioglitazone initiation and subsequent hospitalization for congestive heart failure AIMS: Thiazolidinediones (TZD) have been associated with an expansion in plasma volume and the development of peripheral oedema. A recent study reported an association between the use of TZDs and development of congestive heart failure (CHF). The objective of this study was to determine if short-term use of pioglitazone, a TZD, is associated with increased risk of admission to hospital because of CHF in a well-characterized, community-based cohort of Type 2 diabetic patients without prevalent CHF. METHODS: A cohort study of all patients in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program with Type 2 diabetes (Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry) who initiated any diabetes pharmacotherapy (n = 23 440) between October 1999 and November 2001. Only patients initiating single new therapies ('new users') were included to reduce confounding and create mutually exclusive exposure groups. We constructed Cox proportional hazards models (with sulphonylureas initiators specified as the reference group) to evaluate the impact of initiating new diabetes therapies on time-to-incident admission to hospital because of CHF, defined by primary hospital discharge diagnosis. RESULTS: Patients (15.2%), sulphonylureas (25.3%), metformin (50.9%), and insulin (8.6%) alone, or as additions to pre-existing or maintained therapies. Three hundred and twenty admissions for CHF were observed during the follow-up (mean 10.2 months) after drug initiation. Relative to patients initiating sulphonylureas, there were no significant increases in the incidence of hospitalization for CHF in those initiating pioglitazone [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.28; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85-1.92] after adjusting for demographic, behavioural and clinical factors. There was a significantly higher incidence among those initiating insulin (HR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.00-2.45) and lower incidence = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.49-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: This study of patients with Type 2 diabetes failed to find evidence that short-term pioglitazone use was associated with an elevated risk of hospitalization for CHF relative to the standard, first-line diabetes Med. 2005 Aug;22(8):986-93. Tobacco-cessation services and patient satisfaction in nine nonprofit HMOs BACKGROUND: The U.S. Public Health Service clinical practice guideline calls for clinicians and healthcare organizations to identify and treat every tobacco user seen in a healthcare setting. There is little information on the extent of compliance with the guideline's treatment model described by the '5A's' (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange). METHODS: In 1999-2000 a survey was mailed to 64,764 members aged 25 to 75 years, of nine nonprofit HMOs participating in the National Cancer Institute-funded Cancer Research Network. These plans provide medical care to more than 8 million Americans including a minority enrollment of 30%. Smokers were asked about tobacco-cessation treatments received during primary care visits in the past year. RESULTS: A 70% response rate identified a smoking prevalence of 10% (n=4207). Results indicated that 90% of smokers were asked about smoking, 71% were advised to quit, 56% were assessed for their willingness to quit, 49% received assistance interventions, and 9% had follow-up arranged. Treatment was provided more often to smokers who asked for help and/or intended to quit. Few and only modest associations were found between other patient characteristics and receipt of 5A's cessation services. In contrast to widely reported concerns about smokers' resistance to tobacco interventions, smokers who received treatment were more satisfied with health plan services. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate substantial clinician compliance with the first two steps-Ask and Advise. Greater efforts are needed in providing the more effective tobacco treatments-Assist and Arrange. Compliance with the guideline is associated with greater patient satisfaction.

Care-seeking behavior in response to emergency department copayments BACKGROUND: Patients are increasingly paying for more of their medical care through cost-sharing, yet little is known about how patients change the ways that they seek care in response. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess how patients change their care-seeking behavior in response to emergency department (ED) copayments. RESEARCH DESIGN: Telephone interviews with a stratified random sample of adult members of a large integrated delivery system. SUBJECTS: There were 932 respondents (72% response rate). MEASURES: We examined participants' knowledge of their copayment level for ED services, and measures of how the cost-sharing affected their decisions about where or when to seek care. RESULTS: Overall, 82% of participants faced a copayment for ED services (ranging between 5 US dollars and 100 US dollars), and 41% correctly reported the amount of this copayment. In response to the perceived copayment amount, 19% reported changing their care-seeking behavior within the previous 12 months: 12% sought care from an alternate delivery site, 12% contacted a provider by telephone or the Internet, 9% delayed going to the ED, and 2% avoided medical care altogether. In multivariate models, the ED cost-sharing amount was significantly associated with reporting changes in care-seeking behavior. CONCLUSIONS: When faced with an ED copayment, patients in the health system most commonly shifted toward seeking care from other available alternatives, and rarely avoid medical care altogether.

Efficacy of breast cancer screening in the community according to risk level BACKGROUND: The efficacy of breast cancer screening in the community may differ from that suggested by the results of randomized trials, and no data have been available on efficacy among women who have different levels of breast cancer risk. METHODS: We conducted a matched case-control study among women enrolled in six health plans in Washington, Oregon, California, Massachusetts, and Minnesota. We examined the efficacy of screening by mammography and/or clinical breast examination among women in two age cohorts (40-49 years and 50-65 years) and in two breast cancer risk levels (average and increased risk). Women who died from breast cancer from January 1, 1983, through December 31, 1998, (N = 1351; case subjects) were matched to control subjects (N = 2501) on age and risk level. Increased risk was defined as a family history of breast cancer or a breast biopsy noted in the medical records before the index date (defined as date of first suspicion of breast abnormalities in case subjects, with the same date used for matched control subjects). Data on screening, risk status, and other variables were abstracted from medical records. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the association between breast cancer mortality and receipt of screening. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: There were small, non-statistically significant associations between breast cancer mortality and receipt of screening during the 3 years prior to the index date for both the younger women [odds ratio (OR) = 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.76 to 1.13] and the older women (OR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.12). The association among women at increased risk (OR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.50 to 1.03) was stronger than that among women at average risk (OR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.80 to 1.14), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .17). CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based study, screening history was not associated with breast cancer mortality. However, potential limitations of this study argue for a cautious interpretation of these findings. Authors: Elmore JG; Geiger AM; Fletcher SW; et al. Cancer Inst. 2005 Jul 20;97(14):1035-43. Efficacy of prophylactic mastectomy in women with unilateral breast cancer: a cancer research network project PURPOSE: We investigated the efficacy of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) in reducing contralateral breast cancer incidence and breast cancer mortality among women who have already been diagnosed with breast cancer. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study comprised approximately 50,000 women who were diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer during 1979 to 1999. Using computerized data confirmed by chart review, we identified 1,072 women (1.9%) who had CPM. We obtained covariate information for these women and for a sample of 317 women who did not undergo CPM. RESULTS: The median time from initial breast cancer diagnosis to the end of follow-up was 5.7 years. Contralateral breast cancer developed in 0.5% of women with CPM, metastatic disease developed in 10.5%, and subsequent breast cancer developed in 12.4%; 8.1% died from breast cancer. Contralateral breast cancer developed in 2.7% of women without CPM, and 11.7% died of breast cancer. After adjustment for initial breast cancer characteristics, treatment, and breast cancer risk factors, the hazard ratio (HR) for the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer after CPM was 0.03 (95% CI, 0.006 to 0.13). After adjustment for breast cancer characteristics and treatment, the HRs for the relationship of CPM with death from breast cancer, with death from other causes, and with all-cause mortality were 0.57 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.72), 0.78 (95% CI, 0.57 to 1.06), and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.72), respectively. CONCLUSION: CPM seems to protect against the development of contralateral breast cancer, and although women who underwent CPM had relatively low all-cause mortality, CPM also was associated with decreased breast cancer mortality.

OBJECTIVE: To assess how observational studies on neonatal sepsis can help define the knowledge base required for neonatal randomized, clinical trials. DESIGN: Methodologic review of past observational studies and critical reviews. RESULTS: Observational studies on neonatal sepsis have suffered from important limitations: failure to employ multivariate analyses, considering infection in isolation (ignoring coexisting respiratory distress), failure to provide likelihood ratios for predictors and combinations of predictors, and ignoring the phenomenologic dimension of clinicians' experience. CONCLUSION: Future observational studies must address three key issues. They should begin with a clear analytic and sampling plan that pays careful attention to the proper use and reporting of multivariate analyses. Second, they must explicitly address two subpopulations: critically ill newborns with negative cultures and asymptomatic newborns with positive cultures. Finally, they should be theory driven and provide empirical physiologic data that permit situating their results in the context of the evolving systemic inflammatory response syndrome and PIRO (predisposition, infection, host response, organ dysfunction) models.

Abdominal obesity predicts declining insulin sensitivity in non-obese normoglycaemics: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) AIM: Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated a relationship between obesity and insulin sensitivity (S(I)); however, there is a lack of evidence from longitudinal studies. METHODS: The Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) estimated S(I) (x10(-4)/min.microU/ml) directly using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test with minimal model analysis in 504 normoglycaemic subjects. Partial correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to compare the relationship of change in S(I) from baseline to 5 years later (DeltaS(I)) with baseline waist circumference (waist) as a measure of abdominal obesity and body mass index (BMI) as a measure of overall obesity. Mean DeltaS(I) was -1.06 (SD = 1.85). RESULTS: Higher baseline waist (r = -0.16; p = 0.0005), but not BMI (r = -0.005; p = 0.91), was associated with (-) DeltaS(I) in models including sex, ethnicity, clinical centre and baseline S(I), BMI, waist, age and physical activity. The waist-DeltaS(I) relationship differed across the levels of baseline BMI, being significant only in normal weight (r = -0.21) and overweight subjects (r = -0.16), but not in obese subjects. DeltaS(I) was correlated with a 5-year change in either obesity measure (Deltawaist: r = -0.22 and DeltaBMI: r = -0.20; p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Among non-diabetics, waist circumference was a strong predictor of declining S(I) among lean subjects, a modest predictor among overweight subjects, but was not predictive among obese individuals. Waist circumference should be considered, in addition to BMI, when identifying individuals at high risk of diabetes or the insulin resistance syndrome. May;7(3):230-8. Trends in severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates between 1994 and 2002 OBJECTIVE: To examine temporal trends in the rates of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) between 1994 and 2002. STUDY DESIGN: In a retrospective cohort study, all infants with a gestational age (GA) <33 weeks in a large managed care organization were identified. Annual rates of BPD (defined as an oxygen requirement at 36 weeks corrected GA), severe BPD (defined as respiratory support at 36 weeks corrected GA), and death before 36 weeks corrected GA were examined. RESULTS: Of the 5115 infants in the study cohort, 603 (12%) had BPD, including 246 (4.9%) who had severe BPD. There were 481 (9.5%) deaths before 36 weeks corrected GA. Although the decline in BPD in this period was not significant, the rates of severe BPD declined from 9.7% in 1994 to 3.7% in 2002. Controlling for gestational age, the odds ratio (95% CI) for annual rate of decline in severe BPD was 0.890 (0.841-0.941). Controlling for gestational age, deaths before 36 weeks corrected GA also declined, with the odds ratio (CI) for the annual decline being 0.944 (0.896-0.996). CONCLUSIONS: In this study population, the odds of having of BPD remained constant after controlling for GA. However, the odds of having severe BPD declined on average 11% per year between 1994 and Authors: Apr;146(4):469-73. Achieving good glycemic control: initiation of new antihyperglycemic therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of antihyperglycemic therapies in type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycemic control (baseline glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1C] > 8%). STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal (cohort) study. METHODS: Study patients were 4775 type 2 diabetic patients who initiated new antihyperglycemic therapies and maintained them for up to 1 year. The study setting was Kaiser Permanente Northern California Medical Group, an integrated, prepaid, healthcare delivery organization. Treatment regimens were 1 or more of the following: insulin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, biguanides (metformin), or other less frequently used options (including meglitinides or alpha-glucosidase inhibitors). RESULTS: In this cohort, the mean HbA1C was 9.9% when therapy was initiated. Within 1 year, there was a drop of 1.3 percentage points in the mean HbA1C (to 8.6%), and 18% of new initiators achieved HbA1C values of < or = 7%. After adjusting for baseline clinical differences, the proportion of patients treated to goal was greatest among those receiving thiazolidinediones in combination (24.6%-25.7%) or a regimen of metformin and insulin (24.9%), while the least success was experienced by those receiving sulfonylureas alone (12.5%) or insulin-sulfonylureas regimens (10.9%). The probability of achieving the target goal was most strongly predicted by the level of glycemic control before initiation, but patient behaviors (eg, frequent self-monitoring, lower rates of missed appointments) also were strongly associated with greater levels of control. CONCLUSION: Overall, therapy initiation resulted in an impressive population-level benefit. However, since most new initiators still had not achieved good control within 12 months, careful monitoring and prompt therapy intensification remain important. Authors: Karter A population-based study of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy efficacy in women at elevated risk for breast cancer in community practices BACKGROUND: Findings from several studies suggest that bilateral prophylactic mastectomy reduces breast cancer incidence by 90% or more, but the studies used highly selected patients from referral centers, and the comparison groups were not population based. We studied the efficacy of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy in women with elevated breast cancer risk cared for in community practices. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-cohort study of women aged 18 to 80 years with 1 or more breast cancer risk factors (family history of breast cancer, history of atypical hyperplasia, or > or =1 breast biopsies with benign findings). Using computerized data and medical records, we identified 276 women with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and a stratified random sample of 196 women representing an underlying cohort of 666 800 women with elevated breast cancer risk without prophylactic mastectomy, and then we determined who developed breast cancer. RESULTS: Breast cancer developed in 1 woman (0.4%) after bilateral prophylactic mastectomy vs 26 800 women (4.0%) without prophylactic mastectomy. Stratifying by birth year, the hazard ratio for breast cancer occurrence after bilateral prophylactic mastectomy was 0.005 (95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.044). No woman with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy died of breast cancer vs a calculated 0.2% of women without prophylactic mastectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy reduced breast cancer incidence in women at elevated risk for breast cancer cared for in community-based practices. However, the absolute risk of breast cancer incidence and death in women who did not undergo the procedure in these settings was relatively low.

Prevalence of motor abnormalities among healthy 5-year old children The prevalence of motor examination abnormalities among a general pediatric population is unknown. We determined the frequency of motor abnormalities noted at five years of age during a neurologic examination by a child neurologist. As part of a follow-up study of neonatal jaundice in a population of 106,627 births, we randomly selected 419 five-year-old children as healthy controls, of whom 168 consented. Child neurologists blinded to the children's history performed standard neurologic examinations to determine the presence of definite or subtle motor abnormalities. Standardized data on motor and cognitive function were also obtained. Among eight (5%) children diagnosed with a definite motor abnormality, the most common finding was corticospinal tract dysfunction (four unilateral, two bilateral). Two children demonstrated hypotonia and hyporeflexia, one of whom also exhibited proximal weakness. An additional 12 (7%) children were noted to have subtle motor findings that were not clearly abnormal, such as subtle incoordination, mild dystonic posturing, tremor, posting, or hyperreflexia. Children with definite or subtle motor findings were more likely to receive an abnormal score on the Motor Performance Checklist (57% vs. 32%, P = 0.02). There was also a trend towards these children having a lower mean verbal IQ compared to children with normal motor examinations (95.3 vs. 102.1, P = 0.07). Motor examination abnormalities in otherwise healthy 5-year-old children may be more common than previously thought. However, the proportion of children with motor examination abnormalities who have an unrecognized neurologic disorder remains unknown. Authors: Pediatr Neurol. 2005;3(3):141-6. Body mass index, provider advice, and target gestational weight gain OBJECTIVE: To study the relationships among prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), women's target gestational weight gain, and provider weight gain advice. METHODS: Project WISH, the acronym for Women and Infants Starting Healthy, is a longitudinal cohort study of pregnant women in the San Francisco Bay area. We excluded subjects with preterm birth, multiple gestation, or maternal diabetes. RESULTS: Among overweight women (prepregnancy BMI 26.1-29.0), 24.1% reported a target weight gain above the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines, compared with 4.3% of normal weight women (P .001). Among women with a low prepregnancy BMI ( 19.8), 51.2% reported a target weight gain below the guidelines, compared with 10.4% of normal weight women (P .001). These patterns persisted in a multivariate analysis. Latina ethnicity, lower maternal education, low prepregnancy BMI ( 19.8), lack of provider advice about weight gain, and provider advice to gain below guidelines were all independently associated with a target weight gain below IOM guidelines. Prepregnancy BMI more than 26, multiparity, lower age, and provider advice to gain above guidelines were all associated with a target gain above IOM guidelines. CONCLUSION: Women's beliefs about the proper amount of weight gain and provider recommendations for weight gain vary significantly by maternal prepregnancy BMI. Many women report incorrect advice about gestational weight gain, and women with high or low prepregnancy BMI are more likely to have an incorrect target weight gain. New approaches to provider education are needed to implement the IOM guidelines for gestational weight gain. Authors: of all gestations AIM: To analyse rehospitalisation of newborns of all gestations. METHODS: A total of 33,276 surviving infants of all gestations born between 1 October 1998 and 31 March 2000 at seven Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program (KPMCP) delivery services were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: Rehospitalisation rates within two weeks after nursery discharge ranged from 1.0% to 3.7%. The most common reason for rehospitalisation was jaundice. Among babies > or =34 weeks, the most important factor with respect to rehospitalisation was use of home phototherapy. Among babies who were not rehospitalised for jaundice, African-American race (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.56), and having a scheduled outpatient visit (AOR = 0.73) or a home visit (AOR = 0.59) within 72 hours after discharge were protective. Factors associated with increased risk were: being small for gestational age (AOR = 1.83), gestational age of 34-36 weeks without admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (AOR = 1.65), Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology, version II, > or =10 (AOR = 1.95), male gender (AOR = 1.24), having both a home as well as a clinic visit within 72 hours after discharge (AOR = 1.84), and birth facility (range of AORs = 1.52-2.36). Asian race was associated with rehospitalisation (AOR = 1.49) when all hospitalisations were considered, but this association did not persist if hospitalisations for jaundice were excluded. CONCLUSIONS: In this insured population with access to integrated care, rehospitalisation rates for jaundice were strongly affected by availability of home phototherapy and by follow up. For other causes, moderate prematurity and follow up visits played a large role, but variation between centres persisted even after controlling for multiple factors. Future research should include development of better process measures for evaluation of follow up strategies. Authors: Feb;90(2):125-31. Case-control single-marker and haplotypic association analysis of pedigree data Related individuals collected for use in linkage studies may be used in case-control linkage disequilibrium analysis, provided one takes into account correlations between individuals due to identity-by-descent (IBD) sharing. We account for these correlations by calculating a weight for each individual. The weights are used in constructing a composite likelihood, which is maximized iteratively to form likelihood ratio tests for single-marker and haplotypic associations. The method scales well with increasing pedigree size and complexity, and is applicable to both autosomal and X chromosomes. We apply the approach to an analysis of association between type 2 diabetes and single-nucleotide polymorphism markers in the PPAR-gamma gene. Simulated data are used to check validity of the test and examine power. Analysis of related cases has better power than analysis of population-based cases because of the increased frequencies of disease-susceptibility alleles in pedigrees with multiple cases compared to the frequencies of these alleles in population-based cases. Also, utilizing all cases in a pedigree rather than just one per pedigree improves power by increasing the effective sample size. We demonstrate that our method has power at least as great as that of several competing methods, while offering advantages in the ability to handle missing data and perform factors with serum bilirubin levels to predict hyperbilirubinemia in newborns OBJECTIVES: (1) To validate a previously reported risk index for predicting total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels of 25 mg/dL (428 micromol/L) or higher; (2) to combine a subset of this index with TSB levels measured at less than 48 hours to predict subsequent TSB levels of 20 mg/dL (342 micromol/L) or higher. DESIGN: Nested case-control study using electronic and paper records (study 1). Retrospective cohort study using electronic records only (study 2). SETTING: Northern California Kaiser Permanente hospitals. PATIENTS: Subjects for both studies were newborns weighing 2000 g or more and of 36 weeks' or more gestation. The validation study included 67 cases born 1997-1998 who developed TSB levels of 25 mg/dL or higher at less than 30 days and 208 randomly selected control subjects. Subjects for study 2 were 5706 newborns who both were discharged from the hospital and had a TSB level measured at less than 48 hours. RESULTS: The risk index performed similarly in the validation group, born in 1997-1998, and the derivation group, born in 1995-1996 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.83 vs 0.84). Of the 5706 newborns with TSB levels measured before 48 hours, 270 (4.7%) developed a TSB level of 20 mg/dL or higher. Of these, 254 (94%) had a TSB level at the 75th percentile or higher at less than 48 hours. The risk index improved prediction over the TSB level alone, largely owing to the effect of gestational age. For example, for those with a TSB level at the 95th percentile or higher at less than 48 hours, the risk increased from 9% for newborns born at 40 weeks' or more gestation to 42% for those born at 36 weeks. CONCLUSION: Clinical risk factors significantly improve prediction of subsequent hyperbilirubinemia compared with early TSB levels alone, especially in those with early TSB levels above the 75th percentile.

Looking for Trouble in All the Right Places: The Legal Implications Associated with 'Electronic Signatures' and High-risk Clinical Situations Background: Voluntary reporting systems identify only a fraction of medical errors. Electronic identification mechanisms, which are more efficient, have been defined for adverse drug events. However, similar systems are lacking for other types of errors. Objective: The investigators sought to define probabilistic strategies that could support quality improvement and medical error detection by decreasing the need for unselected manual chart review. Design: Combinations of administrative data and laboratory test results ('electronic signatures') were employed to identify discrete, high-risk clinical situations among health plan members of a large managed care organization. The design used was a retrospective cohort study linking hospitalization records, outpatient records, and laboratory results that were formatted using approaches developed for physiologic severity scoring. The original outcomes of interest for the study were clinical situations (e.g., birth injuries or delayed diagnosis of myocardial infarction) that have a strong association with human error. Results: When presented with preliminary results, senior leaders in the investigators' parent organizations raised a number of objections to any public presentation or publication of the results. Because of these objections, the quantitative results presented in this report focus on rapid detection of one outcome-prolonged neonatal assisted ventilation-that has a weak association with human error. Using recursive partitioning, the investigators were able to define subsets of newborns for whom the frequency of the outcome of interest was substantially higher than in the general population (1 percent). For example, an electronic signature identified a subset of infants (comprising 4 percent of the birth cohort) in which the outcome of interest occurred in 22 percent of the newborns. Conclusions: Use of probabilistic electronic strategies could yield significant benefits in medical error research as well as major operational improvements in medical error detection and reporting, quality assurance, and quality improvement. However, three barriers are likely to limit the use of such 'electronic signatures'-fear of malpractice litigation, fear of lawsuits invoking 'enterprise liability,' and high development costs. Entities most likely to benefit from these approaches are those with a critical mass of experienced personnel, a circumstance that can spread the development costs over a large number of hospitals and/or clinics.

Disparities and survival among breast cancer patients BACKGROUND: Although rates of survival for women with breast cancer have improved, the survival disparity between African American and white women in the United States has increased. PURPOSE: To determine whether this survival disparity persists in an insured population with access to medical care. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted data from the tumor registries of six nonprofit, integrated health care delivery systems affiliated with the Cancer Research Network and assessed the survival of African American (n = 2276) and white (n = 18 879) female enrollees who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1998. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the death rate among African American women relative to that of white women after adjustment for potential explanatory factors including stage at diagnosis, tumor characteristics, and treatment. RESULTS: Five-year survival was lower for African American women (73.8%) than for white women (81.6%). African American women were less likely to have tumor characteristics with good prognosis. Controlling for age at diagnosis, stage, grade, tumor size, and estrogen and progesterone receptor status, the adjusted hazard rate ratio for African American women was 1.34 (95% confidence interval = 1.22 to 1.46). Similar risks were found among women ages 20-49 and 50 and older. Controlling for treatment slightly lowered the hazard rate ratio to 1.31 (95% confidence interval = 1.20 to 1.43). CONCLUSIONS: Among women with invasive breast cancer, being insured and having access to medical care does not eliminate the survival disparity for African American women.

Building a research consortium of large health systems: the Cancer Research Network Critical questions about cancer prevention, care, and outcomes increasingly require research involving large patient populations and their care delivery organizations. The Cancer Research Network (CRN) includes 11 integrated health systems funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to conduct collaborative cancer research. This article describes the challenges of constructing a productive consortium of large health systems, and explores the CRN's responses. The CRN was initially funded through an NCI cooperative agreement in 1999 and has since received a second 4-year grant. Leadership and policy development are provided through a steering committee, subcommittees, and an external advisory committee. The CRN includes integral and affiliated research projects supported by a Scientific and Data Resources Core. Three characteristics of the CRN intensified the general challenges of consortium research: 1) its members are large health systems with legitimate concerns about confidentiality of data about enrollees, providers, and the organization; 2) CRN research projects often generate highly sensitive data about quality of care; and therefore 3) each participating organization wants a strong voice in CRN direction. CRN experience to date confirms that a consortium of health systems with internal research capacity can address a range of important cancer research questions that would be difficult to study in other venues. The advantages and challenges of consortium research are explored, with suggestions for the development, execution, and management of multisystem population laboratories.

Use of dietary supplements by female seniors in a large Northern California health plan BACKGROUND: Women aged >or= 65 years are high utilizers of prescription and over-the-counter medications, and many of these women are also taking dietary supplements. Dietary supplement use by older women is a concern because of possible side effects and drug-supplement interactions. The primary aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive picture of dietary supplement use among older women in a large health plan in Northern California, USA, to raise awareness among health care providers and pharmacists about the need for implementing structural and educational interventions to minimize adverse consequences of self-directed supplement use. A secondary aim was to raise awareness about how the focus on use of herbals and megavitamins that has occurred in most surveys of complementary and alternative therapy use results in a significant underestimate of the proportion of older women who are using all types of dietary supplements for the same purposes. METHODS: We used data about use of different vitamin/mineral (VM) supplements and nonvitamin, nonmineral (NVNM) supplements, including herbals, from a 1999 general health survey mailed to a random sample of adult members of a large Northern California health plan to estimate prevalence of and characteristics associated with supplement use among women aged 65-84 (n = 3,109). RESULTS: Based on weighted data, 84% had in the past 12 months used >1 dietary supplement, 82% a VM, 59% a supplement other than just multivitamin or calcium, 32% an NVNM, and 25% an herbal. Compared to white, nonHispanic women, African-Americans and Latinas were significantly less likely to use VM and NVNM supplements and Asian/Pacific Islanders were less likely to use NVNM supplements. Higher education was strongly associated with use of an NVNM supplement. Prevalence did not differ by number of prescription medications taken. Among white, nonHispanic women, multiple logistic regression models showed that college education, good health, belief that health practices have at least a moderate effect on health, and having arthritis or depression significantly increased likelihood of NVNM use, while having diabetes decreased likelihood. CONCLUSIONS: An extremely high proportion of older women are using dietary supplements other than multivitamins and calcium, many in combination with multiple prescription medications. Increased resources should be devoted to helping clinicians, pharmacists, supplement vendors, and consumers become more aware of the safety, effectiveness, and potential side effects of dietary supplements.

Race and ethnicity: comparing medical records to self-reports Understanding and eliminating health disparities requires accurate data on race/ethnicity. To assess the quality of race/ethnicity data, we compared medical record classifications to self-report of a study of prophylactic mastectomy. A total of 788 women had race/ethnicity from both sources; 69.9% were 55 years of age or older, 38.3% were at least college graduates, and 67.8% were married or living with someone. There were 817 race/thnicity classifications for the 788 women, of which 758 (92.3%) were identical in the medical record and self-report. Sensitivity and positive predictive value were high (86.7%-97.2%) for whites, Asians, and blacks and moderate (64.0% and 68.1%) for Latinas. However, only one of 18 Native Americans was correctly identified in her medical record. Our results indicate that even if the overall accuracy of medical record classifications for race/ethnicity is high, such a finding may obscure substantial inaccuracies in the recording for racial/ethnic minorities, especially Latinas and Native Americans.

BACKGROUND: Although most American women regularly receive screening clinical breast examination (CBE), little is known about CBE accuracy in community practice. We sought to estimate the rate of cancer detection (sensitivity) of screening CBE performed by community-based clinicians on women who ultimately died of breast cancer, as well as to identify factors associated with accurate detection. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We evaluated CBE accuracy among asymptomatic female health plan enrollees in five states (WA, OR, CA, MA, and MN) who received a CBE within 1 year of breast cancer diagnosis and who died of breast cancer within 15 years of diagnosis (N = 485). Sensitivity was estimated as the proportion whose exam was abnormal. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses identified patient characteristics associated with cancer detection. RESULTS: An abnormality was noted on screening CBE in one of five women who ultimately succumbed to breast cancer (sensitivity = 21.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 18.1% to 25.6%). The odds of a true-positive screening CBE (sensitivity) were decreased among women using estrogen (odds ratio [OR] = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.80), receiving a Pap smear during the same visit as CBE (OR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.27 to 0.72), and with increasing chronic disease comorbidity (P(trend) = .08). CONCLUSION: Screening CBE as performed in the community may be insufficiently sensitive to detect most lethal breast cancers. Low sensitivity of screening CBE in community practice may be partly attributable to its performance alongside time-consuming clinical tasks such as Pap smear screening or chronic illness care. Authors: bilateral prophylactic mastectomy BACKGROUND: Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy significantly decreases breast cancer risk, but complications of the procedure have only been described in single-site studies. We describe the frequency and type of complications in women who underwent bilateral prophylactic mastectomy in a multisite community-based cohort. METHODS: Women aged 18-80 years undergoing bilateral prophylactic mastectomy without a personal history of breast cancer at one of six health plans were eligible. We identified women from automated data sources, then reviewed hospital data, ambulatory notes, and other chart elements to confirm eligibility and obtain all charted information about complications and surgeries performed after prophylactic mastectomy, including reconstructive procedures. Reconstructions were characterized by type (implant vs. tissue graft). Complications were noted for a 1-year period after any surgical procedure. RESULTS: We identified 269 women with prophylactic mastectomy who were followed for a mean of 7.4 years. Their mean age was 44.9 years. Nearly 80% undertook reconstruction, most with prosthetic implants. One or more complications occurred in 64%. The most common complications were pain (35% of women), infection (17%), and seroma (17%). Women with no reconstruction had fewer complications (mean of .93) than women who had implant (2.0) or tissue graft (2.4) reconstruction procedures (differences from no reconstruction: 1.07 [95% confidence interval = 0.36 to 1.77] and 1.50 [95% confidence interval = 0.44 to 2.56] respectively). Delay of reconstruction after mastectomy was associated with a borderline-significant higher risk of complications (80.6%) compared to simultaneous reconstruction (64.0%, P = .055). CONCLUSION: We found that almost two-thirds of women undergoing bilateral prophylactic mastectomy had at least one complication following surgery. Further work should be done to minimize and to understand the effect of complications of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. Authors: Barton mastectomy (CPM) is the removal of a nonaffected breast in a woman with unilateral breast cancer and is effective in reducing the risk of recurrences. Little is known about women's decision-making roles regarding CPM. METHODS: Women aged 18-80 years with CPM performed at one of six health maintenance organizations between 1979 and 1999 were surveyed. We determined women's reported decision-making roles at the time of CPM, analyzed their trends over time, and explored the association between decision-making roles and psychosocial outcomes following CPM. RESULTS: We received 562 responses (response rate = 73%); 431 completed items needed for this analysis. Most respondents were white, younger than 55 years at CPM, married, and had CPM within 10 years of completing the survey. Forty-five percent made the decision to undergo CPM alone, 37% considered their doctor's opinion, 15% shared the decision with their doctor and only 3% reported their doctor primarily made the decision. Women reporting active roles were more likely to be younger (P<.0008), college educated (P<.0001) and have CPM more recently (P = .002). Compared with those sharing the decision with their doctors, women with active roles were twice as likely to be satisfied 6 months following CPM (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 4.2) and report current concern about breast cancer (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.0 to 3.4). CONCLUSIONS: Most women reported active or shared roles in decision making regarding CPM, particularly younger women, those with college education, and those with recent CPM. Women with active roles were more often satisfied in the short term but were also more likely to report current concern about breast cancer. Whether higher concern is related to insufficient input from clinicians should be explored. Prospective data are needed. Authors: Nekhlyudov L; Altschuler Inst Monogr. 2005;(35):55-60. Changes in the health status of women during and after pregnancy OBJECTIVE: To characterize the changes in health status experienced by a multi-ethnic cohort of women during and after pregnancy. DESIGN: Observational cohort. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women from 1 of 6 sites in the San Francisco area (N=1,809). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Women who agreed to participate were asked to complete a series of telephone surveys that ascertained health status as well as demographic and medical factors. Substantial changes in health status occurred over the course of pregnancy. For example, physical function declined, from a mean score of 95.2 prior to pregnancy to 58.1 during the third trimester (0-100 scale, where 100 represents better health), and improved during the postpartum period (mean score, 90.7). The prevalence of depressive symptoms rose from 11.7% prior to pregnancy to 25.2% during the third trimester, and then declined to 14.2% during the postpartum period. Insufficient money for food or housing and lack of exercise were associated with poor health status before, during, and after pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Women experience substantial changes in health status during and after pregnancy. These data should guide the expectations of women, their health care providers, and public policy.

Prepregnancy health status and the risk of preterm delivery BACKGROUND: Despite extensive evaluation, our understanding of risk factors for premature delivery is incomplete. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a woman's health status and risk factors before pregnancy are associated with a woman's risk of preterm delivery, independent of risk factors that occur during pregnancy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort of pregnant women in the San Francisco Bay area who delivered a singleton infant (n = 1619). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Preterm delivery (37 weeks' gestational age). RESULTS: Sociodemographic characteristics alone explained 13.0% of the risk of preterm delivery, whereas risk factors that occurred before pregnancy explained 39.8% and risk factors that occurred during pregnancy explained 47.1%. After we adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, prepregnancy risk factors, and pregnancy risk factors, women who reported poor physical function during the month before conception were nearly twice as likely to experience a preterm delivery (odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.30) as women with better physical function. CONCLUSION: A broader focus on the health of women prior to pregnancy may improve rates of preterm delivery. Authors: Haas Adolesc Med. 2005 Jan;159(1):58-63. Relationship between tobacco control policies and the delivery of smoking cessation services in nonprofit HMOs BACKGROUND: This project examined tobacco policies and delivery of cessation services in nonprofit HMOs that collectively provide comprehensive medical care to more than 8 million members. METHODS: Three annual surveys with health plan managers showed that all of these health plans had written tobacco control guidelines that became more comprehensive over the span of this study. We also surveyed a random sample of 4207 current smokers who had attended a primary care visit in the past year (399-528 at each of nine health plans). RESULTS: Of these smokers, 71% reported advice to quit, 56% were asked about their willingness to quit, 49% were provided some assistance in quitting (mostly self-help material or information about classes or counseling), and 9% were offered some kind of follow-up. Smokers receiving assistance in quitting reported higher satisfaction with their care. CONCLUSIONS: In general, health plans with the most comprehensive policies also showed higher rates of implementing tobacco treatment programs in primary care. Compared with tobacco control efforts of a decade or more ago, considerable progress has been made. However, there is still room for improvement in the proportion of smokers who receive the most effective forms of assistance in quitting.

Richardson score predicts short-term adverse respiratory outcomes in newborns >/=34 weeks gestation OBJECTIVES: To develop a model to predict which newborns >/=34 weeks gestation with respiratory distress will die or will require prolonged (>3 days) assisted ventilation. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using data from Northern California newborns >/=34 weeks gestation who presented with respiratory distress. We split the cohort into derivation and validation datasets. Bivariate and multivariate data analyses were performed on the derivation dataset. After developing a simple score on the derivation dataset, we applied it to the original as well as to a second validation dataset from Massachusetts. RESULTS: Of 2276 babies who met our initial eligibility criteria, 203 (9.3%) had the primary study outcome (assisted ventilation >3 days or death). A simple score based on gestational age, the lowest PaO 2 /FIO 2 , a variable combining lowest pH and highest PaCO 2 , and the lowest mean arterial blood pressure had excellent performance, with a c-statistic of 0.85 in the derivation dataset, 0.80 in the validation dataset, and 0.80 in the secondary validation dataset. CONCLUSIONS: A simple objective score based on routinely collected physiologic predictors can predict respiratory outcomes in infants >/=34 weeks gestation with respiratory distress. Authors: Escobar obstetric complications associated with macrosomia OBJECTIVE: Macrosomia is associated with adverse maternal outcomes. The objective of this study was to characterize the epidemiology of macrosomia and related maternal complications. METHOD: Live births (146,526) were identified between 1995 and 1999 in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program's Northern California Region (KPMCP NCR) database. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed for risk factors and complications associated with macrosomia (birth weight 4500 g). RESULT: Male infant sex, multiparity, maternal age 30-40, white race, diabetes, and gestational age 41 weeks were associated with macrosomia (p0.001). In bivariate and multivariate analyses, macrosomia was associated with higher rates of cesarean birth, chorioamnionitis, shoulder dystocia, fourth-degree perineal stay (p0.01). CONCLUSION: Macrosomia was associated with adverse maternal outcomes in this cohort. More research is needed to determine how to prevent complications related to excessive birth weight. Authors: Stotland NE; Perinatal in children with motor a population-based study OBJECTIVE: Risk factors for perinatal arterial stroke (PAS) are poorly understood. Most previous studies lack an appropriate control group and include only infants with symptoms in the newborn period. We set out to determine prenatal and perinatal risk factors for PAS. METHODS: In a population-based, case-control study nested within the cohort of 231 582 singleton infants who were born at >or=36 weeks' gestation in Northern California Kaiser hospitals from 1991 to 1998, we searched electronically for children with motor impairment and reviewed their medical records to identify diagnoses of PAS. Control subjects were randomly selected from the study population. A medical record abstractor reviewed delivery records without knowledge of case status. RESULTS: The prevalence of PAS with motor impairment was 17/100,000 live births. Of 38 cases, 26 (68%) presented after 3 months of age with hemiparesis or seizures. All 12 newborns with acute stroke symptoms had seizures. A delayed presentation was more common in children with moderate to severe motor impairment than among infants with only mild motor abnormalities (24 of 31 vs 2 of 7). Prepartum risk factors significantly associated with PAS in multivariate analysis were preeclampsia (odds ratio [OR]: 3.6; 95% 5.3; 95% CI: 1.5-18.6). Newborns with PAS were also at higher risk of delivery complications, such as emergency cesarean section intrauterine (IUGR) may be independent risk factors for perinatal stroke resulting in motor impairment. Large multicenter studies that include all children with perinatal stroke are needed to determine further the risk factors and outcome of perinatal stroke. Authors: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in high-risk clinical and ethnic groups with diabetes BACKGROUND: Diabetes causes 45% of incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Risk of progression is higher in those with clinical risk factors (albuminuria and hypertension), and in ethnic minorities (including blacks, Asians, and Latinos). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy, yet little is known about their use among patients at high risk for progression to ESRD. OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence of ACE or ARB (ACE/ARB) use overall and within patients with high-risk clinical indications, and to assess for ethnic disparities in ACE/ARB use. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Diabetes Registry, a longitudinal registry that monitors quality and outcomes of care for all KPNC patients with diabetes. PATIENTS: Individuals (N= 38887) with diabetes who were continuously enrolled with pharmacy benefits during the year 2000, and had self-reported ethnicity data on survey. INTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENTS: Pharmacy dispensing of ACE/ARB. RESULTS: Forty-one percent of the cohort had both hypertension and albuminuria, 30% had hypertension alone, and 12% had albuminuria alone. Fourteen percent were black, 11% Latino, 13% Asian, and 63% non-Latino white. Overall, 61% of the cohort received an ACE/ARB. ACE/ARB was dispensed to 74% of patients with both hypertension and albuminuria, 64% of those with hypertension alone, and 54% of those with albuminuria alone. ACE/ARB was dispensed to 61% of whites, 63% of blacks, 59% of Latinos, and 60% of Asians. Among those with albuminuria alone, blacks were significantly (P =.0002) less likely than whites to receive ACE/ARB (47% vs 56%, respectively). No other ethnic disparities were found. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, the majority of eligible patients received indicated ACE/ARB therapy in 2000. However, up to 45% to 55% of high-risk clinical groups (most notably individuals with isolated albuminuria) were not receiving indicated therapy. Additional targeted efforts to increase use of ACE/ARB could improve quality of care and reduce ESRD incidence, both overall and in high-risk ethnic groups. Policymakers might consider use of ACE/ARB for inclusion in diabetes performance measurement sets. Authors: Rosen AB; Karter AJ; Liu JY; Selby J Gen Intern Med. 2004 Jun;19(6):669-75. Rehospitalization in the first year of life among infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia OBJECTIVE: To describe rates and identify risk factors for rehospitalization during the first year of life among infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of infants born at a gestational age (GA) <33 weeks, between 1995 and 1999. BPD was defined as requirement of supplemental oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation at 36 weeks' corrected GA. The outcome was rehospitalization for any reason before first birthday. RESULTS: In the first year of life, 118 of 238 (49%) infants with BPD were rehospitalized, more than twice the rate of rehospitalization of the non-BPD population, which was 309 of 1359 (23%) (P=<.0001). No measured factor discriminated between those infants with BPD who were and were not rehospitalized, even when only rehospitalizations for respiratory diagnoses were considered. CONCLUSIONS: Among premature infants, BPD substantially increases the risk of rehospitalization during the first year of life. Neither demographic nor physiologic factors predicted rehospitalization among the infants with BPD. Other factors, such as air quality of home environment, passive smoking exposure, respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis, breast-feeding status, and/or parenting and primary care management styles, should be examined in future studies.

Differences in insulin resistance in nondiabetic subjects with isolated impaired glucose tolerance or isolated impaired fasting glucose Both impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (as defined by the 1985 World Health Organization criteria) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (as defined by the 1997 American Diabetes Association criteria) represent intermediate metabolic states between normal and diabetic glucose homeostasis. Cardiovascular disease may be related to postglucose load rather than fasting glycemia, i.e., IGT rather than IFG. We hypothesized that subjects with IGT may be more insulin resistant and have higher levels of common cardiovascular risk factors than those with isolated IFG. In the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS), we studied S(i) and first-phase insulin secretion (acute insulin response [AIR]), as derived from a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, as well as common cardiovascular risk factors in four different glucose tolerance categories (NFG/NGT [n vs. 42.0 pmol/l; 18.1 vs. 215.9 +/- +/- 0.3 vs. 1.49 +/- 0.5 mg/l; P = 0.0015), and higher triglyceride levels (137.7 +/- 5.5 vs. 108.4 +/- 8.9 mg/dl; = 0.0025) than subjects with isolated fasting hyperglycemia (IFG/NGT). The relation of insulin resistance to glucose tolerance category was consistently seen in women and men and across the three ethnic groups of the IRAS (non-Hispanic whites, African Americans, and Hispanics). Nondiabetic individuals with isolated postchallenge hyperglycemia (IGT) are more insulin resistant than individuals with isolated fasting hyperglycemia (IFG). The risk factor pattern (including increased insulin resistance) seen in isolated IGT identifies a subgroup of nondiabetic individuals who are likely to benefit from early Comparing breast cancer case identification using HMO computerized diagnostic data and SEER data OBJECTIVE: To determine the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of computerized diagnostic data from health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in identifying incident breast cancer cases. STUDY DESIGN: An HMO without a cancer registry developed an algorithm identifying incident breast cancer cases using computerized diagnostic codes. Two other HMO sites with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries duplicated this case-identification approach. Using the SEER registries as the criterion standard, we determined the sensitivity and PPV of the computerized data. METHODS: Data were collected from HMO computerized data-bases between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 1999. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data were also used. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of the HMO databases was between 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-0.96) 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98-0.99). Sensitivity was high (range, 0.94-0.98), for the first 3 (of 4) years, dropping slightly (range, 0.81-0.94) in the last year. The overall PPV ranged from 0.34 (95% CI, 0.32-0.35) to 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46). Positive predictive value rose sharply (range, 0.18-0.20) after the first year to 0.83 and 0.92 in the last year because prevalent cases were excluded. Review of a random sample of 50 cases identified in the computerized data-bases but not by SEER data indicated that, while SEER usually identified the cases, the registry did not associate every case with the health plan. CONCLUSIONS: Health maintenance organization computerized databases were highly sensitive for identifying incident breast cancer cases, but PPV was low in the initial year because the systems did not differentiate between prevalent and incident cases. Health maintenance organizations depending solely on SEER data for cancer case identification will miss a small percentage of cases. Authors: Rolnick J Manag Care. 2004 Apr;10(4):257-62. Cost-sharing: patient knowledge and effects on seeking emergency department care BACKGROUND: The use of cost-sharing to control healthcare expenditures is increasing, but there is scant information about patients' knowledge of cost-sharing or its influence on behavior. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate what patients know about their individual levels of cost-sharing and how it influences decisions to seek care. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey with a 69% response rate. SUBJECTS: We studied a stratified random sample of 695 adult patients in an integrated delivery system: 266 subjects > or =65 years, 218 low-income subjects, and 211 subjects from the overall membership. MEASURES: We used perceived and actual levels of copayments for emergency department (ED) visits, office visits, and prescription drugs; and self-reports of copayment-related behavior changes. RESULTS: One third of subjects correctly reported their ED copayment, whereas three fourths correctly reported their prescription drug and office visit copayments. Over half of the subjects (57%) underestimated their ED copayment by $20 or more. Among patients who reported having any copayment, 11% described changing their behavior because of the copayment, ie, delayed or avoided emergency care. The perceived copayment level was strongly associated with behavior change (odds ratio, 3.9). Other significant factors included having more ED visits in the past 12 months and having a low health status. CONCLUSIONS: Patients have less knowledge of their ED cost-sharing levels than for other services. The perceived copayment amount was strongly associated with avoidance of or delays in emergency care. Further research is needed to determine whether these responses reflect greater efficiency or harmful decisions. Authors: Hsu J; Reed M; Brand R; Selby JV Med Care. 2004 Mar;42(3):290-6. Tuberculosis in California dialysis patients SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northern California dialysis registry. OBJECTIVE: To examine the incidence of tuberculosis disease (TB) in a large, insured population of dialysis patients and to describe the disease characteristics and outcomes of these cases. DESIGN: Cohort study of all Kaiser patients who initiated dialysis between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 1999. TB incidence in our cohort between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2000 was determined through electronic databases of out-patient diagnoses, laboratory results, and pharmacy records. The incidence of TB in the general population was determined from mandatory reporting of TB cases compiled by the California Department of Health Services. RESULTS: During the 6-year period of observation, 13 cases of TB occurred among 2806 dialysis initiators. The incidence of TB in the dialysis cohort was 134 per 100,000 person-years, compared to an incidence of 11.9/100,000 in the California population, yielding a relative risk of 11.3. Extra-pulmonary disease occurred in eight of 11 patients for whom site of disease was recorded. Five of 13 patients died within 3 months of TB diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The dialysis population is at high risk of TB. Physicians caring for dialysis patients must remain vigilant for signs of TB in this vulnerable population.

Use of thiazolidinediones and risk of heart failure in people with type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study: response to Delea author High rates of co-occurrence of hypertension, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus in a large managed care population OBJECTIVE: To examine prevalence and co-occurrence of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (dyslipidemia, or DL) in a managed care population. STUDY DESIGN: Period prevalence study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population included all adults (age > 20 years) who had been members of Kaiser Permanente, Northern California, for at least 4 months on December 31, 2001 (n = 2.1 million). Criteria from the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of Hypertension, the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, and the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Registry were applied to computerized databases for an 18-month period to identify HT, DL, and DM, respectively. Because screening for these conditions is incomplete, we applied age- and sex-specific prevalence estimates from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to simulate full ascertainment. RESULTS: Unadjusted prevalence rates of HT, DL, and DM were 23.8%, 17.6%, and 6.6%, respectively. More than 50% of persons with either HT or DL also had at least 1 other condition. Of all persons with DM, 74% had HT, 73% had DL, and 56% had both. Under full ascertainment, prevalence increased to 27.6%, 35.6%, and 8.7% for HT, DL, and DM, respectively, and co-occurrence increased further. CONCLUSION: HT, DL, and DM co-occur in most affected individuals. To avoid fragmentation of care, disease management strategies should aim to manage these conditions within the same programs.

Missed appointments and poor glycemic control: an opportunity to identify high-risk diabetic patients OBJECTIVE: When patients miss scheduled medical appointments, continuity and effectiveness of healthcare delivery is reduced, appropriate monitoring of health status lapses, and the cost of health services increases. We evaluated the relationship between missed appointments and glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin or HbA1c) in a large, managed care population of diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Missed appointment rate was related cross-sectionally to glycemic control among 84,040 members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry during 2000. Adjusted least-square mean estimates of HbA1c were derived by level of appointment keeping (none missed, 1-30% missed, and >30% missed appointments for the calendar year) stratified by diabetes therapy. RESULTS: Twelve percent of the subjects missed more than 30% of scheduled appointments during 2000. Greater rates of missed appointments were associated with significantly poorer glycemic control after adjusting for demographic factors (age, sex), clinical status, and health care utilization. The adjusted mean HbA1c among members who missed >30% of scheduled appointments was 0.70 to 0.79 points higher (P <0.0001) relative to those attending all appointments. Patients who missed more than 30% of their appointments were less likely to practice daily self-monitoring of blood glucose and to have poor oral medication refill adherence. CONCLUSION: Patients who underuse care lack recorded information needed to determine level of risk. Frequently missed appointments were associated with poorer glycemic control and suboptimal diabetes self-management practice, are readily ascertained in clinical settings, and therefore could have clinical utility as a risk-stratifying criterion indicating the need for targeted case management.

Retention of enrollees following a cancer diagnosis within health maintenance organizations in the Cancer Research Network Population laboratories with complete clinical information on episodes of care are needed to support research on the quality of care delivered to cancer patients. Data resources within the Cancer Research Network (CRN) may overcome many of the limitations of existing cancer databases, but their potential clinical value depends on the stability of the enrolled population. To assess this issue, we studied the retention rates among survivors of the 132 580 patients diagnosed with cancer from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1998, who were enrolled at five health maintenance organization sites participating in the CRN. Enrollees were followed from cancer diagnosis through death, disenrollment, or the end of follow-up (i.e., December 31, 1999). The retention rate among survivors for all cancers combined at 1 and 5 years after cancer diagnosis was 96.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 95.9% (95% CI = 83.4% to 84.3%), respectively. The proportion of enrollees diagnosed with cancer who remained enrolled and available for evaluation suggests that the CRN is well-suited for studies of the quality of care for cancer patients, survivorship, and long-term outcomes.

Use of complementary and alternative medicine by the adult membership of a large northern California health maintenance organization, 1999 Data from general health surveys completed by random samples of adult members of a large Northern California health maintenance organization in 1996 and 1999 were used to investigate (a) the prevalence of use of 15 complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities by adult members in 1999, (b) how prevalence varied by age group and gender, and (c) which modalities were increasing in popularity. While Northern California is not representative of the nation as a whole, it tends to be a harbinger of trends to come. The most widely used modalities in 1999 were herbal and other nonvitamin/nonmineral nutritional supplements, prayer/spiritual healing done by oneself, chiropractic, massage therapy, and mind-body medicine modalities. However, use of the different modalities varied significantly by age and gender, and rates of use of nutritional supplements and the manipulatives were approximately doubled, when restricted to subpopulations at high risk, for use because of relevant health conditions. There appeared to be a statistically significant, but modest increase in CAM use, mostly due to a large increase in use of nutritional supplements. Implications for how CAM use should be tracked for ambulatory care populations and the importance of addressing nutritional supplement use in ambulatory clinical care are discussed.

Socioeconomic position and health among persons with diabetes mellitus: a conceptual framework and review of the literature Authors: AF; study of systemic and local complications of toe prostheses We investigated the role of toe implants in systemic disease and evaluated local complications after foot surgery. Information was obtained from the medical records of Kaiser Permanente (northern California) patients who had undergone toe surgery between 1979 and 1988. Computerized hospitalization records were used to identify patients with toe implants (N=814) and matched controls with foot surgery not involving implants (N=837). Brain cancer and alopecia areata occurred more among implant patients, whereas dysphagia occurred more among nonimplant patients. A larger proportion of implant patients were diagnosed with pain and swelling, tendonitis, and osteomyelitis or periostitis. Nonimplant patients were more often diagnosed with derangement of foot or ankle and delayed postoperative healing. We did not find a general association between implants and connective Orthop (Belle Mead NJ). 2003 Dec;32(12):585-92. Chorioamnionitis and cerebral palsy in term and near-term infants CONTEXT: Half of all cases of cerebral palsy (CP) occur in term infants, for whom risk factors have not been clearly defined. Recent studies suggest a possible role of chorioamnionitis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether clinical chorioamnionitis increases the risk of CP in term and near-term infants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Case-control study nested within a cohort of 231 582 singleton infants born at 36 or more weeks' gestation between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1998, in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, a managed care organization providing care for more than 3 million residents of northern California. Case patients were identified from electronic records and confirmed by chart review by a child neurologist, and comprised all children with moderate to severe spastic or dyskinetic CP not due to postnatal brain injury or developmental abnormalities (n = 109). Controls (n = 218) were randomly selected from the study population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Association between clinical chorioamnionitis and increased risk of CP in term and near-term infants. RESULTS: hemiparesis (40%) or quadriparesis (38%); 87% had been diagnosed by a neurologist and 83% had undergone neuroimaging. Chorioamnionitis, considered present if a treating physician made a diagnosis of chorioamnionitis or endometritis clinically, was noted in 14% of cases and 4% of controls (odds ratio [OR], 3.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-10.1; P =.001). Independent risk factors identified in multiple logistic regression included chorioamnionitis (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.6-10.1), intrauterine growth restriction (OR, 95% 1.3-12.0), maternal black ethnicity (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4-9.3), maternal age older than 25 years 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.2), and nulliparity is 11%. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that chorioamnionitis is an independent risk factor for CP among term and near-term nonmineral supplement use over a 12-month period by adult members of a large health maintenance organization OBJECTIVE: National survey data show an increase in the prevalence of nonvitamin, nonmineral (NVNM) supplement use among adults over the past 10 years. Concern over this trend is based in part on reports of potential drug-supplement interactions. The type and prevalence of supplement use by demographic and behavior characteristics were examined among members of a large group model health plan, including those with selected health conditions. DESIGN: Data on the use of herbal medicines and dietary supplements among survey respondents were analyzed. Questions employed a checklist for six specific NVNM supplements with optional write-ins. SUBJECTS/SETTING: A stratified random sample of 15,985 adult members of a large group model health maintenance organization in northern California, who were respondents to a 1999 general health survey. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Analyses were conducted with poststratification weighted data to reflect the actual age, gender, and geographic distribution of the adult membership from which the sample was drawn. RESULTS: An estimated 32.7% of adult health plan members used at least one NVNM supplement. The most frequently used herbs were Echinacea (14.7%) and Gingko biloba (10.9%). Use of all NVNM supplements was highest among females, 45 to 64 years of age, whites, college graduates, and among those with selected health conditions. APPLICATIONS: Dietetics professionals need to uniformly screen clients for dietary supplement use and provide accurate information and appropriate referrals to users.

Low insulin sensitivity (S(i) = 0) in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects in the insulin resistance atherosclerosis study: is it associated with components of the metabolic syndrome and nontraditional risk factors? OBJECTIVE: To determine the meaning of S(i) = 0 derived from the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The issue of assessing insulin resistance in large studies is important because the most definitive method ('gold standard'), the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, is expensive and invasive. The frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGTT) has been widely used, but in insulin-resistant subjects (especially diabetic subjects), it yields considerable numbers of subjects whose S(i) is zero. The interpretation of an S(i) equaling zero is unknown. RESULTS: -To address this issue, we examined 1482 subjects from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) using an insulin-modified FSIGTT and minimal model calculation of S(i). The proportion insulin-resistant subjects (S(i) < 1.61 x 10(-4) [min(-1). microU(-1) x ml(-1)] based on the median of the nondiabetic population) was 38.6% in subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 74% in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 92% in subjects with type 2 diabetes. The proportion of subjects with S(i) = 0 was 2.2% in subjects with NGT, 13.2% in subjects with IGT, and 35.7% in subjects with type 2 diabetes. In subjects with IGT, those with S(i) = 0 had significantly lower HDL cholesterol levels and higher BMI, waist circumference, fibrinogen, plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1 levels than insulin-resistant subjects with S(i) > 0. In type 2 diabetes, subjects with S(i) = 0 had significantly greater BMI and waist circumference and higher triglyceride, PAI-1, CRP, fibrinogen, and fasting and 2-h insulin levels than insulin-resistant subjects with S(i) > 0. In addition, diabetic subjects with S(i) = 0 had more metabolic disorders related to the insulin resistance syndrome than diabetic insulin-resistant subjects with S(i) > 0. CONCLUSIONS: We found very few subjects with S(i) = 0 among subjects with NGT and few subjects with S(i) = 0 among subjects with IGT. In contrast, S(i) = 0 was common in subjects with diabetes. Subjects with S(i) = 0 tended to have more features of the insulin resistance syndrome than other insulin-resistant subjects with S(i) > 0, as would be expected of subjects with almost no insulin-mediated glucose disposal, thus suggesting that subjects with S(i) = 0 are correctly classified as being very insulin resistant rather than having failed the minimal model program.

Health behaviors and quality of care among Latinos with diabetes in managed care OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether ethnicity and language are associated with diabetes care for Latinos in managed care. METHODS: Using data from 4685 individuals in the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) Study, a multicenter study of diabetes care in managed care, we constructed multivariate regression models to compare health behaviors, processes of care, and intermediate outcomes for Whites and English- and Spanish-speaking Latinos. RESULTS: Latinos had lower rates of self-monitoring of blood glucose and worse glycemic control than did Whites, higher rates of foot self-care and dilated-eye examinations, and comparable rates of other processes and intermediate outcomes of care. CONCLUSIONS: Although self-management and quality of care are comparable for Latinos and Whites with diabetes, important ethnic disparities persist in the managed care settings studied.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increase beyond 37 weeks of gestation and to address how best to analyze these rates. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of all women delivered beyond 37 weeks' gestational age from 1995 to 1999 at all Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program delivery hospitals in Northern California. Rates of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia were calculated by use of both pregnancy delivered (PD) and ongoing pregnancy (OP) as the denominator. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted with use of P<.05 to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: Among the 135,560 women in this cohort, the rates of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia were the same or decreased from 37 to 43 weeks' gestation using PD, but all three increased when calculated according to OP (P<.01). CONCLUSION: We found that among complications of pregnancy that are diagnosed ante partum, use of a different denominator led to contradictory conclusions. When hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are analyzed, ongoing pregnancies should be used as the denominator. Authors: Caughey AB; Regarding 'a case-control study of and diabetes preventive services: the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) study OBJECTIVE: Despite the increased shifting of health care costs to consumers, little is known about the impact of financial barriers on health care utilization. This study investigated the effect of out-of-pocket expenditures on the utilization of recommended diabetes preventive services. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a survey-based observational study (2000-2001) in 10 managed care health plans and 68 provider groups across the U.S. serving approximately 180,000 patients with diabetes. From 11,922 diabetic survey respondents, we studied the occurrence of self-reported annual dilated eye exams and diabetes health education and among insulin users, daily self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Conditional probabilities were estimated for outcomes at each level of self-reported out-of-pocket expenditure by using hierarchical logistic regression models with random intercepts. RESULTS: Conditional probabilities of utilization (95% CI) varied by expenditure for dilated eye exam [no (49-68); P < 0.0001]. Extensive adjustment for patient factors had no discernible effect on the estimates or their significance, and cost-utilization relationships were similar across income levels and other patient characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Benefit packages structured to derive greater fiscal contribution from the health plan membership result in suboptimal use of diabetes preventive services and may thus lead to poorer clinical outcomes, greater future costs, and lower health plan quality ratings.

Clinician support and psychosocial risk factors associated with breastfeeding discontinuation OBJECTIVE: Breastfeeding rates fall short of goals set in Healthy People 2010 and other national recommendations. The current, national breastfeeding continuation rate of 29% at 6 months lags behind the Healthy People 2010 goal of 50%. The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between breastfeeding discontinuation at 2 and 12 weeks postpartum and clinician support, maternal physical and mental health status, workplace issues, and other factors amenable to intervention. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted of low-risk mothers and infants who were in a health maintenance organization and enrolled in a randomized, controlled trial of home visits. Mothers were interviewed in person at 1 to 2 days postpartum and by telephone at 2 and 12 weeks. Logistic regression modeling was performed to assess the independent effects of the predictors of interest, adjusting for sociodemographic and other confounding variables. RESULTS: Of the 1163 mother-newborn in 1007 initiated breastfeeding, were and 646 (55%) were breastfeeding at the 12-week interview. In the final multivariate models, breastfeeding discontinuation at 2 weeks was associated with lack of confidence in ability to breastfeed at the 1- to 2-day interview (odds ratio [OR]: 1.2-1.9). Mothers were much less likely to discontinue breastfeeding at 12 weeks postpartum if they reported (during the 12-week interview) having received encouragement from 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.8). Breastfeeding discontinuation at 12 weeks was also associated with demographic factors and maternal depressive symptoms (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.01-1.37) and returning to postpartum (OR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.8-3.3). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that support from clinicians and maternal depressive symptoms are associated with breastfeeding duration. Attention to these issues may help to promote breastfeeding continuation among mothers who initiate. Policies to enhance scheduling flexibility and privacy for breastfeeding mothers at work or school may also be important, given the elevated risk of discontinuation associated with return to work or school.

Patient knowledge and awareness of hypertension is suboptimal: results from a large health maintenance organization Patient knowledge and awareness of hypertension are important factors in achieving blood pressure control. To examine hypertensive patients' knowledge of their condition, the authors randomly surveyed 2500 hypertension patients from a large health maintenance organization; questionnaires were supplemented with clinic blood pressure measurements. Approximately 72% of the subjects completed surveys. Of patients with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] > or =140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] > or =90 mm Hg), only 20.2% labeled their blood pressure as 'high' and 38.4% as 'borderline high'. Forty percent of respondents couldn't recall their most recent clinic-based SBP and DBP values. Overall, 71.7% and 61% were unable to report a target SBP or DBP, respectively, or identify elevated targets based on the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) criteria. Most patients perceived DBP to be a more important risk factor than SBP. Hypertensive patients awareness of blood pressure targets and current hypertension control status, particularly with respect to SBP, is suboptimal. The authors' findings support the need to improve patient education for better management of hypertension.

Use of antibiotics is not associated with decreased risk of myocardial infarction among patients with diabetes OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between exposure to antibiotic treatment and risk of subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A case-control design was used to assess the effect of previous antibiotic exposure in diabetes patients with acute, nonfatal or fatal MI (case subjects) and individually matched control subjects (four control subjects to one case subject, matched on sex, age, and index date). Subjects were sampled from the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Registry, a well-characterized, ethnically diverse diabetic population from Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, Northern California Region. MI events were ascertained during a 2-year observation period (1998-1999). Separate conditional logistic regression models were specified to assess antibiotic exposure history (cephalosporins only, penicillins only, macrolides only, quinolones only, sulfonamides only, tetracyclines only, as well as more than one, any, or no antibiotic) for three nested windows before the index date (0-6 months, 0-12 months, 0-24 months), facilitating assessment of whether the potential effect was dependent on the timing of the exposure. RESULTS: A total of 1,401 MI case subjects were observed. Odds ratios were calculated in models adjusted for age, sex, race, education attainment, time since diabetes diagnosis, diabetes type and treatment, use of diet and exercise, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride levels, hypertension, elevated urinary albumin excretion, serum creatinine, BMI, and smoking. We found no evidence of a protective effect of any of these therapeutic classes of antibiotics during any of the three time frames. CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not support the hypothesis that use of antibiotics has a protective effect for prevention of coronary heart disease in diabetic patients. ethnicity: vital constructs for diabetes research Authors: Karter AJ Diabetes Care. 2003 Jul;26(7):2189-93. Diabetes and progression of carotid atherosclerosis: the insulin resistance atherosclerosis study OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the rate of progression of carotid atherosclerosis in persons with normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, and undiagnosed and diagnosed type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) is an observational cohort study in which 1192 men and women were examined at a 5-year interval. Participants of 3 ethnic groups (non-Hispanic white, African American, and Hispanic) were selected from the general population to represent a range of glucose tolerance. Baseline and follow-up ultrasound studies were obtained to estimate progression of common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) intimal-medial thickness (IMT). Baseline glucose tolerance status was defined by an oral glucose tolerance test and World Health Organization criteria. In persons with normal glucose tolerance, progression of CCA IMT was 3.8 microm/y, and ICA IMT, 17.7 microm/y. In both CCA and ICA, progression of IMT, unadjusted for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, was approximately twice the rate in persons with diabetes than in those with normal or impaired glucose tolerance. Adjustment for CVD risk factors attenuated these differences somewhat in both sites of the carotid artery. Persons with undiagnosed diabetes had a greater ICA IMT progression rate than did persons with diagnosed diabetes (33.9 microm/y vs 26.6 microm/y, P=NS). Progression rates did not differ between persons with normal and impaired glucose tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Progression of carotid atherosclerosis is accelerated in persons with diabetes. Progression of ICA IMT is most pronounced in persons with undiagnosed diabetes. Early identification of diabetes and CVD risk factor control might reduce 17. Infants with bilirubin levels of 30 mg/dL or more in a large managed care organization OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence, etiology, treatment, and outcome of newborns with total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels >or=30 mg/dL (513 micro mol/L). DESIGN: Population-based case series. SETTING: Eleven Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program hospitals and 1 affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Eleven infants with TSB levels of >or=30 mg/dL in the first 30 days after birth, identified using computer databases from a cohort of 111,009 infants born 1995-1998. OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data from the birth hospitalization, rehospitalization, and outpatient visits in all infants; psychometric testing at age 5 (N = 3), neurologic examinations by child neurologists at age 5 (N = 3), or primary care providers (N = 7; mean age: 2.2 years); Parent Evaluation of Developmental Status (N = 8; mean age: 4.2 years). RESULTS: Maximum TSB levels of the 11 infants ranged from 30.7 to 45.5 mg/dL (525 micro mol/L mg/dL [597 micro mol/L]). Four were born at 35 to 36 weeks gestation, and 7 were exclusively breastfed. Two had apparent isoimmunization; the etiology for the other 9 remained obscure, although only 4 were tested for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and 1 was bacteremic. None had acute neurologic symptoms. All received phototherapy and 5 received exchange transfusions. One infant died of sudden infant death syndrome; there was no kernicterus at autopsy. Two were lost to follow-up but were neurologically normal when last seen for checkups at 18 and 43 months. One child was receiving speech therapy at age 3. There were no significant parental concerns or abnormalities in the other children. CONCLUSIONS: In this setting, TSB levels >or=30 mg/dL were rare and generally unaccompanied by acute symptoms. Although we did not observe serious neurodevelopmental sequelae in this small sample, additional studies are required to quantify the known, significant risk of kernicterus in infants with very high TSB levels.

A computerized system to facilitate medical record abstraction in cancer research (United States) OBJECTIVE: To implement a computerized system to gather and transmit medical record information from six sites to a centralized database for two cancer prevention studies. METHODS: Microsoft Access 97 was selected as the application for the system. Sites purchased Access and hardware meeting technical specifications required for the system. A developer worked with the lead investigator and medical record abstractors to develop a 'back-end' database to hold the desired data while maintaining a user-friendly 'front-end' interface. Abstractors trained on a paper version of the abstraction form were then trained to use the system. Meeting minutes and technical notes were used in summarizing the approach and process. Observations were collected through discussions. RESULTS: We overcame multiple obstacles to develop computerized systems supporting medical record data collection at multiple sites. Although system development slowed implementation of the study, the system produced data for cleaning and analysis immediately. Overall the approach decreased the time from study implementation to manuscript submission. Development time for a second system was substantially reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Computerized systems for medical record abstraction at multiple sites convey substantial benefit. We present a schematic approach to facilitate development of similar systems in the future. Authors: Geiger AM; Cancer Causes Control. 2003 Jun;14(5):469-76. Differences in LDL oxidizability by glycemic status: the insulin resistance atherosclerosis study OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences in LDL oxidizability by glycemic status within the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study cohort. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: LDL oxidizability (lag time and oxidation rate) after exposure to copper was compared among 352 subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, and known type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, clinic, ethnicity, sex, and smoking status, LDL oxidation rates differed by glycemic status (P = 0.001), with a strong trend (P = 0.0001) for reduced LDL oxidation rate with increasing extent and duration of glucose intolerance (2,378 +/- 54, 2,208 +/- 65, [mean +/- SE] for NGT, IGT, newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, and known type 2 diabetes, respectively). Differences in LDL oxidation rate among groups were relatively unaltered by adjustment for lipids and lipoproteins, hypertension, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and remained significant even after further adjustment for dietary antioxidants and fatty acids, as well as medications. LDL lag times differed marginally by glycemic status (P = 0.058), with similar values for NGT, IGT, and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (57-60 min) but higher values for known type 2 diabetes (65 +/- 2). These differences were eliminated by further adjustment for lipids and lipoproteins, hypertension, BMI, and WHR. CONCLUSIONS: We found that glycemic status influenced LDL oxidizability, with a paradoxical reduction in LDL oxidizability, as indicated by a lower LDL oxidation rate with increased extent and duration of glucose intolerance. This difference was only slightly attenuated by adjustment for relevant demographic, metabolic, dietary, and pharmacological factors that potentially influence LDL Care. 2003 May;26(5):1449-55. Phototherapy use in jaundiced newborns in a large managed care organization: do clinicians adhere to the guideline? OBJECTIVE: In 1994, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published a practice guideline with age-specific thresholds for phototherapy for healthy term newborns with hyperbilirubinemia. The purpose of this study was to examine adherence to the guideline in a large managed care organization. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of linked computerized databases from 11 Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program hospitals. Newborn infants included were at least 37 weeks of gestation, had birth weights of at least 2500 g, and were born between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996. The primary outcome variable for the study was receipt of phototherapy according to the guideline. Total serum bilirubin (TSB) and infant age in hours at the time of bilirubin measurement were used to classify infants into 3 groups according to the AAP guideline: recommend phototherapy (R), consider phototherapy (C), and did not recommend phototherapy (N). Group R included infants with TSB levels of at least 15 mg/dL before 48 hours of age, at least 18 mg/dL before 72 hours, or at least 20 mg/dL after 72 hours. Group C included infants not in group R, with TSB levels of at least 12 mg/dL before 48 hours, 15 mg/dL before 72 hours, or at least 17 mg/dL after 72 hours. Group N included infants who were in neither group R nor group C and also did not have significant jaundice before 24 hours of age. Phototherapy codes from electronic databases were validated by chart review for a subset of 550 infants. RESULTS: Compared with chart review, phototherapy codes in the database were 94.4% sensitive (95% [CI]: 89.1%-97.5%) 2.3% received phototherapy. Phototherapy was administered to 54% of 1194 infants in group R (range across hospitals: 27%-77%), 16% of 2245 infants in group C (range: 5%-37%), and 0.2% of 44 362 infants in group N (range: 0.1%-0.6%). The predictors of phototherapy for group R, the group for whom phototherapy was recommended, determined by logistic regression were increasing TSB levels (odds ratio [OR]: 1.6/mg/dL; 95% CI: 1.4-1.7), reaching the AAP threshold at 24 to 47.9 hours of age compared with 48 hours or more (OR: 7.1; 95% CI: 4.3-11.9), gestational age of 37 weeks 38 weeks or more (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 0.6-0.8), and facility of birth (OR: 0.2-2.7). The facility of birth was a strong predictor of phototherapy use in all groups (R, C, and N). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians provided phototherapy to only 54% of term infants with hyperbilirubinemia for whom it was recommended by the AAP. There is marked interhospital variation in phototherapy use in this large managed care system. Improved adherence to the guideline would require only a slight increase in the total rate of phototherapy use if unnecessary use for infants with lower levels of TSB were simultaneously decreased.

A randomized controlled trial of provider selection OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of an intervention designed to help patients choose a new primary care provider (PCP) compared with the usual method of assigning patients to a new PCP. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial conducted between November 1998 and June 2000. INTERVENTION: Provision of telephone or web-based provider-specific information to aid in the selection of a provider. SETTING: Medical center within a large HMO. PATIENTS: One thousand and ninety patients who were >/=30 years old, whose previous PCP had retired and who responded to a mailed questionnaire 1 year after linkage with a new PCP. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The questionnaire assessed perceptions of choice, satisfaction, trust, and retention of the PCP. During the intervention period, 85% of subjects obtained a new PCP. Intervention subjects were more likely to perceive that they chose their PCP (78% vs 22%; P <.001), to retain their PCP at 1 year (93% vs 69%; P <.001), and to report greater overall satisfaction with the PCP (67% vs 57%; P <.01), compared to control subjects who were assigned to a PCP. The intervention subjects also reported greater trust in their PCP on most measures, but these differences did not remain statistically significant after adjustments for patient age, gender, ethnicity, education, and health status. CONCLUSIONS: Encouraging patients to choose their PCP can result in mutually beneficial outcomes for both patients and providers, such as greater overall satisfaction and duration of the relationship. Further research is needed to identify the types of information most useful in making this choice and to understand the relevant underlying patient expectations.

Management of cryptorchism and risk of testicular cancer Cryptorchism is an established risk factor for testicular cancer, but the role of age at surgical correction is unclear. The authors investigated this relation using information obtained from comprehensive medical records dating to childhood. They conducted a case-control study of 183 Kaiser Permanente members, who were diagnosed with testicular cancer during 1973-1996 and who were 15 years or younger when they first joined the health plan, and 551 controls. Notes pertaining to the testes were reviewed up to the case's diagnosis date or comparable date among the controls. The odds ratio for the association of a history of cryptorchism with testicular cancer risk was 4.8 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.9, 11.8). Compared with no history of cryptorchism, men with a history who had natural descent or successful orchiopexy by the 11th birthday were not at increased risk of testicular cancer (odds ratio = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.08, 5.4). However, successful treatment of cryptorchism only after the 11th birthday, or never, was related to a 32-fold increased risk (95% CI: 4, 250). Orchiopexy was performed before the 11th birthday on three men who developed testicular cancer but, in each, the procedure failed. In contrast, all four of the early orchiopexies performed on the controls were successful. Boys with failed orchiopexy should be considered for reoperative orchiopexy or G Am J Epidemiol. 2003 Apr 1;157(7):602-5. Ethnic and racial differences in diabetes care: The Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study OBJECTIVE: Diabetes and its complications disproportionately affect African Americans and Hispanics. Complications could be prevented with appropriate medical care. We compared five processes of care and three outcomes of care among African Americans, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (1993-1998) of participants with known diabetes. African Americans and Hispanics were compared with non-Hispanic whites from the same region. Five process measures (treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, albuminuria, and coronary artery disease) and three outcome measures (control of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia) were evaluated. RESULTS: Comparison groups were similar in baseline characteristics. African Americans and Hispanics were equally likely as their non-Hispanic white comparison group to receive treatment for diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, albuminuria, and coronary artery disease, although treatment rates for hyperlipidemia and albuminuria were poor for all groups. African Americans were more likely to have poorly controlled diabetes (HbA(1c) >8.0%: OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.26-3.94). Both African American and Hispanics were significantly more likely to have borderline or poorly controlled hypertension than non-Hispanic whites (blood pressure >130-140/85-90 or >140/90 mmHg: African 3.14, 1.35-7.3). CONCLUSIONS: The rates of treatment for diabetes and associated comorbidities are similar across all three ethnic groups. Few individuals in any ethnic group received treatment for hyperlipidemia and albuminuria. Ethnic disparities exist in control of diabetes and hypertension. Programs should be tested to improve overall quality of care and eliminate these disparities. Authors: Jr Diabetes Care. 2003 Apr;26(4):1040-6.

Training, quality assurance, and assessment of medical record abstraction in a multisite study Clinical studies using medical record review should include careful training and quality assurance methods to enhance the reliability and validity of data obtained from the records. Because of time and budget constraints, comprehensive assessments of data quality and reliability, including masking of medical record abstractors, are not always possible. This paper describes the abstractor training and quality control methods and results of a masked medical record review study. The medical record review study was carried out within a larger multisite study of the effectiveness of screening mammography in preventing breast cancer mortality with an observation period within 1983 and 1993, with mortality follow-up through 1998. An eight-step program was developed to train medical record abstractors and monitor the quality of their work. A key follow-up component to the training protocol was a 5% reabstraction of medical records (n = 160), masked and reviewed by a second abstractor. High agreement was found between initial (unmasked) abstractors and masked abstractors for all key exposure variables (kappa ranged from 0.76 to 0.91), with no evidence of biased directionality by unmasked reviewers. Rigorous ongoing training programs for medical record abstractors provide assurance of good quality control in large multisite studies. Additionally, a masking study with a subsample of subjects may be a feasible and cost-effective alternative to the time- and cost-intensive methodological approach SM; 2003 Mar 15;157(6):546-51.

Regarding: a cohort study of systemic and local complications implantation of intervention in obstetric clinics decreases adverse neonatal outcomes OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Early Start, a managed care organization's obstetric clinic-based perinatal substance abuse treatment program, on neonatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Study subjects were 6774 female Kaiser Permanente members who delivered babies between July 1, 1995 and June 30, 1998 and were screened by completing prenatal substance abuse screening questionnaires and urine toxicology screening tests. Four groups were compared: substance abusers screened, assessed, and treated by Early Start ('SAT,' n=782); substance abusers screened and assessed by Early Start who had no follow-up treatment ('SA,' n=348); substance abusers who were only screened n=262); and controls who screened negative ('C,' n=5382). RESULTS: Infants of SAT women had assisted ventilation rates (1.5%) similar to control infants (1.4%), but lower than the SA (4.0%, p=0.01) and S groups (3.1%, p=0.12). Similar patterns were found for low birth weight and preterm delivery. CONCLUSION: Improved neonatal outcomes were found among babies whose mothers received substance abuse treatment integrated with prenatal care. The babies of SAT women did as well as control infants on rates of assisted ventilation, low birth weight, and preterm delivery. They had lower rates of these three neonatal outcomes than infants of either SA or S women. Authors: Armstrong MA; Gonzales Perinatol. 2003 Jan;23(1):3-9. Primary health care teams. Opportunities and challenges in evaluation of service delivery innovations Quality of service and corporate productivity may be improved when employees are formed into semi-autonomous teams that are empowered to be innovative in service and are rewarded for attaining performance goals. This article describes the planned staffing and implementation strategies for three models of primary health care teams (HCTs) in a managed care organization (MCO). Implementation of each model focussed on (1) changes to primary care staffing mix (structural integration of roles) and (2) development of teamwork (functional integration of roles). Evidence from other industries suggests that the planned changes to structural and functional integration of existing primary care delivery models could improve system productivity, patient satisfaction, clinical quality, and employee morale. Retrospective evaluations of whether the planned improvements were achieved, and whether these achievements can be attributed to changes in staffing mix or teamwork, are now being conducted. Opportunities and limitations in conducting these retrospective evaluations are discussed, particularly with reference to use of existing data sources. The article concludes with recommendations for evaluation of natural experiments in primary care redesign. Authors: Roblin DW; Vogt TM; Fireman 2003 Jan-Mar;26(1):22-35; discussion 36-8. Jaundice noted in the first 24 hours after birth in a managed care organization OBJECTIVE: To investigate the significance of jaundice noted in the first 24 hours after birth in a community setting. DESIGN: Supplementary analyses of a nested case-control study. SETTING: Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program. PATIENTS: Six hundred thirty-one randomly selected newborns (controls) and 140 cases with total serum bilirubin levels of 25 mg/dL (428 micro mol/L) or higher from a cohort of 105 384 newborns of at least 2000 g birth weight and at least 36 weeks' gestational age, born between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Notations of jaundice in the medical record, timing and results of bilirubin testing, use of phototherapy, and development of bilirubin levels of 25 mg/dL or higher. RESULTS: Among the controls, the cumulative probability of a notation of jaundice (corrected for early hospital discharge using survival analysis) was 2.8% within 18 hours and 6.7% within 24 hours. In these newborns, cumulative proportions that had bilirubin levels measured were 38% within 12 hours and 43% within 24 hours of when jaundice was first noted. About 40% of bilirubin levels measured within 24 hours were above the estimated 95th percentile for age. Compared with newborns not noted to be jaundiced on the first day, newborns noted to be jaundiced within 24 hours were more likely to receive phototherapy (18.9% vs 1.7%; relative risk, 10.1; 95% confidence interval, 4.2-24.4) and to develop a bilirubin level of 25 mg/dL or higher (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-5.2), but the absolute risk increase for total serum bilirubin levels of 25 mg/dL or higher was 0.2%. CONCLUSION: Jaundice noted in the medical record in the first 24 hours after birth was uncommon and often clinically significant in this setting, but other factors also need to be considered in determining its importance.

Choice of a primary care physician and its relationship to adherence among patients with diabetes OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between selecting one's own primary care physician and adherence to treatment regimens as measured by patients' report of self-care behaviors and objective records of adherence to recommended prevention behaviors. STUDY DESIGN: A mail survey of physicians and their patients with diabetes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty physicians and 1200 of their patients with diabetes (30 per physician) from 3 health centers of Kaiser Permanente in Northern California were surveyed. The questionnaires asked about satisfaction, treatment adherence, and physician behavior. Data from the Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Registry of Northern California were used to assess whether patients had undergone recommended prevention tests and screenings. RESULTS: Patients who chose their primary care physicians reported significantly greater adherence to their treatment regimens (P < .01) than those assigned to a primary care physician, and this relationship remained significant after controlling for possible confounding factors (eg, physician gender, patient gender, length of relationship). Objective records of prevention behaviors indicated that patients who chose their physicians were significantly more likely to have had a retinal exam (P < .02) and tests for total cholesterol (P < .001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < .03), and glycosylated hemoglobin (P < .02) during the past 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the manner in which patients are linked with primary care physicians is associated with patient behavior; therefore, HMOs might increase opportunities for patients to choose their doctors, while determining those factors that affect patient choice and why choice makes a difference.

Is insulin sensitivity a causal intermediate in the relationship between alcohol consumption and carotid atherosclerosis?: the insulin resistance and atherosclerosis study OBJECTIVE: A J-shaped association has been demonstrated between alcohol consumption and atherosclerosis. Insulin resistance, also a risk factor for atherosclerosis, has been shown to have a similar J-shaped association with alcohol intake. This raises the question of whether insulin sensitivity (S(I)) is a causal intermediate in the alcohol-atherosclerosis relationship. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study was a multicenter cohort study designed to investigate relationships among S(I), risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and carotid artery atherosclerosis. Using regression analysis, we tested whether adjustment for S(I) attenuated the alcohol-atherosclerosis relationship observed at baseline. RESULTS: A J-shaped association was observed between alcohol consumption and common carotid artery intimal medial thickness. The protective aspect of the alcohol-atherosclerosis relationship was attenuated by 25% after the adjustment for S(I). However, an interaction was observed between alcohol consumption and glucose tolerance (GT) status. In comparison with never drinkers, all levels of alcohol consumption were associated with less atherosclerosis in participants with normal GT status. Participants with impaired GT status (but not diabetes) demonstrated a J-shaped alcohol-atherosclerosis association. All levels of alcohol consumption were associated with more atherosclerosis in participants with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: S(I) may be a causal intermediate at protective levels of alcohol intake, but an alcohol-GT interaction precluded a definitive conclusion. Moderate alcohol consumption may increase the risk of atherosclerosis in people with diabetes. These findings contrast with previous reports and do not support current recommendations regarding moderate alcohol consumption in people with diabetes. More research is needed to clarify this issue.

Understanding team-based quality improvement for depression in primary care OBJECTIVE: To assess the impacts of the characteristics of quality improvement (QI) teams and their environments on team success in designing and implementing high quality, enduring depression care improvement programs in primary care (PC) practices. STUDY SETTING/DATA SOURCES: Two nonprofit managed care organizations sponsored five QI teams tasked with improving care for depression in large PC practices. Data on characteristics of the teams and their environments is from observer process notes, national expert ratings, administrative data, and interviews. STUDY DESIGN: Comparative formative evaluation of the quality and duration of implementation of the depression improvement programs developed by Central Teams (CTs) emphasizing expert design and Local Teams (LTs) emphasizing participatory local clinician design, and of the effects of additional team and environmental factors on each type of team. Both types of teams depended upon local clinicians for implementation. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The CT intervention program designs were more evidence-based than those of LTs. Expert team leadership, support from local practice management, and support from local mental health specialists strongly influenced the development of successful team programs. The CTs and LTs were equally successful when these conditions could be met, but CTs were more successful than LTs in less supportive environments. CONCLUSIONS: The LT approach to QI for depression requires high local support and expertise from primary care and mental health clinicians. The CT approach is more likely to succeed than the LT approach when local practice conditions are not optimal. Authors: Res. 2002 Aug;37(4):1009-29. Factor analysis of metabolic syndrome using directly measured insulin sensitivity: The Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study Factor analysis, a multivariate correlation technique, has been used to provide insight into the underlying structure of metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by physiological complexity and strong statistical intercorrelation among its key variables. The majority of previous factor analyses, however, have used only surrogate measures of insulin sensitivity. In addition, few have included members of multiple ethnic groups, and only one has presented results separately for subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. The objective of this study was to investigate, using factor analysis, the clustering of physiologic variables using data from 1,087 nondiabetic participants in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS). This study includes information on the directly measured insulin sensitivity index (S(I)) from intravenous glucose tolerance testing among African-American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white subjects aged 40-69 years at various stages of glucose tolerance. Principal factor analysis identified two factors that explained 28 and 9% of the variance in the dataset, respectively. These factors were interpreted as 1) a ' metabolic' factor, with positive loadings of BMI, waist, fasting and 2-h glucose, and triglyceride and inverse loadings of log(S(I)+1) and HDL; and 2) a 'blood pressure' factor, with positive loadings of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The results were unchanged when surrogate measures of insulin resistance were used in place of log(S(I)+1). In addition, the results were similar within strata of sex, glucose tolerance status, and ethnicity. In conclusion, factor analysis identified two underlying factors among a group of metabolic syndrome variables in this dataset. Analyses using surrogate measures of insulin resistance suggested that these variables provide adequate information to explore the underlying intercorrelational structure of metabolic syndrome. Additional clarification of the physiologic characteristics of metabolic syndrome is required as individuals with this condition are increasingly being considered candidates for behavioral and resistance atherosclerosis study Diabetes. 2002 Aug;51(8):2642-7. Ethnic disparities in diabetic complications in an insured population CONTEXT: Higher rates of microvascular complications have been reported for minorities. Disparate access to quality health care is a common explanation for ethnic disparities in diabetic complication rates in the US population. Examining an ethnically diverse population with uniform health care coverage may be useful. OBJECTIVE: To assess ethnic disparities in the incidence of diabetic complications within a nonprofit prepaid health care organization. DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal observational study conducted January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1998, at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in northern California. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 62 432 diabetic patients, including Asians (12%), blacks (14%), Latinos (10%), and whites (64%). MAIN OUTCOME Incident infarction (MI), stroke, congestive heart failure (CHF), and nontraumatic lower extremity amputation (LEA), defined by primary hospitalization discharge diagnosis, procedures, or underlying cause of death; and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), defined as renal insufficiency requiring renal replacement therapy or transplantation for survival or by underlying cause of death. RESULTS: Patterns of ethnic differences were not consistent across complications and frequently persisted despite adjustment for a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and clinical factors. Adjusted hazard ratios (relative to that of whites) were 0.56, 0.68, and 0.68 for blacks, Asians, and Latinos, respectively (P<.001), for MI; 0.76 and 0.72 for Latinos, respectively (P<.01), for stroke; 0.70 and 0.61 for Asians Latinos, (P<.01), CHF; 0.40 for Asians (P<.001) for LEA; and 2.03, 1.85, and 1.46 for blacks, Asians, and Latinos, respectively (P<.01), for ESRD. There were no statistically significant black-white differences for stroke, CHF, or LEA and no Latino-white differences for LEA. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms previous reports of elevated incidence of ESRD among ethnic minorities, despite uniform medical care coverage, and provides new evidence that rates of other complications are similar or lower relative to those of whites. The persistence of ethnic disparities after adjustment suggests a possible genetic origin, the contribution of unmeasured environmental factors, or a combination of these 11 leading managed care organizations: progress and challenges CONTEXT: Although evidence-based national guidelines for tobacco-dependence treatment have been available since 1996, translating these guidelines into clinical practice is challenging. PRACTICE PATTERN EXAMINED: Policies regarding tobacco-dependence treatment (e.g., written guidelines and coverage of pharmacotherapy) and implementation strategies of 11 U.S. managed care organizations known to have strong tobacco-control programs. DATA SOURCES: Detailed telephone interviews with multiple informants at each health plan and review of written treatment guidelines and policies for tobacco dependence. RESULTS: Although 10 of 11 plans had adopted tobacco-dependence treatment guidelines consistent with the national guideline, fewer had guidelines for special groups, such as adolescents (6 plans), parents (5 plans), pregnant women (5 plans), and hospitalized smokers (3 plans). Most plans offered clinician training and recommended office systems to support provider efforts; however, fewer actively facilitated their implementation. Most plans provided other support for tobacco treatment, including dedicated budgets, designated staff, and an oversight committee. All plans offered some coverage for tobacco-cessation pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling, although not to the extent recommended by the national guideline. CONCLUSION: Implementation of national tobacco-treatment guidelines is feasible in closed-panel managed care organizations. However, even these leading health plans could do more to comply with national practice guidelines on tobacco-dependence treatment and make it easier for clinicians to help patients stop smoking (e.g., through increased training and expanded coverage of tobacco-dependence treatment).

Race, epithelial ovarian cancer survival, and membership in a large health maintenance organization BACKGROUND: African-American ovarian cancer patients present with more advanced disease and have poorer survival than do white patients. METHODS: To determine whether these differences occur among African-American and white patients who have equal access to medical care, we analyzed ovarian cancer patient characteristics separately for 1,587 members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Plan of Northern California and 5,757 non-members. RESULTS: The distributions of disease stage at diagnosis were similar among African-American and white patients, both in the Kaiser plan and elsewhere. However, ovarian cancer death rates, adjusted for disease stage and age at diagnosis and for histology, were higher for African-American patients compared with white patients, regardless of Kaiser membership status. The death rate ratios for African-Americans compared with whites were 1.32 (95% CI = 1.02-1.70) for Kaiser members and 1.20 (95% CI = 1.04-1.40) for Kaiser non-members. CONCLUSION: Further research within an equal-access care system is needed to evaluate other important factors such as specialty of surgeon, extent of residual tumor after surgery, chemotherapy treatment, and postoperative management to determine whether these factors are contributing to the differences in survival between African-American and white ovarian cancer patients. Authors: McGuire V; a nested case-control study OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of neonatal dehydration leading to rehospitalization, whether clinical and health services data could predict its occurrence, and the outcome of dehydrated infants. METHODS: We employed a retrospective case-control design nested within a cohort of 51 383 newborns weighing 2000 g or more, with a gestational age of 36 weeks or more born at 11 Kaiser Permanente hospitals during 1995 and 1996. Cases were 110 infants who were rehospitalized within 15 days of discharge with dehydration, and who either had 12% or greater weight loss or a serum sodium level of 150 mEq/L or greater. Controls were 402 randomly selected infants. We reviewed subjects' paper medical records and telephoned their families at 24 to 36 months of age to ascertain neurological outcomes. RESULTS: Rehospitalization for dehydration occurred in 2.1 per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-2.6). Among vaginal births, the most important risk factors were being born of a first-time mother (adjusted odds ratio 3.9-32.6); maternal age to older than 35 years (AOR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.5-6.0); and gestational age younger than 39 weeks (AOR, 2.0, 95% CI, 1.2-3.5). Among cesarean births, having a birth hospitalization length of stay less than 48 hours was associated with dehydration (odds ratio [OR], 14.8; 95% CI, 1.4-154.1). Adherence to the American Academy of Pediatrics follow-up guideline did not decrease risk of readmission. Among surviving infants, 1 of 110 cases and 12 of 400 controls had evidence of possible neurological problems 24 to 36 months after discharge (P =.3). No cases of limb gangrene, amputation, or intracranial infarction occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In this population with good access to medical care, serious sequelae of neonatal dehydration are rare. Interventions to decrease the frequency of neonatal dehydration should focus on first-time mothers and those who breastfeed exclusively. Authors: Adolesc Med. 2002 Feb;156(2):155-61.

Risk factors for synchronous primary endometrial and ovarian cancers PURPOSE: The incidence of synchronous primary endometrial and ovarian cancer is 2- to 10-fold higher than that expected based on the incidence of each cancer alone. We sought to evaluate reasons for this in a case-control study. METHODS: We combined data on a maternal history of cancer and reproductive and menstrual factors from 56 women with synchronous multiple primary disease who had participated in three population-based studies of gynecologic cancer. For comparison, we analyzed the same information from 280 women with endometrial cancer alone, 280 with ovarian cancer alone, and 280 without a history of either cancer. RESULTS: The reduced risk of multiple primary disease associated with high parity (2 or more births vs 0: OR = 0.37, 95% Cl, 0.19-76) and long-term use of oral contraceptives (12 or more months vs none: OR = 0.60, 95% Cl, 0.24-1.5) tended to be more pronounced than that associated with endometrial cancer alone or with ovarian cancer alone. CONCLUSIONS: Though limited by relatively small numbers, our results suggest that the presence of some common etiologies is a basis for the unusually high co-occurrence of endometrial and 2001 Nov;11(8):529-33. Relation of childhood height and later risk of breast cancer The authors sought to examine the hypothesis that girls who were relatively tall during the prepubescent period (indicative of an affluent diet and good general health) were at increased risk of subsequent breast cancer. They conducted a case-control study of 214 long-term members who were diagnosed with breast cancer during 1973-1995 and who were age 12 years or younger when they first joined Kaiser Permanente and of 214 appropriately matched controls. Information was obtained from the medical records. While the authors observed the expected association of adult height with risk of breast cancer (height at age 15-18 years, tall-for-age vs. short-for-age: odds ratio = 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 4.3), the association was no stronger earlier in life (height at age 9-11 years: odds ratio = 1.0, 95% confidence interval: 0.5, 1.8). The study does not support a relation between pubertal skeletal growth and adult risk of breast cancer. However, it is limited by the inclusion of few postmenopausal women.

A randomized comparison of home visits and hospital-based group follow-up visits after early postpartum discharge OBJECTIVE: Short postpartum stays are common. Current guidelines provide scant guidance on how routine follow-up of newly discharged mother-infant pairs should be performed. We aimed to compare 2 short-term (within 72 hours of discharge) follow-up strategies for low-risk mother-infant pairs with postpartum length of stay (LOS) of <48 hours: home visits by a nurse and hospital-based follow-up anchored in group visits. METHODS: We used a randomized clinical trial design with intention-to-treat analysis in an integrated managed care setting that serves a largely middle class population. Mother-infant pairs that met LOS and risk criteria were randomized to the control arm (hospital-based follow-up) or to the intervention arm (home nurse visit). Clinical utilization and costs were studied using computerized databases and chart review. Breastfeeding continuation, maternal depressive symptoms, and maternal satisfaction were assessed by means of telephone interviews at 2 weeks postpartum. RESULTS: During a 17-month period in 1998 to 1999, we enrolled and randomized 1014 mother-infant pairs (506 to the control group and 508 to the intervention group). There were no significant differences between the study groups with respect to maternal age, race, education, household income, parity, previous breastfeeding experience, early initiation of prenatal care, or postpartum LOS. There were no differences with respect to neonatal LOS or Apgar scores. In the control group, 264 mother-infant pairs had an individual visit only, 157 had a group visit only, 64 had both a group and an individual visit, 4 had a home health and a hospital-based follow-up, 13 had no follow-up within 72 hours, and 4 were lost to follow-up. With respect to outcomes within 2 weeks after discharge, there were no significant differences in newborn or maternal hospitalizations or urgent care visits, breastfeeding discontinuation, maternal depressive symptoms, or a combined clinical outcome measure indicating whether a mother-infant pair had any of the above outcomes. However, mothers in the home visit group were more likely than those in the control group to rate multiple aspects of their care as excellent or very good. These included the preventive advice delivered (76% vs 59%) and the skills and abilities of the provider (84% vs 73%). Mothers in the home visit group also gave higher ratings on overall satisfaction with the newborn's posthospital care (71% vs 59%), as well as with their own posthospital care (63% vs 55%). The estimated cost of a postpartum home visit to the mother and the newborn was $265. In contrast, the cost of the hospital-based group visit was $22 per mother-infant pair; the cost of an individual 15-minute visit with a registered nurse was $52; the cost of a 15-minute individual pediatrician visit was $92; and the cost of a 10-minute visit with an obstetrician was $92. CONCLUSIONS: For low-risk mothers and newborns in an integrated managed care organization, home visits compared with hospital-based follow-up and group visits were more costly but achieved comparable clinical outcomes and were associated with higher maternal satisfaction. Neither strategy is associated with significantly greater success at increasing continuation of breastfeeding. This study had limited power to identify group differences in rehospitalization and may not be generalizable to higher-risk populations without comparable access to integrated hospital and outpatient TA Pediatrics. 2001 Sep;108(3):719-27. Developing a prediction rule from automated clinical databases to identify high-risk patients in a large population with diabetes OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a prediction rule for identifying diabetic patients at high short-term risk of complications using automated data in a large managed care organization. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort analyses were performed in 57,722 diabetic members of Kaiser Permanente, Northern California, aged > or =19 years. Data from 1994 to 1995 were used to model risk for macro- and microvascular complications (n = 3,977), infectious complications (n = 1,580), and metabolic complications (n = 316) during 1996. Candidate predictors (n = 36) included prior inpatient and outpatient diagnoses, laboratory records, pharmacy records, utilization records, and survey data. Using split-sample validation, the risk scores derived from logistic regression models in half of the population were evaluated in the second half. Sensitivity, positive predictive value, and receiver operating characteristics curves were used to compare scores obtained from full models to those derived using simpler approaches. RESULTS: History of prior complications or related outpatient diagnoses were the strongest predictors in each complications set. For patients without previous events, treatment with insulin alone, serum creatinine > or =1.3 mg/dl, use of two or antihypertensive medications, HbA(1c) >10%, and albuminuria/microalbuminuria were independent predictors of two or all three complications. Several risk scores derived from multivariate models were more efficient than simply targeting patients with elevated HbA(1c) levels for identifying high-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: Simple prediction rules based on automated clinical data are useful in planning care management for populations with Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels and glycemic control: the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Diabetes registry PURPOSE: We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of self-monitoring blood glucose levels to improve glycemic control. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cohort design was used to assess the relation between self-monitoring frequency (1996 average daily glucometer strip utilization) and the first glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level measured in 1997. The study sample included 24,312 adult patients with diabetes who were members of a large, group model, managed care organization. We estimated the difference between HbA1c levels in patients who self-monitored at frequencies recommended by the American Diabetes Association compared with those who monitored less frequently or not at all. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, occupation, income, duration of diabetes, medication refill adherence, clinic appointment 'no show' rate, annual eye exam attendance, use of nonpharmacological (diet and exercise) diabetes therapy, smoking, alcohol consumption, hospitalization and emergency room visits, and the number of daily insulin injections. RESULTS: Self-monitoring among patients with type 1 diabetes (> or = 3 times daily) and pharmacologically treated type 2 diabetes (at least daily) was associated with lower HbA1c levels (1.0 percentage points lower in type 1 diabetes and 0.6 points lower in type 2 diabetes) than was less frequent monitoring (P < 0.0001). Although there are no specific recommendations for patients with nonpharmacologically treated type 2 diabetes, those who practiced self-monitoring (at any frequency) had a 0.4 point lower HbA1c level than those not practicing at all (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: More frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose levels was associated with clinically and statistically better glycemic control regardless of diabetes type or therapy. These findings support the clinical recommendations suggested by the American Diabetes Association. J Med. 2001 Jul;111(1):1-9. Hormone replacement therapy is associated with better glycemic control in women with type 2 diabetes: The Northern California Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Registry OBJECTIVE: In women with diabetes, the changes that accompany menopause may further diminish glycemic control. Little is known about how hormone replacement therapy (HRT) affects glucose metabolism in diabetes. The aim of this study was to examine whether HbA(1c) levels varied by current HRT among women with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cohort of 15,435 women with type 2 diabetes who were members of a health maintenance organization, HbA(1c) and HRT were assessed by reviewing records in the health plan's computerized laboratory and pharmacy systems. Sociodemographic and clinical information were collected by survey. RESULTS: The mean age was 64.7 years (SD +/- 8.7). The study cohort comprised 55% non-Hispanic whites, 14% non-Hispanic blacks, 12% Hispanics, 11% Asians, 4% 'other' ethnic groups, and 4% with missing ethnicity data. Current HRT was observed in 25% of women. HbA(1c) levels were significantly lower in women currently using HRT than in women not using HRT (age-adjusted mean +/- SE: 7.9 +/- 0.03 vs. 8.5 +/- 0.02, respectively, P = 0.0001). No differences in HbA(1c) level were observed between women using unopposed estrogens and women using opposed estrogens. In a Generalized Estimating Equation model, which took into account patient clustering within physician and adjusted for age, ethnicity, education, obesity, hypoglycemic therapy, diabetes duration, self-monitoring of blood glucose, and exercise, HRT remained significantly and independently associated with decreased HbA(1c) levels (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: HRT was independently associated with decreased HbA(1c) level. Clinical trials will be necessary to understand whether HRT may improve glycemic control in Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Registry Diabetes Care. 2001 Jul;24(7):1144-50. Patterns of cigarette smoking and alcohol use among lesbians and bisexual women enrolled in a large health maintenance organization OBJECTIVES: This study compared the prevalence of cigarette smoking and alcohol use among lesbians and bisexual women with that among heterosexual women. METHODS: Logistic regression models were created with data from an extensive member health survey at a large health maintenance organization. Sexual orientation was the primary predictor, and alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking were outcomes. RESULTS: Lesbians and bisexual women younger than 50 years were more likely than heterosexual women to smoke cigarettes and drink heavily. Lesbians and bisexual women aged 20 to 34 reported higher weekly alcohol consumption and less abstinence compared with heterosexual women and older lesbians and bisexual women. CONCLUSIONS: Lesbians and bisexual women aged 20 to 34 years are at risk for alcohol use and cigarette smoking.

Insulin secretion, obesity, and potential behavioral influences: results from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) BACKGROUND: This work was conducted to evaluate associations of insulin secretion with overall and central obesity, dietary fats, physical activity, and alcohol. METHODS: A frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) was used to assess acute insulin response to glucose (AIR) and insulin sensitivity (S(I)) among adult participants (n=675 with normal, NGT; n=332 with impaired glucose tolerance, IGT) in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS). Disposition index (DI) was calculated as the sum of the log-transformed AIR and S(I) to reflect pancreatic compensation for insulin resistance. Obesity was measured as body mass index (kg/m(2), BMI) and central fat distribution by waist circumference (cm). Dietary fat intake (total, saturated, polyunsaturated, oleic acid), physical activity, and alcohol intake were assessed by standardized interview. RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, BMI and waist were each positively correlated with AIR among NGTs (r=0.26 and 0.23, respectively; p<0.05 for BMI and waist, respectively). waist were inversely correlated with DI among -0.19, respectively, p<0.0001). Dietary fat variables were positively related, and alcohol was inversely related, to AIR among NGTs (p<0.01) but not among IGTs. With all factors considered simultaneously in a pooled analysis of IGTs and NGTs, waist, but not BMI, was positively associated with AIR (p<0.001) and inversely associated with DI (p<0.01). None of the behavioral variables were independently related to either outcome. CONCLUSION: Among non-diabetic patients, central obesity appears to be related to higher insulin secretion, but to lower capacity of the pancreas to respond to the ambient insulin resistance.

Strategies for reduction Neonatal intensive care is extremely expensive; there is both a financial and an ethical obligation to practice efficiently. In the current era of intense cost containment in hospital care, neonatologists and hospital administrators are under pressure to find strategies for cost reduction for neonatal services. In this review, we address reducing discretionary admissions, the high costs of low-cost testing, minimizing use of selected high-cost technologies (ventilators and parenteral nutrition), shortening length of stay, and optimizing nursing allocation. 2001 Mar;21(2):121-7. Examining the impact of missing data on propensity score estimation in determining the effectiveness of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) In many health services applications, research to determine the effectiveness of a particular treatment cannot be carried out using a controlled clinical trial. In settings such as these, observational studies must be used. Propensity score methods are useful tools to employ in order to balance the distribution of covariates between treatment groups and hence reduce the potential bias in treatment effect estimates in observational studies. A challenge in many health services research studies is the presence of missing data among the covariates that need to be balanced. In this paper, we compare three simple propensity models using data that examine the effectiveness of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in reducing hemoglobin A1c in a cohort of 10,566 type 2 diabetics. The first propensity score model uses only subjects with complete case data (n=6,687), the second incorporates missing value indicators into the model, and the third fits separate propensity scores for each pattern of missing data. We compare the results of these methods and find that incorporating missing data into the propensity score model reduces the estimated effect of SMBG on hemoglobin A1c by more than 10%, although this reduction was not clinically significant. In addition, beginning with the complete data, we artificially introduce missing data using a nonignorable missing data mechanism and compare treatment effect estimates using the three propensity score methods and a simple analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) method. In these analyses, we find that the complete case analysis and the ANCOVA method both perform poorly, the missing value indicator model performs moderately well, and the pattern mixture model performs even better in estimating the original treatment effect observed in the complete data prior to the introduction of artificial missing data. We conclude that in observational studies one must not only adjust for potentially confounding variables using methods such as propensity scores, but one should also account for missing data in these models in order to allow for causal inference more appropriately to be applied.

SNAP-II and SNAPPE-II: Simplified newborn illness severity and mortality risk scores OBJECTIVES: Illness severity scores for newborns are complex and restricted by birth weight and have dated validations and calibrations. We developed and validated simplified neonatal illness severity and mortality risk scores. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty neonatal intensive care units in Canada, California, and New England collected data on all admissions during the mid 1990s; patients moribund at birth or discharged to normal newborn care in <24 hours were excluded. Starting with the 34 data elements of the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP), we derived the most parsimonious logistic model for in-hospital mortality using 10,819 randomly selected Canadian cases. SNAP-II includes 6 physiologic items; to this are added points for birth weight, low Apgar score, and small for gestational age to create a 9-item SNAP-Perinatal Extension-II (SNAPPE-II). We validated SNAPPE-II on the remaining 14,610 cases and optimized the calibration. RESULTS: In all birth weights, SNAPPE-II had excellent discrimination and goodness of fit. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was .91 +/- 0.01. Goodness of fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow) was 0.90. CONCLUSIONS: SNAP-II and SNAPPE-II are empirically validated illness severity and mortality risk scores for newborn intensive care. They are simple, accurate, and robust across populations. Authors: Richardson DK; Corcoran JD; Escobar GJ; Lee Early Start: an obstetric clinic-based, perinatal substance abuse intervention program Maternal substance abuse is a serious problem with significant adverse effects to mothers, fetuses, and children. The Early Start Program provides pregnant women in a managed care organization with screening and early identification of substance abuse problems, early intervention, ongoing counseling, and case management by a licensed clinical social worker located in the prenatal clinic, where she is an integral part of the prenatal team. We describe the development of the Early Start Program, its administrative history, and how it has interfaced with clinicians and administrators. We also highlight two important program characteristics: the partnership with a perinatal health services research unit and the degree to which the program could be 'exported' to other managed care settings.

OBJECTIVE: To assess frequency of and identify risk factors for the development of cervical stenosis after loop electrosurgical excision procedure. METHODS: We reviewed outpatient charts of women treated by loop excision for cervical dysplasia between August 1996 and January 1998 in the colposcopy clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital. One hundred sixty-four women were evaluated for cervical stenosis during follow-up. Stenosis was considered present if manual dilation was required to allow endocervical sampling with an endocervical currette 3 mm wide. Multivariable analysis with stepwise logistic regression was used to evaluate age, parity, tobacco use, hormonal status, use of oral contraceptives, pathology, previous loop excision, performance of additional endocervical excision, and dimensions of excision specimens as predictors of cervical stenosis. RESULTS: The average age was 32 years. Cervical stenosis occurred in ten of 164 women (6%, 95% CI 3%, 11%). Among factors analyzed, previous loop excision and volume of excision specimen were the only independent predictors of stenosis. CONCLUSION: Cervical stenosis correlated with history of loop excision and volume of tissue removed, suggesting that women who have second excisions or large excisions should be counseled that their risk of stenosis might Prediction and prevention of extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in a mature health maintenance organization OBJECTIVE: To investigate biological and health services predictors of extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in a health maintenance organization. DESIGN: Nested case-control study. SETTING: Eleven Northern California Kaiser Permanente hospitals. SUBJECTS: The cohort consisted of 51,387 newborns born at 36 weeks or later weighing 2000 g or more. Cases were newborns with peak total serum bilirubin levels greater than or equal to 428 micromol/L (> or =25 mg/dL) (n = 73). Controls were a random sample of newborns from the cohort with peak bilirubin levels less than 428 micromol/L (<25 mg/dL) (n = 423). MEASUREMENTS: Review of medical records and telephone interviews. RESULTS: Early jaundice was most strongly associated with case status (odds ratio [OR] = 7.3). After excluding subjects with early jaundice, the strongest predictors of hyperbilirubinemia were family history of jaundice in a newborn (OR = 6.0), exclusive breastfeeding (OR = 5.7), bruising (OR = 4.0), Asian race (OR = 3.5), cephalhematoma (OR = 3.3), maternal age of 25 years or older (OR = 3.1), and lower gestational age (OR = 0.6/week). These variables identified 61% of newborns as very low risk (about 1/4200). However, the risk in the remaining 39% was still low (1/370). More cases (79%) than controls (59%) had newborn length-of-stay and follow-up consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, but phototherapy use within 8 hours of the time that the guidelines recommend was uncommon in both cases (26%) and controls (33%). There were no apparent cases of kernicterus. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of extreme hyperbilirubinemia may require closer follow-up than is currently recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and more use of phototherapy than was observed in this study. To prevent extreme hyperbilirubinemia (> or =428 micromol/L [> or =25 mg/dL]) in 1 newborn, many newborns would need to receive these interventions.

Effect of physician and patient gender concordance on patient satisfaction and preventive care practices OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of the gender of the patient and the gender of the physician in explaining differences in patient satisfaction and patient-reported primary care practice. DESIGN: Crosssectional mailed survey [response rate of 71%]. SETTING: A large group-model Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) in northern California. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of HMO members aged 35 to 85 years with a primary care physician. The respondents (N = 10,205) were divided into four dyads: female patients of female doctors; male patients of female doctors; female patients of male doctors; and male patients of male doctors. Patients were also stratified on the basis of whether they had chosen their physician or had been assigned. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among patients who chose their physician, females who chose female doctors were the least satisfied of the four groups of patients for four of five measures of satisfaction. Male patients of female physicians were the most satisfied. Preventive care and health promotion practices were comparable for male and female physicians. Female patients were more likely to have chosen their physician than males, and were much more likely to have chosen female physicians. These differences were not seen among patients who had been assigned to their physicians and were not due to differences in any of the measured aspects of health values or beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed differences in patient satisfaction related to the gender of the patient and of the physician. While our study cannot determine the reasons for these differences, the results suggest that patients who choose their physician may have different expectations, and the difficulty of fulfi11ing these expectations may present particular challenges for Neonatal sepsis workups in infants >/=2000 grams at birth: A population-based study BACKGROUND: Few data are available on the outcome of neonatal sepsis evaluations in an era when intrapartum antibiotic therapy is common. METHODS: We identified all newborns weighing >/=2000 g at birth who were ever evaluated for suspected bacterial infection at 6 Kaiser Permanente hospitals between October 1995 and November 1996, reviewed their records and laboratory data, and tracked them to 1 week after discharge. We analyzed the relationship between key predictors and the presence of neonatal bacterial infection. RESULTS: Among 18 299 newborns >/=2000 g without major congenital anomalies, 2785 (15.2%) were evaluated for sepsis with a complete blood count and/or blood culture. A total of 62 (2.2%) met criteria for proven, probable, or possible bacterial infection: 22 (.8%) had positive cultures and 40 (1.4%) had clinical evidence of bacterial infection. We tracked all but 10 infants (.4%) to 7 days postdischarge. There were 67 rehospitalizations (2.4%; 2 for group B streptococcus bacteremia). Among 1568 infants who did not receive intrapartum antibiotics, initial asymptomatic status was associated with decreased risk of infection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]:.26; 95% confidence associated with increased risk. Results were similar among 1217 infants who were treated, except that maternal chorioamnionitis was not significantly associated with neonatal infection. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of bacterial infection in asymptomatic newborns is low. Evidence-based observation and treatment protocols could be defined based on a limited set of predictors: maternal fever, chorioamnionitis, initial neonatal examination, and absolute neutrophil count. Many missed opportunities for treating mothers and infants exist. Authors: Escobar GJ; Li DK; Bergen R Pediatrics. 2000 Aug;106(2 Pt 1):256-63. How accurately does the medical record capture maternal history of cancer? We sought to assess the reliability of information regarding the maternal history of cancer by comparing the medical records of 214 women with breast cancer, ages 26-59 years and diagnosed in 1974-1995, and of their controls with the medical records of their mothers. Subjects were members of Kaiser Permanente, Northern California, selected for a study of early-life predictors of breast cancer. For any type of cancer identified in the mother's medical record, the proportion noted in the daughter's medical record at least 6 months before the daughter's diagnosis or reference date was 56% among cases and 32% among controls. The odds ratio for the association of maternal cancer history with breast cancer risk was 2.1 using the maternal record and 3.5 using the subject's record. For a maternal history of breast cancer, the proportion noted in the subject's record was 79% among cases and 57% among controls, and the odds ratios were 4.0 and 6.5, respectively. We believe that the case-control difference in missing information was attributable to higher utilization of breast cancer screening among cases. This study illustrates the need to assess the impact of screening differences on the ascertainment of information from the medical Comparing the medical expenses of children with Medicaid and commercial insurance in an HMO BACKGROUND: In recent years, growing numbers of children with Medicaid have been enrolled in managed care plans nationwide. Yet, large, commercial managed care plans are increasingly discontinuing their participation in Medicaid because of low Medicaid payment rates. OBJECTIVE: To compare the healthcare utilization and costs of children with Medicaid and children with commercial insurance within the same health maintenance organization (HMO). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study using electronically captured cost and utilization data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the healthcare utilization and costs of children with Medicaid (n = 42,636) and children with commercial insurance (n = 159,651) who were members of the same large, nonprofit HMO at any time between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997. Medicaid children were grouped as income eligible, medically needy, and blind or disabled. RESULTS: The unadjusted costs of income-eligible, Medicaid-insured children were not significantly different from those of commercially insured children. The medically needy were $25 per month more expensive than commercially insured children (P = 0.02), and the blind or disabled were $213 per month more expensive (P < .01). After adjusting for age and sex, income-eligible children were $5 per month more expensive than children with commercial insurance (P = .07), the medically needy were $20 per month more expensive (P = .02), and the blind or disabled were $216 per month more expensive (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The costs of income-eligible, Medicaid-insured children in this HMO were similar to those of commercially insured children, but the costs for the medically needy and the blind and disabled were substantially higher.

A randomized comparison of home and clinic follow-up visits after early postpartum hospital discharge BACKGROUND: Recently enacted federal legislation mandates insurance coverage of at least 48 hours of postpartum hospitalization, but most mothers and newborns in the United States will continue to go home before the third postpartum day. National guidelines recommend a follow-up visit on the third or fourth postpartum day, but scant evidence exists about whether home or clinic visits are more effective. METHODS: We enrolled 1163 medically and socially low-risk mother-newborn pairs with uncomplicated delivery and randomly assigned them to receive home visits by nurses or pediatric clinic visits by nurse practitioners or physicians on the third or fourth postpartum day. In contrast with the 20-minute pediatric clinic visits, the home visits were longer (median: 70 minutes), included preventive counseling about the home environment, and included a physical examination of the mother. Clinical utilization and costs were studied using computerized databases. Breastfeeding continuation, maternal depressive symptoms, and maternal satisfaction were assessed by means of telephone interviews at 2 weeks' postpartum. RESULTS: Comparing the 580 pairs in the home visit group and the 583 pairs in the pediatric clinic visit group, no significant differences occurred in clinical outcomes as measured by maternal or newborn rehospitalization within 10 days postpartum, maternal or newborn urgent clinic visits within 10 days postpartum, or breastfeeding discontinuation or maternal depressive symptoms at the 2-week interview. The same was true for a combined clinical outcome measure indicating whether a mother-newborn pair had any of the above outcomes. In contrast, higher proportions of mothers in the home visit group rated as excellent or very good the preventive advice delivered (80% vs 44%), the provider's skills and abilities the posthospital (87% their own posthospital care (75% vs 47%). On average, a home visit cost $255 and a pediatric clinic visit cost $120. CONCLUSIONS: For low-risk mothers and newborns in this integrated health maintenance organization, home visits compared with pediatric clinic visits on the third or fourth postpartum hospital day were more costly, but were associated with equivalent clinical outcomes and markedly higher maternal satisfaction. This study had limited power to identify group differences in rehospitalization, and may not be generalizable to higher-risk populations without comparable access to integrated hospital and outpatient care.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose: language and financial barriers in a managed care population with diabetes OBJECTIVE: Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a cornerstone of diabetes care, but little is known about barriers to this self-care practice. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study examines SMBG practice patterns and barriers in 44,181 adults with pharmacologically treated diabetes from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Region who responded to a health survey (83% response rate). The primary outcome is self-reported frequency of SMBG. RESULTS: Although most patients reported some level of SMBG monitoring, 60% of those with type 1 diabetes and 67% of those with type 2 diabetes reported practicing SMBG less frequently than recommended by the American Diabetes Association (three to four times daily for type 1 diabetes, and once daily for type 2 diabetes treated pharmacologically). Significant independent predictors of nonadherent practice of SMBG included longer time since diagnosis, less intensive therapy, male sex, age, belonging to an ethnic minority, having a lower education and neighborhood income, difficulty communicating in English, higher out-of-pocket costs for glucometer strips (especially for subjects with lower incomes), smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable gaps persist between actual and recommended SMBG practices in this large managed care organization. A somewhat reduced SMBG frequency in subjects with linguistic barriers, some ethnic minorities, and subjects with lower education levels suggests the potential for targeted, culturally sensitive, multilingual health education. The somewhat lower frequency of SMBG among subjects paying higher out-of-pocket expenditures for strips suggests that removal of financial barriers by providing more comprehensive coverage for these costs may enhance adherence to recommendations ventilation: predictors, frequency, and duration in a mature managed care organization OBJECTIVES: Reference data are lacking on the frequency and duration of assisted ventilation in neonates. This information is essential for determining resource needs and planning clinical trials. As mortality becomes uncommon, ventilator utilization is increasingly used as a measure for assessing therapeutic effect and quality of care in intensive care medicine. Valid comparisons require adjustments for differences in a patient's baseline risk for assisted ventilation and prolonged ventilator support. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency and length of ventilation (LOV) in preterm and term infants and to develop models for predicting the need for assisted ventilation and length of ventilator support. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, population-based cohort study of 77 576 inborn live births at 6 Northern California hospitals with level 3 intensive care nurseries in a group-model managed care organization. The gestational age-specific frequency and duration of assisted ventilation among surviving infants was determined. Multivariable regression was performed to determine predictors for assisted ventilation and LOV. RESULTS: Of 77 576 inborn live births in the study, 11 199 required admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and of these, 1928 survivors required ventilator support. The proportion of infants requiring assisted ventilation and the median LOV decreased markedly with increasing gestational age. In addition to gestational age, admission illness severity, 5-minute Apgar scores, presence of anomalies, male sex, and white race were important predictors for the need for assisted ventilation. The ability of the models to predict need for ventilation was high, and significantly better than birth weight alone with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of.90 versus.70 for preterm infants, and.88 versus.50 for term infants. For preterm infants, gestational age, admission illness severity, oxygenation index, anomalies, and small-for-gestational age status were significant predictors for LOV, accounting for 60% of the variance in the length of assisted ventilation. For term infants, oxygenation index and anomalies were significant predictors but only accounted for 29% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable variation exists in the utilization of ventilator support among infants of closely related gestational age. In addition, a number of medical risk factors influence the need for, and length of, assisted ventilation. These models explain much of the variance in LOV among preterm infants but explain substantially less among term infants.neonatal intensive care, assisted ventilation, Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology, resource consumption, prematurity.

Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults OBJECTIVE: Health care financing is changing rapidly in the United States. We investigated whether and how health care access is changing concurrently with changes in financing, with special attention to a minority population. METHODS: We examined a longitudinal biracial (half African-American, half White) urban cohort of 3,565 individuals, aged 25-37 years old, in 1992-93 and again in 1995-96. We measured access by self-reported (1) health insurance status, (2) regular source of medical care, and (3) lack of care due to financial problems. RESULTS: In 1992-93, 30.3% of the cohort experienced at least one access barrier, with a decline to 26.8% in 1995-96 (P<.005). However, access improved more for Whites than for African Americans; and access improved for higher, but not for lower, income groups (7% improvement for high income, vs 2% deterioration for lower income, P<.01). In addition, there was an 11% to 19% absolute increase in individuals making co-payments for health care utilization across all race/sex groups, with African Americans having markedly higher proportions of cost-sharing. African-American, low income, and unemployed individuals reported more acute care, but fewer outpatient visits. Income and employment explained racial differences. CONCLUSION: While access has improved or stabilized for higher income groups, there is a widening gap according to income, accompanied by an acute care pattern for low income groups that may be both inadequate and cost inefficient. Authors: Frequency of neonatal bilirubin testing and hyperbilirubinemia in a large health maintenance organization OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and interhospital variation of bilirubin testing and identified hyperbilirubinemia in a large health maintenance organization. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Eleven Northern California Kaiser Permanente hospitals. SUBJECTS: A total of 51,387 infants born in 1995-1996 at >/= 36 weeks' gestation and >/= 2000 g. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Bilirubin tests and maximum bilirubin levels recorded in the first month after birth. RESULTS: The proportion of infants receiving >/= 1 bilirubin test varied across hospitals from 17% to 52%. The frequency of bilirubin levels >/= varied from .9% to 3.4% (mean: 2.0%), but was not associated with the frequency of bilirubin testing (R(2) = .02). Maximum bilirubin levels >/= 25 mg/dL (428 micromol/L) were identified in.15% of infants levels 30 mg/dL (513 micromol/L) in .01%. CONCLUSIONS: Significant interhospital differences exist in bilirubin and frequency of identified hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin levels >/=20 mg/dL were commonly identified, but levels 25 mg/dL were not. Authors: Newman syncytial virus prophylaxis among preterm infants OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the costs and benefits of two new agents, respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin (RSVIG) and palivizumab, to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection among premature infants discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) before the start of the RSV season. Method. Decision analysis was used to compare the projected societal cost-effectiveness of three strategies-RSVIG, palivizumab, and no prophylaxis-among a hypothetical cohort of premature infants. Probabilities and costs of hospitalization were derived from a cohort of 1721 premature infants discharged from six Kaiser Permanente-Northern California NICUs. Efficacies of prophylaxis were based on published trials. Costs of prophylaxis were derived from published sources. Mortality among infants hospitalized for RSV was assumed to be 1.2%. Future benefits were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: Palivizumab was both more effective and less costly than RSVIG. Cost-effectiveness varied widely by subgroup. Palivizumab appeared most cost-effective for infants whose gestational age was =32 weeks, who required >/=28 days of oxygen in the NICU, and who were discharged from the NICU from September through November. In this subgroup, palivizumab was predicted to cost $12,000 per hospitalization averted (after taking into account savings from prevention of RSV admissions) or $33,000 per life-year saved, and the number needed to treat to avoid one hospitalization was estimated at 7.4. However, for all other subgroups, ratios ranged from $39,000 to $420,000 per hospitalization averted or $110,000 to $1,200,000 per life-year saved, and the number needed to treat extended from 15 to 152. The results were sensitive to varying assumptions about the cost and efficacy of prophylaxis, as well as the probability of hospitalization, but were less sensitive to the cost of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: In our model, the cost of prophylaxis against RSV for most subgroups of preterm infants was high relative to the benefits realized. Lower costs might permit the benefits of prophylaxis to be extended to additional groups of preterm infants. Authors: Joffe S; Ray GT; Escobar Pediatrics. 1999 Sep;104(3 Pt 1):419-27. Surveillance for endometrial cancer in women receiving tamoxifen. Recent studies showing a protective effect of tamoxifen in women at high risk for breast cancer have expanded the indications of the drug. While acting as an estrogen antagonist in the breast, tamoxifen can have estrogenic effects on the endometrium; consensus opinion is that tamoxifen increases the risk for endometrial cancer. Because an increasing number of women are taking tamoxifen, a strategy for gynecologic surveillance is needed. Studies examining the relation between risk for endometrial cancer and tamoxifen use have conflicting results. However, because of an overall interpretation that tamoxifen use slightly increases risk for endometrial cancer, some researchers advocate routine ultrasonography and endometrial biopsy for screening asymptomatic women receiving tamoxifen. This paper reviews the literature on endometrial cancer in women taking tamoxifen and the usefulness of various screening methods in this setting. Risk factors and screening criteria for endometrial cancer in the general population are discussed, and a strategy for surveillance of women taking tamoxifen is proposed. Patients should be screened for signs or symptoms of endometrial abnormality before taking tamoxifen. This evaluation, which should include a careful history, pelvic examination, and Papanicolaou smear, should be repeated annually while the patient is receiving tamoxifen. Although transvaginal ultrasonography is not recommended for routine screening, it is indicated if an adequate pelvic examination cannot be performed or if additional risk factors are present. The likelihood of abnormality is greater for patients who have abnormal bleeding, discharge, abnormal glandular cells on Papanicolaou smear, or an endometrial measurement on ultrasonography of more than 8 mm; these findings should prompt an aggressive evaluation of the endometrium.

Women's provider preferences for basic gynecology care in a large health maintenance organization To examine women's preferences for the type and sex of the provider of basic gynecological services and the correlates of these preferences, we mailed a cross-sectional survey to 8406 women in a large group model health maintenance organization (HMO) in northern California, with a response rate of 73.6%. Four questions asked women the type (obstetrician/gynecologist, nurse practitioner, or primary care physician) and sex of provider who performed their last pelvic examination and their preferences in type and sex of provider for these examinations. This was a random sample of female HMO members 35-85 years of age who were empaneled with a primary care physician from one of three categories: family practitioner, general internist, or subspecialist. Of the 5164 respondents who received their last pelvic examination at Kaiser Permanente, 56% had seen a gynecologist, 26% a nurse practitioner, and only 18% their own primary care physician for the examination. Of these women, 60.3% reported preferring a gynecologist for basic gynecology care, 12.6% preferred a nurse practitioner, 13.3% preferred their own primary care physician, and 13.8% had no preference. Patients of family practitioners were more likely to prefer their own primary care practitioner than patients of other types of doctors. The strongest independent predictor of preferring a gynecologist over the primary care physician was having seen a gynecologist for the last pelvic examination (OR = 28.3, p < 0.0001). Other independent predictors of preferring a gynecologist were younger age, higher education and income, and having a male primary care physician. Of respondents, 52.2% preferred a female provider for basic gynecological care, and 42.0% had no preference for the sex of the provider. Preferring a female provider was strongly and independently associated with lower income, higher education, nonwhite race, having a male primary care physician, having an older primary care, physician, and having seen a female provider at the last pelvic examination. In this HMO, a majority of women reported a preference for seeing an obstetrician/gynecologist for their routine gynecological care, despite having a primary care physician. This most likely reflects the strong influence of previous patient experience and that familiarity with a particular type of provider leads to preferences for that type. This medical group's structure probably also affects preferences, as in this HMO, primary care physicians can be discouraged from performing pelvic examinations. Many women do prefer female providers for pelvic examinations, but a large percentage have no preference. These women often see male providers for basic gynecological care. As managed care places increasing emphasis on providing integrated, comprehensive primary care, this apparent preference for specialty gynecological care will require Med. 1999 Jul-Aug;8(6):825-33. Rehospitalization in the first two weeks after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit BACKGROUND: High-risk newborns are known to have higher than average utilization of services after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Most studies on this subject report aggregate data over periods ranging from 1 to 3 years postdischarge. Little is known about events that are temporally close to NICU discharge. OBJECTIVES: To characterize rehospitalizations within the first 2 weeks after discharge from six community NICUs. METHODS: We scanned electronic databases and reviewed the charts of rehospitalized infants from six NICUs in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program. We subdivided infants into five groups based on gestational age (GA) and birth hospitalization length of stay (LOS): 1) >/=37 weeks' GA with <4 days LOS 2593); 2) >/=37 weeks' GA with >/=4 days' LOS (n = 1133); 3) from 33 to 36 weeks' GA with <4 days' LOS (n = 545); 4) from 33 to 36 weeks' GA with >/=4 days' LOS (n = 1196); and 5) <33 weeks' GA (n = 587). We performed bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify predictors that might be useful for practitioners. RESULTS: There were 6054 newborns discharged alive from the six study NICUs between August 1, 1992 and December 31, 1995, and 99.5% of these infants remained in the health plan during the 2 weeks after NICU discharge. The overall rehospitalization rate was 2.72%, which is 20% higher than the rate among healthy term newborns in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program (2.26%). The two most common reasons for rehospitalization were jaundice (62/165, 37.6%) and feeding difficulties (25/165, 15.2%). with 33 to 36 weeks' GA and <4 days' LOS were rehospitalized at a significantly higher rate than were all other infants (5.69%); 71% of infants in this group were rehospitalized for jaundice. The following variables predicted rehospitalization in (AOR: 2.94; 95% CI: 1.87-4.62), and birth at facility B, which had the highest rehospitalization rate of the six facilities (AOR: 1.92; CONCLUSIONS: The rate of rehospitalization among NICU graduates is higher than among healthy term infants. Most of the rehospitalizations among infants with from 33 to 36 weeks' GA and <4 days' LOS are for illnesses that are not life-threatening. Collaborative studies and new process and outcomes measures are needed to assess the effectiveness of follow-up strategies in high-risk newborns. Authors: Jul;104(1):e2. Expression of the HPV E7 oncoprotein mimics but does not evoke a p53-dependent cellular DNA damage response pathway. Acute expression of the human papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein in preimmortal human fibroblasts induces changes in the abundances of multiple cellular regulatory proteins. These alterations include a destabilization of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein pRB, stabilization of the tumor suppressor protein p53, and increases in the level of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(cip1). Since the HPV E7 oncoproteins can interfere with several cell cycle checkpoints and similar alterations in the levels of pRB, p53, and p21(cip1) are also observed in a p53-dependent response to DNA damage, we investigated whether E7 expression triggers this signal transduction pathway. The results demonstrate that E7-mediated destabilization of pRB does not require p53 activity and is independent of the ability of E7 to induce apoptosis. Moreover, E7-mediated increases in p21(cip1) levels are largely p53-independent and involve stabilization of the p21(cip1) protein. In contrast the decreases in pRB expression in response to DNA damage involve transcriptional downregulation of RB gene expression. Jun 5;258(2):406-14. doi: 10.1006/viro.1999.9733. Quality of primary care practice in a large HMO according to physician specialty OBJECTIVE: To determine whether physician specialty was associated with differences in the quality of primary care practice and patient satisfaction in a large, group model HMO. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: 10,608 patients ages 35-85 years, selected using stratified probability sampling from the primary care panels of 60 family physicians (FPs), 245 general internists (GIMs), and 55 subspecialty internists (SIMs) at 13 facilities in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California. Patients were surveyed in 1995. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional patient survey measured patient reports of physician performance on primary care measures of coordination, comprehensiveness, and accessibility of care, preventive care procedures, and health promotion. Additional items measured patient satisfaction and health values and beliefs. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients were remarkably similar across physician specialty groups in their health values and beliefs, ratings of the quality of primary care, and satisfaction. Patients rated GIMs higher than FPs on coordination (adjusted mean scores 68.0 and 58.4 respectively, p<.001) and slightly higher on accessibility and prevention; GIMs were rated more highly than SIMs on comprehensiveness (adjusted mean scores 76.4 and 73.8, p<.01). There were no significant differences between specialty groups on a variety of measures of patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Few differences in the quality of primary care were observed by physician specialty in the setting of a large, well-established group model HMO. These similarities may result from the direct influence of practice setting on physician behavior and organization of care or, indirectly, through the types of physicians attracted to a well-established group model HMO. In some settings, practice organization may have more influence than physician specialty on the delivery of primary 1999 Jun;34(2):485-502. Excess maternal transmission of type 2 diabetes. The Northern California Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Registry OBJECTIVE: To assess excess maternal transmission of type 2 diabetes in a multiethnic cohort. Previous studies have reported higher prevalence of diabetes among mothers of probands with type 2 diabetes than among fathers. This analysis is vulnerable to biases, and this pattern has not been observed in all populations or races. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed evidence for excess maternal transmission among 42,533 survey respondents with type 2 diabetes (probands) by calculating the prevalence of diabetes in their siblings and offspring. To assess data quality, we evaluated completeness of family history data provided. Accuracy of family information reported by probands was also evaluated by comparing survey responses in a subsample of 206 probands with family histories modified after further interviews with relatives. RESULTS: Siblings (n = 60,532) of probands with affected mothers had a greater prevalence of diabetes (20%) than those with affected fathers (17%) (P < 0.001 for adjusted odds ratios). Prevalence of diabetes was higher among the offspring (n = 72,087) of female (3.4%) versus male (2.2%) probands (P < 0.001 for adjusted odds ratios). These patterns were evident in all races and both sexes; however, the effect size was clinically insignificant in African-Americans and male offspring. In general, probands provided more complete data about diabetes status for the maternal arm of the pedigree than the paternal arm. Completeness of knowledge was not related to proband sex, but was related to education and race, and inversely to age. Accuracy of proband-reported family history was consistently good (kappa statistics generally > 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Excess maternal transmission was observed in all races and both sexes, although the size of the excess was negligible in African-Americans and male offspring.

Differences in resource use and costs of primary care in a large HMO according to physician specialty OBJECTIVE: To determine if primary care physician specialty is associated with differences in use of health services. DATA SOURCES: Automated outpatient diagnostic, utilization, and cost data on 15,223 members (35-85 years of age) of a large group model HMO. STUDY DESIGN: One-year prospective comparison of primary care provided by 245 general internists (GIMs), 60 family physicians (FPs), and 55 subspecialty internists (SIMs) with case-mix assessed during a nine-month baseline period using Ambulatory Diagnostic Groups. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Adjusting for demographics and case mix, patients of GIMs and FPs had similar hospitalization and ambulatory visit rates, and similar laboratory and radiology costs. Patients of FPs made fewer visits to dermatology, psychiatry, and gynecology (combined visit rate ratio: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.74-0.96). However, they made more urgent care visits (rate ratio 1.19, 95% CI: 1.07-1.23). Patients of SIMs had higher hospitalization rates than those of GIMs (rate ratio 1.33, 95% CI: 1.06-1.68), greater care (rate ratio: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04-1.25), and higher costs 95% CI: 1.01-1.30). The hospitalization difference was due partly to the inclusion of patients with specialty-related diagnoses in panels of SIMs. Radiology and pharmacy differences persisted after excluding these patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this uniform practice environment, specialty differences in primary care practice were small. Subspecialists used slightly more resources than generalists. The broader practice style of FPs may have created access problems for their 1999 Jun;34(2):503-18. Advance directives are more likely among seniors asked about end-of-life care preferences OBJECTIVES: To estimate the proportion of seniors in a large health maintenance organization (HMO) who had been asked about their end-of-life care preferences (EOLCPs) by a clinician and who had completed an advance directive (AD). To examine the association of having had an EOLCP discussion and AD completion. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A random sample of HMO members aged 65 years or older were asked to complete a mailed survey about health and health-related issues in 1996. Data provided by 5117 seniors (80% response rate) were used to estimate the prevalence of EOLCP and AD among seniors overall and in specific risk groups. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of AD completion, especially having been asked about EOLCP. RESULTS: One third of seniors reported having an AD on file with the HMO, but only 15% had talked with a clinician about EOLCP. Both having been asked about EOLCP and having an AD were positively associated with age, but not significantly associated with sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, or self-rated health status. Having been asked by a clinician about EOLCP was significantly associated with completion of an AD. CONCLUSION: Clinicians can play an important role in increasing AD completion rates among seniors by bringing up the subject of EOLCPs. Authors: Gordon NP; Shade SB Arch Intern Med. 12;159(7):701-4. Preventing neonatal group B streptococcal disease: cost-effectiveness in a health maintenance organization and the impact of delayed hospital discharge for newborns who received intrapartum antibiotics OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost and health benefits of implementing a risk factor-based prevention strategy for early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease, using baseline assumptions and costs from a health maintenance organization. With the risk factor-based strategy, intrapartum antibiotics (IPAs) would be provided to women with fever, prolonged rupture of membranes, or preterm labor. A second objective was to determine the impact of an increased length of stay for well term infants with mothers who received IPAs. METHODS: We used decision analysis to compare the costs and benefits of the prevention strategy with usual obstetric practice for a cohort of 100 000 women and their newborn infants. We derived baseline values from a previous study based on chart review and automated cost data from a health maintenance organization in Northern California. In sensitivity analyses, we varied baseline assumptions, including additional costs for observing well term infants who received IPAs. RESULTS: If adherence to guidelines were 100%, 17% of mothers would receive IPAs at a cost of $490,000; $1.6 million would be saved by preventing 66 GBS cases (64% reduction). The net savings would be $1.1 million and 61 life-years. The net cost is sensitive to the cost of caring for well infants who received IPAs. If each term infant of a mother who received IPAs had 1 more day of observation than other term infants, there would be a net cost of $8.1 million; the cost per GBS case prevented would be $120,000 and the cost per life-year saved would be $130,000. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation in a health maintenance organization of a risk factor-based strategy to prevent neonatal GBS disease can prevent substantial disease and be cost saving. However, if the length of hospital stay were extended among well term infants whose mothers received IPAs, the strategy would be relatively costly compared with other medical interventions.

Effects of providing hospital-based doulas in health maintenance organization hospitals OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether providing doulas during hospital-based labor affects mode of delivery, epidural use, breast-feeding, and postpartum perceptions of the birth, self-esteem, and depression. METHODS: This was a randomized study of nullipara enrollees in a group-model health maintenance organization who delivered in one of three health maintenance organization-managed hospitals; 149 had doulas, and 165 had usual care. Study data were obtained from the mothers' medical charts, study intake forms, and phone interviews conducted 4-6 weeks postpartum. RESULTS: Women who had doulas had significantly less epidural use (54.4% versus 66.1%, P < .05) than women in the usual-care group. They also were significantly (P < .05) more likely to rate the birth experience as good (82.5% versus 67.4%), to feel they coped very well with labor (46.8% versus 28.3%), and to feel labor had a very positive effect on their feelings as women (58.0% versus 43.7%) and perception of their bodies' strength and performance (58.0% versus 41.0%). The two groups did not differ significantly in rates of cesarean, vaginal, forceps, or vacuum delivery, oxytocin administration; or breast-feeding, nor did they differ on the postpartum depression or self-esteem measures. CONCLUSION: For this population and setting, labor support from doulas had a desirable effect on epidural use and women's perceptions of birth, but did not alter need for operative deliveries. Authors: work-up': personal reflections on the development of an evidence-based approach toward newborn infections in a managed care organization 'Rule out sepsis' may be the most common discharge diagnosis among infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Although the frequency of sepsis, meningitis, and other confirmed bacterial infections has remained constant (between 1 and 5/1000 live births) for many years, the number of infants evaluated and treated is much higher. Each year in the United States, as many as 600 000 infants experience at least one evaluation for suspected bacterial infection during the birth hospitalization. The number treated is estimated at 130 000 to 400 000 per year. Despite massive overtreatment, delayed diagnosis still occurs. The Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program (KPMCP) considers developing and implementing an evidence-based approach to 'rule out sepsis,' a research and operational priority. To achieve these goals, it is essential to consider two key aspects of the problem. First, it is important to adopt a phenomenologic approach that takes clinicians' personal experience into account. This must include reflection on those aspects of experience often considered 'irrational' or 'subjective.' Second, incorporation of a phenomenologic approach needs to be tempered with sound epidemiologic methods. If one considers these two aspects-physician experience and sound epidemiology-it is clear that much of the existing literature on 'rule out sepsis' is of limited utility. Consequently, the KPMCP has conducted its own studies. These are aimed at characterizing the 'sepsis work-up,' developing electronic datasets that would permit clinicians to simulate various strategies, and developing techniques for ongoing electronic monitoring. This article summarizes the approach taken by the KPMCP Division of Research. It describes the results of a pilot study as well as the development and use of a dedicated neonatology outcomes database, the Kaiser Permanente Neonatal Minimum Data Set (NMDS). The NMDS database includes the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology and permits ongoing monitoring of sepsis 'work-ups' as well as confirmed cases of neonatal infection. The article also describes how the experience from the pilot as well as the NMDS was incorporated in the design of a much larger study on 'rule out sepsis.' Finally, the article describes some important theoretic issues affecting decision rule development and the use of computer simulations in neonatology. These issues are 1) how one handles possible overanalysis of a dataset; 2) how one handles data points that are unstable (eg, the absolute neutrophil count, which can vary considerably depending on age and sampling conditions); and 3) the limitations of decision rules based on computer simulations.

Clinical outcomes and maternal perceptions of an updated model of perinatal care BACKGROUND: Postpartum hospital stays seem likely to remain limited even under new laws which mandate that insurers cover 48-hour hospitalization after uncomplicated delivery. Clinicians, who are increasingly practicing in capitated arrangements, need better information to maximize clinical benefit to mothers and newborns using finite resources. OBJECTIVE AND INTERVENTIONS: This study's aim was to evaluate the clinical outcomes, patient perceptions, and costs of a revised model of perinatal care services. In this model, a new postpartum care center was established for routine follow-up of newborns within 48 hours after hospital discharge, educational efforts were shifted from the postpartum hospitalization to the prenatal period, and lactation consultant hours were increased. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Controlled, nonrandomized (double cohort) study that compared mothers and newborns with hospital stays of 48 hours or less during the Baseline Care (preintervention) study period (N = 344) with those under the Revised Care (postintervention) study period (N = 456). SETTING: The Hayward, California, medical center of Kaiser Permanente, a nonprofit health maintenance organization. DATA COLLECTION: Telephone interviews were attempted with all mothers 3 weeks after delivery. Data on rehospitalizations, emergency department (ED) and clinic visits, and costs during the first 14 postpartum days were collected from computerized databases and chart review. OUTCOME MEASURES: The combined clinical outcome was defined as any undesirable health event, including rehospitalization, an ED visit, or an urgent clinic visit by either the mother or newborn within the first 14 days postpartum, or breastfeeding discontinuation within the first 21 days postpartum. Maternal satisfaction and costs were also studied. RESULTS: Of 876 attempted interviews, 800 were completed (91%). Analyses were adjusted for age, race, education, parity, breastfeeding experience, and other relevant variables. Among the interviewed mother-newborn pairs, 45% in the Revised Care group experienced the combined clinical outcome, compared with 52% in the Baseline Care group. Newborns in the Revised Care group (29%) were significantly less likely to make urgent clinic visits during the first 14 days of life than those in the Baseline Care group (36%). There were no differences between groups in newborn ED visits or rehospitalizations, maternal clinical outcomes, or breastfeeding continuation. Mothers in the Revised Care group expressed higher satisfaction with the newborn's care, the amount of information they received about newborn care and breastfeeding, and the amount of help they received with breastfeeding. Planned hospital care, planned follow-up visits, and unplanned care costs decreased by $149 per delivery, while the new prenatal class and increased lactation consultant services cost $58 per delivery, for an estimated overall reduction in cost. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the revised model of perinatal care in this health maintenance organization medical center improved clinical outcomes and maternal satisfaction for low-risk mothers and newborns without increasing costs.

Structured review of neonatal deaths in a managed care organisation We sought to quantify neonatal mortality (< 28 days) in a 10-hospital system, determine what proportion was associated with suboptimal neonatal care and make recommendations on how neonatal mortality rates (NMRs) could be used in quality improvement efforts. Deaths were identified using electronic linkage to the State of California Death Certificate Tapes. Individual fatalities were reviewed by a minimum of two physicians who did not care for the infant. Deaths were classified as either being associated with suboptimal care or not. For deaths where suboptimal care was an issue, emphasis was on delineating the process involved in the death. Subjects were all neonatal deaths among 64,469 babies born in 1990-91 in the 10 birth facilities of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, Northern California Region. A total of 241 neonatal deaths were identified. Adjusting for prematurity by increasing the follow-up period in preterm babies (included as neonatal deaths if they died up to 40 weeks corrected gestational age + 27.9 days) increased overall mortality rates by 5%. Birthweight-specific NMRs in Kaiser Permanente are similar to those of other published reports. Among the 198 deaths in babies weighing > or = 500 g at birth, only 14 (7%) were possibly associated with suboptimal care. In populations with access to health insurance, reporting only aggregate NMRs is of limited use. The number of deaths that could be ascribed to suboptimal neonatal care is very small and measuring variations in rates of such deaths is difficult. Future measurements of quality of care will require more sophisticated measures, database systems, review strategies and dissemination methods. Authors: Escobar Oct;12(4):422-36. Use of and interest in alternative therapies among adult primary care clinicians and adult members in a large health maintenance organization During spring 1996, random samples of adult primary care physicians, obstetrics-gynecology physicians and nurse practitioners, and adult members of a large northern California group practice model health maintenance organization (HMO) were surveyed by mail to assess the use of alternative therapies and the extent of interest in having them incorporated into HMO-delivered care. Sixty-one percent (n = 624) of adult primary care physicians, 70% (n = 157) of obstetrics-gynecology clinicians, and 50% (2 surveys, n = 1,507 and n = 17,735) of adult HMO members responded. During the previous 12 months, 25% of adults reported using and nearly 90% of adult primary care physicians and obstetrics-gynecology clinicians reported recommending at least 1 alternative therapy, primarily for pain management. Chiropractic, acupuncture, massage, and behavioral medicine techniques such as meditation and relaxation training were most often cited. Obstetrics-gynecology clinicians used herbal and homeopathic medicines more often than adult primary care physicians, primarily for menopause and premenstrual syndrome. Two thirds of adult primary care physicians and three fourths of obstetrics-gynecology clinicians were at least moderately interested in using alternative therapies with patients, and nearly 70% of young and middle-aged adult and half of senior adult members were interested in having alternative therapies incorporated into their health care. Adult primary care physicians and members were more interested in having the HMO cover manipulative and behavioral medicine therapies than homeopathic or herbal medicines.

Screening mammography in an integrated health care system: the Kaiser permanente experience In this paper, we describe the attributes of a comprehensive approach to breast cancer screening possible in an integrated health care system. We define an integrated health care system as one in which comprehensive preventive and medical care is provided to a defined population, by a defined panel of providers, and in which this care can be tracked using automated electronic data systems. Guided by the Pathways Conceptual Framework, it is possible to identify and systematically address (through research and interventions) the multiple predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors at the individual and organizational level associated with each step along the screening process. This framework is helpful as both a planning and an evaluation tool, in identifying places in the screening and follow-up process that could benefit from concerted quality improvement efforts and in guiding an evaluation of those efforts. We describe examples from research and organizational programmatic efforts, and use the framework to point to additional areas for further investigation and potential organizational intervention. These examples use a variety of research methods, impact the breast cancer screening pathway in different places, and therefore show how it is possible to approach the broad issue of reduction of breast cancer mortality from multiple perspectives. Integrated health care systems, unlike more traditional academic settings, are well suited to supporting this full spectrum of research while also providing the context for its application.

OBJECTIVE: Our intent was to compare the management of patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance on cytologic screening at an academic center to published guidelines. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the management of 223 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance cervical smears. Patients with a history of dysplasia were excluded. The time interval to and nature of follow-up testing was determined, and the influence of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance qualifiers and provider specialty analyzed. RESULTS: Initial follow-up consisted of repeat cytologic examination alone in 94% of cases. Of patients with follow-up, 29% were retested within 2 months and 68% within 4 months. No conclusive differences in management were found by qualifier type or by provider specialty. Subsequent high-grade dysplasia was found in 2.6% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: A discrepancy exists between published guidelines and actual management of patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance smears at this medical center. Patients often undergo follow-up testing at shorter intervals than those suggested despite a low likelihood of finding high-grade disease. Authors: doi: 10.1016/s0002-9378(98)70537-x. Type of health care coverage and the likelihood of being screened for cancer OBJECTIVES: This study explored whether type of outpatient health coverage affected the likelihood of men and women aged 20 to 64 years receiving recommended cancer screening procedures. METHODS: Data from the 1989 and 1990 California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Surveys were used to compare Pap smear, mammogram, fecal occult blood test, and proctoscopic examination rates for adults with three different types of private health care coverage (Group/staff model health maintenance organization, Independent Practice Association Model health maintenance organization, indemnity plan) and no outpatient health insurance. Logistic regression models were used to control for sociodemographic and health characteristics and whether individuals had a usual health care provider. RESULTS: Individuals with Group Model health maintenance organization coverage were significantly more likely than those with indemnity plans to have had recent cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screening, whereas screening likelihood for those with Independent Practice Association model health maintenance organization coverage did not differ substantially from those with indemnity plans. Individuals with no outpatient coverage were less likely to be screened than those with outpatient coverage. The most consistently significant predictor across cancer screening procedures for both men and women was having a usual doctor who knew their medical history. CONCLUSIONS: Adults who had private outpatient insurance were more likely to undergo recommended cancer detection procedures than those who did not. Adults who belonged to a health maintenance organization, which emphasizes and pays for a broader spectrum preventive care, were more likely to receive Pap smears, mammograms, and fecal occult blood tests than those covered by indemnity plans. Receiving care primarily from one doctor significantly increased the likelihood of having screening procedures, irrespective of type of health plan.

Cigarette smoking and risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma subtypes We examined the hypothesis that cigarette smoking increases the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtypes in a cohort of approximately 253,000 members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, ages 16-84 years, who completed a self-administered questionnaire during the period 1964-1991 that ascertained smoking history. Using information from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry that operates in the area and the Kaiser Permanente cancer registry, we identified 674 incident cases of NHL through 1993. We observed a positive association between smoking and risk of follicular lymphoma (compared with nonsmokers: former smokers, relative risk = 1.9 with 95% confidence interval = 1.2-2.9; current smokers, relative risk = 1.4 with 95% confidence interval = 0.9-2.2), although the strength of the association did not increase consistently with increasing duration and intensity of smoking. We observed no relationship between smoking status and the risks of small cell lymphocytic, diffuse, or high-grade lymphoma, nor was smoking related to the risk of all histological types of NHL combined. These results give limited evidence for a relationship between smoking and the risk of follicular "}
