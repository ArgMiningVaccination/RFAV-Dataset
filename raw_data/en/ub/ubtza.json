It has been used as a traditional remedy for treating nerve pain, migraines, insomnia, anxiety, and muscle spasms due to nervous tension. More recently, animal studies have shown that bark extracts of Jamaica dogwood have various healing properties. These include anti-inflammatory, sedative, and antispasmodic effects. Jamaica dogwood is available in liquid extract and tincture forms as well as in tea form. Root bark is also available and can be found in pieces about 1 to 2 inches in length and 1/8 inch in thickness. Keep in mind that there is considerable variation in the chemical constituents of Jamaica dogwood harvested from different geographic regions. The plant also has narcotic properties. It can cause numbness and tremors, slow the heart rate (bradycardia), and even result in death if too much is used. Jamaica dogwood should only be used while under supervision of a qualified holistic health practitioner.
