This section summarizes a sampling of five studies - providing just a taste of the available research. - TCM Herb, Astragalus, Protects Heart Attack Patients Better Than Current Drugs A new study from Newcastle University-UK found that heart attack patients treated with a compound derived from a plant long used in traditional Chinese medicine, astragalus, experienced significantly reduced inflammation (up to 62%, and 30% more than with traditional anti-inflammatory medications.) Patients also experienced less chest and joint pains. Unlike current post-heart-attack treatments, the herbal treatment not only did not compromise patients' immune systems, it actually increased immune cell count.

Irvine study found a powerful painkiller in a plant used for millennia in TCM. The chemical compound dehydrocorybulbine, or DHCB in the Corydalis plant was found to effectively alleviate three different types of pain in mice - acute pain, inflammatory pain and injury-induced neuropathic pain. And the study also showed that mice didn't build up resistance to it, which indicates it could one day be used for managing chronic pain in humans. Conclusion: it's a promising lead in pain management.
