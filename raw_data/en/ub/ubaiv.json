For example, in a pool game, when we see a cue ball colliding with an object ball, we perceive not only the motions of the two balls, but also can reason that the physical motion of the object ball is caused by the cue ball. This ability to perceive causality of physical motions is based on our knowledge of physical laws of collisions, daily practices of the laws, and the representation of relations between physical items (Fonlupt 2003). And the process of perceiving physical causality is fast, automatic, and irresistible (see Scholl & Tremoulet 2000, for a review of perceptual causality). Likewise, we also seek explanations of abstract social events, in order to understand the social world (e.g., Heider 1958; Kelley 1967). We are curious about why we or others have certain behaviors. For example, in interpersonal events, we wonder whether the events are caused by us or by other people (e.g., Jones & Nisbett 1971), and what kinds of causes lead to the events (e.g., Weiner 1972). However, unlike in the case of the two colliding balls in which we can rely on clear physical laws of collisions, the process of how people make attributions in social events is less clear. Researchers from various fields have studied this topic under related terms for a long time, such as causation in philosophy (e.g., Hume 1748/2007), causal inferences in cognitive psychology (e.g., Schustack & Sternberg 1981), attribution in social psychology (e.g., Heider 1958), and (implicit) causality in linguistics (e.g., Caramazza et al. 1977; Garvey & Caramazza 1974). This thesis is about causality in language and cognition. Causality has long been recognized as an important discourse relation in linguistics and discourse studies (e.g., Pander Maat & Sanders 2001). Between clauses, causality can be expressed by causal connectives, such as because. Within clauses, causality can be expressed by verbs either explicitly or implicitly. (1) John killed Peter For example, the action verb kill in example 1 has the explicit meaning that John caused Peter to die. Therefore, there is no doubt about John being the explicit cause of the event. However, when people are asked why this event happened, they may provide implicit causal explanations either about John, such as because John hated Peter , or about Peter, such as because Peter had ruined John's career . When people have a clear preference for one causer or reason (the subject or NP1 position of John) over the other (the object or NP2 position of Peter), we consider this verb as having an NP1 implicit causality bias, and we call it an IC1 verb. When the preference is the other way around, we consider the verb an NP2 implicit causality verb, and call it an IC2 verb. This thesis studies how linguistic factors interact with social-psychological and cultural factors in bringing about implicit causal interpretations in language. The thesis investigates how people under different contextual and socio-cultural conditions attribute causes in sentences with verbs expressing interpersonal events and suggesting particular causal configurations between the protagonists.11 IntroductionIn Section 1.2, we will first introduce the phenomenon of implicit causality connected to interpersonal verbs in language. In Section 1.3, we will survey the major theoretical explanations of implicit causality as put forward in the literature over the past decades. We will show that explanations gradually have shifted from purely intrinsic semantic and syntactic characteristics of verbs or sentences to more socio-psychological interactional aspects associated with the events expressed by the verb and with the broader context of the utterance. On the basis of this overview, we will explain the interpersonal variables we will be focusing on in this thesis: self perspective, group membership, and culture. In Section 1.4, we review the methods used to elicit implicit causality biases connected to interpersonal verbs in language, and explain the methodological choices we made in this thesis. 1.2 The implicit causality (IC) bias in language Implicit causality is in particular relevant in some types of transitive verbs that describe interactions between individuals, so called 'interpersonal verbs' (e.g., Rudolph & F\u00f6rsterling 1997, p. 193). Interpersonal verbs have a subject and an object which can be considered the explicit or implicit cause of an event. In example 1, John can be seen as the explicit cause of Peter being killed: he carried out the action resulting in Peter's dead. As suggested above, however, explicit causes as in 1a, are not so much relevant in implicit causality attribution. More relevant in attributing implicit causality is the reason why events happen (Pickering & Majid 2007). Both John and Peter may be the reason why John decided to kill Peter, as shown in examples 1b and 1c. (1a) Johni killed Peter because hei drove over him. (1b) John killed Peteri because hei had ruined John's career. (1c) Johni killed Peter because hei hated Peter. When asked to complete example 1, about half of the participants will choose a completion similar to 1b, and the other half a completion like 1c, as has been shown in a large-scale study on implicit causality verbs (Ferstl et al. 2011). Many other interpersonal verbs, however, have shown stable preferences in favor of the subject (NP1) or the object (NP2) as being the reason for the event described in the verb. (2) John amused Peter, because... (3) Susan admired Mary, because... In example 2, language users tend to provide causes for the event connected to the first protagonist or noun phrase (NP1), such as because he (John) sang beautiful songs. Conversely, there are verbs that people tend to provide causes connected to the second protagonist or noun phrase (NP2). In example 3, people tend to provide explanations about Mary, such as because she (Mary) was good at math . 112 Chapter 1 So, when interpersonal verbs show a clear preference for NP1 or NP2 as explanation, reason or cause of the event, they are called implicit causality verbs (Garvey & Caramazza 1974). Verbs implicitly suggesting the NP1 to be the causer of the event described by the verb are considered IC1 verbs, like amuse in example 2. Verbs suggesting the NP2 to be the causer of the event are considered IC2 verbs, like admire in example 3. The IC bias turns out to be a stable and strong effect found in both production and comprehension studies. In language production experiments, participants have to respond to verbs, sentences, or scenarios so as to elicit which of two protagonists (NP1 or NP2) they consider the causer of the events described by the verb (e.g., Caramazza et al. 1977; Garvey & Caramazza 1974; Garvey et al. 1974). Based on these preferences researchers determine the bias direction of the IC verbs (NP1 or NP2), and also the strength of the bias: the more people on average choose NP1 or NP2 as causer of the event, the stronger the NP1 or NP2 bias of the verb is believed to be. In comprehension studies, participants are asked to read different versions of IC biased sentences, either versions which are congruent or incongruent with the IC-bias of the verb. The a-versions of examples 2 and 3 below can be considered expected or congruent with the bias of the IC1 and IC2 verb respectively, while the b-versions are incongruent. Comprehension studies convincingly show that participants need more time to process such incongruent sentences (e.g., Caramazza et al. 1977; Cozijn et van Berkum 2006). (2a) Johni amused Peter, because hei sang beautiful songs. (NP1 - congruent) (2b) John amused Peteri, because hei was easily amused. (NP1 - incongruent) (3a) Susan admired Maryi, because at (NP2 - congruent) (3b) Susani admired Mary, because shei was just a little girl. (NP2 - incongruent) Since the early IC bias experiments (e.g., Garvey & Caramazza 1974), the IC bias effect has often been repeated and refined. Many studies have focused on developing classifications of verbs which best explain the IC biases effects found (e.g., Brown & Fish 1983; Rudolph & F\u00f6rsterling 1997; Semin & Fiedler 1988;1991). In the slipstream of these studies, gradually more knowledge has been built up about the conceptual aspects of verbs responsible for the IC bias effect, in particular with respect to the event type and valence of the verb. In distinguishing types of verbs, a major distinction has been made between verbs expressing events 'happening' within a limited time frame, and having a clear end point (i.e., being telic), such as action verbs (e.g., kill), and verbs covering a longer duration, often referring to mental rather than physical events, such as state verbs (e.g., love) (e.g., Brown & Fish 1983; Semin & Fiedler 1991). Another pervasive conceptual element found to be at work in IC bias effects is the polarity of events expressed in IC verbs. The well-known psychological effect of negative versus positive events (e.g., Taylor 1991) turns out to be active in IC verbs as well (e.g., Semin & Marsman 1994). At the same time, in the past decades the idea of implicit causality being exclusively caused by the semantics of the verb, has been challenged successfully. In many studies, variables on different levels have been argued to be co-responsible for implicit causality effects, such as an active versus passive syntactic construction (e.g., Au 1986; 13 IntroductionKasof & Lee 1993), the gender (e.g., Lafrance et al. 1997) or the animacy of the protagonists (e.g., Corrigan 1988). More recently, variables have been studied pertaining to specific contextual aspects of the events expressed in the verbs, for example whether the event has been presented as typical or not (e.g., van den Hoven & Ferstl 2018), or whether or not the speaker is involved in the event expressed in the verb (e.g., Wang et al. 2017). Another recent line of research studies the socio-psychological interaction between protagonists in an event expressed by the verb. An important variable proven to affect implicit causality here is the tendency of people to push away negative events and embrace positive events, known as the self-serving bias (e.g., Heider 1958; Weiner 1972; 1985). In Section 1.2, we will survey these lines of research in a bit more detail, thereby making clear how our thesis contributes to each of these lines. Here, we wrap up this introductory section by positioning ourselves in relation to some basic distinctions about implicit causality as presented above. In our thesis, we adhere to the definition of implicit causality as put forward in Pickering and Majid (2007, p. 785) that 'it provides an abstraction of the type of reason that is most likely to be provided for the event, and indicates which entity the reason tends to be about'. Furthermore, in assessing the sources of implicit causality, we acknowledge the importance of verb types. In particular, in this thesis we will use the large grouping of verb types based on two clear extremes: on the one hand, verbs expressing physical actions lexicalizing specific concrete actions hardly allowing interpretation on how events exactly took place (e.g., an action verb like kick expressing not only what happened but also how it happened), on the other extreme, verbs expressing mental states leaving ample room for explanations on who did this and why. In studying socio-psychological and cultural variables responsible for implicit causality effects, we mainly focus on verbs that leave room for processes of implicit causality, in particular mental state verbs (like love) and mental activity verbs (like lie). Yet, in the thesis we will not capitalize on the many fine-grained distinctions in verb types and semantic roles made in the literature, often claimed to cover and explain IC effects found in specific situations. Rather, we will consider the level of event types relevant in explaining effects of socio-psychological and cultural variables. We start from the observation that effects of implicit causality always 'happen' in context when verbs are used in sentences and scenarios. Many effects found over the last decades pertain to specific aspects of the events evoked by IC verbs rather than by the semantics of the verbs itself, think of the gender of the participants or the negativity of the event. Rather than extending the theoretical importance of verb types so as to cover these variables, we take the type of event as major basis for the study of implicit causality. We acknowledge that many contextual variables can affect or supplement basic IC preferences as provided by the verb type. As an illustration, many of us will consider the reasons provided in examples 1b and 1c more adequate than the direct cause in example 1a. But it is easy to imagine a context which makes example 1a the most acceptable version, e.g., when people are discussing who is responsible for the killing of John, who is lying there dead in the middle of the street. In such a context, example 1a produced by the only witness of the car accident is very accurate. 114 Chapter 1 1.3 Factors affecting the implicit causality bias 1.3.1 Verb semantics: verb type, thematic role and event type The study of implicit causality in language started from an initial observation of interpersonal verbs being observed as giving rise to differential causal attributions. In an attempt to find regularities in IC bias directions, different classifications of verbs have been proposed. A classification acknowledged widely among causality researchers is the difference between action verbs and state verbs, initially proposed by Kanouse and Abelson (1967) in the difference between manifest and subjective verbs, and later refined in other studies (e.g., Garvey & Caramazza 1974; Brown & Fish 1983). Action verbs refer to behavioral interactions that involve 'the voluntary musculature' (Brown & Fish 1983, p. 247) and express a relationship 'which is directly observable and relatively delimited in time' (Kanouse & Abelson 1967, p. 159). State verbs describe mental interactions that result in relatively involuntary mental states or experiences (Brown & Fish 1983, p. 242) and 'express an orientation of the subject toward the object which is relatively enduring and not directly observable' (Kanouse & Abelson 1967, p. 159). Brown and Fish (1983) add to that an important insight: interpersonal verbs imply two protagonists, syntactically expressed in a subject and object position. Semantically they play a part in the schema expressed by the verb. For example, in a typical action verb like kill in example 1, the subject (John) can be said to be the agent of the action while the object (Peter ) is the patient. Brown and Fish argue that the semantic roles rather than the verb types determine the implicit causality bias. They distinguished two types of state verbs to make their point. In a verb such as like, the subject can be said to experience the liking, while the object is the one giving rise to the experience, hence, they consider like to be an experiencer-stimulus (ES) verb. The verb impress on the other hand, has an object experiencing the event and a subject which is the stimulus, hence, impress is considered a stimulus-experiencer verb. This resulted in a widely acknowledged tri-partition of verbs, with action verbs having predominantly an IC1 bias, and state verbs predominantly having the bias on the part of the stimulus semantic role (i.e., SE verbs preferring IC1 and ES verbs IC2). Brown and Fish (1983) explain these regularities using the idea that the IC bias is located in the term which is the most noteworthy or characteristic: in their terms, NP1 agents/stimuli are considered to represent 'low consensus' while the corresponding NP2 term is said to represent low distinctiveness (Kelley 1967). Conversely, NP2 evocators or stimuli are said to represent high distinctiveness while their corresponding NP1 term is said to represent high consensus. The lower the consensus in NP1 terms, and the higher the distinctiveness, the more chance there is to attract the IC bias of a verb. Though these two terms have a different polarity bias, they represent the same semantic idea of being more characteristic, and thus being more noteworthy to be used to find reasons for an event. The effect of these notions can be illustrated in the variant examples of 2 and 3: adding the semantic item only results in strengthening the low consensus of the agent in action sentence 2c, as well as the high distinctiveness of the stimulus in state sentence 3c.15 Introduction(2c) Only Johni amused Peter, because hei sang beautiful songs. (low consensu s: Few/ no other people amuse Peter; low distinctiveness: John amuses many other people) (3c) Susan admired only Maryi, because shei was good at math. (high consensus : many other people admire Mary; high distinctiveness: Susan admires few/no other people) In sum, the major attribution biases found in state and action verbs can be explained using the notions of consensus and distinctiveness: Rudolph and F\u00f6rsterling (1997) and Hoffman and Tchir (1990) found a high correlation between attribution assessments on the one hand, and assessments of distinctiveness and consensus of the thematic roles in different types of verbs on the other. A related explanation of IC bias regularities in relation to verb types and thematic roles is found in the observation that for most of the interpersonal verbs with IC bias, languages have adjectives derived from the verbs expressing the behavior of the IC biased protagonist, i.e., the agent, evocator or stimulus, while languages have hardly such adjectives expressing the behavior of the unbiased protagonists, the patient or experiencer (Brown & Fish 1983; Hoffman & Tchir 1990). For example, the English language has two adjectives derived from the verbs in sentences 2 and 3: amusing and admirable. The two adjectives clearly show the regularity as observed by Brown and Fish, as they both apply to the biased protagonist: John (NP1) is amusing, while Mary (NP2) is admirable. This explanation is claimed to show direct linguistic influence on cognition and thought. For example, Hoffman and Tchir (1990) consider the IC bias the result of frequently using and activating these adjectives while processing and producing IC verb sentences. Experimental evidence in favor of this claim is inconclusive, however (Hoffman & Tchir 1990; Rudolph & F\u00f6rsterling 1997; Semin & Marsman 1994). Though there are many clear associations between thematic roles and the IC direction of verbs, verb semantics cannot explain the full picture of the IC bias, especially not in action verbs. In action verbs one expects the agent or NP1 as biased protagonist. However, as observed by Semin and Fiedler (1988; 1991), not all action verbs have the expected IC1 bias. They proposed to distinguish action verbs into descriptive action verbs and interpretative action verbs, with the former type having no clear IC bias and the latter type having an IC1 bias. Descriptive action verbs are verbs directly expressing a physically invariant feature, such as calling involving a phone. These verbs are merely neutral descriptions of actions without interpretation of the actions. Instead, interpretations of the actions are variable, highly dependent on the context. The cause of calling could be either related to the NP1 or the NP2 (e.g., John called Peter because he felt lonesome). Thus, descriptive action verbs do not show a clear IC bias direction (Fiedler & Semin 1988). Compared to descriptive action verbs, interpretative action verbs are slightly more abstract: they do not directly express an invariant physical action feature and their interpretation is more consistent across contexts (Fiedler & Semin 1988). Take the action verb attack as an example. Unlike verbs expressing specific actions, like kick or strangle, the action of attacking does not involve specific invariable features, as you can attack someone in many ways (using sticks, guns, or words). So, interpretative action verbs do more than describe an action specifically, they abstract away from the concrete actions and offer some kind of generalized interpretation of the action. 116 Chapter 1 Action verbs can also have a strong IC2 bias, in particular verbs which can be considered induced actions, or re-actions rather than actions (e.g., Au 1986; 1958). For example, when an agent- subject thanks an object protagonist, the reason for doing so is probably induced or evocated by the object protagonist, for example, because he has done good things for the subject first. Therefore, the object protagonist in thank is more an 'evocator' of the action, than a patient, which explains the IC2 bias, comparable to the role of stimulus in IC2 mental verbs, a thematic role which is also considered responsible for the bias direction of the verb. The idea that the bias direction of action verbs is not only determined by the agent role, but by the one who elicits the action, may indicate that verb semantics is not the only factor influencing the IC bias. More recent evidence for the role of verb semantics in the IC bias comes from Hartshorne and colleagues (e.g., Hartshorne & Snedeker 2013; Hartshorne 2014, Hartshorne et al. 2015). They do not claim the IC bias can be predicted simply on the basis of a simple feature of the lexical item of the verb, as in the early proposals, but on the basis of the verb's distribution across all possible syntactic structures available to each verb. The basis for this is VerbNet, an extensive computational verb lexicon for English providing syntactic-semantic descriptions of verb classes (Levin 1993; Kipper et al. 2008). This account results in semantic profiles of verbs and in verb classes distinguished on the basis of the verbs' ability to occur in particular semantic verb sentence frames, which makes the classification empirical rather than theoretical. The verb like, for example, is characterized by its ability to act adequately in the list of semantic structures presented in 4. (4a) NP V NP (The tourists liked the painting.) (4b) NP V NP [for] NP (I liked him for his honesty.) (4c) NP V NP [in] NP (I liked the honesty in him.) (4d) NP V [that] S (I liked that he was so honest.) (4e) NP V S-ing (I like writing.) (4f) NP V NP S-ing (I like him wearing suits.) Verbs are classified and typified by comparing their semantic structures in VerbNet. The semantics of these classes in combination with expectations about the content of the (because ) subclause are seen as signaling who caused the event or state described by the verb. Rather than using a small set of verbs specifically chosen because they are known to have a strong object or subject bias, as most IC studies do, they used the VerbNet classification method in a pronoun elicitation experiment with the 720 most frequent words, and they compared the results with existing verb classifications (Brown & Fish 1983; Au 1986; Rudolph & F\u00f6rsterling 1997; Semin & Fiedler 1991). They presented participants with a complete sentence including a non-existing word in the completion, as in example 5. (5) Sally frightens Mary because she is a dax. // Who do you think is the dax? // Choose Sally or Mary. 17 IntroductionThey concluded that none of the classifications were accurate on action verbs. VerbNet, on the other hand, managed to create reliable classes of action verbs with or without IC bias for a number (n=135) of the non-polysemic verbs in this corpus (n=328). As such, Hartshorne and Snedeker (2013) provide strong evidence for the role of semantic structures being the driving force of the IC bias. Theoretically, this would mean that given their syntactic-semantic profile verbs should have either an IC1, an IC2, or no IC bias, which would mean that IC bias is a categorical distinction, rather than a continuous one, as suggested in many other proposals (e.g., Garvey et al. 1974; Semin & Fiedler 1991). Their take here is that there is indeed an underlying categorical distinction, which however is masked by many different factors, the most important being the polysemous nature of most verbs, which offers a result showing a continuum of bias strengths. In summary, the IC bias is concerned with how people make implicit causal interpretations of events described by IC verbs. In the process of interpretations, verb semantics and thematic roles play an undeniably important role in determining the IC bias. Therefore, semantic verb types and basic IC biases of verbs should be taken into account in studying implicit causality. In this thesis, we will focus on verbs with a well-known consistent and strong IC bias direction, as we consider them the best starting point for the study of additional variables affecting implicit causality. 1.3.2 Events and world knowledge Many researchers acknowledge the role of other factors than just verb semantics in IC preferences. For example, Hartshorne and Snedeker (2013, p. 1297) make a strong case for integrating the role of world knowledge. As said, they consider the semantic verb classes to reflect systematic differences in the conceptualization of event types, but they realize that not only knowledge of verb semantics plays a part, but also knowledge of how these events typically occur in real life. They consider semantic structures primordial, as language users first have to acquire an IC bias connected to each verb, but different contextual conditions can modify the initial bias. This position is similar to the one presented in Pickering and Majid (2007). They consider implicit causality an inference from a description of the event expressed by the verb, rather than just part of the semantics of the verb. The implicit causality in their view is an abstraction of the type of reason that is most likely to be provided for the event, and indicates which entity the reason tends to be about. Thus, it expresses the probability that specific causes attached to specific entities are connected to specific events. When implicit causality is claimed to be part of the meaning of the verb, it is difficult to explain why it is not a matter of all or none (0 or 100%) but a matter of degree. All verbs show exceptions, so called incongruent cases, which are perfectly acceptable reasons for the event. So rather than considering it part of the meaning of the verb, they consider implicit causality a probabilistic notion predicting the reasons people give for events. When considering it part of the event there is no need to postulate new types of semantic roles. For example, for IC2 action verbs like thank, there is no need to create the thematic role of evocator. For Pickering and Majid, the object of the verb thank is just a 118 Chapter 1 semantic patient, as it receives the result of the thanking. But the IC2 bias expresses the fact that most language users apparently prefer to connect the reason for this event to this patient position. Of course, in computing the inference of implicit causality connected to the verb, semantic aspects of the verb are crucial. But this view leaves open the role of other variables which may change the IC probabilities of the verb. Several studies have investigated how specific instantiations of events in context are able to affect the interpretation of events and IC biases. These studies show that the addition of specific contextual information and specific world knowledge affect IC preferences considerably. For example, Majid et al. (2006) tested how quantifiers, manipulating set size influence the IC bias by adding one extra context sentence before the IC verb sentence (e.g., Few/Nearly all of people pleased Paul. Ellen pleased Paul, because...). For each IC verb sentence, they asked participants to choose one of the two NPs as the causer, and participants showed a stronger NP1 bias in the version with a quantifier denoting small amounts, compared to the version with a quantifier denoting large amounts. They explained the effect of set size quantifiers in terms of polarity connotations coming with the quantifiers. In the 'nearly all' version, the quantifier suggests a positive interpretation indicating that many people please Paul. Reader's attention is drawn to Paul, and they tend to attribute the sentence to this protagonist. In contrast, the 'few' variant is interpreted negatively, drawing attention to large the group of people who did not please Paul and indicates Ellen's action to be unusual. Therefore, participants tended to attribute the sentence to Ellen. Thus, specific additional world knowledge is able to change IC preferences. In a similar fashion, van den Hoven and Ferstl (2018) manipulated the implicit assumptions underlying the normal interpretation of verbs by adding specific world knowledge information, and tested how this contextual information affects the IC bias. Participants were asked to read and complete scenarios in two versions, such as example 6. (6) Marcel felt GREAT /INADEQUATE. Since he graduated from art school three years ago, he had had NO /A LOT OF problems finding work. One day he went to the workplace of an old classmate, Fabienne, to see her paintings. She turned out to be quite UNTALENTED /SUCCESSFUL. In the studio, Marcel criticized Fabienne because... (van den Hoven & Ferstl 2018, p. 569). The variation was used to change the typical interpretation of the verb criticize, in particular the sincerity of the act of criticizing. The contextual information on Marcel feeling inadequate and having a lot of problems and on Fabienne being successful may cast doubt about the justness and sincerity of Marcel's criticism, and therefore may tend readers to find reasons for Marcel's criticism more on his part (because he felt bad), than on the part of Fabienne (because she did something bad), thus decreasing the strong NP2 bias of the verb. Thus, the contextual information changed the typical event interpretation of Marcel blaming Fabienne because she did something blameworthy. The studies show that the typical interpretation of events associated with the typical IC preferences can be modulated by world knowledge and specific contextual information.19 Introduction1.3.3 Verb polarity Verb or event polarity has been shown to affect the interpretation of sentences greatly (e.g., Kanouse 1972). It is also able to affect IC preferences. For example, the NP1 bias is found to be stronger in negative verbs than positive verbs (e.g., Franco & De Grada 1991; Semin & Marsman 1994), though the effect is not found in other studies (Rudolph & F\u00f6rsterling 1997, p. 203). Valence also plays a role in relation to gender. For example, Lafrance et al. (1997) show that women were more strongly influenced by the valence of the verb than men. These findings suggest that the IC bias may be more likely to be influenced by negative verbs than positive verbs. In order to investigate a potential effect of verb valence, in this thesis, we carefully controlled verb valence. 1.3.4 Properties of protagonists In many early IC experiments, the two protagonists involved in IC verb sentences are placeholders, such as two proper names. These placeholders give minimal information on protagonists and are used to prevent extraneous variables from affecting attributions in IC verb sentences. Yet, properties of protagonists such as gender, animacy, and social status, are also important cues in IC verb sentences. Firstly, researchers found that genders of protagonists affect the IC bias in a way that males are more likely to be considered as causers. For example, Lafrance et al. (1997) showed that in IC verb sentences with two mixed gender protagonists, male protagonists were rated more likely to be causers than female protagonists, especially in negative verb sentences. This has been confirmed in Ferstl et al. (2011), in which they used a sentence completion task with gender mixed protagonists (\"M verbed F because ...\", or \"F verbed M because ...\") and found that male protagonists were more likely to be re-mentioned as event causers in completions than female protagonists. Lafrance et al. (1997) believed that this gender difference in IC verb sentences is due to unequal social power between males and females, and that male protagonists are considered as more powerful, and therefore, more causal. Secondly, Lafrance et al. (1997) also found that protagonists with a higher social status were more likely to be rated as causers than those with a lower social status, such as employers and secretaries. Corrigan (2001) further studied influences of social status on the IC bias from the perspective of \"goodness of thematic roles\". By goodness of thematic roles, Corrigan means that people hold expectations about an interaction between protagonists' social status, adherence valence, and the valence of events described by IC verbs. Corrigan showed that protagonists with a more powerful and positive status were judged more likely to be causers of positive events, such as grandma in a grandma-infant pair, while protagonists with a more powerful and negative status were judged more likely to be causers of negative events, such as a mugger in a mugger-passerby pair. Once this expectation is violated, the IC bias is influenced. For example, an IC1 verb sentence, a mugger struck a passerby, fits people's expectation about the two protagonists, and participants tend to choose the NP1 mugger as the causer. However, when they read a passerby struck a mugger, the tendency to choose the NP1 protagonist was weakened or even overridden. 120 Chapter 1 Thirdly, protagonists' animacy has also been shown to influence the IC bias. As noted by Pickering and Majid (2007, p. 786), animacy manipulations may change thematic role assignments drastically (e.g., an agentive animate subject as in john amused Mary, which is not agentive in the inanimate version as in the picture amused Mary). The influence of animacy on IC preferences is studied systematically by Corrigan (1988; 2001) in a series of rating experiments. She showed that inanimate protagonists were rated more likely to be the causers. Corrigan manipulated animacy of the two protagonists in IC each sentence, she asked participants to rate the likelihood of the two protagonists being the causer. She found that for experiencer-stimulus verbs and action verbs not only verb types, but also protagonists' animacy influenced the IC bias strength. Compared to the two animate NPs condition, the inanimate NP in the two mixed conditions was rated more likely to be the causer. She believed that IC verb sentences typically describe events with two animate protagonists and once one of the protagonists is replaced with an inanimate one, the inanimate protagonist was usually considered as atypical, and therefore, more causal. In order to test whether there was such a relation between animacy and prototypicality in IC verb sentences, she asked participants to rate the prototypicality of the IC verb sentences in the four conditions and found that the IC bias rating order of the four conditions was the same as the prototypicality ranking order, again confirming the effect of event typicality discussed above. In this thesis, we will control the effect of these protagonist variables by using non- descriptive, animate same gender protagonists only and by taking care that the gender of participants matches the gender of protagonists. Yet, we will study to what extent three socio- psychological variables of participants have an effect on IC preferences: self perspective, group membership, and culture. 1.3.5 Socio-psychological explanations: self perspective, group, culture Self perspective Most linguistic IC studies are carried out in a neutral third-person perspective: participants read or complete IC sentences using proper names. Yet, it is known that people tend to make different causal attributions depending on whether they are involved themselves in the events or not (Jones & Nisbett 1971). When people are involved in events, social psychological factors such as motivations to keep a positive image of oneself and their group, would influence their attributions (e.g., Tajfel et al. 1979; Weiner 1972). Keeping a good image of oneself means that people want to be associated with positive events, while they tend to distance themselves from negative events. This is the core idea of a bias extensively studied in social psychology and linguistics, the self-serving bias (henceforth SSB). In terms of attribution, this means that compared to events of a third-person perspective, in events of a first-person perspective, people are more likely to attribute positive events to themselves, while less likely to do so in negative events (for reviews, see Malle 2006; Mezulis et al. 2004). The attribution studies most relevant to our study elicited causal attribution responses using negative and positive interpersonal implicit causality verbs and showed self-serving attribution patterns in their data (Cunningham et al. 1979; Kasof & Lee 1993; Wang et al. 21 Introduction2015; 2017; 2021). They all distinguish between three perspective roles, differing in the degree in which the self is involved in the event: the role of passive observer, when the self is not involved (a neutral perspective), and the roles of active observer and actor, when the self takes the least or most involved position, respectively. In our thesis, we will study the effect of the self perspective in a similar way, i.e., by varying different perspectives in IC sentences, thereby systematically distinguishing negative and positive IC verbs, and we will investigate to the effect of self perspective in relation to two other socio-psychological variables: group membership and culture. Group membership As to the role of group membership, there is abundant evidence that people have a need to belong to a group and want to maintain a good relationship with members in their group (e.g., Baumeister & Leary 1995). They consider others as part of their group, the ingroup, for example members of the same political party, or as part of a different group, the outgroup (Tajfel et al. 1971). When people interact with others, they are known to favor ingroup members over outgroup members, or conversely, disfavor outgroup members over ingroup members. This phenomenon is known as the intergroup bias (henceforth IGB, e.g., Tajfel & Turner 1979). The IG bias has also been found to influence language use. In a series of papers, Maass and colleagues study the influence of group membership on language use (Maass et al. 1989; 1995; 1996). They have shown that people used more abstract language terms when talking about positive ingroup and negative outgroup behaviors than negative ingroup and positive outgroup behaviors. They explain this on the basis of the group identity threat. People are more threatened by durable negative events (e.g., he hates me) than less durable ones (e.g., he shouts at me); conversely, they feel more appreciated by durable positive events (e.g., he loves me) than less durable ones (e.g., he thanks me). Abstract verbs and adjectives express more long-lasting durable events (e.g., appreciate, hate), while concrete verbs express time- constrained events (e.g., kick, run). To our knowledge, only a few studies investigated the effect of group membership on causal attributions in IC sentences (Niemi et al. 2019; Niemi et al. 2020). Niemi et al. 's (2019) study shows a massive effect of people's political preference (in this case being a democrat or a republican in the US) on how they attribute causes of positive and negative events to either their own candidate or the candidate of the other party, in the context of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections. They show that supporters tended to connect positive events more with their preferred presidential candidate, while negative events were more connected with the other candidate. In this thesis, we will investigate the effect of the intergroup bias on IC preferences in interaction with the self perspective and the cultural background of participants. Given the expected subtlety of the effect of these combined factors, we restricted the study to negative verbs, proven to be most sensitive to the self-serving bias effect. We will implement group membership by using IC sentences in two self perspectives preceded by a context in which the self and the other protagonists are introduced in an ingroup or outgroup scenario. We will ask ourselves how the IG bias interacts with the IC bias and the SS bias. If the IC bias is more influenced by the SS bias, people would be more likely to attribute negative IC 122 Chapter 1 verb sentences to the other protagonist. If the IC bias is influenced by the IG bias, people would be more likely to attribute negative IC verb sentences to themselves in case the other protagonist is an ingroup member, and they would more likely attribute causes to the other protagonist in case of an outgroup other protagonist. And again, we will include the cultural background of participants as a variable. Culture A central question in this thesis is to what extent people's cultural background influence their attribution preferences. We will focus on the difference between Eastern and Western cultures. Some researchers believe that compared to Western people, Eastern people have a weaker self-serving bias and a stronger intergroup bias, because Eastern cultures focus more on groups, while less on oneself, compared to Western cultures (e.g., Heine et al. 1999; Kitayama et al. 2009). Therefore, Eastern people would be less likely to self-enhance but more to group-enhance than Western people. In contrast, other researchers do not support the idea of cultural differences having an effect on socio-psychological biases. Instead, they believe that keeping a good image of oneself is a fundamental human motivation across cultures (e.g., Sedikides et al. 2005). When we look at IC studies, we can observe a fair consensus about the fact that implicit causality preferences are cross-linguistically quite similar. For example, Hartshorne et al. (2013) showed the IC bias as a universal phenomenon with invariant strength across cultures. They asked participants from Japan, China, and Russia to read IC verb sentences and found that largely similar IC preferences. What we do not know yet, is whether differences in the way in which cultures perceive the self and the group may influence their IC preferences. 1.3.6 Sentence structure Thus far, it is clear that implicit causality is mainly driven by semantic characteristics of verbs. Additional variables like world knowledge, polarity, protagonist variables, and psycho-social characteristics of participants may modify IC preferences. In this thesis, we also investigate the effect of a subtle syntactic variable, a characteristic of the Chinese language: the use of co-verb objects as a variant of canonical objects. In many IC studies, a canonical sentence structure has been used: subject/NP1 + verb + object/NP2, because. All other things being equal, one would expect a clear preference for the subject NP1 to be continued in the because subclause, because of a number of well-studied structural and syntactic preferences. First, there is the preference of syntactic parallelism (Sheldon 1974) predicting that subjects of a clause preferentially refer to subjects of the previous clause, objects to objects. Second, first-mentioned referents are more available for re-mention than other entities Gernsbacher & Hargreaves Finally, subjecthood affects reference resolution: Hobbs (1979) and many other researchers showed that the special status of subjects of sentences makes them more eligible as referents of upcoming pronouns than objects. Some researchers even assign agent-like properties to subjects even if subjects are not typically agents (e.g., Schlesinger 1992). 23 IntroductionThese syntactic preferences have been studied in relation to the IC bias. For example, Fukumura and van Gompel (2010) asked participants to read and complete IC verb sentences (e.g., Gary scared Anna after the long discussion ended in a row. This was because...). They analyzed whether participants referred more to the expected protagonist according to the IC bias and whether they used more pronouns relative to repeated names in the completions. Results showed that the choice of referent was driven by the implicit causality direction of the verbs, i.e., the participants indeed produced more completions about the expected protagonist than unexpected one. But the form of the referent was driven by grammatical structure, in that participants used more pronouns when referring to the NP1 protagonist than the NP2 protagonist. Because in English, the first-mentioned protagonist is also the subject, J\u00e4rvikivi, van Gompel and Hyona (2017) further analyzed whether it is the subject preference or the first-mention effect that influences the pronoun resolution in IC verb sentences. They conducted an eye-tracking experiment in which they presented pictures and spoken IC verb sentences in Finnish of two sentence structures. One was the canonical SVO sentence structure, and the other one was the OVS structure. In the sentences, order-of-mention (first, second) and grammatical role (subject, object) were two independent factors. Based on participants' percentages of looks at the two protagonists, their results showed that it was order-of-mention that influenced the IC bias, first mention causing more looks, but grammatical roles did not. These two studies together show that syntactic position can have an effect on the IC bias in that the first-mentioned protagonist is more likely to be judged as causer. This effect strengthens the bias of IC1 verb sentences, while weakens that of IC2 verb sentences. The influence of syntax on the IC bias is often studied using the variation between the active vs. passive voice, two constructions in which the semantic roles of protagonists are considered the same, while their surface positions are reversed (e.g., Rudolph & F\u00f6rsterling 1997; Brown & Fish 1983; Kasof & Lee 1993; Zhan et al. 2020). All studies confirm that changing the syntactic arrangement of the subject and object in a passive voice does not reverse the causal attribution preferences, thus again showing the verb semantic character of the IC bias. On top of this main effect, most of the studies show a stronger bias when the biased term is in subject position (Kasof & Lee 1993), though some dissonant results are found as well (e.g., Rohde & Kehler 2014). Also, it remains unclear to what extent the effect found in passive sentences can be seen as syntactic in nature only, as changing an active in a passive voice can be seen as affecting the semantic construal of a sentence (e.g., Biber et al. 1999; Zhan et al. 2020), in particular, the passive voice highlights the affected patient and thus stresses the affectedness of the patient which in turn can explain a higher patient bias in the passive voice, rather than the subject position. The influence of syntax is also studied in the field of second language acquisition. Kim and Gr\u00fcter (2019) investigated IC bias differences between two types of IC verbs different in the way they mark causality, either implicitly (using simple verbs like kill) or explicitly as in causing X to be dead. The latter construction can be used to express causal events in Korean. They found Korean participants to display a stronger NP1 bias in case of explicit causal structures, as compared to simple IC verbs expressing causality implicitly, an effect which was replicated when Korean participants were asked to complete sentences with 124 Chapter 1 two types of English verbs (verbs with a simple verb translation in Korean vs. verbs with an explicit causal construction translation). But, as in the case of active vs. passive, one can argue that the syntactic construction has clear semantic consequences, as the explicit structure clearly enhances the causal character of the verb and, therefore, can be seen as a reason to enhance the built in IC bias of the verb. Finally, the syntactic effects of the IC bias have been studied using more minimal syntactic pairs. A case in point here is the variation in Mandarin Chinese between two types of object positions, a regular object in an SVO structure (e.g., John admires Bill) and an object preceding the verb and preceded by a preposition or co-verb in an SCOV structure (e.g., John ba Bill admires). The co-verb object ba precedes the verb, and thus can be seen as an upgrade compared to the regular object. On the other hand, regular objects can be seen as having a more prominent argument position compared to the oblique position of a prepositional phrase. The two theoretical positions have been discussed widely, in particular in relation to the co-verb ba (Yang et al. 1999; 2003; Tsao 1987; Huang et al. 2009; Keenan & Comrie 1977) while the effect of co-verbs on the IC bias remains inconclusive (Zhan et al. 2020; Cheng & Almor 2017a). Therefore, we will contribute to the discussion by investigating the effect of co-verb constructions on the IC bias. 1.3.7 In conclusion Implicit causality preferences are first of all driven by semantic characteristics of the verb. Yet, many other variables are able to influence the strength of the implicit causality bias. In this thesis, we focus on how various social psychological variables influence the IC bias strength, in particular self perspective, group membership, and cultural background of participants. Apart from social psychological variables, we also study a particular syntactic factor, the use of canonical vs. co-verb objects. 1.4 Method In this thesis, we will contribute to the role of social psychological and syntactic variables on the IC bias by carrying out three production experiments asking participants to choose the most appropriate referent and to complete the IC sentence. Previous IC studies have used both comprehension and production experiments. Comprehension based IC studies used several online methods have been used to study the IC verb sentence comprehension, such as self-paced reading tasks in early online studies (e.g., Garnham et al. 1992), to eye-tracking (Cozijn et electroencephalogram (EEG) tasks (e.g., van Berkum et al. 2007) more recently. In these tasks, it has been shown that the IC bias influences sentence processing rapidly. When participants read IC verb sentences of the structure: NP1 + verb + NP2, because +pronoun + disambiguation information, before they reach the segment of disambiguation information, they already tend to look more at the expected NP than the unexpected one at the connective and pronoun segment, suggesting an early 25 Introductioneffect of the IC bias in sentence processing. If the disambiguous information refers to the unexpected NP , such as John criticized Peter, because he (John) was a mean person, readers showed a slowdown before they looked at the referent, compared to sentences in which the disambiguous information refers to the expected NP , such as John criticized Peter, because he (Peter) did something wrong. These online methods have also been used to test readers' differences in processing IC verb sentences. For example, skilled readers showed an early effect of the IC bias, whereas less skilled readers showed the effect at the end of the IC verb sentences (Long & De Ley 2000). Completing an incongruent sentence takes more time than completing a congruent sentence (Guerry et al. 2006). And proactive readers, who make long saccades and many regressions, tend to use IC bias information to anticipate referential continuation of an incomplete IC verb sentences earlier than conservative readers who make short saccades and few regressions (Koornneef & Mulders 2016). Most IC studies ask participants to show their IC preferences in production tasks, either by choosing one of two protagonists being the most adequate referent as subject of a sentence or clause following an IC main verb (referential choice task), or by judging the likelihood of the two protagonists to be the cause of the event described in the main IC sentence (rating task). A standard method to elicit the participant's referential choice is the combination of a choice and a sentence completion task (Koornneef & van Berkum 2006, Chapters 2, 3, and 4 in this thesis). In most cases, the incomplete sentences presented to participants consist of a main clause and the typical causal connective because ( NP1 + verb + NP2, because... ). This way, the connective strongly suggests the completion to describe the cause of the event presented in the main verb. Some studies also ask participants to add a new sentence after a full stop (e.g., Bott & Solstad 2014; Kehler et al. 2008). That way, participants are free to produce, and show in their completions a larger variety of discourse relations, which makes it often difficult to unambiguously determine the nature of the relation between the two sentences (Bott & Solstad 2014, p. 27). The two protagonists presented in the main clause of IC sentences can induce ambiguity when participants use anaphoric expressions in their completions. In IC production studies, different ways have been used to eliminate as much as possible anaphoric ambiguity, and thus, to determine as much as possible who the participant intends to attribute the cause of the event. One way is just to ask participants to complete a subclause starting with an ambiguous pronoun (e.g., Koornneef & van Berkum 2006). The disadvantage of this method is, however, that completions not always solve this ambiguity, as in example 7, where the completion can be interpreted as being about the NP1 or the NP2. (7) Peter congratulated John, because ... he was unhappy. A simple way to avoid ambiguity is to use human referents having a different gender, for example Mary instead of John in example 7 (e.g., Ferstl et al. 2011). As mentioned above, gender in itself affects the IC bias (e.g., Lafrance et al. 1997). Given the social psychological variables we are investigating in this thesis, mixing genders is not a suitable solution in our experiments, as we do not want to compromise the effects of variables like group 126 Chapter 1 membership and perspective with the effect of gender. Therefore, we always used same gender referents. In order to avoid ambiguity, we use a dual completion task: first, we ask participants to choose one of two options presented to them on the screen, NP1 or NP2 (choice task); second, we ask them to complete the sentence (completion task). This may make writing a bit more artificial, but it gives certainty about each participant's choice. An interesting variation for the referential choice task is that participants are asked to just fill in or choose the protagonist in an otherwise complete composed sub-clause. That way, the experimental task does not leave room for the participant to choose their own type of event to complete the sentence, nor the type of relation between the IC clause and the explanatory follow up clause. For example, Semin and Marsman (1994) provide participants with two explanations for sentences (e.g., John blamed Peter; John is the kind of person who helps people or Peter is the kind of person that is helped by people), describing traits of the protagonist who brings the event about. Other researchers use non-descript completions with non-existent words. For example, Hartshorne and his colleagues (Hartshorne 2014; Hartshorne & Snedeker 2013; Hartshorne et al. 2015) use pseudo words like dax or froom in the completions of IC verb sentences (e.g., Sally disliked Mary because she is a dax. Sally disliked Mary because she daxed). Though the influence of the content of the completion on referential choice is expected to be lower, it is still not clear how participants interpret the non-existent words. Moreover, also here, providing the completion prevents participants to indicate whether and how the main IC clause would influence the relation between the main clause and the causal completion. Most of the IC studies use sentence completions just to elicit a participant's choice for one or the other protagonist. Completions are mostly analyzed to check whether their choice is congruent with the completion. Some studies also focus on the content of completions themselves, and the relation between completions and main clauses (e.g., Bott & Solstad 2014; 2021; Kehler et al. 2008). Apart from studying completions in terms of the relation between the main IC clause and the completion clause, we also consider completions relevant in the study of the variables we are interested in. The referential choice between one of two protagonists can be seen as a major decision, as it hugely defines the content of the completion clause. We know that the semantic type of IC verbs remains the strongest determinant of the IC bias strength. Variables as the ones we are interested in are not expected to change the bias direction drastically. It is more likely that the effect of these variables at most modifies this pronoun resolution process slightly. Apart from that, there is a fair chance that the variables affect the way participants complete the sentences. An important linguistic variable here is the type of event expressed in the completion, in particular the stability of events as referring to time constrained actions (e.g., kick), durative states (e.g., hate), or stable attributes (e.g., being sad, being a soldier ). There is Hartshorne et al. (2015, p. 723) who suggest the relevance of this variable in IC preferences of preconceived completion sentences with either 'stable' nouns (she is a dax) or verbs with unspecified stability status (she daxed). Apart from that, there is ample evidence of intriguing connections between social psychological biases (self-serving bias, intergroup bias) and the production or interpretation of different stability types of events (e.g., Semin & Fiedler 1988; Maass et al. 1988). Therefore, apart from referential choice, we will carry 27 Introductionout an in-depth analysis of completions, focusing on stability and polarity and including all relevant linguistic cues that may be relevant in relation to the social psychological variables we are interested in. Referential choice tasks can be considered rather indirect ways to elicit IC preferences. Often, IC preferences have also been studied using more direct attributions of causes to protagonists. Participants can be asked to answer the question who of the two referents they think caused the events (e.g., Garvey & Caramazza 1974). Similarly, they can be asked to carry out a rating task (e.g., Brown & Fish 1983), in which they are asked to rate the likeliness of the two protagonists as causers of the event. In the former, the result is a forced choice between two referents, the latter offers a more refined answer on a scale, and also acknowledges the fact that choices are the results of a stronger or weaker bias, rather than an absolute choice. Hartshorne et al. (2013) has convincingly showed that choice tasks test linguistic knowledge and only indirectly indicate causes of events, while rating tasks test non-linguistic and social behavior knowledge. The semantic information indicated by the IC bias, such as the stimulus role of mental verbs, would be relatively prominent and stable in the process of making a linguistic referential choice in the choice task. In contrast, in the behavioral task, the participants are explicitly asked to consider event causes and make attributions. The focus is on the participants' non-linguistic knowledge, such as the social psychological motive to keep a positive self-image, the self-serving attribution tendency. Therefore, we will also include a rating test in studying the effect of self perspective and culture. In sum, this dissertation will present three studies with commonly used production methods in IC studies, because these methods allow us to directly study how psycho-social factors influence the IC bias. We focus not only on how referential choice is affected by these variables, but also the completions themselves. All studies have culture as a main between subject variable, with China representing Eastern culture, and The Netherlands Western culture. In Chapter 2, incomplete English IC verb sentences are used in both a referential choice plus sentence completion task, followed by a causal judgment task. In Chapter 3, incomplete English IC verb sentences are used in three-sentence scenarios with a referential choice task and a sentence completion task. In Chapter 4, the completions of the two studies are explored in terms of stability and polarity. Chapter 5 uses incomplete Chinese IC verb sentences in a sentence completion task, followed by a referential choice task. 1.5 Overview The aim of this dissertation is to have a better understanding of how linguistic factors interact with social psychological factors in people's causal inference in IC verb sentences. Chapter 2 investigates whether the self-serving bias influences the IC bias in both a sentence completion task and a causal judgment task. This is done by comparing IC bias strengths between sentences with a third-person perspective and two first-person (self) perspectives. The results show that compared to the third-person perspective, in the first-person perspectives, people tend to attribute negative events more to others, and (to some extent) positive events to themselves, suggesting that the self-serving bias influences the IC bias. 128 Chapter 1 Chapter 3 investigates whether context influences the IC bias by adding three contextual sentences before the IC verb sentences. In these contextual sentences, the group membership between the two protagonists is manipulated as being either ingroup or outgroup members. The results do not support an influence of the intergroup bias on the IC bias strength. Chapter 4 explores how IC verbs influence the kinds of causes that participants think of when they read the IC verb sentences. The main clauses and the completion clauses provided by the participants are separately categorized in terms of event types. The results show that stable events in the first clause tend to trigger stable completions in the second clause, suggesting a congruent relationship of event types between the two clauses. Chapter 5 focuses on how syntactic structures influence the IC bias. Incomplete IC verb sentences with two Chinese syntactic structures: the canonical subject + verb + object structure and another subject + co- verb + object structure, are presented to Chinese participants, and the IC bias strengths between the two structures are compared. The results do not support that syntactic structure influences the IC bias strength. Chapter 6 provides a general discussion of findings in the four studies, relating them to the theories of the IC bias mentioned in this introductory chapter.29 Introduction 12CHAPTER 2 The infl uence of self perspecti ve and culture on implicit causality 32 Chapter 22.1 Introduction People spontaneously tend to understand the world by making attributions for events (e.g., Duval et al. 1983; Heider 1944; Wong & Weiner 1981). In social psychology, attribution is the process by which individuals explain the causes of events. This is considered a basic human tendency (Heider 1958). While people strive to find reasons for behaviors, they fall into many traps of biases and errors. One of the biases studied in many disciplines is the self-serving bias (the SS bias). The core idea of the SS bias is that people tend to attribute positive events to themselves and negative events to others, in order to keep a positive image of themselves (see Mezulis et al. 2004, for a meta-analysis of 266 studies on the SS bias). The self-serving bias has often been studied using interpersonal verbs. Read the following sentences with a same negative interpersonal verb: (1a) John criticized Peter, because... (1b) John criticized me, because... The verb criticize is known to have an implicit causality (IC) bias towards the second noun phrase (NP2) of the sentence, i.e., Peter in sentence 1a and me in sentence 1b, which makes people tend to attribute the cause of the criticizing event to these NP2 protagonists (Caramazza et al. 1977; Garvey & Caramazza 1974, and others). However, in order to keep a positive image of themselves due to the SS bias, people tend to attribute negative events to others rather than themselves. Therefore, involving the writer or reader as the NP2 protagonist, as in sentence 1b, two conflicting forces come into play: on the one hand, there is the IC bias connected to the verb, resulting in a strong bias to consider me as the causer of the criticizing event; on the other hand, there is the tendency to push away negative events from the self, which would mitigate the tendency to consider the self NP2 as causer of the event. The results of the two conflicting forces would lead to a weaker tendency to attribute the cause of the event to the NP2 protagonist in sentence 1b than in sentence 1a. In sentences containing a positive verb, such as admire, an opposite tendency is expected. So far, to our knowledge, there has been no investigation regarding whether culture would modify the interaction between the SS bias and the IC bias. In this chapter we will use a choice task, a sentence completion task, and a rating task to investigate the SS bias effect in IC verb sentences in participants coming from Eastern and Western cultures. We use sentences with interpersonal verbs to elicit these effects. In these sentences, three variables are crucial. First, the main verb in the sentence is known to have a clear implicit causality bias. Second, the main verb expresses an event with a clear polarity direction, positive (e.g., admire) or negative (e.g., criticize). Third, the sentences are constructed in three perspective versions, the neutral perspective (IC1 verb: John amazed Peter; IC2 verb: John criticized Peter ) and two self perspectives, the biased-self perspective in which the self takes up the biased position (i.e., NP1 in IC1 verbs: I amazed Peter; NP2 in Peter criticized me) and the non-biased-self or biased-other perspective in which the self takes up the non-biased position (i.e., NP2 in IC1 verbs: John amazed me ; NP1 in IC2 verbs: I criticized Peter ).33 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalityIn the following subsections, we will first explain the SS bias by reviewing how it has been investigated in the discipline of social psychology and linguistics, and then we will discuss how culture can modulate the SS Bias effect. In section 2.2 we will present the set-up of the study, in section 2.3 the results. Section 2.4 offers the discussion. 2.1.1 SS bias in attribution studies The self-serving attribution has been studied extensively in the field of social psychology. In his classic book on dyadic interpersonal relations, Heider (1958) proposed that the attribution of causes is an important process for people to perceive each other in interaction and that people make attributions that maintain their self-image. As he acknowledged, when a person wants to avoid responsibility for failure in his life, he may \"find a good ally in fate\" and \"blame the tricks or commands in fate\" (Heider 1958, p.118). Following Heider, researchers in social psychology have studied the SS bias for decades and have shown that it is a robust phenomenon in human cognition: people tend to hold themselves responsible for positive events and avoid doing so in case of negative events. The SS bias has been shown in various contexts. For example, in the context of competitive organized sport, players have been shown to attribute personal success more to their own high ability and failure to external factors like poor weather conditions or biased officials (Allen et al. 2020, for a meta-analysis). Managers are known to attribute correct managerial decisions to their own managerial skills and wrong decisions to bad luck (Cristofaro & Giardino 2020). Voters tend to take personal responsibility for positive changes in their personal welfare and tend to hold the government responsible for negative changes (Larsen 2021). Students tend to attribute their exam success to their own intelligence and effort, while exam failure is seen as being caused by bad luck and exam difficulty (Weiner 1972; 1979; 1985; Graham 2020, for a review). Clinical researchers even showed that these self-serving tendencies are beneficial for one's mental health, in that an absent or attenuated SS bias is often associated with mental health issues, such as depression (Greenberg et al. 1992, for a meta-analysis). Social psychologists use three major dimensions along which people attribute causes of situations and events: internality, stability, and globality. Internality refers to causes being either internal to the self (e.g., one's own ability, intelligence) or external (e.g., caused by someone else, by accident) (Heider 1958). Stability refers to a cause being stable over time (Weiner 1985). Finally, globality expresses to what extent a cause extends over many different types of situations (e.g., intelligence influences a wide range of academic and job performance, but mathematical ability has a relatively limited application range) (Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale 1978). A comprehensive meta-analysis of 266 SS bias studies from Mezulis et al. (2004) showed in nearly all samples a higher preference of participants for internal, stable, and global attributions in the case of positive events, compared to negative events. In this chapter, we focus mainly on internality as explanatory dimension. Internality, also called locus of control, is an important notion originally developed by Rotter (1954) in his social learning theory. It was used by Heider (1958) to explain how people perceive each other in dyadic interpersonal relations. Locus of control is the degree to which an individual 234 Chapter 2perceiving positive or negative outcome on preceding behavior is contingent upon his own behavior and attributes (internal control) or by forces outside himself, such as luck and fate (external control) (Rotter 1966). Starting from the perspective of the self, the locus of control of a cause can be internal, i.e., the cause can be found in the self, or external, i.e., the cause is to be found in external situations or protagonists (Heider 1958). In studying the SS bias using interpersonal verbs, as we aim to do in this chapter, the crucial attribution task is to make a causal choice between one out of two protagonists typically connected to events expressed by interpersonal verbs: the self, expected to be the preferred 'internal' locus in case of positive events, and the other expected to be the preferred 'external' locus of control in case of negative events. Social psychologists have proposed different explanations why people display the SS bias. In their review of SS bias causes, Shepperd et al. (2008) distinguish motivation-driven and cognitive-driven explanations, which they consider inextricably intertwined with each other. Motivation-driven explanations consider the SS bias the result of people pursuing specific motives and intentions, in particular the motive to keep or create a positive self- image (self-enhancement, self-presentation). This motive refers to one's preference for being associated with positive events over negative events (Alicke & Sedikides 2009, for a review on self-enhancement). Holding oneself accountable for positive outcomes rather than for negative outcomes is a way to enhance the self-image, because it helps to maximize people's virtues (Campbell & Sedikides 1999). Cognitive-driven explanations assume that self-serving attributions result from people not only intending to keep a positive self-image, but also trying to objectively evaluate the available objective evidence, two tendencies which not necessarily produce converging forces. People learn about themselves by making attributions about their own behavior and circumstances in which the behavior occurs, as much as they learn about others (Bem 1967; 1972). In the process of evaluating themselves, on the one hand, they want to acquire accurate information about themselves, such as their abilities, by considering objective evidence in the circumstances when making attributions (Duval & Silvia 2002), e.g., whether students achieve academic outcomes above or below an average level. In addition, people tend to connect themselves with positive events more than with negative events (Miller & Ross 1975). For example, students expect themselves to achieve positive academic outcomes. Negative event outcomes are inconsistent with expectations and elicit higher surprise than positive outcomes, especially when the consequences of the outcomes are serious (Gendolla & Koller 2001). One way to justify their engagement in the events, e.g., their efforts spent on exams, is to attribute the negative outcomes to external causes. They do not tend to attribute negative outcomes to their own abilities and efforts, because these internal causes are often reasons for them to hold positive expectations in the first place (e.g., Libby & Rennekamp 2012; Gilmor & Minton 1974). As said, Shepperd et al. (2008) consider the two explanations inextricably intertwined, as the two explanations indicate the importance of a good self-image in why people make self-serving attributions. The fact that people generally hold positive expectations about their abilities and efforts in the first place may indicate a motivational reason: people generally feel good about themselves. On the other hand, the cognitive-driven explanations stress that the evaluation of objective evidence is a necessary step in making self-serving attributions and maintaining a positive self-image.35 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalityIn the introduction chapter of his classic book, Heider (1958) mentioned the importance of using \"language as conceptual tool\". He claimed that language \"contains a great number of general concepts that symbolize experiences with the physical and social environment.\" (p.7). He also mentioned that it is crucial that interpersonal relations can be indicated by language, in particular transitive verbs, thus predicting an important role for interpersonal verbs in studying the SS bias. He discussed the causal structure of four 'transaction-from- property' verbs: give (A gives something to B), take (A takes something from B), receive (A receives something from B) and keep (A keeps something from B). He considered the B (NP2) protagonist as the causal source of the action of receive, and the A (NP1) protagonist as the cause of the action of give, take , and keep. Similar to these transfer verbs, implicit causality verbs used in this chapter give readers an indication about which protagonist should be the causer. For example, the IC2 negative verb sentence (1a) John criticized Peter , suggests that the NP2 protagonist Peter should be the causer of the criticizing event. When people read the sentence (1b) John criticized me , they evaluate the evidence that the event should be attributed to the NP2 protagonist, themselves in this case. Social psychologists have mostly investigated the SS bias by asking participants to make explicit judgments on positive and negative events. Two methods are widely used by social psychologists. Especially in explaining achievement-related activities, such as passing an exam (e.g., Frieze & Weiner 1971; Weiner et al. 1972), participants are asked to make attributions among four causes: their ability, effort, task difficulty, and luck. A major focus has been on the study of attribution patterns associated to ability in relation to success and failure, because ability has been considered as the most internal, stable, and global cause (Sweeney et al. 1986, for a meta-analysis on these four causes). Another widely used method is to ask participants to list the most important cause of a scenario, and rate the cause in terms of internality, stability, and globality. This method is not limited to the cause of ability, the most important cause in the motivation studies (Abramson et al. 1978). A popular measure in this method is the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ; Peterson et al. 1982; Peterson & Villanova 1988) and its adaptations (e.g., Children's Attributional Style Questionnaire, Seligman Questionnaire-revised, Thompson et al.1998). In the ASQ, participants are presented with a series of one-sentence hypothetical positive or negative scenarios starting from their own perspective (e.g., You meet a friend who acts hostilely towards you/compliments you ; You successfully/unsuccessfully apply for a position ). For each scenario, the participants are asked to write down a major cause they think of, and to rate on 7-point scales how likely the cause is due to themselves. Results of studies using the ASQ showed that in positive scenarios, participants tend to provide a cause that they rated more likely due to themselves than in the negative scenarios (Peterson et al. 1982; Mezulis et al. 2004). In sum, social psychologists mainly asked participants to directly and explicitly attribute causes of events presented to them. In this chapter, we used a similar behavioral measurement task and asked participant to rate the likeliness of the two protagonists as causers of the event described by the verb. Apart from that, we also used more implicit, linguistic tasks to elicit causal attributions, and asked participants to choose the most appropriate protagonist for continuing the sentence, and then to complete the sentence. 236 Chapter 2That way, we expect to see that the expected implicit causality effect be modified when the self takes up one of the protagonist positions in positive and negative sentences. 2.1.2 SS bias and IC bias The attribution studies most relevant to our study elicited causal attribution responses using negative and positive interpersonal implicit causality verbs and showed self-serving attribution patterns in their data (Cunningham et al. 1979; Kasof & Lee 1993; Wang et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2021). They all distinguish between three perspective roles, differing in the degree in which the self is involved in the event: the role of passive observer, when the self is not involved (the neutral perspective), and the roles of active observer and actor, when the self takes the least or most involved position, respectively. As we will see, the latter two roles are defined differently in the studies below, either in terms of syntax (NP1 being more prominent than NP2) or in terms of thematic roles (agents and stimuli being more prominent than patients and experiencers). In the literature on perspective taking, perspective is often defined as taking another person's perspective, for example, to step into the shoes of the other and understand thoughts or feelings of that person (e.g., Hall et al. 2021, for a recent review on perspective- taking). In our case, perspective refers to whether and how the self (the reader) is involved in a dyadic interpersonal event. In particular, when the self is involved as a protagonist in the dyadic event, the self is interacting with the other protagonist and views the action or experiences the interaction as one of the protagonists. Linguistically, this can simply be done by including the self as one of the two argument positions (NP1 I kissed Peter or NP2 Peter kissed me) of the interpersonal verb. When people are not involved in the event, they merely observe the interaction between two protagonists in the event. They view the event as an onlooker, a perspective linguistically realized as with proper names as NP1 and NP2, henceforth called the neutral perspective. The IC studies mentioned above use these perspective manipulations to display the SS bias effect. They use IC verb sentences in either a rating task or a choice task and compare participants' rating or choice between the self and the neutral perspectives in positive and negative IC verb sentences. In the studies we are interested in, the general outcome is a consistent SS bias effect in negative IC verb sentences in the two tasks, while for positive IC verb sentences, the SS bias effect only appeared in the rating task, and not in the choice task. The first study, Cunningham et al. (1979) used a rating task to show that the SS bias influences causal attribution of events described by IC verb sentences. The study aimed at testing the actor-observer asymmetry, i.e., the idea that participants judge causes of events differently based on their involvement or perspective as actor, active, or passive observer in hypothetical emotional interpersonal events. The source of this idea comes from Jones and Nisbett (1971) who claimed that \"there is a pervasive tendency for actors to attribute their actions to situational requirements, whereas observers tend to attribute the same actions to stable personal dispositions\" (p. 80). In other words, when people take the perspective of an actor, they tend to base their own behavior on external causes; when they take the perspective of an observer, they tend to base their attribution to the actor's 37 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalityinternal causes. As a complement to this idea, Cunningham et al. focused on distinguishing two types of observers, taken from Miller and Norman (1975), that observers would make different causal attributions, depending on whether they are actively observing the event (active observer, e.g., John hates me) or passively (passive observer, e.g., John hates Paul ). An active observer not only just observes the actor's behavior, like a passive observer does, but also influences the actor's behavior and is influenced by the actor's behavior (Miller & Norman 1975; Nesdale & Moore 1984). So, Cunningham et al. had different expectations about these two observer roles. Cunningham et al. (1979) manipulated valence and perspective in only four experiencer- stimulus (ES) IC2 mental verb pairs (like-dislike, admire-resent, love-hate, and trust-distrust). They distinguished three participant perspectives, thereby using the second person pronoun (you ) to implement the self perspective: the role of actor (You like Ted), the role of active observer (Ted likes you ), and two versions for the role of passive observer (Ted likes Paul and Paul likes Ted). They considered subjects as actors, and objects as active observers. For each sentence version, participants were asked to rate the likeliness of three causes on a 9-point scale. Two of the causes referred to the two protagonists involved (e.g., Ted is the kind of person that likes people, and You are the kind of person that people like ), and the third cause referred to other causes (some other reason). The results for negative events supported the active observer and the passive observer difference: attributions to the active observer were less likely than to the passive observer. The attributions to the self either as actor or as active observer were lowest of all means. Yet, it was unclear whether attributions to the actor or the active observers differed; Cunningham et al. (1979) never aimed at testing the difference between the actor and active observer. Also, they observed a clear difference between positive and negative sentences: participants were much more reluctant to attribute causality to the self in negative verb sentences than in positive verb sentences. Together, these results showed that in negative IC verb sentences, actor and active observers were judged less causal than passive observers. However, this was not the case in positive IC verb sentences. Attributions to the self in positive sentences, either as actor or active observer, were not different from those to the passive observer. These findings suggest that when people are asked explicitly to make causal judgements of events described by the IC verb sentences at a behavioral level, the SS bias exerts an influence in negative events but not in positive events. In sum, Cunningham et al. (1979) found a valence effect when the participants were asked to attribute causes to negative events in which they were involved as actor or active observer: when involved as actor or active observer in a negative event, they were less likely to attribute causes to themselves, compared to when they were not involved. Yet, their results were unclear whether attributions to the self-protagonist differed between actor and active observer in a negative event. Also, it is striking is that the participants apparently were not more likely to attribute a positive event to themselves, as the SS bias would predict. Furthermore, the results do not address the issue, as explained above, of whether a similar effect shows up in a less explicit task, when people are asked to perform a more implicit, linguistic task such as completing IC verb sentences as we use in this chapter. In addition, in Cunningham et al. 's study, the actor and active observer roles coincided with the subject 238 Chapter 2and object positions in the sentences, respectively. Yet, the four verb pairs they used were IC2 experiencer-stimulus (ES) mental verb pairs. It has been shown that the thematic role of the stimulus of mental verbs, i.e., the NP2 protagonist in the object position of like-dislike sentences, is more likely to be rated as the causer of events described by the verbs than the thematic role of experiencer, i.e., the NP1 protagonist in the subject position (Brown & Fish 1983). This raises the question how the semantic notion of thematic roles plays out in attributing causes to the two protagonists in IC verb sentences under the influence of the SS bias. A study dealing with this issue is Kasof and Lee (1993). Kasof and Lee (1993) replicated and expanded the rating experiment from Cunningham et al. (1979) with a focus on the influence of perspectives and thematic roles on the IC bias. Though they do not explicitly have expectations about valence and the SS bias, their materials are balanced over positive and negative events. In their view, interpersonal events described by the IC verbs evoke mental representations in which the two protagonists differ in salience. They claim that readers tend to attribute more causality to the more salient protagonist compared to the less salient one. They see thematic roles as the most important factor influencing the protagonist's salience. For action verbs, the agent is more salient than the patient and for mental verbs, the stimulus is more salient than the experiencer. Therefore, irrespective of perspective, people tend to attribute the causes for IC verb events to the agent/stimulus more than to the patient/experiencer. According to Kasof and Lee (1993), a thematic role can be implemented in a neutral ('passive observer') perspective (John loves Paul ), or in one of two self perspectives: the actor perspective, implemented as NP1-agent in action IC1 verbs (I hit Paul ), as NP1-stimulus in SE/IC1 annoy Paul ), and as NP2-stimulus in ES/IC2 verbs (Paul loves me ); the other is the active observer perspective, implemented as NP2 patient, NP2 or NP1 experiencer respectively. They claim that most studies presented sentences in either the passive observer perspective or the active observer perspective, but not in the actor perspective. Since actors most often represent agents/stimuli and observers most often represent patients/ experiencers, agents/stimuli are more salient than patients/experiencers. Kasof and Lee (1993) claimed that compared to the observer perspectives, an actor perspective results in a weaker IC bias for the agent or the stimulus role, regardless of valence, and that the relatively salient agent/stimulus role shows up more strongly by default in observer perspectives, the passive observer, or the active observer perspective. Once the IC sentence is depicted from the actor perspective (i.e., readers take the agent role in action verbs, the stimulus NP1 role in SE/IC1 verbs or NP2 role ES/ IC2 verbs), the experiencer/patient role becomes more salient and thus more likely will be attributed the cause. In that case, the IC bias for the agent/stimulus role would be weaker. Different from Cunningham et al. (1979) in which actor and active observer are considered as the protagonists in the subject and the object positions respectively, Kasof and Lee believe that actor and active observer should be implemented according to thematic role: actors should be implemented as the agent role in action verbs and the stimulus role in mental verbs, and active observers should be implemented as the patient role in action verbs and the experiencer role in mental verbs. Therefore, Kasof and Lee hypothesized that when people themselves take the actor position as agent or stimulus, they are more likely to 39 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalityattribute causes to the other protagonist, compared to the other perspectives. Kasof and Lee (1993) presented eight agent-patient equally divided over positive and negative verbs. In their first study, they asked participants to read the IC verb sentences in the neutral perspective, and to rate how salient the two protagonists in the sentences would be on 9-point scales. In the second study, similar to Cunningham et al. (1979), they tested the IC verb sentences in the three perspectives. They asked participants explicitly to rate the likelihood of the same three causes as in Cunningham et al. (1979). Two of the causes referred to the two protagonists involved (e.g., Ted is the kind of person that likes people, and You are the kind of person that people like), and the third cause referred to other causes (some other reason). The results of the first study confirmed the salience theory they proposed: the salience ratings of the agent and the stimulus roles were higher than those of the patient and the experiencer roles in the neutral perspective. The results of the second study showed that when the participants took the agent/stimulus roles as the actors, they attributed less causality to the self-protagonist, compared to when they took the active and the passive observer roles. This means that Kasof and Lee (1993) found attribution differences between actor and active observers. This is different from the results of Cunningham et al. (1979), in which it was unclear whether there are attribution differences between actor and active observers. More important for our study is that Kasof and Lee (1993) also noticed a self-serving tendency in the results: participants attributed greater causality to the self-protagonist in positive sentences and attributed greater causality to the other protagonist in negative sentences, regardless of whether they took the actor or the active observer role. In sum, they found a strong valence effect in relation to perspective, while Cunningham et al. (1979) found the effect only in negative sentences. Because Kasof and Lee used a rating task, just like Cunningham et al. (1979), it remains an open question whether a similar effect can be found in less explicit, linguistic attribution tasks. In a more recent series of studies, Wang and his colleagues used positive and negative Chinese IC verbs in the three perspectives, aiming to show the effect of the SS bias in IC verb sentences (Wang et al. 2017) and to investigate the neural mechanism of the SS bias effect in relation to actor and active observer roles (Wang et al. 2015; 2021). They used a rating task in Wang et al. (2015; 2021) and a referential choice task in Wang et al. (2017). In the latter study, they asked Chinese participants to read 20 positive and 20 negative Chinese IC verb sentences, equally divided over IC1 and IC2 verbs. As in Cunningham et al. (1979), Wang et al. (2017) considered the actor and active observers (which they call recipient) to coincide with their syntactic positions in the IC verb sentences. Like Kasof and Lee, they used the first-person pronoun (I or me) to implement the self perspectives. This resulted in sentences with a self as NP1 perspective in which the participants were the actor (I hit YangMing ), NP2 as self perspective in which the participants were the active observer (YangMing hit me ), and a neutral perspective in which the participants were the passive observer (YangMing hit Wangshan ). In the rating task (Wang et al. 2015; 2021), participants were asked to read the sentences and to rate the two self perspectives on a 4-point scale (How likely is it that I/ YangMing or Wangshan am/is that kind of person). In the choice task (Wang et 240 Chapter 2al. 2017), participants were asked to read the same sentences and to choose one of the two protagonists as subject of the subordinate because-clause (i.e., because ____am/is that kind of person) . Additionally, in both tasks, participants' reading times were recorded. The results largely confirmed the effect of the SS bias. In the negative sentences, rating scores of the self as the causer were lower than those of the other protagonist, while the opposite pattern was seen in the positive sentences (Wang et al. 2015; 2021). Also, in the negative sentences, participants chose less often the self in the self perspectives, compared to the protagonist in the same syntactic position in the neutral perspective. However, there was no opposite pattern found in the positive sentences (Wang et al. 2017). In addition, Wang et al. found that the SS bias was larger in the subject position, compared to the object position in both the rating and the choice tasks. This is different from Kasof and Lee (1993) where the SS bias was found to be greater in the agent/stimulus roles than in the patient/ experiencer roles: compared to when participants took the role of patient/experiencer, when they took the agent/stimulus roles, they tended to rate the other protagonist more likely as the causer of the negative IC verb sentences and to rate themselves more likely as the causer of the positive IC verb sentences. Though their data do not allow a clear comparison between the SSB effect in relation to syntactic position (subject vs. object), the self in biased object-stimulus position in ES verbs does not show a stronger SSB effect than the self in biased subject-stimulus position in SE verbs (Kasof & Lee 1993, figure 3 and 4). A point of critique is that in their choice task, Wang et al. (2017), provided the cause, i.e., being that kind of person, which may influence the referential choice. In that sense, their choice task was not a purely linguistic task, since it involved two processing steps (as suggested by the longer mean reaction time for the choice task as compared to the rating task): participants first resolved the referent, which is a linguistic decision, and then re-evaluated their choice based on the cause that was provided. The second step may have caused the participants to overrule their first decision. In this chapter, we use both a rating task and a referential choice task, and we ask participants to choose their own completion. In this way, we do not influence or guide the participants' decision with a pre-specified cause. To sum up, the findings of the IC studies above suggest an effect of the SS bias on the IC verb sentences. Yet, different effects on negative and positive IC verb sentences were found, depending on the type of task, behavioral or linguistic. In negative IC verb sentences, all the IC studies with either a rating task (Cunningham et al. 1979; Kasof and Lee 1993; Wang et al. 2015; 2021) or a choice task (Wang et al. 2017) showed an effect of the SS bias. In negative verb sentences, compared to the neutral and the non-biased-self perspectives, people are less likely to attribute the cause for the verb event to themselves, which results in the following hypotheses. H1 In negative sentences, participants in the biased-self perspectives are expected to choose themselves less often (a), and rate themselves lower (b), compared to the neutral (i) and non-biased-self (ii) perspectives. As for the positive sentences, the results of these studies are inconclusive and showed different results for the choice task and the rating task. Wang et al. (2017) did not find that people were more likely to attribute the positive IC verb sentences to themselves in their 41 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalitychoice task. On the other hand, Wang et al. (2015; 2021) and Kasof and Lee (1993) did find an effect in the rating task. Cunningham et al. (1979) did not find the effect in positive IC verb sentences in their rating task either, but because they only used four IC2 verb pairs, their study was less reliable and less comprehensive than that of Kasof and Lee, who replicated their experiment with a larger number of verbs. Because Wang et al. (2015; 2021) and Kasof and Lee (1993) found that people tended to rate themselves more likely as the causer of the positive IC verb sentences than the neutral and non-biased-self perspectives, we formulate the following hypothesis, knowing that H2b is more supported by previous work than H2a: H2 In positive sentences, participants in the biased-self perspective are expected to choose themselves more often (a), and rate themselves higher (b), compared to the neutral (i) and non-biased-self (ii) perspectives. 2.1.3 SS bias and Culture Culture is a difficult term to define. Many researchers have given different definitions of culture. For example, a classic culture study defines culture as \"a pattern of shared attitudes, beliefs, categorizations, self-definitions, norms, role definitions, and values that is organized around a theme that can be identified among those who speak a particular language, during a specific historic period, and in a definable geographic region\" (Triandis 1996, p. 408). An important notion indicated in this definition and in many other culture studies is how people perceive themselves and how they believe other members of their culture perceive them. This is the notion of self: what makes an individual a successful member of a culture. In a review of studies on the self in the psychological domain, Baumeister (2010) distinguishes three sources of selfhood: self-perception (self-awareness), interpersonal perception (self in relation to others), and the self resulting from behavior. These three sources of selfhood explain that \"the self is an essential part of the interface between the animal body and the social system\" (Baumeister 2010, p. 139). These three sources of selfhood provide answers to the universal questions of Who or what am I?, How do I relate to others? and What should I be doing? (Kitayama & Uchida 2005; Markus & Hamedani 2007). Among these three sources of selfhood, the first two sources are bases for a in categorizing cultures: individualism-collectivism (Hofstede 1980; 2001; Triandis 1995). The key assumption of this dimension is that individualistic cultures emphasize an individual as an autonomous, independent person, while collectivistic cultures emphasize the connection with others (Triandis 1995). A plausible consequence of focusing on the individual as an independent person in individualistic cultures is that people from the individualistic cultures focus more on keeping a positive sense of the self and place more value on personal success, compared to people from collectivistic cultures (Markus & Kitayama 1991). Eastern cultures are believed to be collectivistic cultures and Western cultures are believed to be individualistic cultures (Hofstede 1980; Markus & Kitayama 1991). This means that Western cultures emphasize more on keeping a positive sense of self and personal success than Eastern cultures, which could lead to a stronger SS bias in Western cultures, compared to Eastern cultures. This cross-cultural difference in the SS bias has been shown in two meta-analyses. Heine and Hamamura (2007) showed that across 91 cross-cultural 242 Chapter 2comparison studies, Western people revealed a clear SS bias, while Eastern people did not. Another meta-analysis from Mezulis et al. (2004) also showed that Eastern people showed a smaller SS bias than Western people. Based on these meta-analyses, in this chapter, we expect that Western people might show a stronger SS bias than Eastern people. Cross-cultural studies on the SS bias mostly investigate how people from Eastern and Western cultures differ in making behavioral judgments. For example, participants are asked to estimate whether their successes or failures in a task, such as a memory task, were due to their own abilities, efforts, luck, or task difficulty (Kashima & Triandis 1986). They found that the American participants were more likely to attribute successes to their abilities than failures, compared to Japanese participants, suggesting a stronger SS bias among Western people than Eastern people. Yet, cultural differences on the SS bias can be studied using more subtle and indirect linguistic tasks as well. Hartshorne et al. (2013) used IC mental verbs to test whether the IC bias is universal across cultures. They asked people from Russia, Japan, China, and America to carry out a referential choice task: they read sentences with an IC main verb (e.g., Susan frightened Mary, because she is a dax) and to choose between the two protagonists who the dax was. The novel word dax was used to ensure that participants would assign causes based on the IC verb, rather than on the (meaningless) completion of the sentence. Results showed that there is a clear bias consistent across languages and cultures that people tended to choose the stimulus role (Susan in the example sentence) as the referent across these four languages. Yet, Hartshorne et al. (2013) used sentences in the neutral perspective, thus not involving the self as one of the protagonists, so it is unclear whether the IC bias strength would remain the same between Eastern and Western cultures when readers themselves are involved as one of the two protagonists. In this chapter, we investigate how the SS bias influences the IC bias strength at both a behavioral level and a linguistic level between Western and Eastern cultures. We expect Western people would have a stronger SS bias on the IC verb sentences, compared to Eastern people, and that the culture effect is more likely to appear in a behavioral task than in a linguistic task, i.e., choosing one out of two referents, which we consider to be less explicit than directly rating causes. Hartshorne et al. (2013) has convincingly shown that choice tasks test linguistic knowledge and only indirectly indicate causes of events, while rating tasks address non-linguistic, social behavior knowledge more directly. The semantic information indicated by the IC bias, such as the stimulus role of mental verbs, would be relatively prominent and stable in the process of making a linguistic referential choice in the choice task. In contrast, in the behavioral task, the participants are explicitly asked to consider event causes and make attributions. The focus is on the participants' non-linguistic knowledge, such as the social psychological motive to keep a positive self-image, the self-serving attribution tendency. Therefore, a motive in line with the SS bias would be more prominent in a behavioral task than in a linguistic task. In cross-cultural studies on the SS bias, very often Chinese and Japanese people are taken as representatives of Eastern cultures, and European and American people as representatives of Western cultures (Oyserman et al. 2002). Although nationality may be only a proxy of culture, it is widely accepted as a reliable way to measure cross-cultural 43 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalitydifferences in social psychological studies in general, and in studying the SS bias in particular. For example, in the meta-analysis of Heine and Hamamura (2007) as mentioned above, researchers of 91 cross-cultural studies took people from Eastern Asian countries as Eastern representatives and people from European and North American countries as Western representatives. They asked them to evaluate themselves in self-reporting measures, and showed a clear self-serving bias among Western representatives while no such bias was found among Eastern representatives. Yet, in addition to the criterion of nationality, we also use culture adherence questions as an additional check, asking participants to indicate to what extent they adhere to their own culture. In this chapter, we ask Chinese and Dutch people to read IC verb sentences and to carry out three tasks: a referential choice task, a sentence completion task, and a rating task. We investigate whether people's cultural background might influence their attributions in the IC sentences. Given the argumentation above, we formulate the following hypotheses: H3 In negative sentences, Dutch participants, as compared to Chinese participants choose less often themselves in biased position than the other protagonist (H3a) and rate themselves in biased position lower than the other protagonist (H3b). H4 In positive sentences, Dutch participants, as compared to Chinese participants choose themselves in biased position more often than the other protagonist (H4a) and rate themselves in biased position higher than the other protagonist (H4b). 2.1.4 The present study In this chapter we investigate how the SS bias and the IC bias interact at both a behavioral and a linguistic level, and whether culture modifies the interaction. To address these questions, we investigate how Dutch and Chinese people make self-serving attributions in negative and positive IC verb sentences. We conducted an experiment in which Dutch and Chinese participants were presented with incomplete positive and negative IC1 and IC2 verb sentences in a neutral perspective and in two self perspective versions: biased-self (i.e., NP1 244 Chapter 2Table 2.1 Hypotheses illustrated with examples: The expected effects of perspective (biased-self vs non-biased-self/neutral) and culture (Chinese vs. Dutch) on bias strength and causal rating of the biased protagonist (higher vs. lower). Left: biased- self (i.e., Above: the effects on negative NP2-verb Negative criticized me John irritated me/Peter I/Peter criticized John H1 - SSB lower IC bias and rating higher IC bias and rating H3 - Culture stronger effect for Dutch participants stronger effect for Dutch participants Positive verbs I amazed John John admired me John amazed me/Peter I/Peter admired John H2 - SSB higher IC bias and rating lower IC bias and rating H4 - Culture stronger effect for Dutch participants stronger effect for Dutch participants Table 2.1 shows the hypotheses illustrated with example verbs. In the neutral condition, people tend to provide causal explanations about the biased protagonist (NP1 in irritate/ amaze, NP2 in criticize/admire ), congruent with the IC1 and IC2 bias, respectively. When the self takes up the biased position (biased-self condition), however, we expect to see changes in this tendency, in that in negative sentences the IC bias strength and causal rating is expected to be weaker, compared to the neutral perspective and to the self condition in which the other protagonist takes up the biased position (non-biased-self). The opposite is expected to happen in positive sentences: higher bias strength and rating when the self takes the biased position. Thus, under the influence of the self-serving bias, participants are expected to choose themselves less often and rate themselves lower in case of negative events, and choose themselves more often and rate themselves higher in case of positive events. When the other protagonist takes the biased position, the opposite pattern is expected. The participants were asked to make causal attributions of these sentences in three tasks: a choice task in which they have to choose one of the two protagonists as the likely causer of the event, a completion task in which they completed the sentences based on their choice in a completion task, and a rating task in which they had to rate the likelihood of the two protagonists being the causers. The results of the completion task will be taken up in Chapter 4. 2.2 Method In order to test the hypotheses, we used both a choice task and a rating task, using 40 verbs (20 IC1 and 20 IC2, 20 positive and 20 negative). Each of the verbs were used in three perspectives: biased-self (i.e., subject position ' I' in position ' me' in subject position ' object position ' me' in IC1 verbs); neutral perspective (i.e., two proper names in subject and object position). We presented Chinese and Dutch participants with 40 items, each verb in one of the three perspective conditions. We also added a cultural adherence rating task to rate to what extent the participants adhered to their culture.45 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalityThis results in a 3*2*2 design, with two within-subjective variables: Perspective (biased-self, non-biased-self, neutral) and Valence (negative, positive), and one between- subject variable, Culture (Dutch, Chinese). 2.2.1 Participants 162 students from Tilburg University in the Netherlands participated in the experiment; 78 of them were Dutch students with Dutch as their native language (mean age = 21.26, SD = 2.67, 28 males and 50 females), 84 of them were Chinese students with Mandarin Chinese as their native language (mean age = 25.05, SD = 3.68, 29 males and 55 females). All participants were in an English-taught bachelor or master program at Tilburg University. They were offered the option to be paid with 5 euros or to be given one participants' pool credit for their participation. 2.2.2 Materials We selected 20 positive and 20 negative IC verbs balanced in IC bias direction. These 40 verbs were used to construct 120 sentences with each verb used in three perspectives. Verb bias and valence . The 40 English verbs were selected from a list of 300 English interpersonal verbs studied in Ferstl et al. (2011) (https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-010- 0023-2), thereby using implicit bias strength and word frequency as main criteria.. The list collects biased verbs used in earlier implicit causality studies (e.g., Brown & Fish 1983; Au 1986; Crinean & Garnham 2006). For each verb, information is available about word valence and bias score. Firstly, we selected 91 verbs (47 NP1 and 44 NP2) with a bias and valence strength of 75% or higher. Secondly, frequencies of these 91 verbs were checked in the Corpus of Contemporary American English (https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/). This corpus contains more than 560 million words from the period 1990-2017 and is equally divided among spoken, fiction, popular magazines, newspapers, and academic texts. We selected the verbs with the highest frequency from that corpus, resulting in 74 verbs. Thirdly, among these 74 verbs, 40 verbs were selected in such a way that half of them were IC1 verbs and the other half of them were IC2 verbs, and that half of the IC1 and IC2 verbs were positive and the other half of them were negative. One-way ANOVA tests showed that the four groups of verbs were not significantly different in terms of verb log frequencies, p = .53. As we asked participants to use English rather than their native language, we constructed for each verb a dictionary explanation, taken from the Cambridge English Dictionary (https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ ). Perspective . Each of the 40 verbs was used to construct three perspective conditions, resulting in 120 IC verb sentences in total. Each sentence consisted of a main clause of the structure NP1 + verb + NP2, followed by the start of a sub-clause (because). For each verb, this structure was implemented in a neutral perspective (IC1: Peter amazed John; IC2: John criticized Peter), and two self perspectives: biased-self (IC1: I amazed John; IC2: John and non-biased-self (IC1: Peter amazed me; IC2: I criticized Peter). For each sentence, two gender versions were constructed, using common female or male English names (e.g., Mary criticized Susan; Peter criticized John). The 120 sentences were distributed into three lists. Each list contained each verb in one of the three perspectives. The sentences in a list were balanced in terms of the three perspectives. The sentence order within each list was randomized. The participants were randomly assigned to one of the three lists, and they received a version corresponding to their gender to avoid a tendency to attribute events to a male protagonist compared to a female protagonist (Ferstl et al. 2011; Lafrance et al. 1997). For the rating task, the participants received the same list of incomplete sentences in another random order. 2.2.3 Instrumentation Choice task The questionnaire assessed the participants' choice percentages of the two protagonists in the IC verb sentences. In the choice task, each sentence was presented on the screen with two buttons below, one for each protagonist. The participants were required to push one of the buttons, after which the corresponding pronoun appeared in the sentence below. In the choice task, the choice percentages were obtained by the participants' choice of either the NP1 or the NP2 protagonist for each sentence. See Figure 2.1 for an example of the choice and completion task. Figure 2.1 Screenshot of example of a choice and completion item Completion task In the completion task, the participants' completions for each IC verb sentence were obtained. Each sentence was presented with a pronoun choice they made in the choice task. The participants completed the sentences based on the pronoun. The analysis of the completions will be taken up in Chapter 4. Rating task The rating task assessed the participants' rating scores of the two protagonists with the same incomplete sentences. For each sentence, a slider bar was presented with the NP1 47 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalityand NP2 protagonists on the left and right side of the slider bar, respectively. The slider was on the middle position of a slider bar by default. The rating scores were based on the participants' slider position for each sentence. Figure 2.2 Screenshot of example of a rating item Verb polarity test We used a seven-point scale (-3, -2, -1, neutral, +1, +2, +3) to test the participants' assessment of the polarity of verbs, so as to check whether there are cultural differences in the way participants assess the polarity of the verb. Paired T-test did not show that these two cultural groups evaluated valence of these verbs differently, p = 0.83. Verb definition As participants were not native speakers of English, we developed linguistic help in the form of a dictionary information for each verb (https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/ english/) . When participants hovered the mouse over the verb, a screen appeared with the dictionary definition, as illustrated in Figure 2.3. After they finished the two tasks, they could click the next button to proceed. Figure 2.3 Screenshot of example of a dictionary verb definition 248 Chapter 2Translation question We used a five-point scale (never, hardly ever, sometimes, often, always) to check the extent to which participants automatically translated the incomplete sentences in their own language. The results show that both Chinese and Dutch participants translated the sentences sometimes to often in their native languages and that they did not differ significantly on this point, p = 0.17. Culture adherence questions Four questions using a four-point scale (not at all, a little, quite a bit, very much) were used to measure the cultural adherence of the participants: How much are Chinese/Dutch values a part of your life? How proud are you being Chinese/Dutch? How much do you enjoy speaking Chinese/Dutch? Do you think Chinese/Dutch are kind and generous? The questions were taken from a validated cultural adherence questionnaire (Mezzich et al. 2009). The questionnaire consists of questions describing various culture indicators such as language, food, and holiday and has been validated in Western cultures. The cultural adherence score is the mean of these four questions. 2.2.4 Procedure We used Qualtrics for the experiment, an online survey tool (https://www.qualtrics.com/). Once the participants started the survey, a consent form appeared first. After they clicked an agree button on the consent form, an introduction of the whole experiment appeared, followed by demographic questions (age, gender, native language, education level, English language proficiency). At the next screen, an instruction of the choice task was presented. The participants were told that they would read incomplete sentences one by one. For each sentence, there would be two buttons below, one for each protagonist. They were asked to complete the sentence by clicking a button (the choice task) after which a pronoun (I or s/he ) would appear in the sentence below, followed by a text field where they were asked to complete the sentence (the completion task) according to their protagonist choice (see Figure 2.1). An example of an incomplete sentence of a neutral verb was shown, along with two possible completions referring to the NP1 and the NP2 respectively. The participants were also told that if they read a sentence involving I or me as one of the two protagonists, they should imagine that they were in the scenario described by the sentence. They were also told about the verb definition help, which they could use by hovering over the verb on the screen. After the participants read the instruction, they clicked a button to start the first incomplete sentence. After the participants completed the 40 sentences, an instruction of the rating task was shown on the screen, telling them they would be shown the same incomplete sentences again, followed by a slider bar (see Figure 2.2). The participants were instructed to move the slider towards the protagonist they thought caused the event. The more likely they thought one protagonist caused the event, the more they would move the slider towards the end of that protagonist. After the instruction, they clicked a next button to start the first sentence of this task. Once the participants finished rating the first sentence, they clicked a 49 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalitynext button to read a next one. After the rating task, we asked participants to rate the polarity of each verb on a seven-point scale. After that, we asked them how often they automatically translated the incomplete sentences in their own language. Finally, we presented them with the cultural adherence questions. The whole experiment lasted around 30 minutes. 2.2.5 Data analysis Data was collected from 162 participants, resulting in 6480 cases in the choice task and the rating task respectively. Data exclusion From these, we excluded the data of 20 participants (N = 800) because of three reasons: nine participants (5.6%) had a standard deviation of zero in the choice and the rating task scores, indicating that they had given the same choice or rating to every sentence. Another eight participants (4.9%) showed overall mean scores beyond three standard deviations of the overall mean scores of the tasks, meaning they gave largely the same answer irrespective of polarity or type of verb. Thirdly, three participants (1.9%) had a discrepancy between the choice tasks and the rating task larger than three standard deviations from the mean number of discrepancies of the participants. The remaining 5680 sentences were used in the statistical analysis in this chapter. Statistical analysis The IC bias scores were obtained by participants' choice of either the NP1 or the NP2 protagonist for each incomplete sentence, and their rating scores in the rating task. For the choice and rating task and for positive and negative IC verb sentences, a 3*2*2 mixed design ANOVA was conducted with two within-subject variables: Perspective (neutral, and Protagonist (NP1, NP2), and one between-subject variable: Culture (Chinese, Dutch). The dependent variables were the mean protagonist choice percentages and the mean protagonist rating scores 2.3 Results In this section, we first present descriptives of the choice and the rating tasks and the culture adherence questions (Section 2.3.1). In Section 2.3.2 we present detailed results of the choice and the rating tasks as described above. In Section 2.3.3, we present additional analyses not based on the nationality of participants (Chinese vs. Dutch), but on their responses of the cultural adherence questions. 250 Chapter 2Table 2.2.a Mean percentage of Chinese and Dutch participants' choice for the biased protagonist in all IC1 and IC2 verb sentences and in the three perspectives (neutral, biased-self, non-biased-self). From top to bottom: all sentences, positive sentences, of Chinese and Dutch participants' rating scores for the biased protagonist in all IC1 and IC2 verb sentences and in the three perspectives (neutral, biased-self, biased-other). From top to bottom: all sentences, positive sentences, perspective and culture on implicit causality2.3.1 Descriptives Overall means The choice data in Table 2.2.a and the rating scores in Table 2.2.b show a mixed picture. IC2 verbs show on average a stronger IC bias than IC1 verbs in all three conditions, albeit somewhat less pronounced in the rating scores than in the choice scores. Furthermore, for the two verb types, the IC bias is weaker in the biased-self condition as compared to the non-biased-self condition, not only for negative verbs, as we hypothesized, but also for positive verbs. For IC2 verbs, the IC bias is weaker in the biased-self condition as compared to the neutral condition, again not only for negative verbs, as expected, but also for positive verbs. Dutch and Chinese participants do not differ systematically, with a slight tendency for Chinese participants to score higher in IC2 verbs, and Dutch participants in IC1 verbs, both for positive and negative verbs. Taken together, there is a clear difference in bias strength between IC1 and IC2 verbs, both in the choice and in the rating task: the participants were more likely to choose or rate the NP2 protagonist as the causer in the IC2 verb sentences than to choose or rate the NP1 protagonist as the causer in the IC1 verb sentences, suggesting the relevance of differences in syntactic position as found as well in Wang et al. (2015;2017;2021). Also, we can observe a consistent difference in bias strength between the choice and rating task with the choice task eliciting a stronger bias as compared to the rating task. This is consistent with the conclusions in Hartshorne (2014) that the re-mention task (our choice task) and the causal attribution task (our rating task) are connected only weakly. Apart from that, this result may have been caused by the difference between the forced choice in case of the choice task and the possibility of making more nuanced causal judgments in the scale- based rating task. Verbs across conditions Tables 2.3.a and 2.3.b show the IC bias strength per verb. We can observe that the IC bias of the verbs is congruent with the different classes of verbs based on thematic roles, with Agent Patient (AP) and the Stimulus Experiencer (SE) verbs having an NP1 bias, and Agent Evocator and the Experiencer Stimulus verbs NP2 bias. 252 Chapter followed by the type of verb (in terms of thematic roles), the percentage of participants' choice for the biased protagonist according to Ferstl et al. (2011), and the percentage of choice and rating in the three perspective conditions (neutral, biased-self, non-biased-self). Type Ferstl Neutral Self Neutral Self biased and culture on implicit causalityTable 2.3.b The followed by the type of verb (in terms of thematic roles), the percentage of participants' choice for the biased protagonist according to Ferstl et al. (2011), and the percentage of choice and rating in the three perspective conditions (neutral, biased-self, non-biased-self). Type Ferstl Neutral Self Neutral Self each a clear and strong IC bias (75+%) based on Ferstl et al. (2011). Tables 2.3.a and 2.3.b show that all verbs show the expected preference, but on average less strongly than in Ferstl et al. (2011), especially for the (positive) IC1 verbs. This is partly due to the weak bias of some of the verbs, with lowest scores for the IC1 verbs amuse, charm, delight, please, anger, and harm, and for the IC2 verbs ridicule and cherish. We assume these verbs offer participants verb specific ways to escape from the bias. See examples 2 and 3, where the completion does not explain what 'I' did to harm or please 'Mary' (thus following the bias of the verb) but explains the reason on the part of the other protagonist that caused me doing that: because Mary had harmed me earlier, or has been nice to me earlier. 254 Chapter 2(2) I harmed Mary, because she had harmed me. (SSB5987) (3) I pleased Mary, because she had been nice to me. (SSB4210) Note that the relative high scores of Ferstl et al. (2011) are partly due to the way they calculated the IC bias. They asked participants to complete sentences without asking them to carry out a forced choice, and in calculating the IC bias strength, they excluded all cases in which participants completed sentences in ways other than using one of the two protagonists as subject of the completion sentences. Furthermore, unlike our participants, their participants were native speakers of the language. Cultural adherence questions The mean cultural adherence questions show that Chinese participants value their culture higher than Dutch participants, thus confirming the difference between collectivistic and individualistic cultures as claimed by e.g., Hofstede (1980), Triandis (1995), and Markus and Kitayama (1991). The four cultural adherence questions show a good reliability, Cronbach's alpha = .79. On average, the Chinese participants valued Chinese culture (M = 2.56, SD = 0.49) more than the Dutch participants valued Dutch culture (M = 1.93, SD = 0.54), t(1, 140) = 7.32, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.56), see Figure 2.4. The Chinese participants largely rated their culture in the top two quartiles. More than half of the Chinese participants valued their culture either very much (M = 3,00, 32%) or near very much (M = 2,75, 29%). In contrast, the scores of the Dutch participants were more normally distributed, with most of the participants scoring their culture with quite a bit (M = 2,25, 22%) or near quite a bit (M = 1,75, 21%). Given these differences, we carried out additional analyses (see Section 2.3) comparing the data of Chinese vs. Dutch participants with participants with high vs. low scores on these cultural adherence questions. 55 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalityFigure 2.4 Percentage pyramid distribution by participants' cultural background (left: Dutch, right: Chinese) and mean scores of four cultural adherence questions expressed as one of 12 quartiles on 4-point scale (ranging from very little, a little, quite a bit to very much) in the cultural adherence task 2.3.2 Testing the hypotheses In this section, we make a comparison of the choice and rating scores in the two SS bias conditions (biased-self and non-biased-self) and the neutral condition, for the two culture groups. In addition, we present analyses that take the culture adherence task results into account. Table 2.4 presents the mean percentage scores of the choice and the rating task of the biased-self, the non-biased-self, and the protagonists in the neutral condition. Repeated analyses of variance were performed with Culture (Chinese, Dutch) as a between participants factor and Perspective (neutral, biased-self, non-biased-self), and Protagonist (NP1/subject vs. NP2/object) as within participant factors. Below, the results of the analyses are presented for the choice task and the rating task, for positive and negative IC verb sentences, separately. Additional sub-analyses are provided if necessary. 256 Chapter 2Table 2.4 Mean Chinese and Dutch choice and rating scores for the NP1 ('I'/actor/subject) protagonist and the NP2 ('me'/ active observer/object) protagonist in positive and negative IC verb sentences in the three perspectives (neutral, biased-self, non-biased-self). Task Culture Polarity Protagonist verb sentences. H2a(i) predicted that people would be more likely to choose themselves as the causer of positive IC verb sentences in the self perspectives than in the neutral perspective, which was not supported. There was no difference between the biased- self scores and the neutral scores: F(1, 140) = 0.152, p = .697. The comparison between the biased-self scores and the non-biased-self scores actually showed a difference in the opposite direction. The biased-self scores were not higher but lower than the non-biased- self scores: F(1, 140) = 16.618, p = .000, 2 = .106. This means that H2a(ii) was not supported. The same pattern emerged in the separate analyses of the protagonists. No difference between NP1 biased-self and NP1 neutral: F(1, 140) = 0.269, p scores were lower NP1 = 16.016, between NP2 scores and NP2 neutral scores: F(1, 140) = 1.323, p = .252, but a near significant difference in the opposite direction for the NP2 biased-self and NP2 non-biased-self scores: F(1, 140) = 3.251, p = .074, 2 =.023. There was no effect of Culture and there was no interaction between Culture and Perspective. Culture: F(1,140) = 0.005, p = .432; NP2: = 1.362, p = .245. Culture F(2, 280) = 1.739, p = .405; NP2: F(2, 280) = 1.191, p = .302. This means that there was no support for H4a.57 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalityThere was an effect of Protagonist. The mean scores for the first protagonist (NP1) were lower than for the second protagonist (NP2): F(1, 140) = 43.931, p < .001, 2 = .024. And there was an interaction between Protagonist and Perspective, F(2, 280) = 6.104, p = .003, 2 = .042. For each perspective, NP1 was lower than NP2 but this was most pronounced in the neutral condition. The interaction of Protagonist and Culture was not significant: F(1, 140) = 1.928, p = .167. Negative IC verb sentences. Table 2.4 shows that in the choice task, overall, the scores in the biased-self condition in negative IC verb sentences seemed to be lower than those in the non-biased-self and neutral conditions, regardless of culture. Analyses showed that the biased-self scores were lower than the non-biased-self scores: F(1, 140) = 17.043, p <.001, 2 = .109, which supported hypothesis H1a(ii), but there was no support for hypothesis H1a(i): the biased-self scores did not differ from the neutral scores: F(1, 140) = 2.199, p = .140, 2 = .062. The sub-analysis for the first protagonist showed an effect of Perspective: F(2, 280) = 7.411, p = .001, 2 =.050. The NP1 biased-self scores were lower than the NP1 non-biased-self scores: F(1, 140) = 9.570, p = .002, =.064, but equal to the NP1 neutral scores: F(1, 140) =2.199, p = .140. These results were in line with H1a(ii) but not with H1a(i). For the second protagonist, the biased-self scores were also lower than the non-biased-self scores: F(1, 140) = 8.544, p = .004, 2 = .058, which was in line with H1a(ii). However, in this case there was also support for H1a(i): the NP2 biased-self scores were lower than the NP2 neutral scores: F(1, 140) = 7.189, p = .008, 2 = .049. There was no influence of Culture: F(1,140) = 0.004, p = .948. This was also the case in the sub-analyses per protagonist: NP1 F(1, 140) NP2 F(1, 140) = 2.302, p = .131. And there was no interaction between Culture and Perspective. Overall: F(2, 280) = 0.075, p = .262; NP2: F(2, 280) = 0.643, p = .526. This means that there was no support for H3a. Finally, as in positive IC verb sentences, there was an overall effect of Protagonist in negative IC verb sentences. The mean scores for the first protagonist were lower than for the second protagonist: F(1, 140) = 6.291, p = .013, 2 = .043. And there was an interaction between Protagonist and Perspective, F(2, 280) = 3.934, p = .021, 2 = .027, which was qualified by a difference between protagonists in the neutral condition (NP1 < NP2), but not in the biased conditions. The interaction of Protagonist and Culture was also significant: F(1, 140) = 4.794, p = .030, 2 = .033, caused by a difference between protagonists (NP1 < NP2) for the Chinese but not for the Dutch (NP1 = NP2). 2.3.2.2 Rating task Positive IC verb sentences. H2b(i) predicted that people would be more likely to rate themselves higher as the causer of positive IC verb sentences in the self perspectives than in the neutral perspective, which was not supported. There was no difference between the biased-self ratings scores and the neutral rating scores: F(1, 140) = 0.751, p = .388. As in the choice task, the comparison between the biased-self rating scores and the non-biased-self rating scores showed a difference in the opposite direction. The biased-self rating scores 258 Chapter 2were lower than the non-biased-self rating scores, but this difference was not significant: F(1, 140) = .2.799, p = .097, 2 = .020. This means that H2b(ii) was not supported. The separate analyses of the protagonists showed that the rating scores for the NP1 biased-self were higher that those for the NP1 neutral: F(1, 140) = 4.299, p = .040, 2 = .030. This supported hypothesis H2b(i). However, the NP1 biased-self rating scores did not differ from the NP1 non-biased-self rating scores: F(1, 140) = 2.748, p = .100. For the NP2 protagonist, no significant differences were found. NP2 biased-self rating scores versus NP2 neutral rating = 1.471, rating scores: F(1, 140) = 0.524, p = .470. There was no effect of Culture and there were no interactions involving Culture. Culture: F(1,140) = 1.207, p = .274. This was also the case in the sub-analyses: NP1: F(1, 140) = 0.016, p = .899; NP2: = 2.003, p = .159. Culture F(2, 280) = 0.293, p = .778; NP2: F(2, 280) = 0.086, p = .916. This means that there was no support for H4b. There was an effect of Protagonist. The mean rating scores for the first protagonist were lower than for the second protagonist: F(1, 140) = 24.890, p <.001, 2 = .151. And there was an interaction between Protagonist and Perspective, F(2, 280) = 6.152, p = .002, 2 = .042. As in the choice task, for each perspective, NP1 was lower than NP2 but this was most pronounced in the neutral condition. The interaction of Protagonist and Culture was not significant: F(1, 140) = 1.076, p = .301. Negative IC verb sentences. As in the choice task, the data of the rating task indicated that, overall, the rating scores in the biased-self condition in negative IC verb sentences seemed to be lower than those in the non-biased-self and neutral conditions, regardless of culture (see Table 2.4). However, the analyses did not bear this out. There were no differences between the biased-self rating scores and the neutral rating scores: F(1, 140) = 1.323, p = .252, and between the biased-self rating scores and the non-biased rating scores, F(1, 140) = 1.994, p = .160. These results did not support hypotheses H1b(i) and H1b(ii). However, a separate analysis of the rating scores for the NP1 protagonist revealed an effect of perspective. The biased-self rating scores were lower than the non-biased-self rating scores, supporting H1b(ii): F(1, 140) = 4.753, p = .031, 2 = .033. Such support was not found for H1b(i). The biased-self rating scores did not differ from the neutral rating scores: F(1, 140) = 0.087, p = .768. Nor were the hypotheses supported in the sub-analyses of the second protagonist: biased-self vs neutral F(1, 0.001, biased-self vs non-biased-self F(1, 140) = 0.011, p = .916. There was no influence of Culture: F(1,140) = 0.152, p = .698. This was also the case in the sub-analyses: NP1 F(1, 140) = 1.937, p = .162; NP2 F(1, 140) = 2.654, p = .106. And there were no interactions between Culture and Perspective. Overall: F(2, 280) = 0.919, p = .947; NP2: F(2, 280) = 2.028, p = .134. This means that there was no support for H3b. Finally, unlike in positive IC verb sentences, there was no effect of Protagonist in negative IC verb sentences: F(1, 140) = 1.721, p = .192. And there was no interaction between Protagonist and Perspective, F(2, 280) = 2.386, p = .094, 2 = .017. However, the 59 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalityinteraction between Protagonist and Culture was significant: F(1, 140) = 5.271, p = .023, 2 = .036, caused by a difference between protagonists (NP1 < NP2) for the Chinese but not for the Dutch (NP1 = NP2). In sum, the strongest evidence for the SS bias showed up in negative IC verb sentences. It was weaker in positive IC verb sentences. In addition, the bias showed itself more clearly in the comparison with the non-biased-self condition than with the neutral condition. Although the hypotheses about culture were not confirmed, there was a difference between Chinese and Dutch participants choice and rating scores of the two protagonists. The results indicated that the NP1 (actor) was chosen less often and rated lower than the NP2 (active observer) overall, but this difference was larger for Chinese participants than for Dutch participants. 2.3.3 Additional analysis The descriptives of the cultural adherence task in Figure 2.4 showed that the Chinese participants valued Chinese cultures more than the Dutch participants valued Dutch culture. In order to test whether the participants who valued their own culture more also tended to make more self-serving attributions in the IC verb sentences, we further analyzed for Chinese and Dutch participants the correlations between the cultural adherence scores in the cultural adherence task on the one hand, and the scores between the self perspectives and the neutral perspective in the choice and the rating task on the other hand. For the Chinese participants, the following correlations were marginally significant: in the NP2 perspective of the negative IC1 verb sentences in the rating task, r = -.18, p = .08; in the NP1 perspective of the positive IC1 verb sentences in the rating task, r = .18, p = .07; in the NP2 perspective of the negative IC2 verb sentences in the choice task, r = -.15, p = .10. For the Dutch participants, only in the choice task a significant or marginally significant correlation with the cultural adherence scores was found: in the NP2 perspective of the negative IC2 verb sentences, r = -.23, p = .04; in the NP1 perspective of the negative IC2 verb sentences, r = -.17, p = .09; in the NP2 perspective of the positive IC2 verb sentences, r = .40, p < .001. These correlations suggest that the higher the participants' cultural adherence score was, the more likely they chose and rated the negative IC verb sentences to the other protagonist and the positive IC verb sentences to themselves. This pattern seems to apply to both cultural groups. Yet, the correlation results vary between the choice and the rating tasks, with more correlation results in line with the SS bias in the choice task than in the rating task. As a next step, we re-analyzed the data with only the participants who valued their culture 'quite a bit' and 'very much' in the choice and the rating tasks. This analysis involved 102 participants, 72% of the total number of participants. Of these participants, 67 were Chinese and 35 Dutch. The results were similar to the ones reported above in Section 2.3.2 (see the appendix 2.5 for the statistics), indicating that the difference in the cultural adherence between the Chinese and the Dutch did not have an effect on the choice and rating scores. 260 Chapter 22.4 Discussion As far as we know, cultural differences in SS bias effects using implicit causality verbs have not been studied. In this chapter, we investigated whether Western people would be more likely to make self-serving attributions in interpersonal events than Eastern people. We investigated whether the SS bias appeared at a behavioral level and at a linguistic level. In order to do so, we conducted an experiment with Chinese and Dutch participants involving a choice task, a sentence completion task and a rating task. We tested whether the participants attributed the cause of interpersonal events in positive and negative IC verb sentences to the biased protagonist in a neutral condition and two self perspective conditions. We compared the mean choice percentages and the mean rating scores of the self protagonist ('I' or 'me' in the sentences) in biased position with those of the self in non- biased position and with those of the protagonist in the neutral condition. We hypothesized that participants would tend to attribute negative events to others, and positive events to themselves. We also asked participants to complete the sentences according to the choices they made. The results of this completion task are analyzed separately in Chapter 4. The hypothesized effects of perspective on the negative IC verb sentences are partly confirmed in both the choice task and the rating task, but only partly and not consistently. For negative verbs, we only found significantly lower biased-self choices as compared to non-biased-self choices, while ratings differed only significantly for protagonists (biased < non-biased-self). As far as the results confirm the hypotheses, they are in line with the previous SS bias studies using IC verb sentences (Cunningham et al. 1979; Kasof & Lee 1993; Wang et al. 2015; 2017; 2021). The effect of perspective on positive IC verb sentences was not found in the choice task, only in rating scores of NP1 protagonists (biased-self > neutral): The participants were more likely to rate themselves as the causer of the event in positive IC verb sentences in biased position than a neutral protagonist in biased position. In the choice task, the results indicated an opposite tendency. This was not completely unexpected. As said, the effect of the SS bias in positive IC verb sentences only appeared in studies that used rating tasks, such as Kasof and Lee (1993) and Wang et al. (2015; 2021). A potential explanation is that the linguistic choice task is a less explicit way to elicit causal attributions, compared to the behavioral rating task. Detailed differences between the two tasks will be presented after the discussion of the hypotheses. As to the role of culture, we did not find that culture modified how the participants attributed negative or positive events in either the choice task or the rating task. The results indicated that the Dutch participants were equally likely to attribute negative events to others and to attribute positive events to themselves as the Chinese participants. Although Hartshorne et al. (2013) showed that the IC bias is stable across four cultures, meta-analysis studies in the social psychological field, such as Heine and Hamamura (2007) and Mezulis et al. (2004), showed a weaker SS bias among Eastern people than Western people. An explanation may be that the effect size of the SS bias in our study was small, which might make it difficult to test potential cultural differences. In the social psychological studies reviewed in the two meta-analysis studies, there is no clear evidence in experiments for whether people attribute 61 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalityevents to themselves or not. For example, as mentioned in Kashima and Triandis (1986), American and Japanese people were asked to attribute their successes or failures in a memory task to their ability, efforts, task difficulty, or to luck. In the task, there was no clear evidence regarding whether the participants should attribute their successes or failures to internal causes, such as ability and efforts, or external ones, such as task difficulty and luck. Their results showed that people tended to make self-serving attributions to keep a positive self- image: They attributed their successes to internal causes, while attributing failures to external causes. And the American people were more likely to do so than the Japanese people. In their study, the effect of the SS bias and the modification of culture on the SS bias appeared to be relatively strong. Different from the measures in these meta-analyses, in our study, the causal attribution was more indirect and the selected IC verbs indicated with a strong bias which protagonist should be the causer. The participants took the IC bias into consideration, as most participants in our experiment still chose or rated the biased protagonist according to the IC bias, even in the self perspectives. This may be seen as lending support to the cognitive-driven as opposed to the motivation-driven explanation of the SSB (Shepperd et al. 2008): participants not just make attributions to keep a positive self-image, but also to study their own behavior objectively as much as they study others' behavior, in order to have an accurate evaluation of themselves. Yet, it is more likely that participants in biased position in negative events, who choose to follow the bias despite the possible threat for their image, do so more because of the strong and intrinsic implicit causality bias of the verb, rather than the considerations given in Shepperd et al. (2008). Culture did not have any effect in this study. Therefore, in the next chapter, we will add another variable on top of the self perspective, i.e., group membership. We will specify the interpersonal relationship between the two protagonists by introducing them as member of the same ingroup or as members of competing social groups (the outgroup). Eastern people are believed to pay more attention to interpersonal relationships than Western people (Yuki et al. 2005). For example, Eastern people have a clearer notion of group membership, compared to Western people (e.g., Ma-Kellams et al. 2011). If the interpersonal relationship between the two protagonists in the IC verb sentences is specified, a test of the influence of culture on the SS bias may be more detectable. In addition to the hypotheses, we found only a weak confirmation of the idea that the SSB effect is stronger in the rating task than in the choice task: In the rating task, we not only found the expected effect on negative verbs, as in the choice task, but also on positive verbs, but we only found an effect on NP1 protagonists. The divergence between the two tasks is argued for in Hartshorne (2014). He suggested that rating tasks are more intrusive and more explicitly test participants' causal behavioral judgment, while choice tasks test participants' linguistic referential choice in a more implicit way. The more intrusive nature of rating tasks makes it more likely for participants to take into account other than verb- semantic variables in attributing causes (like e.g., social status or gender), compared to the choice task. In his view, this explains the fact that the results of these two tasks in his studies only weakly correlate in terms of the IC bias strength. The picture of the results in our study is less pronounced, however, than what would be expected on the basis of these ideas. 262 Chapter 2One reason may be that we asked respondents to rate causes as their last task and based on the choice plus completions they previously had produced, which makes the task more dependent on and influenced by the choice task than in the studies of Hartshorne (2014). A striking result is the difference we found between the SSB effect in NP1 and NP2 protagonist position. The results of the choice task showed an effect of protagonist position in positive and negative IC verb sentences, regardless of IC bias. Choices for the protagonist in first position were smaller than those for the protagonist in second position, and the effect was strongest in the neutral sentences. A similar effect was only found in positive IC verb sentences in the rating task. In addition, the effect was more pronounced for Eastern than for Western people. These first and second protagonist positions coincide with the subject/actor and the object/active observer roles, respectively. For as much as these findings apply to the biased perspectives, it seems that the subject/actor position is less often chosen than the object/ active observer position. For negative events, this is in line with Wang et al. (2015; 2017; 2021) who found that people were more likely to make self-serving attributions when they were in the subject position than in the object position. They believed that subject and object position coincided with the actor and observer roles. They claimed that when participants were in the subject position, they were the actor and that they took the initiative and actively performed the action described by the IC verbs. In contrast, when the participants were in the object position, they were active observers and that they only passively received uncontrollable actions. They also claimed that in negative events, the participants were more eager to avoid responsibilities when they were actors instead of observers, which is corroborated by our data. For positive events, Wang et al. did not find this NP1/actor effect, which makes it difficult to explain why we also found lower NP1 bias than NP2 bias, but it does not contradict other studies that also found mixed results for positive events (Kasof & Lee 1993; Wang et al. 2015; 2021). The difference between the two protagonist positions was strong for the Eastern participants and weak or absent for Western participants, suggesting that Eastern participants focused more on the object/active observer role than the subject/actor role, and this was most clear in the neutral perspective. Yet, there is no agreement on whether actor and observer roles should coincide with syntactic positions or with thematic roles. As mentioned, different from Wang et al., Kasof and Lee (1993) suggested that actor and observer should coincide with thematic roles instead of with subject and object positions. For example, for an IC2 verb, such as dislike , Kasof and Lee considered that when participants take the stimulus role (i.e., the NP2 protagonist in John dislikes me ) they view the event from an actor perspective; when they take the experiencer role, the NP1 protagonist in I dislike John, they view the event from an active observer perspective. In contrast, based on the syntactic view, Wang and colleagues suggest that when participants are in the subject position, the NP1 protagonist in I dislike John, they view the event from the actor perspective, while when they are in the object position, the NP2 protagonist in John dislikes me , they view the event from the active observer condition (Wang et al. 2015; 2021). Because Wang et al. did not reveal exactly which IC2 verbs they used in their studies, it is unclear how they would assign address these IC2 verbs in terms of the actor-observer roles from the syntactic view. The significant effect of protagonist (NP1 < 63 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalityNP2) implemented a subject vs. object may suggest support for the syntactic view. A factor that may affect the comparison of the results of the present study with previous research is the type of task used. In the present study, a sentence completion task is used. Participants were required to come up with a reason or cause for the event in the main clause. In previous IC studies, a cause to the event was provided, for instance, being that kind of person. Wang et al. (2017) used this fixed stable cause and asked participants to choose the causer. They found that 20% fewer participants chose themselves as the causers of negative events than the other protagonist. In contrast, in our choice task with the open-end format of sentence completion task, only 5% fewer participants did so. We know that stable negative events (e.g., I irritated Mary, because I am that kind of person) cause more severe damage to one's self-image than less stable negative events (e.g., I irritated Mary, because I was late for our appointment) (Dunning 1995). Therefore, the small difference in our data may well be explained by our participants completing negative sentences using causes with different degrees of stability, as compared to the stable predefined completion in Wang et al. Yet, this cannot explain why Wang et al. did not find any difference in positive sentences, though also there, the same predefined stable completion is used. Here, the most plausible explanation is that, overall, the SS bias effect in positive events is weaker than in negative events. In a widely cited review study, Baumeister et al. (2001) found that across a broad range of psychological phenomena, there is a greater influence of negativity over positivity as a general principle. In their view, the stronger effect of negativity over positivity is because \"the self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones (p. 323)\". In terms of the SS bias in the IC verb sentences, this means that the motivation to avoid damaging the self-image is stronger than to enhance the self-image. Even if the participants can attribute positive events to a stable cause such as a positive trait, they may not be motivated to do so, at least not as compelling as to avoid being associated with negative traits. To conclude, by investigating how Chinese and Dutch people make self-serving attributions in the IC verb sentences, in this chapter, we found partial confirmation for the idea that when people were involved in interpersonal events, they tend to attribute negative events to others in the choice and the rating tasks, and to attribute positive events to themselves in the rating task, compared to events that they were not involved in. Yet, we did not find that Dutch people were more likely to make self-serving attributions than Chinese people in either the choice or the rating task in either negative or positive sentences. In order to further test potential cultural differences, Chapter 3 intends to strengthen the influence of the SS bias by introducing group membership as a factor. 264 Chapter 22.5 Appendix: Re-analysis results We re-analyzed the data with only the participants who valued their culture 'quite a bit' and 'very much' in the choice and the rating tasks (n=102, 72%, 67 Chinese, 35 Dutch). The results were similar to those in the main analysis. The strongest evidence for the SS bias showed up in negative IC verb sentences. Also, the SS bias showed itself more clearly in the comparison with the non-biased-self condition than with the neutral condition. The hypotheses about culture were not confirmed. Choice task Positive IC verb sentences. H2a(i) predicted that people would be more likely to choose themselves as the causer of positive IC verb sentences in the self perspectives than in the neutral perspective, which was not supported. There was no difference between the biased- self scores and the neutral scores: F(1, 100) = 0.321, p = .572. The comparison between the biased-self scores and the non-biased-self scores actually showed a difference in the opposite direction. The biased-self scores were not higher but lower than the non-biased- self scores: F(1, 100) = 9.011, p = .003, 2 = .083. This means that H2a(ii) was not supported. The same pattern emerged in the separate analyses of the protagonists. No difference between NP1 biased-self and NP1 neutral: F (1, 100) = 0.010, p = .921, and NP1 biased-self scores were lower than NP1 non-biased-self scores: F (1, 100) = 12.378, p = .001, 2 =.110; and no difference between NP2 biased-self scores and NP2 neutral scores: F(1, 100) = 0.655, p = between the NP2 biased-self and NP2 non-biased-self scores: F (1, 100) = 0.923, p = .339. There was no effect of Culture and there was no interaction between Culture and Perspective. Culture: F(1,100) = 0.098, p = .546; NP2: = 1.969, p = .164. Culture Perspective: F(2, 200) = 0.836, p = .435; NP1: F (2, 200) = 0.432, p = .650; NP2: F (2, 200) = 0.585, p = .558. This means that there was no support for H4a. There was an effect of Protagonist. The mean scores for the first protagonist (NP1) were lower than for the second protagonist (NP2): F(1, 100) = 21.516, p < .001, 2 = .177. And there was an interaction between Protagonist and Perspective, F(2, 200) = 4.192, p = .016, 2 = .040. For each perspective, NP1 was lower than NP2 but this was most pronounced in the neutral condition. The interaction of Protagonist and Culture was not significant: F(1, 100) = 1.765, p = .187. Negative IC verb sentences. Analyses showed that the biased-self scores were lower than the non-biased-self scores: F (1, 100) = 14.175, p < .001, 2 = .124, which supported hypothesis H1a(ii), but there was no support for hypothesis H1a(i): the biased-self scores did not differ from the neutral scores: F(1, 100) = 2.389, p = .125. The sub-analysis for the first protagonist showed an effect of Perspective: F(2, 200) = 6.018, p = .003, 2 =.057. The NP1 biased-self scores were lower than the NP1 non-biased-self scores: F (1, 100) = 6.175, p = .015, 2 =.058, but did not differ from the NP1 neutral scores: F(1, 100) =0.834, p = .363. These results were in line with H1a(ii) but not with H1a(i). For the second protagonist, the biased-self scores were also lower than the non-biased-self scores: F (1, 100) = 8.768, p = .004, 2 = .081, which was in 65 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causalityline with H1a(ii). However, in this case there was also support for H1a(i): the NP2 biased-self scores were lower than the NP2 neutral scores: F (1, 100) = 8.285, p = .005, 2 = .077. There was no influence of Culture: F(1,100) = 0.176, p = .676. This was also the case in the sub-analyses per protagonist of NP2 negative verb sentences, but not the case in the NP1 negative verb sentences: NP1 F(1, 100) = 3.890, p = .051. The Chinese participants were less likely to choose the biased protagonist than the Dutch participants; NP2 F(1, 100) = 2.415, p = .123. And there was no interaction between Culture and Perspective. Overall: F(2, 200) = 0.206, p = .814; NP1: F(2, 200) = 3.087, p = .048. The Chinese participants were less likely to choose themselves as the causer of negative IC1 verb sentences in the biased- self perspective than the other protagonist in the neutral perspective, while the Dutch participants were more likely to choose themselves as the causer of negative IC1 verb sentences in the biased-self perspective than the neutral perspective. This is not what we predicted; NP2: F(2, 200) = 1.192, p = .306. This means that there was no support for H3a. Finally, there was no overall effect of Protagonist in negative IC verb sentences: F(1, 100) = 2.845, p = .095. And there was an interaction between Protagonist and Perspective, F(2, 200) = 4.772, p = .009, 2 = .046, which was qualified by a difference between protagonists in the neutral condition (NP1 < NP2), but not in the biased conditions. The interaction of Protagonist and Culture was also significant: F(1, 100) = 7.220, p = .008, 2 = .067, caused by a difference between protagonists (NP1 < NP2) for the Chinese but not for the Dutch (NP1 = NP2). Rating task Positive IC verb sentences. H2b(i) predicted that people would be more likely to rate themselves higher as the causer of positive IC verb sentences in the self perspectives than in the neutral perspective, which was not supported. There was no difference between the biased-self ratings scores and the neutral rating scores: F(1, 100) = 0.609, p = .437, and no difference between the biased-self rating scores and the non-biased-self rating scores: F(1, 100) = .3.268, p = .074. This means that H2b(ii) was not supported. The separate analyses of the protagonists showed that the rating scores for the NP1 biased-self did not differ from those for the NP1 neutral: F(1, 100) = 2.174, p = .144. This did not support hypothesis H2b(i). The NP1 biased-self rating scores were not higher but lower than the NP1 non-biased-self rating scores: F(1, 100) = 5.026, p = .027, which is opposite to hypothesis H2b (ii). For the NP2 protagonist, no significant differences were found. NP2 biased-self rating scores versus NP2 neutral rating = 0.582, scores versus NP2 non-biased-self rating scores: F (1, 100) = 0.104, p = .748. There was no effect of Culture and there were no interactions involving Culture. Culture: F(1,100) = 1.390, p = .241. This was also the case in the sub-analyses: NP1: F(1, 100) = 0.027, p = .870; NP2: = 3.219, p = .076. Culture F(2, 200) = 0.681, p = .697; NP2: F(2, 200) = 0.461, p = .631. This means that there was no support for H4b. There was an effect of Protagonist. The mean rating scores for the first protagonist were lower than for the second protagonist: F(1, 100) = 18.406, p < .001, 2 = .155. And there was an interaction between Protagonist and Perspective, F(2, 200) = 5.951, p = .003, 266 Chapter 22 = .056. As in the choice task, for each perspective, NP1 was lower than NP2 but this was most pronounced in the neutral condition. The interaction of Protagonist and Culture was not significant: F(1, 100) = 0.681, p = .507. Negative IC verb sentences. There were no differences between the biased-self rating scores and the neutral rating scores: F(1, 100) = 1.433, p = .234, and between the biased-self rating scores and the non-biased rating scores, F(1, 100) = 1.496, p = .224. These results did not support hypotheses H1b(i) and H1b(ii). A separate analysis of the rating scores for the first protagonist did not reveal an effect of perspective. The biased-self rating scores did not differ from the non-biased-self rating scores, so no support for H1b(ii): F(1, 140) = 3.551, p = .062, 2 = .034. The biased-self rating scores did not differ from the neutral rating scores: F(1, 100) = 0.683, p = .410, so no support for H1b (i). Nor were the hypotheses supported in the sub-analyses of the second protagonist: biased-self vs neutral F(1, 0.704, vs non-biased-self F(1, 100) = 0.024, p = There was no influence of Culture: F(1,100) = 0.567, p = .453. In the sub-analyses, this was the case in NP1 verb sentences, but not in the NP2 F(1, 100) = 5.149, p = .025. The Dutch participants were more likely to choose the biased protagonist than the Chinese participants in the NP2 negative verb sentences. And there were no interactions between Culture and Perspective. Overall: F(2, 200) = 0.911, p = .962; NP2: F(2, 220) = 1.452, p = .237. This means that there was no support for H3b. Finally, unlike in positive IC verb sentences, there was no effect of Protagonist in negative IC verb sentences: F(1, 100) = 0.796, p = .374. And there was no interaction between Protagonist and Perspective, F(2, 200) = 1.415, p = .245. However, the interaction between Protagonist and Culture was significant: F(2, 200) = 8.427, p = .005, 2 = .078, caused by a difference between protagonists (NP1 < NP2) for the Chinese but not for the Dutch (NP1 = NP2).67 The influence of self perspective and culture on implicit causality 233CHAPTER 3 The infl uence of group membership, self perspecti ve and culture on implicit causality70 Chapter 33.1 Introduction When people make causal attributions about events happening around them, these attributions differ depending on the perspective people take. When they are themselves involved in the event, they view the event from their own perspective, which means that they are more likely to attribute positive events to themselves and negative events to others. When they are not involved in the event and view the event as an onlooker, no such self- centered effect occurs. Thus, people tend to make self-serving attributions when they are involved in the events. This attribution tendency can be explained by the idea that people tend to protect a positive self-image. The self-image people want to protect is an image of an individual self in the event. Yet, people are social beings and have a need to belong to a certain group (Baumeister & Leary 1995). Within the same group, people also want to maintain a good relationship with members in their group. That means that people also want to keep a positive image of the social self. An important part of the social self is the fact that people categorize others depending on group membership. They consider others as part of the same group with themselves, the ingroup, for example members of the same political party) or as part of a different group, the outgroup, for example when they support competing political parties (Tajfel et al. 1971). When people interact with others, they are known to favor ingroup members over outgroup members, or conversely, disfavor outgroup members over ingroup members. This phenomenon is known as the intergroup or IG bias (e.g., Tajfel & Turner,1979; Turner et al. 1979), which is the topic of this chapter. In Chapter 2, we have found partial support for the idea that the implicit causality bias (the IC bias) can be influenced by the self-serving bias (the SS bias). In this chapter, we will continue and extend the research with an extra factor: group membership of protagonists involved in interpersonal events. What we want to investigate in this chapter is to what extent the intergroup (IG) bias modulates the effects of the SS bias we found in Chapter 2. In addition, we want to know to what extent the IG bias differs for people from different cultural backgrounds. People from different cultures are believed to put different weights on group membership in social interaction, with Eastern cultures putting more emphasis on group connectedness than Western cultures (Markus & Kitayama 1991; 2010; Triandis 1989). This suggests that Eastern people would be more likely to be influenced by the IG bias than Western people. As a method, we use incomplete implicit causality (IC) verb sentences, including the self as one of the two protagonists. In addition, the IC verb sentences are embedded in hypothetical scenarios in which the group membership of the two protagonists is manipulated in that the self and the other protagonist is either part of the same or a different group. Participants with different cultural background (Chinese vs. Dutch) are asked to choose one of the two protagonists as topic for the rest of the sentence and then to complete the sentence. In the remainder of this chapter, we will first discuss the way in which the social self and group membership can affect the way in which we interact with other people and the way we use language (Section 3.1.1). In Section 3.1.2 we will narrow the scope to the topic of this 71 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causalitychapter and look specifically at the influence of group membership on one specific type of social and linguistic behavior: the way in which people attribute causes to themselves and others, and the expected stronger effect of group membership on negative (as opposed to positive) events, the latter being the reason for us to restrict our study to negative events. In section 3.1.3, we discuss how we expect these effects to differ on the basis of culture. In section 3.1.4, we summarize the expectations for our study. In sections 3.2 to 3.4, we describe the method, results, and conclusions of our study. 3.1.1 The influence of group membership on behavior In making self-serving attributions, people want to protect a good image of the individual self. People also want to protect a good image of the social self, in order to maintain a good social relation with members in their own groups. This motive to maintain a good social relation with ingroup members leads people to favor ingroup members over outgroup members, i.e., the IG bias. In this section, we will review literature on the effect of the social self on social behavior and language use. The self-image that people motivate to protect themselves can be either related to the individual self (cf. Chapter 2), or to the social self, i.e., the group an individual is part of. According to social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner 1979; Turner et al. 1979) and self-categorization theory (Turner et al. 1987; Turner & Onorato 1999; Turner & Reynolds 2011), the social self refers to characteristics that an individual derives from connections with close others (e.g., family members, relatives, and friends) and meaningful groups that individuals can be part of (e.g., political parties, religious communities, and sports clubs). These groups are considered to facilitate attachment to close ones and belongingness to near others. In contrast, the individual self refers to characteristics that are unique to an individual, differentiating the person from others. These two types of self suggest that the motivation to protect a positive self-image could be either to protect the individual self or the social self. The motive to protect a good image of the individual self has been shown to lead people to make self-serving attributions in the IC verb sentences in Chapter 2. In this chapter, we investigate whether the motive to protect a good image of the social self may also modify how people attribute causes to protagonists of the same or different group. In a context in which group membership is relevant, the motive to protect a good image of the social self leads to intergroup bias (Tajfel & Turner 1979). The intergroup (IG) bias refers to a tendency that people treat one's own group or its members more favorably than an outgroup or its members. It is \"an unfair evaluative, emotional, cognitive, or behavioral response toward another group in ways that devalue or disadvantage the other group and its members\" (Dovidio & Gaertner 2010, p. 1084). According to the social identity theory proposed by Tajfel and Turner (1979), individuals are intrinsically motivated to achieve positive distinctiveness, or a positive self-image. In intergroup interactions, groups offer people an identity at a social level, who we are, or the social self. Favoring ingroup over outgroup or disfavoring outgroup over ingroup enhances or maintains a relatively high ingroup status. The relatively high ingroup status satisfies people's need for a positive self- image at a social level. 372 Chapter 3One of the forms that the IG bias can take is to derogate the outgroup (Hewstone et al. 2002). Biased responses towards outgroup members have been discussed by Allport (1954) in his classic book the Nature of Prejudice in which three explicit types of outgroup derogation were mentioned: verbal rejection (e.g., using discriminative racial epithets); discrimination (e.g., unequal treatment towards ethnic minority/segregation) and physical attack. Following Allport, researchers have extensively studied how group membership influences social interactions. For example, in several meta-analyses, people have consistently shown negative responses towards the outgroup. These responses include biased negative attitude towards outgroup, i.e., prejudice (Riek et al. 2006), overgeneralized beliefs towards the outgroup, i.e., stereotype (Nguyen & Ryan 2008), and unfair treatment towards the outgroup, i.e., discrimination (Balliet & De Dreu 2014). Sherif et al. (1954/1961) propose that discrimination against the outgroup is due to competition over limited valuable resources between groups. Stephan & Stephan (2000) propose that people exhibit hostility towards the outgroup when they perceive the outgroup as being in a position to harm them. This harm could be physical, a loss of valuable resources, or a challenge of group values. The IG bias has been considered as an important research topic and has been found to influence different types of social interaction. For example, sport fans evaluate ingroup fans more positively than rival outgroup fans (Wann & Grieve 2005). Supporters of opposing political parties evaluated their own party supporters more positively than supporters of a rival party (see Mason 2018 for a review). Religious people evaluated other people of the same religion group more favorable than people from a different religion group (Brandt & van Tongeren 2017; Johnson et al. 2012). The favorable attitudes towards ingroup members over outgroup members, such as members of one's own gender and race, have been found even among children before the age of five (see Over & McCall 2018 for a review). Apart from the influence of group membership on social behaviors, the IG bias has also been found to influence language use. In a series of papers, Maass and colleagues study the influence of group membership on language use (Maass et al. 1989; 1995; 1996). They investigated the relative abstractness of language use as an indicator of the IG bias. The abstractness of language idea comes from Semin and Fiedler's language categorization model (1988; 1991). In this model, language items were categorized in four classes of increasing abstractness, ranging from concrete descriptive action verbs (e.g., hit) to abstract adjective traits (e.g., being lovely) (Semin & Fiedler 1988; 1991). Using this typology, Maass and colleagues (1989; 1995; 1996) have shown that people used more abstract language terms when talking about positive ingroup and negative outgroup behaviors compared to negative ingroup and positive outgroup behaviors. They explain this on the basis of the group identity threat. People are more threatened by durable negative events (e.g., he hates me, he is hateful ) than less durable ones (e.g, he shouted at me ); conversely, they feel more appreciated by durable positive events (e.g., he loves me, he is grateful ) than less durable ones (e.g., he thanked me). Abstract verbs and adjectives express more long-lasting durable events (e.g., appreciate , hate), while concrete verbs express time-constrained events (e.g., kick, run). That way, the studies from Maass et al. (1989; 1995; 1996) show that people's language use implicitly display their preference for the ingroup over the outgroup. 73 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causalityIn Chapter 4, we will focus on language abstractness when we analyze and discuss the sentence completions related to the experiments in this thesis. In studying social interactions, the IG bias has been mostly studied using the method of explicitly asking participants to show their judgment towards the ingroup and the outgroup. This is done mostly by investigating observed behaviors and with rating measures (Lolliot et al. 2015). A typical example of observed behavioral measures are allocation tasks. These tasks investigate how people allocate valuable resources, e.g., money, to ingroup and outgroup members. Results showed that people tend to allocate more valuable resources to ingroup members than to outgroup members (Tajfel et al. 1971). Other widely used measures are rating tasks. These are questionnaire-based self-reports in which participants are explicitly asked to show their attitude towards ingroup and outgroup members, such as the General Evaluation Scale (the GES; Swart et al. 2011; Wright et al. 1997). The GES is a validated measure testing attitudes towards groups. It consists of a group of semantic opposition pairs used in semantic scales ranging from 1 (negative ) to 7 (positive). Participants are asked to rate their feelings towards different groups on each of these scales. Using such measurement instruments, it has been shown that participants rate outgroup members more negatively than ingroup members (Wright et al. 1997). In sum, the IG bias has mainly been studied by explicitly asking participants to decide how they would behave towards people of the same group or different groups in behavioral tasks, such as an allocation task, or asking participants to show their attitudes towards the ingroup and the outgroup on rating scales. In these measures, the participants are directly involved in the tasks, and they are conscious about the group membership investigated in the tasks. Therefore, the effect of the IG bias may be prominent. In our study, we also adopt the GES test, a social behavior measure, but only as a check of participants' attitudes towards ingroup and outgroup. We expect that our participants will rate outgroup members more negatively than ingroup members. Apart from measuring social behaviors directly and explicitly, participants can also be asked to carry out language tasks, like in the studies by Maass et al. (1989; 1995; 1996) described above. Maass, Castelli, and Arcuri (2000) claim that with explicit measures, participants can exert conscious control over their responses, while with implicit measures such as testing language preferences, participants are unlikely to exert conscious control over their responses and are generally unaware of the subtle variations in language use. These language tasks thus measure the effect of group membership indirectly and implicitly. In Maas et al. (1989; 1995; 1996), participants produce language which afterwards is analyzed in terms of abstractness (the way we will do it for sentence completions in Chapter 4). Similarly, in the current study, we will use the linguistic task of choosing one out of two protagonists, the self, and another protagonist, based on the question which of these two is considered most appropriate as topic of the subclause which has to be completed. Hartshorne (2014) has convincingly shown that making such referential choices is a linguistic task enabling us to elicit causal attributions from participants without asking them explicitly to attribute causes to one of these protagonists (as has been done in a rating task). In our experiment, sentences are preceded by scenarios participants are asked to imagine, in which the self and another protagonist are embedded either as ingroup or as outgroup members. 374 Chapter 33.1.2 The influence of IG bias on causal attributions in language use In this section, we will focus on the effect of group membership on one aspect of human behavior, i.e., the way in which people attribute causes. We will also discuss the stronger role of negative polarity in attributing causes, and thus motivate our restriction in this chapter to negative events. When people are asked to attribute causes, they are known to favor the ingroup over the outgroup. For example, in a review study, Hewstone (1990) found that people tend to explain failures of outgroup members - more so than failures of ingroup members - using causes which are abstract, and thus stable, global, and internal. For example, they explain their failures in terms of their lack of ability to avoid the failures (see also Sweeney et al. 1986). Attributing the failure of others to their lack of ability while less doing so with one's own failures is a way to protect the image of the individual self. Likewise, attributing failures of the outgroup to lack of ability while not or less doing so with those of the ingroup can be used as a way to protect the image of the social self. This pattern of attributing the outgroup failures to a lack of ability has been found in a wide range of social contexts, such as between religious groups (Ariyanto et al. 2009), and between groups of different social status (Beatson & Halloran 2013). These studies use methods and tasks in which participants are asked to explicitly attribute causes to in- or outgroup members. This means that participants are able to reason and consider before making a causal attribution decision. This raises the question to what extent the same attribution pattern can also be found outside such conscious control, and thus in implicit behavior. This question can be answered using a referential choice task in interpersonal implicit causality sentences, combined with a group membership manipulation of the protagonists involved in the interpersonal events (the self and another protagonist), as we will do in the current study. To our knowledge, only a few studies investigated the effect of group membership on causal attributions using the referential choice task (Niemi et al. 2019; Niemi et al. 2020). Niemi et al. (2019)'s study shows a massive effect of people's political preference (in this case being a democrat or a republican in the US) on how they attribute causes of positive and negative events to either their own candidate or the candidate of the other party in the context of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections. Niemi et al. (2019) asked Clinton (democratic) and Trump (republican) supporters to read incomplete IC verb sentences involving these two candidates (Clinton + verb-ed + Trump, because...; Trump + verb-ed + Clinton, because...) and to select one of two options (he or she) as most likely next word in the sentence. They used 16 negative and 8 positive IC verb sentences. The choice participants made (he or she) was considered to be their (implicit) causal attribution. Results showed that, apart from an effect based on the implicit causality of the verb, the supporters tended to connect positive events more with their preferred presidential candidate, while negative events were more connected with the other candidate. This finding suggests that people choose the causer of IC verb sentences in favor of ingroup members over outgroup members. The membership of a political party, and thus of the intergroup bias, often overruled the bias offered by the IC verb. This can partly be explained by strongly adversarial and competitive election context in a country well known to be polarized politically.75 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causalityLikewise, Niemi et al. (2020) found that people's endorsement of group moral values rather than their individual moral values led to a weaker IC bias strength in a moral value rating task and a referential choice task. In the moral value rating task, the participants were asked to rate to what extent they consider group moral values and individual moral values to be relevant to their thinking when they decide whether something is right or wrong. After that, the participants were presented with highly morally relevant negative NP1-biased verbs including a \"criminal\" and a \"victim\" (e.g., Bob killed Amy because...). Results showed that the higher group moral rating values the participants had, the more likely they chose the victim, the NP2 protagonist, as the causers in the negative IC verb sentences, and the more likely the NP1 IC bias strength was weakened. In our study, we will use the same linguistic choice task as an implicit measure, but we will include the self as one of the protagonists and use a more subtle context, not based on real membership of participants, nor on polarized memberships like political preference. Instead, we use scenarios in the form of three context sentences preceding the IC sentences, similar to van den Hoven and Ferstl (2018). In the scenarios, we introduce daily life memberships, like being member of the same or different workplace or family. We include the participant as one of the two protagonists in the scenario and the IC sentence, and ask the participant to imagine being part of this scenario while executing the task. For example, imagine a scenario where two competing journals heatedly debated an issue in their column. In this scenario, two protagonists are involved: one protagonist called John and the other one is you. John and you are either from a same journal or the two competing journals. You two involved in an interpersonal event: John criticized you, because.. . You are asked to complete the sentence by making a choice between two pronouns he and you to indicate whether you think John or yourself is the causer of the criticizing event. In Chapter 2, we showed that for the NP2 biased negative verb criticize, people tended to choose the other protagonist, the NP1 protagonist John in this example as the cause of the negative event, in order to avoid being responsible for the negative event and to maintain a positive image of the individual self, due to the SS bias. The tendency to choose the NP1 protagonist weakens the verb's NP2 IC bias strength. Yet, group membership could further influence the pronoun choice and the causal attributions in the sentence. If John is from a competing journal, an outgroup member, you would be more likely to choose him as the causer of the negative verb sentence, compared to an ingroup condition in which John is from the same journal as you. Thus, the NP2 IC bias strength would be more weakened in the outgroup condition than in the ingroup condition. Thus, we expect the IC bias to be affected by the IG bias in the same way as with Niemi et al. (2019): outgroup members are disfavored over ingroup members, indicating that people would be more likely to make more self-serving attributions when the other protagonist is an outgroup member than an ingroup member in the IC verb sentence. In Niemi et al. (2019) as well as in most behavioral studies, participants rely on their real-life attitudes and attribution preferences, while in our case we use a fictitious situation and a less polarized membership manipulation. Therefore, we expect the effects in our case to be more modest and subtle. Unlike Niemi et al. (2019), we select interpersonal verbs with established strong IC bias (as in Chapter 2), so that the influence of the IG bias may show 376 Chapter 3as a weakening or a strengthening of the IC bias. Selecting the same verbs as in Chapter 2 allows us also to compare the results with those of Chapter 2 in this thesis. We will choose protagonists of the same gender and of the same gender as participants, different from mixed gender IC verb sentences involving the two presidential candidates. This is because previous IC studies have shown people tend to choose a male over a female as causer of IC verb sentences in mixed gender IC verb sentences, in particular in negative IC verb sentences (Ferstl et al. 2011; LaFrance et al. 1997). As mentioned before, in this chapter, we restrict the implicit causality effect on the SS bias and the IG bias to negative events. We expect from the combination of these biases relatively subtle effects, which we expect to show up in the first place in negative events. The literature on social behavior offers evidence for a stronger effect of negative over positive events. The effect of group membership is more prominent in negative intergroup contact than in positive one. For example, studies show that, compared to positive attitudes, negative attitudes formed from negative behaviors of an individual outgroup member are more readily generalized to the whole outgroup (Vermue 2019), and transferred towards another member of that outgroup (Ratliff & Nosek 2011). Also, negative intergroup contact increases prejudice towards the outgroup more than positive intergroup contact reduces prejudice (Barlow et al. 2012). Moreover, negative intergroup contact triggers perceived discrimination and anger, and leads to greater collective action, such as protests, compared to positive intergroup contact (Hayward et al. 2018). The stronger effect of negativity in intergroup studies is in line with a widely cited review study from Baumeister et al. (2001). They reviewed studies on the positive-negative asymmetry effect across a broad range of psychological phenomena using measurements such as self-report questionnaires and content analysis of verbal behaviors (e.g., agreement and insults) and non-verbal behaviors (e.g., smiling and frowning). They found in general a greater influence of negativity over positivity. In their view, the stronger effect of negativity over positivity is because \"the self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones (p. 323)\". Although to our knowledge, there is no clear language study comparing positive and negative effects related to group membership, there is evidence that language use is affected by negativity. For example, Albarello and Rubini (2018) have shown that in intergroup contact, people tend to use more abstract language terms to describe threats from outgroup members, a negative outgroup behavior, compared to negative ingroup behaviors. Moscatelli, Prati and Rubini (2019) found that criticism formulated in abstract terms by outgroup members provoke more negative and hostile reactions and prejudice to the outgroup, compared to those formulated in concrete terms from the outgroup, while differences in abstractness did not influence how people reacted to ingroup criticism. In sum, if group membership influences language use, we may expect the influence to be found first and most prominent in negative events. Therefore, in this chapter, we use only the negative IC verb sentences we used in Chapter 2. We consider them more promising than positive sentences in showing effects of the variable studied in this chapter, i.e., the IG bias on top of the SS bias effect. First, we expect to replicate the SS bias effect that we have seen in Chapter 2. In negative IC verb sentences, people tend to choose the other protagonist as the causer, 77 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causalityleading to a weaker tendency to choose themselves as the causer. Hence, as a first hypothesis, we expect to find in the negative IC verb sentences, a weaker IC bias for the NP positions taken up by the self (you) in biased NP1 or NP2 position (H1). Second, we expect people to be influenced by the IG bias, because they disfavor outgroup over ingroup members in negative events. Niemi et al. (2019) found the tendency to attribute negative IC verb sentences to the outgroup, which offers support for our second hypothesis: people are more likely to choose outgroup members than ingroup members as causers of negative IC verb sentences (H2). In the next section, we focus on how cultural background may modify the influence of the IG bias. 3.1.3 IG bias and Culture In our study, we include culture as a variable, as we assume it affects the way in which people attribute causes in situations where they are seen as member of the same or a different group. We consider culture a higher order form of group membership which we implement in our study as a between-subject variable. Culture shapes how people interact with others (Heine 2010). In cultural psychology studies, the motive to protect a social self has been an important topic. Eastern people have been shown to pay more attention to keep a positive image of the social self than Western people, and to keep a positive social relation with ingroup members (Hofstede 1980; Markus & Kitayama 1991). Eastern cultures have been believed to pay more attention to the social self than Western cultures (Markus & Kitayama 1991). This cultural difference in emphasizing the social self may result in Eastern people to be more likely to be influenced by group membership in making causal attributions, compared to Western people. In traditional studies on culture, Western culture is considered as an individualistic culture, while Eastern culture is considered as collectivistic culture (Hofstede 1980; Markus & Kitayama 1991). In individualistic cultures, the self is defined in terms of each individual's unique and distinct characteristics, whereas in collectivistic cultures, the self is defined in terms of affiliations with particular groups (Triandis 1995). When it comes to defining a good self-image, beliefs and expectations emphasizing more individual uniqueness and personal achievement are more important in Western cultures, while in Eastern cultures, a greater focus is put on connectedness with group members (e.g., Markus & Kitayama 1991; 2010; Triandis 1989; 2001). Thus, Eastern cultures tend to focus on the social self, while Western cultures tend to focus on the individual self. Given their emphasis on the social self, members of Eastern cultures can be argued to be more likely to maintain a positive social relation with ingroup members than those of Western cultures, which could lead to a larger ingroup bias among Eastern people than Western people. For example, Eastern people are found to show more tolerance towards negative behaviors of ingroup members, compared to Western people. Chi et al. (2019) found that people from Taiwan, compared to Americans, are more likely to let harm-doers off the hook if they are ingroup members in the workplace than outgroup members. In this study, participants were asked to imagine that a colleague stole an idea from them and later presented it in a meeting, and they had to rate their emotional reaction to the scenario (e.g., After reading the story, I feel distressed ). Next, they read that their manager 378 Chapter 3asked them to take charge of a restructuring project that could affect the position of the colleague who had previously stolen their idea, and they were asked to rate items assessing their revenge thoughts (e.g., I will make him pay ). The whole scenario was manipulated with two group membership conditions. In one condition, the colleague was portrayed as an ingroup member who was not only an alumnus of the same university as the participant but also worked in the same department and shared many mutual friends with the participant. In the other condition, the colleague was portrayed as an outgroup member who did not have the above-mentioned relations. The results showed that people from Taiwan showed fewer negative emotions and were less apt to take revenge in the ingroup condition than in the outgroup condition, whereas Americans showed no difference between conditions. Conversely, though not significant, the descriptive means in the outgroup condition indicated that people from Taiwan had more negative emotions and revenge thoughts than Americans, which may suggest that Eastern people may be less tolerant towards negative behaviors of the outgroup members, compared to Americans. The findings of Chi et al. (2019) suggest that, compared to Western people, Eastern people would more likely maintain a good relationship with ingroup members, by favoring ingroup members over outgroup members and by disfavoring outgroup members over ingroup members. For our study, it would mean that we may observe a larger difference between causal attributions in the ingroup and outgroup for Chinese participants, compared to Dutch participants. Chinese participants would be more likely to attribute negative events to outgroup members and less likely to do so to ingroup members. Evidence for the role of culture in relation to causal attributions can also be derived from the idea that cultures are argued to differ in terms of adherence to group moral values. As mentioned above, Niemi et al. (2020) showed the relevance of moral group values in causal attribution. Graham et al. (2011) have shown that cultures differ in their attitude towards binding or group moral values. They presented a validated questionnaire including three binding variables (ingroup loyalty, obedience to and respect for authority, and preservation of physical and mental purity) to people from different cultures and found that people with an Eastern cultural background are more concerned about group moral values than people from the West. This cultural connection with group moral values is in line with other cultural studies. For example, ingroup loyalty is more emphasized in collectivist cultures than in individualist cultures, because members in collectivist cultures tend to believe some individuals are more powerful than others, i.e., ingroup authorities (see also Hofstede 1980; 2001), and ingroup authorities are supposed to know what is good for ingroup members (see also Triandis 1991; 1998). Hence, it is plausible that compared to people from Western cultures, people from Eastern cultures are more likely to be group-oriented when they judge causal attributions of the IC verb sentences. Therefore, compared to Western people, Eastern people would more likely show a larger IG bias in the IC verb sentences embedded in context where group membership plays a role. In conclusion, we expect that Easterners, compared to Westerners, will show a greater IG bias in their causal attributions in negative IC verb sentences. We expect that compared to Dutch people, Chinese people are more likely to choose the other protagonist being an 79 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causalityoutgroup member, and less likely to choose the other protagonist being an ingroup member. This potential disfavor of outgroup over ingroup would lead to a larger IG bias between ingroup and outgroup conditions among Chinese people, compared to Dutch people, which is our third hypothesis (H3). As we also ask participants to rate their attitudes towards ingroup and outgroup in the GES test (Swart et al. 2011; Wright et al. 1997), we expect that the rating score differences between ingroup and outgroup would be larger among the Chinese participants than the Dutch participants. 3.1.4 The present study This study investigates whether group membership moderates the influence of the SS bias on the IC bias. Dutch and Chinese participants are asked to read and complete negative IC verb sentences. These sentences involve both the self and another protagonist, who is either an ingroup or an outgroup member manipulated in scenarios of the sentences. This means that we expect the IG bias to show as a difference between choices made in the ingroup vs. the outgroup condition and between Chinese and Dutch participants, while two other conditions are the same, the original IC bias, based on the type of verb, and the SS bias, based on the perspective used (i.e., the self either in biased-self NP1 or NP2 position, or in non-biased-self NP1 or NP2 position). Take the negative verbs irritate and criticize in Table 3.1 as examples. Based on the verb type, we expect that participants have strong preference to attribute causes to the NP1 of the verb irritate (John) and to the NP2 of the verb criticize (Peter). Compared to this IC default, we expect participants to choose less the self protagonist as the causer of negative events, because of the expected effect of the self-serving bias: When the self is in NP1 position, we thus expect more choices for NP2, conversely, the self in NP2 position is expected to result in more NP1 choices. Given the effect of the IG bias, we expect a different choice pattern between ingroup and outgroup responses, such that participants choose relatively more often themselves as causer in ingroup responses and the other protagonist in outgroup responses. Finally, given the effect of culture, we expect Chinese participants to show a stronger IG effect than Dutch participants: more self choices in the ingroup condition, less self choices in the outgroup condition.

Each of these verbs was used in two self perspective version expressed by 'you': biased-self (i.e., self_NP1 IC2 verbs). The main sentence was preceded by a scenario in two versions, an ingroup and an outgroup framing, thus resulting in four versions for each verb. We thus presented Chinese and Dutch participants with 16 items, each verb in one of the four conditions, followed by a group attitude rating task. This resulted in a 2*2*2*2 design, with four variables: Perspective vs. Chinese ). 3.2.1 Participants 159 participants took part in the experiment, 84 of them were Dutch people with Dutch as their native language (mean age =20.52, SD = 2.19, 40 males and 44 female), and 75 of them were Chinese people studying in the Netherlands, with Chinese as their native language (mean age = 26.32, SD = 4.30, 20 male and 55 female). Because English is not the native language of Chinese and Dutch participants, we asked the participants to report their English language proficiency on a 6-point scale. The scale ranged from beginning fluency to native fluency (beginning, basic, intermediate, advanced, almost native, and native fluency). Results showed a somewhat higher average of perceived fluency for Dutch participants (Dutch: M=3.70, SD = 1.00; Chinese: M = 3.47, SD = 0.93), which however was not significant (Mdiff = -0.24, t(157) = -1.53, p = .13). Participants were recruited from English-taught bachelor or master programs at Tilburg University. They were offered the option to be paid 5 euros or to be given one participants' pool credit for their participation. 3.2.2 Materials Choice task We selected 16 negative verbs, 8 with a strong NP1 bias, 8 with a strong NP2 bias; 8 IC1 verbs (anger, annoy, bore, cheat, disappoint, irritate, lie to, upset) and 7 IC2 verbs (condemn, dislike, envy, hate, pity, sue, worry about ) were taken from the 20 negative IC verbs used in Chapter 2. As two of the Chapter 2 negative IC1 verbs and three negative IC2 verb had an issue with low bias strength (betray, harm, ridicule ) or with unexpected completions (scold , punish ), we excluded these five verbs and selected one new strong IC2 verb (distrust). Verb bias was implemented as half of the verbs being strong IC1 verbs (anger, annoy, bore, cheat, disappoint, irritate , lie to, upset ) and half of the verbs having strong NP2 bias (condemn, dislike , distrust, envy , hate, pity, sue, worry about ). For each verb, we constructed four versions, based on the main variables of the experiment: perspective (biased-self vs. non-biased-self) and group (ingroup vs outgroup), resulting in 64 items (4*16). One item consisted of a 3-sentence scenario in which the group variable was manipulated, followed by an incomplete sentence in which the perspective variable was manipulated.81 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causalityPerspective was implemented in two versions of the incomplete IC verb sentence, one in which the self took the subject position of the main clause (biased self_NP1 perspective ), and one in which the self took the object position (biased self_NP2 perspective ). Group was implemented in a 3-sentence scenario, differing for each verb and having two versions, an ingroup and an outgroup version (see Appendix 3.5.1 for all scenarios). The aim of the scenario was to picture a negative and conflicting situation resulting in the two protagonists (the self of the writer and the other protagonist) being either part of the same group (ingroup) or part of a different, competing group (outgroup). See the scenario connected with the verb anger in example 3. (3) Your cousin and his fianc\u00e9e are going to host their wedding ceremony about which the two families have many different ideas. In a meeting, the two families come together to settle the differences. You and David are members from the bride's and the groom's families (outgroup)/Both you and David are members from the bride's family (ingroup) . You angered him, because... Each scenario had exactly the same structure. The first sentence introduced a scenario setting which allowed for more than one group to be involved and showed conflicts of goals or competition among two groups. In order to make the scenario story coherent, the second sentence further introduced one detail of the scenario which made the event of the incomplete target sentence likely to happen, either in between groups, or within one of the groups. In example 3, the second sentence therefore refers to a meeting between the two groups, thus enabling protagonists to anger each other during the meeting. The third sentence introduced the group variable. It introduced the two protagonists in the story, the self protagonist (i.e., the participant, you in example 3), and the other protagonist (David in example 3). In Chapter 2, we used the pronouns I and me to refer to the self protagonist in the stand-alone incomplete IC verb sentences presented to the participants. With the addition of the scenario in this experiment, however, the use of I and me would feel weird. So, here, we instead used you as implementation of the self perspective, and asked participants to put themselves in the position of this protagonist in reading the scenarios and completing the sentence. See the procedure for more details and Figure 3.1 for an example item. As to the other protagonist, in order to avoid undesirable gender effects, we always used a male first name in case of a male participant (e.g., David in example 3), and a female one in case of a female participant (Ferstl et al. 2011; Lafrance et al. 1997). Also, we took care not to create syntactic biases or unwanted differences in referent accessibility in sentence 3: the two protagonists were introduced in the same syntactic position as a joint noun phrase (Both you and David in the ingroup condition and you and David in the outgroup condition, see example 3); we also took care to use the same order for the protagonists in sentence 3 as in the following target sentence, as seen in example 3, thus preserving local referential coherence. For the choice task, the 64 scenarios were evenly distributed into four lists. Each list contained one verb in one of the four conditions balanced in terms of perspective version and group. The sentence order within each list was randomized. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four lists with proper names of his or her gender. 382 Chapter 3Figure 3.1 Screenshot of example experimental item, ingroup condition 3.2.3 Group attitude questionnaire We asked participants to rate their attitude with respect to in- and outgroups, so as to check the assumption that Chinese participants would value the ingroup more than Dutch participants. To this end, we used a short version of the General Evaluation Scale (GES, Swart et al. 2011; Wright et al. 1997). The GES is a validated measure testing people's attitudes towards groups. It consists of a group of semantic opposition pairs used in semantic scales ranging from 1 (negative ) to 7 ( positive). Participants are asked to rate their feelings towards different groups on each of these scales. In our study, we adopt four adjective pairs and one pair of nouns and ask participants to rate their feelings towards the ingroup and the outgroup on these adjective pair scales: positive-negative, hostile-friendly , suspicious- trusting, contempt-respect. The participants were asked to rate first their feelings towards outgroup members and then towards ingroup members, so as to minimize the chance of making within group rather than between-group comparisons. Oakes et al. (1994) have shown that thinking about ingroup members (e.g., family) more often results in within group comparisons (e.g., father vs. mother). 3.2.4 Procedure The experiment was developed in Qualtrics. Once the participants started the survey, they were instructed about the goal of the experiment (investigate people's evaluation of scenarios) and were asked to give their informed consent. Next, they were informed about the 2 parts (completion task and questionnaire) and the duration of the experiment (30 83 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causalityminutes), followed by demographic questions (gender, native language, highest education, and fluency in English). After that, they read the instruction of the sentence completion task. They were asked to image that they were applying for a screenwriter job. The core of the task was presented to them as follows: \"Assume you are in a selection procedure for a job as a screenwriter. One of the tasks in the procedure is to complete scenarios presented to you. In each scenario, two characters interact with each other: you and another person, for instance, John. The scenario which describes an event stops abruptly in the middle of a sentence. It is your task to empathize with your role in the scenario and to complete the last sentence with a plausible explanation for the interaction in the scenario. (...) Please remember that you are applying for a job as screenwriter and that you should complete the scenarios in plausible and creative ways in order to get the job.\" They were told that each scenario would be presented on the screen with two buttons below, one for each protagonist. Participants were required to push one of the buttons (choice task), after which the corresponding pronoun appeared in the field where they had to complete the sentence (completion task), as seen in Figure 3.1. Next, they received an example. After that, 16 scenarios appeared on the screen. After the participants finished the choice and completion task for all 16 scenarios, they were asked to think about their most typical in- and outgroup membership (see Appendix 3.5.2 for an example). The following explanation about in- and outgroup was presented, connected with an example they had to give for each group: \"We all belong to various social groups. Some groups are especially valuable to us. These group affiliations identify, in part, who we are... Please take a moment and think about the various social groups you belong to. Which of these groups do you especially value? In the box below please write down a group that you belong to and consider a part of your adherence; that is, a group that is important and valuable to you. We will refer to this group as your ingroup since it is a group you are in. In most cases, a group we belong to may be contrasted to a parallel group that we do not belong to. The group we do not belong to is called an outgroup. Write down the name of this outgroup in the box below.\" Next, they were asked to rate the four GES adjective pairs regarding their feelings towards the outgroup and the ingroup they just selected respectively on a 7-point scales. Finally, they were thanked for their participation, and received instruction to receive 5 euro or 0,5 hour for the participant pool. 3.2.5 Data analysis Data were collected from 159 participants, each presented with 16 negative IC-bias verbs, resulting in 2544 cases. 384 Chapter 3Data exclusion From the 2544 cases, we excluded the data of two participants (n=32; 1,3%), one of which responded in Chinese, the other did not show any variation in referential choice. This resulted in 2512 cases for the choice analysis. Statistical analysis The IC bias scores were obtained by participants' choice of either the NP1 or the NP2 protagonist for each incomplete sentence. For the sentence completion task, a 2*2*2*2 between-subject design- was conducted (ingroup, outgroup), Protagonist (NP1, NP2), and Culture (Chinese, Dutch). The reason we chose a between-subject design is that in this experiment participants had to read and process scenarios before completing sentences, a cognitively challenging task that was much more difficult than the task used in the experiment in Chapter 2. For this reason, the number of items in the experiment was limited to 16 which made a complete within participants design unfeasible. The dependent variables were choice percentages of the two protagonists. 3.3 Results In this section, we first present descriptives of the group attitude (GES) test and the choice task. Then we present detailed results of the choice task: we compare the participants' mean choice percentage of cases in which the self takes up the biased position (biased-self , i.e., NP1 in IC1 verbs, and NP2 in IC2 verbs) with the cases in which the other protagonist takes up the biased position (non-biased-self , NP2 in IC1 verbs, and NP1 in IC2 verbs), so as to compare the relative IC bias strength. We found that the participants tended to make self-serving attributions in the IC verb sentences. Yet, we did not find group membership or culture influences on making self-serving attributions. Therefore, we repeated the analysis, this time not based on the variable of culture (Chinese, Dutch) but based on the scores on the GES, which we expected to reflect the cultural difference we hypothesized between Chinese and Dutch participants. In the GES test, the Dutch participants have a larger IG bias score than the Chinese participants: the Dutch participants were more likely to value ingroup members more than outgroup members, compared to the Chinese participants. This is not in line with our expectation that Eastern people would be more likely to value ingroup members than outgroup members, compared to Western people. Therefore, we further divided the participants into two groups: those who showed a large IG bias score and those who showed a small IG bias score in the GES test, and re-analyzed whether these two groups differed in the potential IG bias effect and the cultural effect. This is to examine whether the participants' attitudes towards in-and outgroup members would influence their attributions in the IC verb sentences. 85 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causality3.3.1 Descriptives GES rating task The participants' attitude toward the ingroup and the outgroup was measured using four adjective pairs taken from the GES. Scores were obtained by averaging the participants' rating on the adjective pairs for the ingroup and the outgroup respectively. The four Cronbach's alpha for four ingroup and outgroup semantic pair ratings were 0.91 and 0.89. As expected, the participants rated ingroup members (M = 5.68, SD = 1.16) higher/more positive than outgroup members (M = 4.48, SD = 1.35), t(156) = 7.72, p < .001. There is, however, an unexpected significant difference between the two cultural groups: the Chinese participants (M = 5.19, SD = 1.24) on average rated the ingroup less positive than the Dutch participants (M = 6.10, SD = 0.88), Mdiff = -0.91, t(155) = -5.34, p < .001; and conversely, they (M = 4.85, SD = 1.32) rated the outgroup more positive than the Dutch participants (M = 4.17, SD = 1.30), Mdiff = 0.68, t(157) = 3.29, p = .001. Also, the difference between ingroup and outgroup ratings, i.e., the GES scores, were significantly smaller for Chinese participants (M = 0.35, SD = 1.98) than for Dutch participants (M = 1.94 SD = 1.58), Mdiff = -1.59, t(155) = -137.41, p < .001. Figure 3.2 shows that the GES scores of the Dutch participants skewed towards the top, compared to those of the Chinese participants. This suggests that most Dutch participants rated the ingroup more positive than the outgroup examples they provided, compared to the Chinese participants. The GES scores suggest that the Dutch participants in this study showed a clearer group distinction than Chinese participants, not in line with our expectation that Eastern people would have a clearer group distinction than Western people. The cultural difference in terms of the GES scores leads us to conduct two additional tests. We first focus on the participants who valued their ingroup more than outgroup, that is those who have a positive GES score. After that, we further categorized this group of participants with a positive GES score into two groups: those who have a relative large score (larger or equal to two) and those who have a relative small score (smaller than two), and test differences between these two groups in terms of their attributions in the IC verb sentences. 386 Chapter 3Figure 3.2 Percentage pyramid distribution by participants' cultural background (left: Dutch, right: Chinese) and average GES score expressed as one of 12 quartiles on a range from extremely negative -5.0 to extremely positive 5.0), the more positive the GES score is, the more favor towards ingroup over outgroup Means of verbs across conditions Table 3.2 shows the choice pattern of the participants for the negative verbs used. In our experiment, the verbs followed the expected bias, though the average IC bias over all conditions (the baseline) is lower than in the study of Ferstl et al. (2011), due most probably again to the exclusion of more cases on their part and the use of a non-native language on our part. The pattern also confirms the SS bias: in the biased-self condition, the IC bias is on average weaker than in the non-biased-self condition, attesting the idea that participants acting as biased protagonist avoid to choosing themselves as causer of a negative event.87 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causalityTable 3.2 For all verbs used in percentage according to Ferstl et al. (2011); the IC bias percentage for Chinese and Dutch participants respectively; the choice percentage in the conditions biased-self (i.e., IC2 verbs), each split up in the two group conditions outgroup). IC Unexpectedly, however, the pattern does not reflect the expectations of the group membership (IG) bias. Participants do not have a stronger tendency to choose the other protagonist rather than the self in the outgroup condition, compared to the ingroup condition, the pattern is even slightly opposite when the self is in biased position (64,4 vs. 68,4). Finally, for some verbs (disappointed, disliked, hate, worried about ) the IC bias effect was very weak or nonexistent. We do not see directly how to explain these preferences. Means of participants across conditions In Table 3.3 percentage scores are given for the participants' choices in the different conditions. These percentages again show the same pattern, with on the left lowered IC bias strength in case the self took up the biased position, and a stronger IC bias when the other protagonist took up the biased position (right part of the table). Differences between groups were not as expected, with lower IC bias in the ingroup condition compared to the outgroup condition for Dutch participants only. 388 Chapter 3Table 3.3 Mean percentage of referential choice of respondents from the two cultures (Chinese vs. Dutch) for the perspective conditions (biased-self, non-biased-self), split over the group conditions (ingroup vs. outgroup) and for the H1 predicted that people would be less likely to attribute negative IC verb sentences to themselves than to others, according to the SS bias. This hypothesis was supported. There was a main effect of perspective: F(1, 612) = 91.562, p <.001, 2 = .130. Compared with the non-biased-self perspective, the participants chose themselves less often in the biased-self perspective. The same pattern emerged in the separate analyses of the protagonists. NP1 biased-self was lower than NP1 non-biased-self scores: F (1, 306) = 46.214, p < .001, 2 = .131. NP2 biased- self was also lower than NP2 non-biased-self scores: F (1, 306) = 45.373, p < .001, 2 = .129. H2 predicted that people were less likely to choose themselves as the causer when they were involved with an outgroup member, compared to an ingroup member. This would translate into a main effect of Group. This hypothesis was not supported. Results did not show a significant main effect of Group: F(1, 612) 0.221, p = .638. There was no interaction between Group and other factors: Protagonist * Group: F(1, 612) = 1.564, Group * Perspective: F(1, 612) = 0.119, p = .730. H3 predicted that Chinese people chose themselves less often as the causer when they were involved with an outgroup member, while they chose themselves more often when involved with an ingroup member, compared to the Dutch participants. This would translate into an interaction between Group and Culture. This hypothesis was not supported. Results did not show such an interaction: F(1, 612) = 1.376, p = .242. Results also did not show a main effect of Culture: F(1,612) = 1.451, = 0.401, p = .527, or any interaction between Culture and other factors: Protagonist * Culture: F(1, 612) * Group: F(1,612) = 0.477, p =.490; Protagonist * Culture * Perspective: F(1,612) = 0.760, p =.384; Culture 1.777, p = .183; Protagonist * Culture * Group * Perspective, F(1,612) = 1.126, p =.289. There was no effect of Protagonist: F(1,612) = 0.507, p =.477, and there was no interaction between Protagonist and Perspective: F(1,612) = 0.062, p =.804. 89 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causality3.3.3 Additional analyses The GES test showed that our Dutch participants have larger in- and outgroup attitude differences than the Chinese participants. This is not in line with our expectation that Eastern people have more pronounced attitude differences towards in-and outgroups. A correlation analysis showed that there is a negative correlation between ingroup and outgroup rating scores in the GES test: the more positive the participants rated their ingroup members in the four semantic opposition pairs, the more negative they rated outgroup members, r = -0.20, p = .01 which confirms the tendency to favor towards the ingroup over the outgroup (Tajfel & Turner 1979; Wright et al. 1997). It is reasonable to assume that the participants who have relatively pronounced attitude differences towards ingroup and outgroup members, i.e., relatively extreme scores on the GES test, would more likely show the IG bias in their causal attributions in the IC verb sentences. Therefore, we carried out three additional analyses. See Appendix 3.5.3 for the specifics of these analyses. We first tested whether we could find an IG effect when we only look at participants with a positive GES score, participants who valued the ingroup more than the outgroup members (n = 118, 75,2%). For the second additional analysis, we divided these 118 participants into two groups according to their scores in the GES test: those who have a large difference between their in- and outgroup scores (large GES: larger than or equal to 2, n = 56) and those who have a small difference score (small GES: smaller than 2, n = 62). Results of these two additional analyses were similar to the main analysis, i.e., there was a main effect of Perspective supporting H1, while no effect of Group and no interaction between Group and Culture, so no support for H2 and H3. Finally, we checked the results of the remaining cases (157 valid participants - 118): the 39 participants who had negative GES scores and thus valued outgroup members more than ingroup members. Again, their results were not different from those of the other participants. Strikingly, among these 39 participants, 32 were Chinese, which may be explained by Chinese participants being students studying abroad, and thus being used to have intensive (and apparently friendly) contact with many types of outgroup. 3.4 Discussion In this study we tested whether being part of the ingroup or outgroup influences the way people make causal attributions using a language task: choosing the most suitable referent for the completion of a sentence with a negative implicit causality verb. We asked Chinese and Dutch participants to make referential choices in such sentences. This study examined the role of group membership and culture in attributing causes in interpersonal events between two protagonists, one of which is the self, The protagonists are either member of the same group or not (ingroup vs. outgroup). We asked participants to choose the protagonist most likely being the causer of the event expressed by negative verbs having a strong implicit bias for the NP1 or NP2 position. Because the intergroup bias predicts that 390 Chapter 3people disfavor outgroup over ingroup members, we expected that the participants would show a weaker IC bias when involved as a protagonist in ingroup interaction, compared to when they involved in outgroup interaction. Moreover, given a more refined social self as member of a collectivistic culture, we expected the Chinese participants to show a weaker IC bias when involved as protagonist in ingroup interactions than the Dutch participants. The findings of this study confirmed the effect of the self-serving bias , in that participants consistently choose less often themselves, as compared to the other protagonist, as causer of the negative events. This is in line with previous studies investigating the influence of perspective on the IC bias such as Kasof and Lee (1997) and suggests that the motivation to keep a positive self-image is robust, regardless of group membership. The findings, however, did not support the expectations based on group membership. The participants did not more often choose themselves as the causers of the negative IC verb sentences in the ingroup as compared to the outgroup scenarios. There are a number of differences which may explain the absence of a group effect in our study as compared to the group effects found, e.g., in Niemi et al. (2019; 2020). First, Niemi et al. (2019) asked participants to make a choice from a third person perspective (Clinton vs. Trump), while we directly included the participant as protagonist in the event. This may have resulted in a strong tendency to keep a positive self-image, so that the self-serving bias may have overruled the intergroup bias. Second, we implemented group membership in the setting of fictitious scenarios, while the participants in Niemi et al. (2019) were tested on their real-life political preferences. The participants recruited around the US presidential election period in Niemi et al. (2019) were either democratic or republican supporters. For these participants, the political group membership could exert a much stronger effect on choosing causers, compared to our study in which group membership of our participants was manipulated by asking them to read fictitious scenarios including a less hostile type of outgroup membership. Third, our implementation of group membership using a three-sentence context may not be strong enough for participants to imagine themselves in the scenarios, in particular because they had to imagine 16 different scenarios. In van den Hoven and Ferstl (2018), a similar manipulation (three context sentences before the target IC verb sentences) has proven effective in influencing the IC bias strength. But in their study, the context sentences were used to violate the basic meaning and assumptions of the IC verbs. For example, when assigning causes to the verb criticize in a sentence like John criticized Peter because, we assume that John is acting sincerely, but in their context manipulation we learn that John is jealous of Peter, which thus violates the normal interpretation and IC bias pattern connected to the verb. In our case, the context manipulation is less invasive, which may explain the lack of effect. Finally, culture did not influence the IG bias in terms of the IC bias strength. We did not find significant differences between the Chinese and the Dutch participants in attributing negative IC verb sentences to themselves when they were involved with an ingroup or an outgroup member, unlike what we expected on the basis of studies like Chi et al. (2019). We did not find significant differences between the Chinese and the Dutch participants in attributing negative IC verb sentences to themselves when they were involved with an ingroup or an outgroup member. Thus, the results do not support that Eastern, more so than Western people prioritize the social self over the individual self when they are faced 91 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causalitywith an ingroup member in negative events, compared with an outgroup member. Instead, the tendency to avoid attributing negative IC verb sentence to oneself regardless of group membership might support the priority of the individual self over the social self. In this way, people could avoid damaging self-image. This may further indicate that the self-serving bias is aimed to protect the individual self instead of the social self. Even if the individual self is in conflict with the social self, as in the ingroup condition, the individual self turns out to determine the causal attribution pattern in negative IC sentences. In this chapter, we only discussed the effect of group and culture on the referential choice of participants. Studies from Maass et al. (1989; 1995; 1996) show that the IG bias can influence the types of causes that people consider, as well as the degree of abstractness they display in their language. For example, they show that people tended to use abstract language categories such as adjectives to describe the negative behaviors of the outgroup, compared to those of the ingroup. In Chapter 4, we will focus on the analysis of completions, and we will take up this issue there and see to what extent perspective, group membership and culture affects the way in which participants complete the IC sentences. A limitation of the study is the way in which we induced the meaning of ingroup and outgroup. As explained above, we explained the notions of in- and outgroup and asked the participants to give an example. An illustration is given in Appendix 3.5.2: the participant chooses family as ingroup and British people as outgroup, which makes sense knowing the participant is not British. Often, however, it is difficult to assess whether they give a clear example. For example, when a participant chooses basketball team as ingroup and football team as outgroup, it is well possible that the participant is playing basketball but not football, but without private knowledge about the participants' life, there is no certainty about that. Consequently, though the explanatory text was clear, we cannot exclude that some participants did not clearly conceptualize the difference between ingroup and outgroup, which in turn may have affected their performance. A second limitation is the use of a non-native language used in the language task. Recent research shows that people experience emotions less intensively in non-native languages, compared to what they feel in native languages (Imbault et al. 2021). Even if they know the semantic meanings of words in non-native languages, they do not necessarily \"feel\" it the same way as they would feel in their native language (Dewaele & Nakano 2013; Imbault et al. 2021; Pavlenko 2008). Garrido and Prada (2021) showed that people rate words of positive or negative valence more extreme and emotional in their native language (Portuguese) compared to English. The use of the non-native English in our experiment may therefore influence how participants felt about the negative IC verbs and may have resulted in an overall weakening of the expected effect, in particular for the effect of group membership which we assume is already overshadowed by the self-serving bias, given the use of the self perspective. In conclusion, in this chapter, we found that when people read negative IC verb sentences involving themselves as a protagonist, they tended to choose more often a pronoun referring to the other protagonist as the causer in the sentences instead of a pronoun referring to themselves. This is in line with the self-serving bias as presented in Chapter 2. Yet, we did not find an influence of group membership nor culture. 392 Chapter 33.5 Appendix 3.5.1 Scenarios Verb Scenario Angered Your cousin and his fianc\u00e9e are going to host their wedding ceremony about which the two families have many different ideas.

Re-analysis 1: positive GES scores only The first additional analysis applied to participants who valued ingroup more than outgroup (n=118, 41 Chinese, 77 Dutch). The results for the three hypotheses are the same as the main analysis with all valid participants. H1 predicted that people were less likely to attribute negative IC verb sentences to themselves than to others, according to the SS bias. This hypothesis was supported. There 95 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causalitywas a main effect of perspective, F(1, 456) = 47.459, p <.001, 2 = .094. Compared with the non-biased-self perspective, the participants chose themselves less often in the biased-self perspective. The same pattern emerged in the separate analyses of the protagonists. NP1 biased-self was lower than NP1 non-biased-self scores: F (1, 228) = 17.992, p < .001, 2 = .073. NP2 biased- self was also lower than NP2 non-biased-self scores: F (1, 228) = 30.331, p < .001, 2 = .117. H2 predicted that people were less likely to choose themselves as the causer when they were involved with an outgroup member, compared to an ingroup member. This would translate into a main effect of Group. This hypothesis was not supported. Results did not show a significant main effect of Group: F(1, 456) = 0.204, p 228) = 0.563, p = .454. There was no interaction between Group and other factors: Protagonist * Group: F(1, 456) = 2.272, p = .132. Group 456) = .031, p = p = .436; NP2: F(1, 228) = 1.082, p = .299. Protagonist * Group * Perspective: F(1, 456) = 1.654, p = .199. H3 predicted that Chinese people chose themselves less often as the causer when they were involved with an outgroup member, while they chose themselves more often when involved with an ingroup member, compared to the Dutch participants. This would translate into an interaction between Group and Culture. This hypothesis was not supported. Results did not show such an interaction: F(1, 456) = 0.926, p .886; NP2: F(1, 228) = 2.288, p = .132. Results also did not show a main effect of culture, F(1,456) = 1.225, p =.269; NP2: F(1, 228) = 0.347, p = .556. Yet, the results showed an interaction among Group, Culture and Perspective, F(1, 456) = 4.264, p = .039, 2 = .009. Further pairwise comparisons showed that this interaction was simply due to the effect of Perspective. There were no differences between the Chinese and the Dutch participants in terms of attributing the negative IC sentences to themselves in either ingroup (p = .154) or outgroup condition (p = .124). Separate analyses showed that NP1 verbs: NP1: F(1, 228) = verbs: F(1, 228) = 8.026, p = .005, 2 = .034. There were no other interactions. Protagonist * Culture: F(1, 456) = 0.077, p = .782. p .265; NP2: F(1, 228) = 0.041, p = .839. Protagonist * Culture * Group: F(1,456) = 1.361, p =.244. Protagonist * Culture * Perspective: F(1,456) = 0.876, p =.350. Protagonist * Culture * Group * Perspective, F(1,456) = 3.692, p =.055. There was no effect of Protagonist: F(1,456) = 0.080, p =.778. There was no interaction Protagonist and Perspective: F(1,456) = 0.741, p =.390. Re-analysis 2: large vs. small difference between in- and outgroup GES score In the second additional analysis, we further categorized the participants who had a positive GES score into two groups, based on the size of the difference between their in- and outgroup scores and tested whether there is a difference between these two groups in terms of making self-serving attributions in the IC verb sentences. Among the 118 participants who valued their ingroup more than outgroup, 62 participants had a small GES difference score (30 Chinese and 32 Dutch) and 56 participants a large score (11 Chinese and 45 Dutch). For these groups, we re-analyzed with these two groups as an additional 396 Chapter 3independent variable, along with perspective and group as in section 3.3.2. The results for the three hypotheses are the same as the main analysis with all valid participants. There was no difference between the two GES groups in terms of the choice percentage, F(1, 440) = 0.054, p = .817. These suggested that the results would be similar to those of the first additional analysis and the main analysis. H1 predicted that people were less likely to attribute negative IC verb sentences to themselves than to others, according to the SS bias. This hypothesis was supported. There was a main effect of perspective: F(1, 440) = 53.793, p <.001, 2 = .109. Compared with the non-biased-self perspective, the participants chose themselves less often in the biased-self perspective. The same pattern emerged in the separate analyses of the protagonists. NP1 biased-self was lower than NP1 non-biased-self scores: F (1, 220) = 20.145, p < .001, 2 = .084. NP2 biased- self was also lower than NP2 non-biased-self scores: F (1, 220) = 34.797, p < .001, 2 = .137. H2 predicted that people were less likely to choose themselves as the causer when they were involved with an outgroup member, compared to an ingroup member. This would translate into a main effect of Group. This hypothesis was not supported. Results did not show a significant main effect of Group, F(1, 440) = 0.244, p = .621; .227; NP2: F(1, 220) = 0.280, p = .597. There was no interaction between Group and other factors: Protagonist * Group: F(1, 440) = 1.526, p = .217. Group * F(1, 440) = 0.200, p = 220) = 0.009, p = .922. Protagonist * Group * Perspective: F(1, 440) = 0.096, p = .756. H3 predicted that Chinese people chose themselves less often as the causer when they are involved with an outgroup member than with an ingroup member, compared to the Dutch participants. This would translate into an interaction between Group and Culture. This hypothesis was not supported. Results did not show such an interaction, F(1, 440) = 0.535, p = .465. Results also did not show a main effect of culture, F(1,440) = 1.674, p =.196. Yet, there were an interaction among Culture, GES group, and Perspective, F(1, 440) = 3.928, p =.048, 2 = .009, and an interaction among Culture, Group, GES group, and Perspective, F(1, 440) = 4.810, p =.029, 2 = .011. We did not have predictions for these interactions and had no explanations for them. Further pairwise comparisons showed that the interaction among Culture, GES group and perspective was due to the fact that among those participants who had a large GES score, there was a marginally significance between the Chinese and the Dutch participants, p = .090, when they attributed the negative IC verb sentences to themselves. These Chinese participants were less likely to attribute the negative sentences to themselves than the Dutch participants. This is not predicted by us and we have no explanation for it. Further pairwise comparisons also showed that the interaction among Culture, Group, GES group and perspective was due to (1) Among those who had a small GES score, in the ingroup condition, the Dutch participants were less likely to choose themselves as the causer of the negative IC verb sentences, compared to the Chinese participants, p = .014; (2) Among those who had a large GES score, in the ingroup condition, the Chinese participants were less likely to choose themselves as the causer of the negative IC verb sentences, compared to the Dutch participants, p = .015. We did not predict these two tendencies and had no explanations for them.97 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causalityThere were no other interaction between GES group and other factors.

There was no interaction Protagonist and Perspective: F(1,440) = 0.851, p =.357. Re-analysis 3: remaining cases Finally, we checked the results of the remaining participants (n=39). Among the 39 participants who valued ingroup less than outgroup, 32 were Chinese and 7 were Dutch. The results for the three hypotheses are the same as the main analysis with all valid participants. H1 predicted that people would be less likely to attribute negative IC verb sentences to themselves than to others, according to the SS bias. This hypothesis was supported. There was a main effect of perspective: F(1, 140) = 29.730, p <.001, 2 = .175. Compared with the non-biased-self perspective, the participants chose themselves less often in the biased-self perspective. The same pattern emerged in the separate analyses of the protagonists. NP1 biased-self was lower than NP1 non-biased-self scores: F (1, 70) = 29.024, p < .001, 2 = .293. NP2 biased- self was also lower than NP2 non-biased-self scores: F (1, 70) = 4.525, p = .037, 2 = .061. H2 predicted that people were less likely to choose themselves as the causer when they were involved with an outgroup member, compared to an ingroup member. This would translate into a main effect of Group. This hypothesis was not supported. Results did not show a significant main effect of Group: F(1, 140) = 0.173, p = 70) = 0.846, p = .361.

Results also did not show a main effect of Culture: F(1,612) = 1.451, = 0.401, p = .527. There were no interaction between Culture and other factors, except Protagonist * Culture * Perspective: F(1,140) = 6.414, p =.012. We do not have an explanation for it.

For the biased- self perspective, NP1 was lower than NP2 but for the non-biased-self perspective, NP1 was higher than NP2. We have no explanation for it. The interaction of Protagonist and Culture was not significant: F(1, 140) = 0.442, p = .507. 99 The influence of group membership, self perspective and culture on implicit causality 344CHAPTER 4 An in-de pth linguisti c analysis of IC verb completi ons102 Chapter 44.1 Introduction In most implicit causality studies, participants are asked to choose one out of two main clause protagonists as the subject of the upcoming subclause, which is seen as the participant's view of who caused the event expressed by the verb. This choice in turn is seen as determining the direction and strength of the implicit causality (IC) bias of the verb. Some of these studies ask participants to just fill in or choose the protagonist in an otherwise complete composed sentence, in which the content of the causal subclause does not favor one protagonist over the other, e.g., by using non-existent words (e.g., because .... is a dax; Hartshorne & Snedeker 2013; Hartshorne et al. 2015). In other studies participants are just asked to complete the sentence (e.g., Ferstl et al. 2011) or they have to carry out both a forced choice and a completion task (Koornneef & van Berkum 2006; Chapters 2, 3 and 4 in this thesis). Yet, strikingly few studies focus on completions, and how they are related to the main sentence (e.g., Kehler et al. 2008, Bott & Solstad 2014; 2021). In this chapter, we focus on these completions. Starting from the corpora collected in studies on the self-serving bias (henceforth SSB, Chapter 2) and intergroup bias (henceforth IGB, Chapter 3), we ask ourselves in the first place to what extent the variables studied in the preceding chapters (i.e., self perspective, group membership, culture) have an effect on linguistic characteristics of the sentence completions, in particular with respect to the type of event chosen and the polarity of the completion. This chapter is organized as follows: in Section 4.1.1 we will present the importance of an in-depth analysis of completions. In Section 4.1.2, we present expectations about the influence of the variables we studied in Chapters 3 and 4 (perspective, group membership, and culture) on completions. In particular, we will argue in favor of the relevance of two characteristics of events expressed in the completions: stability and polarity. In Section 4.1.3, we present expectations about incongruent completions. In section 4.1.4. we discuss some additional analyses about regularities we hope to find in the completion data. In Section 4.1.5 and 4.1.6, we explain the linguistic cues associated with stability and polarity respectively, together with the way in which we analyzed them, both manually and automatically. In the method (Section 4.2), we specify the coding of our data. We present results in Sections 4.3 and 4.4, and discuss them in Section 4.4. 4.1.1 Referential and relational coherence in IC verb sentences In this section, we give an overview of the way in which IC verb sentences are studied in terms of two basic coherence mechanisms in discourse, one which is studied extensively in relation to IC verbs, i.e., referential coherence, and one which has been given much less research attention in IC studies, i.e., relational coherence. When people comprehend discourse, they try to ultimately construct a coherent mental representation of the discourse and to create a situation model (e.g., Zwaan et al. 1995). In doing this, two main types of coherence are involved: referential coherence and relational coherence (Sanders et al. 1992). Referential coherence regards how the anaphoric reference 103 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completionsto protagonists in discourse creates continuity and hence referential coherence. In studying implicit causality, most studies, including our previous chapters, have focused on referential coherence, that is, on referential choices and how variables such as gender, context, and the variables we studied (perspective, group membership and culture) influence referential choices. In this chapter, we study how these affect the way in which participants complete IC verb sentences rather than referential choices of participants. So, we investigate to what extent perspective, group membership, and culture result in typical linguistic characteristics of completions. IC studies using referential choice as basic method provide participants with different conditions for their referential choice. In some cases, participants are asked to choose one of two causal explanations. For example, Semin and Marsman (1994) provide participants with two explanations for sentences (e.g., John blamed Peter; John is the kind of person who helps people or Peter is the kind of person that is helped by people ). That way, the experimental task does not leave room for the participant to choose their own type of event to complete the sentence, nor the type of relation between the IC clause and the explanatory follow up clause. Other researchers use non-descript completions with non-existent words. For example, Hartshorne and his colleagues (Hartshorne 2014; Hartshorne & Snedeker 2013; Hartshorne et al. 2015) use pseudo words like dax or froom in the completions of IC verb sentences (e.g., Sally disliked Mary because she is a dax. Sally disliked Mary because she daxed). Though the influence of the content of the completion on referential choice is expected to be lower, it is still not clear how participants interpret the non-existent words. Moreover, also here, providing the completion prevents participants to show whether and how the main IC clause would influence the relation between main clause and causal completion. In many other studies, participants are asked to produce the completion themselves. Some of them leave participants free to choose the referential expression (e.g., Garvey et al. 1974). In other studies participants are asked somehow to explicitly choose one of the two protagonists before they are asked to complete the sentence (e.g., Koornneef & van Berkum 2006). The completions in these studies are used to check whether the pronoun chosen is congruent with the rest of the completion. If not, referential choices are considered invalid. Researchers have manipulated many subtle things in the text to investigate how the referential choices are influenced in IC verb sentences, for example, IC verb semantics (Brown & Fish 1983; Hartshorne & Snedeker 2013), gender (Ferstl et al. 2011; Lafrance et al. 1997), and social hierarchy (Corrigan 2001; Lafrance et al. 1997). The overall conclusion is that verb semantics is the most important factor in determining referential choices. Other non-semantic factors, such as gender and social hierarchy, have a secondary influence. Apart from referential coherence, the relational coherence between the main clause and the completion offers interesting contributions to the understanding of IC verb sentences. In most studies, participants are provided with the causal connective most typically associated with IC verbs, i.e., the causal connective because. This connective can trigger either a semantic or a pragmatic reading (e.g., Sanders et al. 1992). In a semantic reading, the coherence exists because the world that is described is perceived as coherent. We can make a coherent interpretation of sentence 1: our world knowledge tells us that 4104 Chapter 4falling from a high tower results in being dead. In technical terms: the locution of the main clause connects coherently with the locution of the subclause, which contains the real cause of the event described in the main clause. In a pragmatic reading there is always a pragmatic illocutionary act involved. The because clause in sentence 2 does not entail the real cause why Mary died, instead it refers to the illocutionary act of telling, it tells us the reason or explanation why we know now that Mary is dead, not why Mary died. In many languages these relations can be expressed by different connectives (e.g Dutch omdat for causes and want for reasons). (1) Mary died because she fell from the Eiffel tower. (2) Mary died because her mother just told me. As said, relational coherence is studied less intensively in relation to IC verb sentences. But there are interesting exceptions, like Kehler et al. (2008) and Bott and Solstad (2014; 2021). Kehler et al. (2008) propose that IC verbs involve not only a coreference bias, but also a coherence bias. The coreference bias is the well understood tendency to continue IC verbs using a noun phrase which is coreferential with the biased NP . This bias is used in most IC studies as witness or proof of the bias of the verbs. On top of that, Kehler et al. (2008) assume coherence bias in that particular IC verbs prefer particular coherence relations between head phrase and continuations. Rather than considering the latter bias as secondary, Kehler and colleagues consider the coreference bias as an epiphenomenon of the tendency to create an adequate coherence relation between the main clause and the continuation (e.g., the because subclause). Kehler et al. (2008) show that IC verb sentences and their continuations prefer to have an explanation relation even if there is no explicit causal connective because suggesting such relation. In most IC completion studies, participants are presented with such a connective (e.g., Ferstl et al. 2011; Garnham et al.1992; Mannetti & De Grada 1991). In contrast, Kehler and colleagues (2008) used IC and non-IC verbs in a because condition, as in example 3, but also in a free completion condition, a 'full stop' condition as in example 4. (3) Tony disappointed Courtney because __________ (4) Tony disappointed Courtney. _____________ Results showed that IC verbs in both conditions result in an explanation relation more often than non-IC verbs. IC1 and IC2 verbs triggered similar (>80%) percentages of explanation relations in the two conditions. The IC biases seen in the because condition are highly consistent with those found for explanation relations in the full-stop condition. The results not only confirm that IC verbs have a coreferential bias that leads to a biased referential choice, but also a coherence bias that triggers an explanatory continuation, with or without the causal connective because. Following the ideas put forward by Kehler et al. (2008), Bott and Solstad (2014; 2021) carry out refined analyses of completions of IC verb sentences. They consider the main clause of an IC verb to be underspecified, thus triggering an expectation for a specific explanation 105 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completionsto solve this under-specification and to fill in the empty slot by a specific type of explanation. In their view, different types of verbs have different types of empty slots, asking for different types of explanations, connected to the biased position, which in turn automatically explain and predict the coreference preference. For example, in state IC verbs (e.g., ES experiencer- stimulus verbs like admire, and SE stimulus-experiencer verbs like annoy), the stimulus is considered the biased position. Bott and Solstad explain this bias as the stimulus offering the cause of the mental experience on the part of the experiencer. Causes take the form of a proposition: Winning the competition or making noise can be seen as explanations on the part of the stimulus resulting in the experience of a mental state of admiration or annoyance on the part of the experiencer. This stimulus-related cause typically represents the empty slot in the case of psychological verbs, a slot which we prefer to find in a typical because continuation, which then in turn explains the preference to use the stimulus NP as subject of this because subclause. Bott and Solstad (2014; 2021) offer valuable observations with respect to the correlation between verb types and explanation types. They distinguish three main types of explanations. Simple causes offer direct causes of the event/state of the verb, without any intention on the part of the reasoning subject. For example, making noise directly results in a mental state of annoyance. External and internal reasons always imply a reasoning subject, with the reason being either internal to or external to the reasoning subject. For example, winning the competition is considered by a reasoning subject to be an external reason for the mental state of admiration. Being angry can be an internal reason for a reasoning subject to criticize someone. However valuable these correlations are, for our purposes they do not reveal much information in studying our variables. There is no theoretical nor empirical basis to expect that the explanation type will be affected by the variables we are interested in, in particular stability and polarity. All three explanations can be positive or negative, and can have different degrees of stability. For example, a reason for admiration can be punctual and futile (e.g., having been friendly on one particular occasion) or the result of lifelong hard work (e.g., having worked lifelong for free to help poor children). Therefore, we do not expect the relations between verb types and explanation types to be affected by the variables perspective, group membership, or culture. To sum up, in most studies, as well in the previous chapters, completions are used to check whether they are congruent with the referential choices, so as to ensure that participants not only selected one of two protagonists, but also produced a congruent completion based on that choice. Some other studies provide evidence for the relevance of relational coherence in interpreting implicit causality sentences. In this chapter, we want to add to the understanding of implicit causality by focusing on linguistic characteristics of completions, and how they are affected by the variables we are interested in: perspective, group membership, and culture. 4106 Chapter 44.1.2 The role of self perspective, group, and culture in completions In Chapters 3 and 4, we studied how the variables perspective, group, and culture influence people's referential choices in completing IC verb sentences. In this section, we explain our expectation that these variables may have an effect on the type of event chosen in the completions. In particular, we expect the different types of self and group involvements in negative and positive verbs to be related to different degrees of event stability. Event stability is in the first place related to the time duration of an event, ranging from punctual events (e.g., hit) to events expressing a permanent state (e.g., being a friendly guy ). But, when used as causes of negative or positive events, this time related stability also expresses more or less far-reaching and severe causes for the events expressed in the main IC verb. Our expectation is related to the idea put forward by Semin and Fiedler (1988; 1991) that grades of abstraction in verb types are related to grades of event stability. They argue that in interpersonal events, more abstract state verbs (e.g., like) tend to describe more stable events than more concrete verbs (e.g., kiss). For example, the action verb kiss always implies an invariant physical feature in context (i.e., lips), while the state verb like does not. And the state verb like often lasts longer than the action kiss. Therefore, the state verb describes a more stable event than the action verb. Also, Fiedler and Semin (1988) showed that action verbs and state IC verbs tend to trigger different types of information from the protagonists. They asked participants to read IC verb sentences with either an action verb or a state verb, such as Paul helps/likes George . For each sentence, they asked the participants to write down what could have preceded and might follow the IC sentence. Results showed that action verbs (e.g., Paul helps George ) tended to trigger information about the NP1 in the antecedent sentence (e.g., Paul cared for George) and the NP2 in the consequent sentence (e.g., George will thank Paul). In contrast, state verbs (e.g., Paul likes George ) tended to trigger information about the NP2 in the antecedent sentence (e.g., George encouraged Paul) and the NP1 in the consequent sentence (e.g., Paul will invite George). Fiedler and Semin explained that the IC verb bias directions of certain action and state verbs are characterized by systematic differences of the protagonist implied in the antecedent context. Apart from attributing causes to one or the other protagonist, we will focus on different degrees of stability of the events attributed to protagonists. Take for instance sentences 5 and 6 with completions of the IC2 verb criticize: (5) John criticized Peter, because he (Peter) was late for a meeting. (6) John criticized Peter, because he (Peter) is never punctual. The verb criticize by default expresses an event which can clearly be defined temporally, with a beginning and an end, but the completions differ in event type. The completion in example 5 describes a time-constrained activity of Peter in the past tense, a temporally restricted, punctual cause, whereas the one in example 6 refers to a 'general' characteristic or trait of Peter, using the present tense, a temporally unrestricted, relatively stable one. By producing completions differing in stability, people can manipulate the severity of causes of events described by IC verbs, even if they choose the same protagonist. Compared 107 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completionsto a punctual negative cause, a stable negative cause is more damaging for one's image (Weiner 1985). For example, never being punctual is a negative habit. It indicates someone has behaved and will continue to behave negatively due to this negative habit, a negative pattern that lasts long. In contrast, being late for a meeting is not a habit. The negative action is often interpreted as some incident that happened once within a time boundary instead of lasting long. Such a time-bounded negative action is less severe than a negative habit that lasts long, in terms of damaging one's image. Thus, as a general assumption, we expect that the variables perspective, group membership and culture have an effect on the degree of event stability of the completions. Self perspective The results in Chapter 2 show that the majority of the participants follow the bias of the verb, also when they take up the biased-self position. This means that the self-serving bias is not strong enough to substantially change the bias as far as the referential choice for one protagonist or the other is concerned. But it may well be that within the expected bias of the verb, perspective has an effect on the type of completion event chosen. Once people are involved as biased protagonist in positive events, we may expect them to produce more far reaching, habitual (positive) event completions, while when involved as biased protagonist in negative events, we may expect them to produce more punctual and less severe event completions. For example, when part of a positive event, they may present themselves as being always punctual (Mezulis et al. 2004). When in the biased position of a negative event, they should prefer causes based on events which do not damage their biased-self severely, such as having been late for only one meeting (Weiner 1985). This suggests that in keeping a positive self-image, people prefer to be causers of stable positive events, while they prefer punctual events in case they are in biased-self position in negative events. Also, they are expected to attribute stable negative events and punctual positive events more easily to others (Jones & Nisbett 1987). To sum up, in negative events, we expect to find fewer stable completions in the biased- self condition, as compared to the non-biased-self condition and the neutral condition (E1). In positive events, we expect to find more stable completions in the biased-self condition, as compared to the non-biased-self condition and the neutral condition (E2). Group People tend to favor ingroup members over outgroup members, or disfavor outgroup members over ingroup members (e.g., Tajfel & Turner 1979; Turner et al. 1979). This might mean that in negative events, participants may use more stable completions towards outgroup members compared to ingroup members. Supporting evidence for this idea comes from Maass and colleagues (1989; 1995; 1996). They have shown an influence of group membership based on participants' descriptions of negative and positive outgroup and ingroup behaviors. In two of their studies, they categorized participants of Italian origin into two groups according to whether they were from the northern or the southern part of Italy, two areas that hold negative beliefs about each other (Maass et al. 1989; 1996). These two groups of participants 4108 Chapter 4were first asked to read a scenario in which their group membership was manipulated to be prominent, i.e., a passage describing positive and negative opinions of the other group about their own group. Then, they were presented with cartoons depicting either positive (e.g., helping) or negative (e.g., littering) behaviors associated with stereotypical characteristics of people from these two areas. For each cartoon, the participants were asked either to choose from four response alternatives differing in stability (Maass et al. 1996), or to describe the cartoons in their own words (Maass et al. 1989). For example, for a cartoon showing a negative behavior of a person, the participants were asked to choose one of four negative descriptions with increasing stability, ranging from punctual descriptions using action verbs, e.g, he pulls the shirt of a player of the other team, to stable ones using state verbs and adjectives, e.g., he detests the other team, and he is unfair. Both studies found that people used more stable descriptions when talking about positive ingroup and negative outgroup behaviors. They explain this on the basis of group adherence threat. People are more threatened by stable negative events (e.g., he hates me ) than less stable ones (e.g., he shouts at me); Conversely, they feel more appreciated by stable positive events (e.g., he loves me) than less stable ones (e.g., he thanks me ). Given the set-up of our intergroup bias study (IGB) with only negative IC verbs involved, we expect that participants use more stable completions in the outgroup condition, compared to the ingroup condition (E3). Culture On top of perspective and group, we are interested in whether cultural background of participants might also influence completion stability. As mentioned, Maass et al. (1989; 1995; 1996) have indicated that a potential subtle way to show people's unfavorable attitude to outgroup over ingroup members is by assigning more stable causes to outgroup members and more punctual ones to ingroup members in negative events. This discriminating treatment towards the outgroup might be more pronounced among Eastern people compared to Western people. As mentioned in Chapters 3 and 4, Western cultures have been considered as individualistic cultures in which individuals as independent person are more emphasized, while Eastern cultures have been considered as collectivistic in which connections to one' own group are more emphasized (e.g., Hofstede 1980; Markus & Kitayama 1991). A consequence of focusing on connection to one's own group in Eastern cultures is that a positive evaluation of one's own group is more emphasized among Eastern people. Therefore, in terms of SSB, we expect a stronger self-serving effect among Dutch people than Chinese people, and we carefully expect that compared to Chinese people, Dutch people might produce less stable negative completions in negative sentences (E4), and more stable positive causes in positive sentences (E5). In terms of IGB, and applied to negative sentences only, we expect a stronger group effect among Chinese people than Dutch people, and thus expect that compared to Dutch people, Chinese people may produce more stable negative causes in the outgroup condition (E6). 109 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completions4.1.3 Incongruent completions It is obvious that the expectations above only hold as long as the self is in biased position. Yet, the implicit bias of verbs is a bias or preference, which means that language users not always produce completions which are congruent with the bias. Also, we have seen that specific variables like perspective can change the strength of the bias. In any case, there is portion of completions which is incongruent with the expected bias of the verb. Consider example 7. (7) John criticized Peter, because he (John) hated Peter. Although criticize is considered to be an IC2 verb, the completion considers the NP1 (John) as the causer of the event. All studies show a considerable portion of incongruent referential choices and completions. For example, Ferstl et al. (2011) found that up to 25% of the participants in the IC studies chose the unbiased, incongruent protagonist as the causer of the events described by the verbs. For these cases, we expect an opposite attribution pattern compared to the congruent cases. That means, once participants in the biased- self position of negative verbs runs away from the expected bias, we expect them to use more stable completions (vis-a-vis the other protagonist) compared to the corresponding congruent cases (E7), and once a participant in the biased-self condition of positive verbs runs away from the expected bias, we expect them to use less stable completions (vis-a-vis the other protagonist) compared to the corresponding congruent cases (E8). 4.1.4 Additional analyses In studying completions, we will also analyze correspondences between the main IC verb and the completions. First, we will investigate whether there is a correspondence between the stability type of IC verbs and the verbs in the completions. Second, we will see to what extent there is a correspondence between the polarity of IC verbs and the polarity of completion clauses. Literature suggests that negative vs. positive information triggers negative vs. positive information respectively (e.g., Schwarz & Clore 2007). Third, we will analyze the idea that positivity leads to more heuristic or global processing while negativity triggers a more detail-oriented processing style as proposed for example by Beukenboom and Semin (2006). They showed that positive mood induces a global processing style and triggers more abstract language use in the description of social events, while negative mood induces a detail-oriented analytic processing style and results in more concrete descriptions. Translated to our variables, this means that we have to make the correspondence between the stability and the abstractness of events. Punctual, unstable events, like action verbs are more concrete than stable events (like hate). On the basis of this correspondence, we may expect more stable (abstract) completions in positive IC verb sentences and more punctual (concrete) completions in negative IC verb sentences. 4110 Chapter 44.1.5 Linguistic cues of event stability in completions In our study, stability is seen as a time characteristic of events. The time frame of events can be defined by different linguistic elements, in the first place the verb type. Furthermore, elements in the main clause, the completion subclause, and the scenario (in the case of IGB data) can affect the stability of events. Verb type and event stability Within the completion subclause, the main linguistic element we focus on defining the time frame is the type of verb used. This cue allows for a fairly simple, and even automatic analysis. Semin and Fiedler (1988; 1991) proposed the linguistic category model (LCM) which has been widely used. The model is aimed at studying social cognitive implications of different language categories in interpersonal interaction, thus matching the interpersonal IC verbs in our study as well as the variables we focus on. Depending on the version, the LCM distinguishes four or five classes based on abstractness, ranging from concrete descriptive action verbs to abstract adjective traits. descriptive action verbs (DAV): reference to one particular activity and to a physically invariant feature of the action; action has clear beginning and end; in general, do not have positive or negative semantic valence, e.g. call, meet, kick, kiss; interpretative action verbs (IAV): reference to single behavioral event; reference to specific object and situation; autonomous sentence comprehension; interpretation beyond description, e.g., cheat, imitate, help, inhibit; state action verbs (SAV), as IAV, no reference to concrete action frames but to states evoked in object of sentence by unspecified action, e.g., surprise, amaze, anger, excite; state verbs (SV), enduring states, abstracted from single events; reference to social object, but not situation; no context reference preserved; interpretation beyond mere description, e.g., admire, hate, like, trust; adjectives (ADJ), highly abstract person disposition; no object or situation reference; no context reference; highly interpretive, detached from specific behaviors, e.g., honest, reliable, helpful, cute. The original version has four categories (Semin & Fiedler 1988) and leaves out the in- between category of state-action verbs. This version has been used also to automatically code verb abstractness (Seih et al. 2017). Degrees of abstractness in this model are seen as degrees of event stability, with concrete verbs expressing a time constrained, less durable event, while on the other end adjectives such as lovely clearly describe a durable, permanent event. In our study, the LCM verb categories are used to categorize verbs in completions to study differences in the stability of events produced by participants in the completions. In LCM, adjectives make up the most abstract category. They are part of the be- constructions (e.g., be nice). Be-constructions, can be accompanied by an adjective (be nice), but also a noun phrase (be my brother), or a prepositional phrases (be in a good condition ) (Carlson & Pelletier 1995; Lakoff 1966). Adjectives typically express attributes 111 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completionsholding for a long time or permanently (e.g., He is - always - nice), and thus naturally suggest a default interpretation of a stable situation. There may be differences based on what is added to the be-construction. Some scholars argue in favor of be-NPs being more abstract than be-adjectives: Carnaghi et al. (2008) argue that nouns can be used to categorize people by assigning them to a specific type of person, and therefore represent a higher degree of abstractness than adjectives that denote a person's quality. This idea is congruent with the observation that in specific contexts, be-adjectives can be made time-constrained more easily than be-NPs (e.g., he is always lazy/grateful vs. he was lazy/grateful at that moment; he is an expert/soldier vs. he was an (?)expert/soldier). The LCM has been shown successful in studies with automatic coding. Seih et al. (2017) used the classification and specifications of the LCM categorization and tagged 7489 word forms in their dictionary, derived from 1800 verbs. In the dictionary, words are categorized as DAV, IAV, and SV. They did not code the verb type SAV separately, as has been done in Semin and Fiedler (1988). Also, Johnson-Grey et al. (2020) showed the effectiveness of the LCM dictionary in automatically coding texts from three corpora. They used both the LCM to do automatic coding and asked coders to manually code the same texts, and compared results from both coding methods. Their results showed that the automatic coding results from the LCM dictionary can accurately predict manually coded results, which reached significant positive correlations. Therefore, we will also use the LCM dictionary to automatically code the completions. Finally, the verb categorization in LCM largely correspondents to verb categorizations presented elsewhere. For example, Hartshorne and Snedeker (2013) propose a verb classification based VerbNet, an extensive computational verb lexicon for English providing verb classes as developed by Levin (1993) based on the potential of verbs to be used in a large variety of syntactic and semantic structures. In a pronoun elicitation experiment, they show that the IC bias of verbs can be predicted on the basis of the IC verb's distribution across these structures. The results show a considerable correspondence with classes distinguished in the linguistic category model. They both cluster some psychological state verbs, SAV verbs in LCM, such as anger and annoy, as IC1 verbs and other psychological state verbs SV verbs in LCM, such as dislike and hate, as clear IC2 verbs. In sum, we will code the type of verb in terms of the Linguistic Category Model automatically using the dictionary of Seih et al. (2017) and add the category of attributes semi-automatically by looking at completions using the verb 'be', see Section 4.2.1. Beyond verb type Using the standard verb classes of the linguistic category model is a feasible way to analyze the stability of completions as analysts only have to classify the verbs only. But it obviously does not take into account the effect of the context on the stability of completions. Different types of contextual cues however may affect the stability of completions. These cues are either part of the completion subclause, the main clause, or - in the IGB data - the framing offered by the ingroup-outgroup scenario. 4112 Chapter 4Temporal expressions . The stability of completions can be affected most drastically by adding specific temporal expressions , either making a stable completion punctual, or the other way around. For example, a simple 'punctual' descriptive action verb becomes durable by adding a lexical item like always or never (e.g., You annoyed her, because you always giggle uncontrollably , IGB227; John disliked Peter, because he (Peter) never took a shower , SSB2672). Conversely, adding punctual temporal expressions, like at that time turns 'stable' state verbs and be-constructions into a time-constraint events (e.g., I harmed Peter, because I was angry at that time, SSB2276). Additional/secondary verb forms. The original stability value of verbs can also be affected drastically by adding an additional verb form, like a modal or auxiliary verb (e.g., John excited me, because he could dance , SSB3606; she annoyed you, because she did not like your ideas, IGB176), or by particular aspectual aspects of verbs, for example when a progressive form is increasing the stability of a descriptive verb (e.g., I bored Mary, because I was talking about very boring stuff, SSB5104). The stability also changes by adding an embedding in the completion (e.g., John delighted me, because he said I am a good friend to him , SSB1525), by adding the verb keep (e.g., You distrusted her, because you keep asking questions, IGB1182), by adding 'mentalizing' verbs about thinking, believing, and wanting (e.g., She sued you, because she thought we sang her song , IGB2225; Susan disappointed Mary, because she (Mary) thought Susan would pick her up, SSB4188; John lied to me, because he wanted me to punch him , SSB3269). Ambiguous/figurative verbs. A major challenge for verb-based stability categorization is the ambiguity of verbs. The stability of completions can change drastically depending on different meanings of the verb, for example, when verbs are used in a figurative sense (e.g., break a vase, SSB71 vs. break pro mise, SSB5346). Verb tense. In our experiments we used a main IC verb in the past tense, as it offers the best guarantee for a natural completion (Hartshorne et al. 2015). The past tense indicates that the temporal scope of the event is prior to the time of speaking, while the present tense indicates that it coincides with the time of speaking. Yet, this choice immediately affects the stability of the main IC verb event, as a past tense naturally suggests that the event is not anymore valid at present. A state event like hate sounds less stable in the past tense, compared to the present tense (e.g., John hates Peter vs. John hated Peter). In turn, this decreased stability also decreases the stability of the because-subclause. When participants decide to stick to the past tense, they stick to the same restrained past time frame (e.g., John hated Peter, because he was always rude). Yet, using the present tense in the completion offers participants a way to escape from this past time frame (e.g., John hated Peter, because he is always rude). This turns the use of the present tense in our experiments into a strong indicator of event stability. We expect to find present tense completions to be predominantly related to state verbs or be-expressions (e.g., Susan disliked me, because I am her boyfriend's ex, SSB72). 113 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completionsOur specific experimental situation does not match the expectations about the effect of the past tense found elsewhere. Using the framework of Construal Level Theory (see Liberman et al. 2007; Trope & Liberman 2010), Carrera et al. (2014) showed that past tense sentences were associated less with two variables known to be related to event concreteness (i.e., event probability and event familiarity). Participants who were asked to write in the past tense appeared to use more abstract language, compared to the participants writing in the present tense. We think these results can be explained by the fact that they asked participants to write down personal experiences taking the I perspective of a negative behavior (i.e., excessive drinking), a behavior that clearly threatens the participants' self- image. In that situation, it is likely that participants use more negative-abstract language in the past tense than in the present tense (\"I was/am a heavy problematic drinker\"), as the past tense suggests the negative behavior is a thing of the past, which implies this kind of language is less threatening the participants' self-image. Therefore, their conclusion does not invalidate our expectation. Given the manipulation of perspective (self vs. other) in negative and positive events, we consider the use of the present tense as a clear way to escape from the past time frame of the main clause and to make the event more stable. Thus, in negative events, we expect to see more present tenses in attributions of causes to others; in positive events we should see more present tenses in attributions of causes to the self, congruent with the self-serving bias. Contextual cues. The context of the main clause and (in IGB) the scenario preceding the main IC clause provides additional variables affecting the stability of completions. The IGB sentences were preceded by a three-sentence narrative scenario in the past tense. Each scenario sketched a punctual event that had happened recently. See example 8 for the wedding scenario associated with the verb annoy, together with a number of completions, all from the same biased-self condition, and ordered from concrete/punctual to abstract/stable. Participants have the option to either keep their completion within this scenario, as in example 8a or to clearly escape from that time frame, as in example 8j. The completions in example 8 contain verbs with different abstraction levels: action verbs in the upper part, followed by state verbs and adjectives. Yet, we also see that the same verb can be interpreted as expressing events with different degrees of stability. For example, the combination of the past tense and the reference to the wedding cake makes it likely to interpret the event in example 8e as a fairly punctual event, despite the presence of the state verb have. On the other hand, the present tense and the more vague reference in example 8i makes it likely to interpret this completion as being valid also outside the specific time frame of the wedding event. (8) [annoy scenario] Your cousin and his fianc\u00e9e are going to host their wedding ceremony about which the two families have many different ideas. In a meeting, the two families come together to settle the differences. You and David/Mary are members from the bride's and the groom's families. You angered him, because ... HE] (8a) I acted rudely. (IGB125) (8b) I interrupted every member of his family when they tried to make their point. 4114 Chapter 4(IGB79) (8c) I were (=was) wearing a prettier dress than her. (IGB99) (8d) I didn't take the whole thing seriously and just started doing something else. (IGB47) (8e) I had different ideas about the wedding cake. (IGB6) (8f) I was not willing to compromise. (IGB150) (8g) I disrespected the groom. (IGB40) (8h) I had an affair with his wife. (IGB81) (8i) I have different ideas on the same thing. (IGB154) (8j) I are (=am) assertive. (IGB57) The examples illustrate that contextual cues can alter the stability of events, which is why we not only measured stability using automatic verb type analysis, but also using a more interpretative and global human/manual coding of the durability of the completion, taking into account all available signals. In sum We consider completion stability to be affected by the variables we are interested in (perspective, group, culture, polarity). In our data, completion stability can be signaled in the first place by objective (and to a large extent automatically measurable) cues: verb type, temporal expressions, and verb tense. In addition, we will also carry out a durability coding, a manual interpretative coding of completion stability including all available cues. 4.1.6 Linguistic cues of event polarity in completions The events in the completion can be either positive or negative. Again, the verb is in the first place responsible for the completion being positive or negative. In selecting the materials for the SSB and IGB studies, we have chosen clear positive and negative events. The polarity of these IC verbs has been confirmed with participants' polarity rating scores. In analyzing the polarity in completions, we focused in the first place on the use of negation words (like not and never ) and the use of positively and negatively loaded lexical elements. Negation words have been considered as strong expressions of negativity (van der Wouden 2002). Apart from that, other lexical elements can express positive or negative valence as well, like verbs (e.g., hate, love ), nouns (e.g., enemy, friend) and adjectives (e.g., jealous, grateful ). Different automatic measurements present themselves to carry out lexical polarity analyses (Pennebaker et al. 2015; De Smedt & Daelemans 2012; Hutto & Gilbert 2014). Yet, as in the case of stability, the semantics of words can be overruled by other contextual cues. For instance, a completion such as Susan admired me, because I am never jealous (SSB3891), the negation word never and the negative adjective jealous cannot prevent the completion to have a positive interpretation. Therefore, we also carried out a manual analysis of the polarity of completions.115 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completions4.2 Method In this study, we focus on how the independent variables we studied in Chapter 2 and 3 (perspective, group, culture, and polarity) affect the completions in terms of event stability and polarity. We used a combination of automatic and manual measures. We measured completion stability by automatically coding the type of the main verb (in terms of the Linguistic Category Model), the verb tense and temporal expressions. We manually coded the durability of completions, as well as the verb tense (by way of control). Completion polarity is measured by automatically coding negation words and polarity sensitive lexical elements. We also carried out a manual coding of completions, as well as a manual check of the automatic coding of negation words. 4.2.1 Measuring event stability Automatic coding of verb type. We used a trained English language parser program to retreat the first main verb of each completion: en_core_web_md from the SpaCy software library in Python (https://spacy.io/models/en). The program differentiates content and non-content verbs and retreats the first content verb as the first main verb in a completion automatically. This means that the program does not retreat additional (auxiliary, modal) verbs, but the content verb afterwards (e.g., meet in Susan disappointed Mary, because she did not meet Mary's requirement; SSB306). Next, we used the LCM dictionary from Seih et al. (2017) also in Python to automatically code verb type (DAV, IAV, SV). In a second step, we automatically coded attributes, i.e., all completions starting with the verb be as main completion verb followed by an adjective or noun phrase. We considered the remaining cases (not captured by the dictionary of Seih et al. 2017) as uncoded. Automatic coding of durative temporal expressions. We automatically searched for the temporal expressions typically associated with event stability ( always , never ). Automatic coding of tense. We automatically coded the tense of the first main verb of the completion using two programs: the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program (LIWC, Pennebaker et al. 2015; http://liwc.wpengine.com/) and Python. LIWC is a text analysis program that calculates percentages of language items of different categories in a sentence (such as tense) and presents the percentages of each category between zero and one. In terms of tenses, LIWC yields percentages of words suggesting past tense and present tense in sentences, based not only on verbs only, but also other words suggesting tempus (e.g., now, ago). When this test resulted in a higher percentage of words indicating present tense than the percentage of words indicating past tense, the completion was coded as present tense (and non-present tense in the opposite case). In Python, we used the en_core_web_md program. The first main verb of each completion was coded using tense relevant tags from the Penn Treebank (https://www.ling. upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html): on the one hand present; VBZ_ Verb: 3rd person singular present), on the other hand non-present tense indicators (VBD_ Verb: past tense; (gerund or present participle), NA_NOT APPLICABLE (unclear cases). Based on the tags, the completions were coded as present tense, non-present tense or unclear. Manual coding of tense. Apart from these codings, we used a manual tense coding as well, so as to be able to evaluate the automatic codings in comparison with a more time-consuming but more accurate manual coding. Manual coding of stability. In order to take all completion cues into account we carried out a manual stability coding, which we termed 'durability' coding. We constructed an interpretation frame consisting of two questions to be asked for each completion: (i) Does the addition of the temporal expression always/never result in a reasonable and acceptable interpretation of the completion (always vs. no-always); (ii) does the event of the completion exceed the time frame of the main clause or (for IGB) the time frame of main clause plus the scenario (inside vs. outside time frame), thus resulting in four types of durability (no-always_ inside, no-always_outside, always_inside, always_outside), with the last one combining the two durability characteristics, thus representing the most durable cases. One coder coded all SSB and IGB data manually, after which 6,9% of the data (n=564) were re-coded by a second coder, resulting in a coding congruence of 95,7% of the cases. 4.2.2 Measuring event polarity Automatic polarity coding. We used SpaCy in Python and LIWC to automatically detect negations in completions. SpaCy parses words in a completion and detects negation words (not, n't). We also used LIWC to detect negative and positive words (not, n't but also lexical items with negative or positive connotation). LIWC yields a percentage of positive and negative language items. We checked manually the divergences between the two programs (0.9% SSB; 5.9% IGB). We also calculated the polarity automatically using different lexical polarity indicators. Such an indicator calculates the average of the (positive and negative) valence of words in a sentence, based on a dictionary of words all having a human rated polarity score. The lexical polarity indicator of LIWC contains a dictionary of around 6400 neutral and non-neutral language items with polarity scores between zero (negative) and 100 (positive). As such, the dictionary covers most of the items in our data (SSB: 91.7%; IGB: 91.5%). The LIWC manual does not clearly define positive and negative words, only offers examples (Pennebaker et al. 2015). Apart from that, we used polarity scores taken from the Pattern (De Smedt & Daelemans 2012) and Vader (Hutto & Gilbert 2014) packages in Python. Pattern is based on around 3000 frequent English words with human rated valence score. Vader is a python package with a focus on polarity analysis in social media. It has a list of around 7500 English language items with human rated valence scores. The two dictionaries focus on non-neutral words 117 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completions(omitting words like am, is, on, the, etc.). Pattern covers 17.1% of the SSB data and 10.9 % in the IGB data; Vader covers 22.3% in the SSB data and 13.4% in the IG bias chapter). In order to compare the results of the three programs, we convert all scores to a scale ranging from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive). None of the programs reveal their valence score algorithms. For example, the LIWC manual specifies that \"due to prior commercial agreements, the precise algorithms are not available\" (Pennebaker et al. 2015). So, again, it is difficult to assess the reliability of the automatic polarity scores, which is why we also here decided to carry out a manual coding. Manual polarity coding. We manually coded completion polarity by looking only at the completions, thus blinded from the main clause and the scenario. We coded the completion as positive or negative on the basis of general world knowledge having a positive or a negative polarity, i.e., whether it is related more to negative or positive objects, feelings, action. In the two cases, the main cues were the polarity of verbs (e.g., abandoned vs. promoted), adjectives (e.g., weird, rude vs. brave, awesome) etc. When there were no clear signals of positive or negative polarity, we classified completions as neutral. Some unclear cases remained after this coding, cases which could easily be considered as negative or positive (e.g., are better than her; IGB253); are competitors; IGB631). We considered these cases neutral as well. One coder coded all completions. A second coder re-coded 10 randomly chosen completions per verb (40 SSB, 16 IGB verbs, n=560), resulting in an agreement of 96,5%. In manually coding completion polarity, we did not include the main clause, because we expected the negative or positive event expressed in the main clause to highly determine the polarity of main clause plus completion. For example, an intrinsically positive completion like I won the competition easily results in an overall negative interpretation when it follows a negative main verb (e.g., Mary hated me because I won the competition). Therefore, after the coding, we carried out a re-analysis on part of the data, in particular all cases with a mismatch between the polarity of the main verb and the coded polarity of the completions. As expected, in all cases the overall polarity of main verb and completion followed the polarity of the main verb, r = .532, p < .001. Therefore, we decided to test our polarity expectations on all cases, included the negative completions following a positive IC verb and vice versa. 4.2.3 Data exclusion and analysis Starting from the SSB (n=5680) and IGB (n=2512) data files (total, n=8192), we excluded 39 cases (20 from SSB, 19 from IGB), because they did not offer an adequate completion. These completions consisted of either a verb only (e.g., want; SSB 5725) or no verb (e.g., positive mind; SSB5364), their syntax resulted in an unreadable completion (e.g., lay to Susan; SSB151), they offered a comment rather than a completion (e.g. I do not know what condemned means; IGB655), or they did continue with the two referents together or with another referent (e.g. John married Peter, because Peter and John are gay; SSB4929). The resulting cases (SSB n=5660; IGB n=2493; total n=8153) were used in the completion analysis. We will focus on differences in distribution patterns in the data as a steppingstone for a qualitative analysis of the completions. 4118 Chapter 44.3 Results In Section 4.3.1, we will start with a number of descriptive observations of the completions: differences between the outcomes of automatic and manual measurements (LCM-verb type vs. durability; verb tense, negation, polarity), differences between the two datasets (SSB vs. IGB) and descriptions of deviant completions. In Section 4.3.2 we explore how the variables Perspective, Group, Culture, and Polarity influence participants' completions, in particular the completion stability. Section 4.3.3 offers the results of the additional analyses. 4.3.1 Descriptive observations Automatic vs. manual measures The manual stability coding was not just the manual version of the automatic LCM coding but took into account all possible contextual cues. Therefore, the outcomes of the automatic LCM verb type and the manual durability coding are not easy to compare and may well diverge considerably. Also, the manual coding applied to all cases, while the automatic LCM analysis left 12,8% (n=1044) cases uncoded, simply because the completion verb was not part of the dictionary (nor was it a be-attribute). Yet, the two measures can be seen as having a similar stability ranking: LCM-verbs ranging from action verbs to state verbs/attributes with the category of IAV verbs in between; durability having a low and high stability class with no or two stability interpretation characteristics, and two intermediate classes having only one. Table 4.1 shows the correlation between the classes. Table 4.1 Correspondence between the automatic LCM verb type coding and the durability coding in some correlation, with DAV and IAV being most frequent in the left low durability class, attributes most frequent in the high durability class (right). Note the high percentage (60,7%) of attributes in the no-always outside category. Many of these cases can also be seen as durable, but the addition of always is for some reason awkward, as in example 9. For these cases, the use of always as durability indicator is not optimal. Each LCM category is represented with a fair percentage in each durability category. Strikingly, the distribution of state verbs does not follow this pattern as they are equally frequent in all durability categories. Partly, this can be explained by the contextual elements we discussed above which can overrule the basic class of the verb. But inspection of the 119 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completionsLCM dictionary also shows that verbs are considered state verbs, which clearly describe concrete actions, like the verb buy in example 10. But also, the other LCM categories have substantial representation in each durability category. For example, 10,4% of attributes are included in the lowest durability category. Most of them have adjectives indicating a specific event, as in example 11. (9) You envied him, because he is (?always) much younger and smarter than me. (IGB1367) (10) I pleased Mary, because I bought her a dog. (SSB3370) (11) I kissed Peter, because I was drunk. (SSB4928) Though the two measures show different types of weaknesses and inaccuracies, in particular the strongest cases of the two measures (attributes, always_outside) can be seen as a fairly reliable test of the stability of completions. We will use them both in exploring the effect of perspective, group, and culture on the stability of completions. The tense coding of the two automatic measures deviated considerably from the manual coding. LIWC coded all cases, while Python left out 7% (n=574), because the completion verb was not one of the present or past tense indicators used by the algorithm. Leaving out the uncoded cases, LIWC deviates more from the manual coding than Python (n=960 vs. n=463), both in wrongly coded past (4,5% vs. 1,8%) and present (22,6% vs. 13,8%). A large number of these cases turn out to be completions with auxiliary verbs (did, could, would + infinitive) or embedded completions like example 12. (12) She sued you, because she thought I have copied her idea in her songs (IGB2128) Python coded these cases as present (VB_Verb, base form), probably on the basis of the presence of an infinitive (base form), even if this precedes a past participle as in example 12 (e.g., have copied) or follows a past auxiliary (e.g., did work ). Evaluating LIWC is more difficult as the algorithm is confidential, but similar errors can be found there as well. Therefore, we will only use the results of the manual tense coding in the results. As to the coding of negation, i.e., the presence of typical negation words (not, n't), the human coding resulted in 1054 cases. We added to this list cases with other typical functional negation words detected mostly by LIWC (nothing, without, no one), resulting in a list of 1244 cases we used in the polarity analysis. For the (more general) polarity coding of completions, we used three automatic methods counting negative and positive lexical elements and resulting in a score between -1 and 1 (Python Pattern and Vader) or 0 and 1 (LIWC). We recalculated these scores into negative (the lowest 40%) and positive (the highest 40%), thus leaving out the 20% middle scores, which we consider as neutral in terms of polarity. Automatic and manual codings resulted in more negative cases, likely the result of more of the data being completions of negative IC coding as the polarity standard, the 4120 Chapter 4automatic methods score quite differently in capturing the negative vs. positive completions respectively, the result of size differences of the dictionaries the algorithms are based on (LIWC 80,3 27,4% vs. 58,9%; 74,8%). The data contain a large number of interesting mismatch cases showing that clearly polar lexical items are overruled by the global interpretation of the completion (e.g., ...he didn't want me to have bad impact on our company, IGB1843; ...I hate selfish people, SSB3593). Therefore, we will use the results of the manual coding as main parameter in the polarity analysis. SSB vs IGB We use two datasets coming from experiments with a similar set up: Dutch and Chinese participants are presented with a balanced set of incomplete IC1 and IC2 verb sentences and are asked to complete the sentence. The datasets differ on three points: in SSB the items were presented in three perspectives (self_NP1, self_NP2, neutral) while IGB only has the first two; SSB has a balance of positive and negative IC verb items, while IGB has only negative IC verb items; IGB has an additional variable (ingroup vs. outgroup membership) implemented as a three-sentence scenario preceding the incomplete IC verb sentence. Completions in the SSB and IGB file differed considerably in length. IGB-completions were on average 7,9 words (35,7 characters) long, while SSB-completions were much shorter: 3,9 words (16,5 characters). This is likely caused by the scenario in IGB and the more specific experimental task (i.e., taking the position of a screenplay writer in completing the scenario). Apparently, the specificity of this situation makes participants more specific in their completion as well. The datasets also show some differences in the stability and polarity measures as is shown in Table 4.2, where results are presented per dataset (SSB vs. IGB) and further split over IC verb vs. IC2) and SSB verb polarity (as IGB data is based on negative IC verbs only). As to the stable verb types, there is a varied picture: IGB has relatively more state verb completions, SSB more attribute completions. For the difference in attributes, two explanations can be given: first, positive ICs (present in SSB, absent in IGB) turn out to attract more 'stable' attributes than negative IC verbs (positive SSB: 35,1%, negative SSB, 22,5%). Second, SSB (lacking contextual scenario information) turned out to attract shorter and easier completions than IGB. Using a be-verb and an attribute can be seen as the easiest and shortest way to complete the IC verb sentence, likely explaining the rest of the difference between attribute completions of negative SSB (22,5%) and IGB (13,5%) verbs. The difference in SSB state verb completions does not seem to be related to verb polarity. 121 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb durability (no-always_inside, no-always_outside, always_inside, always_outside), tense (present, past), negation (negation words, rest), completion polarity (positive, negative, neutral), completion congruence (bias-congruent, bias-incongruent) for all items, and for SSB and IGB items, and further split over IC verb type (IC1 vs. IC2) and SSB verb polarity (positive, negative). Note that IC verbs in IGB are all negative. All in the coding of durability : more durable (always_outside) completions in IGB (36% vs. 19,5%), most likely caused by differences in the coding of the two datasets: the presence of the scenario in the IGB offered coders the option to consider all completions durable which were not connecting specifically to the event described in the scenario. For the SSB data, no such criterion was available. Coders had to decide on the basis of the main verb, and a (short) completion, which apparently resulted in less coding decisions for completions extending the time frame of the main verb event. 4122 Chapter 4The distribution of tenses over datasets also shows a varied picture: more present tenses in (negative) IGB completions (41,1%), which may be caused somehow by the more specific scenario and scenario-writer task, while present tenses are more frequent in completions of positive SSB verbs (39,2% vs. 23,2%), which agrees with the idea of positive events being more related to stability signals. There are differences in the percentage of temporal expressions between SSB and IGB, but the overall percentage is very low, as expected (n=2,8%), which makes it unreliable to use it as a representative measure of stability. In sum, the considerable differences between SSB and IGB make it wise to explore the expectations in the two datasets separately. Completion congruence As mentioned in previous chapters, the SSB and IGB data contain a fair number of incongruent referential choices, i.e., choices for the unbiased protagonist. In a manual analysis we inspected to what extent the completions were consistent with the referential choices made. Remember that participants were asked to carry out a dual task: first choosing one of two referents by pressing a button on the screen (choice task) and then completing the sentence (completion task). A small number of cases could be detected as unambiguous cases of mismatch between referential choice and completion choice: some completions (n=290) start with an explicit subject, a pronoun (I/You, he, she) or proper name. Some of these cases (n=22) do not match the referential choice. In example 13, the referential choice (indicated by the capitals in square brackets [YOU]) does not match the subject of the completion (she). We changed the congruence status of these cases, thus swapping 10 cases from incongruent to congruent and 12 the other way around. (13) You envied her, because [YOU] she's better than me. (IGB1330) In all other deviant cases, we decided to keep the referential choice as basis for the congruence status of completions. First, there are cases in which the conjugation form of the completion verb does not agree with referent chosen, as in example 14 where there is disagreement between the choice and the verb form (*YOU/I has). Most of these completions, however, turn out to have an adequate interpretation fitting the referential choice, despite the syntactic disagreement (i.e., you having a view different from his view). Further inspection of these cases of disagreement shows that they are predominantly produced by Chinese participants. Mandarin Chinese does not have tense, which makes it likely that participants made tense errors. (14) He irritated you, because [YOU/I] has the different view with him and both of you insist that your choice is the only choice. (IGB1720) In compound sentence completions we determined the congruence of completions on the basis of the subject of the first main completion verb. Yet, some incongruent cases 123 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completionsare quite similar to congruent cases. A case in point are completions starting with the psychological verb think/thought (n=SSB: n=73; IGB: n=117). Coding these cases on the basis of the subject of the main completion verb is flawless in example 15, as the subject of the main completion verb is the same as the subject of the subordinate verb. However, in most cases (n=172) the addition of think changes the congruence status, as in example 16, where it turns a bias-congruent completion (She worried about me because I could not handle it) into a bias-incongruent one. Apart from the productive case of the verb think, the same happens occasionally with other verbs as well, as in example 17, where a bias-congruent reading (I amazed Mary because I was reconciled to Susan) is changed by the subject of the main completion verb (Mary not expecting I was reconciled ). (15) You condemned Jack, because [JACK] thinks he is the only person that needs help, whilst a lot of people are worse than him. (IGB682) (16) She worried about you/me, because [SHE] thinks I could not handle it. (IGB2504) (17) I amazed Mary, because [MARY] did not expect I was reconciled to Susan. (SSB361) Finally, the manual analysis resulted in many completions (n=659) considered as unusual or deviant. Consider the examples 18 to 21, all from the same IC1 verb anger. (18) Susan angered Mary, because [MARY] forgot her birthday. (SSB781) (19) John angered me, because [I] am late for the movie (SSB2221) (20) John angered me, because [I] broke his cup (SSB2741) (21) You angered Nancy, because [NANCY] didn't want to give in to the other family, while you were willing to let the other family lead the way on some aspects of ceremony. (IGB36) In all these cases, participants made the bias-incongruent NP2 referential choice. The completions contain different indications consistent with that referential choice: the content of all completions which matches the referential choice, the syntactic agreement (I am) in example 19, the reference to his cup in example 20, and the two considerations (Nancy vs. you) in example 21. Yet, the completions are unusual as they do not offer the cause for the NP2 protagonist to be angered by the NP1 but the other way around: the cause for the NP1 to anger NP2, hence the incongruence of these cases. Two explanations can be given for these cases. First, perhaps they result from the misinterpretation of the IC verb. It is striking that these bias-incongruent cases are frequent only in a number of NP1 verbs (amazed, amused, angered, attracted, charmed, delighted, disappointed, fascinated, pleased), while they are very rare in NP2 verbs. The past tense of these verbs is identical to a (high frequency) adjective (amazed, delighted, fascinated, ...). Participants may have confused the active reading of the verb with the adjective or passive reading (e.g., Susan angered Mary \u2014> Susan was angered by Mary). In such interpretation, the cases cannot be considered valid completions of the IC verb. Another explanation, however, is based on the notion of intentionality and makes these cases valid incongruent cases. All these cases become valid incongruent cases when we interpret them as the NP1 deliberately carrying out the act of the IC verb because something 4124 Chapter 4about NP2 has happened in the past. Adding the word 'deliberately' to the main sentence gives these sentences an adequate interpretation, see e.g., example 18: Susan deliberately angered Mary, because Mary forgot her birthday. Though one would expect a past perfect in such an interpretation (Mary had forgotten her birthday ), the intentionality interpretation is likely, as most of the cases occur with Chinese participants (29.5%) being less tense sensitive. In sum, determining the subject referent in completions (i.e., the completion choice) is less straightforward than determining the referential choice. On the basis of the presence of an explicit subject referent, we can unambiguously detect a small number of completion choices differing from the referential choice (n=22). For all other special cases (verb agreement, compound sentence completions and intentionality cases), we stuck to the referential choice, as this always matched with one possible completion interpretation. Therefore, the percentage of incongruent completions in Table 4.2 (20,6%) is nearly identical to the percentage of incongruent referential choices. 4.3.2 Exploring the expectations Table 4.3 shows the results of the main stability variables in congruent completions following positive SSB verbs, negative SSB verbs and negative IGB verbs for the main independent variables perspective , culture, and group. As to the effect of perspective, in the biased-self condition we expected to find more stable completions in positive events (E2) and less stable completions in negative events (E1), compared to non-biased-self and the neutral condition. Table 4.3 shows four significant differences, one running counter E2: less attributes in positive biased-self completions (26,9%), three consistent with E1: Less attributes in SSB negative biased-self completions (16,9%); and less durable completions in both SSB and IGB negative biased-self completions (12,1%; 30,6%), compared to biased-other (and neutral) completions. As in the case of the referential choice, the effect of perspective also here shows up in negative verbs. State verbs do not differ. Present tenses only show one significant difference: they are less frequent in neutral SSB completions compared to biased-self and biased-other conditions.125 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completionsTable 4.3 Mean percentages of congruent completions in the three perspective conditions (biased-self, biased-other, neutral), the two culture conditions (Chinese, Dutch) and the two group conditions (ingroup, outgroup) for the main stability variables: LCM state LCM attributes (attr), (positive verbs, negative verbs); bottom: IGB (negative verbs). Perspective Culture Group Self Other Neutral Chinese Dutch In Out SSB-positive IC verbs n= 707 assumed differences between individualistic and collectivistic cultures, we expected Dutch, as compared to Chinese participants to produce more stable completions following positive verbs (E5) and less stable completions following negative verbs (E4). As in the case of perspective, the results of positive verbs do not differ significantly, only tense shows an opposite effect (fewer present tenses, 29,5%). For negative verbs, durability and tense show the expected difference: less durable and present tense both in SSB (12,5%; 14,3%) and IGB (31,0%; 30,1%). On the other hand, one more negative result runs counter the expectation: Dutch participants produce more stable attributes (23,8%) following negative verbs than Chinese. In sum, again more confirmation of the expectations in the case of negative verbs. The consistent difference in terms of tense should be interpreted carefully, given the observation we described above: Chinese does not have tense, which is why Chinese participants in some cases intend to use an infinitive form which can more easily be interpreted as a present tense. We expected participants to produce more stable completions following negative IGB verbs in the outgroup condition compared to the ingroup condition (E3). The results however do not show significant differences between the two groups in Table 4.3. Finally, we expected Chinese participants to show a stronger group effect. Applied to the negative IGB data, we thus expected that compared to Dutch people, Chinese people 4126 Chapter 4may produce more stable causes in the outgroup condition (E6). Congruent with E6, in the outgroup condition, Chinese participants produced more durable completions than Dutch participants (41,4% vs. 30,7%), as well as more present tenses (47,2% vs. 29,5%). LCM types 16,9% vs. 11,6%). 4.3.3 Incongruent completions Once participants choose not to follow the bias of the main verb in completing the sentence, we expected them to show a pattern opposite to what they do in congruent cases: in the biased- self condition of positive and negative verbs, we expect them to produce less (E8) and more (E7) stable completions respectively, compared to the congruent cases. Table 4.4 compares the biased-self results of congruent and incongruent cases. All percentages of incongruent cases are higher than the congruent cases, which offers support for E7 only, and again shows the results are more benevolent for the expectations on negative verbs than positive verbs. Table 4.4 Mean percentages of incongruent and congruent completions in biased-self perspective condition, for the stability variables: LCM state verbs (SV), LCM attributes (attr), 4.3.4 Additional analyses Correspondence stability main IC verb - completion. We were interested to know to what extent the stability of a main IC verb would correspond to the stability of the completion. To that end, we first coded the 41 SSB/IGB verbs in terms of the LCM dictionary we used 127 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completionsto analyze completions (Seih et al. 2017), resulting in DAV, 9 IAV, 21 SV verbs and 6 verbs missing. Table 4.5 (left) shows the completion stability variables for the remaining 35 main verbs. Three of four stability variables show higher stability for SV main verbs compared to DAV/IAV verbs. The number of SV completions, however, shows an opposite pattern. The LCM coding of the SSB/IGB verbs revealed part of the reason of this inconsistency. Seih et al. (2017) did not include the state-action (SAV) verb class, being verbs which can be considered partly state, partly action. In their original interpretation, SAV verbs are verbs \"as IAV, no reference to concrete action frames but to states evoked in object of sentence by unspecified action\" (Semin & Fiedler 1991, p.5). On the basis of this definition, we can categorize 14 SSB/IGB verbs as SAV verbs. Four of these verbs are included in the dictionary of Seih, et al. as IAV verbs (annoy attract bore fascinate), nine as SV (amaze amuse anger delight disappoint excite irritate please upset), one is missing. Yet, this redistribution is not convincing, as many of these SV verbs can also be interpreted as applying to a specific concrete action resulting in a very time limited mental state. For example, anger could lead to a time limited mental state as annoy, due to a specific concrete negative action from a protagonist: John annoyed/angered Peter, because he (John) broke his bike . Table 4.5 Mean percentages of the main stability variables: LCM state verbs (SV), LCM attributes (attr), the highest durability category (always_outside) and present tense for the main IC verbs (SV vs DAV/IAV) from the Seih et al. LCM dictionary (left) and for the 10 most typical SV and DAV/IAV verbs (right). 29,9 48,8 28 Therefore, we also analyzed the correspondence between main IC verb and completion omitting all SAV cases, thereby taking only the 10 most clear SV verbs on the one hand (admire cherish dislike envy hate love respect treasure value worry) and the 10 most clear DAV/IAV verbs on the other (congratulate kiss lie marry scold thank harm punish reward ridicule ). As expected, the results in Table 4.5 show a stronger difference picture for the three other variables, and the same odd result for the SV completions. Correspondence polarity IC verbs - completion. Literature suggests that negative vs. positive information triggers negative vs. positive information respectively (e.g., Schwarz & Clore 2007). Table 4.2 shows convincing evidence for that: Negation words more often occurred after negative IC verbs than after positive IC verbs (SSB 18,4%/IGB 27,4% vs. SSB 1,4%). 84,7% vs. SSB vs SSB 5,2%). The negative verb envy is exceptional in that it is completed predominantly (67,7%) using positive completions. The explanation is simple: we mostly envy people because they 4128 Chapter 4have positive characteristics. Yet, the negative polarity of the main verb makes the whole sentence negative. The same holds for all other occasional cases of negative completions of positive verbs (e.g., Susan delighted me, because I was sad; SSB325) and vice versa (e.g., Susan envied me, because I did better than her on the exam; SSB73). Correspondence polarity - stability. Finally, we explored to what extent positivity leads to more heuristic or global processing while negativity triggers a more detail-oriented processing style (Beukenboom & Semin 2006). On the basis of this idea, we expected more stable (abstract) completions in positive IC verb sentences and more punctual (concrete) completions in negative IC verb sentences. The polarity distribution in the SSB data in Table 4.2 largely confirms this idea: attributes (35,1% vs. 22,5%), tenses vs. 23,2%) are more frequent following positive IC verbs. 4.4 Discussion In this chapter, we explored completions produced in the two experiments we described in Chapter 2 (SSB) and Chapter 3 (IGB). The main goal was to discover the effect of perspective, culture, and group on the way in which participants completed sentences. In Chapter 2 and 3, the results were based on the participants' choice for one or the other protagonist. Overall, the effect of our three main variables on referential choice was weak, with no effect for group membership and culture, and only the expected effect of perspective for negative IC verbs. Therefore, in this chapter, we wanted to know whether we can find more subtle effects, not in terms of referential choice, but in terms of linguistic cues in completions. As to the role of perspective, we expected fewer stable completions in positive events (E1) and more stable completions in negative events (E2). The results of the LCM verb analysis (especially attributes), durability and tense largely supported the expectation in negative events, but not in positive events. For negative events, our results are in line with the classic attribution theory which proposes that people do not tend to attribute stable negative causes to themselves (e.g., Weiner 1985): perspective influences not only referential choice, but also the stability as indicated by linguistic cues in completions. For positive events, our results are not line with the meta-analysis in Mezulis et al. (2004) showing that people tend to attribute stable positive events to oneself. Mezulis et al. reviewed social behavior studies in which participants were asked to choose one out of four causes: ability, luck, efforts, and task difficulty. In these studies, choosing ability (as compared to e.g., good luck) is considered a stable cause. Apparently, such an experimental setting leads participants to choose easily for ability in case of positive events. In our study, the connection with the self is less direct, and the range of possible completion events much more varied. This indirectness may have led to a lack of effect on this point. The stronger tendency of participants not to blame themselves as compared to the weaker tendency to credit themselves is in full agreement with the more general idea found in many psychological studies that negative events appear to elicit more physiological, affective, cognitive, and behavioral activity and prompt more cognitive analysis than neutral or positive events (e.g., Taylor 1991).129 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completionsBased on studies from Maass and colleagues (1989; 1995; 1996), we expected that in negative events, participants to use more stable completions in the outgroup condition, compared to the ingroup condition (E3). This expectation, however, is not supported by the data. We did not find stability differences in terms of the LCM verb, durability and present tense analyses, which means group membership did not influence completion stability. For the lack of effect on completion stability, the same explanation can be given as for the lack of effect on referential choice, i.e., the less intrusive, direct and 'real' way we used to implement group membership in the experiment. Unlike Maass et al., we used imaginary scenarios rather than real characteristics of participants, and asked participants to imagine a large number of different situations. We expected Dutch people to show a stronger self-serving bias than Chinese people (lower stability in negative events E4, higher stability in positive events E5). We also expected Chinese participants to produce more stable negative completions in the outgroup condition (E6). The expectations are based on classic culture studies such as Hofstede (1980) and Markus and Kitayama (1991) claiming that 'collectivistic' Eastern people pay more attention to keep a positive evaluation of their own group than 'individualistic' Western people. Therefore, Eastern people focus more on group membership than Western people. Applied to the negative events in the IGB data, we may expect Chinese participants to produce more stable negative completions to outgroup members, compared to Western people. As expected in E4, the Chinese participants used less durable and less present tense completions in the negative verbs, compared Dutch participants. As to the percentage of present tenses, we have to take into account the fact that the higher percentage of present tenses in Chinese participants is partly due to Chinese participants more often using an infinitive in their completions, which is often identical to a present tense. Their native language lacks the morphological inflection of tense as we know it in English or Dutch. This makes present tense as an analytical cue unreliable. Yet, the same pattern also appeared in durability. Together, they may suggest support to the cultural differences that Chinese participants produce fewer stable negative completions, compared to Dutch participants. For positive verbs, we did not find differences between the two cultural groups in positive verbs in LCM verb analysis, durability, and tense. In terms of group membership, our results suggest support that in the outgroup condition of negative events, Chinese participants produce more durable completions and to use more present tense, compared to Dutch participants (E6). Similar to E4, however, we did not find differences in terms of the LCM verb distribution. As to the additional analysis, we found a correspondence between the stability type of the main verb and completions. State main verbs tended to trigger more stable completions: more attributes, more durable completions, more present tenses. This suggests that stability is indeed an important factor that influences how people interpret (both comprehend and produce) the IC verb sentences. Similarly, we found a huge confirmation as predicted by Schwarz and Clore 2007: more negative completion elements following a negative main verb, more positive completion elements following a positive verb. We also found clear evidence that polarity is not a matter 4130 Chapter 4of negation words nor negative lexical items. In fact, all intrinsically positive completions of negative verbs turn out to be negative (as demonstrated in the case of the main verb envy ), showing the huge effect of context on polarity. Finally, we found overall more stable completions in positive verbs, compared to negative verbs, in line with that positivity leads to more heuristic or global processing while negativity triggers a more detail-oriented processing style (Beukenboom & Semin 2006). Positive IC verbs triggered more completions describing stable/abstract positive characteristics of a protagonist, while negative IC verbs tended to trigger more completions describing concrete/detailed/punctual negative events of a protagonist. Methodologically, we tested different ways to measure stability and polarity of completions and found fairly huge differences in the automatic and manual measures used. Overall, we detected that measures based on single lexical items were often overruled by contextual elements. In particular, the LCM analysis using three verb categories (i.e., DAV, IAV, SV) has proven to be not so reliable, partly because of the reasons we listed above (ambiguity of verbs, figurative use etc.), partly also because of the redistribution of the missing verb category (i.e., SAV) over IAV and SV verbs. We also observed problems in the automatic analysis of polarity, for example in handling cases with two negative items (like in Susan admired me, because I am never jealous; SSB3891). The negation word together with the negative lexical adjective jealous makes the complete sentence positive. The three software programs coded this example differently, only Vader coded the completion correctly. Vader (Hutto & Gilbert 2014) examines tri-grams (three-word sequence) preceding a polarity-laden lexical item to decide whether the polarity of a sentence is flipped by a negation word. In our completion example, the negation word never is within the tri-gram before the negative lexical item jealous , thus resulting in a correct decision. Yet, once negative words are outside this range, Vader cannot solve it correctly (as e.g., in ... because she didn't want to be punished; SSB6109). We also found out that experimental conditions can have a huge influence on the way in which participants complete sentences. The more specific IGB task (imaging a screenplay writing task) together with the scenarios resulted in longer and more specific completions, compared to the SSB completions. This specificity in the IGB data more likely resulted in IGB completions more often being interpreted as durable, as is seen in Table 4.2. Indirectly it also underlines the idea of context being important in interpreting IC verbs, as has been shown in the set up of experiments like van den Hoven & Ferstl (2018). Unlike most other IC studies, we did not exclude incongruent completions, known to represent up to 25% of the data, even in case of strong IC verbs (Ferstl et al. 2011). Instead, we showed that these completions simply follow the same pattern of avoidance: once participants in biased-self position decide not to follow the IC bias of negative verbs, they display again more stability related cues towards the other protagonist. To conclude, in this chapter, we explored completions in the sentence completion tasks in Chapter 2 and 3. Compared to IC studies which focus only on referential choice, the analysis of completions offers a more varied and dimensional palette of stability and polarity cues supporting the idea of participants avoiding discrediting themselves when 131 An in-depth linguistic analysis of IC verb completionsthey are asked to complete IC verb sentences. Moreover, we found that Chinese participants tended to produce less stable negative completions than Dutch participants, suggesting that the Chinese participants were less likely to make self-serving completions than Dutch participants. Furthermore, we found that the Chinese participants tended to produce more stable negative completions in the outgroup condition of negative events, compared to the Dutch participants, suggesting that the Chinese participants were more likely to disfavor outgroup members than the Dutch participants and had a stronger intergroup bias than the Dutch participants. The human coding of stability and polarity have been proven more reliable than automatic coding. 455CHAPTER 5 Implicit causality and sentence structure in Mandarin Chinese 134 Chapter 55.1 Introduction This chapter investigates whether and how sentence structure influences the bias of implicit causality verbs. To that end, we are using a syntactic variation which is typical in Mandarin Chinese: the variation between a direct object NP in a subject verb object (SVO) structure and an NP preceded by a so-called co-verb in a subject co-verb object verb (SCOV) structure. Examples 1 and 2 show the two structures, illustrated with the verb kill . subject co-verb object verb + perfect object (1) + Zhangsan sha hai + le Lisi John kill + perf Peter (2) + Zhangsan ba Lisi sha hai + le John ba Peter kill + perf 'John killed Peter' The co-verb ba most typically represents this structure. The ba-construction is one of the most studied syntactic structures in Mandarin Chinese (e.g., Li & Thompson 1974; 1987; Fong 2015; Sybesma 1999; Ziegeler 2000; Zhao 2021). The structure is also used in recent studies on implicit causality (IC) sentences (Cheng & Almor 2017a; Zhan et al. 2020). Yet, thus far, the dominant interpretation of the syntactic object position in the ba- construction as being more prominent than the direct object position in the SVO structure does not converge with the data coming out of these IC studies. Therefore, in this chapter, we will investigate the difference between SVO and SCOV structures in two types of implicit causality verbs, IC1 and IC2 verbs using a completion task with an explanatory connective and an ambiguous pronoun. In this section, we will first discuss ways in which syntax can influence reference resolution (Section 5.1.1). After that we discuss the co-verb construction in Chinese (Section 5.1.2) and how it is used in IC studies (Section 5.1.3). Section 5.2 introduces our study, presents the method (Section 5.2) and the results (Section 5. 3). Section 5.4 concludes the chapter. 5.1.1 Reference resolution: the role of semantics and syntax As has been explained in Chapter 1, Implicit causality has been studied widely from a semantic perspective (e.g., Au 1986; Brown & Fish 1983; Rudolph & F\u00f6rsterling 1997; and others). Based on traditional semantic theories, researchers have categorized implicit causality verbs into different types, with mental verbs being the most important for our purposes. A mental verb expresses a mental action or state. 135 Implicit causality and sentence structure in Mandarin Chinese (3) John respected Peter, because he... (4) John frightened Peter, because he... For example, in example 3, respect is an experiencer-stimulus (ES) verb, in which the stimulus, Peter, is more likely to be the causer of the event as Peter is considered the stimulus for John to experience an attitude of respect. Hence, respect is an IC2 verb. Likewise, in example 4, frighten is a stimulus-experiencer (SE) verb, in which the stimulus John is more likely to be the causer of the event (and thus it is an IC1 verb). Researchers have shown that the thematic roles of these verbs are an important indicator of the direction of the bias. Apart from that, world knowledge related factors, like social status, social position or gender play a role as well (Niemi et al. 2020; Pickering & Majid 2007; Corrigan 2001; Lafrance et al. 1997). These findings have led to the notion that implicit causality is a probabilistic phenomenon, influenced by people's world knowledge associated with verb events, along with the verb's semantics. In this chapter we investigate the role of syntactic structure on the causality bias of IC verbs. It is well-known that syntactic variables have their influence on the resolution of reference. There is early evidence of several syntactic sources of information playing their part in the resolution of reference. Sheldon (1974) showed that parallelism in syntactic function influences pronoun resolution: subjects of a clause preferentially refer to subjects of the previous clause, objects to objects. Subjecthood is another syntactic variable affecting reference resolution: Hobbs (1979) and many other researchers showed that the special status of subjects of sentences makes them more eligible as referents of upcoming pronouns than objects. First mention is another structural variable affecting reference resolution: first-mentioned referents are more available for re-mention than other entities (e.g., Gernsbacher 2013). In examples 1 and 2, these three sources are all present though they are not strong enough in example 1 to resist the IC2 bias of the IC2 verb respect . There are basically two ways in which syntactic and other factors show their influence on reference resolution: they can either determine which referent will be mentioned next, or which type of referential expression is used to address the intended referent (a pronoun or a nominal anaphoric expression). In studies on reference resolution using sentence completion as an experimental task, participants can be provided with a pronoun prompt or a free prompt (e.g., Kaiser et al. 2011; Kehler et al. 2008). The results of the former offer evidence on the choice of referent which participants consider to be the most natural continuation; in the free prompt condition, participants can use either a noun or a pronoun (or an expression other than that) which allows researchers not only to consider the choice of the referent, but also the form of the referential expression. In our study, we consider referential choice (and thus the pronoun prompt method) the most straightforward and unambiguous way to test the implicit causality strength of IC sentences. Many studies compare the relative effect of syntactic variables and other (mostly semantic) factors, using structures with natural variation of order or syntactic function, like sentences in the active vs. the passive voice (e.g., Au 1986; Brown & Fish 1983; Rosa & Arnold 2017; J\u00e4rvikivi et al. 2017, Vogels et al. 2013; Kehler et al. 2008; Kaiser et al. 2011). For example, Brown and Fish (1983) studied whether the bias direction of a verb would 5136 Chapter 5change in passive sentences. Participants read both active and passives sentence (e.g., Ted likes Paul vs. Paul is liked by Ted), and were asked to indicate how likely it is that Paul or Ted caused the event. Brown and Fish showed that causal ratings in the passive sentences were not significantly different from those of active sentences and, therefore, concluded that surface grammatical roles do not affect the implicit causality bias. More recent studies show that syntactic cues can influence the choice of the type of referential expressions (pronominal vs. nominal). Rosa and Arnold (2017) carried out three experiments using a production paradigm, and two versions of the standard story- completion paradigm, and they investigated to what extent syntactic functions and thematic roles influence the form of anaphoric expressions (pronouns vs. nouns). They used transfer verbs, goal-source (e.g., get, receive , and take ) and source-goal verb (e.g., give, hand , and send) sentences. In the production study, the stimuli were pairs of pictures and sentences describing the first of each pair in either a goal-source (e.g., Sir Barnes got a backrub from Lady Mannerly) or a source-goal format (e.g., Lady Mannerly gave a backrub to Sir Barnes). After seeing a pair of pictures and hearing the stimulus sentences describing the first picture, participants were asked to describe the second picture, only depicting either the goal or the source protagonist. In the follow up studies, Rosa and Arnold asked participants to read the stimulus sentences in a story-continuation task. One of the protagonists in the sentences was underlined and the participants were asked to continue the sentence with the underlying protagonist. As predicted, the participants used more pronouns to refer to the goal protagonist than the source protagonist, in both the subject and non-subject position, showing the relevance of thematic roles. Also, participants used more pronouns to refer to protagonists in subject position, showing the relevance of syntactic position. However, because the subject protagonist in their study was also the first-mentioned protagonist, it remains unclear whether the effect was attributable to grammatical role or to first mention. This confound was tackled in a study by J\u00e4rvikivi et al. (2017). They conducted eye- tracking experiments in which they presented pictures and spoken sentences in Finnish with two types of sentence structure. One sentence type had a subject-verb-object structure (SVO), and the other sentence type had an object-verb-subject structure (OVS). In the sentences, order-of-mention (first, second) and grammatical role (subject, object) were two independent factors. The results showed a main effect of order-of-mention: that the participants looked more at the first-mentioned protagonist than the second-mentioned protagonist, regardless of the grammatical roles. The results did not show a main effect of grammatical roles or an interaction between order-of-mention and grammatical roles. Based on participants' percentages of looks at the two protagonists, they concluded that order-of-mention influenced the implicit causality bias, first mention causing more looks, but grammatical roles did not. Though syntactic function and order of mention may have an impact on the choice of protagonist and on the choice of type of referential expression, in the context of implicit causality, the influence is considered less important than the effect of semantic or thematic roles. Yet, studies on Chinese suggest a more prominent role of syntactic variables in Chinese (Chen et al. 2000; Simpson et al. 2016; Yang et al. 1999; 2003; Xu 2015).137 Implicit causality and sentence structure in Mandarin Chinese The present study focuses on how a typical variation in syntactic structure of interpersonal verbs in Mandarin Chinese affects the implicit causality bias of the verb. In particular, we will compare the IC bias pattern of verbs in two syntactic structures: the well-known subject-verb-object (SVO) structure and a typical construction in Mandarin Chinese, in which the object is moved as prepositional phrase in front of the verb: subject- preposition/co-verb-object-verb (SCOV). 5.1.2 Co-verbs in Mandarin Chinese The core of the difference between the SVO and SCOV structure is the syntactic function and order of the non-subject protagonist. In the SVO structure, the object follows the verb, as in Dutch or English. In the SCOV verb, it is accompanied by a so-called co-verb (Li & Thompson 1974). Co-verbs are semantically like prepositions, but their form is in most cases homophonous to the form of verbs. The most common co-verb is the ba, a construction which is studied extensively (e.g., Li 2019; Li & Thompson 1974; Huang et al. 2009; Sybesma 1999). The co-verb ba originates from the verb meaning hold , take , or handle in ancient Chinese and it has been grammaticalized into a preposition (e.g., Ziegeler 2000; Bennett 1981; Huang et al. 2009). Most studies consider it a preposition, though some argue in favor of it being a verb (e.g., Fong 2015) or light verb (e.g., Zhao 2021). The meaning of the ba-construction can be understood as \"what IC1 does to IC2 is...\" (Zhao 2021, p.63), which is why the construction is often termed disposal construction (Li & Thompson 1981; Tiee 1986), expressing the idea that the ba-construction \"focuses attention on how the object is disposed of, dealt with, manipulated or handled by the subject\" (Tiee 1986, p. 285), or expresses some kind of affectedness. The ba-construction in example 2 can be interpreted as focusing on what the subject did with the object. Semantically, the two structures can be seen as equivalent, with the ba-construction being restricted to particular cases in which the IC2 is clearly affected in a time-constrained event, explaining for example why ba goes well in so-called resultative events as in example 2 (i.e., the result of the event being that Peter is dead; see Zhao 2021 for a review of the syntactic and semantic options of the ba-construction). Some researchers mention the preference of the ba-construction to be used with a perfective tense (Liu 1997) explaining why the construction is often followed by a perfective aspect marker le (Tsung & Gong 2021). In example 4, this marker stresses the resultative interpretation of the event. In our study, we will use interpersonal verbs fitting in this semantic frame and thus clearly allowing the ba-construction. Syntactically, the comparison of an SVO structure with an SCOV structure shows two differences. First, a co-verb moves the object in front of the verb, which can be seen as a promotion of the NP in terms of sentence position. This idea is in agreement with most semantic and syntactic interpretation proposals of the ba-construction which consider a ba- NP as an upgrade of the direct object. The idea is supported by reading-time study results carried out by Yang et al. (2001; 2003) showing easier processing for the ba-NP compared the canonical direct object NP in topic-shift contexts. Also, it is in agreement with the interpretation of co-verbs (in particular the ba-construction) as promoting the following NP 5138 Chapter 5in terms of topichood (Tsao 1987; Zhan et al. 2020). Likewise, the idea is consistent with some deep structure analyses of the two constructions with the direct object being considered part of the lower VP , while the ba-construction is ordered considered higher in the tree than the VP (Huang et al. 2009; Cheng & Almor 2017a). Yet, there is a second difference between the SVO and SCOV structure which may point in the other direction: changing a direct object in a prepositional phrase can be seen as a demotion of the argument position, from the second most important syntactic function to an oblique function, an NP preceded by a preposition. This hierarchy is for example argued for in the Accessibility Hierarchy of syntactic functions (Keenan & Comrie 1977). In this hierarchy prepositional phrases are considered lower than subjects, direct objects, and indirect objects. In sum, based on the variety of semantic and syntactic interpretations, we can build different expectations about how we expect the structural variation SVO vs SCOV to affect referential choices in Chinese IC verbs. When we consider a co-verb to be a semantic or syntactic promotion of the protagonist or grammatical position, we may expect a ba-NP in an IC sentence to be chosen more often than a direct object NP . Alternatively, when we consider the direct object to occupy a hierarchically higher syntactic position than the co-verb NP , we may expect the opposite. In the next section, we will see that existing IC studies focusing on this structural issue does not offer converging evidence in favor of one of these options. 5.1.3 SVO vs. SCOV in IC studies on Mandarin Chinese Two recent studies include the syntactic variation between a direct object and the co-verb ba in Mandarin Chinese in an attempt to compare the influence of semantic and syntactic variables on the causality bias of IC verbs (Cheng & Almor 2017a; Zhan et al. 2020). Cheng and Almor (2017a) carried out two experiments using 18 (experiment 1) and 36 (experiment 2) stimulus experiencer IC1 verbs in three structural variations (active, active ba-construction and passive) followed by the causal connective 'yinwei' (because) (experiment 1 and 2) or the consequential connective 'yinci' (because of that) (experiment 2). Participants were asked to complete and were free to choose the form of the referential expression. With this set up, Cheng and Almor wanted to find out to what extent implicit causality preferences are affected by syntactic or semantic variables. Applied to the difference between active (SVO) and active ba (SCOV) in SE verbs, the stimulus referent is in the subject position while the experiencer referent is in different object positions. If the structures elicit IC bias differences, it can only be due to the different syntactic positions of the experiencer. The results show that in the two experiments the SCOV structure resulted in more subject referent choices than the SVO structure, or vice versa: participants more often opted for an object referent in the SVO structure than in the SCOV structure. Although this should be seen as support for the idea of the direct object being more prominent than the ba-NP , Cheng and Almor (2017a) explain their results the other way around. They consider the ba-NP as occupying a higher syntactic position compared to the direct object NP , following the syntactic analysis of the deep structure of SVO vs SCOV by Huang et al. (2009), as well as the reading experiment results in Yang et al. (2001; 2003). Starting from this prominence 139 Implicit causality and sentence structure in Mandarin Chinese difference, they argue that the unexpected result of SCOV attracting more rather than less object choices, compared to SVO is the result of a greater syntax-semantics mismatch in the SVO structure, as compared to the SCOV. Given the higher syntactic prominence of the ba-NP , they argue that \"although in both active canonical and ba structures the thematically more prominent experiencer referent (object NP) is in a syntactically less prominent position than the stimulus referent (subject NP), resulting in a syntax-semantics mismatch, the canonical structure would involve a higher level of mismatch than the ba structure, which would explain our finding of more references to the experiencer referent in the active canonical than the ba structures\" (Cheng & Almor 2017a, p. 170). If we understand this explanation correctly, and provided the explanation is beyond dispute, it would mean that the expected effect of the more prominent ba-construction attracting more object references than the direct object should show up when using IC verbs with thematic roles other than just stimulus and experiencer, as well as IC verbs with different biases (IC2 as well as IC1 verbs). In order to clarify this issue, in our study we will use different semantic types of IC1 and IC2 verbs. The most recent study addressing the same issue is Zhan et al. (2020). They start from a similar idea of the ba-construction as being syntactically more prominent than the regular direct object. They claim that ba 'does not change the grammatical function of the argument it marks' (Zhan et al. 2020, p.8). Rather, it may upgrade the ba-NP in terms of topichood, as is argued for in some linguistic analyses (e.g., Tsao 1987, but see also Paul 2002), which in turn may result in ba-NPs being pronominalized and referred more than (regular) direct object NPs. Using typical constructions in Chinese (in particular the bei passive and the ba-construction), Zhan et al. (2020) tested the Bayesian pronoun interpretation theory developed by Kehler et al. (2008). In Kehler et al. (2008)'s approach the interpretation of a pronoun is considered to be affected by three biases clearly distinguishing the choice of referent and the choice of the type of referential expression (pronoun vs. nouns): the pronoun interpretation bias, which is the probability that the comprehender will assign the pronoun to a particular intended referent (in Bayesian terms the posterior), the production bias, which expresses the probability of the speaker to use a pronoun to refer to the intended referent, and the next mention bias, being the probability that a specific referent gets mentioned next by the speaker, regardless of the form of referring expression chosen (in Bayesian terms the prior). These three notions enable them to include the variables known to affect referential choice. An important point of their theory, relevant to our study is that they see a clear association between these biases on the one hand and the (semantic vs syntactic) type of contextual variables affecting referential choice on the other. They suggest that the choice of referent is defined in the first place by semantic and pragmatic factors, like verb type or coherence relations, while the choice of referential expression (pronoun as opposed to nominal expressions) is mostly related to syntactic factors, like grammatical role or sentence position. Zhan et al. (2020) carried out three experiments using sentences with typical manipulations of syntactic construction and verb type in Chinese (i.e., experiment 1: IC1 vs. IC2 verbs; experiment 2: active vs passive; experiment 3 canonical active vs. ba-construction). Additionally, they checked to what extent these factors affect the type of coherence relations 5140 Chapter 5between main IC verb and completion. They asked native Mandarin speakers to complete IC1 and IC2 verb sentences in two prompt conditions: a free prompt condition (IC verb followed by a period) or a pronoun prompt condition. The distribution of first mention referents in the free prompt condition allows them to estimate the next-mention bias (\"which referent is most likely referred to\"), while the distribution of the referential forms (pronoun vs. noun) allows them to estimate the pronoun production bias. According to their theory, these two distributions, calculated in a Bayesian equation, result in an estimation of the pronoun interpretation bias, which can be measured by the distribution of referents in the pronoun prompt condition. In experiment 3, most relevant to our study, they presented each IC sentence in either a canonical active version (SVO) or a ba-construction (SCOV), the way we also do it in this study. As Zhan et al. (2020) consider the ba-construction to be a syntactic structure enabling the ba-NP to increase its topichood and become some sort of secondary topic (Tsao 1987), they expect the ba-construction to result in a higher degree of pronominalization (related to the production and next mention bias). In turn, the Bayesian models predict that any change in the pronoun production or next mention biases that result from the syntactic manipulation will likewise affect interpretation biases in the manner specified by their Bayesian equation (Zhan et al. 2020, p. 29). Thus, they would also expect participants in the ba-construction to choose the IC2 protagonist more often than in the canonical active construction. However, the results were different: the two constructions elicited an equal number of pronominal continuations in the free prompt condition, but - opposite to expectation - the ba-construction elicited more subject continuations than the canonical active construction, in particular in IC1 verbs, consistent with the results in Cheng and Almor (2017a). Yet, Zhan et al. (2020) found out that this difference was fully due to the fact that ba-constructions apparently elicited more explanation relations than the canonical active construction. When controlled for the type of discourse relation, there was no longer a difference between the two structures in terms of more subject mentions or a higher degree of pronominalization. Therefore, in our study, we will include the connective because so as to stimulate participants to produce explanatory coherence relations in their completions. In sum, existing studies start from the idea of the ba-NP being syntactically more prominent than the direct object. Yet their results are not conclusive, rather point in the other direction. Therefore, here we will study the same variation again, thereby using different semantic types of IC1 and IC2 verbs in an explanatory completion context (because) and using the pronoun prompt, the experimental task most directly related to the choice of the referent. 5.2 Method In this experiment, incomplete implicit causality sentences were presented to participants and they were asked to complete the sentences and to assign a referent for an ambiguous pronoun in these sentences. Based on participants' completions and their pronoun reference choices, the bias direction and strength of each verb in both the SVO and SCOV sentences were calculated and compared.141 Implicit causality and sentence structure in Mandarin Chinese 5.2.1 Participants Experiment advertisements were posted on different university bulletin board system websites, for example, http://bbs.nju.edu.cn/ , in China to recruit participants. 220 native Chinese participants who had a bachelor's degree or were going to have a bachelor's degree in the near future participated in the experiment. Among them, 166 participants finished the task and completed the sentences in a sensible way; 54 participants were excluded because they gave up in the middle of the experiment, they did not produce sensible sentences, or make always the same referential choice. The mean age of the 166 participants (57 males) was 24.9 years. Participants received 1 euro for their participation. 5.2.2 Materials The sentences in the completion experiment were selected in four steps. In step 1, IC verbs used in previous IC studies were translated and checked in Chinese corpora. In step 2 we increased this selection by searching additional interpersonal verbs in these corpora. In step 3, we asked linguists to check the acceptability of the two structure versions (SVO and SCOV) of the selected verbs. In step 4, we asked Chinese non-linguists to do the same. The four steps resulted in 49 IC causality verbs we used in the experiment. Step 1. An initial set of implicit causality verbs was collected through translation of verbs used in previous implicit causality studies in other languages, in particular Dutch (Cozijn et al. 2011; Koornneef & van Berkum 2006; Pickering & Majid 2007), English (Hartshorne & Snedeker 2013), German (Fiedler & Semin 1988), Finnish (Pyykk\u00f6nen & J\u00e4rvikivi 2010), Italian (Franco & Arcuri 1990) and Spanish (Goikoetxea et al. 2008). From these studies, 415 verbs were taken out and translated in 540 Chinese verbs (as some verbs had more than one translation in Mandarin Chinese). These 540 verbs were checked in the two Chinese corpora: the Beijing Language and Culture University corpus (http://bcc.blcu.edu.cn/ ) and the Center for Chinese linguistics Peking University Corpus (http://ccl.pku.edu.cn:8080/ ccl_corpus/index.jsp) so as to examine whether they can be used in both the SVO and SCOV structures. This resulted in the selection of 27 verbs used with three co-verbs: ba (example 3), xiang (example 5), and dui (example 6). As it is not possible to check frequencies of these constructions of the verbs in the corpora, we checked the naturalness of the two constructions in two tests (see below). (5) Subject Co-verb Object Verb Zhangsan xiang Lisi zhu he John towards congratulate Peter' towards Peter respect 'John respected Peter' Semantically, both xiang and dui can be roughly translated as towards in English, and they were homophonous verbs in ancient Chinese (Sun 1996). As towards in English shows direction, these two co-verbs show the direction of the action/attitude of the verb, that is, from the subject towards the object. Step 2. In order to expand the list of verbs, we searched additional verbs (outside the list of 415 verbs used in previous IC studies) in the same corpora. This search resulted in 35 additional verbs. Step 3 (pretest 1). For each selected verb, we constructed two versions with two common Chinese male proper names (Zhangsan and Lisi), one in the SVO structure (see example 7) one in the SCOV structure (see example 8). (7) Zhangsan verb Lisi (le) yinwei ta John verb Peter aspect (ba only) because he (8) Zhangsan co-verb Lisi verb (le) yinwei ta John co-verb Peter aspect marker (ba only) because he In the second clause of the sentences, we used an overt male pronoun (ta) . Chinese also allows for a null pronoun, but studies suggest a similar level of acceptability of these two options (e.g., Zhan et al. 2020, p 10; Yang et al. 1999). The resulting 124 (62*2) sentences were used in an online Qualtrics judgment task (https://www.qualtrics.com/). Twelve native Mandarin linguists were asked to read and complete all 124 sentences in a random order. For each sentence, the linguists were asked to judge and choose whether it was natural or not. If they judged the sentence as being natural, they were asked to complete the sentence so that the expected verb bias could be calculated; if they judged the sentence as unnatural, they were asked either to change the sentence, or to indicate no adequate sentence could be constructed. The results of the judgment task showed that among these 124 sentences, 65 sentences were rated as natural by over 75% of the linguists. Among these 65 sentences, there were 26 sentence pairs. The other 36 sentence pairs were revised on the basis of the participants' comments by adding a perfect marker, changing dui into xiang , or in some cases to choose 143 Implicit causality and sentence structure in Mandarin Chinese a synonym. Revisions based on the linguists' comments were made. This resulted in 52 sentence pairs (104 sentences in total) for further testing. On the basis of the completions of the linguists, we expected 31 verbs to be IC1 verbs, and 21 IC2 verbs. Step 4 (pretest 2). In pre-test 2, 57 native Mandarin Chinese speakers (13 male) were asked to judge the naturalness of half of the remaining sentences on a 1-7 Likert scale. The 104 sentences (52*2) were divided over two lists so that each list had one version of each verb (SVO or SCOV), and the two lists had a fair division of SVO vs. SCOV and IC1 vs. IC2 verbs. Each list was complemented with 52 fillers. The filler sentences had the same sentence structures but with non-implicit causality verbs or other co-verbs. The first two and the final two sentences were fillers and no more than three consecutive sentences were experiment sentences. The participants were bachelor students in Nanjing University of the Arts as non-paid volunteers. Their mean age was 21.8 years. The test was conducted in a classroom as a pencil and paper test. The participants of each group were handed one of the lists a list of materials. In the instruction page, participants were asked to read the verb sentences one by one, and to judge how natural they were by giving a rating score on a 1-7 (unnatural- natural) Likert scale. If the participants thought the sentence was natural and acceptable, it should be rated with a 7; if they thought the sentence was unnatural or unacceptable, it should be rated with a 1; if the participants were not sure, they could rate it between 2 and 6. The higher score they gave, the more natural the sentence was. The participants were also instructed they should not think too long, and their ratings should not be influenced by the incompleteness of the sentences. Once the participants understood the instruction, they started the test. Mean rating values of each verb in the two sentence structures were calculated. Verbs with a mean score higher than 4 in both the SVO and SCOV conditions were considered as natural sentence pairs. This resulted in 49 verbs for the sentence completion experiment: 31 IC1, 19 IC2; 32 verbs have the co-verb ba, 9 dui, and 8 xiang . The two construction versions of the remaining 49 verbs (SVO and SCOV), were distributed over four lists (two with 24 verbs, two with 25 verbs) the way it was done in the pretests. In each list, there were no more than three consecutive same structure or IC bias items. Participants were assigned randomly to one of the four lists by Qualtrics. 5.2.3 Design This experiment was a within-participant design with Verb Bias (IC1 and IC2) and Structure (SVO and SCOV) as independent variables and mean scores of participants' referential choice as the dependent variable. 5.2.4 Procedure The experiment was conducted online through Qualtrics and consisted of two tasks: a completion task and a referential choice task. Participants received instruction on the first task, together with two examples. After 5144 Chapter 5that, they clicked a button so that the incomplete sentences appeared on the screen, which they had to complete one by one. After the completion task, they were told they would see each completed sentence again, each time followed by two buttons representing the subject and object referent of the main clause (Zhangsan and Lisi). They were asked to reread each sentence and press the button of the referent the pronoun ta (he) was intended to refer to. They received two examples so that they could understand that both the subject and the object were possible choices. After that they clicked a button so that the completed sentences appeared on the screen. The experiment lasted around 30 minutes in total. 5.2.5 Data analysis The 166 participants were presented with 24 or 25 sentences resulting in 4068 sentences. As we used the 'because' construction so as to assure that completions would be explanatory in nature, we first carried out a partial check of the discourse relation between main clause and completion. We randomly selected around 10% of the cases, balanced over the two constructions and all verbs, together 396 completions. Following Kehler, et al. (2008, p. 4), we considered a completion explanatory when it offered a cause or reason for the event of the main clause. In example 9, Lisi's promotion is the cause for Zhangsan to congratulate Lisi. Example 10 implies intentionality on the part of Zhansan, his mood is the reason why he provoked Lisi. Note that we represent the participant's choice in capitals between squared brackets. (9) Zhangsan zhu he Lisi, yinwei ta [LISI] sheng zhi le. (CS1116) Zhangsan tiao xin Lisi, yinwei ta [ZHANGSAN] xin qing bu hao, xiang da jiao. (CS2558) Zhangsan provoked Lisi, because he [ZHANGSAN] was in a bad mood and wanted to fight. (11) Zhangsan xia pao le Lisi, yinwei ta [ZHANGSAN] xia ren. (CS2494) Zhangsan scared away Lisi, because he [ZHANGSAN] is scary. Results showed that among the selected completions, 99,2% were explanations to the first clause of the IC verbs. Only a few cases could not be considered as such, like example 11, which is not a cause, but just a re-description of the meaning of the main clause (Pickering & Majid 2007, p.782). The partial check shows that the causal connective because managed to trigger the participants to produce explanations in completions. Data coding. In the analysis of the data (n=4068), we use the participants' choice as the basis of the analyses. Yet, we excluded cases with an unambiguous mismatch between the outcome of the referential choice task and the completion task. To that end, we manually checked whether the completion was congruent with the choice made in the referential 145 Implicit causality and sentence structure in Mandarin Chinese choice task afterwards. The author and a native Chinese linguist coded independently all cases. On the basis of the manual analysis, we excluded 33 cases with a mismatch between the referential choice and the completions. In these cases, the referential choice did not match the repeated proper noun (n=1), see example 12, the completion had a plural pronoun subject (n=17), as in example 13, or a dual proper noun subject (n=15) as in example 14. (12) Zhangsan qiao zhao le lisi, yinwei ta [ZHANGSAN] Zhangsan Lisi, because they [ZHANGSAN] are good friends. (14) Zhangsan ba Lisi chou hua le, yinwei ta gen Lisi [ZHANGSAN] you chou. (CS3803) Zhangsan defamed Lis, because he and Lisi [ZHANGSAN] have hated each other. Furthermore, there was disagreement between the two coders in 3% of the cases (n=124; Cohen's Kappa 0.94). Since it is not possible for coders to be sure about the participants' interpretation, we gave them the benefit of the doubt and considered these cases valid cases on the basis of the participants' choice. We also decided to consider two more special cases as valid completions: completions with two pronouns (n=450) as in example 15, and embedded completions (n=67) as in example 16. (15) Zhangsan ba Lisi chou hua le, yinwei ta [ZHANGSAN] ji du ta. (CS3803) Zhangsan defamed Lisi, because he [ZHANGSAN] is jealous zhong Lisi, because [ZHANGSAN] thinks that Lisi is great. In example 15, there are two single male pronouns, ta, in the completion, one in the subject position of the completion, and the other in the object position of the completion. When the participants were asked to choose a referent for the pronoun in the second clause, they could choose a referent for either of the pronouns. First, the participants made a wrong choice for the object pronoun. In this case, the choice is not the same as the intended subject of the completion. Second, they made a correct choice for the subject pronoun. In this case, the choice is the same as the intended subject. In example 15, the participant made a correct choice for the subject pronoun and made it a valid completion. The completion in example 16 is clearly explanatory (Lisi is great), but the embedding and the participant's referential choice ([ZHANGSAN] thinks) makes it an incongruent, yet valid completion. 5146 Chapter 5In sum, we excluded 33 cases, resulting in 4035 valid cases. We tested the correlation between the coders' choices and the participants' choices for the 4035 cases. The correlation is high, r = 0.97, p <.001. This further substantiates our decision to take the participants' choices as basis of the analyses. Statistical analysis. The statistical analysis was conducted in two steps. In the first step, the bias direction of each verb was determined. We calculated the mean object percentages of sentences for each verb in the SVO structure and in the SCOV structure, separately. Given the goal of our study, we were interested only in the change of bias strength in the two syntactic constructions, not in the question whether verbs could be considered to be either IC1 verbs or IC2 verbs. Therefore, we simply considered all verbs with a less than 50% object referent choice as IC1 verbs, and with more than 50% object choice as IC2 verbs. As a result, we distinguish 33 IC1 verbs and 16 IC2 verbs, see the Appendix in Section 5.5 for the results of all verbs. Based on the verb bias direction obtained in the first step, in the second step, we calculated the mean object percentage of each participant in the two sentence structures and the two bias directions. That means that for each participant, four mean object percentages were calculated, namely the mean percentages of (1) the IC1 verbs in the SVO structure; (2) IC2 verbs in the SCOV structure. Analyses of variances on these four mean scores were conducted with Bias (IC1 and IC2) and Structure (SVO and SCOV) as independent variables. Such within- subject analyses were conducted first on all valid sentences and then on sentence pairs with the three different co-verbs separately. 5.3 Results 5.3.1 Descriptives Means of participants across conditions Table 5.1 shows that the mean object NP choice percentage is lower than 50% overall (42,3%), which reflect the simple fact that the data have more completions of IC1 verbs (having a low percentage of NP2/object choices, n=2717) than IC2 verbs (n=1318). Furthermore, it shows a mean percentage of object (NP2) choices for IC1 and IC2 verbs of 26,4% and 75,4% respectively, showing an almost identical division of congruent and incongruent cases for IC1 and IC2 verbs, roughly three vs. one quarter. Two verbs turned out to have a bias different from what we expected on the basis of the pretests: in the pretest, the verbs zi xun (consult, with co-verb xiang ) and teng ai (favor, with co-verb dui) were weakly biased (58%) IC2 verbs, while they turned into weakly biased IC1 verbs in the experiment (57% and 54% respectively). Therefore, we consider them in the analysis and in Table 5.1 IC1 verbs, based on the participants' choice. Changing the status of these verbs (from IC1 to IC2) makes hardly a difference \u2014 > 27%; IC2: 75,4 \u2014 > 73,7%).147 Implicit causality and sentence structure in Mandarin Chinese Table 5.1 Mean object NP choice percentage of the two IC biases (IC1, IC2), the two sentence structures (SVO, SCOV), and the three co-verbs (ba, dui, xiang) IC bias All Ba Dui co-verbs, Table 5.1 shows that dui triggered a higher percentage of the object NP choice (69,7%), compared to ba (37,5%) and xiang (39,6%). This is because in our study, seven out of nine IC verbs of dui are IC2 verbs. In contrast, most verbs of ba and xiang are IC1 verbs. For more details about each verb, please see the Appendix. 5.3.2 Testing hypotheses In this section, statistics of the analyses of variances for all completions and completions per co-verb are presented. Based on the bias directions of verbs, we analyzed the participants' object NP choices for all data and for the three co-verbs separately. Table 5.2 shows a significant main effect of verb bias for all verbs as well as for verbs with the three co-verbs separately. This simply expresses the different biases of IC1 and IC2 verbs: in completing IC2 verbs, participants more often followed the NP2 bias, while they chose more often the NP1 referent to complete IC1. Structure, however, did not have any significant effect, and there was no interaction between Structure and Bias, not for all verbs, nor for the three co-verbs separately. Table 5.2 Analyses of variance of mean object NP choice comparison by participants for all sentences and three types of co-verb sentence pairs separately Overall Structure F(1,660) = 1.505 p = .220 2 = .002 Bias F(1,660) = 464.243 p < .001 2 = .413 Structure * Bias F(1,660) = 0.152 p = 0.697 2 < .001 Ba Structure F(1, 660) = 0.432 p = .511 2 = .001 Bias F(1, 660) = 357.379 p < .001 2 = .351 Structure * Bias F(1, 660) = 0.176 p = .675 2 < .001 Dui Structure F(1, 325) = 0.966 p = .326 2 = .003 Bias F(1, 325) = 32.012 p < .001 2 = .090 Structure * Bias F(1, 325) = 3.688 p = .056 2 = .011 Xiang Structure F(1, 328) = 2.510 p = .114 2 = .008 Bias F(1, 328) = 94.892 p < .001 2 = .224 Structure * Bias F(1, 328) = 1.806 p = .180 2 = .005 5148 Chapter 55.3.3 Additional analyses on ba Cheng and Almor (2017a) used only stimulus-experiencer IC1 verbs and found that the ba SCOV construction triggered less object (NP2) referent choices than the SVO structure. Zhan et al. (2020) found in IC1 verb completions the same: less object (NP2) choices in the ba SCOV construction compared to the SVO structure. In IC2 verb continuations they did not find such an effect. In order to investigate whether we see a similar effect in our data, we carried out an additional analysis on all ba sentences and their SVO variants (n=2649; 65,7%). However, Table 5.3 does not show a similar effect. A paired sample t-test by participants among sentence pairs with ba does not show that among IC1 verb sentence pairs with ba, the ba-construction triggered fewer object NP choices than the SVO structure (Mdiff = -0.027, t(165) = -1.353, p = .178). Also, there was no such difference among IC2 verb sentence pairs (Mdiff = -0.006, t(165) = -0.180, p = .858). Table 5.3 For all ba sentence completions and their SVO variant (n=2649), the mean percentage of object NP choice for IC1 and IC2 verbs. SVO SCOV p 578) 75,1 74,7 .858 Thus far, the results do not show any effect of syntactic structure in our data, which confirms the major role of verb semantics in the bias direction and strength of IC verbs. Given the consistent effect of syntactic structure on IC1 verbs found elsewhere (Cheng and Almor 2017a; Zhan et al. 2020), we tried one more additional analysis to find something similar in our data. We took all IC1 ba SCOV sentences and their SVO variants (n=2071), and split them in strongly and weakly biased IC1 verbs. We assumed there may be a chance to find an effect of syntactic structure when the effect of verb semantics was less strong, i.e., in weakly biased IC1 verbs. We consider an IC1 verb strong when more than 75% of participants followed the NP1 bias, a threshold which has been used by Ferstl et al. (2011). In our data 11 verbs were strong, with a bias average of 82,9%; 14 verbs were weak, with a bias average of 64,8%. Table 5.4 Mean object NP choice percentage of the two sentence structures (SVO, SCOV), for weak and strong IC1 ba SCOV their SVO variants (n = 2071). SVO SCOV p (n = 1035) (n = 1036) Weakly biased (n = 1161) 35,2 29,4 .043 Strongly biased (n = 910) 17,1 21,0 .191149 Implicit causality and sentence structure in Mandarin Chinese A paired sample t-test by participants in Table 5.4 shows that as expected, among the weak IC1 verbs, the SCOV ba structure (M = 29,4), triggered fewer object NP choices than the SVO structure (M = 35,2), Mdiff = -0.057, t(165) = -2.040, p = .043. In contrast, among the strong IC1 verbs, the SCOV ba structure (M = 21.0) did not differ from the SVO structure (M = 17,1) in terms of the object NP choices, Mdiff = 0.040, t(83) = 1.319, p = .191. As for IC2 verbs, it is very unlikely for the sentence structure to affect object choice percentages. Among the weak IC2 verbs, a paired sample t-test by participants shows that there was no significant difference in terms of object NP choices between the SCOV ba structure (M = 62,2) and the SVO structure (M = 69,5), p = .333. Among the strong IC2 verbs, there were too few cases to do a statistical test. Yet, among these verbs, the SCOV ba structure (M = 78,9) and the SVO structure (M = 83.1) triggered similar mean percentages of object choices. Considering the similar mean percentages among the strong IC2 verb sentences, it is very unlikely to find an effect of the sentence structure among these verbs. 5.4 Discussion In this study, we investigated whether and how sentence structure influences the implicit causality (IC) bias. We conducted a sentence completion experiment of IC verbs with two sentence structures in Mandarin Chinese differing in the type of object: a canonical object in an SVO structure, and a co-verb object in an SCOV structure. The results of the experiment did not show an effect of object type on the pronoun resolution process, and thus did not confirm the finding that the co-verb object results in more subject continuation preferences, as found in Cheng and Almor (2017a) and Zhan et al. (2020). Only when we looked at ba-constructions of weak IC1 verbs, we found a similar effect. Only in these cases, our results suggest that the co-verb ba somehow downgrades the object protagonist, compared to the canonical object. In explaining the influence of the SCOV structure on the IC bias, there has been two views in the literature. In one of the views, the object in the SCOV is predicted to be downgraded than that in the SVO structure. In terms of pronoun resolution in IC verbs sentences, the object in the SCOV structure is expected to be less likely chosen as the pronoun referent, compared to that in the SVO structure. Not only our results and data from Cheng and Almor (2017a), and Zhan et al. (2020) showed support of the downgrading view among the IC1 verb sentences of the ba-construction. If any, our results slightly support the idea of the 'oblique' co-verb object being lower in the Accessibility Hierarchy of syntactic functions (Keenan and Comrie 1977) than the canonical object. We did not find support for the theoretical positions of the ba-object occupying a higher syntactic status, as argued for e.g., in Cheng and Almor (2017a) and Zhan et al. (2020), or resulting in a higher topic status of the object (Tsao 1987) or a stronger focus on \"how the object is handled by the subject\" (Tiee 1986). Cheng and Almor (2017a) only used stimulus-experiencer IC1 ba sentences. We also used IC2 verbs, but found an effect in (weak) IC1 verbs only. This suggests the IC bias direction influences the effect of the SCOV ba structure. It suggests that the syntactic effect of the ba structure somehow enhances the semantic effect of the IC1 bias. 5150 Chapter 5Zhan et al. (2020) not only used explanation completions, and suggested that the NP1 preference of ba-constructions may be explained by the type of coherence relation. We triggered explanatory relations only (using the connective yinwei/because), and found indeed that the IC1 effect showed up, admittedly only in weak IC1 verbs. Unlike the other studies, we also used three co-verbs (ba, dui, xiang) and found similar patterns in the results. For the seven IC2 verbs in dui sentence pairs, the SCOV dui structure (60.7%) triggered fewer object choices than the SVO structure (75.4%). For the two IC2 verbs of xiang sentence pairs, the SCOV xiang structure (63.1%) structure also triggered fewer object choices than the SVO structure (76.2%). This again suggests support for the idea of co-verbs downgrading the position of the object. This leaves us with the main question: why do we find an NP1 preference in weak IC verbs only, while Cheng and Almor (2017a) and Zhan et al. (2020) found the same effect in strongly biased IC1 verbs? We do not have a conclusive answer. One suggestion would be that our IC1 verbs have a lower degree of affectedness of the object, compared to the verbs in the other studies. Affectedness is a semantic characteristic mainly discussed in relation to the difference between active and passive voice: patients of verbs can be affected in different degrees by the event expressed in the verb. For example, an object or patient is more affected by a verb like 'kill' compared to a verb like 'see' (John kills/sees Peter). High degrees of affectedness make it more likely to focus on the affected patient. This in turn makes it more likely for verbs with highly affected patients are used more often in a passive construction, knowing that \"one of the major functions of the passive is that it demotes the agent of the verb (often the person doing the action of the verb), while giving topic status to the affected patient (the entity being acted on)\" (Biber et al. 1999, p. 477). This in turn means that the frequency in which a verb is used in the passive voice, can be seen as an indication of the degree of affectedness of objects. Following this line of reasoning, we checked the percentage of passive voices of the IC1 verbs from Zhan et al. (2020) and those from our study in the Center for Chinese Linguistics Peking University Corpus (http://ccl.pku.edu.cn/ ). Results showed that the passive voice of all the IC1 verbs in Zhan et al. accounted for 11,50% of all sentences of those verbs in the corpus, similar to the average of passives of our weak IC1 verbs (15,89%), while the strong IC1 verb passives in our data accounted for only 7,01%. But even if affectedness is (part of) the explanation, it remains counterintuitive that a preposition (ba), originally derived from a verb and often explained as a means to highlight an object protagonist decreases rather than increases the tendency to attribute causes to the affected object. We should also note, as an additional reason for differences in results, that we used different types of IC verbs than Cheng and Almor (2017a) and Zhan et al. (2020). All IC1 verbs used by Cheng and Almor (2017a) and around 80% of the IC1 verbs used by Zhan et al. (2020) are mental verbs: stimulus-experiencer verbs, such as move . In contrast, most IC1 verbs used in our study were action verbs (around 75%): agent-patient verbs, such as blackmail . Compared to mental IC verbs which show a strong IC bias consistently across studies, action verbs tended to be influenced more by various pragmatic factors, such as social status of protagonists (e.g., Ferstl et al. 2011; Mannetti & De Grada 1991; Rudolph 151 Implicit causality and sentence structure in Mandarin Chinese & F\u00f6rsterling 1997; Semin & Marsman 1994). For example, some of the strong IC verbs in the SCOV ba structure in our study indicates a social status hierarchy between the two protagonists. Kai chu (fire) indicates that one protagonist is the boss and the other one is employee. Such a factor might bias people's attention to the boss protagonist and makes the sentence structure effect less pronounced. In contrast, among the weak action verbs, there might be less effect from such a pragmatic factor and the sentence structure effect is more pronounced, compared to the strong ones. In any way, our results do not support the idea of syntax having a clear and independent influence on IC verb biases. At most, there is a connection between syntactic structures and semantic characteristics. As such, the results are in line with other studies in which syntactic variables are manipulated, but where also semantic characteristics of these syntactic manipulations are used to explain the results. For example, Rosa and Arnold (2017) found a modifying effect of syntactic position on the IC bias. They found that participants were more likely to choose the goal protagonist as the referent of the ambiguous pronoun than the source protagonist, and found this effect to be stronger when the goal protagonist was in subject position. We did not find such a strong effect than in the non-subject position, showing that the modifying effect of syntactic position on the IC bias. Different from Rosa and Arnold (2017) who found a strong modifying effect of syntactic position on the IC bias, we only found a weak effect. This may partly be due to the fact that the syntactic as well as semantic changes were more subtle than in their materials where the variants represented protagonists with different semantic roles (source-goal) and different syntactic positions (subject-object). Different from J\u00e4rvikivi et al. (2017), who found no effect of order of mention in two symmetrical syntactic structures in Finnish (SVO and OVS), the two protagonists in our experiment did not change order, and we found a weak effect on some verbs. In sum, if syntax has some effect, our results strongly suggest it is linked closely to semantic characteristics of specific syntactic structures. Co-verbs originate from verbs. In particular, the ba-construction stresses the fact that the object is affected by the subject. The results suggest that using this co-verb may make participants pay more attention to the subject. The semantic interpretation of syntactic differences is supported by the finer- grained categorization of IC verb semantics according to the syntactic structures of the IC verbs, developed by Hartshorne and Snedeker (2013). This approach suggests that the semantics of IC verbs also have syntactic roots, as semantic types of verbs show to be able to act in different types of syntactic structures. The variation between canonical and co-verb objects can be seen as one such variation. To conclude, we did not find a strong effect of sentence structures on the IC bias. Yet, we found some weak influence of sentence structures on the IC bias. Among weak IC1 verb sentences, the participants tended to choose the subject protagonist in the SCOV ba structure more often than that in the SVO structure. 5152 Chapter 55.5 Appendix Table 5.5 Mean percentage of object NP choice of the IC2 verbs (n = 16) in the whistle 85,4 Ba 57,1 45,2 Average 76,7 71,1153 Implicit causality and sentence structure in Mandarin Chinese Table 5.6 Mean percentage of object NP choice of the IC1 verbs (n = 33) in the Ba 5Table 5.7 Analyses of variance of mean object NP choice comparison by participants for all sentences and dui and xiang sentence pairs separately without zi xun (consult) and teng ai (favor) Overall Structure F(1,660) = 1.527 p = .217 2 = .002 Bias F(1,660) = 493.650 p < 0.001 2 = .428 Structure * Bias F(1,660) = 0.116 p = 0.733 2 < .001 Dui Structure F(1, 313) = 1.421 p = .234 2 = .005 Bias F(1, 313) = 52.735 p < .001 2 = .144 Structure * Bias F(1, 313) = 2.163 p = .142 2 = .007 Xiang Structure F(1, 327) = 2.924 p = .088 2 = .009 Bias F(1, 327) = 193.236 p < .001 2 = .371 Structure * Bias F(1, 327) = 5.157 p = .143 2 = .007 As mentioned in Section 5.3.1, the two weakly biased IC verbs zi xun (consult) and teng ai (favor) that were expected to be IC2 verbs in the pre-test with 12 Chinese linguists turned out to be IC1 in the experiment. We did not exclude them in the main analyses because these two verbs were weakly biased in both the pre-test and the experiment and do not significantly influence analyses results. Table 5.7 showed that once these two verbs were excluded, the same patterns showed up in the overall analysis and separate analyses with sentence pairs of dui in which teng ai (favor) is used with and sentence pairs of xiang in which zi xun (consult) is used. There is a consistent main effect of Bias in the overall and separate analyses. Yet, there was no main effect of Structure or an interaction between Bias and Structure. 155 Implicit causality and sentence structure in Mandarin Chinese 566CHAPTER 6 Discussion and conclusion158 Chapter 6In social life, people make causal inferences when they interact with others. The causal inferences are believed to be influenced by socio-psychological factors. In this thesis, we focused on how socio-psychological factors, such as culture, group membership, and self perspective, influence people's causal inferences in language use. We focus on implicit causality verbs. The verbs are a group of interpersonal verbs that describe events between two protagonists and bias people's attention to one of the two protagonists as the causer of the events described by the verbs. The previous chapters of the thesis have presented studies that focused on how these socio-psychological factors as well a syntactic factor influence the IC bias. By studying the IC verb sentences, we can better understand how socio- psychological and linguistic factors interact with each other and influence causal inferences in social life. In this final chapter, we will first summarize the main findings and present answers to the main research questions. Next, theoretical and methodological implications of these findings will be discussed. This chapter closes with a conclusion. 6.1 Summary and answers to the research questions The first research question addressed in this thesis was how socio-psychological factors influence the IC bias strength. We study how socio-psychological factors from both an individual and a social level could influence the IC bias strength. The individual variable investigated in Chapters 2 and 3 was self perspective. The self perspective was expected to trigger a tendency to avoid blaming oneself in negative events but to credit oneself in positive events, a self-serving bias (SS bias). The social variables investigated were group membership (Chapter 3) and culture (Chapters 2 and 3). The group membership was expected to trigger a tendency to favor ingroup over outgroup or to disfavor outgroup over ingroup, an intergroup bias (IG bias). Culture has also been investigated as a high-order group membership variable, with comparable expectations. The results showed a mixed picture. No evidence was found regarding the influence of culture on the IC bias strength in either Chapter 2 or Chapter 3. The referential choice task (Chapter 2 and 3) and the rating task (Chapter 2) showed that Dutch participants were equally likely to attribute negative events to others and to attribute positive events to themselves as Chinese participants. Moreover, neither the Chinese nor the Dutch participants chose themselves more often as causer of negative events in ingroup interactions, compared to the outgroup interactions. Although these results did not bear evidence of the influence of participants' cultural background and group membership, they did show that self perspective fairly consistently affected the IC bias strength. The second research question, investigated in Chapter 4, was how the socio- psychological factors influence linguistic characteristics of sentence completions, focusing mainly on the stability of completions. Again, the picture was mixed. Similar to the findings on socio-psychological variables, we found evidence that self perspective influenced completion stability, especially in negative sentences. Yet we did not find clear evidence that culture influenced the IC verb completions. Compared to the Dutch participants, the Chinese participants seemed to be less likely to produce stable and durable completions to 159 Discussion and conclusionthemselves than to the other protagonist in negative IC verb sentences, as predicted by the SS bias. But the effect was weak. For positive IC verb sentences, the results were not in line with the SS bias and neither Chinese participants nor Dutch participants produced more stable and more durable completions to themselves than to the other protagonist. That means they did not try to improve their self-image by crediting themselves with a stable positive completion. In terms of group membership, the Chinese participants tended to produce more stable completions in the outgroup condition than the Dutch participants, although the tendency was weak. We did not find evidence of an overall effect of group membership or an interaction between group membership and culture in terms of stability. The final research question investigated in this thesis, in Chapter 5, was whether sentence structure, a syntactic factor, influences the IC bias strength as well. Two Chinese sentence structures were compared, a canonical subject verb object (SVO) structure and a subject co-verb object verb (SCOV) structure. The question was whether the co-verb structure would result in more prominence of the sentence object, thus influencing the IC bias of the verb. The results did not show clear evidence that sentence structure influenced IC bias strength. We found a weak effect that the SCOV structure, compared to the SVO structure, tended to trigger more NP1 choices, but only in weakly biased IC1 verb sentences. In sum, our results are varied regarding the influence of socio-psychological factors on the IC bias. The findings did not show clear evidence that culture and group membership, two socio-psychological factors, influence the IC bias. Only self perspective, the individual factor, was shown to influence the IC bias consistently, especially in negative IC verb sentences. Moreover, we did not find evidence that sentence structure influences the IC bias. 6.2 Theoretical implications In this section, we restate existing theories of the IC bias in terms of verb semantics, culture, self perspective, group membership, stability, and sentence structure mentioned in Chapter 1. We also discuss whether the present research supports the existing theories, and where it diverges from them. Verb semantics. As explained in Chapter 1, and supported by the results of our studies, verb semantics is the most important factor in determining the IC bias. Previous studies on verb semantics of IC bias verbs have shown that the stimulus role in mental stimulus-experiencer verbs, like irritate , and in mental experiencer-stimulus verbs, like hate, is considered the causer of the event described by the IC bias verb, resulting in an IC1 bias and an IC2 bias, respectively (see e.g., Brown & Fish 1983; Fiedler & Semin 1988; Hartshorne & Snedeker 2013). This was corroborated in both the choice and the rating tasks in Chapters 2 and 3, where we found that the IC bias direction of verbs was congruent with these two classes of mental verbs. This confirms that for mental verbs, the thematic roles determine the IC bias. As for action verbs, our studies were also in line with the literature. We have shown that for agent-patient verbs, like kiss, the agent is the causer of the event described by 6160 Chapter 6the verb and that these verbs have an IC1 bias. In contrast, for agent-evocator verbs, like thank, the evocator is the causer, and these verbs have an IC2 bias. This is in line with the study of Brown and Fish (1983) in which the agent was shown to be the causer of agent- patient verbs. The findings were also in line with research of Au (1986) that showed that for a special subtype of action verbs, agent-evocator verbs, the evocator, that is the one who elicits the action, is the causer. Yet, there has been no agreement in the literature on why the agent is not always the causer. A possible explanation may be found in the syntactic structure in which these IC verbs are embedded (see Hartshorne & Snedeker 2013 for a detailed discussion). According to Hartshorne and Snedeker, agent-evocator verbs, such as thank, are used in NP1 verb NP2 [preposition-attribute] structures, e.g., John thanked Peter [for being honest]. The preposition phrase in the syntactic structure is about the NP2, therefore, the verb has an NP2 IC bias. In contrast, agent-patient verbs, such as kiss, are used in NP1 structures, e.g., Susan The preposition phrase in the syntactic structure is about the NP1, therefore, the verb has an NP1 IC bias. Culture . Our studies did not show that culture has an influence on the IC bias. There are several potential explanations. First, the absence of an effect of culture might be because we tested culture combined with a strong other factor, that is, self perspective. As mentioned in Chapter 3, the self consists of not only an individual self which is about a person's unique characteristics, but also a social self which regards a person's characteristics in relation to others, such as family members or cultural groups. Some studies show that the individual self is valued more than the social self (Nehrlich et al. 2019). This could mean, in our studies, that the SS bias, as a strong motive to protect the individual self, would overrule the cultural effect or the group membership effect, which are weak(er) motives. Second, we cautiously propose that culture might not be an important factor in causal inferences. In the process of making causal inferences, people tend to follow different biases, such as the SS bias and the IG bias, and these biases might not be influenced much by culture. As mentioned in Chapter 2, the SS bias has been shown to be a robust bias, and an absent or attenuated SS bias is often associated with mental health issues (see Greenberg et al. 1992 for a review). It might be possible that people from both Eastern and Western cultures tend to protect a positive self-image. This leads both cultural groups to attribute negative events to others and to attribute positive events to oneself. That is to say, such a bias could also be universal across cultures. This view is also consistent with a universal view of the SS bias in the social behavioral field. For example, Sedikides et al. (2005) showed in a review study that both Eastern and Western people tend to make self-serving judgments, although Eastern people tend to judge themselves highly on collectivistic attributes, such as I am more loyal than other community members , while Western people tend to judge themselves highly on individualistic attributes, such as I am more self-reliant than other community members . If culture does not influence the IC bias, then the question is how to understand social behavioral studies that showed that Eastern people have a weaker SS bias than Western 161 Discussion and conclusionpeople. A possible explanation may be the use of different tasks in these social behavioral studies than ours. In some social behavioral studies, participants were asked to do, for instance, a memory task and were then asked to estimate whether their success or failure in the task was due to their own abilities and efforts, or to luck and task difficulty. Among these four causes, the attribution to their own abilities was considered as the key factor, because it has been shown to be the most internal, stable, and global factor (Sweeney et al. 1986). Sweeney et al. showed that people tend to attribute positive events to their abilities and that they do not tend to do so in negative events. However, the result of this study was obtained with Western participants. Although ability is considered as an internal factor across cultures, it is unclear whether it is also considered as a stable factor across cultures. It may be possible that Eastern people do not consider ability to be a stable factor. For example, Eastern people might think they can spend efforts increasing their ability (see Graham 2020 for a recent review on attributional theory; Hsin & Xie, 2014). Based on this line of thinking, Eastern people could also tend to make self-serving attributions as much as Western people, but Eastern people might not necessarily tend to attribute to ability. Instead, they might tend to attribute (failure and) success to (lack of) efforts, another internal factor, which is less stable. Unlike these social behavioral studies, we did not differentiate types of internal factors. In our study, attribution to internal or external factors was only tested by whether participants chose to attribute causes to themselves or not. This difference in tasks might explain why we did not find cultural differences. Methodologically, we used participants' nationality as a criterion to manipulate culture, asking Chinese and Dutch participants as representatives of Eastern and Western cultures. The Chinese participants were overseas students. It is possible that these overseas students were more Western-oriented than Chinese people living in China. This orientation toward the Western culture might have caused these participants to have the same tendency to make self-serving attributions as the Dutch participants. In order to test whether this was the case, we had added to the experiments a cultural identity task that measures adherence to culture more explicitly. However, sub-analyses of the participants who scored highest on this measure still did not show an effect of culture, suggesting that culture did not play a significant role in causal attribution. Self perspective . We showed that the IC bias could be influenced by the SS bias. Most IC studies have investigated how people make causal inferences in IC verb sentences from a third-personal or neutral perspective. A few exceptions, such as Cunningham et al. (1979), Kasof and Lee (1993), and Wang et al. (2015; 2017; 2020), have shown that when people read the IC verb sentences from a self perspective, that is, when people are involved in the events described by the IC verbs as one of the two protagonists, their causal inferences could be influenced by the SS bias. These studies have shown that people consistently tend to attribute negative events to others. When it comes to positive events, these studies showed inconsistent results whether people would tend to attribute positive events to themselves. Our studies confirm the influence of the SS bias not only in negative events, but to a certain extent also in positive events. 6162 Chapter 6Yet, the results for positive and negative events vary. We found the effect of the SS bias in negative events in both the choice and the rating tasks, while we only found the effect in positive events in the rating task. The results might suggest that the SS bias effect in negative events is stronger than that in positive events. This is in line with previous IC studies that show that it was more likely to find an effect of IC bias in negative IC verb sentences than in positive IC verb sentences. For example, the NP1 bias was found to be stronger in negative verbs than positive verbs (e.g., Franco & Arcuri 1990; Semin & Marsman 1994). Males are more likely to be considered as the causer of negative IC verbs than females, while there was no such difference in positive IC verb sentences (e.g., LaFrance et al. 1997; Mannetti & De Grada 1991). The stronger self perspective effect in negative events is alsor consistent with a widely cited review study from Baumeister et al. (2001) that negativity exerts a stronger effect than positivity across various subfields of social behavior. Baumeister et al. (2001) explained that people have a stronger tendency to avoid damaging than to promote enhancing their self-image. This effect shows up in IC verb sentences as a stronger and more clear attribution of causes to others in negative IC verb sentences. This difference in strength was also the reason that we decided to use only negative IC verb sentences in Chapter 3. Overall, we found a relatively weak effect of the SS bias, compared to many social behavior studies. A review of these studies in Mezulis et al. (2004) showed that the SS bias was found in both positive and negative events. As mentioned, in these studies, participants were asked to attribute their successes or failures to ability, effort, task difficulty, or luck (see e.g., Kashima & Triandis 1986). Participants were not influenced in their choice of one of these four causes. In contrast, in the IC verb sentences, the choice of cause is influenced by the IC bias. That is to say, the SS bias effect was tested in combination with the IC bias in our study, while in social behavior studies the SS bias effect was tested alone. Although the SS bias effect is weaker in our study than in the social behavior studies, our results are similar to those of several other SS bias studies that investigated IC verb sentences, i.e., Cunningham et al. (1979), Kasof and Lee (1993), and Wang et al. (2015; 2017; 2021), as mentioned in Chapter 2. In these studies, the SS bias effect was consistent in negative IC verb sentences, but not in positive IC verb sentences, which was the same as in our results. Group membership. Group membership has not been shown to influence the IC bias strength in our study. This is different from previous studies such as Niemi et al. (2019). Niemi et al. used a strong real-life group manipulation: supporters of republic and democratic parties in the US who are asked to read IC verb sentences involving Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, two presidential candidates of the 2016 presidential election. Results showed that the participants tended to attribute negative IC verb sentences to the opposing candidate and to attribute positive IC verb sentences to their own supporting candidate, regardless of the IC bias. A difference with Niemi et al. (2019)'s study is that we used three-sentence scenarios and asked participants to imagine they were either a member of the same or another group as the other protagonist. Such scenarios have been shown successful in van den Hoven and Ferstl (2018). The scenario-based group manipulation triggered participants to produce longer completions. Yet, these imaginary scenarios are different from the real-life political 163 Discussion and conclusiongroups in Niemi et al. The group bias involving people's real-life attitudes in Niemi et al. is much stronger than the imagined group membership we used in our study. Apparently, this manipulation was not strong enough to display any significant IC bias difference in the linguistic choice and completion task we used. In addition, different from Niemi et al. (2019) who only tested how group membership influenced the IC bias, we also tested how self perspective influenced the IC bias. In this combination, the self perspective exerted a stronger effect, and this may have led to a weaker effect of group membership, similar the possibly weak influence of culture. Niemi et al. asked people to read IC verb sentences from a neutral perspective, and only tested the social self as indicated by real group membership. In contrast, we asked people to read IC verb sentences from a self perspective. We did so because we had expected that we could trigger a larger size of the SS bias when people were involved with an outgroup member than an ingroup members. This means that in our study, not only the social self, but also the individual self indicated by the self perspective was tested. That is to say, there was a competition between the social self and the individual self in our study. The results suggested that between the social and the individual selves, the motive to protect the individual self was much stronger than that to protect the social self, which might have led to the absence of an effect of group membership. In future research, it might therefore be advisable to study the group bias without the influence of the self perspective. In that case, an influence of group membership might show as a tendency to favor ingroup over outgroup in making causal attributions. Stability . Most IC studies focus on the protagonist choice that participants make. We did too, but we also analyzed sentence completions. In our analyses, we found that the self perspective not only influences the choice of referent, but also the stability of sentence completions: when participants attribute negative events to themselves, they tend to produce fewer stable completions (fewer attributes, fewer durable completions), compared when they attribute causes to others. This finding is in line with Hartshorne et al. (2015), who suggested that completion types influence the IC bias. Hartshorne and colleagues (2013; 2014; 2015) used a novel word as either a noun or a verb in IC verb sentence completions (e.g., Sally frightened Mary, because she daxed/she is a dax). Hartshorne et al. (2015) found that the use of a novel verb (as compared to a noun) resulted in a stronger IC2 bias, and suggested an explanation for this effect on the basis of the semantic difference in event stability of the novel verb and noun: the noun (dax) represents a stable property of the participant, while the verb represents a less stable action event. With our findings, future research could provide participants with completions differing in stability (e.g., attributes vs action) and test whether this stability difference influences participants' choices in the IC verb sentences. In this way, it might be able to explain the shift towards the NP2 mentioned by Hartshorne et al. (2015). Our study is the first one that investigated incongruent completions, representing roughly a quarter of completions in IC studies (Ferstl et al. 2011). Incongruent completions are those that refer to the unbiased protagonist. The completion analysis shows the same tendency as mentioned above, i.e., to use fewer stable completions once participants decide to attribute negative causes to themselves in unbiased position. 6164 Chapter 6Furthermore, we showed that there was a correspondence between the stability of the IC verbs and the stability of the completions, and between the polarity of the IC verbs and that of the completions. Our study showed that stability and polarity and stability of IC verbs influence sentence completions. Our results showed that participants tended to produce more stable completions for state IC verbs than for action IC verbs, with state IC verbs being more stable than action IC verbs. Sentence structure . We did not find strong evidence that sentence structure in Mandarin Chinese influences the IC bias. This was not in line with several previous IC studies that used the same two sentence structures in Chinese (SVO vs SCOV, Cheng & Almor 2017a; Zhan et al. 2020). They found that people tended to attribute the cause for the IC verb event more to the NP1 in IC1 verb sentences in the SCOV structure than in the SVO structure. We only found such a tendency among weak IC1 verb sentences in our study, suggesting that the object in the SCOV structure was downgraded in terms of accessibility, as also proposed by Cheng and Almor (2017a) and Zhan et al. (2020). We suggested this tendency may be explained (partly) by different degrees of affectedness of the verbs. The way in which a patient can be affected by the event expressed in the verb is mostly discussed in relation to the difference between active and passive voice. Among our weak IC1 verbs, we observed a similar extent of affectedness as the IC1 verbs used in the other Chinese studies. NP1 vs. NP2 . In most of our studies, the NP1 seems to be more likely to be attributed as the causer of the IC verb sentences than the NP2. We believe this may be due to the NP1's syntactic position. In Chapter 2, we have seen that the NP1 was more likely to be attributed as the causer of the IC verb sentences than the NP2, regardless of other factors. Similarly, we found in Chapter 5 that there was a weak tendency that the NP1 was chosen more often in the SCOV structure than in the SVO structure. Potential explanations of more frequent NP1 attributions are structural factors such as the first-mentioned effect (Gernsbacher 1990), subjecthood (Hobbs 1979), and parallel function (Sheldon 1974). Strong vs. weak IC verbs. In our studies, we used strong IC verbs. It might be argued that the strong IC verbs made it difficult to find effects of group and culture, and the effect of SS bias in positive events because of a ceiling effect. We believe this ceiling effect might be an issue in positive IC verb sentences, but it was not an issue in negative IC verb sentences. In Chapter 2, in the positive IC verb sentences, we expected that people would attribute positive events more often to themselves than to others, in order to credit themselves. This would lead to an increase of IC bias strength when attributing positive IC verb sentences to themselves. On average, the IC bias strength for positive IC verbs in which the participants were not involved were high (70,0% for IC1 verbs and 87,2% for IC2 verbs). We cannot deny that this high IC bias strength might prevent participants from attributing more positive IC verb sentences to themselves. This could also further prevent Dutch participants from making self-serving bias attributions in positive IC verb sentences more often than Chinese participants. We do not have a clear answer for this question, but hope for future studies that that will shed light on this issue. 165 Discussion and conclusionYet, in negative IC verb sentences, the ceiling effect was not an issue. In negative IC verb sentences, we expected group membership, self perspective and culture variables lead to an IC bias strength decrease instead of an increase. For the group membership in Chapter 3, we predicted that in negative IC verb sentences, participants would choose themselves less often when they were involved with an outgroup member than with an ingroup member. This less often choice of themselves would lead to a IC bias strength decrease in the outgroup condition than the ingroup condition, rather than an increase. There was no ceiling effect. Previous IC studies, such as Niemi et al. (2019; 2020) which also used strong IC verbs showed that with strong IC verbs, real-life political group attitude could still make participants to attribute negative events less often to the political candidate of their own party than the opposing party, also leading to a lower IC bias strength. The studies from Niemi et al (2019; 2020) further supported that it is possible to use the strong IC verbs to investigate the effect of group membership on the IC bias strength in negative events. Similarly, in negative IC verb sentences in Chapter 2, the ceiling effect was not an issue either. In Chapter 2, we predicted that people would be less likely to attribute negative events to themselves than to others, leading to a lower IC bias strength. This tendency was supported in our study. We also expected the tendency was larger among the Dutch and the Chinese participants, which means a even lower IC bias strength among the Dutch participants than the Chinese participants. For this cultural effect in the negative IC verb sentences, there was no ceiling effect. Yet, we still did not find such a cultural difference in the negative IC verb sentences. 6.3 Methodological implications The IC bias has often been investigated in either comprehension or production experiments. In our studies, we used production experiments in testing the IC bias. We did so because the production experiments could let us investigate how socio-psychological factors influence causal inferences related to the IC bias regarding not only who is the causer of the event described by the verb but also what types of causes go with that choice. In this section, we will discuss the production methods we used in our experiments, that is, the choice task, the rating task, and the sentence completion task, and compare those to the tasks used in previous IC studies. We will also discuss whether the order of the production tasks has an influence on the results. In addition, we will discuss some practical implications of automatic and manual coding of sentence completions, as used in Chapter 4. Choice vs. rating task. We combined two judgment tasks, a choice task and a rating task, in our experiments. According to Hartshorne (2014), these two tasks tap into different types of knowledge. The choice task focuses on linguistic knowledge about the verbs and the rating task focuses on causal, non-linguistic attitudinal knowledge about the event. Hartshorne used the ten most positive and the ten most negative IC verbs from a 300-verb list of Ferstl et al. (2011) and presented them in sentences in which the two protagonists were of different social hierarchies and genders. He tested how people considered the causer of IC sentences in both a choice task and a causal rating task. Each sentence had a causal completion that 6166 Chapter 6ended with a novel word, such as dax, e.g., The duke blamed the butler, because he is a dax. Participants had to choose between the butler and the duke to determine who he is. Moreover, the participants also needed to judge the causality of the sentences in the causal rating task on two nine-point rating scales, as in example 1. (1) The duke blamed the butler. How likely is it that this was because: (1a) The duke is the kind of person who blames people Not likely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Definitely likely (1b) The butler is the kind of person people blame. Not likely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Definitely likely Hartshorne showed that these two tasks lead to systematically different results. There was an effect of social hierarchy in the causal rating task, but not in the choice task. He uses these results as indication that social hierarchy information is used in evaluating causal attribution in a rating task but not in the linguistic choice of referents, suggesting that these are different cognitive processes. In our study in Chapter 2, we only found weak confirmation of Hartshorne (2014)'s results. We used the same IC verb sentences in both a causal rating task and a choice task. We found the social behavior SS bias effect on IC verb sentences in the rating task in (IC1) negative and positive verbs, while the same effect in the choice task was only found in negative verbs only. This difference may suggest that the SS bias more likely exerted a stronger influence at the behavioral level. A difference between our method and that of Hartshorne (2014) is that we included the causal connective because after the subject + verb + object clause in the sentence, a method not uncommon in IC studies (see e.g., Ferstl et al. 2011). Including the connective because elicits continuations that contain most likely an explanation for the event described by the IC verb in the main sentence, and that was what we were after. After presenting a full stop, many different types of continuations may occur, as shown by, for instance, Kehler et al. (2008). In Chapter 4, we showed that the causal connective successfully triggered explanations in the completions, which offered us the opportunity to conduct an in-depth analysis of explanation completions. A difference with many IC studies, like Kehler et al. (2008), is that we used full names in the second clauses of the IC verb sentences. Asking participants to choose between two full names of protagonists forced clear, unambiguous choices from the participants. This helped us to obtain a clear picture of how socio-psychological factors influence the choice of a protagonist in the IC verb sentences. Yet, a full name is not the only form of anaphoric expression. A most commonly investigated form are pronouns, i.e., he or she. The forced choice task between two full names in our study deprived us of the chance to test which type of anaphoric expression participants would choose in the second clauses, which is the topic of anaphoric (IC) studies (e.g., Fukumura & van Gompel 2010; Vogels et al. 2013). Future studies might compare different anaphoric expressions in IC verb sentences, with a pronoun, without a pronoun, and with full names. Such a setup would allow for the investigation of the influence of socio-psychological factors on the choice of anaphoric expression.167 Discussion and conclusionOrder of tasks. Another methodological issue that deserves attention is that we used different orders of the choice and the completion tasks in Chapters 2, 3, and 5. We started with a choice task followed by a completion task in Chapters 2 and 3. In Chapter 5, we presented the completion task before the choice task. It might be argued that the order difference might influence how participants processed the IC verb sentences in terms of the amount of time used, yet we do not believe it would influence how they made causal inferences in IC verb sentences significantly. For example, in the first method, there was a smaller time gap between the two tasks than in the second method. For each sentence, the participants made a choice and then immediately completed the sentence. In the second method, participants completed all IC verb sentences, thereby implicitly also solving the referential choice. Then they were presented with their completions and were asked to make the referential choice. In the second method, it was possible that participants might need some more time to make a choice, because they needed to read not only the IC verb but also their own completions. Yet, both orders produced reliable results in terms of IC bias direction and strength. In Chapters 2 and 3 with English IC verbs, our participants' choices and ratings were similar to results from previous studies using similar methods (e.g., a rating task in Brown & Fish 1983; a choice task in Hartshorne et al. 2013; 2014; 2015; a completion task in Ferstl et al. 2011). In Chapter 4 with Chinese IC verbs, our participants' results were similar to those from a pre-test with Chinese linguists and those from a Chinese IC study (Zhan et al. 2020). Moreover, in Chapter 2, we used a choice task followed by a rating task. Results showed the IC bias strength in the rating task is weaker than in the choice task. We believe that the order of the two tasks would not influence this weaker score in the rating task than in the choice significantly. With our current order, the participants might realize, after the choice task in which they could make a binary choice, that it was possible to make a more gradient causal rating between the two protagonists instead of a binary choice. In contrast, if we had the rating task first and then the choice task, the same pattern of a weaker IC bias strength in the rating task than the choice task would still show up. The participants would realize after the rating task, in the choice task they need to make a binary choice without the gradience as in the rating task. We believe that the weaker IC bias strength in the rating task than the choice task was due to the binary or the gradient characteristics of the two tasks instead of the order of the two tasks. Manual vs. automatic coding. We used both automatic and human coding in studying completions. Our results showed that the automatic coding of completions is an efficient method. Yet, compared to human coding, there is still room for improvement. In terms of verb type analysis, automatic coding cannot solve several issues. For example, in the LCM categorization, state action verbs (SAV), such as anger, are considered to belong to the same category as interpretative action verbs (IAV), such as help. Yet, several LCM dictionaries, including the recent one from Seih et al. (2017) used in our study, categorizes SAV as state verbs (SV). This leads to noise in the classification when automatically categorizing completions. Also, the method is unable to detect be-attributes which form a large part of the IC completions, since the dictionary focuses on content verbs. Furthermore, the dictionary cannot categorize verbs used in a figurative meaning, break a vase vs. break a promise. 6168 Chapter 6Apart from difficulties with verb type, automatic coding also has difficulty in coding tense and polarity. The systems have difficulty with coding present tense. This is because verbs in the present tense and verbs in the past tense which are preceded by a modal verb have the same form, for instance, I work hard vs I did work hard. In terms of polarity, two out of the three programs that were used (Pattern and LIWC) cannot detect double negations. The third one, Vader, can only detect double negations within tri-grams. Yet, double negations also frequently occur outside tri-grams and should be coded properly. A potential way to improve the stability and polarity coding of the completions is to take the whole sentence into account and not just the completion clause, as is done in the automatic coding algorithms Pattern, Vader, and LIWC. The reason is that we found congruencies between the stability and polarity of the IC verbs in the main clauses and that of the completions. That is to say, the coding of the IC verb main clause and the coding of the completion in the subclause are congruent in terms of stability and polarity. These congruencies could be taken into consideration in determining the stability and polarity of the completion clauses. Culture . The final methodological issues are related to culture, that is, the choice of participants and the language used in the materials. We asked Chinese and Dutch participants as representatives of Eastern and Western cultures. As mentioned before, some of our Chinese participants were overseas students in the Netherlands. It might be argued that they were more Western-oriented and identified less with the Eastern culture than their counterparts who stay mostly in China. This might have deteriorated the effect of the culture variable. To check for the strength of their cultural identification, we administered cultural coherence test to the participants. The scores on this test, however, did not influence the results. When selecting the participants with the strongest cultural identification, we still did not find a significant result of culture. This suggests that using overseas students was not the reason behind the lack of finding effects with culture. We used English as the experiment language in Chapters 2 and 3. English is a second language to both of our participants. It might be argued that the lack of proficiency in English of the participants made them less sensitive to the intricacies related to the events described by the implicit causality bias of the English IC verbs. Our results suggest that this lack of proficiency did not have an influence on the strong effect of the IC bias, but it may have dampened the more subtle effects of the self-serving bias, the intergroup bias, and culture. Preferably then, one would like to present the materials in the native languages of the participants. However, that brings about translation problems. For example, the IC1 verb anger can be translated as ji nu in Chinese and boos maken in Dutch. For the Chinese, the verb ji nu could indicate the NP1 deliberately angered the NP2 because of a negative action that the NP2 had performed, such as in Zhangsan ji nu (angered) Lisi, because [Lisi] had flirted with Zhangsan's girlfriend (CS 3867) . This interpretation probably has led around 26% of the Chinese participants to choose the unbiased NP2 as the causer of the IC verb event (see Chapter 5). In contrast, the Dutch variant of the verb, boos maken, did not seem to have such an interpretation. For instance, in the IC study by Commandeur (2010), that 169 Discussion and conclusionpresented the sentences in Dutch to Dutch participants, the choice for the biased NP1 for the verb was 100%. Because of these subtle differences between languages, we decided to use English as a familiar second language to our participants. Future studies could ask native speakers from different cultures and present the IC verb sentences in their own language. When controlling for translation differences one could repeat our experiments and compare the results cross-culturally. Another approach might be to ask participants to read IC verb sentences in both their native language and in a second language, such as English, and then compare whether and how the IC bias differs between languages and cultures. 6.4 Conclusion This thesis has investigated whether socio-psychological factors influence the IC bias. Our studies have shown that a socio-psychological factor such as the self perspective can modify the IC bias, but we were unable to show the same for other socio-psychological factors, such as culture and group. Furthermore, we did not find clear evidence that sentence structure influences the IC bias. In terms of completions, our studies showed that self perspective influences the stability of the completions. Together, these findings indicate that the influence of socio-psychological factors on the IC bias is only moderate, while that of verb semantics is robust, and most importantly that when people make causal inference in interaction, the importance of language is undeniable. 6RRREFERENCES172 ReferencesAbramson, L.

This thesis addresses how people make a particular type of causal inference based on the implicit causality (IC) of interpersonal verbs. Interpersonal verbs describe events between two protagonists and implicit causality refers to the bias that people may have to attribute the cause of the event to one of the two protagonists. For example, when reading the sentence John annoyed Peter, because... , most people tend to consider John, the first protagonist as the causer of the annoyance. In contrast, when reading a similar sentence like John criticized Peter, because... , most people tend to attribute the cause to Peter, the second protagonist. In the literature on implicit causality, the first protagonist is referred to as the NP1, the first noun phrase, and the second protagonist as the NP2, the second noun phrase. Furthermore, verbs like annoy with a bias to the NP1 are called IC1 verbs, and verbs like criticize with a bias to the NP2 are called IC2 verbs. It has been shown that IC bias is, for the most part, determined by the semantics of the verbs (e.g., Brown & Fish 1983). Yet, it has been discussed that non-semantic factors might also influence the IC bias (Pickering & Majid 2007). And the aim of the thesis is to study how the IC bias is influenced by socio- psychological and syntactic factors. Chapter 1 presents a theoretical background on how the IC bias has been studied in previous literature. As mentioned, the IC bias has been explained in terms of verb semantics. An agent role of agent-patient verbs (e.g., help) is considered as the causer of the action described by the verbs with an IC1 bias. In contrast, a stimulus role of stimulus-experiencer verbs (e.g., annoy) and experiencer-stimulus verbs (e.g., hate) is considered as the causer of the mental states described by the verbs, with an IC1 and IC2 biases, respectively. More recently, the trend has been moved to study how non-semantic factors influence the IC bias. In this thesis, we start from the observation that effects of implicit causality always 'happen' in context when verbs are used in sentences and scenarios. We consider socio-psychological and cultural variables could modify the event types evoked by the IC verbs. We investigate how self-perspective, group membership, a syntactic factor and culture might influence the IC bias. Chapter 2 addresses how self-perspective and culture might influence the IC bias. Most IC studies focus on how people choose the causer from a neutral perspective, that is, readers are onlookers of the events (see Rudolph & F\u00f6rsterling 1997 for a review of IC studies). Different from these studies, we study once people are involved in the event, how they choose the causer, that is, how self-serving bias (SS bias) influences the IC bias. The SS bias is a tendency that people attribute positive events to themselves and that they avoid attributing negative events to themselves, in order to keep a good image of themselves. We hypothesize that this SS bias would influence the IC bias in a way that when people are involved in the IC verb sentences as one of the two protagonists, compared to the scenarios when they are not involved, they would be more likely to avoid choosing themselves as the causer of negative IC verb sentences and more likely to choose themselves as the causer of positive IC verb sentences. We also hypothesize that this tendency would be stronger among Dutch people than Chinese people. This is because this SS bias effect is claimed to be stronger in 'self-enhancing' Western cultures than in Eastern cultures (Mezulis et al. 2014). We present Dutch and Chinese participants with three versions of implicit causality sentences, a version in a neutral perspective (i.e., IC1 verb: Peter amazed John; IC2 verb: 187 SummaryJohn criticized Peter ), and two self perspectives, one in which the self takes up the biased position (biased-self, i.e., NP1 in IC1 verbs I amazed John; NP2 in IC2 verbs John criticized me), and one in which the self does not take up the biased position (non-biased-self, i.e., NP2 in IC1 verbs: Peter IC2 verbs: I criticized Peter ). The sentences are either positive or negative. We ask the participants to choose a causer, to complete the sentences, and to carry out a causal judgment task. The results show that the participants judge sentences with the self-perspective in accordance with the self-serving bias. Culture, however, does not have an effect. The findings show that the IC bias is influenced by the self perspective, and that the effect of culture on the IC bias is not strong in linguistic measures. Chapter 3 further examines the influence of self-perspective and culture, and extends the research with group membership. Apart from the SS bias, group membership has been believed to influence how people interact with each other (Tajfel & Turner 1979). People tend to favor ingroup over outgroup, or to disfavor outgroup over ingroup, an intergroup bias (IG bias), in order to keep a good group relationship. This IG bias is claimed to be stronger among Eastern people than Western people, because Eastern cultures are collectivistic- oriented, while Western cultures are individualistic-oriented (Hofstede 1980; 2001). The aim of the chapter is to investigate to what extent the IG bias would modify the IC bias. We present Dutch and Chinese participants, as representatives of Western and Eastern cultures, respectively, with the two self perspectives of implicit causality sentences in scenarios. In the scenarios, the other protagonist is manipulated either as an ingroup or an outgroup member to the participants. We limit ourselves to only negative IC verb sentences, because the literature indicate that it is more likely to find an effect of group membership for negative events. We ask the participants to choose a causer and to complete the sentences. The results again confirm the effect of the self perspective in accordance with the SS bias. However, the results do not support the effect of culture or group membership. The findings suggest that when the SS bias is in conflict with the IG bias, the motivation to protect a good self-image might be stronger than that to maintain a good group relationship. Chapter 4 is concerned with how self perspective, culture, group, and polarity, might influence types of causes people make. Many IC studies have asked participants to complete IC verb sentences and have only focused on the choices that people made in IC verb sentences, as we do in Chapters 2 and 3. Very few studies, however, have focused on the type of causes the participants provide in the completions and how the completions relate to the IC verbs. We study how the socio-psychological factors in previous chapters influence the linguistic characteristics of completions of IC verb sentences, in particular stability and polarity. We focus on analyzing the relation between the polarity of IC verbs and the stability of the completions of the IC verb sentences both automatically and manually. Results show that in negative IC verb sentences, participants tend to produce fewer stable completions with them than others being causers, supporting an SS bias effect. In positive IC verb sentences, we did not find such a pattern. The relatively stronger effect in the negative IC verb sentences than in the positive IC verb sentences is in line with a general phenomenon that negativity triggers a stronger effect than positivity (Baumeister et al. 2001). Moreover, the tendency to produce fewer stable completions when people themselves are causers is weaker among Chinese participants than Dutch participants, supporting a weaker SS bias S188 Summaryin Eastern cultures than Western cultures. Yet, we do not find evidence supporting the IG bias influencing the completions. Furthermore, we find that positive IC verbs trigger more stable completions than negative IC verbs. This is in line with findings from Beukenboom and Semin (2006) that positivity leads to more heuristic or global processing while negativity triggers a more detail-oriented processing style. Together, these findings suggest that some of the socio-psychological factors in previous chapters influence the IC bias in a subtle way in terms of the types of causes in completions. Chapter 5 investigates how sentence structures influence the IC bias. Two typical Chinese sentence structures are used: a direct object NP in a subject verb object (SVO) structure and an NP preceded by a co-verb in a subject co-verb object verb (SCOV) structure. Compared to the SVO structure, the object in the SCOV structure has been assumed to be either upgraded or downgraded (Cheng & Almor 2017a; Zhan et al. 2020). Chinese participants are asked to read Chinese IC verb sentences in these two sentence structures using a completion task and a choice task. The results do not show a strong effect of sentence structure on the IC bias. We only find a weak effect that the participants tend to choose the object in the SVO structure more often than in the SCOV structure in weak IC1 verb sentences. The findings suggest more support for the downgrading than the upgrading influence of the SCOV structure on the IC bias, compared to the SVO structure. We believe the weak modifying effect of the SCOV sentence structure might be because the object in the structure is oblique and less accessible than that in the SVO structure. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes the thesis with a discussion on the main findings in the thesis related to the existing IC theories. The thesis confirms the determining role of verb semantics in the IC bias. The thesis also shows a modifying effect of non-semantic factors on either the IC bias strength or the types of causes people provide for IC verb sentences. The thesis shows support of a modifying effect of self perspective on the IC bias strength, in accordance with the self-serving bias effect. However, the thesis does not show such support for the influence of group membership or culture on the IC bias strength. Yet, a further investigation on linguistic characteristics of the completions of the IC verb sentences suggests that some of the non-semantic factors, i.e., self perspective, culture, and polarity of IC verbs, influence the stability of causes that people provide for interpersonal events evoked by the IC verbs. Moreover, we find a weak effect that sentence structure might influence the IC bias strength in Chinese: people tend to choose the objects in the SCOV structure less often than in the SVO structure in weak IC1 verb sentences. In sum, this thesis shows that when people consider causes of interpersonal events, they are influenced by socio-psychological factors. In order to better understand the IC bias, it is worthwhile to study not only the IC bias strength as indicated by referential choices in the IC verb sentences, but also by the types of causes people provide for the IC verb sentences. Yet, it is undeniable that the semantics of verbs is the dominant factor that determines how people consider the causes. This means that language plays an important role in causal inferences in interpersonal interaction. 189 Summary SAAACKNOWLEDGMENTS192 AcknowledgmentsThe PhD project is not the easiest journey that a person would experience. I was told that many times in the past years during my PhD project. Even Tilburg university has recently started to host a session for PhD students to share (fear of) failure and adversity in their study. I agree that finishing the thesis was not easy. But luckily, I had great support from many people, and I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards them. First and foremost, I want to express my utmost gratitude to my highly esteemed thesis committee: Dr. E. Oversteegen, Dr. Y . Gu, Prof. dr. J.A.L. Hoeken, Prof. dr. M.G.J. Swerts, and Prof. dr. E.J. Krahmer. I have long admired your work and I am really honored to have you as my committee members. I am extremely thankful for your time and efforts evaluating my thesis. I consider it as a privilege that I has been given the opportunity to discuss my thesis with you on March 10th. Next, I am extremely grateful to Alfons Maes and Reiner Cozijn, my supervisors. Without you two, it would not be possible for me to finish the thesis. When writing the thesis, no matter how many pages I sent to you, you could reply to me next day and commented on the most important points that could be improved. In the comments, Fons, you always encouraged me to think about why-questions. In this way, you encouraged me to argue choices I made throughout the thesis from a high theoretical level instead of a low technical level. Also, you are a visualization expert. You have taught me with great patience about the importance of a clear table or a clear graph. I am so grateful to you, Fons! I truly admire your work ability. I wish I could grow into a person that is as insightful and efficient as you are. Rein is someone that I could not thank enough. I started the program because of your help. Throughout the years, academically, you always helped me to formulate my vague ideas to a clear plan. You could use vivid examples to help me understand how to formulate ideas in a way that readers could understand them without confusion. Sometimes, when I struggled with thinking from a high level as Fons encouraged, Rein, you were like a bridge that helped me to achieve that aim. Life-wise, you are more than just an understanding supervisor. Every time when I was in a difficulty situation, you did not hesitate to help. You comforted me with your own stories, e.g., how you grew from a young student to now an associate professor, and how you did not give up looking for love and finally found your wife Sylvia. This year, I was very honored to be a guest at your wedding. I am very lucky to have both you and Fons as my supervisors. I am also grateful to my dear paranymphs: Annemarie and Marie. I had so much nice time with both of you in our office D407. Annemarie, I truly admire your calmness. Whenever a negative thing happened, you never got annoyed and quickly found a solution. And you always offered help before I asked. Thanks a lot! Marie, I admire that you are truly open-minded to people from different cultural backgrounds. I really enjoyed all stories you told me about cultural differences between the Netherlands and Germany. I was also very happy that we could have pep talks when it came to job hunting. I am greatly thankful for support from both of you! Apart from my supervisors and my paranymphs, I am extremely proud of having so many admirable colleagues at our Department of Communication and Cognition. I learned how to teach statistics from Joost (Schilperoord). From you, I realize statistics does not have to be abstract and difficult. Instead, statistics could be vivid and fun. Now I am a statistics 193 Acknowledgmentslecturer. Hope one day I could be a lecturer as good as you are. Also, I would like to thank Emiel (van Miltenburg) for your help in automatic analysis of completions in Chapter 4. For the same chapter, I also thank Thom Siewertsen for your help in coding the variable of stability. When it came to an end phase of the PhD thesis, I was very lucky to get help with job hunting from many friendly colleagues, and I want to express my sincerest thanks to them: Marjolijn, Phoebe, Joost (Verhoeven), Connie, Tatiana, Jan (Engelen), and Christine. To Lauraine and Jacqueline, two nice ladies at our department, I want to express truly thanks for your accompanies. Especially during covid, your ladies made me feel I was not alone. Of course, there are numerous other colleagues that I have received help in terms of thesis writing or teaching throughout years, e.g., David, Martijn, Jos, Peter, Neil, Renske, Loes, Ruud, Maria (Mos), Juli\u00ebtte, Diana, Alex, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, Carel, Per and Lane. To (previous) PhD students at our department, I feel we kind of grew up together during our PhD journeys. We shared many interesting academic ideas. We also had nice dinners together. Especially, those who were or still are in PhD rooms: Emmelyn, Debby, Ruben, Tess, Nadine (van der Waal), Kim, Anouck, and Linwei. I am very grateful for having you guys as my study buddies during my PhD journey. Apart from study, I have met friends that I would never expect to be so lucky to have in the Netherlands. Naomi, Thanks a lot for your accompany since I came to Tilburg. Weekly language sessions between us at Talent Square made me feel I started to integrate in the country. I am extremely lucky to have you as a close friend here! Saskia, we met during our master program at Utrecht University. Back then, my arm was injured, and I could not wear a jacket because of the injured arm. You brought a shoulder scarf. It warmed not only my body but also my heart. From then on, you have continuously helped me. I am really grateful to you! Yuqing Zhou, with you, I felt so nice that I could have someone that I could chat in Chinese and shared all inner thoughts. And you have never hesitated to support me throughout the years. Thank you very much! Nastya, without you, it was impossible for me to finish my master program. During the year we lived together at a student apartment, you took great care of me. Back then, I was frustrated with surgeries and the injured arm. You saved me from being depressed during that year. Not mention that you keep helping me after we moved out of the student apartment. For all of those, I owe you a lot! De Zoeten family, words cannot express my thanks to all of you. Emily, you have been such an understanding friend since we met each other during our master program. Especially during the year when we co-rented an apartment at de bilt, I learned a lot from you. You always support me and encourage me, especially when I feel a bit unconfident. I am super lucky to have you as my close friend. Remi, you always offer to help me with programming. Also, you have shared many interesting thoughts about international politic topics based on data. You are a truly insightful person. Jan is also of the same type. When people around me started to get a bit nervous about Covid, you, as a senior researcher and a PhD supervisor in the field of medicine, could let me be aware of data published on latest international medical journals and calmed me down. Jan's calmness also passes on to the other kids in A194 Acknowledgmentsthe family: David and Martine. I admire you guys' courage to explore the world, even if you encountered difficulties. Last but not least, Claudine, you are the most independent lady I have ever seen. You have never hesitated to help people. I am extremely lucky to be one of the people that you help. You have kept great care of me and regularly asks how things are going with me, just like a mom. You always invite me to your place and prepare same things for me as for your own kids. Whenever I encounter a problem, you always help me to clear my mind and think of a solution. I am really grateful for having all of you De Zoeten as my family in the Netherlands. Ralph, I am very lucky to meet you at the final phase of my study. You have been super sweet to me. Although you are fond of staying in Den Bosch (forever), you are not afraid of exploring a new culture with me in China during holidays. Most importantly, you are able to understand things from my perspective. Lenny, Ralph's understanding ability is probably from you. When it came to an issue between Ralph and me, you could understand from both sides and used your own experience to tell me that I should not give up too much to lose myself. Instead, you told me that I should just tell your son Ralph \"I understand you. But this is who I am and accept it or not\", a great mom! My family in China is very much looking forward to seeing your family. To my friends back in China, I want to express great thanks to Qian Zhang and Rui Wang. Qian, we met each other back in high school. From then on, you have never stopped supporting me. Even when you were on duty as a doctor in a hospital, you would still spare time calling me on a Chinese New Year, so that I would not feel alone abroad. I am so lucky to have you as a close friend. Rui Wang, I am very happy to meet you during our work. People said it would be difficult having a friend after school. You showed it wrong. I feel we can share every thought, even if we are in two countries. My final words of utmost gratitude go out to my family in China. Without Yuhua Yang, my mom, and Zuqing Xia, my dad, I could not come to the Netherlands. You two have given me unconditional love and support throughout the years. To my sister Yun Xia and my brother-in-law Wei Xiang, you two have also supported me without any hesitation. To Zuguo Xia, my uncle, you have never hesitated to finance my study since I was a kid. To Xiaofang Yang, my cousin, you are my life mentor and have always taken great care of me. Similarly, Qingwei Zhou, another cousin, you have given lots of advice on my study from middle school, and I followed your path to the same university in China. I truly appreciate all of you! This summer, I can finally go home to see all of you with the diploma!195 Acknowledgments Hans Stol. A framework for evidence-based policy making using IT. Promotor: H.J. van den Herik.
