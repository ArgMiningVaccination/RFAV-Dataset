In addition, while on this trip, students will also be challenged to recognize the significance and correlation of school related subject areas with that of such an establishment (i.e. amusement park). For example, providing students an exciting and thrilling experience outside of what they may be typically exposed to, can ground their knowledge of physics principles in a relevant context at an amusement park, leading to an increase in student 'buy-in' as well as interest in the STEM fields.120 Non Catered Valid thru 6-3012 One Day Comp Valid thur6-303 One Day Parking 1 Processing Fee0205 RECREATIONALDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OF PARKS OF PARKS OF AND RECREATION$79.99 PO6048116/6/2019STAR OFFICE PRODUCTS INCGiant 2 in 1 Four In A Row & CheckersItem #: BSR-W129190205 RECREATIONALDEPARTMENT OF AND 1.0 Electric Hover : OF PARKS AND RECREATION$153.98 PO6048116/6/2019STAR OFFICE Egg & Spoon (set 6)Item #: BSR-W92350205 OF OF PARKS AND RECREATION$118.10 PO6048136/6/2019SKY LLC Building Connector Set set)Item LR14740205 and PO6048136/6/2019SKY LLC DBA/US OFFICE SOLSpectrum Jumbo Ostrich Eggs and Spoon (set of 6)Item #: W92350205 RECREATIONALDEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND and Plate AND RECREATION$161.16 PO6048136/6/2019SKY and Shapes PARKS AND RECREATION$189.42 PO6048136/6/2019SKY Craft Kit AND RECREATION$294.80 PO6048136/6/2019SKY Cannon Craft Kit 12)Item GP31760205 OF PARKS Boards Slap Bracelets PARKS AND RECREATION$675.12 Frames RECREATION$189.12 PO6048136/6/2019SKY LLC Projects Easy Pack 90)Item AP2510205 OF PARKS Train Fitness Ray Sulphite Construction Colors) AND RECREATION$131.52 PO6048136/6/2019SKY LLC DBA/US OFFICE SOLColor Splash Giant Box of Sidewalk Chalk (126 per box)Item #:SC8770205 RECREATIONALDEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION$82.20 AND Building Rope Course -- 75 people0205 COLUMBIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS$4,875.00 PO6051216/12/2019SKY LLC DBA/US OFFICE SOLMulti Kid$ Value Plus Always Be Joyful Rug 6ft x 9ft0205 RECREATIONALDEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION$1,139.84 PO6051216/12/2019SKY LLC DBA/US OFFICE SOLRed/Blue Childrens Factory 3 Section infection Control Rest Mat Pack0205 RECREATIONALDEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION$6,823.50 PO6051216/12/2019SKY LLC DBA/US OFFICE SOLMulti Kid$ Value Plus Always Be Joyful Rug 6ft x 9ft0205 RECREATIONALDEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION$1,709.76 LAKESHORE JUMBO LYNNETTE E GIBSON Raymond Elementary SchoolPhone: 1(202)576-6236PO NOT TO EXCEED $1,995.00PO VALID FROM DATE OF AWARD THROUGH 09/30/20190205 RECREATIONALDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS$1,995.00 PO5988401/18/2019ARI PHOENIX INC.Truck lift and related services0206 MEDICAL SERVICES$8,373.61 PO595496-V22/15/2019PRAXAIR AUTOMOTIVEFIRE AND EMERGENCY PO6009563/8/2019FIRST VEHICLE SERVICES INC.Seagrave and support services0206 AUTOMOTIVEFIRE AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES$29,000.00 PO595324-V23/15/2019LAWSON PRODUCTS, INC.Automotive hardware0206 AUTOMOTIVEFIRE AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES$0.01 PO6055476/24/2019LAWSON PRODUCTS, INC.FY19 funding for the purchase of parts against BPA open.

OCTFME has the responsibility to program three channels, twenty four hours a day, 365 days a year. As the agency increases its programming offerings, studio productions and facilities usage, additional resources are needed to accommodate the demands. During FY18, the agency invested in the expansion of its tech core to allow for additional sources and destinations to be added to the network infrastructure. Now complete, OCTFME can now pursue the acquisition of equipment that will contribute to the facility buildout. The expansion to maximize space usage, media retrieval, automation, and production opportunities are needed for the planned buildout of its second studio and control room, which is currently unused. Upon acquiring the property in 2014, one studio was built out, leaving the other for future use. OCTFME\u00bfs video broadcast and production operation relies on core equipment to capture, store and retrieve media on a daily basis. The equipment constantly evolves as technology provides opportunities for higher quality and enhanced efficiencies in overall operations. To maintain the level of quality and effective in service the agency seeks to replace core components to capture, (studio cameras); store, (storage expansion), and retrieval, (clip library). 0704 PURCHASES - OTHER EQUIPMENTOFFICE OF CABLE TELEVISION, FILM, MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT$880,000.00PO602708-V25/2/2019W W GRAINGER INCThe District of Columbia Office of Contracting and Procurement, on behalf of the D.C Department of Corrections is seeking a vendor to procure equipment and supplies for the Facility Management Services at the Central Detention Facility (CDF) and the Correctional Treatment Facility (CTF).
