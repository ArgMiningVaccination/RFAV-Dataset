After 8 years of laboratory research and testing, Dr. Charles Brusch and Rene Caisse, along with a staff of scientists, found the key to greatly improve the efficacy of Essiac. Testing concluded that each of the four herbs has a \"sister herb\" known as \"potentiators\". These 4 additional herbs can augment, improve the potency and extend the medicinal value of the formula. The 8 herb version of Essiac is stronger, more effective, longer lasting and yields the best results. "}
