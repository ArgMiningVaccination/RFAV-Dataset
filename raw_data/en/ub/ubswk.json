This project was originally approved for $1,300,000 for design professional services from the Capital Renovation Fund in the Approval of Consent Docket o n February 16, 2021. For the project described below, UNM Hospital requests the following actions, with action requeste d only upon requisite sequential approval and recommendation by any and all committees and bodies: Board of Trustee Finance Committee approval of and recommendation of approval to the UNMH Board of Trustees. UNMH Board of Trustees approval of and recommen dation of approval to the UNM Board of Regents HSC Committee. UNM Board of Regents HSC Committee approval and recommendation of approval to the UNM Board of Regents. UNM Board of Regents approval PROJECT DESCRIPTION: In collaboration with Bernalillo Count y, UNM Hospital plans to design and construct a new building on the University Psychiatric Center (UPC) campus for use as a Crisis Triage Center. This includes demolition of the building currently used by Program for Children and Adolescents (PFCA) and Physician Access Line Service (PALS). These programs are planned for relocation to 1031 Lamberton NE. The Crisis Triage Center is intended to provide development of crisis triage services in our community with a physical connection to existing resources co-located on the University Psychiatric Center campus. The project program include s, but is not limited to ,: Two patient wings with eight patient beds each, support services areas, offices, law enforcement a reas, and modifications required to meet the most current code requirements. The project program ming is expanded to include the Peer Living Room Model resulting in a combined programmatic building gross square footage (BGSF) of 20,147. [Please note a separate request will be submitted for the Psychiatri c Emergency Services (PES) program to be included in this building . The two requests are submitted separately as the PES program is a UNM Hospital project absent Bernalillo County Funding. ] RATIONALE: Significant gaps exist in the crisis continuum of car e in Bernalillo County. Although crisis services exist, clients are often contemplating next steps once they have been evaluated in the emergency room or inpatient facility. Due to medical necessity criteria, many patients in need of continued stabilizatio n 9/53 are deferred care until they are able to conn ect with outpatient services and continue to rotate through the emergency services creating a cyclical pattern. In addition to the need for continued stabilization, centralized triage , observat ion, and tri age services are in high demand in order to facilitate a full continuum of crisis services . The crisis continuum is further expanded with the inclusion of the Peer Living Room Model (PLR) . This model has demonstrated efficacy in the use of certified peer s upport workers and peer volunteers in providing the following services: de -escalation during crises, short -term goal setting, safety plan development, teaching coping skills, connecting with community and hospital resources, medical and behavioral health s ystem navigation, job search and employment preparation, supportive coaching, etc. within a drop -in setting. The current request expands funding for the inclusion of design of the Peer Living Room Model by the county into the program and expands the build ing by 1,680 building gross square feet ( BGSF) for a total of 20,147 BGSF. This request also captures the costs of omissions from the original request for indirect costs necessary to support the project design effort including but not limited to: surveying services, asbestos testing and reporting, geotechnical investigations, commissioning services, subsurface utility investigations and LEED Consulting services. PURCHASING PROCESS: Procurement of the LEED and commissioning Consulting services will utilize Limited Solicitations with UNMH On-Call Contracts, and small purchase requests in accordance with procurement thresholds . Amendment to design services for inclusion of the Peer Living Room Model would utilize an existing design professional contract execut ed via a Request for Proposals (RFP) 2256 -21 with McClain + Yu Architecture and Design. FUNDING: Total indirect costs , which includes the design budget , for this project shall not to exceed $2,900,000 from the Capital Renovation Fund and Bernalillo Co unty. This is an increase of $1,600,000 from the original $1,300,000 request approved for design services on the February 16, 2021 Consent Docket. 10/53 CAPITAL PROJECT RE-APPROVAL PROJECT NAME : Psychiatric Emergency Services DATE: September 2021 RECOMMENDED ACTION: As required by Section 7.12 of Board of Regents Policy Manual, the New Mexico Higher Education Department and the New Mexico State B oard of Finance, capital project approval is being presented for approval for the Psychiatric Emergency Service s (PES) project . For the project described below, UNM Hospitals requests the following actions, with action requested only upon requisite sequen tial approval and recommendation by any and all committees and bodies: Board of Trustee Finance Committee approval of and recommendation of approval to the UNMH Board of Trustees. UNMH Board of Trustees approval of and recommendation of approval to the UN M Board of Regents HSC Committee. UNM Board of Regents HSC Committee approval and recommendation of approval to the UNM Board of Regents. UNM Board of Regents approval PROJECT DESCRIPTION: UNM Hospital is proposing the inclusion of the Psychiatric Emergen cy Services (PES) function into the Crisis Triage Center (CTC) to promote synergy and maximize resources . The addition of PES to the building will be tracked and funded separately from the CTC . Funding will be from the UNM Hospital Capital Renovations Fun d. The Crisis Triage Center is intended to provide crisis triage services in our community with a physical connection to existing services co -located on the UNM Psychiatric Center campus. The inclusion of PES programmatic component includes , but is not limited to , the following: ten patient rooms with flexibility to serve a differing census of pediatric and adult population, seclusion suite with two patient rooms, utilization of the same law enforcement areas with entrances, and required support service a reas to meet the most current code requirements. The request further includes a second floor cold -shell space to facilitate a future programmatic build out to meet expansion of behavioral health services on the UNM Psychiatric Campus. RATIONALE: PES is the only 24 -hour a day, 7 -days a week Psychiatr ic Emergency Room in New Mexico and serves clients who present acute psychiatric care levels and are identified as at risk to self and/or others . The Psychiatric Emergency Service primarily services the Albuque rque Metropolitan a rea and draws patients from Bernalillo, Sandoval and Valencia counties . PES has experienced a higher demand for its services than had been projected during the 2019 consideration of PES renovations. The current PES capacity constraints and associated overflow results in a burden on the existing UNMH Emergency Department. Patients treated in the Emergency Room with an acute psychiatric need require additional staffing for 1:1 supervision. The inclusion of PES within CTC would allow expans ion of services to accommodate patient care demand. Currently, PES contains six patient rooms without providing separation of adult and pediatric patient rooms or restrooms. Proposed separation of patient populations with centralized staff increases safet y, and provides necessary support areas that are not currently included in the space. 11/53 UNMH is recommending inclusion of PES into the new CTC . This will allow for expanded services t o accommodate patient care demand and facility design to meet the requi red healthcare occupancy. PES co-located with the CTC provides a synergy between the services with a consistent level of care. The inclusion of PES within CTC will better serve our community and streamline the intake process minimizing significant gaps e xisting in the crisis continuum to provide a more robust level of care in Bernalillo County . UNMH is requesting a second floor cold shell to facilitate possible future expansion at the UNM Psychiatric Center campus . The ability to pursue a cold shell conc urrent with the requested design is advantageous as it utilizes structural efficiencies inherent in the design to support vertical construction , creates a continuous building envelope with decreased total roof area , which reduces energy demands, and requir es minimal utility upsizing compared to a standalone facility. This approach allows for rapid programmatic growth while reducing construction costs. This consideration allows for flexibility to meet future facility needs and aligns with UNMH's long term pl anning approach for this campus. The addition of the Psychiatric Emergency services would expand the CTC building by 6,461 building gross square feet ( BGSF). The second -floor cold shell would add approximately 18,000 BGSF , for a total of 44,608 BGSF. This request is inclusive of indirect costs necessary to support the project design effort including but limited to: surveying services, asbestos testing and reporting, geotechnical investigations, commissioning services, and LEED Consulting services to me et or exceed Governor's Executive Order 2006 -001 for minimum LEED Silver Certification USGBC. PURCHASING PROCESS: Procurement of the LEED and commissioning Consulting services shall be done utilizing Limited Solicitations with UNMH On -Call Contracts, and small purchase requests in accordance with procurement thresholds. Amendment to design services for inclusion of Psychiatric Emergency Services and Cold -Shell second floor would utilize an existing design professional contract executed via a Request for Pr oposals (RFP) 2256 -21 with McClain + Yu Architecture and Design. FUNDING: Total indirect costs , includ ing the design budget for this project , shall not to exceed $1,750,000 from the Capital Renovation Fund . 12/53 CAPITAL PROJECT RE-APPROVAL PROJECT NAME : CIP 3157 UH Main 2nd Floor Sterile Processing Department - Decontamination Renovation.

The original project scope includes the expansion of the existing Decontamination Space to create improv ed access and work flow areas. The expansion will provide much need ed additional space to properly don and doff personal protection equipment and improve the processing circulation . Existing mechanical unit upgrade s were also included to ensure proper airflow , air exchange, and exhaust to maintain negative air pressures. As the renovation work has progressed, several unforeseen conditions have been identified which requires additional work to include but not limited to: sewer pipe replacement due to compromised conditions, asbestos remediation, wall reconstruction, new f looring, and temporary facilities to accommodate a mobile sterile processing unit as required to maintain hospital processing demand. These corrections will improve the workflow , condition, and safety with in the Sterilization Processing Department. RATI ONALE: The work is based on increased demand and volume in the Sterile Pro cessing Department as well as compliance with The Joint Commission guidelines.

UNM Board of Regents approval PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Construction services are needed to renovate and construct addition al square footage to increase the patient waiting area and provide a cold shell building expansion for three operating rooms to provide surgical eye procedures in the future. This renovation and addition will allow for reorganization of the patient entrance and improve access throughout the clinic. Additional exam and diagno stic rooms will be added to provide for increased patient throughput while reducing the wait times for appointments. Correct ions to code deficie ncies necessitated by the Facility Guidelines Institute (FGI) recommendations and the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) regulations will also be completed as part of the project . The work will correct Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA ) violations by providing compliant spatial configuration for patient check -in and reception area s. The project will include reconfigur ing patient restrooms to comply with ADA requirements . Lastly , finishes will be updated in the remodeled areas. RATIONALE: This clinic is in a newl y acquired building that does not meet current code in a number of areas . Correction of these deficiencies are required to address patient throughput concerns, improve spatial and programmatic efficiencies, increase throughput and enhance staff and patient experience. PURCHASING PROCESS: The construction project will be procured through a RFP for construction. Professional design services procured through an RFP for Professional Services.

Certain identity requirements; 2. State and county residency requirements; 3. Is not covered or is only partially covered by government or private insurance; and 4. Established financial requirements for establishing indigent status, defined as 300% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines or below ; 5. Medical necessity criteria and 6.

Individuals will be screened for indigent status and financial assistance if the patient has no other healthcare coverage. Screening will occur at each Self Pay encounter or at least annually. Patient will be determined eligib le when documentation is submitted to UNM Hospital Financial Services Department. As UNM Care is not a fund for payment of medical services but rather a financial a ssistance program, medical services rendered to patients outside the UNM Hospital are not payable by UNM Hospital.

UNM Hospital Bad Debt Policy Applies To: UNMH Responsible Department: Board of Trustees Revised: 9/21/21 Title: Program Policy Patient Policy Owner: Board of Trustees Effective Date: 09/21/21 Page 2 of 4 IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES Identity Requirements A patient seeking financial assistance under the UNM Care program must provide documenta tion to demonstrate his or her identity. Any of the following documents may demonstrate identity: Social Security card, U.S. Passport, state -issued identification, birth certificates, citizenship/naturalization records, Visa, Indian census records, certif icate of Indian Blood, court records, voter registration card, divorce papers, licensed school records, licensed day care center records or a letter from a licensed physician or nurse. Residency Requirements To be eligible for financial assistance und er the UNM Care program, the patient must be living in New Mexico and demonstrate an intention to remain in the state. Residency in New Mexico and Bernalillo County is established by living in the state and county and carrying out the types of activities associated with normal living: such as occupying a home, enrolling children in school, attaining a New Mexico driver's license or New Mexico State issued identification card, renting a post office box, obtaining employment within Bernalillo County or the S tate of New Mexico. The patient can demonstrate this residency by bank statements, home ownership, rental leases, and letters addressed to the patient at a home address, utility bills, and proof of enrollment of self or child in an educational institut ion, pay stubs, income tax returns, or other similar documents. Patients who meet residency requirements for the State, but are not residents of Bernalillo County, will only be eligible for indigent status and financial assistance if the service they ar e to receive or have received at the UNM Hospital is not available in their county of residence, as determined by the Medical Staff of UNM Hospital. These patients should apply for their home county indigent funds before applying for coverage under the UN M Care financial assistance program. Financial Requirements The patient must verify income by providing: employment pay stubs; income tax returns; letter from employers; direct bank deposits; letters or copies of checks from Social Security, Worker's Compensation, Veteran's Affairs, Bureau of Indian affairs, or other similar documents. Homeless patients and patients in Bankruptcy will meet the definition of this requirement. The patient must verify assets. Assets may be verified by providing bank s tatements, investment statements or other similar documents. Retirement funds, primary residence, and vehicles are not considered in the asset level. Medical Necessity Criteria Only medically necessary services, as determined by the treating UNM Hospi tal medical staff provider, will be eligible for coverage under the UNM Care financial assistance program. All services are subject to review by the Medical Director of the Utilization Review Department. Certain undocumented patients meeting the criter ia outlined below should continue to screened for Emergency Services for Aliens (EMSA) as part of their coverage: 36/53_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Title: Financial Assistance Program Policy Owner: Board of Trustees Effective Date: 09/21/21 Page 3 of 4 1. A patient is treated for an emergency medical condition, as determined and documented by the treating provider; 2. A patient is treated for the signs or symptoms of a communicable disease, as determined and documented by their treating provider, whether or not those symptoms are caused by a communicable disease; or 3. A patient is treated for immunizations, as documented in the medical record. The following are services that are typically not considered covered services within the meaning of this Policy: cosmetic surgery, reversal of vasectomy, elective pregnancy terminations, tuboplasty infertility studies and treatment, other services not routinely provided by UNMH medical staff or facilities as determined by the medical staff of UNM Hospitals.(for example, liver or cardiac transplantation) Exceptions to non -covered services will be considered by the Medical Director of the service in question and Chief Medical Officer. Other Coverage With limited exceptions as described below, the UNM Care financial assistance program is the financial program of last resort. This means that third party governmen t or private insurance will be a primary financial payment source before the UNM Care financial assistance program will be applied. Medicaid -eligible individuals must apply for Medicaid and receive a denial of eligibility prior to being considered for in digent status and financial assistance. Notwithstanding, Indian Health Service Contract health coverage is secondary to the UNM Care financial assistance program for those Native Americans who reside in Bernalillo County and who meet the financial assista nce and medical necessity criteria. A patient can be eligible for indigent status and financial assistance with respect to any unpaid amounts after the third party government or private insurance has fully paid UNM Hospital as required under the terms o f that third party government or private insurance plan. UNM Hospital will subrogate with a liability payer for third party tortfeasor cases. Denial and Appeal Process A patient will receive a letter from UNM Hospital if the patient is denied eligi bility for participation in the UNM Care financial assistance program for any reason. If a patient is not granted indigent status or financial assistance because of lack of documentation for identity, residency, income, asset or medical necessity reasons, they can appeal that decision to the 37/53_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Title: Financial Assistance Program Policy Owner: Board of Trustees Effective Date: 09/21/21 Page 4 of 4 Medical Director of the Utilization Review Department and the UNM Hospital Chief Medical Officer.

September 24, 2021 Good Morning Board of Trustees members and CEO Becker. First, I want to thank Dr. Michael Richards, our Senior Vice President of Clinical Affairs, for being able to read my summary report to you all. This morning I am presenting to the State's Legislative Finance Committee (LFC) in Santa Fe, and I am sorry that I will not be able to join you in person today . Since our last meeting two months ago, I am very grateful for all the hard work of our leaders, faculty, staff, students, volunteers, and teams across our Health System and Health Sciences. We continue to p ush critical and strategic initiatives forward. I want to again thank Dr. Martha Cole McGrew for her many years of service to UNM in numerous leadership roles, including as she now retires at the end of September as Interim Dean for the School of Medicin e. We are in the midst of a national search for the new Dean with many excellent candidates already having been nominated and expressing interest. I want to thank Dr. Richards for stepping into the interim Dean role starting October 1st as he continues in his SVP for Clinical Affairs with some modifications and delegation of those responsibilities. This mon th is Hispanic Heritage Month. I hope you all are able to join us in one of our celebratory activities that started last week and will be running through the 15th of October. The activities are posted on our HSC website and links are included in our newsletter updates . Mandating Vaccines Across all of UNM: Since our last meeting, the FDA has approved the Pfizer vaccine, which lif ted the Emergency Use Authorization, and Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has made a Public Health Order to requir e vaccination s for all health system employees. All of UNM is now requiring vaccinations or to have a medical or religious exemption with routi ne COVID testing. This has been a complex process; however, we all have done extremely well with almost all the HSC becoming vaccinated or having an exemption. Overall at UNM, 86.1% of staff, 93.4% of faculty, and 74.6% of students are fully vaccinated ag ainst COVID -19 and have reported their vaccination status . Lots of gratitude and thanks to the many leaders and peer influencers who have helped us achieve th ese outcomes already. We have had very few s eparations from the organization as a result of this mandate, but those numbers remain low and have not impacted staffing levels. These are difficult times to manage a public health crisis that persists and is changing everything. Health System and Health Matters updates CEO Becker and Drs. Agostini, Ch icarelli, and Boyd will next provide important health system details in their administrative reports; however, I wanted to update you on f our items: Health Equity, COVID stressors, New Clinic and Program Openings, and the NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center r enewal. 40/532 1. The focus on health equity and patient experience and access is vital to our improving t he health of all New Mexicans. We have a terrific \"pre -planning team\" that has made progress and been engaging many community leaders in how we might approac h this topic, including expanding the participants in a new planning group that is inclusive of community, state, counties, cities, and our faculty, staff, and students in the planning of a Health Equity Summit later this year. 2. We continue to be concerned about COVID and the delta variant and the likely new variants in the future. The increase of cases is putting additional burdens and stressors on our already stressed workforce and t here isn't much relief in the hospitals as we continue to be over capacity. We are increasing programming and support for faculty, staff, and student wellness and this might be a topic for future BOT meetings. Also, I do want to take a moment to encourage you, and everyone, to receive your flu shot. Our Fiesta de Flu campaign is off and running and we will continue to mandate the flu vaccine for all those working in and around the clinical setting. 3. Since we last saw each other we have celebrated the opening of the new Rio Grande Clinic in Rio Rancho. Others may share more about this event and the site - but I wanted to share how terrific the community leaders were in all the steps leading up to the clinic opening and in their enthusiasm at the ribbon cutting event. This UNM Medical Group primary care clinic will fill a void in that community. We also continue to look forward to the opening on the new Center of Excellence for Orthopaedic Care and Rehabilitation and the opening of the Nene and Jamie Koch Movement Disorders Center being built just outside these doors on North campus. 4. We also announced this week that the National Cancer Institute has renewed the UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center designation for another five years. We continue to be the only NCI designated institution in the state, a critica l component of the world -class care and research happening in our adult cancer center. Government Relations In the past month, there were several important government relations meetings. These were very informative and provided new insights for all of u s in attendance. First, U.S. Senator Ben Ray Lujan and his team have been working tirelessly on an important new funding proposal which would increase support for having people of color have more opportunities to join clinical trials for Alzheimer's and other illnesses with Memory Difficulties. These illnesses are disproportionately increased in people of color, especially blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Many community leaders and UNM leaders met to review see our clinical services and to discus s this important legislation. I want to thank Vice President for Research, Dr. Richard Larson, our UNM Government Relations Office, and UNM Hospital CEO Kate Becker , as well as Senator Ben Ray Lujan and his team, for organizing and facilitating that meeti ng. 41/533 Second, w e also h ad a great all-day visit last week with our colleagues at the Legislative Finance Committee (LFC) which included an important tour of the Children's Psychiatric Center , which we are asking for $40Million to build a new facility of about 24,500 GSF , to demolish the extremely dated current facility, and to be completed by November 2025. There were very thoughtful questions and concerns about how child and transition age y outh services are coordinated pre and post hospitalization. Today I am speaking with the LFC about this request and many others. This new facility will enable the needed high-quality inpatient care services, better efficiencies, and abilities to manage behavioral ICU situations. We are also hoping this will lead to a focus on enhancing pre / post hospitalization care, coordination of resources, enhanced partial hospitalization capabilities , and s tate-wide telehealth support to professionals as well as patie nts and their families in their communities . In addition, I wanted to thank Dr. Barbara Damron for her outstanding work in leading the Government Relations Office. As many of you may know, she has announced that she is stepping down from the Chief Govern ment Relations Officer position at UNM at the end of October . This is a great los s for UNM but we are thankful that she will return in her role at the College of Nursing. The search for a n HSC government relations officer continues and another search will begin for replacing Dr. Damron. I want to thank Gina Urias -Sandoval, my chief of staff, as well as others who are assisting us all during this interim as we continue to move legislative priorities forward with main campus and prepare for the 2022 legislati ve session. Veterans Affairs Health System Leadership Changes Our VA strategic advisory group has started and continues to meet monthly. Unfortunately for us, Director Welch recently retired; however, the new interim Director is making the transition smooth as there is a national search for the next Director. Interim Director Gurga and I are continuing the progress with the VA-UNM HSC partn ership to increase research, faculty opportunities, our commitment to veterans and our educational opportunities. College of Nursing Honors We continue to move forward with strengthening the ties between our colleges and our health system. I am proud t o announce the College of Nursing ranked 43rd out of nearly 700 collegiate university nursing programs, placing it in the top 6% of all bachelor of science in nursing programs in the nation, as reported by U.S. News & World Report's 2022 edition of Best Colleges . Summary Thank you all for your leadership and service. Thank you, Dr. Richards, for presenting this update. I look forw ard to our next meeting and am again sorry that I was unable to attend today.

Native American Liaison: Our Q2 CY2021 report on Inpatient and Outpatient volumes was sent to I.H.S. in June; referrals steadily increased over first quarter volumes, with 2,175 outpatient referrals and 1,338 inpatient admissions between April and June 2021. Average Daily Census r emains high, averaging 112 Native American patients in a bed per day during May - June 2021. For comparison, ADC was 103 beds during CY2020. This information is shared with I.H.S., the county, and the board subcommittee during regularly scheduled meetings. The Native American Services committee of the board met on August 31, 2021 to review the agenda and data points to be shared at the UNMH Annual Fall Meeting with NM Pueblos, Tribes and Nations, which was held on September 16, 2021. In addition to our an nual report, Dr. Jon Femling shared information about COVID -19 vaccinations and staying safe measures. UNMH sent out care packages to all Pueblos that included UNM Health items, our first -ever Native American Health Services newsletter, and brochures of UN MH services available. We'd also like thank and recognize two of the Pueblos who have provided letters of attestation for Pueblo members who are fluent in Pueblo languages. This allows UNMH the opportunity to provide medical interpreter training, so we can now provide in -person interpretation for Zuni and Keres. Bernalillo County: UNMH and Bernalillo County have continued to meet with architects related to the New Crisis Triage Center. In addition to the Crisis Triage Center UNMH has made the decision to rebuild and expand Psychiatric Emergency Services as part of this project. This will allow for a consolidated Crisis Services platform for behavioral health patients as well as streamlining how first responders access resources. The project will also in corporate a peer living room model that will provide an alternative for stabilized patients to access needed support services. UNMH also continues to proceed with the purchase of a community based building to allow for relocation of Behavioral Health Prog rams for Children and the Transfer Center to allow for construction of the Crisis Center. 44/53 Date: September 24 , 2021 From: Irene Agostini, MD UNMH Chief Medical Officer General Updates Laboratory Subcommittee Update In the last report, we explained the structure of the High Census Steering and Operations Committee s. One of the important areas of this structure is the Lab Subcommittee. The Lab Subcommittee meet s weekly. They have completed data analysis and stakeholder interviews both inside the lab as well as on key inpatient units. Next steps are to: Pilot a Point of Care Urine testing machine in the ED to open capacity in the main Lab for other testing needs . Evaluate the possibility of blood testing Point of Care options for the floors \u2014current Pilot underway in the ICUs. Explore feasibility of implementation for a Cerner -Tricore IT integration to allow for printing correct Lab barcodes on the units to send with RN -collect blood draws. This will reduce processing time in the Main Lab and re sult in faster turnaround times. Consider ways to reduction overall lab utilization, from Provider Orderset revisions to educational efforts around commonly over -utilized tests. CMO Information Technology Update Huron To date, we've completed EHR improvements in provider documentation, scheduling and orders for more than 24 clinics including Family Medicine and General Pediatrics. We are now in the process of optimizing Transplant, Vascular Surgery, Nephrology, Cardiology, Orthopedics and Digestive Diseases. Huge shout out to our Ambulatory colleagues and Medical Directors for all their work in designing these enhancements with us! Telehealth We completed the rigorous RFP process and contracted with Teladoc as our new telehealth technology platform ! Check out their website to learn more. We've also kicked off the IT implementation team, are in the process of building the project timeline and are making design decisions in collaboration with the Ce nter for Telehealth and the awesome Dr. Schevchuck (the Center's new Medical Director)! Pediatric Oncology This implementation will allow us to electronically order chemotherapy in our pediatric population with the goals of improving patient safety and fac ilitating care delivery. We have obtained sole -source procurement with Cerner and Board approval. This will be an 18 -month project starting later this year. Thanks in advance to our Pediatric Oncology specialists who will be working with us on this initi ative. Electronic Consent This project will give us the ability to electronically sign consents and other forms in the EMR. No more hunting for consents - yay! Demos have been completed with stakeholder groups and we are currently working on sole - source procurement. 45/53 Cloud -Based Front -End Dictation Application We are wrapping up the contracting process for a new front -end dictation program to replace the current (older) on -site Dragon application. In addition to current funct ions, this upgrade will give us more advanced functionality, more accurate dictations, as well as the ability to dictate using your mobile device from home. Kick-off scheduled for late Q4 of 2021. CMO Quality & Safety Update Coming Soon! Did You Make A \"Good Catch\" Today? The Quality Team is working on relaunching and rebranding the Patient Safety Intelligence System (PSI). This will help streamline forms, improve the categorization of events and improve feedback on events entered into the system. As part of this effort, the Good Cat ch program will provide an opportunity to recognize those who catch near misses, which are errors where harm did not reach the patient. Near misses are historically under -reported and examining these events provide an opportunity to identify gaps and/or fl aws in the system. It's also a great way to recognize our c olleagues who make a \"Good Catch\". We will be able to submit these via the PSI system starting in October. CMO Ambulatory Update Congratulations to the New Associate Ambulatory CMOs! Congratulations to Dr. Valerie Carrejo (left) , our new Associate Ambulatory CMO for Primary Care! Another congratulations to Dr. Suzzane Emil (right) , the new Associate Ambulatory CMO for Medical Specialties! In addition, we are currently interviewi ng candidates for the new Associate Ambulatory CMO for Surgical Specialties and will update you once the candidate has been selected. 46/53 UNMH BOT Committee Reports 47/53Separator Page PD 2 Finance BOT Presentation August 2021 48/53149/53UNM Hospital YTD Stats Variance to -6.6% 3,614 3,901 (287) HospitalsAction OI Benchmark Jun-21 7.21 7.25 6.61 979,965$ 8.52% $ (79,517)$ 41.23% (84,722)$ 44.84% Increase in Net Capital Reserve ($ in thousands) 181,109$ 344,283$ 48,758$ 97,901 $ Increase in Net Assets after Capital Reserve ($ in thousands) 6,109 $ 73,283 $ 48,758$ 34,901 $ Net Operating expenses exclude Contract Retail Pharmacy Expense *** Operating expenses exclude Contract Retail Pharmacy & HS Exec Initiatives* CMI Adjusted Patient Days (Adjusted Patient Days X CMI) is to account for the outpatient activities in the hospital and the relative acuity of the patients.
