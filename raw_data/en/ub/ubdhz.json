It has been 2 years, we are still nowhere close finding any solution. Vaccines have certainly helped. Omicron spread has just established the fact that vaccination is not an end to the spread of infection. However, vaccines should be credited for bringing down the casualties. The time has come we should all take responsibility for our own health. Invest in our health. By understanding - Why is it that some people get infected very fast and their immune system is not able to cope with the Covid-19 invasion? Many people have lost the battle against Covid-19. Some people get the infection, they get the symptoms, and their immune system helps them win the battle. They survive. Others get the infection, because of their good immune system, they do not get any symptoms and they remain healthy despite the infection. Then there are those who do not get an infection, as they have a robust immune system. Healthy Immune System does not develop overnight. Some people get a healthy gene pool. Largely it is our day-to-day habits, our lifestyle, and our intellectual, emotional, and spiritual quotient that helps us develop a robust immune system. The purpose of this page is to help you develop a good robust immune system by taking-up good habits by way of adopting simple rituals. These habits will not bring an overnight miracle in your life.
