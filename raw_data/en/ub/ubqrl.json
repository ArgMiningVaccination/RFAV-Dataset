The past year has seen a number of notable developments at the NICD, including ground-breaking research spanning from providing insight into new pathways for HIV vaccine development to the discovery of new pathogens affecting humans. Furthermore, the sustainability for national public-health surveillance was boosted by a three-year conditional grant from Government, to provide the NICD with transition funding for the GERMS-SA programme. This national laboratory-based and active surveillance programme for communicable diseases was previously grant- funded by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). This provided an opportunity for the re-engineering of the programme to address national health communicable disease priorities, in addition to the focus on HIV. Also, the GERMS-SA programme has set out to expand its surveillance footprint to primary healthcare centres, which will provide a more comprehensive platform for delineating the burden of communicable diseases in South Africa. This expansion will also provide the platform for earlier detection of potential public health threats, such as the surveillance for novel influenza virus strains and outbreaks of water-borne diseases. The success of public health surveillance in South Africa is currently being challenged by the scarcity of field epidemiologists with a focus on infectious diseases. This is being materially addressed by the NICD in partnership with the Global Diseases Detection Network of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA, in the Field and Epidemiology Laboratory Training Program (FELTP). Over the past three years, the FELTP programme has been re-engineered to increase its output of the number of epidemiologists graduating (12 in 2013), including targeted training of individuals who have at least a Masters levels qualification. These FELTP graduates are expected to be a critical component of the NICD, as it plans on decentralising the support it provides at a provincial level with regard to assisting in infectious disease outbreak responses and providing provincial departments of health with estimates of the burden of communicable disease in their settings. Furthermore, the NICD through the FELTP programme also provided basic Epidemiology skills to 56 Department of Health staff during 2013 and trained a further 46 staff members in health policy and decision making analysis. Ground breaking research involving new pathway for HIV vaccine development and discovery of new pathogens affecting humans Professor Shabir Madhi Executive Director NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 5Some of the key surveillance activities undertaken by the NICD during 2013/14 include collaboration with the National Department of Health (NDoH) and South African Society of Travel Medicine in establishing the South African Travel Health Network in 2013. This network will provide travel-related health guidelines, surveillance for imported priority diseases and mass gatherings support. The Centre for Tuberculosis completed recruitment into the National Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Survey for seven of nine provinces in South Africa with >100 000 patients recruited, the results of which will inform drug-resistant TB policies for the country. The Centre has also completed the first audit of the burden of microbiologically-confirmed TB for South Africa, which covered the period from 2006 to 2013. These data will be instrumental in understanding the interaction between improved HIV management and the burden of TB in South Africa, as well as identify specific hot-spots which need to be targeted for intervention to reduce the burden of TB in South Africa. In addition, the Centre for Respiratory and Meningeal Diseases conducts on-going surveillance on the impact of immunisation of children with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and rotavirus vaccine on childhood pneumonia and diarrhoea morbidity and mortality. The Centre for HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections (CHIVSTI) have during 2013 supported the NDoH through laboratory testing for the 33rd Annual Antenatal HIV-1 Prevalence and HIV Incidence survey and the 3rd South African Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) Effectiveness study. The latter study further confirmed the reduction of HIV transmission from HIV-infected mothers to their offspring at the 4-8 weeks time point. Centre staff also provided technical assistance for STI guideline revisions being undertaken by the NDoH's Essential Drugs Programme Primary Care Sub-Committee. The Centre also determined the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of the first two cases of extended-spectrum cephalosporin- resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Africa. Both strains belonged to a successful internationally men who have sex with men (MSM) -linked multidrug-resistant gonococcal clone, associated with cefixime treatment failure in Europe and North America, and have implications with regard to future guidelines for STI management. Although increasingly focused on tailoring the activities of the Institute to being public-health orientated, the NICD nevertheless continues in its pursuit of research excellence and a resource for training South Africans as 100 000 patients recruited by The Centre for Tuberculosis - the results will inform TB policies for South Africa. Did You Know? The CHIVSTI supported the Department of Health through laboratory testing for the 33rd Annual Antenatal HIV-1 Prevalence and HIV Incidence Survey NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 6well as scientists from other African countries. The ground-breaking science at the NICD was illustrated by research published in Nature Medicine during 2013, in which as part of an international research consortium involving the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), and researchers in the USA and NICD staff in the Centre for HIV and STI thus defined the developmental pathway by which broadly-neutralising antibodies are generated and acquire the requisite molecular characteristics for neutralisation. These data provide important insights relevant to HIV-1 vaccine development. Also, staff in the Centre for Opportunistic, Tropical and Hospital Infections, using specialised DNA analysis, detected a newly- described (and as-yet unnamed) opportunistic fungus in the genus Emmonsia that caused disease among HIV-infected patients. This study was done in collaboration with NHLS colleagues in Cape Town and was published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. A discovery by the Centre for Emerging and Zoonotic diseases was a rodent-borne Bartonella species not previously described in humans, which was found to be a cause of infective endocarditis. The productivity of NICD staff is indicated by the ongoing year-on-year increase in peer-reviewed publications over the past three years. On the global front, the NICD continues to support other African countries by being a WHO regional reference centre for diagnostics, training and quality assurance. The Centre for Vaccines and Immunisation is also involved as a WHO reference centre for providing testing and laboratory training for measles and poliomyelitis, which are being targeted for elimination before the end of this decade. Also, the NICD continues to house the only level-4 biosafety laboratory facility in Africa, placing it in a strategic position in dealing with established and emerging highly communicable infectious disease threats in South Africa and the SADC region. Despite the resource constraints and financially challenging situation under which the NICD operates, the talent of personnel at the NICD enables it to deliver on its mission of being an internationally-acclaimed Institute that monitors communicable diseases in South Africa to help policy development geared toward the protection of South Africans, as well as in the broader African region.

Dr Karen H. Keddy; Centre Head (Not Photographed) NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 8BACKGROUND Data from the South African Health Review 2012/13 has revealed that the under-five mortality rate has declined rapidly since 2009 and by 2011 it had exceeded the targets recommended for 2014. The decline could be attributed to the successful implementation of the PMTCT programme and the introduction of the pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines into the National Immunisation Programme. Currently, there have been few advances in South Africa towards achieving Millenium Development Goal 7, which addresses the issue of safe food and water. The Centre for Enteric Diseases (CED) of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) was established in 2012, through the amalgamation of the Enteric Diseases Reference Unit and the Viral Gastroenteritis Unit of the NICD. The Centre is responsible for developing strategies and providing information to combat diarrhoeal diseases in South Africa. The centre currently monitors trends in diarrhoeal pathogen incidence and identifies areas for the introduction of additional interventions. SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES The Centre focused much of the 2012/13 period on continuing to provide high quality surveillance data for bacteria and viruses associated with diarrhoeal diseases and on amalgamating the two laboratory units into one functional centre. In addition to the regular reports provided to the Department of Health, the Centre was actively engaged with the Department of Agriculture in reviewing research protocols for the Water Research Commission, as well as hosting both local and international training for food and waterborne diseases. The Centre participated in the investigation of outbreaks in the Northern Cape, Gauteng, Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The diarrhoeal pathogens implicated in these outbreaks RESEARCH PROJECTS Typhoid fever surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa: Burden of Disease Study (TSAP) Funding: International Vaccine Institute, Seoul, Korea. This is an international bacteraemia study, to identify which pathogens cause illness in ten sentinel sites in Africa in patients presenting with fever. Data from South Africa on typhoid fever and other febrile illnesses are scanty and driven by outbreak or case reports, with limited information on emerging resistance in the pathogen, or through laboratory-based surveillance systems. Edendale Hospital is the site selected for this study: patients presenting with invasive disease due to various pathogens, including Salmonella Typhi are identified and additional information on the patients' history, including antimicrobial exposure, HIV status and outcome data are recorded by a surveillance officer. A Health Care Utilisation Study (HCUS) was undertaken from October - December 2013, to better calculate the burden of disease. Dr Nicola A. Page Centre Head NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 9Group for Enteric Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Surveillance in South Africa (GERMS-SA) - Laboratory- based surveillance for enteric pathogens. The CED does laboratory-based surveillance and characterisation of bacterial enteric disease in and non-O1) isolates from all body sites, and diarrhoeagenic E. coli isolates from stool. Enhanced surveillance for Shigella and Salmonella enterica isolates from normally sterile body sites was completed in 2013. EDRU currently receives specimens from over 4000 human cases per annum, according to the definition above. In addition the Centre undertakes to serotype Salmonella, Shigella and diarrhoeagenic E. coli (DEC) isolates. Regular reports on the isolates received are extracted from the database for information sharing purposes. Molecular methods may be used to establish strain relatedness in outbreaks. PulseNet Africa Funding: Global Disease Detection, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA. PulseNet is an international molecular subtyping network for foodborne/waterborne disease surveillance, using standardised genotyping methods. Information sharing is real-time, which provides global early warning, detection and investigation of foodborne/waterborne disease outbreaks, emerging pathogens and acts of bioterrorism. Surveillance data clarifies the molecular epidemiology of enteric diseases in Africa and assists preventative strategies planning, such as vaccine development and implementation. The PulseNet Africa database has a collection of PFGE patterns for ~3000 enteric pathogen isolates, which includes Vibrio cholerae O1 and enterohaemorrhagic E.coli database mostly includes patterns from South African isolates; however, isolates from eight other African countries are also represented. Vibrio cholerae O1 isolates have been received from the AFRICHOL network. Validation of real-time PCR for detection of Campylobacter in stool specimens Real-time PCR was validated and implemented to detect for Campylobacte r in stool specimens from children <5 years of age with severe acute diarrhoea, as part of the Rotavirus Surveillance Program. Stool samples were processed to extract microbial DNA and RNA using the QIAGEN QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. An aliquot of the DNA/ RNA extraction was used in a multiplex real-time PCR assay, to target genes specific for Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli . Results from the analysis of stool samples have found Campylobacter PCR detection rates to be 13% and C. jejuni is the most commonly identified specimen. These data suggest that rates of Campylobacter infection are much higher than previously thought and that many cases of campylobacteriosis have previously been missed in this group of patients. Validation of multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeats variable-number tandem-repeats analysis is a technique used to obtain a molecular subtype (DNA fingerprint) for a strain of bacteria. This allows determination of the genetic similarity of strains of bacteria, which can assist with epidemiological investigations of diseases. We validated a 5 locus (SENTR7-SENTR5-SENTR6- SENTR4-SE3) MLVA protocol. The methodology includes a multiplex PCR to target 5 genes, followed by an analysis for the presence and size of PCR products, using an Applied Biosystems 3500 Genetic Analyzer and GeneMapper Software, followed by determination of the MLVA profile. Validation of the methodology was successful and has now been implemented to investigate isolates of Salmonella Enteritidis. Characterisation of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi in South Africa, 2003 to 2013 In South Africa, for the 2003 to 2013 period, the CED identified 45 isolates of Salmonella Paratyphi; these were further serotyped as follows: Salmonella analysis: patterns for Salmonella Paratyphi A isolates clustered together, with most isolates showing a single pattern; patterns for Salmonella Paratyphi B variant Java isolates also clustered together, but isolates showed a diversity of patterns; Salmonella Paratyphi B and Salmonella Paratyphi C isolates showed a diversity of unrelated patterns. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 10Azithromycin susceptibility in recent antimicrobial-resistant Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor isolates in South Africa The aim of this study was to investigate antimicrobial susceptibility (by E-test and agar dilution methods) to azithromycin, as well as to investigate the presence of seven macrolide resistance determinants amongst 100 South African selected antimicrobial-resistant Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor variant isolates. Irrespective of the test method used, all 100 isolates were susceptible to azithromycin and were PCR-negative for the seven macrolide resistance determinants. Statistical comparison of the results showed agreement of MIC values, based on the nearest similar dilution factor at 97% (p >0.05; Mann-Whitney) and MIC correlation at 99% (p <0.01; Spearman correlation coefficient). The agreement between the two azithromycin susceptibility testing methods and significant correlation of MICs, is evidence of the consistency of the test methods. Development and evaluation of a multiple-locus variable- number tandem-repeats analysis assay sub-Saharan Africa NICD Researchers/Investigators. Funding: This work was supported in part by a grant from Global Disease Detection, grant 1U19GH000571-02. The aim of our study was to develop and evaluate a relevant and highly reproducible multiple-locus variable-number markers to analyse representative Salmonella Typhi strains from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Fifty Salmonella Typhi strains from humans were selected from the culture collection at the CED and used to evaluate 13 polymorphic VNTR loci that were previously published. Of these, six VNTR loci showed good allele variation and were found to be suitable for use in MLVA analysis of Salmonella Typhi strains. This needs to be narrowed down to a 5-loci MLVA assay, which can be performed in a single multiplex PCR. The assay will then be used to analyse Salmonella Typhi strains from Sub-Saharan Africa.

The aim of the project was to develop real-time detection techniques to identify enteric viruses. Stools samples collected through the rotavirus sentinel surveillance programme between 2009 and 2012 were screened. Of the 4 021 stools screened, Additional typing was performed in 562 adenovirus -positive samples with species A (11.2%), B (19.4%), C (22.8%), D (9.4%), E (36.7%) detected. A multiplex real-time detection assay was developed and is being validated. Post-marketing intussusception monitoring after introduction of oral rotavirus vaccine in South Africa Funding source: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Intussusception is a rare intestinal blockage which was previously associated with vaccination of infants with a human-simian rotavirus reassortant vaccine formulation. Current rotavirus vaccines did not demonstrate an increased risk of intussusception during large scale vaccine trials. However, post-marketing studies have detected a low-level risk after vaccine administration. No risk data is available for African settings. Active surveillance for intussusception cases has been implemented in seven South African cities. A total of 23 stools were submitted to the laboratory for testing, with rotavirus, norovirus genogroup I and bocavirus detected in one sample each, astrovirus detected in three samples, norovirus genogroup II detected in four samples and adenovirus detected in seven samples. The study will continue for the next three years. TEACHING AND TRAINING In addition to postgraduate students enrolling for higher degrees through the Centre, the CED also undertook to train 11 epidemiologists and 10 laboratory personnel from other African countries, namely Zimbabwe, Botswana, South Africa, Namibia, Seychelles and Mozambique as part of the WHO's Global Food Borne Diseases Network (GFN) training. Material covered included investigation of foodborne/waterborne outbreaks, including epidemiological investigation and laboratory characterisation of isolates, water testing and quality management systems. In addition, the CED also ran a PulseNet training course in the genotyping techniques of number tandem-repeats analysis (MLVA) of bacteria. Participants included representatives from the 11 PulseNet Africa member countries, including South Africa, Kenya, The Gambia, Senegal, Cameroon, Malawi, Tanzania, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Uganda and Mozambique. The CED conducted registrar training by providing a long course in enteric pathogen detection, characterisation and laboratory surveillance from 13-24 May 2013 and an abbreviated short course in the basics of enteric pathogens on 24 July 2013.Zimbabwe Botswana South AfricaNamibia MozambiqueSeychellesCED trained 11 epidemiologists and 10 laboratory personnel from other African countries NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 12The CED provided course content for the training of scientists in the African Rotavirus Network Workshop on 22 July 2013.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 13CHAPTER 2 CENTRE FOR EMERGING AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES Professor Janusz T Paweska Centre HeadDigital illustration of rabies virus in colour background NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 14EMERGING AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES It has been estimated that up to 65% of emerging infectious diseases in the past 60 years have been attributed to zoonotic agents. It is reported that the major zoonotic disease outbreaks (including Rift Valley fever, Nipah and West Nile outbreaks) during 1997 to 2009, cost the global economy a staggering US $ 6.7 billion per year (World Bank, 2012). The Centre for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases (CEZD) aims to rapidly detect, identify and thus contribute to the control and prevention of infections, caused by high consequence viral and bacterial pathogens. Emergence or re-emergence of highly dangerous pathogens has special relevance to Africa, due to the extensive human-wildlife interaction, rapidly increasing land- usage and difficult socio-economic conditions. The public health burden of zoonotic agents in South Africa is still poorly understood. The CEZD renders not only diagnostic expertise, but also investigatory capacity on biohazard class three (BSL-3) and four (BSL-4) bacterial and viral pathogens associated with zoonotic diseases. The CEZD employs a \"One Health\" approach in its investigations, incorporating a better understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of these diseases as a whole. It is the mission of the CEZD to be a resource for knowledge and expertise to the South African government, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and elsewhere on the African continent. In this context, the CEZD assists in the planning of relevant policies and programmes and harnesses innovation in science and technology to support surveillance, detection and outbreak response. In observing these goals, the CEZD supports South Africa's commitment to the International Health Regulations. SURVEILLANCE AND DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES The laboratories of the CEZD provide capacity for the investigation of viral haemorrhagic fevers, arboviral diseases, human rabies and rabies-related infections of public health relevance in Africa. The Centre is accredited for a range of diagnostic tests with the South African National Accreditation System (SANAS). In addition, in 2012, the CEZD obtained approval from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) to perform several tests for the diagnosis of Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and rabies in animals. Scientists working in the biosafety level four laboratory at the CEZD, NICD. The CEZD provides capacity for investigation of viral haemorrhagic fevers, arboviral diseases, human rabies and rabies- related infections of public health relevance in Africa. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 15To provide the diagnosis and perform research on BSL3 and BSL4 viral and bacterial pathogens, the CEZD manages the operation of high and maximum biocontainment facilities. The Centre's BSL4 facility is the only Maximum Biocontainment Suit Laboratory on the African continent and provides an invaluable and strategic resources for the investigation, handling and storage of the most deadly pathogens known to science. In addition, the CEZD is tasked with the laboratory confirmation and investigation of anthrax, plague, leptospirosis, cat scratch disease ( Bartonella infection) and botulism. Work on these agents is carried out in a BSL3 facility accredited with the DAFF and the SANAS. The CEZD drives a regional surveillance project for plague (previously the RATZOOMAN project), and is recognised as the Anthrax and Plague Reference Laboratory for Human Diagnostics in South Africa. Recently, the CEZD has expanded the surveillance activities to include other zoonotic pathogens, such as the bacteria that cause brucellosis and Q fever. The transmission electron microscope is an important tool in the diagnostic arsenal of CEZD for detection of viral pathogens that are not detected by existing PCR protocols, as well as for detecting certain bacteria (particularly obligate intracellular bacteria) and identifying larger pathogens such as microsporidia. The Electron Microscopy capacity provides rapid viral diagnostic screening to both the CEZD and the Division of Public Health and Outbreak Response. For example, conventional resin-embedding and ultramicrotomy techniques were crucial in identifying the microsporidial genus occurring in two paediatric renal-transplant patients, and were also requested for ultrastructural confirmation of Tropheryma whippelii infection. Collaborative research support was supplied to the National Institute for Occupational Health for investigations of Acanthamoeba -pathogenic biofilms in the water supply systems of certain hospitals in Gauteng. CURRENT RESEARCH AND SURVEILLANCE A summary of selected projects currently underway at the CEZD: Surveillance for zoonotic pathogens in South African bats Bats are increasingly being implicated as hosts of dangerous zoonotic pathogens. Recent serological and molecular results suggest the presence of various known or potential zoonotic pathogens, including filoviruses, rabies-related viruses, paramyxoviruses, fruit and insectivorous bats in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Intensive monthly sampling at the affected bat roost was conducted in 2013 and will continue over the next few years to better understand the seasonality and ecology of these pathogens in bat populations. Collaborators: Prof Wanda Markotter, University of Pretoria Oral swab sampling of Rousettus aegyptiacus from the Mahune cave, Limpopo ProvinceUsing the transmission electron microscope of the CEZD, the NICD detects, identifies and produces imaging of various pathogens associated with zoonotic and other diseases of public health importance to South Africa Did You Know? Bats are increasingly being implicated as hosts of dangerous zoonotic pathogens NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 16Bartonella - an underdiagnosed, fleaborne disease The transmission of Bartonellae between the reservoir and mammal host is aided by haematophagous arthropods such as fleas, sand flies, mites, lice and ticks. Rodents have been regarded as common reservoirs for zoonoses like Bartonella . PCR revealed a 22.8 % (n = 35) Bartonella prevalence in the specimens specifically received for Bartonella testing, and a 9 % (n=75) Bartonella prevalence in the acutely ill patient specimens. What is of great concern however is the Bartonella nucleic acid, which was detected in 51 % (n = 105) of a sample of rodents collected in the City of Johannesburg. Experimental studies with filoviruses in Egyptian fruit bats The Egyptian fruit bat is postulated to be the reservoir species for Marburg virus, but transmission and shedding mechanisms are yet to be described. Preliminary results indicate that Marburg virus replicates efficiently in various tissues and causes relatively long-lived viraemia, but does not induce disease or overt pathology and is not efficiently transmitted from infected to non-infected bats, despite very close contact between them. Results from this study further contribute to establishing a bat-filovirus experimental model and contribute to a better understanding of the role of bats in the maintenance of filoviruses in nature. Collaborators: Prof Wanda Markotter, University of Pretoria Sero-surveys for human exposure to arthropod borne and zoonotic infections in the Kruger National Park The Kruger National Park has favourable climatic conditions for the breeding of many species of mosquitoes and ticks known to be vectors of pathogens of public health significance. Humans can also acquire infections from the animal hosts of these pathogens, and certain occupational activities increase a person's risk of becoming infected. The project concerns the seroprevalence of selected mosquito-borne, tick-borne and rodent-borne infections amongst the human population that work or reside in the Park. Serological results of surveys conducted in 2013 suggest a high prevalence of tick bite fever and q-fever bacterial infections, but a rather surprisingly low infection rate for arthropod-borne viral and rodent-borne bacterial pathogens.

The CEZD is also involved in the training of microbiology and clinical pathology registrars, intern scientists and technologists on an ongoing basis. The CEZD coordinates a number of formal training programmes and is often requested to coordinate specialist diagnostic workshops. This includes training environmental health officers from the City of Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, on the dissection and storage of rodent organs for plague surveillance purposes.

Optimal results were reported by 64% of the analyses, 21% achieved acceptable results and 15% of the results revealed that there is a need for improvement. The Special Viral Pathogens Laboratory (SVPL) of the CEZD validated panels before they were dispatched to participating laboratories. Optimal RVF molecular diagnostic results were achieved by the SVPL. Rift Valley fever in Tanzania: review of 80 years of data Sindato C, Karimuribo ED, Pfeiffer DU, Kivaria F, Dautu G, Mboera LEG, Paweska JT. Spatial and temporal pattern of Rift Valley fever outbreaks in Tanzania 1930 to 2007. PloS One 2014; 9(2):e88897. Synopsis: This study investigated the spatial and temporal pattern of RVF outbreaks in Tanzania over the past 80 years. A retrospective study was carried out, based on disease reporting data at district or village level. The space- time permutation model was applied to identify clusters of cases, and a multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors associated with the occurrence of outbreaks in the district. RVF outbreaks were found to be distributed heterogeneously and transmission dynamics appeared to vary between areas. The sequence of outbreak waves continuously cover more parts of the country. Whenever infection has been introduced into an area, it is likely to be involved in future outbreaks. The cases were more likely to be reported from the eastern Rift Valley than from the western Rift Valley ecosystem and from areas with clay and loam rather than sandy soil texture. Lujo virus hemorrhagic fever Paweska JT, . Edition, CRC Press, 2013: 287-305. Synopsis: The book is meeting the growing need for a single source of information, focusing on viral hemorrhagic fevers, by editing 30 chapters that represent a major contribution to the virological literature and that are written by many experts worldwide. Lujo virus, a novel and highly pathogenic arenavirus, was identified as the etiological agent of an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in a South African healthcare facility in 2008. This outbreak heralded the first recognition of this previously unknown arenavirus and was the first report of a highly pathogenic arenavirus from Southern Africa. The chapter summarises laboratory and diagnostic findings resulting from investigations during this outbreak.

Coronaviruses in South African Vector borne and Zoonotic Diseases 2013; 13(7): 516-9. Synopsis: The study focused on the testing of a small panel of specimens (n=113) from different species of bats from localities in the North West, Limpopo and Gauteng Provinces of South Africa. RT-PCR testing for a target located in the RNA-dependant RNA polymerase gene of coronaviruses was used to detect three novel viruses from this panel. The sequences produced from these samples clustered with known alphacoronaviruses following phylogenetic analysis. This report provides the first evidence for molecular evidence for the circulation of coronaviruses in selected South African bat species.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 21CENTRE FOR HIV AND STIs Professor David Lewis Centre Head NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 22INTRODUCTION The Centre for HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) aims to be a resource of knowledge and expertise in HIV and other regionally relevant STIs to the National South African Department of Health (NDoH), Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African continent. It aims to assist with the planning of policies and programmes related to the control and effective management of HIV/STIs. The Centre also aims to be a place of academic excellence in terms of both research and teaching/training. It has a strong track record in the research disciplines of HIV virology, HIV immunology, HIV/STI epidemiology, HIV/STI diagnostics and HIV-STI interactions, as well as in successful supervision of PhD and MSc students. The Centre's leadership team consists of Prof David Lewis (Centre Head, STI Section lead), Prof Lynn Morris (HIV Research Section lead), Prof Adrian Puren (HIV Sero-Molecular Diagnostics Section lead), Prof Caroline Tiemessen (Cell Biology Section lead) and Prof Anna-Lise Williamson (HPV Section lead). SURVEILLANCE/DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES HIV prevalence and incidence surveillance. During 2013/14, the Centre supported the NDoH's 33rd Annual Antenatal HIV-1 Prevalence and HIV Incidence survey and the 3rd South African Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) Effectiveness study. The latter has further confirmed the reduction of HIV transmission from HIV- infected mothers to their offspring at the 4-8 weeks' time point and will be completed in October 2014. The HIV incidence field was advanced by the introduction of a CDC-developed HIV incidence limiting antigen avidity assay (LAg AI). The advance was recognised in a joint WHO/UNAIDS statement, following a review of the evaluation data. In 2013, the Centre performed LAg AI incidence testing on dried blood spot samples (DBS) as part of a national HSRC-led Survey for HIV Prevalence and Incidence. Testing for viral load and antiretroviral drugs levels was included in the recent infection testing algorithm to minimise the false recent rate. Preliminary data from the HSRC study did not show a decline in trend in HIV-1 incidence overall, although there was a decline in younger age groups but higher incidence in the females >25 years of age, which was four times higher than that of males of a similar age group. The Centre continued its close collaboration with the Public Health England, to further develop HIV surveillance within South Africa. Several objectives were identified and activities undertaken, including the formation of a National HIV Steering Group, the production of a HIV surveillance report based on key quality indicators using the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NHLS) testing data stored in the NHLS Central Data Warehouse and, finally, the review of the different data sources available. Thesewould be combined to increase the power and accuracy of in-country HIV surveillance, such as the District Health Information System and specifically NDoH databases for treatment, and the vital registration data from Stats SA and modelled data such as Spectrum SA. Initial progress has been made and through the Steering Group, it is hoped to develop work plans to coordinate the sources/ models to better understand the epidemic in the year ahead. The Centre is a resource of knowledge and expertise in HIV and other regionally relevant STIs to the South African Department of Health and the African continent. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 23HIV drug resistance surveillance The Centre's HIV drug resistance laboratory is the designated centre for national surveillance activities and also serves as a World Health Organization regional HIV Drug Resistance Laboratory. Surveillance for transmitted HIV drug resistance (TDR) among individuals assumed to be recently infected was undertaken in 2013/14 using specimens collected as part of the annual antenatal survey conducted by the National Department of Health. A total of 347 HIV-1 positive specimens from primigravid women age <21 years attending public hospitals in five provinces (Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu Natal and the Western Cape) in October 2011, were selected for genotypic analysis. Data were analysed using all available specimens to categorise TDR as low (<5%), moderate (5-15%) or high (>15%). Although 12 samples showed evidence of TDR, the point estimates were <5% in all five provinces for both the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTIs) and non-nucleoside RTI (NNRTI) drug classes. The data confirm that transmission of resistant viruses, particularly those with NNRTI mutations, is occurring in a number of South African provinces. Plans are in place to sequence specimens collected from across the country from 2012 in order to provide national and provincial TDR prevalence estimates. STI clinical syndrome, aetiological and gonococcal antimicrobial resistance surveillance The Gauteng STI surveillance project, run by the Centre in collaboration with the Gauteng Department of Health, continued to collect STI syndrome data from public clinics throughout the review period. In 2013/14, in collaboration with the DoH, Alexandra Health Centre and NHLS laboratories, the Centre undertook aetiological surveillance of three major STI syndromes (male urethritis syndrome, MUS; vaginal discharge syndrome, VDS; genital ulceration syndrome, GUS), as well as surveillance of gonococcal antimicrobial resistance, in Johannesburg, Gauteng and completed testing and data analysis for surveys undertaken in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga and Kimberley, Northern Cape in 2012/13. In addition, a new protocol for national STI aetiological surveillance was revised and approved by the funder and collaborative partner (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC), as well as in- country. Training of primary healthcare nurses took place in each of South Africa's nine provinces in March 2014.The specimens will be collected and tested in 2014/15. HPV surveillance The CDC-supported national STI aetiological survey, mentioned above will also incorporate HPV surveillance through testing for and genotyping of HPV DNA detected in the endocervical specimens collected from 18-20 NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 24year-old females attending family planning clinics at primary healthcare clinics across South Africa. In addition, a protocol (currently under review) has been developed to support HPV surveillance, using cervical biopsy material with histologically-confirmed high-grade/cancerous cervical pathology among women attending colposcopy clinics in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Umtata. HIV-1 rapid testing quality assurance and post-marketing surveillance of HIV rapid test devices The NDoH re-launched its HIV Counselling and Testing (HCT) Campaign in December 2013. The Centre has revised and introduced a more rigorous HIV rapid test evaluation process, in line with recommendations from the WHO and the CDC. The PEPFAR-funded HIV rapid test quality assurance programme continued its training and M&E of an internal quality assurance control (IQC) programme. Approximately 450 healthcare workers were trained on the IQC programme, and a total of 181 sites visits were performed in 2013/14. Three HIV rapid test kits were awarded to the government tender and post-marketing surveillance of the lots/batches of devices, prior to the release in testing sites had been conducted by the Centre. HIV external quality assurance (EQA) schemes Centre staff coordinated the HIV EQA programme for NHLS-participating laboratories. Three NHLS HIV serology surveys were distributed in 2013. The NICD provided the technical support in terms of panel characterisation and selection. Four survey panels for HIV RNA, comprising of two NHLS-specific regulatory and two international panels, were completed and a final report was circulated in March 2014 prior to distribution to 18 participating laboratories. In addition, the Centre provided HIV EQA support to other SADC countries. Support for HIV vaccine trials The Centre continued to provide results from validated end-point humoral antibody and molecular HIV assays for the HIV Vaccine Trial Network (HVTN). Sequencing Core Facility The Centre currently houses a newly-established Sequencing Core Facility at the NICD, headed by Dr Arshad Ismail. The Core Facility will consolidate all sequencing instruments at the NICD and aims to provide researchers with accurate, cost-effective, high throughput sequencing data. This facility will house both Next-Generation Sequencing (Illumina-MiSeq's and 454 Roche GS junior) and Sanger (3500xl and 3500) platforms. At this early stage, a number of projects have already been completed for the various Centres, justifying the need for centralised capacity and expertise. Select current research projects Correlates of protective immunity to HIV-1: a focus on Natural killer (NK) cell responses studies of maternal-infant HIV-1 transmission identified NK cell responses to HIV-1 peptides in whole blood intracellular cytokine assays that were associated with protection from acquiring HIV-1 in the infants, and with lower viral loads and higher CD4 T cell counts in the mothers. Since this discovery, the centre has utilised similar assays for the study of NK cell responses in long term non-progressors (LTNPs; maintain CD4 counts > 500 cells/\u00b5l for >6 years) and elite controllers (ECs; undetectable viral loads < 50 RNA copies/ml). These responses were present in 90% of LTNPs/ECs and in only 10% of HIV-1 progressors. They specifically targeted HIV-1 Env and Vpu peptide pools, and upon further mapping it was evident that response to select Vpu peptides was associated with the elite controller phenotype. Ongoing immunology and host genetic studies will provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying host control of HIV-1 infection in individuals able to spontaneously suppress viral replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Viral escape from HIV-1 neutralising antibodies drives increased plasma neutralisation breadth through sequential recognition of multiple epitopes and immunotypes (2010-2013) Key collaborators: Prof SS Prof C Williamson (UCT) Funding: CAPRISA, CHAVI, DST, NIH, Wellcome Trust Understanding how broadly cross neutralising (BCN) antibodies develop is an important goal for HIV-1 vaccine development. The Centre previously identified participant CAP257, whose plasma neutralised 84% of global viruses. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 25The Centre showed that CAP257 breadth was due to the sequential appearance of three distinct BCN antibodies. The first wave targeted a V2 epitope, also recognised by earlier strain-specific antibodies. Strain-specificity was determined by a rare N167 polymorphism in V2, with escape to the more common D167 variant coinciding with breadth. Escape from V2 antibodies by deletion of the N160 glycan exposed the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) that became the target for a second wave of antibodies, with escape mutations in the CD4bs driving increased breadth. The third wave targeted an unknown quaternary epitope. This study showed that the human immune system can generate multiple BCN antibodies, in response to an evolving viral population that exposes new targets through escape from earlier antibodies. Developmental pathway for potent V1V2-directed HIV-neutralising antibodies (2011-2013) Key collaborators: Dr PD PRF, NRF Antibodies capable of neutralising HIV-1 often target variable regions 1 and 2 (V1V2) of the HIV-1 envelope, but the mechanism of their elicitation has been unclear. Here the researchers define the developmental pathway by which such antibodies are generated and acquire breadth. Twelve somatically related neutralising antibodies (CAP256-VRC26.01-12) were isolated from CAPRISA donor CAP256. Each antibody contained the protruding tyrosine-sulphated, anionic antigen-binding loop (complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3) characteristic of this category of antibodies. Their unmutated ancestor emerged between weeks 30-38 post-infection with a 35-residue CDR-H3, and neutralised the virus that superinfected this individual 15 weeks post-infection. Improved neutralisation breadth and potency occurred by week 59 with modest affinity maturation, and was preceded by extensive viral diversification. HIV-1 V1V2-directed neutralising antibodies can thus develop relatively rapidly through initial selection of B cells with a long CDR-H3, and limited subsequent somatic hypermutation. These data provide important insights relevant to HIV-1 vaccine development. Boosting antibody responses with gp140 protein two years after DNA/MVA priming: Results from the HVTN 073E Phase I vaccine trial conducted in South Africa and the USA (2008-2014) Key collaborators: Georgia Tomaras and Funding: NIAID, DAIDS, HVTN This study was designed to explore whether antibody responses to a DNA/poxvirus vaccine can be improved with the addition of an envelope protein vaccine. 27 HIV-1-uninfected adult participants, who two years prior had been vaccinated with SAAVI DNA-C2 vaccine and SAAVI MVA-C vaccine, were boosted twice, C oligomeric V2 loop-deleted DNA/MVA with a protein boost (T1/T2, n=16), DNA/MVA with a placebo boost (T1/C2, n=6), placebo with a protein boost (C1/T2, n=1), or double placebo (C1/C2, n=4). Serum samples from two weeks after the 1st and 2nd protein boosts (visits 19 and 22) and six months later (visit 24) were tested for neutralising antibodies. For all 3 Tier 1 viruses, the area under the magnitude-breadth curve was significantly higher in T1/T2 versus T1/C2 at visits 22 and 24 (p<0.0001 and p=0.0052). No responses were seen to Tier 2 viruses in the TZM-bl assay or in the C1/T2 and C1/C2 groups. Thus, a protein vaccine was essential for eliciting neutralising responses, and the priming effect of DNA/MVA appears to last for many years with the mobilisation of antigen-specific B cells within weeks of protein boosting. Surveillance of acquired HIV drug resistance in adult and paediatric patients in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (2013-2014) (CDC) Funders: CDC-NHLS Cooperative Agreement 5U2GPS001328-05 A pilot cross-sectional sentinel surveillance project was undertaken to classify the proportion of patients failing 1st-line ART and to describe the patterns of drug resistance mutations (DRMs). Three populations were surveyed using consecutive sampling in 15 clinics between August-November 2013: adults on ART for 12-15 months (Surv1) and for 24-36 months (Surv2), and paediatric patients on ART for 12-36 months (Surv3). Specimens with VL 1000 cpm were defined as virologic failure (VF) and genotyped for DRMs. Specimens were collected from 1,924 adults and 161 children. VF prevalence was 8.2% in 85%, 89% mutations were M184V/I, K65R, K103N/S, V106A/M/I and Y181C. Viral suppression rates in the adult population receiving ART were high; however, a third of paediatric participants were viraemic. Among both adult and paediatric failures, DRMs were high. This pilot study highlights the importance of ongoing HIVDR cross-sectional surveys, and the high rate of VF among paediatric populations. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 26The Orange Farm study part 2: a community study of male circumcision (2007-2014) Key collaborator: Prof B Auvert (INSERM, University of Versailles) Funding: ANRS This project, which commenced in the latter part of 2007, aims to assess the impact of voluntary, safe, medical male circumcision on STI infections in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Centre continues to provide the laboratory testing required for community-based cross-sectional surveys. Male circumcision part D started on 27 January 2014. The approximate sample six is 6 000 specimens,which will be collected from both male and female participants. HIV Serology, HIV Incidence and selected HSV-2 serological and HPV genotyping testing will be done samples. STIs in men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) (2011-2014) Key collaborator: Dr K Rebe for Men's Health, ANOVA Health Institute) Funding: USAID The Centre, in collaboration with the ANOVA Health Institute, previously determined the prevalence of gonococcal and chlamydial infections at urethral, rectal and pharyngeal sites in symptomatic and asymptomatic MSM attending the Ivan Toms Centre for Men's Health in Cape Town. During 2013/14, the DNA extracts were additionally tested for HPV infection and any HPV positive samples were genotyped. There was a high prevalence of HPV infection, particularly in ano-rectal specimens. Oral HPV infection in South African men and women recruited for a study on HIV discordant couples (2013-2014) Key collaborators : Dr T Meiring and Assoc Prof papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence from oral samples was investigated in 263 women and 261 men. Oral mucosal HPV prevalence was found to be 14% (73/524) when considering both women and men, when grouped according to gender, 13% (34/263) women and 15% (39/261) men were mucosal HPV positive. Oral cutaneous HPV type prevalence was found to be 17% (91/522), when grouped according to gender, while 18% (48/262) women and 16.5% (43/260) men were cutaneous HPV positive. Fourteen samples that were positive for mucosal HPV types and 14 samples that were positive for cutaneous HPV types, were sent for 454 next generation sequencing. A new HPV type was detected from this sequencing data, the new sequence was confirmed by the WHO Reference Laboratory. We reported the first internationally verified cases of cefixime resistant gonorrhoea in Africa. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 27Detection of cutaneous HPV types in penile samples from South African men (2013-2014) Key collaborators: Dr T Meiring and prevalence in penile samples was investigated in 139 men, with known mucosal HPV type's status that were previously detected by Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping assay. A total of 70.5% (98/139) were cutaneous HIV-positive men were more likely to be positive than HIV negative (87% 60/69, Those that were positive for mucosal HPV types were more likely to also be cutaneous HPV types (91% 64/70, 49% 34/69, P<0.0001). that in men, genital site cutaneous HPV types are commonly detected. Eighty samples that were positive for cutaneous HPV types were sent for 454 next generation sequencing, to get the HPV genotype detected in these samples and to establish if new types are present.

Association of the ANRS-12126 male circumcision project with HIV levels among men in a South African township: evaluation of effectiveness using cross-sectional surveys. PLOS Medicine 2013; 10(9): e1001509. Synopsis: Approximately 2 000 randomly selected men aged 15-49 years were asked about their sexual behaviour and their intention to become circumcised, if uncircumcised, in a baseline survey in 2007/08. A similar follow-up survey was conducted in 2010/11 in which more than 3 000 men were invited to take part. At baseline, 12% of the men surveyed had been circumcised, whereas in the follow-up survey, the overall prevalence of circumcision and the prevalence of circumcision among 15-29 year-olds were 53% and 58%, respectively. The overall HIV prevalence at follow-up was 12% and it was estimated that, without the voluntary medical male circumcisions (VMMCs) NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 29performed during the Bophelo Pele project and the preceding randomised control trial, the prevalence of HIV among men living in Orange Farm would have been 15% in 2011. The study reported a reduction in the rate of HIV incidence rate ranging from 57% to 61% among circumcised men in comparison with uncircumcised men. Importantly, there was no evidence of an association between circumcision status and risky sexual behaviour. Gentle N, Paximadis M, Puren A and Tiemessen CT. Genetic variability in markers of HLA-C expression shows similarities between two diverse South African populations. Plos One 2013; 8: e67780. Synopsis: This study within the HLA-C 3' untranslated region (UTR) of 265 Black and Caucasian South Africans by direct sequencing and identified haplotypes encompassing the 263 insertion-deletion (indel) polymorphism and another indel at position 230 in both populations. Concomitant evaluation of variability at the 235 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), identified in previous studies to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the 263 indel and which associated with lower viral setpoint, revealed this polymorphism to be an inappropriate marker for the 263 indel in our populations. These findings provide important insights into genetic variability within the regulatory regions of HLA-C that have potential implications for the understanding of the regulation of HLA-C expression and its impact on HIV-1 disease progression.

J Antimicrob Chemother 2013; 68: 1267-1270 Synopsis: The researchers determined the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of the first two cases of extended- spectrum cephalosporin (ESC) resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae in South Africa, which were in case associated, with a verified cefixime treatment failure. These isolates were cultured from urethral discharge specimens collected by private GPs from men-who-have-sex-with-men. Both strains were resistant to cefixime and possessed a number of identical mutations in key genes contributing to ESC resistance in N. gonorrhoeae. The two strains contained the type XXXIV penA mosaic allele and belonged gonococcal clone (MLST ST1901), associated with several cefixime treatment failures in Europe and North America.

Synopsis: This study determined cervical, penile and oral HPV types in 221 heterosexual couples, through the use of the Roche Linear Array HPV genotyping assay. Oral HPV prevalence was found to be 6.8% in women and 13.5% in men. The risk of oral infection with a specific HPV type in women was increased when the same type was detected in their genital tract, the genital tract of their male partner or the mouth of their male partner. In men, the risk of oral infection with a specific HPV type was increased when the same type was detected in the genital tract of their female partner or the mouth of their female partner, but not when the same type was present in their own genital tract. These findings suggest that in African settings, oral HPV infection is acquired from sexual partners, and that in women may also be the result of self-inoculation.

Virology May 2013; 87: 4882-4894. Synopsis: Broadly cross-neutralising (BCN) antibodies are likely to be critical for an effective HIV vaccine. However, the ontogeny of such antibodies and their relationship with autologous viral evolution is unclear. Here, the study characterised viral evolution in CAP256, a subtype C-infected individual who developed potent BCN antibodies targeting positions R166 and K169 in the V2 region. These data suggest rapid maturation, within 11 weeks, of CAP256 strain-specific antibodies to acquire breadth, with implications for the vaccine elicitation of BCN V2- dependent antibodies. Overall these studies demonstrate that ongoing viral escape is possible, even from BCN antibodies.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 33CENTRE FOR OPPORTUNISTIC, TROPICAL AND HOSPITAL INFECTIONS NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 34John Frean Centre HeadBACKGROUND The surveillance, reference and research thrusts of the Centre are embodied in its name; namely opportunistic infections, particularly those that are related to HIV/AIDS; tropical infections, especially malaria and its vectors; and nosocomial infections, concentrating on antimicrobial resistance, molecular epidemiology and outbreak investigations in the hospital setting. A Satellite Molecular Epidemiology Unit, based at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, focuses on nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance. SURVEILLANCE, DIAGNOSTIC AND REFERENCE SERVICES In the Antimicrobial Resistance Reference Laboratory (AMRRL), phenotypic and genotypic characterisation of mechanisms of bacterial resistance was especially focused on Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , but a reference service was offered for all multidrug-resistant organisms, such as the emerging carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Enhanced surveillance for S. aureus infections was extended to the Western Cape Province. Other specialised diagnostic services were offered by the Parasitology and Mycology Reference Laboratories in the fields of opportunistic or unusual parasitic and fungal infections. Molecular tests, particularly PCR and pathogen genomic sequencing, are increasingly being offered. Surveillance functions encompassed national and regional monitoring of cryptococcal meningitis, candidaemia, pneumocystosis, protozoal diarrhoea, and antibiotic-resistant hospital infections. The Centre provides an identification service for medically important arthropods for entomologists, medical practitioners and environmental health officers. 'Malaria vector mosquitoes were routinely identified, and insecticide resistance studies carried out, by the Vector Control Reference Laboratory for the Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal Province Malaria Control Programmes. Advice and expertise, both at the national and provincial levels, was provided to the Department of Health, with participation on the SA Malaria Elimination Committee. Quality assessment (QA) services provided by the Centre, contributed to assessing diagnostic laboratory proficiency in South Africa and other African countries in malaria, bacteriology, mycology, and tuberculosis. The Centre has played an active role in reporting on laboratory capacity in the WHO African region for the past 12 years, and has supported QA for laboratories for international malaria vaccine trials (GSK Biologicals) and Global Vaccine- Preventable Invasive Bacterial Diseases sentinel sites. The National Biological Sample Collection has resumed its main function and expanded, documented and maintained collections of organisms of national importance, as a resource for scientists and quality controls for routine laboratory tests. Surveillance functions encompassed national and regional monitoring of cryptococcal meningitis, candidaemia, pneumocystosis, protozoal diarrhoea, and antibiotic-resistant hospital infections NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 35John Frean Centre HeadThe Centre was also involved in outbreak investigations and responses during 2013-14. These included malaria in communities south of Johannesburg, affecting residents without recent travel history. Entomological investigations revealed no evidence of local breeding of vector anophelines and it was evident that these were odyssean malaria cases, i.e. acquired via infected mosquitoes imported from endemic areas in vehicles, containers or other means. Malaria transmission outside the endemic provinces is of obvious concern, especially if unusual vector breeding patterns are involved. These investigations provide additional support to the Department of Health's malaria elimination activities. An outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae at private healthcare facilities in Gauteng was investigated in AMRRL and reported to the Department of Health. The MRL contributed to the investigation of a suspected outbreak of neonatal candidaemia at a Gauteng hospital. CURRENT RESEARCH AND SURVEILLANCE Insecticide resistance in malaria vectors Collaborators: Ms N Coetzer (University of Pretoria) Anopheles arabiensis is a major malaria vector in much of sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa. Resistance to insecticides in populations of this species is widespread, necessitating ongoing research into the mechanisms conferring resistance. Recent investigations showed that An. arabiensis adults produced from nutrient-deprived larvae are smaller and less tolerant to DDT intoxication. Conversely, well-fed larvae develop comparatively quickly into large, more DDT-resistant adults. In general, larval nutrient deprivation in An. arabiensis has important implications for subsequent adults in terms of their size and relative insecticide susceptibility, which may in turn impact on their malaria vector capacity in areas where insecticide-based control measures are in place. It was also demonstrated that permethrin resistance in South African An. arabiensis is associated with increased transcription of multiple genes which do not also confer cross-resistance to DDT, unlike a Sudanese strain of An. arabiensis in which cross-resistance between pyrethroids and DDT is evident, and which shows strong similarities to the South African strain in terms of gene transcription. Malaria vector control and transmission dynamics Collaborators: Dr CL Lyons(University of Stellenbosch) and Dr SL Chown (Monash University,Australia) Understanding the biology of malaria vector mosquitoes is critical in terms of disease epidemiology and vector control. This is especially important in terms of how climate change is likely to affect malaria transmission. It was shown that three important African malaria vectors, An. funestus , An. arabiensis and An. gambiae , differ significantly in terms of their development rates and survival under different temperature treatments. Increasing temperatures associated with climate change favour survivorship in all three species, but fluctuations in temperatures are detrimental to An. funestus and may affect An. gambiae in a similar manner. This may have significant implications for disease burden in areas where one or more of these species are primary malaria vectors. Furthermore, in a study designed to compare receptiveness to infection with Plasmodium berghei between insecticide-resistant and susceptible laboratory strains of An. funestus, it was shown that pyrethroid-resistant females supported the lowest numbers of oocysts and sporozoites, while insecticide-susceptible females produced one of the highest sporozoite indices ever documented in P . berghei research. These data suggest that there may be association between insecticide resistance and refractoriness to Plasmodium infection, but further elucidation is required. Laboratory-based antimicrobial resistance surveillance for nosocomial bacteria (LARS) Laboratory surveillance for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) provides the platform for future coordination with the generation of reliable data on the occurrence of AMR in different geographical regions. A limited number of nosocomial bacterial pathogens such as pneumoniae (2010-2012), and P . aeruginosa (from 2014) were chosen to monitor trends in resistance at sentinel sites at the NHLS over the period. Enhanced surveillance for hospital versus community associated infections by methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus Collaborators: Dr R Kularatne and Dr T Nana(University of the Witwatersrand), Dr R Lekalala (University of Pretoria), Dr Colleen Bamford (University of Cape Town), Prof Andrew Whitelaw (University of Stellenbosch) Enhanced surveillance at five sentinel sites that participate in the LARS programme describes prevalence of methicillin-susceptible and resistant S. aureus , trends in frequency of resistance, and characterises mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. Genotypic methods are used to determine the prevalence and pattern of specific antimicrobial resistance genes. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis are used to distinguish hospital-acquired NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 36infections from community-associated infections. Most importantly, MIC50 and MIC90 on all antimicrobials tested, and epidemiological analysis, estimate burden of community- vs. hospital-associated MRSA. Additionally, clinical data risk factors associated with S. aureus infections will be analysed. Information will feed into a network of national and global data on the antimicrobial resistance of S. aureus. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), using an existing surveillance network in South Africa Early in the HIV epidemic in Africa, PCP was rarely diagnosed. More recent studies show that PCP is an increasingly important contributor to pneumonia in Africa. This is in contrast with industrialised nations, where the number of PCP cases has fallen since the early days of AIDS. Surveillance is being done for PCP in adults and children at sentinel sites in North West and KwaZulu- Natal provinces. The relative contribution of PCP to the burden of severe acute respiratory infections is being determined together with the Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis, NICD. Sentinel surveillance for parasitic causes of diarrhoea in hospitalised children Five sentinel sites provide stool samples from under-five children with diarrhoea, as part of a rotavirus surveillance programme; residual samples are screened for bacterial and parasitic pathogens. About 13% of samples contain pathogenic parasites; the vast majority (>95%) are Cryptosporidium species. Genotyping has previously shown that these are predominantly C. hominis. This human-specific species is therefore emerging as an important cause of childhood diarrhoea in South Africa. Analysis of the strain types of Toxoplasma gondii prevalent in humans and animals in South Africa The obligate intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a significant cause of congenital disease and an increasingly important AIDS- defining opportunistic pathogen. This project is investigating the genotypes and virulence markers of Toxoplasma prevalent in food animals, rodents, primary hosts (cats) and high-risk humans, and how they compare to strain types elsewhere in Africa and the world. Human cystic echinococcosis in South Africa Collaborators: Drs P Kern, K Wahlers (University Hospitals, Ulm, Germany), Dr T Romig (Hohenheim University, Germany), Prof M Grobusch (Amsterdam University Medical Centre and University of the Witwatersrand), Prof C Menezes and Prof M Wong (University of the Witwatersrand) Cystic echinococcosis (hydatid disease) Echinococcus granulosus . It affects various herbivore intermediate hosts (sheep, cattle, goats, camels etc), as well as humans that serve as accidental intermediate hosts. The disease is especially prevalent in pastoral communities, where there is close contact between humans, dogs and livestock. This study used molecular methods to investigate the genotypes and species of affecting humans in South Africa, and showed that most hydatid disease (74% of specimens tested) is caused by the G1 genotype, E. granulosus . Less common species/genotypes canadensis (G6/7)(19%) and E. ortleppi (G5) (7%). This is the first time that the genetic structure of the genus has been characterised in South Africa. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 37Public health programme: cryptococcal screening Programme partners: Department of Health, USAID, CDC, PEPFAR partners Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) has a fatal outcome in more than half of cases in routine care in South Africa. In 2012, 6 817 new cases of laboratory-confirmed CM were detected by the NICD; the incidence was 119 reported cases per 100 000 HIV-infected persons in South Africa. Detectable in blood for weeks to months before onset of CM, cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) is a strong predictor of the development of CM. Following the inclusion of a cryptococcal screen-and-treat intervention in the National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS, STIs and TB, South Africa is currently conducting a phased implementation of a national screen-and-treat programme. A reflex laboratory- based testing approach, paired with intensive monitoring and evaluation (M&E), has been used at 100 facilities in Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni Metro districts in Gauteng Province, with planned expansion of this approach to facilities in two rural Free State districts. From September 2012 through December 2013, 10,601 persons were screened for cryptococcal antigenaemia ; 473 (5%) tested CrAg+. Multilocus sequence typing of serially-collected isolates of Cryptococcus from HIV-infected patients in South Africa Collaborators: Prof TG Mitchell, Dr AP Litvintseva (Duke University, North Carolina, USA) Patients with cryptococcal meningitis in Sub-Saharan Africa frequently relapse following treatment. The natural history and aetiology of these recurrent episodes warrant investigation. We used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to compare the molecular genotypes of strains of Cryptococcus isolated from serial episodes of cryptococcal meningitis that were separated by at least 110 days. The most common MLST genotypes among the isolates were the dominant global clinical genotypes of molecular type VNI (M5 and M4), as well as the subpopulation of VNI genotypes apparently restricted to southern Africa. In addition, there was considerable genetic diversity among these South African isolates, as 15% of the patients had unique genotypes of Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii . Eleven per cent of the patients were re-infected with a genetically different strain of following their initial diagnosis and treatment. However, most serial episodes (89%), were caused by strains with the same genotype as the original strain. These results indicate that serial episodes of cryptococcosis in South Africa are frequently associated with persistence or relapse of the original infection. Emmonsia: A newly-discovered fungus causes a potentially deadly disease among HIV- infected South Africans Collaborators: Prof C Kenyon (University of Cape Town) Using specialised DNA analysis, the study detected a newly-described (and as-yet unnamed) opportunistic fungus in the genus Emmonsia that caused disease among HIV-infected patients. This fungus was genetically related to but entirely separate from known, similar fungi. In 2013, the researchers published information about thirteen cases of disseminated fungal disease that occurred among HIV-infected patients. All thirteen patients had advanced HIV disease, and most were thought to have TB. Some had skin changes suggesting a widespread fungal infection. Once the diagnosis had been made, most patients experienced dramatic and rapid responses to antifungal treatment. In most patients, the skin lesions healed almost completely, they gained weight and their lungs recovered. The infection was fatal in three patients. The infection was probably acquired after inhalation of fungal spores from the environment. No person-to-person transmission occurred with this infection. Since the last publication, at least 30 more cases have been identified through passive surveillance; two patients were HIV-uninfected. Current work on this fungal pathogen is focused on development of an accurate diagnostic assay (antigen and/or molecular assays), whole genome sequencing and exploration of its ecological niche. Clinical epidemiology of candidaemia at sentinel hospitals Patients with candidaemia were identified through active laboratory-based surveillance at nine sentinel hospitals in Gauteng and Western Cape provinces in 2012-2013. An incident case of candidaemia was defined as the isolation of Candida species from the first submitted blood culture. Detailed clinical information was collected, including underlying diseases and in-hospital mortality. Identification of isolates and antifungal susceptibility testing was performed at the Centre. For cases identified in 2012, a multivariable logistic regression analysis, stratified by age (neonates ( 30 days), children (>30 days and <15 years) and adults (15 years), was performed to determine factors associated with mortality. Just under half of patients with culture-confirmed candidaemia died in hospital. Predictors of mortality differed by age group and receipt of antifungal treatment was shown to be protective among neonates and adults. Did You Know? We detected a newly- described opportunistic fungus in the genus Emmonsia that caused disease among HIV- infected patients. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 38Molecular typing of Candida isolates causing hospital-associated bloodstream infections Selected isolates of Candida spp. submitted through laboratory-based surveillance for candidaemia have been selected for molecular typing. Selected Canada parapsilosis isolates have been typed to determine the prevalence of cryptic species. In addition, the Centre has set up PCR assays for amplification of HS1 and HS2 regions of the fks1/ fks2 genes to identify the mutations associated with elevated echinocandin levels in Candida species. Lastly, the Centre has set up assays for microsatellite typing of C. parapsilosis to establish strain relatedness and to uncover previously-undetected nosocomial outbreaks. Analyses of these data are ongoing.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 41CENTRE FOR RESPIRATORY DISEASES AND MENINGITIS Shutterstock: Meningococcus NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 42BACKGROUND The year under review continued to see the Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis (CRDM) perform its core functions of syndromic surveillance for pneumonia at sentinel sites within South Africa and laboratory- based surveillance for important bacterial causes of invasive disease and meningitis throughout the country through the GERMS-SA platform. Using these surveillance programmes, the Centre identified key seasonal and epidemiological variations of viral and bacterial pathogens. These data are essential to implement and monitor the impact of ongoing interventions and plan for future interventions to reduce the burden of severe disease and death due to pneumonia and meningitis. The CRDM is expanding its capacity to use new diagnostic technologies such as Taqman array card (TAC, Life Technologies) or Fast-Track Diagnostics (FTD, Junglinster, Luxembourg), that may assist in future surveillance, outbreak investigation or individual patient diagnostics. In addition, the Centre is moving into the era of whole genome sequencing for almost all of its pathogens, hosting the first annual Investigator's Meeting for the Global Pneumococcal Sequencing Project (GPS). It also underwent a formal assessment in 2013 of the capacity and quality management of the laboratory with regard to it's ability to provide polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of samples as the WHO/AFRO (World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa) Regional Reference Laboratory for vaccine-preventable invasive bacterial diseases (VP-IBD) for the southern and eastern Africa region. The Centre has been commended for the excellent standard of work and quality measures currently in place. The CRDM continues to function as a WHO National Influenza Centre (NIC) and with a newly established biosafety level three laboratory the CRDM/NIC will continue and expand work to support the diagnosis of known and emerging causes of respiratory diseases and meningitis within South Africa and the region. CURRENT SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMMES Pneumonia surveillance The Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) programme, which initially aimed to describe the contribution of influenza, other respiratory viruses and pneumococcus to the syndrome of SARI, has been expanded to include patients with more chronic respiratory illness and include the collection and testing of specimens for atypical bacterial causes of pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Bordetella pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae ) at selected sites. Surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) is ongoing in outpatient clinics. As part of this programme, asymptomatic patients are also enrolled, in order to describe the association between organisms identified and disease. Ongoing influenza surveillance and outbreaks preparedness In 2013, the majority of influenza A isolates were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (41/46) and 50% (18/36) to the A/California/7/2009 reference. Three A(H3N2) isolates reacted with 2 fold lower titres to the reference antiserum, A/ Perth/16/2009. Influenza B virus isolates showed Wisconsin/1/2010 (Yamagata lineage) antisera. H3N2 haemagglutinin (HA) genes from 2013 are in genetic group 3 and specifically 3C. For 70 A(H1N1)From left: Dr Cheryl Cohen Dr Anne von Gottberg Prof Marietjie Venter (resigned) Centre Heads The Centre identif ied key seasonal and ep idemiological variations of viral and bacterial pathogens NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 43pdm09 positive samples sequenced 99% (69/70) are in lineage 6. Seven influenza B strains belong to clade two of the B/Yamagata lineage. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positive samples (n=203) tested for the H275Y oseltamivir resistance mutation were wild type. For influenza virus isolates [A(H1N1)pdm09: n=16, A(H3N2): n=1, influenza oseltamivir and zanamivir, 1 A(H1N1)pdm09 was resistant and 1 showed reduced sensitivity. Assays to test for the MERS-coronavirus by real time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) of the E and orf-1b genes were established. The assay for the E protein gene target (UpE) is considered highly sensitive, and has been implemented at the CRDM. A second confirmatory PCR on the open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) and a pan-coronavirus PCR can run on UpE positive specimens. For A(H7N9) preparedness,the CRDM established the real time RT-PCR assays to test for the H7 and N9 genes as well as other avian H9 influenza have been established for serological surveillance for human exposure to the following avian influenza virus strains: for avian influenza A strains enhance our capacity to provide reference laboratory support for avian influenza virus diagnosis and enable the Centre to detect cases of the emerging H7N9 strain from China. Specific/selected projects Circulating seasonal and pandemic influenza A and influenza B virus genotypes from 2009-2012: Vaccine strain match and break-through infections in South Africa NICD investigators : F Treurnicht, J Manamela, D Naidoo, J McAnerney, C Cohen, M Venter Vaccination against seasonal influenza viruses is important to reduce morbidity and mortality annually in the most vulnerable of the population. The HA1 region of the influenza hemagglutinnin gene was amplified by strain- specific nested RT-PCR followed by direct sequencing of amplicons. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis was performed using BioEdit version 7.1.7 and MEGA 5 programmes. The ATIVS tool was used to predict antigenic distances between A(H3N2)vaccine and seasonal strains where antigenic distances 3.25 predict low antigenic reactivity to vaccine strain-derived antisera. The mechanism for vaccine escape needs to be explored further in cases where the antigenic distance between the vaccine and seasonal viruses is <3%. The emergence of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 strain in 2009 demonstrates vaccine escape as a result of antigenic shift. Antigenic drift over time led to vaccine escape for influenza A(H3N2) strains in 2009, which conincided with introduction of a vaccine strain matched to circulating strains. Vaccine strain mismatch is also predicted for influenza A(H3N2) lineage 7 and 3 A viruses when compared to the 2012 and 2013 Southern Hemisphere vaccines. Healthcare utilisation surveys in Soweto and Klerksdorp NICD investigators: C Cohen, C von Mollendorf, S K Wong, AL Cohen, S Tempia; PHRU: N Martinson; University of Witwatersrand: S Norris, E Variava This project aimed to describe healthcare-seeking behaviours for common infectious syndromes and to identify reasons underlying decisions to seek care. There were 1 442 households in Klerksdorp and 973 households in Soweto interviewed between August and September 2012. Public clinics were most frequently consulted for illnesses (Klerksdorp: 43%; Soweto: 42%), although private-sector facilities also comprised a substantial proportion of consultations. Common barriers to accessing healthcare included perceived deficiencies in medical resources and limited personal resources. In Klerksdorp, seeking care with hospitals, clinics, or doctors was associated with being HIV-infected (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.1-7.2); in (OR: 2.0; 95% 1.4-4.4). NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 44Epidemiology of influenza types and subtypes among patients hospitalised with pneumonia in South Africa, 2009-2012 NICD investigators: C Cohen, M Venter, SARI surveillance group; CDC: AL Cohen, S Tempia This analysis compared clinical and epidemiologic characteristics associated with infections due to influenza types and subtypes among children and adults hospitalised with influenza-confirmed severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). Respiratory specimens were tested, typed, and subtyped for influenza virus by polymerase chain reaction assay. 1,239 (8%) of 16,005 SARI patients tested positive for influenza. Case-patients with influenza B were more likely to be HIV-infected (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.4, 95% CI 1.02-1.8) than patients with influenza A. A higher proportion of case-patients infected during the first A(H1N1)pdm09 wave were 5-24 years of age (19%) compared with the second wave (9%). There was no difference in case-fatality or severity between infections with different types and subtypes nor the first and second A(H1N1)pdm09 wave. Effectiveness and knowledge, attitudes and practises of seasonal influenza vaccine in primary health care settings in South Africa, 2010-2013 NICD investigators: JM McAnerney, S Walaza, A Buys, M Venter, L Blumberg, C Cohen Collaborators: A L. Cohen, J Duque (United states CDC) The effectiveness of the influenza vaccine was estimated using a test-negative case-control design amongst individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI) from 2010-2013. Mean annual influenza vaccine coverage among controls was 5% for the four years. Annual VE estimates adjusted for age, underlying medical conditions and seasonality for 2010-2013 The vaccine was significantly protective in 2010, 2011 and 2013, but not in 2012 when the circulating A(H3N2) strain showed genetic drift. A knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) influenza vaccine survey of programme clinicians was conducted in 2013 which showed that >90% of clinicians were familiar with the indications for and the benefits of influenza vaccination. Vaccine coverage was low despite good clinician knowledge of vaccination indications. Excess mortality associated with influenza among tuberculosis deaths in South Africa, 1999-2009 NICD investigators: S Moyes, C Cohen Collaborators: S Tempia, AL Cohen The excess mortality attributable to influenza was modeled by applying Poisson regression models to monthly pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) and respiratory non-TB deaths, using national influenza laboratory surveillance data as a covariate. Among individuals of any age the estimated mean annual influenza- associated mortality rates per 100,000 person-years were 164 (n=437) among those with PTB; among those without TB, the rate was 27 (n=1125) for HIV-infected and 5 (n=2367) for HIV-uninfected. No influenza-associated mortality was found among EPTB deaths. Among individuals <65 years of age, those with PTB experienced a greater risk of influenza-associated mortality as compared to HIV-infected individuals with respiratory non-TB disease (relative risk (RR) 5.2; 95% CI: 61.0; CI: 41.4-91.0). Similarly, among individuals 65 years of age there was increased influenza-associated mortality in individuals with PTB as compared to HIV-uninfected individuals with respiratory non-TB (RR 13.0; 95% CI: 12.0-14.0). In the 65 year age group where the HIV burden is lowest, no influenza-associated mortality was found among HIV-infected respiratory non-TB. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 45The detection of Bordetella pertussis in individuals presenting with severe respiratory illness and influenza-like illness in South Africa, May 2012 to April 2013 NICD investigators: F Moosa, M du Plessis, N Wolter, C Cohen, S Walaza, A von Gottberg Collaborators: SARI surveillance group This study determined the prevalence of Bordetella pertussis in patients with severe respiratory illness (SRI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) at Edendale and Klerksdorp-Tshepong complexes. Real-time PCR (targeting IS481 and ptxS1) was conducted on induced sputa from SRI patients and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs from all patients. The prevalence of pertussis was 0.5% (8/1597), 0.3% (3/1086) and 0.2% (1/452) in SRI, ILI and asymptomatic individuals, respectively. Positive cases were identified in <2 years (0.8%, 1/129) and 15-45 years (3%, 2/58) for ILI patients. Detection rates in induced sputa and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs collected from SRI patients were 0.3% (5/1525) and 0.7% (5/685), respectively; with two patients positive for both specimen types. There was no difference in the pertussis positivity rate for SRI cases detected in HIV-positive and -negative patients (4/792, detection Mycoplasma pneumoniae among patients with severe respiratory and influenza- like illness in South Africa, May 2012 - August 2013 NICD investigators: M Carrim, N Wolter, M du Plessis, L de Gouveia, S Walaza, F Moosa, C Cohen and A von Gottberg Collaborators: SARI surveillance group This study describes the prevalence of M. pneumoniae , using real-time PCR, in patients with severe respiratory illness (SRI), influenza-like illness (ILI) and asymptomatic individuals. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens were collected from all patients; induced sputum was collected from SRI patients. Macrolide susceptibility testing using high-resolution melt curve analysis (HRM), and MLVA analysis was performed on 30/43 M. pneumoniae -positive nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens. The (46/2280), and 0.2% (1/525) for SRI, ILI and asymptomatic individuals, respectively. Among the 46 M. pneumoniae- positive SRI cases, 24, 16 and 6 were from nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens, induced sputum and both specimen types, respectively. M. pneumoniae was detected in all age groups with 61% (28/46) occurring in children <5 years. Of those tested, MLVA identified three distinct types, and macrolide resistance was not detected. Bacterial aetiology of severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in South Africa, 2012-2013 NICD investigators: N. Wolter, M. Plessis, Venter, M. Carrim, F. Moosa, A. von Gottberg Collaborators: H. Dawood, E. Variava The bacterial aetiology of severe LTRI was determined in patients enrolled at two sentinel sites, using real-time PCR. Whole blood, induced sputum and and 739 (32%) were <5 years old. For cases with status, 57% (1067/1861) were HIV-positive. 137/1704 (8%) bloods were positive for S. pneumoniae with the highest detection rate in the 5-14 year age group (15%; 9/62). 1% (19/1720) of 11% (2/19) serotype b. detected (13/708) of induced sputa, with 10 cases (77%) occurring in the 15-45 year age group. M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were detected in 1% (17/1505) and 0.3% (5/1505) of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens, respectively. Although S. pneumoniae is the most commonly detected bacterial cause of severe LRTI, other bacterial pathogens should be considered in the differential diagnosis. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 46High nasopharyngeal pneumococcal density, increased by viral co-infection, is associated with invasive pneumococcal pneumonia in South Africa NICD investigators: N Wolter, C Cohen, SA von Gottberg Collaborators: S H Dawood, K Variava, KP Klugman Factors associated with pneumococcal colonisation (NPC), high colonisation density and invasive pneumococcal pneumonia (IPP) were determined among patients hospitalised with acute lower respiratory-tract infection (ALRI). In 2010, 4025 cases were enrolled in ALRI surveillance. 969 (24%) had nasopharyngeal specimens tested for respiratory viruses and S. pneumoniae by real-time PCR. Of these, 749 (77%) had blood tested for S. pneumoniae. NPC was detected in 55% (534/969). On multivariable analysis, controlling for age and tuberculosis treatment, influenza infection, adenovirus, rhinovirus and HIV were associated with NPC. High NPC density was associated with respiratory virus co-infection and IPP , controlling for age and gender. 7% (52/749) of cases had pneumococci detected in blood. On multivariable analysis, among NPC cases, IPP was associated with HIV, influenza, high NPC density and 5 days hospitalisation. Respiratory virus infection was associated with elevated colonisation density and, in turn, IPP . Real-time lytA PCR cycle threshold values pneumococcal serotypes A S Tempia, attach\u00e9 to NICD-NHLS Serotyping is key for pneumococcal disease surveillance. The study assessed the lytA cycle threshold values (CtV) that could predict real-time PCR-based serotype deduction (targeting 42 serotypes/groups). LytA PCR was conducted on blood collected from patients hospitalised for severe acute respiratory illness. Positive samples (CtV 40) were PCR serotyped. The proportion of \"PCR-serotypable\" samples with CtV30 was compared to the proportion of serotypable samples with individual CtV from 31 to 40 using multinomial regression. Of 14,311 samples tested, 953 (7%) were lytA positive of which 820 (86%) were available for PCR serotyping, and 398 (49%) tested positive for serotype/serogroup . For serotyped samples CtV ranged from 25-40 (median CtV 36). A progressive reduction in the proportion of PCR-serotypable samples was observed for CtV34: 61% (37/61; CtV 34) to 9% (4/45; CtV 39). Compared to samples with CtV30, the decrease in PCR-serotypable specimens was statistically significant for samples with individual CtV35. Low pneumococcal load ( lytA CtV 35) predicts a sensitivity of real-time PCR-based serotype deduction.Shutterstock: Legionella Pneumophila Bacteria NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 47LABORATORY-BASED SURVEILLANCE FOR BACTERIAL CAUSES OF MENINGITIS AND PNEUMONIA The CRDM continues to contribute to the evaluation of the impact of both the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) and the Haemophilus (Hib through national, laboratory-based, population-based, active surveillance for invasive pneumococcal and Hib disease and case-control and other epidemiologic studies. The CDRM also contributes data on numbers and serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis and supports diagnostic testing and outbreak response for suspected cases of meningococcal meningitis. During 2013, the CRDM developed more specific plans to integrate surveillance with the Group for Enteric, Respiratory and Meningeal disease Surveillance in South Africa, (GERMS-SA) programme, specifically syndromic surveillance for pneumonia. Update on ongoing monitoring of the impact of the polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine (PCV) on invasive pneumococcal disease in South Africa NICD investigators: A von Gottberg, L de Gouveia, V Quan, S Meiring, C von Mollendorf, SA Madhi, Cohen and The Group for Enteric, Respiratory and Meningeal Disease Surveillance in South Africa (GERMS-SA) investigators South Africa introduced the seven-valent pneumococcal protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) in 2009. PCV-7 impact was assessed using active, national disease surveillance data for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (n=35,192 cases). From 2005-2012, the percentage change in IPD incidence, focusing on individuals aged <2 and 25-44 years, between post-vaccine (2011-2012) and pre-vaccine years (average of 2005-2008) was calculated. Rates of PCV-7 IPD among children <2 years declined by 89% in 2012, from 32.1 to 3.4 cases per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], -92% to -86%). Among adults aged 25 to 44 years, vaccine serotype IPD declined by 57% (95% CI, -63% to-50% [3.7/100,000 to 1.6/100,000]). The large reduction in disease caused by vaccine serotypes among both children and adults likely reflects substantial direct and indirect benefits from PCV-7 introduction. The smaller reduction in nonvaccine-serotype IPD suggests HIV prevention efforts are also playing a role in prevention of serious pneumococcal disease. Epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in HIV exposed-uninfected children <1 year of age in South Africa, 2009 to 2013 NICD collaborators: C von Mollendorf , , KP , C Whitney A cohort study in children (<1 year) was conducted using pneumococcal surveillance data from the GERMS-SA programme for 2009 through 2013. There were 2 099 IPD cases in children <1 year of age from 2009 through 2013. Across all five years, the highest incidence of IPD was in HIV-infected children (323/100,000-473/100,000 population) compared with HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) children (17/100,000-23/100,000; relative risk 14.3 [95% CI 10.3-19.8]) and HIV-exposed uninfected children (42/100,000-60/100,000; relative risk 7.9 [95% CI 5.5-11.3]). HEU children also had a higher incidence of IPD than HUU children (relative risk 1.8 [95% CI 1.4-2.4]). In children <6 months of age, HUU children were at significantly lower risk of dying then HEU children (ARRR=0.54 [95% CI 0.33-0.90]). Whole genome resolution 2003-2012 Plessis, S Govindpershad, C Cohen Gouveia, N and A von Gottberg Jolley, ST-11 clone caused W (MenW) to increase in South Africa, replacing serogroup A as the predominant serogroup. Selected MenW isolates, collected through national surveillance, were analysed at the genome level. One MenW isolate per year (N=10) was randomly chosen for analysis. The BIGS database was used to analyse ST-11 isolates MLST, wgMLST). South African ST-11 isolates were compared to endemic and outbreak ST-11 genomes from the UK. 8/10 SA MenW isolates were ST-11, had identical finetyping antigens, and were closely related using genome analysis. Using rMLST, ST-11 isolates responsible for the Southampton outbreak were distinct. SA isolates clustered more closely with the endemic UK isolates. wgMLST analysis further resolved the UK endemic and SA strains into two groups.

Vaccine 2013; 31:4200-4208. In 2008, reported incidence of IPD was 6-fold higher in children <1 compared to children 1-4 years of age: 87 per 100,000 population and 14/100,000, respectively. The relative risk of IPD was 21-fold (95% CI, 19-24) and 34-fold (29-41) HIV-infected to HIV-uninfected children in the <1 year and 1-4-year-old age groups respectively. On multivariable analysis serotypes 6B (relative 0.2; CI 0.1-0.4) were significantly less common in HIV-infected individuals than serotype 14. All vaccine formulations have the potential to prevent most cases and deaths from IPD in children in South Africa. Vaccines with protection against 19A would be advantageous in South Africa.

Severe Influenza- associated Respiratory Infection in High HIV Prevalence Setting, South Africa, 2009-2011. Emerg Infect Dis. 2013 Nov; 19(11):1766-74. This paper describes severe influenza in HIV-infected individuals. Influenza-associated acute lower respiratory tract infection incidence was 4-8 times greater for HIV-infected (186-228/100,000) than for HIV-uninfected persons (26-54/100,000). HIV-infected patients were more likely to have pneumococcal co-infection; to be infected with influenza type B compared with type A; to be hospitalized for 2-7 days or >7 days; and to die from their illness. These findings indicate that HIV-infected persons are at greater risk for severe illnesses related to influenza and thus should be prioritized for influenza vaccination.

This paper describes the increase risk of hospitalisation with RSV-associated acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) in HIV infected children, after adjusting for age, HIV-infected children had 3 to 5-fold increased risk of hospitalization with RSV-associated ALRTI (2010, relative risk [RR] 5.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.5-6.4, 2011, RR 3.1 95% CI 2.6 -3.6). In addition HIV infected children admitted with RSV-associated ALRTI had more severe illness, with a higher odds of death (odds ratio [OR] 31.1, 95% CI 5.4-179.8) and hospitalization for >5 days (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.5-10.6) than HIV-uninfected children.

Serum neutralising antibodies in vaccinated mice were detected but low three weeks after primovaccination. Three weeks post-challenge, vaccinated mice had significantly higher serum neutralising antibody titres against both lineages than unvaccinated controls. After challenge, all vaccinated mice remained healthy but all unvaccinated mice demonstrated severe neurological signs with 75% mortality rate. WNV was not detected in brains of vaccinated mice whereas virus replicated in most unvaccinated mice challenged with either lineage. Gross and microscopic lesions were found only in unvaccinated mice challenged with both lineages. Duvaxyn WNV vaccine provided complete protection against challenge with lineage 2 WNV and stimulated significant cross protective neutralising antibodies in mice against lineage 2.

The CTB also initiates applied research related to the National TB Control Programme (NTBCP). It furthermore advises and works closely with the Department of Health (DoH) on strategic planning and assists with policy and guideline formulation concerning the diagnosis and treatment of TB. The CTB is actively involved as a core function in monitoring trends in disease prevalence and TB drug resistance for ongoing evaluation of the impact of TB control measures instituted by the DoH, as well as early detection of, and integrated response to outbreaks. The Centre continued to utilise surveillance and microbiological data for the design and implementation of epidemiological research geared to advise and guide the national response to the TB epidemic. In support of these activities, the CTB plays a leading role in the evaluation and standardisation of new diagnostic methods for the country and assists with the development and implementation of an integrated surveillance system to serve as a platform for epidemiological planning and response. An important function of the CTB is to provide the DoH prospective data on the frequency of resistance to anti-TB drugs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in South Africa. For this purpose, the Centre provides information extracted from the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) of the NHLS for weekly notification of new rifampicin-resistant (RR), multidrug- resistant (MDR), and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases identified by laboratories of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) to provincial and district coordinators of the NTBCP . Such surveillance data are available for ongoing assessment of the impact of TB control activities of the DoH, as well as to inform TB control agencies of other Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries. SURVEILLANCE /DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES Integrated public health surveillance and reference laboratory services The CTB supports the NTBCP by conducting national surveillance of new cases of laboratory-confirmed TB, as well as new drug-resistant, including RR, MDR and XDR TB cases identified by NHLS laboratories. Information on drug resistance prevalence will advise on the performance of the NTBCP in pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals and provide guidance on directing human and financial resources to areas of need targeted for action. A complementary function of the CTB is to serve as a NTBRL where new molecular techniques are applied for M. tuberculosis strain characterisation in terms of drug resistance profiles, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) types, spoligotypes and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU) types. The CTB also houses a repository where M. tuberculosis strains, including molecularly characterised genotypes and phenotypes, are catalogued and stored. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 55TB surveillance based on data from corporate data and electronic TB registries The CDW has been storing TB diagnostic and treatment monitoring data collected routinely from eight provinces from 2004, and in addition from KwaZulu-Natal since 2011. In order to transform laboratory-based data to patient- based information, an automated system with electronic matching and allocation of unique patient identifiers was developed. Applying a \"probabilistic matching\" approach, the process of data matching was further improved. As the same laboratory tests are used for both diagnostic and treatment monitoring purposes, a specimen-level information system was transformed into a patient-level system while provision was also made to identify recurrent episodes over time in the same patient, reflecting re-infection or reactivation episodes. (Differentiation between the latter could be facilitated by DNA fingerprinting/genotyping, using whole genome sequencing and other molecular typing approaches - See molecular surveillance of TB) on page 57. The historical analysis of TB trends in South Africa between 2004 and 2012, using laboratory-based information, has been completed. This analysis has assessed changes at national and provincial levels and has been compared with the HIV prevalence and anti-retroviral (ARV) roll-out over the same period. The incidence rates for several provinces are above a 1000 per 100 000 population, which makes these regions among the highest incidence areas globally. Fifty-five percent of cases were males with an average age of 38 years, while among females the average age was 33 years. Thus the pattern is similar to that of the HIV epidemic, with the economically active age group most affected. A positive development is a decline nationally in TB incidence since 2008, a trend closely associated with the expansion of the ARV roll-out. CDW-based surveillance, linked to district and municipal access points, provides feedback information on the occurrence and nature of TB episodes, as well as laboratory requisition patterns (penetration rates). Such CDW- derived surveillance also provides good, timely and accurate information for the NTBCP , as well as to provincial health departments on RR-TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB (all three defined on laboratory criteria) and facilitates planning and management of drug-resistant TB in the country. Clinical data, including clinical profiles, treatment histories and treatment outcomes, collected via a TB clinic-based electronic register are being linked to the CDW data set. Such linking of clinical and laboratory data bases affords users a rich historical resource of TB in the country, and, analysed on a quarterly basis, can be correlated with data related to mortality, HIV prevalence and ARV treatment uptake. This will enable conclusions to be drawn on the evolution of the TB epidemic in the context of other relevant public health trends, including those demonstrated by monitoring data related to TB drug resistance. Drug resistance monitoring is being enhanced by matching laboratory generated drug resistance data with those of the Electronic Drug-Resistant TB Register (EDR), introduced to develop an interface that could, on a daily basis, transfer data relating to MDR- TB and XDR-TB patients into the EDRWeb of the national DoH. Integrating these data sets facilitates the identification of patients with laboratory confirmed drug-resistant isolates who fail to present for treatment. Thus, integrating these systems will present a comprehensive picture of the burden of disease, while the monitoring of linkage between diagnosis and treatment which is an essential element for reducing this burden, will further enhance patient management. Survey of drug resistance in TB in South Africa As part of the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUTLD) Global Tuberculosis Surveillance Project, a country-wide drug resistance survey (DRS) was started by the national DoH and CTB in June 2012. This major survey is designed to be nationally representative and is geared to determine the prevalence and trend of drug-resistant TB in the nine provinces, as well as describe on a population basis the types of MDR M. tuberculosis -complex strains circulating in the country and HIV prevalence in this group. A population-proportionate cluster sampling strategy was used to determine the sample size and the survey sites and to ensure that the survey population is representative of TB in each of the nine provinces of the country. This is survey is one of the largest of its kind globally, and patients are recruited from over 400 facilities over a year period. The unique design of this survey is the recruitment of suspects rather than cases allowing assessment of the drug resistance burden in both smear-positive and smear-negative patients - an important issue for high HIV/ AIDS settings like South Africa. An additional difference is the testing of all culture confirmed cases for a full range of drugs including second-line agents. This is important as the data will be essential to inform the applicability of new regimens that combine the new agents with existing agents and the levels of resistance to the latter is a critical factor that will influence the success or failure of these new interventions. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 56The survey is nearing completion with five of the nine provinces having ended their recruitment phase by early April 2014 and the last enrolments likely to be completed at the end of May 2014. The final report of the survey is expected to be completed at the end of 2014. The survey will record rates of drug resistance for each province with additional information on risk factors associated with drug-resistant TB. It has been over 10 years since the last survey was conducted and important changes have occurred since then, including several outbreaks of TB, greater awareness of XDR TB and the emergence of even more resistant types. The data will certainly be important for future policy making in the control of drug-resistant TB for South Africa. Prospective sentinel surveillance of rifampicin-resistant TB and TB/HIV integration in South Africa: GERMS-SA The implementation of the Xpert MTB/RIF rapid TB diagnostic test as the initial diagnostic test for people with presumed TB is now complete. With the realisation that rifampicin (RIF) resistance is not an absolute surrogate marker for MDR-TB and may vary between provinces, it was decided to study the clinical and epidemiological features of RIF monoresistance as an entity, as distinct from RIF resistance as part of MDR-TB in South Africa. Enhanced surveillance of RIF-resistant TB has been introduced at sentinel sites of the Group for Enteric Respiratory and Meningeal disease Surveillance in South Africa (GERMS-SA) in order to deliver accurate, timely and detailed information on risk factors such as previous treatment, close contacts, socio-economic and occupational factors, as well as HIV status and hospital admission data. Changes in the frequency, clonality and geographic distribution of RIF-resistant M. tuberculosis strains over time are of key interest to this surveillance activity. Enhanced surveillance of RIF resistance was initiated at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, Gauteng, in October 2012 and has now been introduced into five other provinces with the remainder to be completed by the end of 2014. A new sentinel surveillance project using the GERMS platform is being established in 2014 which will address an important gap that exists between the TB and HIV programmes that often run in parallel rather than together. This surveillance system will enable the country to monitor trends of patients with TB only, HIV only and TB with HIV and also assess changes in risk factors. Additionally, an important area that will be addressed is the prevalence of primary drug resistance for both HIV and TB. This is very important as empiric regimens for both diseases are currently used and the need for surveillance to monitor and feedback information on primary drug resistance is an essential requirement for policy formulation in the country. This project is expected to begin in the second half of 2014. TB as a cause of severe acute respiratory infections: SARI project Prospective, hospital-based sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) was initiated in South Africa in 2009 and TB, as a cause of SARI, was included in this programme in 2012. The incorporation of TB into the SARI programme was phased in, starting at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital (Gauteng), Edendale Hospital (KwaZulu-Natal), Mapulaneng and Matikwana Hospitals (Mpumalanga), and the Klerksdorp/Tsepong Hospital complex (North West Province). Together with oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens for general microbiological (virological, bacteriological and yeast) investigations, sputum samples were collected for TB culture and drug susceptibility testing, as well as for PCR-based molecular testing for rapid diagnosis. In addition, clinical and epidemiological information was collected relating to the onset and progression of symptoms, age group, HIV status and immunisation history as well as socio-demographic information through interview, hospital record, and the administration of a questionnaire. This surveillance system adds important information on late presentation TB disease and profiles the severe cases of TB with increased mortality, constituting a target of importance for policy decisions, Molecular surveillance of TB and Geospatial Scanning Strain typing for drug-resistant TB is now established at the Centre and is being integrated into its surveillance systems. Expertise in strain typing techniques, including spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) as well as IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing, is now available at the centre. Additionally, an automated system for IS 6110 RFLP typing has been acquired and recent validations have shown excellent concordance with the existing methods. This is an important improvement on the laborious conventional MIRU-VNTR gold standard typing method which is laborious and time consuming, and South Africa is now one among only a handful of countries with this sophisticated automated at its disposal. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 57The typing techniques have different discriminatory ability and are used in epidemiological studies involving surveillance and outbreak investigations. However, due to the high burden of disease and the endemicity of strain types in South Africa, the most appropriate tool for a specific setting is being evaluated. RFLP typing is performed by enzymatic restriction of the M. tuberculosis genome into fragments of different lengths, resulting in a distinctive pattern for each strain. RFLP typing has excellent discriminatory power, especially if a sufficient number insertion sites are present in the typed strains, and is regarded as the \"gold standard\" of M. tuberculosis strain typing. Spoligotyping is a PCR-based method to type M. tuberculosis complex bacteria and the underlying principle is DNA polymorphism present at the Direct Repeat (DR) chromosomal locus, uniquely present in M. tuberculosis complex bacteria. The level of differentiation by spoligotyping is less compared to IS6110 fingerprinting for strains having five or more IS6110 copies but higher for strains with less than five copies. It is useful for the identification of M. tuberculosis strains endemic in regions and the study of lineages involved in the evolution of the organism. MIRU typing is also PCR-based and targets mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units located in minisatellite- like regions, similar to those found in the human chromosome, and these regions comprise a variable number of tandemly repeated sequences (VNTR) in the M. tuberculosis genome. Primers specific for the flanking regions of these genetic elements are used for PCR amplification. MIRU typing has good discriminatory power and is often used in conjunction with spoligotyping. TB genotyping, when combined with epidemiologic data, helps to confirm epidemiologic links and detect outbreaks and unsuspected transmissions, and serves as a valuable tool for monitoring progress toward the elimination of TB transmission. The objectives of this project include the description of the genetic diversity and identification of genotypic clusters of MDR-TB in South Africa; assessment of the occurrence of common patterns of virulence and/ or drug resistance associated with genotypic clusters of MDR-TB in order to refine MDR-TB treatment strategies; assessment of epidemiological and demographical factors associated with genotypic clusters of MDR-TB in order to refine MDR-TB control strategies and, finally, the description of the molecular epidemiology of TB in South Africa and its monitoring. Such information could guide the implementation of vaccination programmes in future. It is clear that the drug-resistant TB epidemic in South Africa is not evenly distributed and the identification of hot spots is an important requirement for the effective implementation of control strategies in the country. In the past year the capacity to utilise geographical information systems (GIS) for surveillance has been expanded at the centre and this combined with the available molecular epidemiology data will allow early detection of hot spots of ongoing transmission, as well as determine the emergence of new clones of drug resistance and their temporal and geospatial evolution. Such information will allow for interventions to be planned and effectively applied. The surveillance project will initially focus on 11 high burden districts in South Africa. Introduction and evaluation of DNA sequencing platforms Sequencing to detect mutations is rapidly emerging as the method of choice for resistance determination and the introduction of several next-generation sequencing platforms is rapidly changing the sequencing landscape. The CTB has identified the value and importance of this technology as an essential tool required by TB reference laboratories for strain characterisation as well as its utility in surveillance and outbreak investigations. The overall cost of this technology has been decreasing steadily and the performance of whole genome sequencing has become more practical and cost effective compared with targeted sequencing. Furthermore, several recent publications have highlighted the role of compensatory mutations and mutations outside the known regions of resistance encoding as being important for the expression of drug resistance. The UK has already embarked on ambitious plans for whole genome sequencing (WGS) of M. tuberculosis strains and CTB is a major partner working with colleagues at the Oxford University and Cambridge University as part of ongoing collaboration with Public Health England. The knowledge and experiences shared will be mutually beneficial and will allow CTB to develop the sequencing capacity in South Africa The CTB has acquired a next- generation sequencer for WGS as a part of a surveillance project aimed at understanding resistance to pyrazanimide and fluoroquinolones as two key drugs planned for use with the new drug regimens. The MiSeq instrument (Illumina) has a high throughput per run with a low error rate. It is user friendly and has a low hands-on time because template amplification is carried out directly on the instrument without manual intervention. It is able to sequence fragments from both ends (paired-end mode) without changes to the library preparation stage or additional intervention during sequencing. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 58A workflow for performing WGS for TB at NICD is now established and the system optimised. Most of the processing is performed on the instrument and is automated. Additionally, the bioinformatics for extracting the resistance information from the WGS is being automated through a dashboard. These developments are important steps in establishing South Africa as a forerunner in the use of this first-world technology in the control of TB.. The instrument was placed at the Centre in 2013 and thus by early April 2014 over 600 whole genomes have been sequenced as part of a WHO project. This project involves sequencing of strains from two provinces (Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal) as part of the current drug resistance survey. The information is being analysed and will inform future screening technologies for drug resistance in South Africa and globally. The South African WGS data will also be compared with sequence data from four other countries: Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh and Belarus. Different sequencing approaches are being used with some using Sanger sequencing, others performing WGS (South Africa is presently the only country performing WGS). The project is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. The project has been valuable in developing WGS capacity at the CTB. It is likely that WGS will replace earlier sequencing technology in the medium term. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of anti-TB drugs The CTB introduced in 2013 minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination of M. tuberculosis strains, a technique not generally available in TB laboratories. MIC testing will allow the laboratory to differentiate between strains with mutations associated respectively with high or low levels of resistance to anti-TB drugs. This is an important development as new data are emerging on the need to re-evaluate standard drug concentrations based on the PK/PD modelling. Thus the ability to determine MICs and also to have data on MICs of circulating strains will be important to determine if current treatment regimens for TB are optimal for both HIV-infected and HIV-negative patients. As another project, the CTB started the evaluation and comparison of liquid medium-based MIC methods, including the VersaTREK Culture System (TREK Diagnostics)and an adapted MGIT 960 system (Becton Dickinson)- based method, with a solid medium-based MIC agar proportion method. Early findings have shown good overall performance: the methods are easy to perform, rendering them suitable for operational settings. The new VersaTrek-based MIC testing method is also being applied to drug-resistant strains identified in the ongoing DRS and will provide an important baseline for future trend analysis. Additionally, drug susceptibility testing for rifabutin susceptibility is also available and initial findings indicate that a small proportion of RIF-resistant strains exhibit low rifabutin MIC values. This finding will be further investigated. National TB Repository A national TB repository is being established at the CTB as a national resource for the surveillance of TB in South Africa. This will be a unique resource that will house a variety of data from different sources of information on epidemiology, microbiology and geospatial distribution of TB in South Africa. It will, in addition, incorporate a national mycobacterial culture collection of isolates stored in the repository, which will serve as an important source of culture material and information related to TB surveillance. It will also facilitate and encourage research and development, and provide reference material for monitoring the evolution of unusual cases of TB and TB strains detected through the network of laboratories in South Africa. A schematic illustration of the structure of the data repository is shown in the figure below. The surveillance data generated by the CTB will available to be accessed through the portal. Progress is being made with the establishment of this system. In addition, isolates are stored and archived using specialised software systems after following quality assurance processes to ensure the integrity of this national asset. An important element of the repository is a dashboard which will allow registered users to access different levels of the data dependent on the permissions given on the tier access structure. The dashboard will allow users to access information on the epidemiology of TB down to district level, assess trends over time and have the information displayed in chart or map format. The implementation of the system and access will done in phases with general TB epidemiology data being made available during the first phase. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 59New and Emerging diagnostics The CTB continues to evaluate new technologies for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of TB, as well as for surveillance studies. Some of these exciting molecular-based methods evaluated by the CTB produce rapid results and promise to revolutionise management of drug-susceptible and especially drug-resistant TB. Several evaluation studies are underway, assessing the performance of competitor line probe assays for the diagnosis of RIF- and isoniazid-resistant TB. Additionally, evaluation of an assay for the molecular diagnosis of pyrazanimide resistance is scheduled to start in May 2014. A \"collection to detection\" system has been evaluated for the diagnosis of TB compared with Xpert MTB/RIF at laboratories and points of care and this data should be available soon. In addition the use of specialised \"kits\" for next- generation sequencing, using a targeted approach, are being assessed to detect several drug resistance genetic targets. A similar approach is being investigated using a \"digital\" PCR format. A major need for the future of TB control is diagnostics that can detect resistance to agents other than RIF and this is a key focus of the CTB. In addition, evaluation of alternative screening algorithms and diagnostic/sampling approaches are also being considered. Evaluation of the TBDx automated computer-aided smear microscopy system of for diagnosis and use as a cost-effective screening tool NICD Researchers: N Ismail, S Omar, A Dreyer Collaborators: J Lewis, D Dowdy, H van der Meulen, D Clark, G Churchyard This study is a joint venture of the Aurum Institute for Health Research, Guardian Technologies International, USA and the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory/CTB to develop and evaluate the performance of an automated computer-aided smear microscopy system involving digital image scanning of M. tuberculosis cells in sputum smears stained with the fluorescent Auramine O stain. The evaluation of the new improved system showed excellent performance as a stand-alone system for TB microscopy which matched a microscopy gold standard of a combined 80 years of experience. A second important finding was the utility of the system to be used as a screening tool to Xpert MTB/RIF. The algorithm incorporating both the TBDx and Xpert MTB/RIF shows that this approach achieved a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 99%, whilst reducing the overall use of Xpert MTB/RIF by 75%. Host and pathogen contributions in the emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: Cross- sectional and prospective observational studies NICD Researchers: N Ismail, L Erasmus Collaborators: G Kaplan, D Fallows, B Kreiswirth, C Gray, K Klipstein-Grobusch As part of the first of a two-phase cross-sectional investigation on pathogen-related factors playing a role in the MDR/XDR-TB epidemic in Gauteng, more than 300 M. tuberculosis drug-resistant isolates from Gauteng province have undergone molecular typing and drug resistance profiling. The initial results showed important clonal differences of the MDR epidemic in Gauteng, compared with published data from other provinces, and indicated clonality in a sizable proportion of strains exhibiting drug resistance. The second phase of the cross-sectional study, three years after the first, is underway. This study will provide information on drug-resistance-related mutations in M. tuberculosis isolates in Gauteng and indicate changes in mutation profiles of isolates over a three-year period. In a related longitudinal study, cultures from sputum specimens from 200 newly admitted MDR/XDR-TB patients at Sizwe Hospital (100 HIV-positive and 100 HIV-negative) were collected at monthly intervals for the investigation of the acquisition of drug-resistance-determining mutations over time. Genes encoding resistance to isoniazid (katG and sequenced when relevant, including WGS on a selective basis. Clonality similar to that observed in the cross sectional study was encountered but evidence of amplification of drug resistance during therapy was also observed. Additional components of this study conducted by collaborating researchers include immunological profiling of cytokines and other biomarkers, as well as, measurements relating to changing nutritional status before and during treatment. Early findings have identified a putative immunological marker predictive of culture conversion to resistance. These are early but important findings that are still under investigation. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 60Novel methods for diagnosis of paediatric tuberculosis NICD Researchers: N Ismail, S Omar Collaborators: A van Rie, C Hanarahan Confirmation of the diagnosis of paediatric TB remains a challenge, due to paucibacillary specimens collected for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB in children, and the difficulty for young children to produce sputum on demand. It is widely acknowledged that there is an urgent need for novel approaches to confirm TB diagnosis in children, especially young children with intrathoracic disease, the most frequent type of childhood TB. While it is important for studies of novel diagnostics to be conducted in a wide range of settings, none have investigated the performance of novel diagnostics for paediatric TB at lower level hospitals or community clinics, settings where the vast majority of children first present for care. This cohort study evaluates innovative approaches for the diagnosis of TB in young children presenting at a primary care facility, as well as the utility of using alternative samples for TB diagnosis in these children. It furthermore examines the feasibility of contact tracing in this setting. HIV Incidence Provincial Surveillance System (HIPSS): A longitudinal sub -study to monitor TB prevalence and incidence trends in the uMgungundlovu District, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa NICD Toledo, Gavin George, Kaymarlin Govender, Alex Welte, et al. Despite improvements in HIV related morbidity and mortality, the rate of new HIV infections remain unacceptably high. In response to the provincial and national priorities to better monitor HIV incidence in high prevalence areas, the HIV Incidence Provincial Surveillance System (HIPSS) is being established in two sub-districts in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The cohort is a household-based representative sample of men and women in sub-districts of Vulindlela and the Greater Edendale in the uMgungundlovu municipality of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. For the sub-study, the prevalence and incidence of TB, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection will be measured at baseline and at follow-up. This data will be important in determining the rate of new infections and will inform planning of programmatic interventions. Xpert for people attending HIV/AIDS care: Test or Hanifa, H van der Meulen, G Churchyard This study aims to evaluate strategies for prioritisation of cases with increased likelihood of mortality or transmission, and to assess the impact of this stratified algorithm on the NTBCP . Patients stratified as a high priority based on risk factor criteria are assigned for rapid Xpert MTB/RIF assay testing, as opposed to those assigned a lower priority. All patients undergo follow-up and monitoring to determine the optimal pathway to diagnosis in the context of Xpert MTB/RIF testing. The study is progressing well and is nearing the final stages of enrolment.

Erasmus Collaborators: Shah, R Rustomjee, B Kreiswirth Following the disastrous Tugela Ferry outbreak of XDR-TB in KwaZulu-Natal in 2006, the present study was designed to investigate prospectively transmission of XDR-TB in that province. The study aims to determine the proportion of new XDR-TB cases with primary drug resistance, identify risk factors associated with such transmission through epidemiological and social network analysis and, using molecular genotyping, to demonstrate transmission patterns involving persons and locations associated with XDR-TB transmission. For this study, the CTB collaborates with Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital Laboratory, which is responsible for all DST testing in KwaZulu-Natal and refer all laboratory-based XDR-TB isolates from KwaZulu-Natal for confirmatory testing and molecular characterisation. Additional information on risk factors is collected and transmission to close contacts is investigated. Strong emphasis is placed on understanding the transmission dynamics among XDR cases in this high-burden TB and HIV province. The study is progressing well and an additional component has been added using WGS to elucidate transmission dynamics under higher resolution conditions, as well as the micro-evolutionary pathway of MDR-/XDR-TB. Teaching and training Training accommodating experiential as well as didactic learning has been offered to technical laboratory staff from two countries. This has been important in developing capacity in the respective countries. In addition, CTB has participated in developing a train-the-trainer course for SADC countries which will be implemented through the SADC secretariat. Additional training covering both reference mycobacteriology testing and public health aspects of TB is provided to rotating registrars from university-based medical microbiology departments in South Africa, as well as to intern scientists in the country. In addition CTB mentored a FELTP student, further expanding capacity in epidemiology in South Africa.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 63CENTRE FOR VACCINES AND IMMUNOLOGY AFP stain show Microbacterium tuberculosis (TB) Dr Melinda Suchard Centre Head NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 64BACKGROUND The Centre for Vaccines and Immunology has been established to provide laboratory and epidemiological support to three vaccination programmes within the Expanded Programme on Immunisation - polio, measles and hepatitis - as well as to carry out appropriate research to answer public health questions related to vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases. In addition to the national and provincial Departments of Health, which are the major stakeholders, the Centre functions as regional reference laboratories for polio and measles for the World Health Organization (WHO). National Polio surveillance As part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, the Centre for Vaccines and Immunology serves as the national reference laboratory for poliovirus isolation. South Africa is monitored by international bodies, such as the WHO, in terms of meeting adequacy indicators for surveillance of poliovirus, including a minimum case detection rate of two suspected acute flaccid paralysis cases per 100 000 population. Stool samples from cases of acute flaccid paralysis are inoculated into cell culture, and any samples with suggestive cytopathic effects undergo molecular characterisation, including sequencing. South Africa has not had a case of endemic polio since 1989, but constant vigilance is required for imported cases. Molecular typing is required to differentiate circulating strains of Sabin vaccine virus from wild polio virus. The Centre processed more than 2 500 samples during the year. Data is shared and cases classified by the National Polio Expert Committee based on history, clinical notes and laboratory findings. Additionally, the Centre provides expertise to the National Task Force and National Certification Committees for polio containment in all laboratories nationally. Measles surveillance In 2011, the WHO Regional Committee for Africa established the 2020 measles elimination goal. Routine measles vaccination coverage was selected as an indicator of progress towards achieving the Millenium Development Goal 4 (to reduce the overall number of deaths among children under five years of age by two-thirds from 1990 to 2015). It is estimated that measles deaths have declined by 71% globally from 2000-2012. The last large outbreak of measles in South Africa occurred in 2009/2010, with over 18 000 reported cases. The Centre for Vaccines and Immunology is the national referral laboratory for measles surveillance. Serology, specifically the detection of measles- specific IgM antibodies, is the mainstay of diagnosis of acute measles infection. The Centre tested more than 8 000 specimens this year in support of the national measles surveillance programme. There were 11 sporadic South African measles cases detected with no clustering. The Centre reports case-based data to the National Department of Health and the WHO, and aggregated data to the Multisectoral National Outbreak Response Team (MNORT). The Centre works closely with the National Expanded Programme on Immunisation Task Group to classify cases and monitor susceptibility. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 65RESEARCH AND SPECIAL PROJECTS Hepatitis B surveillance Collaborators: Ms S Woodhall, Dr F Ncube (Public Health England), Dr E Prentice (national Department of Health) Hepatitis B is a highly infectious virus transmitted by contact with blood or body fluids which causes chronic sequelae such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The virus poses an occupational health risk for medical staff. Vaccination against Hepatitis B has been part of the routine expanded programme of immunisation in South Africa since 1995. The NICD, together with collaborators, initiated a steering committee comprising representatives from the National Cancer Registry, South African Blood Services (SANBS), clinicians (state and private), academic institutes, Public Health England and the National Department of Health. The aim is hereof is to form a national Hepatitis B surveillance network to focus on strengthening data on hepatitis B infection and disease, and to analyse epidemiological trends to guide national policy and guidelines on prevention. The network will map out existing reportable passive data sources and decide on optimal plans for active surveillance. Regional Polio surveillance Collaborators: WHO Funding source: WHO The Centre serves as a Regional Reference Laboratory for polio detection in the WHO AFR region, as well as in other African countries. Detection of poliovirus requires labour intensive cell culture isolation methods followed by molecular typing and sequencing. Strict laboratory containment measures are essential for working with a pathogen that has been eliminated in South Africa. There remain three countries worldwide with endemic polio virus (Pakistan, Afgahanistan and Nigeria), but 2013/2014 saw outbreaks of polio virus in previously polio free areas. The Centre confirmed 75 samples from four countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Cameroon) as wild poliovirus type 1 and two as vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) type 2 (Angola and Niger). These results helped inform the regional outbreak response to the identification of wild type virus in previously polio free countries. The early identification of wild poliovirus and VDPVs is vital for immediate action in the endgame strategy for global polio eradication. Additionally, the Centre provided onsite support to the Inter-Country Polio Laboratory at the Kenya Medical Research Institute as a WHO consultant. The objectives of this were successfully completed, namely the provision of onsite support for testing of acute flaccid paralysis samples to clear the rapidly building backlog, assessment and sensitisation of biosafety in handling specimens, revision of standard operating procedures and training of extra Technicians. Shutterstock: Rubella - German measles NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 66Regional Measles and Rubella surveillance Collaborators: WHO Funding source: WHO Despite intensive efforts to improve measles vaccination coverage globally in order to meet regional elimination and development of goals, global coverage appears to have leveled off. In Africa, very few countries currently offer a second measles vaccine dose in their routine immunisation schedules and rely on periodic supplementary campaigns to provide the second dose. This inadequate coverage is reflected in the global measles outbreak data since January 2012, where seven large measles outbreaks occurred in Africa. The Centre tests specimens from nine African countries (Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe) for measles and rubella as part of the WHO regional quality assurance programme. Additionally, support was given to Namibia during several measles outbreaks. Regionally, intensified efforts are required to increase coverage with two doses of measles vaccine through routine immunisation services, sustaining the implementation of the 'reaching every district' approach, use of supplementary immunisation activities and introduction of a second dose in the routine immunisation schedule where it is not yet offered. Hepatitis C surveillance Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus that causes acute and chronic liver disease. Groups at high risk include those with sexually transmitted infections, men who have sex with men and injecting drug users. There is currently no effective vaccine against hepatitis C. There is a paucity of data on Hepatitis C incidence and prevalence in South Africa. The centre is collating Hepatitis C prevalence and genotyping data. Passive surveillance data from healthy blood donors is collected in collaboration with the South African National Blood Service. Genotyping information can be used to predict response to treatment, with genotype 1 being less responsive and requiring longer treatment than genotype 2 or 3. Genotype 1 (46%) was found predominantly in the anonymous blood donations, followed by 5a (29%) and 3 (17%). Laboratory-based data from diagnosed patient populations is accessed via the National Health Laboratory Service. Genotype 5a accounted for 30% of the 4 mixed intergenotypic infections (5%). Improvement in laboratory vaccinology techniques While immunity to most vaccines is measured via serology, cellular immunity and neutralising antibodies are more difficult to monitor. The Centre has have established a laboratory with capacity for viral neutralisation assays for polio, measles and Respiratory Syncitial Virus. Additionally, the laboratory is equipped with a Luminex bead based flow cytometer for multiplexed serological assays of small sample volumes. Such techniques will be optimised for the detection of immunity and evaluated as alternatives to current assays. The assays will be used to assess durability and levels of immunity to measles, pneumococcus, RSV and other pathogens. The assessment of the combined oral/inactivated polio immunisation schedule in an African setting. South Africa is the first African country to have implemented an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) into the expanded programme of immunisation schedule. The WHO endgame includes plans that every country should implement an IPV within the next few years. Effects of the changed schedule on immunity in a Southern African setting have not been assessed. Sera archived at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, prior to the introduction of IPV, will be compared to sera collected after the introduction of IPV for polio neutralising antibodies. Samples from infants at six weeks, 18 weeks, 18 months and three years will be tested for polio neutralising antibodies using the modified polio neutralisation assay against all three polio serotypes. Additionally, the influence of HIV exposure will be determined. These results will inform policy regarding the switch from oral polio virus (OPV) to IPV containing regimens. Professional development The Centre holds weekly CPD accredited journal clubs and monthly presentations by staff and students on the theme of vaccines and immunology. The Centre also provides input to the National Health Laboratory Service Immunology Expert Committee with the aim of upskilling the next generation of scientists and clinicians with expertise in immunology and vaccinology.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 69DIVISION OF PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE Shutterstock: Ebola virus NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 70BACKGROUND The Public Health Surveillance and Response Division includes the Outbreak Unit, the GERMS-SA surveillance programme, Travel Health and the Communications Unit. The division facilitates communication and data sharing between the national and provincial health departments, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the public. It provides epidemiological input to other NICD units through collaborative projects and support of surveillance and epidemiological activities, outbreak responses. The Division has expanded significantly in 2013/14. A GERMS programme for surveillance for a number of priority conditions in rural and urban clinics is in the process of being established in all nine provinces supported by a network of NICD appointed epidemiologists. As a legacy of the 2010 FIFA World Cup event, a Mass Gatherings Centre has been established as part of the WHO Mass Gathering Global Network to support research and operational activities on communicable disease monitoring and risk assessments. The South African National Travel Health Network (SaNTHNeT) was established together with the NDoH and South African Travel Medicine Society in August 2013 to provide reliable and current information and guidelines for travellers to the Southern African region. The NICD Communications Unit has been incorporated into this division to strengthen and expand a role in conveying important public health messages and outbreak alerts to both the medical and allied professionals. The National Outbreak Unit has continued in its support of all outbreak-related activities, as part of the National Outbreak unit. The Mass Gatherings Centre was established to support research and operational activities on communicable disease monitoring and risk assessments Prof Lucille Blumberg Division HeadThe division facilitates communication and data sharing between the national and provincial health departments and the NICD NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 71GERMS-SA Surveillance/diagnostic services GERMS-SA is a laboratory-based surveillance programme for diseases of public health importance. It is coordinated by the National Microbiology Surveillance Unit (NMSU) and spans many of the centres at the NICD. The laboratory GERMS-SA is an active surveillance programme and relies not only on participating laboratories to submit isolates, but also makes use of the NHLS Corporate Data Warehouse to ensure that all cases meeting the case definition are included in the database. Annually approximately 200 microbiology laboratories, nationally, report roughly 13 000 cases meeting the GERMS-SA case definitions. The enhanced surveillance arm is operational at 25 sentinel sites across the country where 30 surveillance officers collect clinical information on patients relating to specific pathogens: invasive S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, N. meningitidis, TB. The aim of GERMS-SA is to use the data to inform and guide public health policy makers in their decisions. The objectives include estimating the burden of both community- and hospital-acquired infectious diseases under surveillance, monitoring antimicrobial susceptibility trends, monitoring the impact of the HIV/AIDS Comprehensive Care, Management and Treatment Programme in SA on HIV-associated opportunistic infections, and evaluating the impact of vaccines included in the Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI). The work carried out by the GERMS- SA team has significantly contributed to the development of clinical guidelines for pneumonia, meningococcal disease, cholera, cryptococcosis, typhoid fever, contributed to the situational analysis of antibiotic resistance in South Africa., and the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine as well as a booster dose for Haemophilus influenzae type b into the EPI. Data emanating from the GERMS-SA activities have also contributed to the DoH roll out of the cryptococcal antigen screening programme to facilitate the early diagnosis, and hence treatment, of cryptococcal meningitis. GERMS-SA work is funded through the NHLS and a CDC cooperative agreement, and more recently by the DoH.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 72Expansion of the GERMs platform: Xpert MTB/RIF Xpert MTB/RIF, a rapid diagnostic test that detects both Mycobacterium tuberculosis and resistance to rifampicin, has been implemented in all NHLS laboratories nationally and will be now the initial diagnostic test for all TB suspects in South Africa. In response to this implementation, enhanced surveillance for Xpert rifampicin resistant TB was initiated at Chris Hani Baragwaneth Hospital and selected surrounding clinics late in October 2012, and has subsequently been introduced into five other provinces. This surveillance will monitor trends over time, estimate the proportion of Multi-Drug Resistant TB among rifampicin resistant TB cases and the burden of resistance to other TB drugs, and provide information on risk factors including close contact, occupational history and HIV status. Surveillance will be initiated in the remaining three provinces during 2014. Research projects Zoonosis Diseases Study Investigators: V Quan1, J Frean1, G 1 J Rossouw1, A Hulth3, L Blumberg1 1.

The area is bordered by the Kruger National Park and contact between wildlife, livestock and humans is frequent. This is a One-Health study and done in collaboration with veterinary practitioners and researchers from the University of Pretoria Veterinary Faculty. The aims of the project: Describe the prevalence of zoonotic infections in adult patients presenting with acute febrile illness, who tested negative for malaria. Describe the prevalence of previous zoonotic infections in healthy herders and veterinary staff at the dip tanks. Between October 2012 through June 2013, consenting malaria-negative adult patients with acute febrile illness (AFI) were enrolled if they matched the study criteria of current temperature over 37.5\u00b0C or a history of fever in the last 72 hours. Epidemiological information was gathered around exposures and practices that would pose a potential risk for zoonosis. Lab testing was done by PCR and serology for brucellosis, bartonella infections, leptospirosis, Q-fever, tick bite fever (TBF), West Nile virus, Sindbis, Rift Valley fever and chikungunya virus infections. Additionally, healthy herders and veterinary staff at five dip tanks were tested for past zoonoses. Seventy four patients were enrolled and 64 healthy adult herders/veterinary staff were recruited. Conclusion: TBF and bartonella were shown to be causes of acute febrile illness, suggesting a need to review standard antibiotic regimens for acute febrile illness. Rodent control, as a source of bartonella infections, needs to be addressed. There was a high background exposure to TBF, Q fever and leptospirosis in the Mnisi community in both patients presenting with AFI and herders and veterinary staff.200 microbiology laboratories, nationally, report roughly 13 000 cases meeting the GERMS-SA case definition NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 73Smart phones used for improving the timeliness of infectious disease reporting in rural South Africa Investigators: Vanessa Quan 1, 2, Lucille Blumberg 1, 2, Gerdalize Kok 3, Anette Hulth 4 1.

A designated nurse reported patient-level data on positive malaria cases from three clinics in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa from October 2012 to May 2013. A key component of the malaria elimination strategy is a 24-hour reporting time for confirmed malaria cases to allow rapid follow-up and management of additional cases by malaria field staff. The use of a notification sent via SMS from a mobile phone for each newly diagnosed malaria case was acceptable to users and was technically feasible in this rural area and significantly improved the timeliness of data transmission Consideration should be given to large-scale use, possibly using a toll-free phone service, within the provincial malaria control programmes.Early morning at the dip tank: veterinary staff and herders with their cattle showing close contact Teaching SR Ennica, a 70-year-old nurse, how to use the cell phone to capture data on malaria cases, zoonotic diseases and reporting dog bites and diarrhoeal diseases for the project.SR Ennica interviewing and taking blood from herders at the dip tank, to assess risk factors and baseline seroprevalence for zoonoses in healthy herders, Mpumalanga NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 74OUTBREAK RESPONSE UNIT The Outbreak Response Unit (ORU) provides technical support for all aspects of communicable disease outbreaks and control in South Africa. Through close collaboration with provincial and national health departments and other stakeholders, together with systems for early detection and improved reporting of epidemic-prone communicable diseases, the ORU functions as a source of intelligence for outbreak detection and facilitates comprehensive outbreak response activities. In addition, close partnerships with NHLS diagnostic laboratories and NICD centres provide appropriate laboratory diagnostic services during outbreaks and specialised diagnostic testing as required. In April 2012, the National Department of Health Communicable Diseases Directorate and the ORU became functionally integrated as the National Outbreak Unit, a platform for synergistic outbreak detection and response activities throughout the country. Public health services The ORU's role in outbreaks may include, but is not limited to, the following: outbreak detection and reporting, field investigation, development of clinical and laboratory guidelines, management of laboratory data and interpretation of results, and recommendations for prevention and control. During the year, the ORU assisted with the investigation and response to a wide spectrum of outbreaks, (106 in total), including: Rotavirus outbreaks in KwaZulu-Natal and Northern Cape Foodborne illness outbreaks, Institutional in KwaZulu-Natal province Odyssean malaria, Gauteng Province. In January 2014 severe malaria was confirmed in two persons residents in the south of Johannesburg, close to a highway. Neither had a history of travel to a malaria transmission area and they were not epidemiologically linked. There was no evidence of breeding of anopheles mosquitoes in their households or surrounds and this was likely Odyssean malaria due to imported mosquitoes. Both patients recovered. Did You Know?

Rotavirus was the most common pathogen identified. However, a range of other enteric viruses was also detected, mostly occurring as mixed infections with rotavirus. The increase in diarrhoeal illness cases reported in both Siyanda District and eThekwini Metropolitan coincided with the occurrence of the annual rotavirus season which typically occurs in South Africa between April and August every year. The magnitude of the increase in diarrhoea-related cases was, however, perceived as being higher than previous post- rotavirus vaccine introduction years. Possible reasons for the increase in diarrhoea cases include, among others , suboptimal rotavirus vaccine coverage as well as possibly a 'biennial peak' phenomenon - although the latter was not supported by the Rotavirus Surveillance Programme data from non-KZN sites for 2013. Data from the NICD Rotavirus Surveillance Programme (implemented in April 2009, with seven sites in five provinces [including KZN but not NCP] at present) did not show an overall increase in either the number of cases eligible for enrolment in the study (children <5 years of age admitted to hospital for acute diarrhoea) or the rotavirus detection rate during 2013 as compared to previous post-vaccine introduction rotavirus seasons. However, data from the rotavirus surveillance programme for the KwaZulu-Natal sites showed that the number of stool samples tested during the 2013 rotavirus season was higher than in previous post-rotavirus vaccine introduction years, but the proportion of rotavirus-positive cases was comparable to that reported in previous post-rotavirus vaccine introduction years. The ORU continued to strengthen networks for the reporting and investigation of foodborne illness, with close to 60 foodborne illness outbreaks reported and followed up. The ORU supported communicable disease monitoring during key mass gathering events, including the Nelson Mandela Memorial week and funeral activities, and the 2014 African Championship (CHAN) by providing daily surveillance data and communicable disease intelligence updates to relevant stakeholders. The CDW alert system, managed by the ORU, facilitates timely notification of laboratory-confirmed cases of priority communicable diseases detected by NHLS laboratories the country ( Typhi, Vibrio cholerae, Neisseria meningitidis and Bordetella pertussis ) to healthcare and public health workers. The OutNet programme is an NHLS laboratory-based outbreak network with nine provincial laboratory OutNet representatives who act as the key points of contact for provincial public health staff and facilitate laboratory functions in outbreak detection and response. As NOU, the ORU assisted with the development of provincial and national guidelines for priority communicable diseases. Residents of the Field Epidemiology Programme are seconded to the ORU for 8 weeks to gain field experience of outbreaks under supervision. The ORU publishes a monthly Communicable Diseases Communiqu\u00e9, which reports recent outbreak and communicable disease cases/issues of relevance. This is distributed to a wide audience including: general practitioners, specialists, infectious diseases and travel medicine societies, and national and provincial public health personnel. In addition, the unit publishes special urgent advisories and communiqu\u00e9s in response to acute events requiring immediate dissemination of information. Research Projects Pertussis surveillance project Investigators: Dr Juno Thomas and Genevie Ntshoe (ORU, NICD); Dr Gary Reubenson (Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital and University of the Witwatersrand); Dr Ranmini Kularatne (National Health Laboratory Service). Research funding: Sanofi Pasteur Project summary: This hospital-based project based at a single site in Gauteng Province aims to describe the prevalence and characteristics of pertussis disease amongst children <10 years of age who are hospitalised with suggestive respiratory illness, or in the case of infants and young children, present with apnoea for investigation. With informed consent from caregivers, key clinical data is recorded and nasopharyngeal swabs are collected for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis PCR testing as well as culture for Bordetella spp. Case enrolment in ongoing and will continue until September 2014. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 76TRAVEL HEAL TH This unit provides a consultative service for health practitioners regarding pre-travel advice for travellers and clinical consultations for returning travellers with suspected infectious diseases; develops guidelines for a number of travel-related diseases and neglected diseases; serves as a point of contact and liaison internationally for infectious diseases acquired in southern Africa, and assists with training of travel health practitioners and those studying tropical diseases. There is a focus on zoonotic diseases and emerging pathogens through the One Health approach brought about by the interactions between animal and human health and the environment. South African National Travel Health Network (SANTHNet) http://www.santhnet.co.za The SANTHNET is a travel health network run by the National Department of Health (NDoH), the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the South African Society of Travel Medicine (SASTM), and was launched in August 2013. The SANTHNET provides up-to-date information on health risks for travel in the southern African region, with a primary South African focus through developing and providing guidelines on communicable diseases and up-to- date information on disease outbreaks. An informative website has been developed and has attracted a significant number of nationally and internationally visits each month. The network will focus on developing guidelines around travel related health matters. The network will serve as a surveillance platform to gather information around imported communicable diseases e.g. dengue, trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis as well as expert advice on diagnosis and management of tropical and travel related diseases. The Unit also manages a supply of essential drugs for a selection of tropical and neglected diseases e.g.leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis and severe malaria. WHO collaborating centres on health at mass gatherings http://www.who.int/ihr/publications/mass_gatherings/en/ The Mass Gatherings Centre was established for communicable disease surveillance and risk assessment for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and has now become a part of the WHO 6-centre Mass Gatherings Collaborating Centre network (Disaster Research Centre, Flinders University, Australia; Public Health England, United Kingdom; National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), South Africa; Institute of Public Health of Vojvodina, Serbia; School of Public Health, University of Washington, United States of America; Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia). Mass gathering events that were covered by the division and which included daily reporting on risks and potential risks included:- 2014 African Nations Championship - 11 January to 1 February 2014 in South Africa World Transplant Games - 28 July to 4 August 2013 in Durban, South Africa Nelson Mandela Memorial - 5 to 15 December 2013 in South Africa Shutterstock: real Trypanosoma photomicrograph panorama.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 77NICD COMMUNICATIONS UNIT In the past year, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) Communication Unit has actively expanded its role in conveying important public health messages and outbreak alerts to both the medical and allied professionals through guidelines and information sheets, as well as to the general public through media releases, interviews on TV, radio and the print media and through the introduction of social media. An active website has continued to grow in attracting the general public, the media and health professionals. To meet the increasing demands for this, media training for senior staff was undertaken. A general review of the NICD website is planned for the coming year with an interim updating of all Centre information. A new electronic format has been successfully developed for disseminating the NICD publications with stakeholders in the public and private sector and national and provincial Departments of Health. These include the monthly communiqu\u00e9 which highlights current communicable disease events and outbreaks, the monthly NICD surveillance bulleting which collates data from the NICD surveillance programmes, and the quarterly bulletin which documents more formally outbreaks and surveillance programmers. New internal publications have been developed: NICD Science Focus, a quarterly compilation of abstracts of scientific publications by NICD staff members published in peer- reviewed journals; NICD newsletter which has a more informal focus on events and happening at the NICD, and staff awards and profiles individual staff members and their work.

OVERVIEW The South African Regional Global Disease Detection Centre (SARGDDC) is a collaborative partnership between the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) the National South Africa Department of Health (NDoH) and the National Institute for Communicable Disease (NICD). The SARGDDC was established in 2010 by the CDC as the eighth of ten global programmes. The core function of the GDD is to integrate with activities and programmes of partners in order to prevent; detect and effectively respond to infectious disease threats. The SARGDDC provides the platform for building capacity through four different focused programmes: the South African Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme; the Influenza Programme; the International Emerging Infections Programme; and the recently established One Health Programme. The SARGDDC collaborates on specific activities with the DoH, NICD and other partners and supplements some activities through research and non-research co-operative agreements. HIGHLIGHTS The appointment of Ms Dorothy Southern, MPH-International Health, as a Scientific Writer and Mr Alfred Musekiwa MSc as a biostatistician provided the opportunity to build capacity in scientific writing and biostatistics. Transfer of these scarce and critical skills is intended to advance the quality of research outputs for emerging researchers. Professor Marietjie Venter has been appointed as the One Health Programme Director in March 2014 and will drive the interdisciplinary collaboration in aspects of health care for humans, animals and the environment. SURVEILLANCE The SARGDDC Co-Directors assisted with the formulation of the Terms of Reference for the National Surveillance Coordinating Forum established by the Deputy Minister of Health, and supported the drafting of the National Surveillance Strategy Document. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES | ANNUAL REVIEW 2013 - 2014 83SPECIAL PROJECTS The SARGDDC has 18 collaborative projects with the NDoH and NICD, and employs 40 staff through these co- operative agreements.
