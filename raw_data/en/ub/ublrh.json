Fai Chan Deli Aroma LLC, USA Abstract To many, it is unavoidable that, due to hormonal changes, they will experience hot flashes in the menopause stage. Nowadays, people will avoid eating some hot food that can trigger hot flashes... but is it worth depriving the enjoyment of life? For example, let's say you need garlic, ginger or cayenne pepper to heal some ailments. Without the use of Chili oil, you may not have good micro circulation especially you are getting older. In general, rubefacient food or thermic food is necessary to improve your cir culation and mind function as your body metabolism starts to slow down. In this speech, I will examine two case studies that use herbal soak with \"hot\" steam on the patients. This procedure did not trigger any redness or hot flashes on their body, as a ma tter of fact, it reduced their hot flashes and made them sleep better. Thermic food or Rubefacient is necessary for detox \u2014 especially in menopause. This is an exploratory study in examining how Rubefacient / Thermic food can slow the aging process. At the same time, it counters the effects of hot flashes. Biography Fai Chan started her career in Clinical Aromatherapy in 2014.
