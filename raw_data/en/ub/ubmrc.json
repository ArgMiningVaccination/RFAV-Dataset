A BSTRACT The effectiveness of average weekly inundative releases of female Eretmocerus er- emicus (evaluated in 2 greenhouses) and Encarsia formosa Beltsville strain (evalu- ated in 2 greenhouses) per plant for control of Bemisia argentifolii Bellow and Perring was determined on colored poinsettia plants grown under commercial conditions. Par-asitoid efcacy was determined by making weekly population counts of B. argentifolii lifestages (excluding eggs) on plants exposed to parasitoids in biological control green- houses and comparing nal per leaf densities of B. argentifolii nymphs to those plants in insecticide treated greenhouses. At the 2 sites where E. eremicus was used, nal nymphal densities ranged from 2-4 per leaf when a sales inspection protocol was em-ployed at time of harvest. On insecticide-treated plants, nymphs ranged 0.02-0.18 perleaf but nal whitefly densities in biological control greenhouses and insecticidegreenhouses were commercially acceptable. Colored plants at one site where E . ere- micus was used were harvested and sold without any insecticide use. At the second E . eremicus site, two sulfotepp applications were made at week 11 of the 16 week trial and colored plants were harvested without further use of insecticides. In comparisonto insecticides, the cost of E . eremicus in 1995 ($2.70 per plant) was 30 times higher than using imidacloprid ($0.09 per plant) for B. argentifolii control. At the 2 sites where E. formosa Beltsville strain was released, trials were terminated early and in- secticides were applied when B. argentifolii densities reached 4-6 live nymphs and pu- pae per leaf. Low emergence rates of E. formosa Beltsville strain may have been a major factor lowering the efcacy of this parasitoid in commercial greenhouses. R invernaderos despu\u00e9s argen- tifolii E. greenhouse-grown orna- mentals is seldom practiced by commercial producers and chemically based pest con-trol strategies prevail. Several reasons for lack of adoption of biological control bygrowers of greenhouse ornamentals have been identied and include: (1) the high costof purchasing natural enemies for mass release makes pesticides more attractive -nancially; (2) inconsistent natural enemy quality, quantity, and availability from com-mercial suppliers can adversely affect programs making growers wary of biologicalcontrol; (3) a paucity of rigorous research documenting efcacy and economic cost ofbiological control makes justication of biological control implementation difcult; (4)lack of crop and pest specic management guidelines with natural enemies for grow-ers to follow means there is no established infrastructure similar to that available forpesticides with which growers are familiar (Cranshaw et al. 1996, O'Neil et al. 1998,Parrella & Jones 1987, Parrella 1990, Parrella et al. 1992, Hoddle et al. 1997, Wearing1988). In this article we address issues which concern natural enemy efcacy andquality, and the cost effectiveness of biological control whitefly, Bemisia and Zolnerowich (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) has been identied as an effective natural enemy of B. argentifolii (Hoddle et al. 1998a). Weekly releases of three female parasitoids per plant per week obviated the need forpesticides on non-colored poinsettias commercially grown for cuttings, and use of E. eremicus is recommended for control of B. argentifolii on poinsettia stock plants in summer (Hoddle & Van Driesche 1999). However, the ability of E. eremicus to control B. argentifolii on colored poinsettia plants grown in the fall was uncertain at the time of this trial. Weekly releases of E. eremicus in small experimental greenhouses where the release rate was varied over time failed to control B. argentifolii on colored poin- settia plants grown in the fall suggesting that this parasitoid and release strategymay be unsuitable for use at this time of year (Hoddle et al. 1999). The efcacy of con-stant weekly releases of E. eremicus for B. argentifolii control on colored poinsettia plants during normal fall production periods had not been previously determined incommercial greenhouses at the time work presented here was done. Encarsia formosa Gahan Beltsville strain (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) is a Bemi- sia -adapted strain of E. formosa (Heinz & Parrella 1994). Use of this parasitoid in small experimental greenhouses at a rate of three females per plant per week pro-duced nal densities of B. argentifolii on colored poinsettias that were indistinguish- able from those on plants produced commercially with pesticides for sale at Christmas(Hoddle et al. 1997). However, in commercial greenhouses E. formosa Beltsville strain failed to control B. argentifolii on poinsettias grown for cuttings during summer whereas under similar conditions E. eremicus provided acceptable control of B. argen- tifolii (Hoddle & Van Driesche 1999). 558 Florida Entomologist 82(4) December, 1999 These results suggest that E. eremicus is the more effective natural enemy for B. argentifolii control on stock plants grown in summer and that E. formosa Beltsville strain might be more effective on colored poinsettias grown in the fall. The ability of E. formosa Beltsville strain to control B. argentifolii on commercially produced col- ored poinsettias, however, has not been determined. Here we present results thatcompare the efcacy of E. formosa Beltsville strain to that of E. eremicus against B. argentifolii under commercial growing conditions on poinsettias grown in the fall for sale at Christmas. M ATERIALS AND M ETHODS Experimental Greenhouses This experiment was conducted with four commercial growers in Massachusetts, USA, using either E. eremicus (two growers) or E. formosa Beltsville strain (two grow- ers) for B. argentifolii control in greenhouses on colored poinsettia plants grown for the Christmas market. Evaluation trials were run over the period 4 August to 7 De-cember, 1995. Site one was a 260-m 2 glass greenhouse containing 3,200 plants. Cultivars grown were \"Red Sails\", red \"Lilo\", and white and marble \"Angelika\". Site two was a 156-m 2 glass greenhouse containing 2,300 plants. Cultivars grown were white and marble \"Annette Hegg\", red \"Celebrate 2\", and \"Pink andtwo received weekly releases of E . eremicus and plants were reduced in number dur- ing the trial to satisfy spacing and sales requirements. Site three was a 168-m 2 plastic greenhouse with 1,800 plants. A single cultivar, white \"Glory V-14\", was grown at thissite. Site four was a 307-m 2 glass greenhouse, stocked with 2,881 plants. Cultivars grown were \"Celebrate 2\", marble \"Angelika\" and pink \"Gutbier V-14\". Sites three andfour received weekly releases of E. formosa Beltsville strain. Estimating Initial Whitefly Infestation Levels and Augmentation of Whitefly Numbers The colored crops at sites 1 and 2 were started from rooted cuttings produced by each grower in the spring, using cuttings that had been produced using E. eremicus as the sole control strategy for B. argentifolii (Hoddle & Van Driesche 1999). Cuttings at sites 3 and 4 were produced in-house by the growers and B. argentifolii had been controlled chemically on stock plants with foliar insecticides before cuttings were har-vested and held for three weeks in misting units for rooting. At the time of potting ateach site, 70-90 randomly selected cuttings were numbered. Each leaf on the num-bered cuttings was examined and total numbers of live B. argentifolii nymphs and pu- pae (one sampling category), and adults per plant were recorded. The average numberof nymphs and pupae, and adult whiteflies per plant was calculated for each site andcompared using a one-way ANOVA in SAS (SAS 1989) and Tukey's StudentizedRange Test ( P = 0.05) was used for means separation. At sites 2, 3, and 4 control and parasitoid release cages were stocked with poinsettia plants infested at the samenymphal and pupal density as that occurring in their respective biological controlgreenhouses (see below for more details on the use of cages). At site 1, all plants ex-amined were free of B. argentifolii and augmentative releases of adult whiteflies were made to establish a pest population in the biological control greenhouse. The controland parasitoid release cages were also articially inoculated with adult whiteflies atthe same rate as the biological control greenhouse. Hoddle & Van Driesche Control of Bemisia argentifolii 559 Whitefly augmentation. Because no whiteflies were seen on cuttings at site 1, the whitefly population there was augmented by introducing adult male and female pairsof B. argentifolii from our laboratory colony. Our intention was to introduce adult whiteflies to produce similar average per plant densities as that observed across allgreenhouses at the time of planting. To do this we released 332 adult whiteflies (166mating pairs) into the biological control greenhouse which held 3,200 plants at timeof release (week 2 of the trial). This produced an average of 0.1 adult whiteflies perplant. The control cage and parasitoid release cage at site 1 (all cages contained 10plants) were stocked with one male-female pair of adult B. argentifolii at the same time. Experimental Treatments & Weekly Population Counts for B . argentifolii Three treatments were established in each of the four biological control green- houses: uncaged plants (Treatment 1), cages with whiteflies only (Treatment 2), andcages with parasitoids and whiteflies (Treatment 3). Treatment 2 was the control, andTreatment 3 acted as a check for cage effects for whitefly development in the presenceof parasitoids. To estimate whitefly population densities on uncaged plants, three leaves (one from the bottom, one from the middle, and one from the top) of 90 plants in all exper-imental greenhouses were inspected weekly for the presence of B. argentifolii . The numbers of nymphs and pupae, adults, and whitefly exuviae from which either adultwhiteflies or parasitoids had emerged were recorded along with numbers of visiblyparasitized whitefly nymphs. Weekly population counts were made at each site untileither the grower harvested colored plants or applied insecticides because whiteflynumbers had reached unacceptable densities. Final densities of live nymphs and pu-pae per leaf for Treatment 1 in each greenhouse were compared using a nestedANOVA in SAS (SAS 1989) and Tukey's Studentized Range Test ( P = 0.05) was used for means separation. Establishing & Monitoring B. argentifolii Population Growth in Cages Treatments 2 and 3 were established in single cages in each of the four biological control greenhouses. Cages measured 153 cm (length) \u00b4 92 cm (width) \u00b4 117 cm (height), were constructed of pvc piping, and were enclosed on all sides with polyestermesh screening with a 95 m m opening size. Access to plants within cages was via two sleeves in the front of the cage and whiteflies were counted through a clear acetatepanel located between the sleeves. Each cage was stocked with 10 potted poinsettiaplants that were chosen from those examined to estimate the initial infestation levelat planting. We stocked cages with selected plants to achieve similar average densi-ties of live nymphs and pupae per plant as those in the corresponding biological con-trol greenhouses. For Treatments 2 and 3, whitefly population density estimates were made weekly on eight randomly selected plants within cages. In Treatment 3, parasitoids were re-leased into cages at a rate of three female parasitoids per plant per week. Based on anexpected 50:50 sex ratio and an emergence were placed weekly in cages at sites 1 and 2 in a single release cup. In the E. formosa Belts- ville strain release cages at sites 3 and 4, 50 parasitized B. argentifolii nymphs were placed in cages weekly. We assumed a 60% emergence rate and an all female popula-tion for this parasitoid. 560 Florida Entomologist 82(4) December, 1999 Monitoring of Insecticide-Treated Greenhouses, end of Trial Whitefly Densities, & Cost Analysis To measure the performance of parasitoids compared to conventional whitefly con- trol practices, two greenhouses treated with insecticides, one at site one and one atsite three, were monitored weekly. Live B. argentifolii nymphs and pupae were counted on each of three randomly selected leaves (one leaf from the bottom, middle,and top of the plant) on 90 randomly selected plants. Mean numbers of live whiteflynymphs and pupae per leaf were compared to those observed in the biological controlgreenhouses and parasitoid release cages. The average number of live whiteflies per leaf was determined using a sampling protocol used from previous studies (Hoddle et al., 1998a, 1999). Fifteen plants wererandomly selected from each experimental greenhouse and the number of live white-fly nymphs and pupae were recorded for each of six leaves (two leaves were chosen atrandom from the bottom, middle, and top of the plant.) The cost of biological control versus the cost of insecticides was determined at site 1 by analyzing insecticide application records for the insecticide-treated greenhouse,and the cost of using E. eremicus in the biological control greenhouse at the same site. The cost of whitefly control using imidacloprid (a systemic chloronicotinyl compound[Cahill et al. 1996]) was based on 1995 catalogue prices for Marathon \u00ae (a granular in- secticide of 1% imidacloprid, [Olympic Horticultural Products, Mainland, PA]). Thecost of using E. eremicus was based on the 1995 retail gure of $22 1000 parasit- ized T. vaporariorum nymphs. formosa Beltsville strain was us for $9 per 1000 parasitized B. argentifolii nymphs. Estimating Weekly Parasitoid Release Rates Parasitoid releases in the biological control greenhouses and parasitoid cages be- gan immediately after greenhouses were lled with poinsettias. The targeted weeklyrelease rate for both parasitoid species was three females per plant per week. Eret- mocerus eremicus is a bi-parental species (sex ratio is 1:1) and was supplied by Bene- cial Insectaries, Oak Run, California USA, as loose parasitized T. vaporariorum nymphs which had been reared on tobacco. Encarsia formosa Beltsville strain is a uni- parental parasitoid, which was reared on B . argentifolii on collard greens and supplied by American California USA, 25 loose parasitized nymphs. Parasitized nymphs were distributed throughout greenhouses and cages by plac- ing them in plastic release cups (height 3 cm; diameter, 4 cm). Release cups were at-tached to stakes that were pushed into the potting media until cups were positionedbelow the crop canopy. To estimate the number of parasitoids released per plant perweek, we measured the number of nymphs per unit weight of material sent by thesupplier, the weight of the shipment, and the percentage of nymphs from which par-asitoids successfully emerged under greenhouse conditions. Percentage emergencewas determined by returning release cups every two weeks to the laboratory and re-cording the number of nymphs from which parasitoids did and did not emerge. We as-sumed a 1:1 sex ratio for E. eremicus in our calculations. R ESULTS Initial Whitefly Infestation Levels on Cuttings at Potting There was a signicant difference across sites in the mean number ( \u00b1 SE) of live nymphs and pupae on cuttings at the time of planting (F = 44.5, df= 3, p = 0.0001). At Hoddle & Van Driesche Control of Bemisia argentifolii 561 sites 1, 2, (both E. eremicus ) 3, and 4 (both E. formosa Beltsville strain), the average number of live nymphs and pupae per plant was 0.00 \u00b1 0.00 (n = 90 cuttings) (because no immature whiteflies were found at site 1 it was not included in the ANOVA), 8.19 \u00b1 0.78 (n = 70) [a], [b], and 1.41 \u00b1 0.18 (n = 90) [c], respectively. Means followed by the same letters are not signicantly different from each other.Both the E. eremicus and E. formosa Beltsville strain treatments had one relatively high and one relatively low initial density of whiteflies. There was also a signicant difference across site in the mean number ( \u00b1 SE) of adult whiteflies per plant at time of potting (F = 8.32, df = 2, p < 0.00001). At sites 1,2, 3, and 4, the average number of live adults per plant was 0.00 \u00b1 0.00 (because no adult whiteflies were found at site 1 it was not included in the ANOVA), 0.06 \u00b1 0.05 [a], respectively. Means followed by the same letters are not signicantly different from each other. The average number of adult whiteflies perplant when averaged across all biological control greenhouses (n = 4) was 0.16 \u00b1 0.03. Actual Parasitoid Release Rates Emergence rates of adult parasitoids in the two E. eremicus greenhouses averaged 53.8% \u00b1 4.8% and 55.6% \u00b1 3.9% for sites 1 and 2 across the entire trial periods, respec- tively (Table 1). In the two E. formosa Beltsville greenhouses, weekly percentage emer- gence \u00b1 5.6% for sites 3 and 4, respectively (Table 1). The average number of female parasitoids released per plantper week at sites 1 and 2 was 2.9 \u00b1 0.2 and 3.7 \u00b1 0.31 respectively, for the two E. ere- micus greenhouses (Table 1). The average number of female parasitoids released at sites 3 and 4 was 1.9 \u00b1 0.25 and 2.4 \u00b1 0.37 per plant per week, respectively (Table 1). This average weekly release rate for E. formosa Beltsville strain were lower than the intended release rate of 3 females per plant per week because of poor emergence of par- asitoids following deployment of parasitized B. argentifolii nymphs in greenhouses. Population Density Trends for B. argentifolii Population growth of B. argentifolii in cages in the absence of E. eremicus (Treat- ment 2) was substantially higher than that observed for populations receiving para-sitoid releases (Treatment 3) (Fig. 1). In control cages at the end of the trials, numbersof live nymphs and pupae exceeded 29 and 117 per leaf at sites 1 and 2, respectively.At the end of the trials in cages treated with E. eremicus , populations of live B. argen- tifolii nymphs and pupae per leaf reached 8 and 2 at sites 1 and 2, respectively, (Fig. 1). Upon grower request, cages at sites 3 and 4 where E. formosa Beltsville strain was released were removed and trials were terminated in weeks 6 and 4, respectivelywhen insecticides were applied for whitefly control. No useful data was obtained fromcages studies at sites 3 and 4 because trials were terminated before B. argentifolii population trends became evident. Colored poinsettia plants were harvested at site 1 without the use of any insecti- cides. Two insecticide applications were required at site 2 to reduce numbers of adultwhiteflies on plants (Fig. 2). The biological control greenhouse was treated with twosulfotepp fumigations (Plantfume Beach FL]) three days apart during week 11 of the trial. Parasitoidreleases continued after fumigation and plants were harvested at week 16 withoutfurther insecticide intervention. In greenhouses receiving releases of E. eremicus (sites 1 and 2), densities of live nymphs and pupae were less than two per leaf whentrials ended. This nal density of live nymphs and pupae was acceptable to commer-cial growers producing colored poinsettias for sale at Christmas (Fig. 2).562 Florida Entomologist 82(4) December, 1999 TABLE 1.

In contrast, parasitism by E. eremicus at site 1 was not detected until week 6. Peak parasitism by E. eremicus at site 1 reached 30% at week 8 and then declined to 4-7% for the last four weeks of the trial (Fig. 3). Para-sitism did not exceed 5% in the biological control houses at the two sites in whichE. formosa Beltsville strain was released (Fig. 3). Insecticide-Treated Greenhouses Insecticide-treated greenhouses at sites 1 and 3 received one application each of imidacloprid (Marathon \u00ae) immediately after greenhouses were lled. This insecticide can give up to 12 weeks protection with a single application (Lopes 1994). Whitefly Densities at Harvest The protocol designed to evaluate the mean number of live nymphs and pupae per leaf at time of harvest on 15 randomly selected plants detected signicant differencesbetween both sites 1 and 2 treated with E. eremicus and to numbers recorded on plants in retail outlets (F = 37.94, df = 2, p = 0.0001) (Table 2). Weekly releases ofE. formosa Beltsville strain failed to reduce B. argentifolii to non-damaging densities and trials at sites 3 and 4 were terminated early and insecticides were applied to thecrop prior to the harvesting of colored plants. Consequently, similar comparisons ofwhitefly numbers in the biological control greenhouses at sites 3 and 4 with insecti-cide treated plants were not made.3 1,800 9,000 24.6 1.23 4 1,800 18,007 26.6 2.665 1,800 8,992 37.3 33.0 \u00b1 3.8 1.9 \u00b1 0.25 E. formosa 4 1 2,881 20,000 23.3 \u00b1 0.37T ONTINUED TOTAL GREENHOUSES PARASITOID EMERGENCE , AND NUMBER OF FEMALE PARASITOIDS RELEASED PER PLANT IN BIOLOGICAL CONTROL GREENHOUSES TREATED WEEKLY WITH ERETMOCERUS EREMICUS AND ENCARSIA FORMOSA BELTSVILLE released/ plant564 Florida Entomologist 82(4) December, 1999 Cost Analysis At site 1, the total cost of controlling B. argentifolii with an average weekly release rate of 2.9 female E. eremicus per plant for 14 weeks was 30 times more expensive than the use of imidacloprid for whitefly control (Table 3). Cost analysis for use ofE. formosa Beltsville strain at site 3 was not calculated as this trial was terminated early following grower intervention with foliar insecticide applications. D ISCUSSION Releases of E. eremicus at rates of 2.9-3.7 females per plant per week successfully suppressed B. argentifolii to non-damaging levels on colored poinsettias. The sales in- spection protocol detected 2-4 live B. argentifolii nymphs and pupae per leaf and plants were marketable with this level of whitefly infestation at harvest. Mean den-sities of live B. argentifolii nymphs and pupae per leaf on the 90 randomly selected plants at sites 1 and 2 were both less than two (compared to 2-4 live nymphs and pu-pae from the sales inspection protocol) when trials were ended and plants were har-vested. This larger sample size may have resulted in a more accurate assessment ofnal per leaf densities of B. argentifolii at time of harvest indicating that nal densi- ties of live B. argentifolii nymphs and pupae per leaf being less than two are commer- cially acceptable. In one of the two E. eremicus greenhouses (site 1) the crop was harvested without any insecticide applications even though B. argentifolii were deliberately introduced to produce an initial infestation of 0.1 adult whiteflies per plant, a density similar tothat seen in the other biological control greenhouses. At site 1, initial inspection of Fig. 1. Mean number of live Bemisia argentifolii nymphs and pupae ( \u00b1 SE) per lea f on poinsettia plants in the control and parasitoid release cages in the biological con- trol greenhouses treated with E. eremicus .Hoddle & Van Driesche Control of Bemisia argentifolii failed to detect nymphs prior to parasitoid releases beginning and whitefly nymphs were not deliberately introduced to produce initial nymph densitiessimilar to those seen in the other biological control greenhouses. Because initialwhitefly densities at site one were low, whitefly numbers remained consistently lowerthroughout the duration of the trial and the test of E. eremicus for B. argentifolii con- trol was not as rigorous as site 2. At the second E. eremicus release site (site 2) initial whitefly densities were higher than site 1, and biological control was successfullycombined with two fumigatory sulfotepp applications to produce commercially accept-able colored plants. Data collected at harvest indicates that growers and consumers are tolerant of light whitefly infestations on colored poinsettias and biologically based control pro-grams do not have to achieve zero whitefly densities for plants to be marketable. Tri-als subsequent to this one have demonstrated that E. eremicus can also successfully control another common whitefly pest of poinsettia, T. vaporariorum , on colored plants and that growers are able to successfully manage their own biological controlprogram using this parasitoid under commercial growing conditions (Van Driesche etal. 1999a). A major obstacle to the use of E. eremicus for biological control of B. argentifolii on greenhouse grown poinsettias is the high cost of this parasitoid in comparison to in-secticides for control of this pest. The use of E. eremicus for control B. argentifolii on Fig. 2. The mean of live Bemisia argentifolii nymphs per leaf on uncaged poinsettia plants in the biological control greenhouses treated with Eretmocerus eremicus (sites 1 and 2) or Encarsia formosa Beltsville strain (sites 3 and 4). Trial duration times at sites 3 and 4 were reduced because growers intervenedwith chemical treatments to suppress B. argentifolii population growth. Arrows indi- cate times of insecticide applications at site 2.566 Florida Entomologist 82(4) December, 1999 poinsettias grown for cuttings in 1995 was 44 times more expensive than using imi- dacloprid (Hoddle & Van Driesche 1999). In this study with colored poinsettia plants,E. eremicus was 30 times more expensive than the same insecticide in 1995. Since 1995 when this work was done the cost of E. eremicus has decreased by 62% and this parasitoid currently retails for $8.30 per 1000 parasitized T. vaporariorum nymphs (Hoddle & Van Driesche 1999). At the 1999 cost the use of E. ermicus at site 1 in this trial would have been $1.02 per single stem plant, or just 11 times more expensivethan imidacloprid. The cost of using E. eremicus in a biologically based pest management program can be reduced further by reducing the numbers of parasitoids released weekly. Oneway of accomplishing a reduced weekly release rate is to combine E. eremicus with compatible insect growth regulators (IGRs). We have identied IGRs that can be suc-cessfully used with E. eremicus (Hoddle & Van Driesche unpublished). When E. ere- micus is combined with two mid-season applications of Applaud 70 WP (ai 70% buprofezin [Agrevo USA Company, Wilmington DE]) the weekly parasitoid releaserate can be reduced by 66%. Marketable colored poinsettias are produced under com-mercial conditions using this parasitoid-IGR program at a cost of $0.38 per singlestem plant, a price more competitive with imidacloprid which can cost $0.09-$0.14 perplant (Van Driesche et al. 1999b). Encarsia formosa Beltsville strain failed to provide adequate control of B. argenti- folii at the two sites at which it was released. This result was due in part to low par- asitoid emergence rates (33-38%) in experimental greenhouses. We did not determinewhether environmental factors in greenhouses (e.g., aspects of commercial poinsettia Fig. 3. Percentage parasitism of Bemisia argentifolii in biological control green- houses treated with either Eretmocerus eremicus (sites 1 and 2) or Encarsia formosa Beltsville strain (sites 3 and 4).Hoddle & Van Driesche Control of Bemisia argentifolii 567 production that reduce efcacy of E. formosa Beltsville strain) or poor parasitoid qual- ity were responsible for low emergence rates. Because of low rates of parasitoid emer-gence, 89% of releases failed to reach the intended release rate of three parasitoidsper plant per week, a rate which has been shown to be efcacious in small greenhousetrials (Hoddle et al. 1997). During the course of our work (1994-1995) with E. formosa Beltsville strain two companies (one European and one American) attempted to com-mercialize this parasitoid. Restructuring of the European insectary resulted in E. for- mosa Beltsville strain being removed from its product line while persistent production problems (i.e., disease and hyperparasitism by Encarsia pergandiella Howard) hampered yield and promoted the ultimate loss of the only commercialE. formosa Beltsville strain colony in the USA. In addition to uncertainty of supply and post-receipt quality, inherent biological attributes may have also prevented E. formosa Beltsville strain from being an effec- tive natural enemy of B. argentifolii on poinsettias. Under time limited conditions in commercial poinsettia-production greenhouses, E. formosa Beltsville strain is disad- vantaged because it is slower in discovering B. argentifolii patches, nds fewerT ABLE 2.

The inability of E. formosa reared on either B. argentifolii or T. vaporariorum (the standard insectary host for this parasitoid) to control B. argentifolii on poinset- tias grown for cuttings (Parrella et al. 1991, Hoddle & Van Driesche 1999) or for color(Hoddle & Van Driesche 1996) suggests this species cannot be recommended for B. ar- gentifolii control on commercially grown poinsettias. In contrast, the efcacy of E. eremicus for B. argentifolii control continues to be supported by results of trials in poinsettia crops under various growing conditions.Further work on developing programs which use E. eremicus in combination with se- lective insecticides such as IGRs is needed before this parasitoid will be economicallycompetitive with currently employed control programs that rely exclusively on insec-ticides.
