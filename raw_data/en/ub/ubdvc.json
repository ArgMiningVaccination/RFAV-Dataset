The committee also considered preliminary data on the reactogenicity of H1N1v vaccines from a paediatric trial coordinated by the Health Protection Agency. The committee concluded that for childr en offered Pandemrix, one dose (that is half the adult dose) should be given to children aged over 6 months and below 10 years that are healthy or in t he clinical at risk groups as defined previously by the JCVI2 with the exception of children who are immunocompromised. Immunocomprom ised children in this age group should receive two doses (both half the adult dose) of Pandemrix that are given at least 3 weeks apart. Advice on the use of Pandemrix in children aged 10 years and above and adults remains that previously given by the committee2. Parents should be advised to look for signs of fever following H1N1v vaccination. Childhood antipyretics c an be given to treat a fever should one develop. However, they should not be given before or shortly after vaccination in anticipation of a fever si nce there is some evidence that this may make vaccines less effective. 1 European Medicines Agency advises of risk of fever in young children following vaccination with Pandemrix http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/general/direct/pr/78440409en.pdf 2 JCVI "}
