In fact, studies show that exercise can boost the effectiveness of vaccines in some people who have compromised immune systems. This has become an increasingly important factor with the development of the coronavirus vaccine. Sleep: Getting enough sleep is also incredibly important to your immune system. Poor sleep quality and the likeness of getting sick are closely linked. Adults should aim to get about 7 or more hours of sleep. The less you sleep, the more likely you are to catch an illness. Hydration: Staying hydrated is important to overall quality of life, but it's vital to your immune system. Dehydration can cause complications that can cause your body to be more susceptible to illness. Managing stress levels: Lowering your stress levels is also imperative to a strong immune system. Some ways to lower your stress levels are; yoga, meditation, journaling, or exercising. Vitamins: Taking vitamins and supplements is a helpful way to boost your immune system's response to illness. Vitamin C & D, as well as Zinc, Elderberry, Garlic, and Echinacea, are proven to help strengthen the immune system.

When the ecosystem in the gut is not in proper balance a condition known as gut dysbiosis occurs. This makes the immune system weak and can also make the person more prone to infections. Gut dysbiosis has been connected to multiple medical problems including obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's, hypertension, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and dementia. Restoring your gut health can boost your immunity and help control many non-infectious chronic diseases.
