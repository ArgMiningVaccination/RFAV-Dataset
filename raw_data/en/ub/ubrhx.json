The following link provides the number of cases and deaths globally and per country: WHO Coronavirus (COVID -19) Dashboard | WHO Coronavirus (COVID -19) Dashboard With Vaccination Data As of 27 December 2020, as the Spikevax vaccine was under evaluation by Swissmedic, there had already been over 80,000,000 confirmed cases of SARS -CoV-2 infection globally with approximately 1.8 million deaths. As of 27 February 2021, this had increased t o 113,076,707 confirmed cases of COVID -19, including 2,512,272 deaths. By 22 September 2021, there were, cumulatively and worldwide, 229,373,963 confirmed cases and 4,705,111 deaths reported to WHO. In Switzerland, C OVID -19 data are collected by the Swis s Federal Office of Public Health (BAG, Bundesamt f\u00fcr Gesundheitswesen). On 23 December 2020, there had been 421,382 positive cases, 17,504 hospitalisations and 6,406 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Cumulatively , and up to February 21, 2021, th ere had been 550,066 confirmed cases of COVID -19 (6,391.6 per 100,000 inhabitants), 23,617 hospitalisations (274.4 per 100,000 inhabitants) and 9,204 deaths (106.9 per 100,000 inhabitants). By 23 September 2021, cumulatively, there were 831,880 confirmed c Coronavirus | Dashboard (admin.ch) While hospitalisations and deaths can occur in any age group, a majority occur in people aged 50 and over, with incidence increasing exponentially with age. Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immunocompromised status, cancer and obesity are some of the risk factors for developing severe COVID -19. People with COVID -19 have reported a wide range of symptoms, ranging from no, or mild, symptoms to severe illness and death. Symptoms may appear 2 -14 days after exposure to the vir us, and may include: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea. Severe COVID -19 can cause dyspnoea, pneumonia and A RDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), thromboembolism and other conditions that may require ICU care. In addition to respiratory sequelae, severe COVID -19 has been linked to severe health problems such as myocardial injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute renal injury, neurological complications such as encephalopathy and acute ischa emic stroke. Severely infected persons may develop post -acute COVID -19 syndrome and may need months of rehabilitation. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks. There is no cure yet against C OVID -19 and, in Switzerland, at the time of the evaluation of the vaccine, only one other vaccine had received a temporary authorisation, Pfizer's Comirnaty Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 4 Quality Aspects 4.1 Active Substance CX-024414 , the active substance of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna, a single -stranded, 5' -capped mRNA full from the SARS- CoV-2 virus. The S1S2 protein sequence includes an intrinsic signal peptide at the N-terminal end and two proline point mutations (K986P and V987P ), resulting in a protein in the optimised prefusion conformation. The RNA sequence contains common structural elements, such as 5'cap, 5' and 3' UTRs, poly( A) tail. Uridine in the full sequence is replaced by N -methyl pseudouridine. The mRNA active substance is formulated with lipid nanoparticles to increase stability of the mRNA during storage and after administration, and to facilitate transfection into t he host cells. Upon uptake into the cells, the mRNA is released and translated in the cell to generate the encoded S1S2 protein antigen. The mRNA active substance is manufactured in a cell -free system, by an in vitro transcription reaction using enzymati c reagents and utilising nucleotide triphosphates, a 5'-cap structure and linearised plasmid template as starting materials. The in vitro transcription reaction is followed by several purification steps. Linearised plasmid is not a structural component of the active substance but serves as a template for the respective enzyme, thus defining the correct nucleotide sequence of the mRNA drug substance. The plasmid is produced by fermentation in established and characterised bacterial cell banks. For plasmid manufacture and control, sufficient information was provided. Manufacturing process changes of the active substance during process development, including the transfer to the manufacturing site at Lonza, Visp, proces s changes and scale- up steps were adequately described, and supporting data from comparability studies between commercial and clinical batches were provided. The active substance and its impurities were sufficiently characterised using state- of-the-art an alytical methods. Process performance qualification runs were performed , and the presented control strategy, validation data and extended characterisation results demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing active substance batches that consistently meet the predefined specifications. The specification tests and acceptance criteria were provided and include e.g. identity test, purity and impurit y testing. Analytical methods were described and non -compendial methods have been validat ed in accordance with ICH guidelines. 4.2 Finished Product COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna is a white to off -white dispersion for injection containing 100 g/0.5 mL of mRNA embedded in lipid nanoparticles (LNP s). acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, sucrose, and water for injections.

The dose to be administered to humans is 0.2 mg / mL. With respect to the pharmacodynamics of mRNA -1273, in vitro data in 293T cell s and data from mice, hamster and non- human primates (NHPs) were provided by the applicant. In cells in culture, expression of the S -2P protein was detected on the surface of cells by flow cytometry. However, no detailed analysis of the expressed S -2P prot ein was performed in vitro . It was not studied whether membrane- bound S -2P protein could be proteolytically cleaved from the cell membrane to form a soluble protein outside of cells. The submitted data suggest that the modified mRNA is unstable and that the usage of N1- methyl -pseudouridine enhances its translatability in the target cells. Prime -boost immunisation of mice (young and aged), hamster and NHPs with mRNA -1273 by the intramuscular route resulted in a dose- dependent robust induction of a humoral r esponse characterised by S -protein binding IgG antibodies specific for the ACE2- receptor -binding domain and the S1- N-termimal domain. A prime -boost immunisation induced a stronger response than a prime alone. The prime-boost regimen induced neutralising an tibodies in all three species. The boost was needed to induce a decent neutralising antibody titre. Human convalescent plasma contained the same or fewer S protein binding and neutralising antibodies than sera from vaccinated animals. A detailed dose- response analys is in mice showed that a dose of 5 \u00b5 g mRNA -1273 was needed for maximum induction of the humoral response. In aged mice, it was shown that a boost was necessary for the induction of neutralising antibodies. Analysis of IgG2 and IgG1 revealed expression of both IgG subclasses in a balanced way in all three species, indicating a vaccine- mediated Th1 response. The mRNA -1273 induced a T- cell response in mice . It was shown that a 1 \u00b5 g mRNA -1273 dose induced a Th1 cells, suboptimal doses induced Th2 responses as measured by the expression of IL- 4, IL-5 and IL- 13. In NHPs, a dose -dependent increase in Th1 responses was observed in CD4 cells , and Th2 responses were low. No substantial CD8 T- cell responses were detected after mRNA -1273 vaccination. Challenge studies were performed in mice (young and aged), hamster s and N HPs. Before challenging, the animals were immunised (prime -boost, intramuscular) with mRNA -1273. For challenge studies in mice , a mouse -adapted SARS -CoV-2 MA virus was used whose S protein was genetically changed ( two amino acid changes at positions Q498Y / P499T) to interact with the mouse ACE2 protein. An intranasal challenge with SARS -CoV-2 MA induced a respiratory disease characterised by weight loss, lung haemorrhage and viral replication in the respiratory tract. Untreated, mice started to recover aft er 4 days. The mRNA -1273 vaccine protected mice in a dose - dependent manner , showing protection from doses equal to and higher than 1 \u00b5 g. Histological data showed vaccine- mediated reduced inflammation and reduced pneumocyte hyperplasia and reduced SARS- CoV-2 MA virus in the lung. In vaccinated animals, PCR analyses showed reduced viral load in the lung and nasal turbinates. Suboptimal vaccine doses below 1 \u00b5 g did not result in enhanced respiratory disease (ERD). In order to evaluate vaccine- mediated protection of SARS- CoV-2 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 infection in older animals, aged mice (1 year old) were studied. In aged mice a prime- boost vaccine regimen was needed to induce neutralising antibodies. In comparison to mRNA -1273, an inactivated SARS- CoV (DIV) was not induce a humoral immune response. Whereas mRNA -1273 induced low levels of inflammatory cytokines, the inactivated SARS -CoV induced substantial levels of inflammatory , including IL-1, IL-6, MIP -1 and G -CSF. The challenge of older mice with the adapt ed SARS- CoV-2 MA virus caused more severe disease. A 1 mg intramuscular dose of the mRNA -1273 protected the ani mals. A suboptimal dose of 0.1 \u00b5 g resulted only in partial protection, but did not induce signs of ERD. The mRNA -1273 vaccine also protected hams ters -WA1/2020, 105 PFU). Vaccine- protected animals did not lose weight , and viral load was reduced from day 2 after challenge. Furthermore, the lung histology showed reduced inflammation. In NHPs , 100 g mRNA -1273 vaccine was needed to reduce the viral load in both BAL and NS samples. The vaccine could not completely inhibit the virus replication in NHP s in the lower or upper respiratory tract. At the point of approval, no long -term efficacy data were evaluated in animals after vaccination with mRNA -1273. A long -term study in NHP s is ongoing , and data should be available by the end of 2021. No studies with respect to safety pharmacology were conducted, which can be accepted based on the absence of safety signals from GLP toxicity studies. Pharmacokinetics Standard pharmacokinetic studies with respect to absorption, metabolism and excretion (ADME studies) were not performed with mRNA -1273. Detailed ADME studies are not usually required for vaccines by international agreement , and the lack of these data is acceptable due to the nature of the mRNA -LNP product. The limited submitted information in rats suggests that mRNA -LNP particles are primarily taken up by professional phagocytes such as dendritic cells and macrophages. The modified mRNAs are expected to be degraded within hours in cells , and antigen expression peaks two days post - injection , with signs of clearance four days post -injection . No ADME studies were performed with the isolated lipid components. Data for very similar lipids were described in rats by the applicant , suggesting that the lipids are primarily excreted in urine and faeces and cleared from the body one week after injection. SM -102 half -lives were determined to be in the range of hours in serum and selected organs such as liver and spleen. No biodistribution was determined in animals with the COVID -19 mRNA -1273 vaccine. Instead, biodistribution data for the CMV vaccine mRNA -1647 obtained in rats were submitted. This can be accepted, as the mRNA -1647 is formulated with the same lipids as the mRNA -1273, and the biodistribution is primarily determined by the lipid components of the mRNA -LNP particle. The mRNA - 1647 contains six different modified mRNAs , and each mRNA molecule was measured in selected organs / tissues by a multiplex branched DNA (bDNA) assay. Concentrations for all six mRNA -1647 constructs were detectable in plasma and tissues in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Following a single IM dose, the maximum concentration (T max) observed in plasma was 2 hours for all constructs and was followed by a rapid elimination phase with a half -life (T1/2) of 3 - 4 hours. SwissPAR 13 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 The highest mRNA -1647 concentrations were observed at the injection site, followed by the proximal and distal lymph nodes and spleen , consistent with distribution via the lymphatic system. In muscle, lymph nodes and spleen, the maximum observed concentration (C max) was between 2 and 24 hours post -dose. The T 1/2 was calculated as 15 hours for muscle, 30- 35 hours for lymph nodes and 63 hours for spleen. Levels of mRNA above the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) w ere determined in most tissues analysed, including eyes, brain, liver, lungs , heart, GI tract, bone marrow and gonads. Overall, only a relatively small fraction of the administered mRNA -1647 dose distributed to distant tissues, and the mRNA constructs did not persist beyond 1 to 3 days in tissues. Toxicology Standard GLP-compliant toxicity studies were not performed wit h mRNA -1273. Instead, six GLP - compliant toxicity studies were performed with several modified mRNA vaccine products formulated with the four lipid components into mRNA -LNP particles, comparable with mRNA -1273. These vaccines were evaluated in Sprague Dawle y rats after three or four intramuscular weekly doses (hind limb) and recovery periods of two weeks . The lack of a toxicity study with mRNA -1273 can be accepted based on the fact that the safety profiles of all evaluated mRNA -LNP vaccines were comparable, indicating that the observed effects were mainly due to the lipid components of the vaccine product. All studies were performed over a time frame of six weeks at most, which is in accordance with international guidelines and can be accepted based on the ki netics of these types of vaccines. All animals developed the expected antibody responses. Generally, the vaccines showed a favourable safety profile, with reversing or reversible effects that can be attributed to the provoked immune reaction. The findings were dose -dependent and included injection site reactions, effects on lymph nodes and spleen, effects on cytokine levels and elevated body temperatures, haematology changes, effects on liver cells (and reduced body weight changes and food intake. Injection site findings included swelling , oedema and erythema, associated with a mixed inflammation consisting of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes. As a secondary effect of the hind limb injection, some sciati c nerve inflammatory changes were also observed. Draining lymph nodes in the injection area were enlarged , associated with a perinodal mixed cell inflammation. In the spleen, minimal to mild decreased cellularity of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath was observed at 10 g/dose and was often associated with an increase in macrophages. H aematology, coagulation and clinical chemistry changes observed at 10 g/dose included increases in neutrophil, eosinophil and large unstained cell (LUC), and reticulocyte and platelet counts; increases in APTT and fibrinogen; increases in globulin and decreases in albumin . At high doses, increases in IL-1, IL-6, IP-10, and mRNA -LNP v accines show a favourable safety profile, and they were studied with adequate safety margins (up to more than 370 -fold the human dose). GLP-compliant genotoxicity studies were performed -102 and PEG -2000 -DMG . The genotoxicity evaluations included i n vitro analyses (bacterial reverse mutation tests, mammalian cell micronucleus tests) and, for SM -102 only, in vivo analyses (bone marrow micronucleus tests). For in vivo evaluations with SM -102, two studies were performed. In one study involving the use of a luciferase mRNA -LNP, no significant increase in the incidence of micronuclei was noted. In the second study , involving the use of mRNA -1706, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of SwissPAR 14 / 26 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 micronucleated immature erythrocytes was found. In the absence of any in vitro clastogenicity, it can be concluded that inflammatory responses induced by the mRNA -LNPs contributed to this finding. A GLP- compliant developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART ) study was performed in female Sprague Dawley rats with mRNA -1273. A human clinical dose of the mRNA -LNP vaccine was administered twice before mating and twice during gestation. The only noteworthy findings were the development of wavy ribs and increased nodules on ribs, but these were not considered adverse as there was no effect on pup growth or viability. The wavy ribs and rib nodules resolve postnatally without medical intervention. Final Risk Assessment In preclinical studies, the mRNA -1273 vaccine showed a very good hu moral and cellular immune stimulation towards a Th1 response. A prime- boost vaccine regimen resulted in a stronger response, and a boost was needed especially in aged animals. Protection from SARS -CoV-2-mediated disease was shown in all species tested. Bas ed on the pharmacokinetics, it can be assumed that most of the mRNA -1273 stays local ly at the injection site. However, a limited amount of the vaccine is distributed systemically. This systemic distribution might be favourable for the immune response. On t he other hand, it also poses an extended risk with respect to the development of unpredictable adverse events. The safety profile is acceptable, and the findings can be explained by the expected immune response towards the vaccine. It can be concluded that , in the light of the current pandemics, the benefit of the vaccine outweighs the risk. The mRNA -1273 vaccine can be approved from the preclinical perspective.

The mRNA encodes for the full -length SARS -CoV-2 protein modified with 2 proline substitutions within the heptad repeat 1 domain (S -2P) to stabilise the spike protein into a prefusion conformation. The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is non -replicating, and is expressed transiently mainly by dendritic cells and subcapsular sinus macrophages. The protein undergoes post -translational modification and trafficking resulting in properly folded, fully functional Spike protein that is inserted into the cellular membrane of the expressing cell(s). The expressed, membrane- bound spike protein of SARS -CoV-2 is then recognised by immune cells as a foreign antigen. This elicits both T -cell and B -cell re sponses to the spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV-2 in the vaccinated individual. The immune response to the viral spike protein then prevents attachment and entry of SARS -CoV-2 into the host cells, thus preventing COVID -19 disease. Immunogenicity Phase 1 Study Immunogenicity Data A phase 1, dose -ranging safety and immunogenicity study (20- 0003) was carried out and was still ongoing at the time the vaccine was granted temporary authorisation by Swissmedic. Four doses were being tested : 25 g, 50 g 100 g and 250 g, administered to 120 healthy adults (males and non-pregnant females, aged 18- 55, 56 -70, and 71 years old). The immunogenicity follow -up was 119 days post first vaccination (57 days for the 50 g dose as the 50 g dose was added later). The 100 g dose of mRNA -1273, administered as two injections 28 days apart , resulted in the induction of neutralising antibodies (nAbs) in all participants by 1 week after the second injection . After a single injection of 100 g of Spikevax, binding antibodies (bAbs ) against spike glycoprotein were detectable in all participants in all three age strata, with further increases observed following the second injection. The serum bAb titres were higher after the two injections of the 100 g dose than after the two inject ions of the 25 g dose (age group 18 to 55 years of age). Also, two injections of 100 \u00b5g induced nAb responses that were similar to those measured in recipients of the 250 \u00b5g dose. Since two injections of 100 \u00b5g led to a lower incidence of reactogenicity t han two injections of 250 \u00b5g, the 100 g dose was preferred. The 50 \u00b5g dose induced humoral immune responses that were comparable with those induced by the 100 \u00b5g dose (data for the 50 \u00b5g dose only available up to day 57), and a similar response was SwissPAR 16 / 26 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 observed across all age cohorts. However, higher responses were observed after the second injection in older adults receiving the 100 g dose compared to the 50 \u00b5g dose . For cellular immunity (an exploratory endpoint), Th1- directed CD4+ T- cells were induced across all age groups. There was a limited Th2 -directed response, which is desirable as it indicates a lesser risk of antibody -enhanced disease. The humoral response (binding and neutralising antibodies) and cellular response were also tested against a panel of convalescent sera. The post -vaccine humoral response increased with dose and was comparable with or above that observed in convalescent sera for both the 50 and 100 g doses. Specifically, binding IgG antibodies against the spike protein (stabili sed spike antigen, S -2P) were observed to have higher median values at day 43 and beyond in the Spikevax group than in the convalescent sera control group. Neutralising activity was observed for the 100 g mRNA -1273 dose as of day 36; the neutralising acti vity was higher than that in the convalescent sera control group, and the median titres remained in the same range as the median titre in the convalescent sera control group at Day 119 across the age strata. The study is ongoing, and analyses on day s 209 and 394 are planned. Phase 2a Study (P201) Immunogenicity Data Based on the initial data from the above phase 1 study, two dose levels (50 \u00b5g and 100 \u00b5g) were chosen for evaluation in the phase 2a study. Safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity (levels of specific binding antibody (bAb) and neutralising antibody (nAb)) were studied in two age cohorts: Cohort 1 with 300 participants ( 18 to < 55 years old) and Cohort 2 with 300 participants ( 55 years old). The participants received either mRNA -1273 (the Spikevax vaccine) or saline placebo control (0.5 mL) as an intramuscular (IM) injection on Day 1 and Day 29. Within each age cohort, 100 participants received mRNA -1273 50 \u00b5g, 100 participants received mRNA -1273 100 \u00b5g, and 100 participants received saline placebo. Generally , comparable neutralising and binding antibody responses were measured in the serum of participants who received either 50 g or 100 g doses of Spikevax administered 28 days apart. Even though the neutralising antibody titres after the first injection , though still very low, were somewhat higher after the 100 g dose (day 29), the titres rose substantially for both doses after the second injection. For the binding antibodies, responses at Day 29 were slightly higher in participants who received 100 g of mRNA -1273 than in those who received 50 g of mRNA -1273. At the time of the primary analysis of safety and immunogenicity data, participants had completed Day 57 study procedures. These data were evaluated for the initial temporary authorisation of Spikevax. Follow -ups are planned up to day 394 (Month 13). Results will be submitted at different time points and are part of the requirements for a change from a temporary to a definitive authorisation. Phase 3 Study (P301) Immunogenicity Data www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Immunogenicity data for Study mRNA -1273- P301 were not yet available at the time of the temporary authorisation by Swissmedic. 6.2 Dose Finding and Dose Recommendation Results of Study 20 -0003 showed a consistent dose response across age groups by several measures of humoral immunogenicity for both binding and neutrali sing antibodies. The advancement of the 100 g dose (administered as two injections, 28 days apart) to the Phase 2a and 3 studies was based on several observations: Two injections of 100 g stimulated serum bAb titres greater than two injections of 25 g in the 18 to 55 age group; Also in the 18 to 55 age group, two injections of 100 g induced nAb responses similar to those measured in recipients of the 250 g dose; Two injections of 100 g led to a lower incidence of reactogenicity than two injections of 250 g; Even though the 50 \u00b5g dose did not show pronounced differences compared to the 100 \u00b5g dose, the 100 \u00b5g dose was chosen because of comparable and acceptable reactogenicity and slightly higher immunogenicity. The 250 \u00b5g dose was only tested in the 18 -55 age group and was not pursued further due to high reactogenicity. The need for a second dose was based on the following observations: Peak titres of binding and neutralising antibodies across age groups and clinical trials were generally seen 7- 14 days after the second dose (on day s 36-43 post first dose). Decreases in titres became apparent soon thereafter and were reported until day 57 in the phase 2 study and day 119 in the phase 1 study. However, in the majority of participants, the antibody levels were generally sustained within the upper range or above those observed in human convalescent comparator sera. Neutralising antibody responses were generally comparable between age cohorts or superior in the younger participants. In both the phase 1 and phase 2a studies and across all age strata tested, the humoral immune response in terms of induction of antibodies binding the S protein and virus neutralising ant ibodies showed that two mRNA1273 doses given 4 weeks apart resulted in substantially higher titres compared to responses after only one dose. While binding antibody levels generally started to rise after the first vaccination (day 15), this was not always seen for neutralising antibody responses , which were induced mostly after the second vaccination. Reactogenicity was also considered in the dose- finding process. After the first vaccination, solicited systemic adverse events were reported by 5 participants (33%) in the 25 g group, 10 (67%) in the 100 g group, and 8 (53%) in the 250 g group. Solicited systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination and occurred in 7 of 13 participants (54%) in the 25 g group, all 15 in the 100 g group, and all 14 in the 250 g group, with 3 of those participants (21%) reporting one or more severe events. None of the participants had fever after the first vaccination. After the second vaccination, no participants in the 25 g group, 6 (40%) in t he 100 g group, and 8 (57%) in the 250 g group SwissPAR 18 / 26 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 reported fever; one of the events (maximum temperature, 39.6\u00b0C) in the 250 g group was graded as severe. Thus reactogenicity was highest with the 250 g dose. Evaluation of safety clinical laboratory values of grade 2 or higher and unsolicited adverse events revealed no patterns of concern. 6.3 Efficacy Phase 3 Study The ongoing phase 3 pivotal study of mRNA- 1273 is a randomised (1:1 Spikevax versus normal saline control), stratified (by age and health risk), observer -blind and placebo- controlled trial in approximately 30,400 participants. The trial enrolled participants 18 years of age and older. There were 99 clinical trial sites, all in the USA. Two 100 g doses were administered four weeks apart. Around 40% of participants had risk factors for severe COVID- 19 and/or were over 65, and 75% of participants were under 65 years of age. 48% of study participants were female, 52% male. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES To demonstrate the efficacy of mRNA -1273 to prevent COVID- 19 in persons without prior SARS- CoV-2 infection (per protocol set, primary efficacy analysis). To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of 2 injections of the mRNA- 1273 vaccine given 28 days apart. The primary efficacy endpoint required a PCR confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infection more than two weeks after the second dose of vaccine, along with pre -defined symptoms of C OVID -19. The pre - defined symptoms included: The parti cipant must have experienced at least TWO of the following systemic symptoms: Fever ( 38\u00baC), chills, myalgia, headache, sore throat, new olfactory and taste disorder(s), OR 19 7 3012 www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 The participant must have experienced at least ONE of the following respiratory signs/symptoms: cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, OR clinical or radiographical evidence of pneumonia; AND The participant must have at least one NP swab, nasal swab, or saliva sample (or respiratory sample, if hospitalised) positive fo r SARS- CoV-2 by RT -PCR. An event -based, first interim analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was conducted using a data cut -off of November 7, 2020. A total of 27,817 participants randomi sed 1:1 to vaccine or placebo with a median of 7 weeks of follow -up post -dose 2 were included in the per -protocol efficacy analysis. In the vaccinated group, as compared to the placebo group, there was a relative reduction in the incidence of COVID -19 in the period starting 14 days post -dose 2: Efficacy in preventing c onfirmed COVID -19 occurring at least 14 days after the second dose of vaccine was 94.5.0% (95% CI: 86.5%, 97.8%) with 5 COVID -19 cases occurring in the vaccine group and 90 COVID -19 cases occurring in the placebo group. Efficacy data from the final scheduled analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (data cut -off of November 21, 2020, with a median follow -up of >2 months post -dose 2) confirmed a vaccine efficacy (VE) of 94.1% (95% CI: 89.3%, 96.8%), with 11 COVID -19 cases in the vaccine group and 185 COVID -19 cases in the placebo group. This was consistent with results obtained from the interim analysis. The VE in this analysis when stratified by age group was 95.6% (95% CI: 90.6%, 97.9%) for participants and 86.4% (95% CI: 61 .4%, 95.5%) for participants 65 years of age. See table below. Primary Efficacy Analysis: Confirmed COVID -19 (symptomatic COVID -19 requiring positive RT -PCR result and at least two systemic symptoms or one respiratory symptom), regardless of severity starting 14 days after the 2nd dose - Per-Protocol Set Age Group (Years) COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna (Spikevax) Placebo % Efficacy (95% CI)* Subjects N COVID -19 Cases n Incidence Rate of COVID - 19 per 1,000 Person - Years Subjects N COVID - 19 Cases n Incidence Rate of COVID -19 per 1,000 Person - Years Overall (18) 13,934 11 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 75 630 0 0 688 7 41.968 100% (NE, 100) At the time of initial temporary authorisation by Swissmedic, the power of the study did not allow a conclusion to be drawn on vaccine efficacy for persons over 75 years of age. As the study is ongoing, data on the duration of protection will be available later, taking into account the fact that, after 6 months of median follow -up, the placebo group participants were to be offered the vaccine. This was a necessary protocol amendment due to the fact that Spikevax became available in the US under an Emergency Use Authori sation in December of 2020. H owever, all study participants will still be followed for 24 months post -vaccination. KEY SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy of mRNA -1273 to prevent severe COVID -19. To evaluate vaccine efficacy (VE) against a secondary definition of COVID -19. The secondary efficacy analyses shown below were done at the time of the data cut -off for the primary efficacy analysis. Prevention of Severe COVID -19 (Per Protocol Set) To be considered as severe COVID -19, the following criteria had to be met: a confirmed COVID -19 as per the Primary Efficacy Endpoint case definition, plus any of the following: Clinical signs indicative of severe systemic illness, Respiratory Rate 30 per minute, Heart Rate 125 beats per minute, SpO2 93% on room air at sea l evel or PaO2/FIO2 < 300 mm Hg, OR Respiratory failure or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), (defined as needing high -flow oxygen, non -invasive or mechanical ventilation, or ECMO), evidence of shock (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, diastolic B P < 60 mmHg or requiring vasopressors), OR Significant acute renal, hepatic or neurologic dysfunction, OR Admission to an intensive care unit or death. Secondary efficacy analyses suggested a benefit of the vaccine in preventing protocol -defined severe COVID -19. There were 30 (0.2% of all per protocol placebo participants) severe COVID -19 cases in the placebo group vs. 0 cases in the vaccine group. Confidence intervals for the VE against severe COVID -19 cases could not be estimated, however, due to insu fficient power of the study. Vaccine Efficacy (VE) Against a Secondary Case Definition of COVID -19 (Per Protocol Set) The secondary case definition of COVID -19 was according to the CDC case definition and required only ONE clinical symptom from an expanded list as well as a nasopharyngeal or nasal swab / saliva sample positive for SARS -CoV-2 virus. There were 11 cases in the vaccine group and 221 in the placebo group. VE for this secondary case definition was 95.1% (95% CI: 91.1 to 97.3%). Further secondary analyses also suggested a benefit of the vaccine in preventing COVID -19 starting 14 days after the first dose, and in preventing COVID -19 in individuals with prior SARS -CoV-2 infection, although available data for some of these outcomes did not allow firm conclusions to be drawn. SwissPAR 21 / 26 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Following the Emergency Use Authorisation granted by the FDA on 18 December 2020, A mendment 6 of the phase 3 study added that all participants in the placebo arm who opt to cross over from placebo to active vaccination would have the opportunity to receive the vaccine. In any case, Moderna intends to continue the ongoing pivotal phase 3 study P301 with all participants followed up until 24 months after the second dose. 6.4 Safety The safety of mRNA -1273 is largely based on data from the pivotal phase 3 study using data snapshots dated 11 Nov 2020 and 25 Nov 2020. The safety analysis set included 30,350 study participants: 15,184 received mRNA -1273 and 15,165 received placebo. The safety analysis set included all randomi sed participants of the phase 3 study who received one or more vaccine or control doses. After the first safety interim analysis of the phase 3 study , which took place on November 11, 2020 (median follow -up of 7 weeks following the second dose), the Sponsor submitted additional follow -up data with a cut -off date of November 25, 2020 . This represents a median of 9 weeks (>2 months) of follow -up post -dose 2. Deaths, other serious adverse event s and unsolicited adverse events of interest were examined and showed no significant differences between the placebo and the vaccine groups. Reactogenicity was assessed in the ongoing phase 3 clinical trial by observation of the solicited local and systemic ARs that occurred during the 7 days following each injection (i.e., on the day of injection and on 6 subsequent days). Unsolicited AEs, observed or reported, were assessed during the 28 days following each injection (i.e., on the day of injection and 27 subsequent days). AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or study participation will be assessed through Day 759 or withdrawal from the study, as will the MAAEs and SAEs. Post-marketing surveillance is ongoing since temporary marketing authorisation was granted. It is based on national and international data from spontaneous reporting (pharmacovigilance) and from post-authorisation studies, see t he RMP summary on Swissmedic's website, RMP summaries (swissmedic.ch) . Reactogenicity Solicited local ARs were report ed by a majority of participants in the mRNA -1273 group and were reported at a higher incidence in the mRNA -1273 group (92.4%) than in the placebo group (29.3%) after any injection. Solicited systemic ARs were reported by the majority of participants in the mRNA - 1273 group and were more prevalent in the mRNA -1273 group (84.1%) than in the placebo group (53.5%) after any IP injection. In the mRNA -1273 group, the incidence and severity of solicited systemic ARs appeared to increase after the second injection. For differences in reactogenicity in the placebo versus the vaccine groups after dose 1 and after dose 2, please see the table titled \" mRNA -1273 P301 Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions Within 7 Days After Dosing (Safety Analysis Set* )\" in the prescribing information attached to this document. SwissPAR 22 / 26 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Commonly identified solicited adverse reactions were injection site pain, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, erythema/redness at the injection site, axillary swelling and tenderness, nausea/vomiting, fever. The frequency and severity of these reactions increased in the mRNA -1273 group after the second dose. Adverse Reactions As above, see also the \" Tabulated list of adverse reactions \" identified at the time of temporary authorisation in the attached copy of the original prescribing information. The incidence of the 28 days af ter any injection were generally similar in participants who received mRNA -1273 and those who received placebo. The incidence was also comparable in adults 18 to < 65 years of age compared with participants 65 years of age and older who received mRNA -1273 (21.5% versus 23.1%, respectively). There was no difference in the incidence of unsolicited TEAEs based on SARS -CoV-2 serology at baseline. A slightly higher incidence of all hypersensitivity events in the vaccine group versus the placebo group (1.5% vs. 1.1%, respectively), which was driven mainly by injection site rash (n=37 (0.2%) vs. n=1 (<0.1%)), (0.2%)). An SMQ of angioedema revealed a balanced incidence of 0.3% in each study arm. Autoimmune diseases: The frequency of autoimmune- related adverse events is comparable, for both arms of trial P301, with 28 (0.2%) of subjects in the placebo arm and 32 (0.2%) of subjects in the vaccine arm reporting such events. Facial palsy ( three cases in the verum arm, one in the placebo arm) has been observed. A total of 8 deaths occurred in Study mRNA -1273 -P301, with 4 deaths occurring in the mRNA -1273 group and 4 deaths occurring in the placebo group. None were attributed to COVID -19 nor considered related to study product. The causes of death were consistent with those that are expected in the population enrolled in the study. Post -marketing Data Very rare hypersensitivity/anaphylactic events were identified internationally post -marketing and led to the instruction to monitor vaccine recipients for at least fifteen minutes following dosing. Within a few months after temporary authorisation, cases of myocarditis were identified through pharmacovigilance surv eillance with a frequency that was higher in vaccine recipients after the second dose than what would be expected as background incidence. See https://www.swissmedic.ch/swissmedic/de/home/humanarzneimittel/marktueberwachung/health- professional -communication--hpc -/dhpc -mrna published updated p rescribing information. Other very rare adverse events were identified later through the international and Swiss pharmacovigilance systems.

SwissPAR 23 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 6.5 Final Clinical and Clinical Pharmacology Benefit Risk Assessment Benefit At the time of the pre -defined primary endpoint analysis, the median follow -up of the phase 3 study was two months. There were 196 cases of C OVID -19 during the 2- month median follow -up, of which 185 occurred in the placebo group and 11 in the vaccine group. Spikevax thus showed a vaccine efficacy of 94.1% (with 95% CI of 89.3% to 96.8%). The lower limit of 89.3% for the 95% CI for the primary endpoint exceeded the pre -specified 30% margin established by the WHO and FDA, and thus the endpoint was met. Reduced severe COVID -19 disease (0 vs 30 cases in mRNA -1273 vs placebo groups, respectively), and immunogenicity lasting for at least 119 days at last analysis were further data showing a beneficial effect of the vaccine. Uncertainties and Risks The median follow -up of 2 months is too short to obtain sufficient long- term efficacy and safety data. In particular, duration of protection is as yet unknown, as are vaccine efficacy in certain age groups or the protection against hospitalisation and deaths (the latter has been shown using epidemiological data since the temporary authorisation was granted). There are currently no established immune correlates of protection. Persistence of immunogenicity is unknown. Whether the 50 microgram dose may be effective in younger age groups and cause less reactogenicity has not been tested. As seasonal influenza vaccines and other vaccines were not given concurrently with the COVID -19 vaccine, there are no data on the possibility of simultaneous vaccinations with other types of vaccines. Potential interactions between vaccine and medicines have not been studied. The need for a second dose in previously infected persons has not been tested. No data, or very limited data, are avail able on pregnant and lactating women, immunocompromised persons, and paediatric subjects. Protection against developing variants is unknown. There are no data yet on asymptomatic infections in vaccine recipients and potential spread to contacts. There are no long- term data on rare, unexpected risks that may appear with time or as more people get vaccinated. The reactogenicity (especially systemic) may be severe in a small percentage of vaccine recipients, even more so after the second dose. Some cases of anaphylaxis have been observed, which led to the recommendation to monitor vaccine recipients for a certain time period following injection. Not known at the time of temporary authorisation, cases of myocarditis were identified in very rare cases after vaccination, which led to publication of a DHPC and changes to the prescribing information. Benefit / Risk Assessment Spikevax was the second COVID -19 vaccine to receive a temporary marketing authorisation in Switzerland. Given the pandemic situ ation as described above under \"Medical Context\", the high vaccine efficacy, and the lack, so far, of any prohibitive safety signals, the benefit -risk assessment is overwhelmingly SwissPAR 24 / 26 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 positive. The phase 1, 2 and 3 trials are ongoing and will continue to provi de immunogenicity, safety and efficacy data. These ongoing studies as well as other studies planned by the company (see also RMP Summary) will provide answers with time and will be necessary for the conversion from a temporary to a full authorisation. Based on the totality of the scientific evidence available so far, the known and potential benefits of Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine for the prevention of COVID -19 in individuals 18 years of age and older. Foll ow-up of the phase 3 trial, post -marketing and \"real world\" studies as well as international safety surveillance are very important and will be considered before a change from temporary to full authorisation can be made. In view of the rolling submission procedure and temporary authorisation in accordance with Art. 9a TPA, the Swiss prescribing information will be updated as needed.

Information for Professionals - Covid -19 Vaccine Moderna 3 / 15 Contraindications COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna is contraindicated in individuals with known severe allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna. Warnings and precautions Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis has been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following administration of the COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is essential following vaccination. The second dose of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals. Persons at Risk of Bleeding As with other intramuscular injections, COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna should be given with caution in individuals wi th bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia, or individuals currently on anticoagulant therapy, to avoid the risk of haematoma following the injection. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety -related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in persons with severe febrile illness or acute infection. Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness Individuals may not be fully protected until 14 days after their second dose. As with all vaccines, vaccination with COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna may not protect all vaccine recipients .

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is very important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to repor t any suspected adverse reactions online via the ElViS portal (Electronic Vigilance System). You can obtain information about this at www.swissmedic.ch. Overdose No cases of overdose have been reported. Properties/Effects ATC code J07BX03 Mechanism of action COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna encodes for the pre -fusion stabilized Spike protein of SARS -CoV-2. After intramuscular injection, cells take up the lipid nanoparticle, effectively delivering the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into protein. T he mRNA delivery system is based on the principle and observation that cells in vivo can take up mRNA, translate it, and express protein antigen(s) in the desired conformation. The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is nonreplicating, and is expressed transiently. The protein undergoes post -translational modification and trafficking resulting in properly folded, fully functional Spike protein that is inserted into the cellular membrane of the expressing cell(s). The Spike protein is membrane bound, mimicking the presentation of natural infection. Information for Professionals - Covid -19 Vaccine Moderna 9 / 15 The expressed Spike protein of SARS -CoV-2 is then recognized by immune cells as a foreign antigen which elicits both T -cell and B -cell responses. The immune response to t he Spike protein results in functional antibody and T -cell responses and in the generation of memory immune cell populations. The specific mechanism of protection for the SARS -CoV-2 virus remains under investigation. Pharmacodynamics Not applicable. Clinical efficacy The randomised, placebo- controlled, observer -blind Phase 3 clinical study (NCT04470427) excluded individuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 6 months, as well as participants who were pregnant, or with a known history of S ARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants with stable HIV disease were not excluded. Any vaccine within 28 days prior to or after any dose of Covid -19 Moderna vaccine was not permitted , with the exception of the i nfluenza vaccine, which could be administered 14 days before or 14 days after any dose of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna. Participants were also required to observe a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins prior to the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. A total of 30,351 subjects were followed for a median of 92 days (range: 1 -122) for the development of COVID -19 disease post dose 1 . The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per Protocol Set or PPS), included 28, 207 subjects who received either COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna (n=14,134) or placebo (n=14,073) and had a negative baseline SARS -CoV-2 status. The PPS study population included 47.4% female, 52.6% male, 79.5% White, 9.7% African American, 4.6% Asian, and 6.2% other. 19.7% of participants identified as Hispanic or Latino. The median age of subjects was 53 years (range 18 -94). A dosing window of - 7 to +14 days for administration of the second dose (scheduled at day 29) was allowed for inclusion in the PPS. 98% of vaccine recipients received the second dose 25 days to 35 days after dose 1 (corresponding to -3 to +7 days around the interval of 28 days). COVID -19 cases were confirmed by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT PCR) and by a Clinical Adjudic ation Committee. Vaccine efficacy overall and by key age groups are presented in Table 3.

Evaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines. Preclinical data COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna has not been evaluated for carcinogenicity or male infertility in animals. Given the short -term administration of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna, long -term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna are not required. Animal Toxicology Intramuscular administration of M oderna COVID -19 Vaccine (or other Moderna mRNA investigational vaccines) using the same formulation every 2 weeks up to 4 doses to rats at doses ranging from 9 to 150 mcg/dose resulted in transient injection site erythema and oedema, body temperature increases, and a generalized systemic inflammatory response. Transient and reversible changes in laboratory tests (including increases in eosinophils, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen) were observed. Transient hepatocyte vacuolation and/or Kupffer cell hypertrophy, often observed without liver enzyme elevations, was observed and considered secondary to the systemic inflammatory response. In general, all changes resolved within 2 weeks. Mutagenesis SM-102, a proprietary lipid component of CO VID-19 Vaccine Moderna, is not genotoxic in the bacterial mutagenicity and the human peripheral blood lymphocytes chromosome aberration assays. Two intravenous in vivo micronucleus assays were conducted with mRNA therapies using the same lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation as COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna. Equivocal results observed at high systemic concentrations were likely driven by micronuclei formation secondary to elevated body temperature induced by a LNP -driven systemic inflammatory response. The genotoxic risk to humans is considered to be low due to minimal systemic exposure following intramuscular administration, limited duration of exposure, and the negative in vitro results. Reproductive Toxicity In a developmental toxicity study, 0.2 mL of a vacci ne formulation containing the same quantity of mRNA (100 micrograms) and other ingredients included in a single human dose of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 28 and 14 days prior to mat ing, and on gestation days 1 and 13. SARS -CoV-2 antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on lactation day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine- related adverse effects on female fertility, pregnancy, embryo foetal or offspring development or postnatal development. No data are available of mRNA1273 vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. Information for Professionals - Covid -19 Vaccine Moderna Approved 12 Jan 2021 13 / 15 Animal pharmacologic and efficacy data Nonclinical pharmacology evaluations in young and aged wild- type mice (Balb/c, C57/BL6, and C4B6 strains), and non- human primate (rhesus macaques, NHP) animal models were conducted to test for immunogenicity of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna and protection from SARS - CoV-2 challenge. These nonclinical studies demonstrated that COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna was tolerated, was immunogenic, protected animals vaccinated at dose levels as low as 1 mcg/dose in mice and hamsters and 30 mcg/dose in NHPs from viral replication in both the nose and lower respiratory tract after viral challenge, and did not lead to enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) at protective or sub -protective dose levels in these animal models. In addition, Th1 -directed CD4 T- cell responses were measured in all animal species and a robust CD8 response was measured in mice.
