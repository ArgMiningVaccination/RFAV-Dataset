Brazil intends over five years to produce a vaccine in conjunction with biomedical research centre Butantan Institute and US pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) via a $US480 million ($A533.81 million) investment, making available 41 million doses over that time frame until Brazil's labs can produce their own. The first year of the program will see 15 million doses - three per child - administered. The government hopes to reach at least 80 per cent of Brazil's 5.2 million girls in the targeted age group. The World Health Organisation says cervical cancer is the second most common form of the disease in women worldwide, each year bringing 250,000 deaths and 500,000 new cases. "}
