Big Pharma has done a remarkable job developing Covid-19 vaccines in record time \u2014 but that's just half the battle. Now comes the logistical challenge of getting those vaccines into the arms of people around the world. In the U.S., the rollout has been significantly slowed by the lack of a coherent national plan. Indeed, pretty much since the start of the pandemic, there has been no coordinated nationwide effort. Responsibility for Covid-19's response was passed like a hot potato from the federal government to states to counties to cities to local health departments. This has seriously hampered vaccine delivery and, by extension, our capacity to contain Covid-19 in the immediate future. The good news is that the Biden administration seems to be focused on creating a real, workable national strategy. The problem has not been so much a shortage of vaccines but rather getting vaccines into the arms of citizens once health providers receive them. Say a clinic receives 20,000 vials of the vaccine, and it has just a matter of days before those vials expire. It's a huge organizational effort to reach out to patients, schedule and confirm their appointments, get them on-site for injections, and then arrange second doses. We recently had an inquiry from a prospective customer who had messaged 400,000 patients about vaccine availability. The customer's website immediately crashed under the weight of the response and ended up improperly scheduling appointments for 50,000 people. Technology can help. Indeed, tech can play a large part in making sure vaccine rollout goes as smoothly and efficiently as possible so you don't have a situation where 400,000 patients try to visit your website to book injections or get information, at which point your website goes down. That's just not acceptable. How can technology be an enabler for a smooth and efficient vaccine rollout? It can allow health providers to seamlessly communicate with their patients at scale and do it in a way that doesn't require high-hurdle security measures. The right technology can also make appointment scheduling frictionless, allowing patients to book their visits with a single click without creating a new account, setting up log-in credentials or printing out medical forms. Technology can simplify the whole process. Fortunately, today, there are technology solutions that can stitch all those pieces together in a single platform, which is critical because if all those pieces are not connected end to end, there will be multiple points of failure. Imagine the chaos if you rely on one system for messaging with patients, another system to interact with patients via a chatbot, and yet another system for patient scheduling and follow-ups. All of those steps must be frictionless, or the patient experience and desired outcome invariably suffer. The reality is that with the vaccine rollout, time is of the essence, and any delay or system glitch could cost lives. For health providers, speed to impact is critical right now, and that can only be achieved through coordinated technology that has connectivity to all core operations. The room for error is greatly reduced when a health provider can rely on a single, integrated system that brings all the pieces together and minimizes the number of handoffs. I firmly believe that technology will not only be critical for the vaccine rollout but will also dramatically improve patient engagement overall. Before Covid-19, we knew our health system was inefficient, but the pandemic has shone a light on the shortcomings in a way that, frankly, has been startling to many. Now we have the opportunity to address those issues and make sure we do a much better job going forward. Technology will be the key. Even with the heroic efforts of Big Pharma, Covid-19 is not going away anytime soon. We'll likely need new vaccines every year or every other year into the indefinite future. Health providers can rise to the challenge by using technology systems that seamlessly connect all patient touch points and deliver a level of care, engagement and health outcome that was not possible before.
